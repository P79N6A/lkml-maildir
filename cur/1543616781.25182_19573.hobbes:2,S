This is not the typical setup...

Sun sets the MAC from the machine ID on all network interfaces by
default. Not Solaris, AFAIU it is done by the PROM.

Why should DaveM convince Linus to get Sun to change their mind on NIC
setup?
Especially if it works just fine for 99.95% of Suns, and has the bonus that
you can track each machine by a _single_ MAC, even if you change NICs or
add more?
