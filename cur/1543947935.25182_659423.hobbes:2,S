Yes, yes, I see, the patch was fine.

OK, thanks.
So, the only reason why we can't kill kill_pid_info_as_uid() and just use
kill_pid_info() is that USB uses .si_code = SI_ASYNCIO. The latter means
that SI_FROMUSER(info) == T.
I assume that it is not an option to change USB to use .si_code > 0, yes?
