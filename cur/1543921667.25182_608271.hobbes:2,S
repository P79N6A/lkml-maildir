It's hidden now so it causes any obvious failures any more. Just
subtle ones which is much worse.
But why not just disable it?  It's not critical functionality,
just a optimization that unfortunately turned out to be incorrect.
It could be made correct short term by not freeing the pages until
vunmap for example.

This option could only be safely set in architectures that don't
care about caching attribute aliases or never remap kernel pages
uncached. That's not x86, powerpc, ia64 at a minimum.
I think the only good short term fix is to turn your ifdef CONFIG_XEN
into a #if 0
