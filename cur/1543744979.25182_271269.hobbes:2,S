Okay. Any reason why you've put "start, end" before "prio_tree_node" ?
The other way around would seem to make things a lot easier.

Yes, they're a bit confusing :-) It would actually be nice if you
could write a little paper describing this particular type of radix
priority search tree, since it differs quite a bit from the original.
Also, the original paper is comparably difficult to obtain if you
don't have a university library at hand. Better documentation of how
prio_tree works might also encourage new uses of it.
Thanks,
