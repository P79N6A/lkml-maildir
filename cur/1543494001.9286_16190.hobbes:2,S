Here in Italian Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), we have been
designing, building and using our VLIW chips in APE ('86, 10GFlops),
APE100 ('89, 100GFlops peak perf) and APEmille ('99, 1TFlops peak perf)
Massively Parallel Supercomputers for years
(
http://chimera.roma1.infn.it/ape.html
).
similar approaches are being used by main DSP chips.
