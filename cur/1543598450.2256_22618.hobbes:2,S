(A) Do not check "build aic7xxx firmware".
(B) kbuild 2.5 only selects the db*.h file that matches the current db
    library, instead of assuming that the first db*.h that it can find
    should be used.
(C) If the aic7xxx maintainer would let me fix the aic7xxx kbuild
    files, nobody would ever have these problems again.
