Hi,
I am having problems settng the DMA ( hdparm -d1 /dev/hda ) on a RH9 
2.4.28 Linux machine.
I always get the following error messages:
HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operatopm mpt @er,otted
using_dma = 0 (off)
The Disk ST3120026A is properly recognized. It appears that the 
motherboard is not supported. ( I am running linux on a Shuttle XPC with 
the ATI Radeon 9100IGP / IXP150 Chipset.
Has anyone an idea how to get this dma setting work ?
Will that chipset be supported in the future ?
Thanks
Alex
