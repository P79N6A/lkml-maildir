The last arg of request_irq and free_irq has to match - it is the id
that distinguishes different users of the same irq.  As there never
was a request_irq with pdev you get that error on free_irq.
The module unload still takes place.  So trying to cat /proc/interrupts
later on will stumble over the still installed handler with the mantis
id - unfortunately, the driver (and especially DRIVER_NAME) is no longer
in memory ...
Ciao, ET.
