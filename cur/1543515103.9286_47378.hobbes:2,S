I gave up on 2.3.25 as none of the patches posted to this list would
apply to a clean kernel and due to what seemed to be a muddle about
them. More of the same here ?
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce 
-DCPU=586 -march=i586   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c fbmem.c
fbmem.c: In function `fb_mmap':
fbmem.c:530: `PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT' undeclared (first use in this function)
fbmem.c:530: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
fbmem.c:530: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [fbmem.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/drivers/video'
