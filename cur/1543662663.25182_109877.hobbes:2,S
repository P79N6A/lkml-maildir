The generic device api has a shutdown method for this.  And in the non panic
case we use it.  Not a lot of devices have it implemented but it exists.
And except that it doesn't have a restriction that it can't block is pretty
much what you want.

The API is already done...
We just don't trust the dying kernel enough to use it during a panic.
