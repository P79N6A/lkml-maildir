With linux-2.4.0-test8, all my scsi disks appear duplicated:
Detected scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 3, lun 0
[...]
Detected scsi disk sdb at scsi0, channel 0, id 4, lun 0
[...]
Detected scsi disk sdc at scsi0, channel 0, id 3, lun 0
[...]
Detected scsi disk sdd at scsi0, channel 0, id 4, lun 0
I think this is caused by the addition of module_init(init_sd);
at the end of drivers/scsi/sd.c.
