Hi !
For what it's worth, I did try out this patch for my problem also
without any noticable difference.
The problem being that the kernel hangs after a dma timeout in the
partition detection phase during bootup for speeds higher than udma 44.
This is an IBM-DTLA-307030 connected to a hpt366 pci card on a BH6
motherboard.
