Indeed. The hassle I'm thinking of is the reverse situation (and please
correct me if this does not apply). Say for example I run a web server.
I have customers and they have customers (lets call them CCs :). Somewhere
along the path between me and CCs there is such a misbehaving device.
The CCs try to get to my customers website and fail (I assume). If my
assumption is right, what's the probability of the CCs ever informing my
customer that there is a problem? I think it's more likely they would
just move on to another site offering the same thing, especially since
they would mostlikely need to load the site in order to get the
appropriate contact details.
Basically the mostlikely end-result is I don't know what there is a
problem and my customer doesn't know that there is a problem but they're
just not getting as many hits to their site that they otherwise would.
Ofcourse, this all depends if such a situation is possible. If it is
possible would it affect dns and mail in a similar manner too?
