FALSE.  Old apps are by definition already in place.  "all you need to 
do..." is an impossible condition to satisfy.

Userspace APIs can change, as long as they remain backwards compatible.
Just follow LKML to see all the flack people get, when userspace APIs 
change in an incompatible way.  Or heck, just look at the changelog for 
the patches we revert, when such brokenness is detected.
Finally, until an API is actually in a kernel release, it has the 
potential to change.  That's just a fact of Linux development.  I 
certainly understand trying to get stuff out ahead of a kernel release, 
but you must understand the negative consequences of doing so, when 
something goes wrong.  Like it did here.
