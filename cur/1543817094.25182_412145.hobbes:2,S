Sure, but is there any gain in making flags 64-bit on 64-bit machines when
we cannot use more than 32 bits in there anyway?

In that case perhaps we should be enforcing flags==0 so that future
flags-using applications will reliably fail on old flags-not-understanding
kernels.
But that won't work if we later define a bit in flags to mean "behave like
old kernels used to".  So perhaps we should require that bits 0-15 of
`flags' be zero and not care about bits 16-31.
IOW: it might be best to make `flags' just go away, and add new syscalls in
the future as appropriate.
