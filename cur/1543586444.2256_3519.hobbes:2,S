Instead of doing all this stuff in the kernel, you could simply update
symlinks to properly installed files at boot time.
Putting _files_ in the kernel is plain silly.  This is unreclaimable
memory, folks.  There is no need to special case an operation as simple
as reading a file.  [I think this about firmware images too, but that's
another thread]
