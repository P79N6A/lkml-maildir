I currently have the equivalent of 8 of these in my system (Compaq NC3131,
quad ethernet..)
  Bus  2, device   4, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 5).
                                           ^^^^
      IRQ 10.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=56.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xcb7ff000 [0xcb7fffff].
      I/O at 0x7c00 [0x7c1f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xcfe00000 [0xcfefffff].
it is the same chip, this particular interface is 10mbit/half duplex, and
all the interfaces transfer 1G+/day (some small files, some larger than 500 megs)
with no problems, I should note this:
eth0: OEM i82557/i82558 10/100 Ethernet, DE:AD:BA:BE:CA:FE, IRQ 10.
  Receiver lock-up bug exists -- enabling work-around.
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Board assembly 009542-001, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
  General self-test: passed.
  Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
  Internal registers self-test: passed.
  ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x24c9f043).
  Receiver lock-up workaround activated.

etc etc, for every interface.
I'm up to 2.4.10, it's worked fine on 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.4.5-8, and 2.4.10 so far.
(I didn't use the kernels not mentioned)
			Good luck.
