Well, OK, but your usage isn't quite optimal.  The fibre channel
transport class retains a list of ports per host, so your maintenance of
an identical list in zfcp_adapter duplicates this.
However, we can put this in for now and worry about removing all of the
fc transport class duplication from zfcp later.
