No, you are _very_ right about that.

Well, what I do is boost their priority and make the timeslices of non
interactive apps smaller. And sometimes they do need small bursts of
using a lot of cpu.

The reason X is special is that it uses a lot of CPU, and it can be
continually using a lot of CPU, but it is "interactive" - it probably
requires the lowest scheduling latency of any other interactive process
because it runs the mouse, screen, keyboard etc, things that obviously
can't make use of much buffering, if any.
If you wanted X to be treated as any other process, thats fine, use
renice 0. It will be given low priorities when using lots of CPU
though.
