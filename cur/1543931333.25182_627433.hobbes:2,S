Subject: [patch 30/60] Freezer: Fix APM emulation breakage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

2.6.23-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
patch cb43c54ca05c01533c45e4d3abfe8f99b7acf624 in mainline.
The APM emulation is currently broken as a result of commit
831441862956fffa17b9801db37e6ea1650b0f69
"Freezer: make kernel threads nonfreezable by default"
that removed the PF_NOFREEZE annotations from apm_ioctl() without adding
the appropriate freezer hooks.  Fix it and remove the unnecessary variable flags
from apm_ioctl().
Special thanks to Franck Bui-Huu <vagabon.xyz@gmail.com> for pointing out the
problem.
