Err, what? If it's on by default...
A old BIOS that doesn't know about it won't switch it off.
A BIOS that does know about it will leave it (or maybe offer an option to
 disable it)
If neither of the above are true (Ie, a BIOS bug) and it's switched off
by the time Linux boots, I think we'd have heard about it by now, as MII
users would notice a lack of features.
regards,
Dave.
