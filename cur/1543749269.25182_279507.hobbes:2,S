Hi Frank,
no unfortunately it did not work.
The "panics" are different, the kernel seems to be able to
recover from panics ... 
Attached is an archive with ver_linux output, my config file,
and a log file. You might find this to be more useful this time,
as I was able to do several things to make it "crash" at one
point I did a remote login in to this computer and that caused
a crash as well. Definitely a lot more crashes I was able to
capture ....
Kind Regards,
rudi
