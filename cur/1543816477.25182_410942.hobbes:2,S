Hmm ..dont follow you here. Are you saying the above is the current
behavior (say in 2.6.16-mm1)? AFAICS that is not true because 
arch_init_sched_domains (which handles both bootup & cpu hot-add cases) 
doesnt return any error back to its caller.
Also note that build_sched_domains can be called from CPUset code too
(partition_sched_domains) when we modify the exclusive property of a CPUset.

I don't know. Is load balancing an absolute critical feature that
without it system bootup and cpu hot-add should be failed? Also note
that we may be able to do partial load balancing (between threads of a
CPU) even when there is memory allocation failure.
Regarding giving administrator hints of allocation failure, the printks in 
build_sched_domain do give those hints.

Ok ..Will let Ashok take care of adding __cpuinit prefix.
