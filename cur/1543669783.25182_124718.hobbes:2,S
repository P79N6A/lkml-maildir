Hello,
I hit some problems porting the Tekram DC395x driver to Kernel 2.5.6x and 
would like to ask for a bit help.
I have tried to contact the Maintainer of that Driver around 3-4 times now and 
unfortunately didn't get a reply on my mails, so I have started to port the 
driver myself but I'm no Kernel GURU so I hit on some minor problems with 
structure items not being found etc.
If someone is interested and willing to help me then please reply to me, so I 
can sent you the stuff I have done so far.
If someone did the port already then please also do contact me.
greetings,
Ali Akcaagac
