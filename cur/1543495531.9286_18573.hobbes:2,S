Hello!
   Always I thought that if some file used by some running program 
   (its binary file or libraries used by it) then you cannot write to that
   file and getting "Text file busy". But today I did by error
   "strip libc.so.BLAH" (my current active libc) and system go boom
   instead of reporting busy textfile. On boot that file appeared to be
   zero length. All described was with 2.2.6, so I do not know is it already
   known and fixed.
   Also with 2.2.8 my updatedb complains on boot:
   "Switching to sync(2) instead of bdflush(2)"
Bye,
    Oleg
