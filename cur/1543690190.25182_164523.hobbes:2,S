Bah, this patch slipped my mind. How many drivers actually use 
->save_state()? From a quick look, it looks like: 
1. drivers/ide/pci/sc1200.c
2. drivers/net/irda/vlsi_ir.c
3. drivers/scsi/nsp32.c
4. drivers/serial/8250_pci.c
Of those, only (1) actually does anything interesting. (2) and (3) only 
print a message, and (4) appears to be trivial to fold into ->suspend(). 
What do you think about just fixing those up?
