I mentioned already yesterday, that I have exactly the same oops.
So I added several printk's and found out that it isn't really the
if-branch with the ata_ar_get, that is executed immediately before
the oops. (Neither of your suggested messages is reached.)
   It's rather that ide_cdrom_do_request is entered with rq->falgs=0x420
and hence the following branch called:
        } else if (rq->flags & (REQ_PC | REQ_SENSE)) {
                return cdrom_do_packet_command(drive);
m.
BTW: I'm using the same VIA IDE PIC controller like Randy. But it
   worked with all stable releases and all unstable until 2.5.9.
