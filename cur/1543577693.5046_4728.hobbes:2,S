Umm.  No.  The object of LFS stuff is so that programs that can't
handle large files don't shoot themselves in the foot.  You don't
need to pass O_LARGEFILE over the protocol and knfsd doesn't need
to handle it.  But with out specifying O_LARGEFILE you should
be limited to 2GB on 32bit systems.
Moving some of the LFS checks into the VFS does sound good.  
When I looked at one of the BSD's a while ago, they had
a max file size in (the superblock?) and the VFS did basic
max file size checking.  And I think it handled all of the LFS
API at the VFS layer as well.  Alan these are two seperate
but related issues.
Putting the LFS checks, & max filesize checks into the VFS sounds
right for 2.4.x because it fixes lots of filesystems, with just a
couple of lines of code.
