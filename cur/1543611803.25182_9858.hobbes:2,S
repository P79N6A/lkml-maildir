Hi
After having bootet 2.4.16 vanilla on an dual piii-system, I saw the
following messages:
invalidate: busy buffer
invalidate: busy buffer
invalidate: busy buffer
They appear during the execution of vgscan. The same kernel on an other
machine with the same version of userland-utilities for lvm but other
hardware doesn't show anyone of these messages. What do they want to
tell me? Has anybody else seen this messages?
I can give you an detailed report about the hardware I am seeing this
messages on if intrested.
