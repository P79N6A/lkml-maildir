Hi,
  Looking at the second loop in elevator_linus_merge(), it is possible for
requests to have their elevator_sequence go negative.  This can cause a
v long latency before the request is finally serviced.
  Say, for example, a request (in the queue) is jumped in the first loop
in elevator_linus_merge() as "cmd != rw", even though its 
elevator_sequence is zero.  If it is found that the new request will
merge, the walking back over requests which were jumped makes no test for
an already zeroed elevator_sequence.  Hence it zero values can occur.
  With high default values for read/wite_latency, this hardly ever occurs.
  A simple fix for this is to test for zero before decrementing (patch
below) in the second loop.
  Alternatively, should testing in the first loop be modified?
Mark
