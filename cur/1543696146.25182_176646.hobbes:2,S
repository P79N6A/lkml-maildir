Remove the alignment stuff. pci_alloc_consistent() does it for you,
see Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt:
[...]
The cpu return address and the DMA bus master address are both
guaranteed to be aligned to the smallest PAGE_SIZE order which
is greater than or equal to the requested size.  This invariant

You don't want consistent mapping for the data buffer.
Either you pci_map_single() the whole kmalloced() area and you sync it
when needed or you turn this code into usual, per skb, pci_map_single()
calls and you remove the big Rx data buffer.
