The current per-container reclaim scheme does reuse a lot of code. As far
as code maintenance is concerned, I think it should be easy to merge
some of the common functionality by abstracting them out as different
functions. The container smartness comes in only in the
container_isolate_pages(). This is an easy to understand function.

Don't we break the global LRU with this scheme?

I think the problem would be figuring out where to allocate memory from?
What happens if a software zone spans across many hardware zones?

I think binding the resource controller and the allocator might be
a bad idea, I tried experimenting with it and soon ran into some
hard to answer questions
1. How do we control the length of the zonelists that we need to
    allocate memory from (in a container)
2. Like you said, how do we share pages across zones (containers)
3. What happens to the global LRU behaviour
4. Do we need a per_cpu_pageset assoicated with containers
5. What do we do with unused memory in a zone, is it shared with
    other zones
6. Changing zones or creating an abstraction out of it is likely
    to impact the entire vm setup core, that is high risk, so
    do we really need to do it this way.

The reclaim mechanism proposed *does not impact the non-container users*.
The only impact is container driven reclaim, like every other new feature
this can benefit from good testing in -mm. I believe we have something
simple and understandable to get us started. I would request you to consider
merging the RSS controller and containers patches in -mm. If too many people
complain or we see the problems that you foresee and our testing,
enhancements and maintenance is unable to sort those problems, we know
we'll have another approach to fall back upon :-) It'll also teach us
to listen to the maintainers when they talk of design ;)
