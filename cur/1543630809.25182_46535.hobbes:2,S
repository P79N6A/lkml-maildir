Initially, I thought this was an dumb question, but it's not! If you
are doing a lot of work on kernels remotely, it just might be a
good reason to configure your remote machine(s) to boot off the network.
Then, since the kernel you are booting is local to your machine,
the boot-server, you can change it at will until you get it right.
The remaining problem is how one trips a reboot if the remote machine
doesn't come up correctly. That problem can be handled by temporarily
changing panic() to a hard reset.
