Indeed, and I hope it gets merged, giving people the chance to test out
different schedulers easily, without having to do patching, de-patching,
re-patching and blah blah blah.
But somehow I doubt it'll get merged now. My bet is that it won't even be
taken into consideration, for the same reasons that ultimately drove Con
Kolivas to giving up on development of SD. And if it's so, chances are
people will get tired of trying to get it merged. :/

If I read the announcement correctly, those are the ones referred to as
'ingosched' and 'staircase' :)
