Hello,
please excuse, if this is not the right place to ask.
I´m editor of the german magazin c´t. One of my co-workers -- Andreas
Stiller, our processor expert -- told me, that there are more and more
requests for linux versions of his CPU-testing tools. He is willing to 
port them (if necessary, he would even port them from his beloved
Pascal/Delphi to C :-)
But what he needs is a way to execute certain routines of his programms 
with ring 0 priority. So is there a way to get this for a user process?
Is it possible w.o. writing the whole programm as a kernel driver? 
Perhaps with a loadable module, that does a callback ?
Would someone volunteer to write such a driver/module as a project for our
magazine ?
thanks in advance, juergen
