I think it's coincidental.  AFAIK, there was no report of increased
transmission failures.  Two known problems with these firmwares are
1. timeout on FLUSH if NCQ is in use on certain drives
2. bricking after power off (so, the failure is almost always during
   BIOS probing during boot)

This is transmission error.  Most common causes are power related or
unreliable connection especially if backplanes are involved.  Is the
problem still reproducible?  If so, can you please try to move it to
different power connector and SATA port and see what changes?
Thanks.
