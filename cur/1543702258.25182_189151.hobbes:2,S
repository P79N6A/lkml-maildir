   [PATCH] Rename legacy_bus to platform_bus
   From: Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com>
   I've seen this patch floating around.  Not sure the origin, but it's
   surfaced on lkml and also when I was poking around handhelds.org CVS for
   iPAQ patches:  on non-PCs, particularly system-on-chip devices but not
   just there, you have a custom "platform bus" that is the root of pretty
   much all other devices and buses.
   It's something I wanted to make sure people didn't forget; to make sure
   the legacy_bus didn't get "legacied out of existence."  ;-)
