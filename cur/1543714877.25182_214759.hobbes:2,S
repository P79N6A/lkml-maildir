Hi Mark,
Just another question (I think you've already told me once
but I can't remember :P). Do you have HT enabled on your
system? If so, you should have CONFIG_SCHED_SMT=y with -mm
kernels. If not, did you get to the bottom of why oprofile
with linus kernels says the system is P4 / Xeon, while with
mm kernels, it is a P4 / Xeon with 2 hyper-threads?
