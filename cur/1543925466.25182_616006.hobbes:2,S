At least for NVIDIA controllers, loading the AHCI driver when the BIOS
is set to IDE mode is not recommended by NVIDIA.  Any AHCI workarounds
in the BIOS are likely to be disabled when set to IDE mode.  In practice
we don't expect to see a lot of users running an AHCI controller in IDE
mode unless they have explicitly disabled AHCI from the BIOS or the
system builder has some specific reason for shipping IDE mode by default
(like support for some legacy DOS or Win9x tools)
