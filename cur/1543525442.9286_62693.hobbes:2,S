You are completely missing the point.  It is *intentional* that
isa_writeb() is slightly different from writeb().  isa_writeb() exists
to ease the transition from an old ISA interface (or lack thereof) to a
newer interface which uses ioremap/writeb.
Old ISA drivers do everything under the sun... they directly access I/O
memory.  they use writeb() without ioremap.  they ioremap, then directly
access the ioremap'd memory.  All of that is wrong, and all of that can
be (a) properly cleaned up with ioremap/writeb, or (b) quickly cleaned
up with isa_xxx.
