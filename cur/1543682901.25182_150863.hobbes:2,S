I'm willing to reconsider it.
So basically we'd have a CONFIG_NET_XFRM, and things like
AH/ESP/IPCOMP/AH6/ESP6/IPCOMP6 would say "select NET_XFRM"
in the Kconfig where they are selected.
Then when CONFIG_NET_XFRM is not set all the xfrm interfaces
called from non-ipsec non-xfrm source files get NOP versions.
Is this exactly what Andi's patch did?  Just send it on
so we can integrate this.
We actually lost a lot of code in other areas of the networking, for
example Andrew Morton and I made many bogus function inlines
undone because they made the code too large.
