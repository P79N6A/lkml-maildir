Over on the freebsd-questions mailing list you can see desperate
people trying to convert Linux systems over to that other OS to
escape Linux 2.2.xx NFS. This is kind of serious, you know?
I'm doing my part to save these lost souls... anybody else up
for last-chance emergency tech support? (scan for subjects like
"can freebsd understand ext2?", then help the person solve
their Linux problems at nfs.sourceforge.net or wherever)
