Well, here's _my_ stupid BS and (intentional) FUD question: 8)
Does anybody know if XP actively performs progressive power 
management actions as the CPU temperature increases inside the 
normal operating range? If this were done somewhat linearly 
starting at "medium rare", instead of only at "well done" to 
save the hardware, wouldn't it look like the reported anomaly?
Always suspicious ;)
