Yeah, thats basicly what I was thinking. Right now I'm trying to think
of any kind of filesystem that could support the general concept of 
"Fast Searching", but be somehow unable to export this capability as a 
set of indices on file attributes....
Ok. I give up. It seems like the right abstraction to me.

That is a pretty awesome idea. It should be done in its own specialized
filesystem though. QueryFS. If the change-notification mechanism in the
kernel was robust enough (a big if), the rest could be done with a
userspace filesystem (via FUSE). Mount a query, cd into it, run grep,
write a little bash script... Very unixy.
