Hi all
I have added a system call to the kernel 2.6.3.
Can someone tell me, if I have to recompile gcc or glibc inorder to
use that system call from user space. Right now its required
to do
#define __NR_syscallname 274 /*(syscall number)*/
static inline _syscall1(.....); /*stub*/
inside my own header file from user space.
Will recompiling gcc or glibc will update header files
in /usr/include directory so that I dont need to include
above statements in my header file?
Thanks
Sushant
