I was quoting from the GCC manual (providing the documentation
implementations are required to provide of implementation-defined
behaviour); of course the subclause numbers are different in C99 (from
which the subclause numbers in the GCC manual are given) from those in
C90.  Perhaps once all the documentation for implementation-defined
behaviour in C99 is present I'll go over what's required to document it
all relative to C90 as well.

Just because you've created a pointer P, and it compares bitwise equal to
a valid pointer Q you can use to access an object, does not mean that P
can be used to access that object.  Look at DR#260, discussing the
provenance of pointer values, which arose from extensive discussion in the
UK C Panel, and if you think it should be resolved otherwise from how we
(UK C Panel) proposed then raise your position on it at a meeting of your
National Body before the next WG14 meeting.
