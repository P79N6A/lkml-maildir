I'm satisfied that, for filesystems at least, all the module races can be 
solved without adding start/stop, and I will present code in due course.
However, Rusty tells me there are harder cases than filesystems.  At this
point I'm waiting for a specific example.
For filesystems, we rely on the filesystem code itself to know when all users 
have gone away.  If somebody is still executing in a filesystem module after 
all umounts are done, it's a horrible nasty bug.  We might still want to play 
games with checking execution addresses of processes to see if anybody is 
still in a module, but that would just be for debug; sys_delete_module can 
rely on the filesystem's opinion about whether a module is quiescent or not.
Somebody please give me an example of why this same strategy will not
work for all types of modular code.
