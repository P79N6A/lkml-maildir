It only makes sense for broken irq controllers. And most aren't. You can
likely ignore it - and note how even on an x86, most of the irq controller
code _does_ ignore it.

We have to take the interrupt - we can't just drop it on the floor. And
some stupid interrupts controllers _will_ ignore it.
In particular, if an edge-triggered interrupt comes in on an x86 IO-APIC
while that interrupt is disabled, enabling the interrupt will have caused
that irq to get dropped. And if it gets dropped, it will never ever happen
again: the interrupt line is now active, and there will never be another
edge again.

You likely don't have this problem at all. Most sane interrupt controllers
are level-triggered, and won't show the problem. And others (like the
i8259) will see a disabled->enabled transition as an edge if the interrupt
is active (ie they have the edge-detection logic _after_ the disable
logic), and again won't have this problem.
