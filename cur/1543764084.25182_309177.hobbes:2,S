Subject: [patch 0/5] Hotplug firmware loader for Keyspan usb-serial driver

Here is another stab at making the keyspan firmware easily loadable with
hotplug. Differences from the previous version,
- keep the IHEX parser into a separate module.
- added a fw-y and fw-m install targets to kbuild which will install a
  driver's firmware files in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/firmware.
01 - Add lib/ihex_parser.ko.
02 - Adapt drivers/usb/serial/keyspan.ko to use request_firmware/load_ihex.
03 - Program used to dump the firmware headers to IHEX formatted files.
04 - Result of converting the firmware.
05 - Add "make install_firmware" and the related fw-$(CONFIG_FOO) stuff.
