Looks to me (a kernel know-nothing, looking at 2.4.19) that since
inode_dir_notify is defined as a static inline function (in
include/linux/dnotify.h), no separate definition is being emitted.
(This inline seems to check whether a notify needs to be done, and
calls __inode_dir_notify if necessary.)  __inode_dir_notify *is* a
regular function, but it doesn't seem to be exported, which I believe
means it can't be referenced by a module.
