Hi Amit,
I'm a little bit busy to look at this now, however someone
is looking into all these refcounting problems.
If you would like to narrow it down a bit, check that the
request queues that are allocated are all released when the
driver is unloaded (drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c blk_alloc_queue
and blk_cleanup_queue). Just stick a couple of printks there
if your debugger isn't working.
