   I'm afraid I won't be able to answer this question, since I'm
   leaving for a 3-week vacation in about 50 minutes and I need my
   firewall functional until then. :-) Maybe other people who have
   seen this problem can experiment further.
Ok, regardless I'm very confident netfilter is doing something
very bad.
Essentially it is feeding SKBs into IPv4 receive processing which
have a NULL skb->dev, that has always been illegal.  Now it OOPSs
so we can spot such violations.
