I think the fact that it works with FreeBSD should have been enough
to show that 'excessive' doesn't need to be qualified.
The question is, how is CD burning of raw data different from
CD burning of ISO images, in respect to Linux drivers for the
hardware, and why does FreeBSD not suffer from this ailment?
