Alright... So you have drm at the lower level, and the fb sits ontop of 
that... The fb just becomes a user of the DRM... No merge necessary 
then, because all the actual hardware access, memory allocation etc 
would live in drm? Is that right? And all the 2D code would also move 
into the DRM? (IIRC the DRM just has 3D stuff in it yes? IMO It would 
made sense to have all the acceleration & hardware access in the DRM 
together rather than in a separate place... Correct?)
