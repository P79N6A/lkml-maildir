longjmp() out of signal handlers has a fine tradition, not just for
threading but also code written for systems where SIGCLD doesn't
interrupt select(), to pick a real example.  Admittedly such code
doesn't have to be written that way on Linux, but it does exist and
has been run on Linux.  I doubt such code ever uses sigaltstack().
About co-operative threading: one of the points is that the locks are
cheaper, and it's possible for a thread to disable/enable pre-emption
very fast, with no system calls or locked memory cycles.  In that
environment, longjmp() or setcontext() out of timer signals makes sense.
Many years ago I looked at a paper about fixups from signal handlers,
an ML run-time environment on SunOS I think, and they decided that
longjmp() from the handler was not a reliable strategy.  What they did
instead was to change the instruction pointer in the sigcontext, and
return from the handler.  This works on Linux too, but there are two
disadvantages: 1. two system calls instead of one (which is an issue
when these are a high rate of SIGSEGVs for memory management); 2. the
code is necessarily architecture specific, whereas longjmp() from
timer signals is relatively portable.
