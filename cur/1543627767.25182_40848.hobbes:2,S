Basically right now DMA on CD-ROM devices is "disabled" due to the
fact that ide-cd.c is pasing struct packet_command through the rq->special
field. This is subject to change soon becouse I'm right now adpting ide-cd
to use the recently introduced struct ata_request stuff.
So it doesn't make much sense if you test it - becouse the issues are just well
known. However if you see an IDE xx which contains a "fix ide-cd blah blah" in
the log - I would be really glad if you could have a look in to it.
