The point is that it's not actually a thread-based problem - the priority
can't be inherited via the traditional mutex-like manner. There is no
connection between a thread and an I/o it has already issued and so you
can't transfer a priority from a blocked thread to an issued-but-blocked
i/o....

Dave.
