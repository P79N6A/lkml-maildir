   $300
 Here's a rough breakdown (FPGA $ => 
http://makeashorterlink.com/?F23722699
    $52 for 8 (eight!) Spartan 3/400 (XC3S400 = $6.50 @ 250k qty)
    $30 for 256MB DRAM
    $60 for Board, D/A, manufacturing, etc.

   $142 rough guesstimate hardware costs
   $158 for software/profit

    Yeah, that's probably the catch, because I'd want to use gvs (GNU
verilog/VHDL synthesis ;)

    Chip design isn't that much different than writing code.  Plus it
would be a great learning experience for anyone who hasn't tried a
hardware design language.  (Kinda like how learning lisp is an eye
opener for most people).  Besides, I think someone would eventually
port or create some interesting high level concurrent languages to use.
(I could see some interesting primitives added to a language like Erlang
or Oz to try to exploit the parallel nature of the FPGAs)

    It might not turn out to be a high profit margin business, but then
again, I don't think slapping together "white boxes" is high margin
either, but there doesn't seem to be a shortage of them.

    The hardest part would seem to be the software needed, i.e. a free
synthesizer/mapper.  But somehow we've managed to create an entire free
operating system.  I suppose it just takes time.  Maybe in another 5/10
years.  Or maybe we need to think of a better way to fund open hardware
projects.  If there were 25,000 of us who really wanted this project, we
could pay our $300 into an escrow account ($7.5E6 total).  When the
boards were delivered, the manufacturing company would get half the
money, and when version 1.0 of the software was completed, they'd get
the other half.  Surely a bank would loan money against that kind of
collateral.  But now I'm probably rambling.
