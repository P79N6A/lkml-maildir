Hello!
Oops!

No-no-no! I simply messed sk and skpair both there and in unix_shutdown
(fixed recently). Leave sock_orphan on its place, it orphans sk, not skpair.

Alas, not quite.
-	sock_orphan(sk);
It was OK.
-			sk->state_change(skpair);
Julian, I have already told you that sk->state_change cannot
be replaced with data_ready, it is true for error_report() as well.
Please, look at the function sock_def_wakeup() and compare it to another ones.
See?
Mama... I did even worse thing. Locking is broken! Bad, bad, bad.
sock_wake_async() was called without callback_lock.
And unix_shutdown is broken too...
Seems, this combination is correct.
	skpair->state_change(skpair);
	read_lock(&skpair->callback_lock);
	sock_wake_async(skpair->socket,0,POLL_HUP);
	read_lock(&skpair->callback_lock);
Note, that POLL_HUP translates to POLLHUP|POLLERR in any case.
(which looks very silly, we could write simply POLLHUP|POLLERR 8)8)
 I have no idea, why it is indirected via band_table).
Alexey
