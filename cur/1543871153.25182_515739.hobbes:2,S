Yes, I've already reported this.

What? How do you make the leap from lockdep output on boot to my experience of 
slow interactive response?

It doesn't, a one line fix from Ingo conflicts (and a comment that was changed).
7355690ead6d61f6344072ae61060f985060da29 [PATCH] sched: fix SMT scheduler bug
72fd4a35a824331d7a0f4168d7576502d95d34b3 [PATCH] Numerous fixes to kernel-doc info in source files.
I have reverted your patch and the laggy behaviour remains when running 
glxgears (in fact it seems a bit worse), I don't know about the thunderbird 
lag while typing since I can't easily reproduce it but I don't recall it ever 
happening before. So, your patch isn't the cause of a serious slowdown when 
running glxgears in the background (although it doesn't improve the situation 
much). It looks like it just slows down X in general rather than using much 
CPU.
