It breaks if you distribute them seperately. We have this problem in the way
the model works. It suprised me until I understood what is going on 
I claim:
Free software development is about minimising information exchange and knowledge
of external modules.
The practical upshot of this is we generate a fair amount of duplicated code.
Worse because of the 'minimising information exchange' aspect most developers
do not aggressively track the modules they initially took their skeleton code
from - thus we get bug replication.
One thing I have to do with many bug fixes is to grep the tree to see who
else copied the bug. That needs a single tree.
