Thanks for pointing that out. I thought, "packet sockets" means  
"datagram-oriented  socket". Obviously it means PF_PACKET instead. It's 
hard to learn programming IPC by only reading man pages :-)

Please correct me gently if I am wrong: According to the kernel source 
code, this behaviour was introduced with patch-2.6.8: 
http://www.kernel.org/diff/diffview.cgi?file=/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6.8.gz;z=4325
linux/net/ipv4/udp.c 
+
         err = copied;
+        if (flags & MSG_TRUNC)
+          err = skb->len - sizeof(struct udphdr);
I think local sockets (PF_UNIX) implement a different semantics: According 
to unix_dgram_recvmsg() in linux/net/unix/af_unix.c, in case of 
truncation the buffer size is returned and not the full packet length.
In my opinion this implementation of local sockets (PF_UNIX) is not 
following the wording of the man page man 2 recv: "These  calls  return  
the  number of bytes received". Am I getting something wrong here?
Why not improve consistency and make unix_dgram_recvmsg() return the full 
packet length? So it would behave as UDP does. What do you think about 
adding the following code to linux/net/unix/af_unix.c:
        err = size;
+        if (flags & MSG_TRUNC)
+                err = skb->len;
Cheers
Daniel
