Actually it is.  Dereferencing a null pointer is either undefined or
implementation-dependant in the standard (don't remember which), and
as such the compiler can do whatever it wants, be it starting nethack
or not doing the dereference in the first place.
The principle of least surprise makes doing such an "optimisation" not
so smart in practice.  A compiler capable of detecting that situation
would be better off spitting a warning in red blinking letter.
