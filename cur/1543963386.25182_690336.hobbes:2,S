Allowing huge pages in the page walker would affect both walk_pmd_range
and walk_pud_range. Then either the users of the page walker need to
know how to handle huge pages themselves (in the pmd_entry and pud_entry
callback functions), or the page walker treats huge pages as any other
pages (calling the pte_entry callback function).
