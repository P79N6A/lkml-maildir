My board is 2 years old (May 2003).
I've checked the specs [2] and they say (page 17 out of 83)
"APIC will be available in future steppings."  Yeah right...
Mine is stepping 1 according to /proc/cpuinfo.
So if I don't have APIC, that means I cannot use nmi_watchdog to
investigate the problem, right?
Do I have any alternative to investigate this hang or should I just
give up and smash my board?
Cheers,
Jerome
