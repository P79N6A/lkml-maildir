what I propose to do about it is to keep the old request_module() (as
Keith also says) and have a new request_modulef(). The rationale is - the
whole point of this is to eliminate the wasted CPU cycles of doing
sprintf() when CONFIG_KMOD is undefined and not have CONFIG_KMOD
everywhere. So, if I:
 a) figure out the macros with variable number of arguments
 and
 b) have both request_module() (for things like get_fs_type) and
    request_modulef() for anything that constructs module name from
    prefix and integer(s)
then it should be acceptable, right?
Tigran.
