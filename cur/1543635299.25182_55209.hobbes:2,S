{Sigh}
But the driverfs and USB code do _not_ show contention.  Or if they do
(as Dave pointed out in the driverfs code) it's in a non-critical
point in the kernel's life (boot time, USB device removal, etc.)

Yes, that's what I am asserting, _and_ that when my "corner" of the
kernel uses it, it doesn't really matter if ext3, ext2, or even the
entire VFS layer grinds to a halt.  No one will care, or even notice.

Wait!  You're still not getting it.  I'm not against removing the BKL.
I'm not saying we should add it to more places.  What I am complaining
about (and I'm not the only one) is the method that people who are
trying to remove the BKL from various kernel subsystems are using.  I
think Oliver said it best in this quote from this thread:
	So you do the greps and question locking usage on the
	right lists.  It's quite important, you might uncover
	bugs and speed up the kernel.  And you need to be
	persistent about it. Take your time to find out why
	the lock is used. Or why it makes no sense.
So please, no more "hit and run" BKL patches that break things.  Please
come offering to help, with detailed reasons why BKL usage is wrong in
the specific portions of the code, and how possibly it might be cleaned
up, with patches that have _actually been tested_.  And then
flames^Wdiscussions like this one will not happen at all.
thanks,
