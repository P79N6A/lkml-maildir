If you get this working nicely, it might even be a generally useful
thing. A set of perl scripts and easy interface commands could prove
popular. I would certainly find it convenient to have a patch
retransmission system that re-sent patches every time a new pre-patch
came out, and emailed me when the patch no longer applies. If it could
automatically de-queue when the patch is applied, or when I manually
remove it, that would be even better. And if I make an update to a
queued patch, it obsoletes the old one, that would be good too.
