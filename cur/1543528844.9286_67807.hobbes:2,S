Hmm.. That's probably a bug. It would probably be best to export the
original parent in the /proc setup, and make the "debugging parent"
possibly visible some way (but the original parent should be the normal
one).

Indeed. I think that illusion should be maintained, and really only
debugging should know about the so-called "real" parent.
The whole "re-parenting" thing was just a bad excuse for not re-doing the
parent pointers entirely, and should probably be ripped out at some point.
We should probably
 - get rid of "p_opptr"
 - make "p_pptr" always be the real parent (which is not to say the
   process that does "fork()" - "clone()" can just clone the real parent
   field too, obviously)
 - add a "p_debuggerptr" thing that is entirely new and ONLY used for
   debugging.
The reason for the re-parenting is obviously signal handling at exit time,
but that's just such a special case that it's not really worth the
confusion between "original parent" and "real parent". But it works, and
this is code that nobody really likes to touch because it is so
fundamental, so..
