For read, yes, and it's because something is going wrong with the
I/O size - it looks like readahead thrashing of some kind even
with 4k pages tests.
When when I bumped the block device readahead from 256 -> 2048,
the single disk read numbers went 60, 75, 75MB/s for 4->64k block size
and were repeatable, so we definitely have some interaction with readahead.

Filesystem blocksize, as specified by mkfs.xfs. Which, in turn,
changes the page cache order.

Increasing the filesystem block size also reduces the overhead of
the filesystem, not just he page cache. A lot of the overhead (write
especially) reductions are going to be filesystem block size
related, so I wouldn't start assuming that it's just he page cache
changes that have brought about these system time reductions.

Sure but that's a different problem to what we are trying to solve
now.  Even with this in place, I think we'd still realise
improvements with the compound pages....

Where did that come from? You spend 20 lines described the inefficiencies
of the readahead in the page cache and it should be fixed but then you
turn around and say fix the HBA? 
This test was constructed to keep the I/o sizes within the current
bounds, so the HBA sees no difference in I/O sizes as the filesystem
block size changes.  i.e. the HBA is constant factor during the
tests. IOWs, the changes in numbers above are purely a result of the
page cache and filesystem changes....
And besides, the "lameo HBA" I'm using is cleared limited by the
PCI-X bus it's on, not the size and type of pages being thrown at it
by the I/O layers. The hardware is pretty much irrelevant in these
tests....
Cheers,
Dave.
