[PATCH] i2c-i801.c: don't pci_disable_device() after it was just enabled
Commit 02dd7ae2892e5ceff111d032769c78d3377df970:
	[PATCH] i2c-i801: Merge setup function
has a missing return 0 in the _probe() function. this means the error
path is always executed and pci_disable_device() is called even when
the device just got successfully enabled.
having the SMBus device disabled makes some systems (eg. Fujitsu-Siemens
Lifebook E8010) hang hard during power-off.
Intead of reverting the whole commit this patch fixes it up:
- don't ever call pci_disable_device(), also not in the _remove() function
  to avoid hangs
- fix missing pci_release_region() in error path
