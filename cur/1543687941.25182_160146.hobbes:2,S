I don't think that's going to work well when you have more conventional
devices below a platform device which need to be power managed (eg, a
USB host.)
I think we need to expand the platform device support to include the
notion of platform drivers.  For example:
	struct platform_driver {
		int (*probe)(struct platform_device *);
		int (*remove)(struct platform_device *);
		int (*suspend)(struct platform_device *, u32);
		int (*resume)(struct platform_device *);
		struct device_driver drv;
	};
(Aside: I like the movement of the suspend/resume methods to the bus_type,
and I'd like to see the probe/remove methods also move there.  For the
vast majority of cases, the probe/remove methods in struct device_driver
end up pointing at the same functions for any particular bus.)

I know it works on ARM, but, since APM is completely fscked in 2.6
kernels and no one seems to be interested in the issue, its something
I can't test on x86.

Bear in mind that Red Hat kernels contain a generic PCI bridge driver
in order to save its state across suspend/resume, and that the PPC
people also seem to need it.  Also bear in mind that the Mobility Docks
have some non-standard configuration controls in their PCI-PCI bridge
which needs a vendor specific PCI-PCI bridge driver.
