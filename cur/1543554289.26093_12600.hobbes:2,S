So what? Get enough spool space in /var/spool/mqueue and a platform
with 64 bit file support and it works just fine. I have some boxes
where the users send 100+ MByte mails on a regular base. Once you beat
the procmail into submission, this simply works.
sendmail is one of the very best pieces of free multi-platform
software that is available. I really admire the people that wrote
it. Kudos to everyone that wrote on this software. All hail Eric
Allman. ;-)
It is mean, tough, hard to understand and configure but definitely
industrial strength, proven and reliable. Something you can't say of
all this sissy "free" software around today.
And once you get a hang of "left side, right side" rules, you can read
sendmail.cf like normal text. The idea of using an algorithmic concept
for a config file still shines after twenty years of development. So
much for "GUIs".
