Subject: [PATCH] tty non-blocking read bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/3/27/95

There is a problem with 2.2.x that makes non-blocking tty reads block.
This happens when you have multiple readers and there is already a
blocking read in progress.  The "non-blocking" read blocks until the
blocking read is finished, which is illustrated by the attached C
program.  Also attached is a patch that solves the problem.  The patch
is against 2.2.4.  The bug was introduced in 2.2.0-pre6.
Before applying the patch, the output is
    Blocking read...
    Non-blocking read...
and nothing more.  After applying the patch, the output is
    Blocking read...
    Non-blocking read...
    Non-blocking read: Resource temporarily unavailable
    Non-blocking read done.
as it should be.
