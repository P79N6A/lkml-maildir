Hello developers,
I installed the 2.3.49 today and set up the kernel to use the
framebuffer-device of my TNT-Chipset (Elsa Erazor II) on the console.
It works and I also can use fbset to change to higher refresh rates of my
monitor.
But the colors of all displayed stuff are very dark (I only can read it if
the monitor is set with VERY high brightness...).
The darkness starts already at bootup, when loading and tux is shown at
screen...
If I then start and end dosemu - wich resets the graphics-environment, all
looks ok in every resolution...
Any hints?  
Thanks, Matthias
