Thanks a lot for testing this!

Hm, this should be 'disk' ...

I think that your results reflect the code pretty well, ie. no big surprises.
On ACPI machines suspend doesn't actually work without ACPI and that's why
'mem' is missing from kernel/power/state with E).  Hibernation theoretically
works without ACPI, but the box cannot be powered off due to the lack of
support for that.
For the same reason, the system doesn't power off with E), F).
The errors from device drivers in the last phase of hibernation with E) may be
related to some confusion cause by the lack of ACPI methods expected to be
present.

Rafael
