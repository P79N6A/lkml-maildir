Actually, I think we can set a per-cpu "in_guest" flag for the scheduler
code, which then knows to add the tick to the guest time.  That seems
the simplest possible solution.
lguest or kvm would set the flag before running the guest (which is done
with preempt disabled or using preemption hooks), and reset it
afterwards.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
