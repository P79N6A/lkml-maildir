APIC is not in the kernel
I put 
  __asm__("int $0x2f");
before calibrate_delay and inside as well for testing.
spurious 8259A int15 was reported  and up to 18000 counted in 
/proc/interrupts, but no hang ;-) 
I suppose have to settle for hardware/BIOS (IRQ misrouted/8259 
init problem or timer not working) as the cause for the hang
