How about something like this?
The alternative is to just remove that size check entirely, and depend on 
get_user_pages() doing the stack limit check (among all the *other* checks 
it does when it does the acct_stack_growth() thing).
I'd almost prefer that simpler approach, but I don't have any really 
strong preferences. Anybody?
