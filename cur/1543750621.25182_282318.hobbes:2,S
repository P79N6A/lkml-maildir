it's a win on more than older HT cpus. It's just that those suffer it
the most... (since there you have 2 "cpus" share the cache, meaning you
get double the aliasing)

one of the problem cases I remember is network daemons all waiting in
accept() for connections. All from the same codepath basically.
Randomizing the stackpointer is a gain for that on all cpus that have
finite affinity on their caches.

The reason my patch does it much more is that it makes it a step harder
to write exploits for stack buffer overflows.
