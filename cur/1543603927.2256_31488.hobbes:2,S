Low latency wobviously won't do damage by itself.  But Andrew Morton
said it well: "And maintaining that performance
with either approach is a fair bit of work and impacts (by definition)
the whole kernel."
I.e. it is too much work to get right (and keep right).  The amount
of developers is finite, their time can be better spent on other
improvements.  All future improvement will be harder if we also have
to _maintain_ extreme low latency.  This is not fix-it-once thing.
