I am using NFS to share /usr and /home with reiserFS on three dual Athlon
1500XP, and they have 1 month of uptime and no problems till now.
I am using kernel 2.4.13+mosix. I am also using a 2.4.17 NFS server with
reiserFS on a k6-II 475Mhz, for slackware installation with NFS, and no
problem also there. It happens that I have also very high IO on NFS, so I
think I can say it works.
