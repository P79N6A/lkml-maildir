Just a question -- will there be a performance 
issue with mounting and unmounting lots of very 
little filesystems (every file with EAs/streams?
And, how transparent will it be? Will the user
have to "mount muckety-muck myfile" to use its
streams?
That would make things "intereting." Like
netatalk+hfs...
