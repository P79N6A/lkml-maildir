I still think the submitter should plug before they start a set of
requests (the submitter currently does not plug, the queue does when
it empties), and unplug when it has finished submission (not when a
process next waits, because that is suboptimal for asynch IO).
When you do this, the plug/unplug should become simple like locks too.
You're really keen on unplugging at the point of waiting. I don't get
it.

OK.

Yeah the concept isn't bad. I think the queue based implementation, and
unplug at wait time isn't great.

It may be a good concept but if it doesn't help, then removing it is a good
idea too ;) Now I've been told it does help, so instead of removing it I
suggest changing it. Just exploring ideas.
