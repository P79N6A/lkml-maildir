That's an update when we move leftwards.

&se->run_node is already in the cache, we are assigning cfs_rq->rb_rightmost to it.

sched_yield() is supported API and also look at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/19/351.
 I am trying to make sched_yield() efficient
when compat_sched_yield is turned on (which is most likely), since people will
want that behaviour (Hint, please read the man-page for sched_yield).There are
already several applications using sched_yield(), so they all suffer.

I have measured how much time can be saved by not doing that and it's quite a lot.
