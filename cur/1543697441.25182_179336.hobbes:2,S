The correct value for the bufctl would be 0xfffffffe - a single bit is 
wrong, but OTHO 0xffffffff is also a valid value.
Two different caches are affected.
The addresses of the corrupted variable differ, the offset into the page 
is identical. I think that rules out bad memory. That leaves a bug in 
slab.c, a bad bit in the L1/L2 cache, or random pointer scribbling.
Jerome, could you try the attached patch? It changes the magic constants 
that are used by slab.c. And please pay attention to the objnr: Is it 
always objnr 10, slabp xxxxx000, or do you see other values as well?
