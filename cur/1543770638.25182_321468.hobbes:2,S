Hi Jens,
thanks for the short info now my next question how many queue depths
are healty and wanted?
For my Intel Corporation 82801GR/GH (ICH7 Family) Serial ATA Storage
Controllers cc=AHCI (rev 01)
and Samsung Hd160JJ SATAII drive the default queue is 30
    ioGL64NX_MACH~# cat /sys/block/sda/device/{model,queue_depth}
    SAMSUNG HD160JJ
    30
    hdparm -Tt /dev/sda
    /dev/sda:
    Timing cached reads: 4724 MB in 2.00 seconds = 2360.00 MB/sec
    Timing buffered disk reads: 164 MB in 3.02 seconds = 54.28 MB/sec
On random access the drives is a bit noisy but the subjective feeling is
great
everything goes a bit faster.
And whats about the option /sys/block/sdx/device/queue_type = simple
what can be done here?
Thanks in advance
Best regards
Michael
