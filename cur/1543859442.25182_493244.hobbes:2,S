All the interrupt handler does is schedule tasklets and they are all handled 
before returning to userspace.  So not matter how you order them it's going to 
take the same time.  If you want to defer handling of async traffic to after 
your userspace handler has run, you need to schedule a work_struct for 
handling the async events.
Having said that, I doubt that the latency between iso interrupt and user 
space handler imposed by the irq handler and the tasklets will be a problem. 
All the async tasklets do is copy the data out of the DMA buffers, possibly 
lookup a corresponding request and eventually call complete() on some struct 
completion.  The worst case is the bus reset tasklet which does the topology 
walk, but even that is pretty fast.

Sounds great, I'll get to the isochronous receive feature as soon as possible. 
  I'm open to changing the interrupt handling if we can acheive lower latency, 
but we need to be able to measure it before we start making changes.
cheers,
