Would it make sense to add a "dump_stack()" and to print out the name of 
the binary that causes this too? Ie add something like
	printk("dumping stack for %s:\n", current->comm);
	dump_stack();
to the bd_claim() debugging thing...
It will fill the logs, but I don't think it happens often enough to be a 
bother...
