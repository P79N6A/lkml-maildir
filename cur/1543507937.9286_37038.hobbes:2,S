Ok, I can see that, but it doesn't seem to be done in abundance.
Wouldn't it be clearer if request_irq() took a function pointer
to be used to determine whether the interrupt belongs to the
driver or not? i.e.:
if (request_irq(irq, intr, SA_SHIRQ, "foo", foodev, isfoointr) { ... }
static int isfoointr(int irq, void *foodev, struct pt_regs *regs) {
	if (foodev && inw(FOOIO))
		return 1; /* foo device generated this interrupt */
	else
		return 0; /* not my interrupt */
}
At least it would force driver writers to address the shared interrupt
issue, and if the kernel determines that nobody claims the interrupt
it could do something about it, like complain, which it can't do at
the moment. Something that has caused me endless problems on a laptop
with some unidentifiable PCI device generating unhandled interrupts.
