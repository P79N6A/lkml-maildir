Just a small example,
	debug_smp_processor_id:
		/*
		 * Kernel threads bound to a single CPU can safely use
		 * smp_processor_id():
		 */
		this_mask = cpumask_of_cpu(this_cpu);
		if (cpus_equal(current->cpus_allowed, this_mask))
			goto out;
This is not true with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU. This becomes true if we freeze
the kernel threads from CPU_DOWN_PREPARE to CPU_DEAD.
