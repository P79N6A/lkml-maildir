And points out that $SUBJECT is misleading; the root cause of
the oops isn't rtc_cmos.  Workaround, don't enable the legacy
driver for this hardware.

I think the RTC core shouldn't emit this message; I'll send
a patch.  It's just confusing on error paths; and on success
paths it's less informative than a message from the driver
itself could be.
One of the good things about getting rtc-cmos merged:  it
exposes this new RTC framework to new mistakes, which helps
fix some of the remaining rough spots.

Blame the PNP stack for that particular useless message.
I'l send a fix for that one too.
> rtc_cmos: probe of 00:03 failed with error -16
That's the first message that makes any sense to emit!
In this case, "-16" ("-EBUSY") means that a resource
was in use by the legacy RTC driver.

Because probing 00:03 failed, was never fully usable.
So then rtc0 couldn't be found.  You'd get the same
message if, say, the RTC was loaded as a module.

You enabled CONFIG_RTC (under char drivers, "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support")
so that driver has claimed the CMOS RTC instead of "rtc-cmos.c".  Disable it.
Then you'll be able to use this driver with no little surprises.
It's odd the way that code registered the RTC before grabbing the resources
it would use.  Normally I wouldn't code it like that.  I think that probably
had to do with wanting to make sure resources got associated with "rtc0"
(or whatever) rather than some generic name.  Obviously that can only happen
if the RTC was registered (and thus named) before claiming resources.
