Hi,
In 2.5.56 I'm seeing a bug in "make menuconfig" on x86: selecting "processor
type and features", then "processor family", and then "help" for any entry,
I always get "There is no help available for this kernel option." even
though there are extensive help texts in arch/i386/Kconfig.
BTW, just noticed that same is true for:
x86 - processor type and features - subarch
x86 - processor type and features - highmem
x86 - Bus options - PCI access mode 
...
maybe a bug for the "choice" entry?
