This is a religion the kernel doesn't follow. Its a pointless

Yes its a co-ordination issue. If the IDE disk writes to the bus the
same moment as the IDE CD shit also happens.

Gosh, just like if the IDE disk driver changes the bus clocking during
an IDE CD transfer.
You need co-ordination not some horrible glue it all together and pray
hack. Thats always going to be true, and since you can do it without
glueing it all together you might get somewhere by keeping them apart,
otherwise I see no future. Most DRI users don't want FB, most FB users
don't care about DRI or want to control the DRI from the fb side.
