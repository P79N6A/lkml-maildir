Not really...  These macros are usually used for things like scheduling, 
memory placement and other decisions.  Right now the value doesn't have 
to be error-checked, because it is assumed to always return a valid 
node.  For these types of uses, it's far better to schedule/allocate 
something on the wrong node (ie: node 0) than on an invalid node (ie: 
node -1).  Having a possible negative value for this will break things 
when used as an array index (as it often is), and will force us to put 
tests to ensure it is a valid value before using it, and introduce 
possible races in the future (ie: imagine testing if CPU 17's node 
mapping is non-negative, simultaneously unmapping the CPU, then using 
the macro again to make a node decision.  You may get a negative value 
back, thus causing you to index way off the end of your array... BOOM). 
  If we stick with the convention that we always have a valid (even if 
not *correct*) value in these arrays, the worst we should get is poor 
performance, not breakage.
Cheers!
