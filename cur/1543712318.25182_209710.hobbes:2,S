Well, -ffast-math sets -funsafe-math-optimizations, unless you do
-ffast-math -fno-unsafe-math-optimizations, so the difference is not that
big.  glibc math inlines will be eventually replaced by GCC builtins as soon
as GCC is known to optimize at least as good as glibc's math inlines and so
even that difference will cease to exist.
