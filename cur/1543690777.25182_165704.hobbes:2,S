That's because it _is_ faster. It contains no silly memory allocations
for the buffer and data copying in the kernel, the data is mapped from
the user buffer and DMA'ed directly from there. It also uses DMA where
ide-scsi wont.
People generally report that they have no problems burning at full speed
(52) on even really old machines where ide-scsi maxed out long before.
