I had been running 2.2.9 for several weeks with no problem.  I had not yet
compiled quota support into the kernel, so I decided that I would go ahead
and move to 2.2.11 while I was at it.
The box stays up for about 2 days and then I get a massive memory failure.  
Everything runs out of memory.  All services are unavailable, console
login is impossible, even mingetty stops responding, the machine grinds to
a halt.  Hard reset is the only way out.  =(  I've had this problem twice
now with 2.2.11.  Up for two days, then runs out of memory, hard reset.
I've now dropped down to 2.2.10.  It has not yet hit the 2 day mark, so I
do not know if I will have the same problem with 2.2.10.
I would go through the patch from 2.2.9 -> 2.2.10 -> 2.2.11 and look
myself, but I'm no kernel developer and I haven't the time to go read
through millions of lines of code.  =)  Might as well leave it to the
experts, huh?  ;)
The machine is a dual pII-350 with 384MB RAM.  If anyone wants my .config
or any other information on the box itself, just ask.
Thanks,
Mike
