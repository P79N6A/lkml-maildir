Yes, we did fix it ;)
Quite a long time ago, so maybe you are thinking of something else
(I haven't been able to work it out).
AS basically does its own TCQ strangulation, which IIRC involves things
like completing all reads before issuing new writes, and completing all
reads from one process before reads from another. As well as the
fundamental way that waiting for a 'dependant read' throttles TCQ.

Well it depends on what we want to do. If we hard limit the AS queue
like this, I can remove some of that TCQ throttling logic from AS.
OTOH, the throttling was intended to allow us to sanely use a large
TCQ depth without getting really bad behaviour. Theoretically a process
can make use of TCQ if it is doing a lot of writing, or if it is not
determined to be doing dependant reads.
