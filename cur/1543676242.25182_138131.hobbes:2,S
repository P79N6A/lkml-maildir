The "device node"? You mean stuff in /proc, right?

No. You explained why not:

The existing per-arch code looks like it would work.
At worst, an offset (probably already a #define somewhere)
might need to be added.
Pushing a MAP_MMIO through to the per-arch code
might be slightly more involved. I can do PowerPC
and x86 at least, if it comes to that.
