Ouch. HOW THE HELL DID THAT NOT GET INLINED?
cmpxchg() is a _single_ instruction if it's inlined, but it's a horrible 
mess of dynamic conditionals on the (constant - per call-site) size 
argument if it isn't.
It looks like you probably enabled the "let gcc mess up inlining" config 
option.
Ingo - I think we need to remove that crap again. Because gcc gets the 
inlining horribly horribly wrong. As usual.
