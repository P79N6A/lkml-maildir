If it takes 1 second to spin down to a stop, the it probably will
have slowed to a point where serialization writing a sector cannot
be kept in sync within 1 to 5 milliseconds.  Once they _start_
slowing down, time is an extremely precious resource.  That data
pattern has to be read back at full speed.

By the time the seek completes, the speed is probably too slow to do a
good write.  Options to deal with this include special handling for the
emergency track to allow reading it back by intentionally slowing down
the drive for that recovery.  Another option is flash disk.
The apparent problem in the IBM DTLA is the write didn't have enough
time to complete with the platter still spinning within spec.  That
means the sector gets compressed at the end and the bit density is
increased beyond readable levels (if it could go higher reliably, they
would just record everything that way).  That and the end of the sector
doesn't fall off into the gap between sectors where there is probably
some low level stuff.  So on readback, some bits are in error due to
the clocking rate rising due to the compression, and the trailing edge
hits the previous sector occupant's un-erased end before the gap.
