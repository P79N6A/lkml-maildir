That's because it's not all bad (or the problems are minor and can wait 
until later).

To my mind, scheduling and load balancing are ALMOST orthogonal 
concepts.  Scheduling is concerned with doing a useful job within a 
single CPU and load balancing is about distributing tasks/load among the 
available CPUs.  To a large extent these are independent and are being 
worked on separately.  I am one of those fiddling with the schedulers 
but I'm leaving load balancing alone as it seems to me that the NUMA and 
hyper threading developers are the main players for that component.
To my mind the only contribution the scheduler component MAY want to 
make to load balancing would be to have some say in which tasks are 
chosen for migration.  I don't think that any of the currently proposed 
schedulers have a strong need to change the current mechanism(s) for 
selecting which tasks get migrated.  If you think otherwise please share 
your thoughts?

The main reason is that the standard scheduler is a bit of a mess. The 
fact that the code is self contained just makes it easier to modify 
without touching lots of files. It's not the reason why the changes are 
being tried.
