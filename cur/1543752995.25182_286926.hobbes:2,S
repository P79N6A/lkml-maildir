Some interference is definitely possible.  But, the test does not
involve any graphical interface, so I'd expect that to be small.
Looking at jack_test3_client.cpp, the main thread just does a sleep()
while the process cycle is running.
Still, it's hard to be sure.  
Probably, the best way to tell would be patching JACK so it uses
nice(-20) instead of pthread_setschedparam() for the realtime threads.
As a hack, that looks easy.  I'll build a working directory with just
that change, so we can experiment with it better.
