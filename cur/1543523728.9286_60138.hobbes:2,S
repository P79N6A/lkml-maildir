It's nice that switching times under large RQ loads is improved, when
there is no cache issue.
But it's not important.  It's not relevant.
Real world problems do not have that kind of load.  Real world problems
_do_ have cache issues.
The cache issue is so important for real applications that optimising
the scheduler under unusual RQ loads isn't worth doing.
At least, I believe that is the view being presented by Larry McVoy.
have a nice day,
