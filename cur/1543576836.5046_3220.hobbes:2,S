Ok - my point was (and maybe I'm just misunderstanding something):
Multiple threads do send() etc. -> this gets serialized by the kernel
anyway, as TCP checksums are done in the kernel as well as the NIC
driving etc.   If the TCP layer cannot parallelize checksum calculation.
One thread does many send()'s  -> this also gets serialized by the
kernel.
Or:  one thread vs. many threads reading from the disk -> makes no difference
since there is *one* buffer layer, one driver, one disk etc. etc.
My question is:   Does it change anything in the way the TCP stack
can crank out packets, if I change the number of threads in user-space
making the system calls ?
Does the fine-grained locking allow multiple user-space threads to
actually have TCP checksums etc. done on multiple CPUs concurrently,
and is it true that this will not happen if I have one user-space
thread doing non-blocking send() calls ?
Thanks,
