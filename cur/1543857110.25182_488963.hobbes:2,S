But then its also just requires disable/enable interrupts on UP which may 
be cheaper than an atomic operation.

Because it locks the bus? I am not that familiar with those architectures 
but it seems that those will have a general problem anyways.

And thereby denying the kernel developers to use a simple atomic SMP 
operation? Adding additional defines for each arch and each performance 
critical piece of kernel logic?
