oops.  Better fix the route cache too.
I'm not sure what went wrong in there, sorry for letting that slip through.
Obviously, doing
	if (a)
		foo = bar;
	else
		foo = zot;
	if (b)
		foo = rab;
	else
		foo = toz;
does not make a ton of sense.
This should fix it up.  We keep the table sizing identical to that which
we had in 2.6.earlier, with a boot option override.
