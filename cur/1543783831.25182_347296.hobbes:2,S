We're using our dlm quite a bit in user space and require the full dlm
API.  It's difficult to export the full API through a pseudo fs like
dlmfs, so we've not found it a very practical approach.  That said, it's a
nice idea and I'd be happy if someone could map a more complete dlm API
onto it.
We export our full dlm API through read/write/poll on a misc device.  All
user space apps use the dlm through a library as you'd expect.  The
library communicates with the dlm_device kernel module through
read/write/poll and the dlm_device module talks with the actual dlm:
linux/drivers/dlm/device.c  If there's a better way to do this, via a
pseudo fs or not, we'd be pleased to try it.
