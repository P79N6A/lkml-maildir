Subject: [PATCH 44/44] KVM: MMU: optimize set_spte for page sync
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Marcelo Tosatti <mtosatti@redhat.com>
The write protect verification in set_spte is unnecessary for page sync.
Its guaranteed that, if the unsync spte was writable, the target page
does not have a write protected shadow (if it had, the spte would have
been write protected under mmu_lock by rmap_write_protect before).
Same reasoning applies to mark_page_dirty: the gfn has been marked as
dirty via the pagefault path.
The cost of hash table and memslot lookups are quite significant if the
workload is pagetable write intensive resulting in increased mmu_lock
contention.
