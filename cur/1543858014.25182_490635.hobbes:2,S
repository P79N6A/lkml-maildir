Ok, that's just strange. 
I think it's fine to do init_pcmcia_bus early to make sure that the PCMCIA 
bus interface is there by the time the driver init stuff happens, but I 
really don't see the point of that firmware load to be there. And all that 
MATCH_FAKE_CIS stuff is about the _devices_, not the PCMCIA bus, so that 
whole thing looks pretty silly. It should be done by the device 
registration (which is obviously device_initcall), not by some bus layer.
Hopefully Dominik can fix whatever up (if it even needs it)
