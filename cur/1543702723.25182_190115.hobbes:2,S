Hi Gunter,
I have some additions to the last patch and I'd like you to give it a spin.
Also, could you please define DEBUG symbol in drivers/input/serio/i8042.c
and send me your dmesg with boot data and also when the touchpad loses
sync. I'd like to see it in all gory details :)
Thank you,
Dmitry

ChangeSet@1.1514, 2004-01-10 23:50:51-05:00, dtor_core@ameritech.net
  Input: Change the way timeouts/parity errors are handled:
         - Only complain about errors from keyboard controller if mouse
           is activated
         - Reset packet count to 0 as the next received byte will most
           likely be the first byte of a new packet
         - If expecting an ACK from the mouse set NACK condition
