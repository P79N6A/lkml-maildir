No more /proc cruft, please!
How on earth is the kernel to know what it needs (modulewise), as this
depends on the exact setup for the user?
What if modules export/import symbols that just serve for dependencies?
This is cleaner IMVHO, and a distributed solution (no single file that
builds the above /proc stuff that has to be kept up to date, even for
third-party modules)
