You mean halt's alternate "shutdown vcpu" meaning if you call it with
interrupts disabled?  Yeah, I'd be happy to have an explicit op for
that, rather than making it a secondary overloaded meaning.  And use
"safe_halt" for all uses of "wait for next interrupt".

You mean have separate lazy_mmu and lazy_cpu (lazy_context_switch) ops? 
Possible, but they're still exclusive.  (I think VMI, at least, assumes
that you can't have lazy_mmu and lazy_cpu active at the same time, and
its nice to enforce this in the interface.)
But having a whole misc structure for this interface is pretty warty, I
admit.
