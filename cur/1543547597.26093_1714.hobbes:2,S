   I can only assume the reason for this is one of control, and that
   there are no valid technical reasons for it.  I have spent more
   nights with printk() than I care to.
And I bet the lessons learned and the issues involved in those nights
with printk will never leave your brain, you will remember precisely
in the future next time you see the same types of symptoms what kinds
of things to look for and where.
This is what a debugger does not do for you.  The debugger allows you
to be lazy, step around, "oh yeah check for NULL" and never have to
_think_ about what you're doing or the changes you're making or even
if the same bug might be elsewhere.
This is why Linus does not allow a debugging facility like this into
the kernel, so people spend time _thinking_ when they go hunting down
bugs.
It takes longer to nail a bug, yes, but the resulting fix is always
far superior.  And the person who discovers the bug leaves with a much
larger amount of knowledge about how that area of the kernel works.
Later,
