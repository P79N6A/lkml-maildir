I have a doubt regarding wait_event.
In the macro __wait_event, the calling process changes its state to
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and calls schedule.
And does this in infinite loop.
After the loop, it itself changes its state to TASK_RUNNING.
Once it calls schedule(), the scheduler will remove it from task list as
it is in uninterruptible mode.
Then when does it come again into running state to check the condition.
kindly cc the reply to me as i'm not subscribed to the list
