LOL...I got a bit scatterbrained.  My basic argument is the fewer context
switches while maintaining interactivity the better because it's less
overhead and less cache thrashing.  If we don't care about the overhead and
thrashing at all, then might as well be very aggressive with the scheduler
and use uniform 1 ms timeslices in a RR fashion.  I've coded such a
scheduler in an embedded systems context; response time is awesome, but I
highly doubt it'd work for Linux workloads.

I just started monitoring the list and I'm still quite a bit behind, so I'm
playing catch up on reading whenever I have a bit of free time.  I'll look
for your patch and check out your code.
