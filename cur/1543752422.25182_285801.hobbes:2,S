I agree, and in most of these cases long delay are due to things
falling through cracks or not getting adequate cycles.  Not so much
politics.

That's more or less my take.  Timely response to reporter, timely
debugging/bug fixing and timely disclosure.

What about the reverse, and informing vendors?  This is typical...project
security contact gets report, figures out bug, works with vendor-sec on
release date.  In my experience, the long cycles rarely come from that
final negotiation.  It's usually not much of a negotiation, rather a
"heads-up", "thanks".
The two goals: 1) timely response, fix, dislosure; and 2) not leaving
vendors with pants down; don't have to be mutually exclusive.
thanks,
