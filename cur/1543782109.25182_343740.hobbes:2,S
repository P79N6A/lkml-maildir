It sounds as if you would be a great choice as new smbfs maintainer - 
you know both the protocols involved and the Linux kernel.
Noone expects big feature additions to the smbfs code, maintainership 
consists of:
- reviewing patches
- handling bugs (the 16 open bugs in the kernel Bugzilla give a rough
  impression of what problems people face)
cifs might be the future, but until it supports a superset of smbfs
users require smbfs - and a good smbfs makes their life easier.
