We discussed this with Keith Packard, who insisted that video switching
is best done from within the video driver using native hardware interfaces.
That sounds good to me, but it doesn't answer the question about
systems who choose to export video switching via ACPI.
The goal at hand is to export that capability in the event
it is not available via other means.
The issue that will come up is if this capability and a native
hardware technique are used at the same time -- probably
bad things will happen.  In that case, we need a way for
the native technique to disable use of the ACPI technique.
