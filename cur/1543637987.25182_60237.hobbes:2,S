That's strange! I'm using a C1MGP, german version.
See 
http://www.kuix.de/sonyc1/lspci
 for lspci output.
However, if you apply the patch below, and you have to manually set it 
to vsync low, I guess this means your on boot mode was set to high, 
which is what is requested in modedb.c, and it sounds like the patch 
below is correct. But we probably need more entries in modedb.c to 
support all models of the C1M.
