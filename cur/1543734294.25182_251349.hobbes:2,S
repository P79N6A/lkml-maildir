Umm thats what happened to ruby and thats what happened to KGI.

I'll try and debug the vga generic (Linus "stupid" driver as he calls
it). That'll provide the framework to plug the other bits in. That needs
doing anyway to get hotplugging and all the other sane stuff right (oh
and probably sysfs but someone else can do that).
I was using much simpler lock ideas than Linus but I'll have a poke at
that too, something more like a dri lock that knows who had it last.
