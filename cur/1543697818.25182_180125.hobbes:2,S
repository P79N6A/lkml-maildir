Greetings everybody, scsi folks in particular;
I don't know if I've got a bad, miss-set link thats effecting the 
build of amanda, or ???
Preconditions:
tape drive has magazine, magazine ejected and reloaded, but all tapes 
still reside in the magazine carrier.
Under a 2.4.22-pre10 boot, a run of amcheck will load the last loaded 
slot of the magazine and proceed to search the magazine for the next, 
correct tape.
Under a 2.6.0test9 or 10 boot, it loads a tape, but then gets a signal 
11 and exits.  A re-run from that point, where it does have a loaded 
tape from the first run, proceeds 100% normally in searching the 
magazine.
Preset the magazine again and run it with gdb, and get this only if 
booted to a 2.6 kernel:

(gdb) quit
The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y
Additional data:  /usr/src/linux-2.6 points at the 2.6.0-test10 src 
tree, but /usr/src/linux points at the 2.4.22-pre10 src tree.  I have 
NDI if this has any effects, good or bad, on the configure and build 
of amanda, which is itself the latest 2.4.4p1 snapshot dated 
20031120.
And ANAICT, nothing else amanda related is effected.  Bug, feature, 
miss-configuration?  Hints?
