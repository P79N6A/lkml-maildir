Please reproduce the error without the nvidia driver loaded, or report
the problem to the nvidia developers.  Unfortunately it is impossible
to say what the source of the problem is, as it is possible the nvidia
driver is overwriting memory elsewhere in the kernel and there is no
way for anyone to check that.
Cheers, Andreas
