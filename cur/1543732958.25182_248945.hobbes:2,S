Yes.  md_flush_mddev should simply be removed.  
The functionality should be, and largely is, in the individual
personalities. 
Is there documentation somewhere on exactly what an issue_flush_fn
should do (is it  allowed to sleep? what must happen before it is
allowed to return, what is the "error_sector" for,  that sort of thing).
I suspect that at least raid5 will need some fairly special handling.
