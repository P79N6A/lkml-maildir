That's debatable.  Arguably, a failed ->module_cleanup() should be
retried on every rmmod -a, but expecting module.c to just keep
retrying mindlessly on its own sounds too much like a busy wait.

Suppose the module exit relies on synchronize_kernel.  The attacker
can force repeated synchronize_kernels, knowing that module.c will
mindlessly do a synchronize_kernel every time a module init fails,
whether needed or not.  Each synchronize_kernel takes an unbounded
amount of time to complete, across which module.c holds a lock.

Sure, you can fix it by lathering on more complexity.  What you have
to do is explain why we should do that, when there is a simpler and
faster approach that doesn't introduce the problem in the first
place.

That is sloppy.  Different discussion.
I take it that the points you didn't reply to are points that you
agree with?  (The main point being, that we both advocate a simple,
two-method interface for module load/unload.)
