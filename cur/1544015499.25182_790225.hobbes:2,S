I was wanting to stick with drivers to start with, but I really have no
objection to adding filesystems, if they are self-contained, to the
drivers/staging/ directory.
I looked at adding squashfs, but at the time, it touched other portions
of the kernel which wouldn't have made it a good canidate for staging.
This was later resolved, and now that it is merged, it's a moot issue :)
So, if anyone wants to send me filesystems, I'll be glad to take them
into drivers/staging, as long as they are self-contained (novfs for
example would fit this category.)
thanks,
