You are missing some history... I posted such a patch in 2002:

ISTR willy or Ivan recently posted a patch that was suggested in 2002
as well (don't disable MMIO on bridge devices when sizing BARs)...so the
main objections might be resolved to this "obvious fix". *sigh*

Thanks for posting the traces...it's past midnight here and I'll try to
look at those tomorrow. (Sorry - sounds like a lame excuse but I'm likely
to read the trace incorrectly at the moment.)
