This may be my fault.  I made changes in the SMH code as part of the 
ZAPHOD patch but was unable to test them on a hyperthreaded machine due 
to a lack thereof (I have one on order).  I've attached a patch that 
reverts the changes that I made.  Can you give them a try please and let 
me know if they fix your problem?
Thanks
Peter
