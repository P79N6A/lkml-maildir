Let me explain a little about the patch, and then I am interested in if
your opinion changes.
When unlock_kernel() is called, the preemption code will be enabled and
check if the preemption count is non-zero -- its handled just like a
recursive lock.  If there are other locks held, preemption won't
happen.  Thus, we return to the caller code patch and lock_kernel() is
called and everyone is happy.
If unlock_kernel() is called, and the preemption code (which hangs off
the bottom of the locking code) sees that the lock depth is now 0, it
will call preempt_schedule (if needed) and allow a new process to run.
Then we return to the original code patch, call lock_kernel, and
continue.
Or am I missing something?
