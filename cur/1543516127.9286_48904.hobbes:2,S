Funny, I can't find that warning ;) However, I can find this:
   Note that the latest compilers (egcs, pgcc, gcc 2.8) may do Bad Things
   while compiling your kernel, particularly if absurd optimizations (like
   -O9) are used.  Caveat emptor.  Currently, the only
This is obviously very old (both egcs and gcc-2.8 are no longer the
"latest" versions). Now that many problems were resolved and the kernel
(at least 2.3) auto-detects wether (p)gcc-2.95 is used, is this warning
still valid?
In effect this warning says: "use gcc-2.7.2 or do not complain".
