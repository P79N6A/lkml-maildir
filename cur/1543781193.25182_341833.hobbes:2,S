Hi,
	I got problems trying to use ABNT2 USB keyboards with the
"." key in numeric keypad. The problem only appears in USB
keyboards (not in PS/2) and in 2.4 series (not in 2.6).
	The solution is very simple, and only need to change one line
and add other in pc_keyb.c. And, in my tests, don't affect any other
keyboards.
						Thanks a lot,
