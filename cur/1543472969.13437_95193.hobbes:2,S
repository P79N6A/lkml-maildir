Yep, and while CISC machines have these elegant LOCK+INCmem instructions,
RISC systems tend to have:  MEM->REG loads, REG->REG operations, REG->MEM
stores.  Specifically, they do *not* have MEM->MEM operations!
In case of Alpha, the code is:
        1:     ldl_l tempreg,memaddrreg		; Load Long Locked
               addl tempreg,valuereg,tempreg	; Add to loaded value
               stl_c tempreg,memaddrreg		; Store Long CondLock
			; This is the real jevel at Alpha, hardware
			; assists multi-processor coherence by monitoring
			; previous "load defined" lock address events
			; in the external bus.  If a write happens
			; at the given address, then 'tempreg' will
			; be cleared at the store time.
			; (I should pick an Alpha Architecture Manual
			;  and recheck my memory, "obviously" it should
			;  set the reg to be non-zero when the store
			;  succeeds.)
               beq tempreg,2f	; ... thus allowing this somewhat
			; convoluted way to branch back to label 1
			; in case the memory atomicity was violated
			; during the store.
