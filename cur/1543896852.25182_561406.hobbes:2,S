Ok, that makes sense. The problem is that desktop users don't know about such 
things, so the ideal situation would be that the scheduler knows about it and 
does it for you.

Yes, I see your point. In a scenario of dropping frames it seems that CFS does 
a better job. It's just that an ideal scheduler shouldn't drop frames in this 
case (it should give 70% to the video even without nicing the encoder).

That's my whole point. On a desktop, some tasks have by nature a higher 
priority than others. A fair scheduler treats them all the same (hence, fair) 
way. So a user must nice/renice processes for them to get the correct CPU 
time (something you can't expect normal desktop users to do).

Well, my point is that encoding music or video can use 100% CPU if available, 
but if you give it just 10% the job will also be completed successfully 
(though slower). OTOH, playing audio or video won't use 100% CPU (in most 
cases), but whatever CPU they need, they _really_ need it. It makes no sense 
to watch a video or listen to music with constant skips. So in 99.9% of the 
cases a user would want to watch a video smoothly, not dropping frames so 
that the encoding finishes faster (if he wants the encoding to be as fast as 
possible he shouldn't watch a video at the same time, I guess).
