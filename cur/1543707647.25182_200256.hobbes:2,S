I don't know why this:

is occurring.  It indicates that the filesystem metadata is corrupted.  You
should force a fsck to fix it up.  It could be a hardware problem (disk,
cable, controller, power supply, or even main memory).

This part is caused by a minor bug.
ext3_error() sleeps, so don't call it with the lock held.
