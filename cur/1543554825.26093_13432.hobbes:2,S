It is on filesystems which has ".." physically on disk.  Linux no
longer requires this, although for example ext2 does have this.
I don't believe it's inherently impossible in Linux anymore.  In fact,
vfsbinds provide a lot of the same kind of functionality; the main
difference between vfsbinds and hard links are that the former (a) can
cross filesystem boundaries and (b) aren't persistent.
