With the filesystems/VFS situation looks so (and I'm not going into IWBNI 
area, only code that needs fixing):
	ADFS, AFFS, HFS, NTFS, QNX4 - blatantly broken.
	UFS - needs cleanup/fixes.
	loopback, ramdisk, raid - more or less broken.
	CODA - will need serious testing after the expected large patch.
	procfs - needs decision on namespace policy/namespace rework. And
proper dealing with races on module offloading, but that's old story.
	That's just the most pressing stuff. I'm going to fork the -bird (aka
VFS-CURRENT) after 2.4.0 and will feed the stable/well-tested stuff back
into the main tree (with intention to collapse it after 2.5 will open),
but it would be nice if we could fix at least the stuff mentioned above
_before_ 2.4.
