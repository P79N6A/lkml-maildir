I think it's the same thing as on the newer broadcom bnx2, which I ran into.
There's some new enterprise managmenent thingy, ASF, that gets confused if
there are vlan tags present -> the driver is setup to strip them out if that
feature is enabled.
There is a dos-based tool to disable that bit on the bnx2 hardware
(which gives you those vlan tags back, vlans do work, you just can't
see them with tcpdump etc.), you can probably find one for tg3 as well
from broadcom.
