Not a beta, a work in progress.  I started it and help guide the
development, but ani joshi has been doing most of the recent coding.
Currently his snapshot works for 640x480x32 mode, including working in X
(XF86_FBDev).  With modedb support and a bit more testing, a beta
release can go out the door.
My current rivafb snapshot:

ani joshi's diff, against that:

Help from coders and testers is always welcome :)
Regards,
	Jeff
