Subject: sys_write() racy for multi-threaded append?

from sys_write():
        file = fget_light(fd, &fput_needed);
        if (file) {
                loff_t pos = file_pos_read(file);
                ret = vfs_write(file, buf, count, &pos);
                file_pos_write(file, pos);
                fput_light(file, fput_needed);
        }
Surely that's racy when two threads write to the same fd and the first
vfs_write call blocks or is preempted.  Or does fget_light take some
per-file lock that I'm not seeing?
