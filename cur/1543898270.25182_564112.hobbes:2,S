For some reason I am no longer able to reproduce the problem. I've
tried several versions including the one I reported and I just can't
reproduce the problem. I accidentally overwrote the original kernel
that had the problem. The weird thing is even when I reset the git
tree to 2.6.22-rc5-g75154f40 and build it, the error is gone.
I've tested with the latest git and all seems well so far. I'll keep a
close eye out and will try to run bisect to find the problem. Sorry, I
should have done that in the first place (Didn't know about it).
