Don't worry, Bill.  It doesn't look like anyone wants to change
cpumask_t to struct cpumask.  I just wasn't objecting to it - shouldn't
even have mentioned it.

I'll be doing that.  And I'm sure Andrew wouldn't consider it otherwise.

I think we can all heartily agree to that advice.

Ah - I think you just explained to me Rusty's 'That'd be a noop', to which
I had responded 'Huh?'.  Thanks.
And the added ampersands that Rusty added a couple of messages before that.
Duh ... smacking forehead.
Output operands need to be passed by pointer (which fact may or may not
be hidden in a macro ...).
At the risk of embarrassing myself again in public, how about this:
    typedef struct { DECLARE_BITMAP(bits, NR_CPUS); } cpumask_t;
    #define cpus_or(d,s1,s2) _cpus_or(&d, &s1, &s2)
    static inline void _cpus_or(cpumask_t *d, const cpumask_t *s1, const cpumask_t *s2)
    {
	bitmap_or(d->bits, s1->bits, s2->bits, NR_CPUS);
    }
It would be used exactly as it is today:
    cpumask_t x, y, z;
    cpus_or(x, y, z);

                          I won't rest till it's the best ...
