scalability. I did lock profiling on the -rt kernel, which exposes such 
things nicely. Half of the lock contention events during kernel compile 
were due to kmap(). (The system had 2 GB of RAM, so 40% lowmem, 60% 
highmem.)

the pagecache ones cannot be converted to kmap_atomic, because we can 
block while holding them. Plus kmap_atomic is quite a bit slower than 
this scalable version of kmap().

ps. please fix your mailer to not emit Mail-Followup-To headers. In Mutt
    you can do this via "set followup_to=no" in your .muttrc.
