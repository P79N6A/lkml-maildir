Wrong metric, unless you mean you can run the *compiler* on the cell  
phone.

And remember that interactions between features go up exponentially.
I think one of the worst design decisions for C++ (hindsight, of course)  
was to keep compatibility with C. The other bad one was to accept too many  
new features.
The Modula-3 standard (that's an OO variant of Modula-2) had as a language  
design goal that the language description should not take more than 50  
pages. They overshot that, but it still was much less than 100 (somewhat  
less precise than C/C++, admittedly). As a result, that language (and  
consequently, programs in that language) is *much* easier to understand  
than C++.
That doesn't mean I'm in love with Modula-3. Actually, I don't even use  
it, and I do think (hindsight again) some of the design decisions were  
unfortunate. But I do think keeping an eye on the sheer mass of the spec  
is a good idea.
