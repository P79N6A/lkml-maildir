Most of arch/ppc64/* uses #defines, for whatever that's worth. Still,
CodingStyle seems to recommend enums for "related constants", I assume
it's so they can be typed. I don't care enough either way to argue
it further.
Anyhow, enum or #define, it should be moved to bpa_iommu.h.

User or developer error? I thought it was a developer one, and a quite
specialized one at that. Either way, there's already a primitive that
can be used instead of making your own: BUILD_BUG_ON().

A comment to that effect could be nice.

I guess it'd be a bit much information to just add in a comment, but for
readability that's probably the best way to go.  Not many people have
the specs, but on the other hand if you're messing around with this code
then chances are you have them.
I don't know what the status is for a release of public specifications,
but if they're not available then people will be looking to learn from
the implementation and the documentation around it instead.
