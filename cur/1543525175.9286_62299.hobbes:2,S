That's what backwards compatibility _means_.

No --- ext2 can't arbitrarily read ext3 filesystems.  That would imply
*forwards* compatibility, which has never been claimed.  ext3 can leave
a filesystem in a state ext2 can deal with if you unmount cleanly,
allowing you to migrate between ext2 and ext3 easily, but ext2 simply
cannot be allowed to read and write uncleanly-unmounted ext3 filesystems
without first forcing the ext3 journal to be recovered (that would just
invite completely unnecessary filesystem corruption).

Yes!  It was chosen to keep the new codebase separate from the old,
trusted ext2 code.
