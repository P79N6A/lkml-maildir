We have created a sample text-mode reference UI (using keyctl from the
keyutils[1] package to interface with the key retention service) that
shows how everything works together. We are setting up some web space
to put such UI (actually a set of shell scripts) and we will provide
links soon.
Regarding the userspace tweaks, we have not gone into this aspect, but
just provided the "core" kernel code. Usually, those integrating the
system will dictate policies regarding password hashing, persistent
caching etc. The policies for our reference UI were:
- no hashing (password is sent/stored clear-text)
- in-memory caching (so if the user reboots the system, the password
will have to be re-typed).
I think those policies can be done still on userspace, so the kernel
code remains "policy-free".
