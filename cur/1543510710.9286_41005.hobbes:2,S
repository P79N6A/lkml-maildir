I don't think so.
Look at what is printed:
	count = bh->b_size >> 9;
	sector = bh->b_rsector;
	if (...) {
		printk("attempt to access beyond end of device\n");
		printk("%s: rw=%d, want=%d, limit=%d\n",
			kdevname(bh->b_rdev), rw,
			(sector + count)>>1,
			blk_size[major][MINOR(bh->b_rdev)]);
	}
The want= part is the result of a computation.
It would be very surprising if that produced recognizable strings.
But of course, 4 random bytes may by coincidence be 4 ASCII bytes.
