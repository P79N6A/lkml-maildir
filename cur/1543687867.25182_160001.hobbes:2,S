Hi Andrea,
	We don't know how many there are *outside* the tree during the
stable series, though.  It's really nice if APIs don't change
gratuitously during stable kernels, because there are lots of (free,
source available) patches which are outside the tree, and that's a
*good* thing, IMHO.
Change it now or leave it, IMHO.
Rusty.
