After having spent quite some time looking over the scheduler on the
2.2.10 kernel, I was under the impression that there isn't a guarantee
that the new thread will be run on a different CPU because of the
priority the scheduler gives to processes running on the same CPU with
shared VM.  This would of course only be the case if there is not an
idle CPU.  The chances of there not being an idle CPU especially on a
quad system is pretty unlikely I suppose.  Then again, I'm new at this
kernel hacking so I am probably completely wrong, I bow to you since
you've been doing kernel development longer than I.  There aren't a
whole lot of comments describing what is going on in a lot of the
kernel.
