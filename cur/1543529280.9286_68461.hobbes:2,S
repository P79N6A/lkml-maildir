It's fresh out of the box. I haven't added any wires to it myself :)
All that's connected to the secondary monitor output is a _very_ old mono VGA 
monitor.
Strangely, the picture on the second head is stretched vertically - so I can't
see the top and bottom of the picture.
When I swap the monitors over, I can see both pictures fine - but the decent 
monitor reports 31.4kHz horizontal frequency for the second head, which isn't 
right is it?
