There is another situation to consider which I think more typical in the
"Real World"
4 - The Typical Web server Environment, in many many companies that I have
seen.
  The machine runs both the DBMS(mysql, Oracle, etc) and the web server
Apache.  Therefore a balence of memory use needs to be struck between the
two applications.  Then ususally the system also has a development
environment at the ready incase changes need to be made quickly from the
console.  While this may not be true as things scale up for a business and
functions get separated to different machines.  Many startups and small
businesses that I have worked with that have turned to LINUX for the OS
becuase the TCO, it offers over the other guys, tend to have just that
single does everything box.
