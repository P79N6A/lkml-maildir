I'm not convinced that exec is correct.
app with two threads, cloned sighand and sig structures.
thread one does exec().
thread two does exit().
Now we can arrive at no_thread_group in de_thread() and 
tsk->sig{,hand}->count == 1.

signal sender: in send_sig_info().
reads tsk->signal. blocks on tsk->sighand->siglock.

And now the signal sender continues. BOOM.
sighand structure, sig structure already kfreed, etc.
