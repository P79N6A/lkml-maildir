Actually there are a couple of reasons it is relevant to Linux.
There is already code out there to run UDI drivers on a Linux system. If you
look, one of the demonstration systems was a Linux system. Intel did the
port. 
Intel has also made statements to the effect of reference drivers for it's
hardware are most likely going to be UDI. If this happens, you are going to
want UDI support just so you can bring up new Intel hardware fast.
With some work on the UDI interface, you should be able to make it so all
UDI drivers are RTLinux friendly. Also, you could change the
mutex/semaphore/locking code as many times as your little hearts desire
without having to rewrite every UDI driver. The UDI interface has all of the
mutex and timed waits happening outside the driver, in the UDI support
routines.
I would have thought that people would rather spend their time working on
improving the operating system rather than rewrite an ethernet or SCSI
device driver for the umpteenth time. That is what UDI is intended to allow
you to do, focus on the OS and use standard drivers.

How about just a documented driver interface that doesn't change? The
interface has changed for EVERY KERNEL VERSION lately.
The 2.0 drivers had to be modified for 2.2. I believe I've seen indications
that further SMP patches will make it necessary to change the drivers again
for 2.4, although I haven't found any documentation that clearly spells this
out.
Where is the documentation on writing drivers for Linux? I've got the Rubini
book, which is stuck back in kernel version 1.2 for a lot of stuff. There
are enough changes where none of his examples compile correctly under 2.2.
It wasn't until I started compiling stuff that I found out that the PCI
interface had changed, I have no idea how many other things have changed
since the time of the book.
