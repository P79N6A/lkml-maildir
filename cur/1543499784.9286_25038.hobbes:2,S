[First up, let me say that your tone offends me a little, but I
have taken a while to breath calmly, so I will actually answer you.
I have learned from dealing with my small children :-)]
OK, lets see ...  the power off changes add 1 variable (4 bytes), and
the passing of 1 integer in two places in the kernel (8 bytes), and add
two tests.  One of these is in the code that is executed when you are
trying to power off your machine and the other is in the initialisation
code that is discarded after the kernel is initialised.  Total 12 bytes
in the running kernel and 1 test that is hardly in the "common path"!
The debug change does actually add about 140 bytes af data to the
kernel.  It also adds 1 test to the code.  This test is in the
routine that gets events from the BIOS and believe me, calling the
BIOS swamps anything we do!  What do we gain?  Well when people
report problems, I used to have to say "Please edit apm.c and define
APM_DEBUG and then rebuild the kernel and then reproduce the problem
and tell me what you get in your logs"  now I can say "reboot and
pass apm=debug to the kernel and ...".  Can you see how I can
justify this?
If you have ANY problems of substance, please let us know ...
Cheers,
Stephen
