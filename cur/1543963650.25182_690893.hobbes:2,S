excerpt from Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:
        isolcpus=       [KNL,SMP] Isolate CPUs from the general scheduler.
                        Format:
                        <cpu number>,...,<cpu number>
                        or
                        <cpu number>-<cpu number>  (must be a positive range in ascending order)
                        or a mixture
                        <cpu number>,...,<cpu number>-<cpu number>
                        This option can be used to specify one or more CPUs
                        to isolate from the general SMP balancing and scheduling
                        algorithms. The only way to move a process onto or off
                        an "isolated" CPU is via the CPU affinity syscalls.
                        <cpu number> begins at 0 and the maximum value is
                        "number of CPUs in system - 1".
                        This option is the preferred way to isolate CPUs. The
                        alternative -- manually setting the CPU mask of all
                        tasks in the system -- can cause problems and
                        suboptimal load balancer performance.
And then use sched_set_affinity to fill your CPUs.
Happy imaging :-)
