FWIW, a series of explicit assignments to zero puffs up the code on x86.
Several GCC releases using the default kernel -O2 build are too dumb to zero
EAX, or some other reg, and assign using it, so you're looking at 4 bytes of
immediate zero plus opcode ModRm/SIB.  If the locations being assigned
happened to be statics you can often wind up with a 10 byte instruction to
zero a single dword somewhere.
I have tried a few tricks trying to get GCC to not use this 4 byte immediate
0 in non speed critical areas all to no avail (ex. foo &= 0;  the AND
instruction can use a one byte sign extended operand, but GCC morphs
something like " &= 0" into a straight up "MOV thing,imm32" instruction)
