	Hello Peter ,  I am having a bit of difficulty getting the
	ISO image to boot .  Below is what I get on the console .
	Best transcription I could get at this time .  Also fyi
	ISOLINUX 1.48 1999-09-26 boots OK on the same machine .
	I have also heard a (vicious;-) rumor that 1.63 cure this
	difficulty .  When are you going to upgrade ?
	But XXXX this is a nice tool !  I am -very- thankful to you
	for putting this kind of power into one cdrom .
		Thank you ,  JimL
