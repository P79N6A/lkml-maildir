Yes. I got as far as looking at elf.h, and noting that the header file
alone wouldn't tell me much about alignment, ordering, and other rules.
I believe there is an ELF developer document somewhere at metalab.unc.edu,
mixed in with gcc somewhere. (not in the LDP area)
For development purposes, a script using binutils stuff might be
the most practical. Like this:
1. create /tmp/plain, with any capabilities info removed
2. create /tmp/cap, containing the binary blob (or nulls if none)
3. run a simple tool to hack the capabilities info
4. merge the two parts back together
Eventually it would be nice to have a tool that uses capabilities
itself to provide enhanced executables for authorized users.
Results would be stripped of write permission of course, and the
operation could be logged.

This is good. For future expansion, a kernel feature bitmap (like ext2 has)
or minimum version number might be good to have.

Sure, but I need to do lots of reading before I could code it.

Speaking of which... how would you like the ps program to show them?
I can have ps print capabilities as soon as I find a good format.
(hex is not friendly, but text is far too wide -- preferences?)

I think a tagged format might be better. You need 3 capabilities
entries, and they are likely to grow in size with time. Someone
will surely want to add auditing, etc.
Something like this:
signature
flags
effective capabilities type code
effective capabilities length
effective capabilities data
[same thing for permitted]
[same thing for inheritable]
uid type code
uid mapping
uid array length
uid list
[same for primary gid]
addgid type code (additional supplementary group IDs)
addgid array length
addgid list
[same thing to remove undesired supplementary group IDs]
I could do an editor on the weekend. Would it help?
(no nice ELF section support unless I get instructions)
In the kernel, the UID handling goes like this:
int uids[8];
uids[0] = current->uid;
uids[1] = current->euid;
uids[2] = current->suid;
uids[3] = current->fsuid;
uids[4] = cap.uids[0]; /* must add length checking */
uids[5] = cap.uids[1];
uids[6] = cap.uids[2];
uids[7] = cap.uids[3];
foo->uid   = uids[(cap.uidmap >>  0) & 7];
foo->euid  = uids[(cap.uidmap >>  4) & 7];
foo->suid  = uids[(cap.uidmap >>  8) & 7];
foo->fsuid = uids[(cap.uidmap >> 12) & 7];
As you can see, this lets the executable select all 4 UID values
from those of the executable or from those of the process.
There is room to add a login ID or audit ID as an additional source.
