include/asm-generic/errno.h says that 75 is EOVERFLOW.
Now look in Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt and it says that
EOVERFLOW is used for:
-EOVERFLOW (*)		The amount of data returned by the endpoint was
			greater than either the max packet size of the
			endpoint or the remaining buffer size.  "Babble".
The device returned too much data.
See whichever host controller driver you are using for details.
