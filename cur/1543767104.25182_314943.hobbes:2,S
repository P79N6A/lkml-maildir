Looked deeper into the code, and realized that in procfs, the symlink is
not followed through link_path_walk(). instead it is expected to
return the root vfsmount of the traversed process as you rightly
pointed.

Yes. But proc_check_root() in proc_pid_follow_link() is failing the 
traversal, because it is expecting the root vfsmount of the traversed
process to belong to the vfsmount tree of the traversing process.
In other words its expecting them to be both in the same namespace.
The permissions get denied by this code in proc_check_root():
         while (vfsmnt != our_vfsmnt) {
                if (vfsmnt == vfsmnt->mnt_parent)
                        goto out;
                de = vfsmnt->mnt_mountpoint;
                vfsmnt = vfsmnt->mnt_parent;
        }
