How about this: pnpbios functions that scan the device list
optionally (depending on a flag of some sort, set according to
whether or not one has an evil BIOS) cause the list to be rebuilt
first.  This would require only slight changes to the code.
I would offer a patch, but I don't know how the aforementioned
flag should be implemented.
