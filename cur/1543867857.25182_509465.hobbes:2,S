Speaking of that patch, I missed the discussion, but I'd hope it doesn't
go upstream in its current form.
We now have one way of walking range of ptes. The code may be duplicated a
few times, but it is simple, we know how it works, and it is easy to get
right because everyone does the same thing.
We used to have about a dozen slightly different ways of doing this until
Hugh spent the effort to standardise it all. Isn't it nice?
If we want an ever-so-slightly lower performing interface for those paths
that don't care to count every cycle -- which I think is a fine idea BTW
-- it should be implemented in mm/memory.c and it should use our standard
form of pagetable walking.
