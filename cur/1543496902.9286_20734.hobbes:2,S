   Question: Since tty_flip_buffer_push just shoves the request onto tq_timer,
   is it valid to use a private tty_flip_buffer_push that checks if the buffer
   is looking close to full and pushes it onto tq_immed then marks that queue
   to be run on the irq return (remembering we have no fast irq paths in 2.2
   any more)
   In fact, couldnt tty_flip_buffer_push do this ?
It could, but the definition of what's considered "close" differs from
UART to UART, depending on how big the FIFO is.  It's a good idea,
though.  It's worth thinking about, though; it's a good idea.
