This smells fishy.

inline function please and a bit more intuituive arrangement of
arguments.

That's not enforced. The unmap code just does not split pages.

How is this ensured, that it only affects the end of the 40MB mapping ?

This checks:
     (kernel_end + 1) >= gart_start && kernel_start <= gart_end
One off error:  kernel + KERNEL_TEXT_SIZE 
needs to be:    kernel + KERNEL_TEXT_SIZE - 1
Also there is no sanity check, whether the area is inside real kernel text.

Doh! This is unmapping the wrong place. According to __phys_addr():
     paddr = vaddr - __START_KERNEL_map + phys_base;
Transformation:
     vaddr = padd + __START_KERNEL_map - phys_base;
Sigh. The clear_kernel_mapping() functionality is just another wreckaged
implementation of CPA.
We really should use CPA and have a function to mark entries not
present. Actually the DEBUG_PAGEALLOC code has one already. There are
sanity checks in the CPA code as well, which can be extended to cover
the GART unmap in a safe way.
Thanks,
