There are non-performance issues as well (really, all of these points
have been mentioned in this thread btw).  One is that since paged
SKBs use only single-order page allocations, the memory allocation
subsystem is stressed less than the current scheme where SLAB
allocates multi-order pages to satisfy allocations of linear SKB data
buffers.
This has consequences and benefits system wide.
