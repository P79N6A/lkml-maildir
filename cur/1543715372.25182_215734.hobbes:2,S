True, but non-working hardware is even worse.

I don't think this is true at all.

If they provide a binary for Linux, then they can claim Linux support.
We may not like it, but it is a legitimate claim.

True, but this is just noise in the signal in terms of what the less
informed users think.

- some driver code is tied up in legal issues that are not currently
  solvable
- For some hardware, only the company has enough knowledge to write
  a decent driver.  I can't blame a company for wanting to control
  the drivers for their hardware for quality reasons.
- As a user, I need to get work done, not play politics with my
  hardware.  I prefer open solutions, but each day I have work to
  do and can't afford to play politics with my hardware.
- I personally don't believe that building barriers to binary drives is
  helpful.  In fact, I think it ultimately means *less* open source
  from manufacturers.  I think of a good binary interface as a good
  ambassador.

Of course.  We live in a highly imperfect world, and the computer
industry is among the most imperfect parts of it.
At the same time, we need to make sure that in our posturing and
political moves, we don't end up making things worse.

Sounds illogical to me.
That's like saying that selling a turbocharger for a car is the same as
illegally copying the design of a car and selling it as your own.

True.  Also useful would be to get manufacturers involved in any
such list so you can hear from them.
