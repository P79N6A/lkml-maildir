It's not legacy it is still the optimal address.  The amount of memory
required to load the kernel is directly related to how much low memory
the decompresser can use.  If you move it lower you need more memory
above 1MB to load the kernel.
To load the real mode code at < 0x90000 requires a fairly
sophisticated bootloader.  You have already convinced me how it is bad
for bootloaders to make BIOS calls on behalf of the kernel, and how
bad it is to need bootloaders to change.  So unless the real mode code
does the int 12 call itself and relocates itself as high as it can go
I really don't see the default load address changing.  And I am
documenting the default load address.
I'd like to change the way we do this, so I'm going to stare at this
problem a little bit more.  Changing the default load address and
still being able to compute how much memory the kernel is going
to use is a challenge.
