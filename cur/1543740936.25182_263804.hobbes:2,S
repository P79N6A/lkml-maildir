It is an unlikely scenario, but it is definitely good for robustness.
Especially on small memory systems where the amount allocated doesn't
have to be that large.
Let's say a 16MB system pages_low ~= 64K, so we'll also say we've
currently got 64K free. Someone then wants to do an order 4 allocation
OK they succeed (assuming memory isn't fragmented) and there's 0K free.
Which is bad because you can now get deadlocks when trying to free
memory.

Oh if you've still got the three watermarks then that may work -
I thought you meant getting rid of one of the *completely*.
But I'm still not sure what advantage you see in moving from
pages_xxx + protection to a single watermark.
