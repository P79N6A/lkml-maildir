I am looking to buy some ethernet cards.  PCI of course.  I have an
SMP machine and am looking to see what kind of experiences people here
have had and what they recommend.  I'd like to get some fairly
inexpensive cards (less than $100 if possible).  Any info would be
greatly appreciated.
Also was there ever a linux hardware mailing list started?
please cc me as I am not on the mailing list
