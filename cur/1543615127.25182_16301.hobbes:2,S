Slightly off topic ... but I couldn't think of a better place to ask, or
at least not one with more knowledgable people on the subject.
I'm looking to upgrade my Motherboard.
So I'm wondering which Athlon/XP motherboard you guys would use? I know
there were (or are?) problems with some of the VIA chipsets and most of
the Athlon MoBos seem to use some VIA chipset.
Anyway. Suggestions welcome.
Thanks,
EAM
