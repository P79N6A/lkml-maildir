Jaroslav (perex, the main ALSA dude) has been given the thumbs up by
Alan Cox on the ALSA mailing list. OSS and ALSA will co-exist over a
transition period, with ALSA gently phasing out OSS drivers until no
more OSS drivers exist. Not a moment too soon, either.
GGI seems less likely (lots of opposition). Richard's devfs patch is
far more interesting: it got (one) positive response from Linus, but
lots of negative responses from other key developers. I'd like devfs
to be officially included too, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
