You might conclude from the above that the lru+rmap is superior to 
aging+rmap: while they show the same wall-clock time, lru+rmap consumes 
considerably less disk bandwidth.  Naturally, it would be premature to 
conclude this from one trial on one load.
These patches need benchmarking - lots of it, and preferrably in the next few 
days.
We need to see cpu stats as well.
