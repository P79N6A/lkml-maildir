IMHO more important: what about utmp?  It would become terribly
large.  Beside that, such huge numbers won't fit into ut_id.
Ciao, ET.
--[man utmp extract]--
...
    char ut_id[4];     /* init id or abbrev. ttyname */
...
    xterm(1)  and  other  terminal emulators directly create a
    USER_PROCESS record and generate the ut_id  by  using  the
    last  two  letters  of  /dev/ttyp%c  or  by  using p%d for
    /dev/pts/%d.  If they find a  DEAD_PROCESS  for  this  id,
    they  recycle  it,  otherwise they create a new entry.
