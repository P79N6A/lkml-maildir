   We've tried a number of boards for our application servers and the only UP 
   AMD DDR board I trust right now is the Gigabyte GA-7DX.  They are rock 
   solid.
Try to use the AGP slot with a Radeon of GeForce card, do something
as simple as playing some quake with com_maxfps > 85 and the machine
will hang solidly.
