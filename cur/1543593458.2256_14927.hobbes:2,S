This is just pure bollocks.  Virtual memory is one of the killer features of
unix. It would be a strange admission to say that our "advanced" 2.4
kernel is so advanced that now you can't use virtual memory at all on
large machines. Needing 8GB of swap to prevent a box from committing
suicide when it has a working set of less than 512M is crazy.
I am waiting patiently for the bug to be fixed. However, it is a real
embarrasment that we can't run this "stable" kernel in production yet
because somethign as fundamental as this is so badly broken.
