Hello!
  Just mounted remote NFS volume by 2.3.40 box in the last evening, went
  back today and found that NFS works "strangely"
angband:/mnt# ls
/bin/ls: .: Stale NFS file handle
angband:/mnt# cd ..
angband:/mnt/..# ls
/bin/ls: mnt: Stale NFS file handle
(That's where I checked my eyes!)
NFS server is unfsd on 2.2.15pre4 box.
Bye,
    Oleg
