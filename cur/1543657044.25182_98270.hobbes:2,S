It's normal C behaviour. I wouldn't even call it a quirk.
	1 << cpu
is clearly an int, and as such will have undefined behaviour for cpu >
bits-of-int.
The promotion to unsigned long happens _after_ the shift has already
happened as an int, since nothing in the sub-expression needs promotion
per se.
As undefined behaviour, the C compiler is _allowed_ to do what we meant,
but quite frankly, a C compiler that would take the undefined behaviour
case and turn it into the "unsigned long" behaviour we were looking for
would be quite interesting and almost certainly just random luck.
So if you want to test a bit in an "unsigned long", you should do either
	(x >> bit) & 1
(where the shift will be on a "long", and the binary and will also be
automatically promoted to a unsigned long) or you should do
	x & (1UL << bit)
which is what the patch did (it's applied in 2.5.53 already, btw).
