yep - i can confirm this theory now: if i start a broadcast ping on 
another box while the laptop is booting up, the network hang does not 
happen. If i stop the ping and do another bootup with the very same 
kernel, it hangs. So for the hang to happen, the network has to be very 
quiet. At least one mystery solved :-/
