While the changes to the net driver are well documented, the changes
to the various bh operations are not. If one had some clue what these
changes were one might fix the broken drivers. (I was easily able to
change vmnet to compile with the guide to the tbusy changes, but I
haven't yet been able to figure out what has happened to
start_bh_atomic or end_bh_atomic.)
