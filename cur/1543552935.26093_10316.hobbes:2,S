Subject: installing an ISR from user code

We have written a char driver for our proprietary h/w.  This driver
handles a
multitude of interrupts from the h/w in the following fashion:  The ISR
reads/saves the status register (indication of which int was hit) in
global, and the marks the BH to run.  The BH uses the global to call one
of 32 "ISRs" (an array of func ptrs).  I would like to be able to
install an "ISR" dynamically from user code (the module has already been
installed).  Is this possible?
If it is possible, how does the build/link work?
thanks,
