Having a checksum (or even a digital signature on a file) that lets us 
detect corruption is very useful since, in many cases, it allows us to 
flag the file as corrupt before it gets used.
In some cases, this is a big hint that you should restore it from backup 
(tape, other disk, etc).
I think that it is a generally useful thing even when not on a self 
correcting device,
