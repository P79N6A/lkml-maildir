My guess is that this system spaces out its KCS registers, but there 
appears to be no way to specify register spacing or offsets with PCI.  
That would mean that the configuration register appears operational to 
the driver, but the data register is returning bogus data.  Thus it 
appears "sort of" working to the driver, and it takes a long time to 
time out.
I'm pretty sure it's possible to test to figure out where the registers 
are really located.  However, I have no way to test this change.  All 
the other configuration methods have a way to discover this information.
Jiri, we should probably take this offline if you want to continue to 
work on it.
Thanks,
