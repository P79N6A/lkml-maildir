This point is valid, but I don't think the users will _have_ _to_ switch to the
userland suspend.  AFAICT we are going to keep the kernel-based code
as long as necessary.
We are just going to implement features in the user space that need not be
implemented in the kernel.  Of course they can be implemented in the
kernel, and you have shown that clearly, but since they need not be there,
we should at least try to implement them in the user space and see how this
works.
Frankly, I have no strong opinion on whether they _should_ be implemented
in the user space or in the kernel, but I think we won't know that until
we actually _try_.
That said, I like the idea and I'm going to work on it.  I'll also appreciate
any help very much.
Greetings,
Rafael
