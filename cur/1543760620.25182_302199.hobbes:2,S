Which I am doing here I believe, and my current dmesg ring does go 
back to the tail end of whats in /var/log/dmesg, but:  Its got a lot 
of crap about tainted kernels, AND its not by any means all from the 
stuff that pcHDTV-1.6 builds and inserts into the /var/modules/`name 
-r`/kernel/drivers etc etc directories. Its also bitching about 
nearly every i2c module loaded!  With lines along the general theme 
of this:
--------------
i2c_core: No versions for exported symbols. Tainting kernel.
i2c_algo_bit: No versions for exported symbols. Tainting kernel.
kobject_register failed for i2c_algo_bit (-17)
 [<c020d487>] kobject_register+0x57/0x60
 [<c012c3a0>] mod_sysfs_setup+0x50/0xb0
 [<c012d589>] load_module+0x889/0xb70
 [<c012d8c6>] sys_init_module+0x56/0x220
 [<c01026d9>] sysenter_past_esp+0x52/0x75
-----------
and yet, gkrellm, and sensors are both working quite nicely.  WTH?
I am rather certain that versioning info in the modules IS turned on 
in the .config:
However, a grep of .config makes a liar out of me, it is NOT set:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.11.2]# grep VERSION .config
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=""
# CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is not set
# CONFIG_MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL is not set
Rebuild coming up. :(
