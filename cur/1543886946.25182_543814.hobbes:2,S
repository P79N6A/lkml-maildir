Hello,
I tested cfs v11 on 2.6.20.10 and here are my results:
I started 6 md5sum /dev/urandom and 3 glxgears
with 2 glxgears X was still very responsive...but after starting the
third one there where noticeable lags when using X... so I reniced it
to -10 and its very smooth again.
I am now writing this mail with this task in the background...
one more thing: opening a new tab in gnome-terminal has a noticeable
delay same for typing su
I am using compiz with the nvidia 100.14.03 beta drivers on a core 2
duo T7400 x86_64 with a nvidia 7600 Go...
after starting an other md5sum /dev/urandom there are some notice able
delays when typing....
(resending)
p.s: please CC me
