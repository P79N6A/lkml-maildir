It is a bad week for 3c509's I guess. I just spent 2 or 3 days trying to
find out why my 3c509 (not 3c509b) vanished from the setup at 2.3.45 and
once it worked I find that 2.3.47 recognizes it and inits it but now
has the same complaint 'SIOCSIFFLAGS: operation not supported by device'
when dhcpcd tries to run its startup routine The log entry is:
Feb 21 13:23:42 Quarto dhcpcd[184]: 
dhcpStart: ioctl SIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not supported by device
Perhaps I need to switch to a newer NIC just to avoid the exercise in
frustration.
I appreciate all of the help and encouragement I got from Craig Kulesa,
Jeff Garzik and Alan Cox  on the earlier problem (it was an address
conflict.)
