I don't know what FSK/CW/RTTY/BAUDOT is.

Not true.

You may be confusing the old-style baud rate lookup table (B9600 et
al) with the actual capabilities of the serial port. The lookup table
has a limited number of baud rates. You can get more rates than that
using a custom divisor. Most motherboard-based serial ports are
clocked at 1.8432 Mhz. The UART does 16 samples per bit time, yielding
a max baud rate of 115200.
115200 / 25 yields 4608, which is a 1.4% error rate from 4545. This
may or may not be acceptable. 115200 / 2535 yields 45.44, which is a
0.01% error rate, which is likely acceptable.

We make serial port boards with very flexible UARTS. 4545 exactly is
achievable. 45.45 too. Linux supported.
