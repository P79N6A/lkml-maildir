There is a remaining question: how/whether to implement this interface
in USB HID.....
On page 9 of the document you'll find at:
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/input/DigitizerDrvs_touch.mspx
Microsoft is claiming in that document of December 8 they are proposing
the interfaces in the document to the USB IF organization, and that
hardware vendors for Windows 7 should follow that spec.
Jiri, Greg:
1) Does anyone know if Microsoft has actually made the proposal to the
USB IF?  Is there anyone in the community watching/commenting on USB IF
proposals?
2) do you want generic USB HID patches or do you want to, for now,
confine these to USB device specific drivers as much as possible?
