The part that gets me here, and that others might be missing,
is that we are not waiting for ftruncate at this point.
We're waiting for unlink.  The application that was doing ftruncate
in tiny little doses has been sent a kill-9 signal, so what should
be happening now (confirmed by disk activity LEDs) is the file should
just be getting deleted the same as if we did "rm bigfile" on it.
And I kind of expected sync or remount,ro to complete *after* the
unlink finishes..
Oh well.
