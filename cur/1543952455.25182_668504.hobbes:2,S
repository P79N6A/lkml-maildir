Sure:

F5 and F6 have no second function printed on them. Thus their
definitions have been removed from the table.
KEY_CYCLEWINDOWS doesn't name the function of Mac OS X' Exposé properly
and because we couldn't find a better key code, we decided to use
KEY_FN_F4 instead.
We also changed KEY_BACK and KEY_FORWARD, which apply to browser
functions, to KEY_PREVIOUSSONG and KEY_NEXTSONG, since the keys are
intended to control a music player.

Does this contain enough details?
Thanks,
Michael
