That was my initial reaction too, but Jaroslav clearly wants a
higher-level generic hierarchy. Which means that we're not talking about
_drivers_ any more, we're talking about something that is much more
closely related to a "networking" kind of thing.
So we could have a net-based setup, where there would be a totally
separate "linux/sound" and "linux/drivers/sound". Which doesn't seem to
make much sense either.
Or we could just have a really _deep_ hierarchy, and put everything under
"linux/drivers/sound/..", but I'd rather break cleanly with the old.
