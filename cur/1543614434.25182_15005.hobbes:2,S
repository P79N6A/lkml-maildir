No, it is a bug fix.  The existing code in kernel/printk.c has
/* Keep together for sysctl support */
int console_loglevel = DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL;
int default_message_loglevel = DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL;
int minimum_console_loglevel = MINIMUM_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL;
int default_console_loglevel = DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL;
and hopes that gcc will keep those variables together.  The sysctl code
only addresses console_loglevel and assumes that the other three
variables are at the next addresses.  There is no requirement for gcc
to keep unrelated variables in the order they are defined, on i386 it
does, on ia64 it does not.  On ia64, doing
   echo 1 2 3 4 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
changes console_loglevel then corrupts three random words, whatever
variables gcc put after console_loglevel are destroyed.
