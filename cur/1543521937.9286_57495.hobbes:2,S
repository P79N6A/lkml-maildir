Subject: Linux crypto patch for 2.3 kernels

I've been porting the "International (crypto) Kernel Patch" for the Linux
2.2 kernels from www.kerneli.org to the 2.3 development kernels.  You can
find the patches against kernel 2.3 at 
http://www.sericyb.com.au/
 and I
hope that as a result of the new US regulations on crypto export that take
effect today this can be included in the official kernels soon.
Cheers,
