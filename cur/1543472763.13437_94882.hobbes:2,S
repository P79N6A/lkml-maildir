    Sorry to apear somewhat nit-picking: but that seems not to be the case.
    I have a kernel who claims to support this, i have a mount which claims to
    support this compiled against said kernel.  When i try "umount -f" on
    a NFS volume i simply get the message that it is not supported.
Not that I would be surprised if "umount -f" did not work,
but on the other hand, you could be helpful and tell the
mount maintainer about your problems instead of just muttering
on some random list.
If you get "umount: forced umount not supported yet", then
you are using an old umount.
If you get "umount: compiled without support for -f", then
umount was compiled without support for -f. If there was
a new kernel then you might describe precisely what include files
and kernel and libc you are using (at compile time and at invocation time).
If you get something else, then please describe what you get in detail.
