Subject: [PATCH] device_for_each_child(): kill pointless warning noise
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

As the last patch demonstrated, it is quite valid for a caller to ignore
the return value of device_for_each_child(), given that the return value
is wholly dependent on the actor -- which in practice often has a
hardcoded return value.
Please apply, to reduce a portion of the warning explosion seen in
current linux-2.6.git.
