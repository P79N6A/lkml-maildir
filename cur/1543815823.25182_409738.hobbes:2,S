That's one of its modes, mostly used for people with broken APICs. 
But the primary mode of operation is an  event based sampler using 
performance counter events.

Sounds like something that should be discussed in the spec.

It can be used with an aggressive white list and if you know what you're
doing. The x86-64 kernel follows this approach, which allows to use
it at least on some common classes of systems (AMD single core, Intel
non NUMA P4) 
Actually for cycle counting it is useless because on newer Intel CPUs
it always runs at the highest P state no matter which P state you're in.
My evil plan to deal with that was to export the cycle count running in PMC0
for the NMI watchdog to ring 3 so people could just use RDPMC 0 instead.
There was some opposition to this idea unfortunately.
But the hypervisor should keep its fingers out of all that as far as possible.

This might sound arrogant, but I would expect that near all modern
kernels don't use much more of the x86 subset than Linux is using
(biggest exception I can think of would be interrupt priorities)

So basically you're trying to implement VT/Pacifica in software
with all these trap? 
I'm not sure that's the right approach.
My feeling would be that for a efficient para virtualized interface a better
approach would be to try to optimize the kernels a bit more 
for the emulated case.
Longer term there will be more optimizations (like better interaction
of VM maybe or para drivers that work faster). But if the base interface
is already so big that adding even more stuff might make it explode
at some point.

Actually i got a feature request today that would require to optionally
do a wrmsr in the context switch :/
