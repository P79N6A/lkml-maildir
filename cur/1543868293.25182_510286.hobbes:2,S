Well, of course developers will complain, they _always_ complain. But
it is very different kind of complain... first is
'I think you are violating the law, you are evil'
and second is
'Thank you for playing by the rules, but you know, your code is not
mergeable right now'.

Yep, and guess what, thats okay. Someone with more time than they do
