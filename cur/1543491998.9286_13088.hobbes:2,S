"always" and "always unless condition X is met" are _not_ the same
thing. The standard says "always shall exit with a value other than
zero", so unless it _always_ exits with a value other than zero, it
does not comply to the standard. It's quite simple, really.

You utterly failed to understand that standard excerpt, didn't you?
