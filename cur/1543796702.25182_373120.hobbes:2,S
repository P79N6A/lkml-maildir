I may be misremembering, it didn't seem important at the time.  Less
than 10 seconds, anyways.

If you wanted to compute "What's the absolute perfect 99.9999th
percentile amount to free", yes, that would be impossibly
system-dependent.
But some kind of rule of thumb should get good results in most cases,
and it should be easy enough to add a knob for people who have
particular requirements.

That's boring. :)  The current behavior isn't bad enough to force me
back.

I'll play with this a bit tonight but I'd love to see a patch that makes
it a tunable.  Rebooting my laptop is sloooow and annoying (due to slow
startup scripts and losing all my state), but trying various suspend
settings sounds like a fun experiment.
