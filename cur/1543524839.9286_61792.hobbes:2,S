Hi,
I am seeing low IDE performance w/ kernel 2.3.42:
I have a Seagate Barracuda ATA, which transfers data at 28.2MB/s on the
outer recording zone on Windows NT. The harddisk is setup as master, alone
on the primary channel running off an Intel BX PIIX4e controller. Kernel
compiled SMP w/ 2x 550MHz iCelerons on an Abit BP6 motherboard.
Before and after I setup the harddisk with DMA and all other tweaks
available from hdparm, I still get ~15MB/s.
Is there any IDE debugging code still in the IDE/block subsystem? - I recall
there being some from earlier kernels.....
After looking for some, I failed to find any - any pointers?
Also, what's the best way to enlarge the buffer-cache and page-cache tables?
Thanks,
Dan
