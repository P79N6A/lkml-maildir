Changing the speed of memory may make a difference if, and only if
the machine is memory I/O bound. When compiling the kernel, your
machine is quite likely disk I/O bound. Most of your time may
be spent waiting for I/O to complete. Any RAM access time is lost
in the noise since it's so small by comparison.
A computing system has many of the characteristics of a low-pass filter.
The dominant pole in the system's transfer function is set by the slowest
device being accessed.
