Won't the i2o_block driver use i2o_block_device_flush to flush the devices' cache (by issuing a
I2O_CMD_BLOCK_CFLUSH), or this this function used in some very different context?
Oddly enough, I see I2O_CMD_BLOCK_CFLISH #define'd to 0x37 in both the i2o driver
(include/linux/i2o.h), AND in the dpt driver (drivers/scsi/dpt/dpti_i2o.h).  However, I do not see
the dpt driver using this value anywhere.
