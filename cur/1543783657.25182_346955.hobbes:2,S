Hi!
I think, I have found the problem with SCSI-Tapes
(Error 80000).
I have detect, that the sgraidmon is testing all sg-devices,
and if the inquiry-command fails (timeout) it sends a bus-
reset-command (ioctl) as "recovery"-operation !
After stopping the sgraidmon I have no more problems with
the tape.
Can anybody confirm this?
