How about "what happens after that move-to-NULL if you have a cwd inside
the subtree", for starters?

No, but I'd rather see the rules for callers of sysfs/kobject primitives
spelled out - before cleanups or review become even possible.

Umm...  IIRC, there'd been a lot of fun with tty and procfs sides of that;
will check.

OK...  You do have a point, but at this stage I'm not convinced that this
thing is safe and usable.  I agree that patches do not make things worse,
but I suspect that the real problem with kobject_move() is that it's a
fundamentally broken interface.
