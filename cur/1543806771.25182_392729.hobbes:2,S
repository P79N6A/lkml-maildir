libscg being there for 10 years doesn't means that it's the right or the
better way of doing things.
Hal is _the_ HAL for linux, in fact HAL is targetted to become _the_
"standard" (freedesktop standard) HAL for open operative systems. HAL
should be already available on solaris, at least there's a @sun.com guy
who created a hald/solaris/ directory (gnome is already using HAL and
sun is interested in gnome). It doesn't seem to do nothing today but I
bet that sun is interested in getting HAL working in solaris (there're
at least people in the opensolaris mailing lists interested). I guess
the BSD guys will end up implementing BSD support some day aswell - desktop
is not as important for them as it is for linux.
So the fact is that HAL is quickly becoming _the_ HAL for unix systems.
