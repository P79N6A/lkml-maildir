Yes, I read Alexey's email.  He said that it is not a kernel or a setkey
issue.  One of them is responsible for making sure the proper order is set
in order to insure RFC conformance and interoperability.  You are saying
that it is up to the user application, which would be setkey.  So if you
would prefer to not do this in the kernel you can ignore the patch, but
then the setkey application needs to be fixed.
