Ok, went back and looked at this. I think the core concept is fine,
but there are details such as having a data pointer associated with
the notifier block which is too important to leave out. Otherwise we
have to stick things into the task struct in many cases which is a
waste of space. I also think it needs to be possible to search the
list for special slow path uses to avoid us adding excessive amounts
of callbacks that are only used in one place by one client.
If we can cross-API it for task-group-notifiers then that should be
fine.
Cheers,
Jes
