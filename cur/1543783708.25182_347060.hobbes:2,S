You do have ->release and ->make_item/group.
If I may hand you a more substantive argument: you don't support user-driven
creation of files in configfs, only directories.  Dlmfs supports user-created
files.  But you know, there isn't actually a good reason not to support
user-created files in configfs, as dlmfs demonstrates.
Anyway, goodnight.

Daniel
