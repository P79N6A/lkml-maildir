Has something changed? Last I looked, the whole lmbench timing harness
was based on using the FPU. That was the cause of the big argument
Larry and I had some years back: my context switch benchmark didn't
use the FPU, and thus was more sensitive to variations (such as cache
misses due to aliasing).
