The Linux community as a whole don't believe in UDI.
When we are writing drivers hand tuned to each pci stall and cache miss
something like UDI starts to look very crude and inadequate. Instead we
support a mostly common (its getting better) API across all platforms for
the Linux drivers.
Thus things like pci_present() and ioremap() work on all machines equivalently
