I just updated to 2.6.12-rc4 and now /dev/input/mouse0 seems to be my ps2
keyboard. My ps2 mouse is now on /dev/input/mouse1.
Good thing to catch before you release 2.6.12 and get the usual swarm of "my
mouse stopped working" reports. It seems to be getting to be a pattern:
upgrade linux kernel -- debug why mouse stopped working.
