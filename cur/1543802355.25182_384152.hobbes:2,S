You should do the clear statement that the direct using of syscalls is not 
recommented for application developers. Unfortunately at this time, I 
admit, it would be very difficult to change the existing applications.
I can only suggest to OSS including the commercial version:
1) create a osslib package under GPL and probably also under BSD licence
2) notify developers in your documentation that every syscall has own
   function in osslib and that using syscalls directly is not recommended
In this way, your library will go to all Linux distributions and OSS app 
developers will have quite confirmed the right direction from you.
