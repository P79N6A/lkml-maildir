CNAME is the "canonical name" of a host. Not an alias. There is good
decriptions for the problem with this in the bat book. Basically it
breaks if your mailer expects one host on the other side (mail.foo.org) 
and suddently the host reports as mail.bar.org). The sender is
allowed to assume that the name reported after the "220" greeting
matches the name in the MX. This is impossible with a CNAME:
mail.foo.org.   IN A 1.2.3.4
mail.bar.org.   IN CNAME mail.foo.org.
bar.org.        IN MX 10 mail.bar.org.
% telnet mail.bar.org smtp
220 mail.foo.org ESMTP ready
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
This kills loop detection. Yes, it is done this way =%-) and it breaks
if done wrong.
