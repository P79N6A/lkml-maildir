I always found it pretty reasonable that the loopback device does
everything twice - after all, it shows both what it sends and what
it receives (being loopback) - so any packet you send should end up
showing once as being sent, and once as being received. And both would look
exactly the same in the logs.
I've been using a little awk script to get rid of the doubled lines when
I needed to, by the way.
What I'm curious about is which version of tcpdump you are using. As far as
I know, stock tcpdump versions can't log the loopback device at all, due to
a bug in the libpcap library.
