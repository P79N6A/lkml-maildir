I'm about writing a I2C bus adapter driver and wondering if it worth
to use interrupt for transfering data on the bus or just polling is
good enough ?
My hardware has a 8 bytes fifo for both Tx/Rx. It can generates
an interrupt when Tx fifo is empty and Rx fifo is not empty, 
actually like any UARTs. My CPU speed is 96 Mhz.
Thanks for your advices
Francis
