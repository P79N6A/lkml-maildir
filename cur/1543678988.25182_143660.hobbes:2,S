[PATCH 2.4.22-BK] [RESEND 3rd] Fix oom killer braindamage
Date: 21.06.2003 22:04

Linux Kernel)

Hi Marcelo,
attached patch fixes the oom killer braindamage where it tries to kill 
processes again and again and again w/o any ending or successfull killing of 
the selected processes in an OOM case.
The attached, very simple but effective, patch fixes it.
All the kudos go to Rik van Riel.
Patch tested and works, and also for a long time in my tree (and maybe also 
others?!)
This issue is out there for several years.
Please apply it for 2.4.22-pre2, thanks.

ciao, Marc
