must be a limit in your version of ifconfig.

I can raise 1000 interfaces in 1.6 seconds with 2.4.8 on a 500MHz PIII using my
custom written ifconfig program designed for raising a batch of IPS in one go.
I've actually got up to about 64000 IPs on one interface but performance
degrades rapidly after about 8000 probably due to the kernel ip hash size - i
didn't try any higher than this. Anybody wanting more than a Class B of ip
aliases on one machine has gotta have some sort of problem so I don't think its
really an issue.
# time ./vifup -q -f ip.list internal

It does need to. The kernel ioctl SIOCGIFCONF only lets you fetch info for all
interfaces so you have to search through the whole lot to find the ones your
interested in. This is a standard BSD interface - or is there a new interface
used by ip??.
