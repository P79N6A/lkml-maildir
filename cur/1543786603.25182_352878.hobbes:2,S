And especially keep in mind, that libata has practically *no*
built-in error-handling or recovery mechanisms yet.  If a drive
gets into a "reset me to recover" state, then libata just might
require a reboot to recover, whereas the IDE subsystem will usually
try a reset operation at some point.
Not a problem with modern, mostly bug-free hardware (eg. most SATA),
but this could be an issue for some PATA interfaces.
