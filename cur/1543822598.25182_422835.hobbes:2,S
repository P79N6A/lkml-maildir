There may be no devices with randomness in 10msec ...
... but how about the *count* of events during 10msec?
Keyboard presses may be observable from outside, but disk accesses, network 
interrupts, mouse moves etc. .... especially if the (outside) accesses have 
to be correlated to the (internal) timer interrupt.
Get the count of events in 10msec, take the lowest bit. In 1.28 seconds you'll 
get your 128bit key.
Or, to be conservative, take only the XOR of 8 consecutive bits ... then 
you'll have to wait 10 seconds, but will be a bit more secure.
Such a mechanism could even be used on machines with TSC ... just do an 
(non-locked) increment of some counter, reset it on every jiffie, and take a 
bit of entropy.
How about that?

Phil
