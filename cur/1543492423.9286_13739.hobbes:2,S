I think we need to be able to set capabilities on a per user and per
executable basis.  This should not be hard:  Simply `and' the capabilities
masks of the user and the program they're trying to execute.  I personally
favor setting capabilities in the filesystem, but that they only are useful 
on files set executable.
For instance, a user might have the capability set that allows him to access
graphics memory.  But he might not want a particular program that he runs to
have that same capability.
