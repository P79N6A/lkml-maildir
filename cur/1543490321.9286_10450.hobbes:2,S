Uhhuh.  I was lucky too, but when I heard it had been withdrawn I shelved
plans to fully install it until the problem is resolved.  (Right now I've
copied the minimal files needed to get HP's binary-only WebJetAdmin to run
without disturbing anything else.  Then I discovered that WJA is awful so
I guess I should remove 2.x altogether.)  Anybody wanna tell me where I
should go to discuss this, since it's (hint) not a kernel issue?
