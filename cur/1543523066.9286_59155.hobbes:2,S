On that general subject, right now the only way to send generic ATAPI
commands is to have ide-scsi on that interface, and nothing else.
This makes it extremely hard to use.
Either we should *always* send IDE commands through the SCSI subsystem
(effectively treating IDE as a form of SCSI; I believe NT does this)
or I'd like to see a way to issue generic ATAPI commands --
preferrably via a "generic ATAPI device" analogous to what SCSI has
(and parport IDE, I belive) -- i.e. /dev/hg0 et al -- or via an
ioctl().
There probably also should be an ioctl() for the cooked SCSI and IDE
devices to find the equivalent generic device.
