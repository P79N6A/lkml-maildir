Once you've loosed your beast upon the tree, I'd suggest that you
very carefully look through the resulting diff for inappropriate
corrections and redact the unnecessary hunks.  In the spelling fixes
which I sent to Linus, I redacted hunks which didn't need fixing.  For
example, Linus making fun of Sun folks' ability to spell, etc. and some
comments in French or German for which the spelling was correct in those
languages.
In addition to making fixes in the comments in the source, all of
Documentation should be fair game.
Then you'll have to contend with the folks whose out-of-tree patches
you've borked.
