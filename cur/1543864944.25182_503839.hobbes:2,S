Subject: [PATCH] x86_64 32-bit ptrace mangles sixth system call argument

[ This is -mm only until Andi acks it ]
The 32-bit sysenter entry point mangles the sixth system call argument
for both 32-bit and 64-bit ptrace.  In both cases, strace shows the
frame pointer (ebp) as the sixth argument.
Here's a snippet of a 64-bit strace of a 32-bit test program which
calls mmap through sysenter:
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0xfff00fcc) = 0xfffffffff7f7a000
fstat64(0x1, 0xfff008d8)                = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0xfff0089c) = 0xfffffffff7f79000
write(1, "mmap returns 0xf7f7a000\n", 24mmap returns 0xf7f7a000
) = 24
Here's a 32-bit strace of the same program:
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0xffc224ec) = 0xf7fcb000
fstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 1), ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0xffc21dbc) = 0xf7fca000
write(1, "mmap returns 0xf7fcb000\n", 24mmap returns 0xf7fcb000
) = 24
The first mmap is the one made by the test - its final argument (the
offset) is 0, but strace shows 0xfff00fcc, which is the value of ebp.
The second is a guilty bystander which is also showing the bug.
The patch below copies %r9 (where the sixth argument has been
stashed) into the RBP slot of pt_regs before syscall_trace_enter is
called.  This fixes ptrace.
To allow a successful return to userspace, the original value of rbp
must be restored.  This is done by storing the current value of rbp
into the RBP slot of pt_regs before the RESTORE_REST.
With this patch, the straces now look like this:
64-bit:
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xfffffffff7f5a000
fstat64(0x1, 0xff926ee8)                = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xfffffffff7f59000
write(1, "mmap returns 0xf7f5a000\n", 24mmap returns 0xf7f5a000
) = 24
32-bit:
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xf7fa9000
fstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 1), ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xf7fa8000
write(1, "mmap returns 0xf7fa9000\n", 24mmap returns 0xf7fa9000
) = 24
