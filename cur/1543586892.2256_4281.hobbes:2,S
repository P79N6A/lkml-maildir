ev6 works the way you described AFIK (to flush the write buffer you can use
wmb(), note that wmb() semantics doesn't require the cpu to really "flush" but
just to keep writes oredered across other mb or wmb, but it's basically the
same from a software point of you and flushing the write buffer synchronously
obviously provides that semantics).  I didn't followed very closely the
previous part of the thread so I'm not sure what is the issue.
