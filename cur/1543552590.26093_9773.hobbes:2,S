Wonderful, so I can hope for a good solution soon :-) 
BTW (for Jens): I noticed some other removable device problems 
with devfs as well: When a CD-ROM module is removed and reloaded,
the /dev/cdroms/cdrom? symlink disappears to reappear with a different 
(higher) number attached. 
This killed my wonderful automount system and forces me to enter the 
full /dev/ide/[...]/cd path in my fstab.
This problem seems to be in the generic cdrom layer: 
(in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:
int register_cdrom(struct cdrom_device_info *cdi)
{
	[...]
	static unsigned int cdrom_counter;
	
	[...]
	sprintf(vname, "cdrom%u", cdrom_counter++);
	[...]
}
After some further testing, It seems to me that the device layer really
isn't doing to well being confronted with removable media or modules.
Something should be done here IMHO, I still can't say what exactly. 
Some ideas here: 
* autonotification of media changes to the driver layer, which would for
example 
  create the required partition entries for partitioned removable media
* more consistent interface to removable media, across IDE/SCSI/whatever
  boundaries - the unified cdrom driver is a nice example here, which
could
  be extended to a more general "removable media" layer, including
floppy disks.
* Options for autoeject on unmount, I'd really love this feature for our
PowerMac,
  where I always have to use "eject" to spit out a CD-ROM or floppy disk
(... no,
  Macs don't have an eject knob on their drives!)
* ...
Everything probably not a 2.4 thing :-) But I'd like to help
implementing any
of these, as far as time permits. And I suggest further advice from the
more
experienced gurus here...
Greetings,
Andreas
