-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Mike Miller <mike.miller@hp.com>
This patch fixes a stupid bug. Sometime during the 2tb enhancement I ended up
replacing the macros XFER_READ and XFER_WRITE with h->cciss_read and
h->cciss_write respectively. It seemed to work somehow at least on x86_64 and
ia64. I don't know how. But people started complaining about command timeouts
on older controllers like the 64xx series and only on ia32. This resolves the
issue reproduced in our lab. Please consider this for inclusion.
