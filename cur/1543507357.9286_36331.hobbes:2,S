Hi,
This is the first time I mail a question to linux-kernel mailing list.
One of the kernel source, fs/nfsd/vfs.c issues 
fh_verfify://<login_name> permission failure ac=1; err=3
whenever a user at the client side opens a shell.
Is it normal?  It seems there is nothing wrong with the system 
even with the above error message.  But, it is very annoying.
And I am concerned in fact.  This behavior has been going on 
since kernel 2.2.1.
Thank you.
