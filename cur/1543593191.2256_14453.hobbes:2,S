altroot should be buried, not generalized. It was a mistake and
we will be better off forgetting about that nightmare instead of
trying to design something around it.
Absolute symlinks... Dunno. _If_ we want that at all, we probably
want it on per-mountpoint basis. However, that opens a door to
_really_ ugly feature requests. E.g. "if symlink starts with
/foo - replace it with /mnt/bar, but if it starts with /foo/baz -
replace with /mnt/splat instead".
I can see how to implement per-mountpoint variant. However, I'm
less than enthusiastic about the API side of that and about the
ugliness it will lead to. It smells like a wrong approach. And
no, I don't see a good one right now.
As for the API... How would you pass that option? Yet another
mount(2) argument?
