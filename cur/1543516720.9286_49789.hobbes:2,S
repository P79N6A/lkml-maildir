RTC regulation is a BIOS functionnality.It often updates RTC
datas every 30 sec or so. _but_ Linux ought modify the stuff by itself.
That's true some machines won't update RTC automagically but I think
it has been patched.

We need that stuff but also, for Y2K instance, some program
comparing OS - BIOS - RTC date in RT so we can incriminate the right
side.
