Did you mean:
Server is the data source.
Client is the data sink.
netconsole.o is the server (data source)
netconsole listener is the client (data sink)
Or did you mean:
Server is the part that offers a service
Client is the part that uses the service
netconsole listener offers the "receive console messages" service -> server
netconsole.o uses the "receive console message" service -> client
So both definitions are right/wrong. Choose any you like. Just
document it and stick to it. =:-) 
I am happy to have a network console no matter what is the client and
what is the server.
I personally, would say, that if you have a "one - many" network
relation, then the "one" part is the server. So in this case, the
netconsole listener would be the server and the netconsole.o the
client(s). Which is like syslog and so conforms to the "principle of
least surprise". :-)
Or can you have multiple listeners to a single netconsole.o instance?
