As jeff said, this needs to become a return SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY.

It depends on how the controller behaves.  Setting can_queue and
cmd_per_lun tends to work for most SCSI controllers because the actual
scsi devices have queue depths << this number.  If your controller will
behave like this (i.e. will not allow the internal queue for a single
lun to fill up to this depth) then you can keep this setting (although,
again, since this is probably fixed by the firmware, you want to set
cmd_per_lun to this value to avoid excessive QUEUE_FULL returns).  If
the controller will happily load all the available slots up for a single
lun, then you might want to think about reducing cmd_per_lun to some
fraction of can_queue (you could even set it to can_queue - 2 like the
3ware controller).
Most of the other actual raid controllers seem to have much smaller
per-lun queues, so they mainly set smaller, fixed size values for
cmd_per_lun.
