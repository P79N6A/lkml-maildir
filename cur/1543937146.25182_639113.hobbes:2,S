I haven't tested yet, but we looked at that one earlier and I thought
it was ok because 
#define __PHYSICAL_MASK          _AT(phys_addr_t, (_AC(1,ULL) << __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT) - 1)
and 
typedef u64     phys_addr_t;
for PAE. So the expression above should have been already 64bit.

That would mean it is 32bit again because 32bit long is 32bit, but on 32bit 
PAE PTE_MASK definitely needs to be 64bit.
So I would be surprised if the patch works.
The problem seems to be rather that PAGE_MASK does not include the bits above 32bit. 
Something like
#define PHYSICAL_PAGE_MASK (__PHYSICAL_MASK & ~(phys_addr_t)(PAGE_SIZE-1))
should work (untested)
