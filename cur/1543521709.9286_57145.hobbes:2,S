It has a price anyway, in terms of compiler instability, size, missed
optimizations, bugs and nonportability caused by misuse, ...

Then Kerberos is broken. IP addresses are 128 bits, you know ;-)
Adding "gimme exactly 36 bits worth of signed foo" won't make people write
portable programs all of a sudden. I fear exactly the opposite, in fact.
Think of somebody working on a DEC 10...

Or even better, by using "struct sockaddr_in" et al. That way it has a
fighting chance to survive to IPv6. With "int foo:32" it has none
whatsoever.
