I think most of the "we want to disable plugging" behaviour stems
from the way task queues behave. Once somebody starts a tq_disk
run, the list is fried and walked one by one. Both old loop
and nbd drop the io_request_lock and block, possibly waiting
for I/O to be done (at least the loop case, don't know about
ndb). But this I/O won't be done just because the target plug every
now and then just happens to be queued behind the nbd/loop one and a new
tq_disk run won't start it.
