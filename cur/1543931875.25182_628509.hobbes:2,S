An inb is annoying in that it clobbers register al (well, with an inline 
native_io_delay it is at least) and more importantly -- the timing of this 
is going to vary wildly. We really want a register that is effectively 
guaranteed to be unused so that it dies on ISA/LPC or we might get _much_ 
faster PCI only decodes. Even reading port 0x80 itself varies wildly:

It's really going to have to be a known _un_used register and (the write 
direction of) port 0x80 is used exactly for that reason. Port 0xed is a 
known "alternate diagnostic port" used by Phoenix BIOSes at least but Peter 
Anvin reported trouble with that one -- probably for the outb direction but 
assuming that means something was in fact responding, we'd have the same 
timing problem.
I believe we have two "good" options:
1) port 0xed was tested by the current reporter and found to be safe (and 
provide slow enough timing). If DMI  based quirk hacks are available soon 
enough we can switch 0x80 to 0xed based on it. Are they?
2) the thing I posted in the message replied to where immediately after 
tsc_init() (which is before the PIT init) we switch to udelay() if we have a 
TSC which is ofcourse anything modern.
