Hi,
I finally finished to fix bugs WRT kernel 2.4 of the 
Tekram DC390 / AM53C974 / tmscsim SCSI driver.
Therefore, I released the version 2.0f, which you may find on
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/dc390/
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/garloff/linux/dc390/
The driver should work better than ever since with both 2.2 and 2.4 
kernels. (Maybe even 2.0, I didn't test.)
I'd be glad to get some feedback. If it's positive, I'll ask Alan and
Linus to put it into the mainstream kernel.
Regards,
