In userspace, it's definitely easier to stick with BE for a standard 
byte order, simply because it's the one byteorder one can rely on there 
being macros available to deal with on all platforms.
However, then I would also like to suggest replacing "unsigned int" and 
"unsigned short" with uint32_t and uint16_t, even though they're 
consistent on all *current* Linux platforms.
