Well, my spellchecker rejects the -se but recognizes the -ze. It also has no 
problems with journaled.

Sure. But that only proves my point: once something has been accepted as 
common language and a term, however technically wrong, is recognized to 
stand for something by the majority of existing users, it is probably wrong 
to change it. After all, language is a living and evolving thing. This is 
exactly how new words, terms and simplifications are introduced.
Google clearly shows that journaled is the accepted, and thus preferred 
term. Maybe if you'd proposed this patch (and others everywhere else 
journaled has been used) 5 years ago you'd been right. At this stage I 
think a change would only confuse.
