The Linux-PowerEdge@dell.com list may be more appropriate for this
type of question.  Subscribe at

For the Red Hat kernel you mention, you want /etc/modules to list the
megaraid_2002 driver, not plain megaraid.  Then remake your initial
ramdisk such that the megaraid_2002 driver gets picked up and used at
next boot.
Thanks,
Matt
