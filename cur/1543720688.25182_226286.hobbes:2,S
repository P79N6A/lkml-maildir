Hi List,
I'm trying to get a SA431 smart array controller working with my Alpha.
Dmesg (2.6.6) shows:
cpqarray ida0: idaSendPciCmd FIFO full, waiting!
....
<near endless loop of the same message>
....
cpqarray ida0: idaSendPciCmd FIFO full, waiting!
cpqarray ida0: idaSendPciCmd Timeout out, No command list address
returned! cpqarray: error sending ID controller
lspci:
00:06.0 RAID bus controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21554
(rev 01)        Subsystem: Compaq Computer Corporation Integrated Smart
Array        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 16
        Memory at 000000000a874000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        I/O ports at 8000 [size=256]
        Expansion ROM at 000000000a800000 [disabled] [size=256K]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 2
        Capabilities: [e4] Slot ID: 0 slots, First-, chassis 00
        Capabilities: [ec] #06 [0080]
Does this controller not work with an Alpha?
Thanks and greetings
Marc
