	My thanks to David Hopwood for providing me with the definitive refutation
of this position. The response is that the as-if rules allows the
implementation to violate the specification internally provided no compliant
application could tell the difference.
	When you call 'pthread_mutex_lock', there is no guarantee regarding how
long it will or might take until you are actually waiting for the mutex. So
no conforming application can ever tell whether or not it is waiting for the
mutex or about to wait for the mutex.
	So you cannot write an application that can tell the difference.
	His exact quote is, "It could have been the case that the other threads ran
more slowly, so that they didn't reach the point of blocking on the mutex
before the pthread_mutex_unlock()."
	You can find it on comp.programming.threads if you like.
	DS
