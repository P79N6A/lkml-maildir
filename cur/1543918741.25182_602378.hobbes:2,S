How does Joe Sysadmin tell if he has an affected legacy app or not?
(The obvious "try it and see what breaks" is a non-starter for many places,
because you too easily end up in a loop of "enable it, find 4-5 show stoppers,
turn it off, fix them, lather rinse repease".  Been there, done that, got
the tshirt - a project I got dragged into involves a large storage array that
appears to insist on exporting 64-bit stuff, and a large farm of clients that
are very 64-bit unclean....)
