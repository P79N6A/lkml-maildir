Guess what ? I hate it too when others do it, but I often think that
my mail will be a one-liner which will be easier to read this way, and
of course I'm wrong. Nice FAQ BTW.

OK, I have a free account on a ppc64 machine in case I cannot reproduce
on anything else.

I see it. I've done the ulong magic only on the constant computation,
while in theory, I should have casted m to ulong before the comparison
because m is implicitly casted to ulong in the return (common type).
In practise, it should be better to cast MAX_MSEC_OFFSET to unsigned int
in the comparison, but there's still a risk of warning if MAX_MSEC_OFFSET
becomes equal to ~0.
I'll makes a few tests and check that gcc is smart enough to remove the
cast code when unneeded if I cast m to ulong.
Thanks for the details,
Willy
