I've been trying to rip my CDs onto my HD, and last night after about 7 
CDs I realized I was getting junk and it was taking forever to rip a 
CD.  I'm using 2.6.8-rc2 and I have two different CD-ROMs in my 
machine.  Both are burners.
I got a single "cdrom: dropping to single frame dma" message which 
according to my research is part of the culprit.
See the thread on LKML back on 5/15/2004 titled "dma ripping", and again 
on 6/15 titled "cdrom ripping / dropping to dingle frame dma" -- yes 
that's a "d".
I'm guessing that Jens' patch for this didn't make it into the kernel.
