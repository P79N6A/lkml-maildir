At least some of those you don't have to kmap ... at least not in
the traditional sense. This sort of thing is a good application
for the per-process (or per-task) kernel virtual address area.
you just map in the stuff you need for your own task, instead
of having to share the global space with everybody. Some things
have to be global (well, easier at least) like the task_struct,
but the kernel stacks could be moved out with a little work,
files, vm_area_structs, etc.
That sounds more appealing to me than either kmap or a 4G/4G split.
