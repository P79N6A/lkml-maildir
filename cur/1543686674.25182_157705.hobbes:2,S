Yes, I tried reading. You said Linux doesn't panic while using ACPI, so
I supposed ACPI just worked but the problem was you wanted APM support.

It's not a problem with dependencies. On ACPI-enabled kernels, you using
ACPI routing. If you boot using "acpi=off", then you're using standard
PCI routing and that, in turn, on same machines, it warns you to use
"pci=usepirqmask". Don't know why, on some machines using standard PCI
routing, you don't need to boot with "pci=usepirqmask". I suppose it
will be some kind of hardware incompatibility or a bad implementation.
