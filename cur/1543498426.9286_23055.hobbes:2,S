I've tried various configuration options.  Here is the last set I tried.
This is different from the previous set, which I showed the boot messages
for in that I've disabled the SMP support.  However, I haven't returned 
home yet to see if disabling the SMP support has any effect.  (I think
it was on by default, and since I didn't think it was harmful I didn't
configure it to be off.)
