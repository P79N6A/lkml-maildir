You didn't upset me.  I just wanted to ensure that an inacurate statement
wasn't propogated.

Yes and no.  Although more common in older hardware, there are still
companies that bring new products to market that take *forever* to
wakeup after a bus reset.

There are still lots of devices out there that don't work with shorter
timeouts.  I don't know that it matters what percentage of people have
these devices so much as allowing them to install/use the OS without
the frustration of trying to figure out how to make their system work.
Other than a bit of wall clock time, the extra delay does not "hurt"
setups that can use a lower timeout.
