Not exactly a FAQ answer though.  How about:
The error would appear to be benign.  Something in the protocol stack is
not setting one of the header fields correctly and this code has corrected
the fault.
This error is only seen when running network monitoring software such as
tcpdump as that is the only time the particular code path that detects
the error is followed.
Also shouldn't that be:
