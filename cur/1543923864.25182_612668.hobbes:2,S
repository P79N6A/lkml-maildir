It shouldn't. It should just fail when it fails. Then, handle_mm_fault() 
should return an error code, which should cause get_user_pages() to return 
an error code. Which should make ptrace just stop.
So I think your patch is wrong. mm/filemap.c should *not* care about who 
does the fault.  I think the proper patch is something untested like the 
appended...

It's also wrong. They shouldn't be in the page cache, since that can cause 
problems with truncate etc. Maybe it doesn't any more, but it's reasonable 
to believe that a page outside of i_size should not exist.

access_process_vm() should just return how many bytes it could fill (which 
means a truncated copy - very including zero bytes - for an error), and 
the caller should decide what the right thing to do is.
But who knows, maybe I missed something.
Duane? Does this fix things for you?
