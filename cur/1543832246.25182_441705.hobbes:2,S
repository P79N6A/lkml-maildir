	Works for me. I've been working on patches for Andrew's multi-chain
proposal and I could use an init function there anyway. Should be faster
too -- dynamically-allocated per-cpu memory can take advantage of
node-local memory whereas, to my knowledge, statically-allocated cannot.

Yes, it is an excellent example.
