The Linux 2.5.57 tarball has the 1.7 version of the i8k driver, but
the version in 
http://people.debian.org/~dz/i8k/i8kutils-1.17.tar.bz2
is version 1.13.  A quick diff doesn't show anything that would prevent
a drop-in of the 1.13 version.  What's the protocol to get this
synced to the latest-and-greatest?
