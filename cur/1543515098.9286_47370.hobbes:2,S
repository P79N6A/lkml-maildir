Subject: ext2 filesystem corruption - resources?

I have let fsck sort out the problems since 0.98 days but now am faced
with
loss of some serious data due to a dodgy memory stick.
I'd like to make a serious stab at low level recovery but beyond
e2fsprogs I cannot
find any resources on the subject - I thought there might be something
outlining a
practical approach or strategy. After playing with debugfs and looking
at the repair work
done by fsck on my data, I cannot see how I could get the same result
with the former.
Can anyone point me in the direction of a resource?
Thanks...
Chris Q.
