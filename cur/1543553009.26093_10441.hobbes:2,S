If I can only get 128k bytes of RAM that is still present during
an interrupt, because of a kmalloc() limitation, then I need to
allocate multiple buffers and keep their pointers in a list, right?
It doesn't actually have to be a linked list, the buffers are
never deallocated until the module is removed.
	char *ram_128k[16];
16 buffers with 128k in each.
In the interrupt, I just write to the previously-allocated 16 buffers.
In the read(), I just read from them.
Cheers,
