The fs driver should ensure that any userspace access to the
filesystem/pagecache should behave as if no prepare_write were
called at all.
That includes deallocating or zeroing any potentially allocated
but uninitialized blocks so they won't get read in from disk in future.
But that isn't handled properly yet though, so we can probably solve
that in the core kernel rather than your filesystem. Discussion about
this should go to the new mail I've just posted.

Yes I see, after reading it a bit. I'll take a look at it and try
to work out if anything needs fixing.
Thanks,
