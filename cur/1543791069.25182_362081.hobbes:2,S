Yeah, I considered this. But there is a precedent for such duplication,
and as yet there is no common header file. So it does not belong in this
particular patch... not to say it is without merit though.
The arch maintainers I talked to generally didn't think it was a really
pressing issue, so I think I would leave such a consolidation patch for
someone else.
