Wrong again.
If a piece of code was merged into the kernel with a GPL v1 "or later"
license then it still has a GPL v1 "or later" license.  The "or later"
makes it compatible with the v2 code but does not change the fundamental
copyright on the original work that was combined. Thus if you could
identify specifically a GPL v1 work within the kernel you could use that
GPL v1 work as per GPL v1 providing you didn't mix it with v2 code.
If I take a public domain book and create a derivative work from it the
original work does not magically become restricted.
