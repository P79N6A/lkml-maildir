You mean to keep the copy for the next two tries?

I was a bit scared of grabing the lock anyway, because that's another
cache hit (write side). So only grabbing the lock when needed would save
us from dirting the runqueue lock for each CPU.

Yes indeed. The aim for now is to solve the latencies that you've been
seeing. But really, there is still holes (small ones) that can cause a
latency if a schedule happened "just right". Hopefully the final result of
this work will close them too.
