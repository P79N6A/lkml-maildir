The current x86 code maps the logical cpus as with the physical ones. In
other words its how they come off the mainboard. Which for HT seems to
be with each HT as (n, n+1)

I never saw your stuff.

A mailing list doesn't scale to that. I do have a cunning-plan (tm) but
that requires some work and while its doable for 2.2 or 2.4 I know that
making Linus do or change any tiny bit of his behaviour isn't going to
happen which rather limits the behaviour.
Think about
	mail patch to linus-patches@...
	linus-patches@ is a script that does
		find the diff
		find the paths in the diff
		regexp them against the list of notifications
			email each matching notification a copy
with the regexps including
	*	torvalds@transmeta.com
so its like mailing Linus but anyone who cares can web add/remove themselves
from the cc list, and its invisible to Linus too.

Well actually Alchemy is MIPS and nothing to do with me. Trying to turn a
Voodoo card into a video4linux overlay is, Zen is ftp.linux.org.uk and I
hack card drivers. So 3 out of 4.
