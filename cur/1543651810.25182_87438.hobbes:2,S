Yep. This is what I was briefly trying to explain in the announcement. With 
initramfs stuff finally going into 2.5, root-on-complex-volume should become 
far less of an issue. For our users on 2.4, we will have to help them wade 
through initrd for the time being. My real hope is that initramfs will 
provide a much simpler method (compared to initrd) for adding new tools, 
scripts, etc to be run during early userspace. The info I've gathered about 
it so far seems to indicate this will be the case.

Hopefully, yes. We will obviously want to take full advantage of hotplug, and 
any other device-level services that are available.
