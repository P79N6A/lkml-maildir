Subject: Duplicate FM synth config options

This is really quite trivial, but in the kernel config options for
sound, the following lines:
Generic OPL2/OPL3 FM synthesizer support         (CONFIG_SOUND_ADLIB)
FM synthesizer (YM3812/OPL-3) support            (CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812)
appear to do exactly the same thing (looking at the makefile).
This had me a bit confused until I looked closer. Could someone remove
one of them? Or if they are different, explain why?
Thanks,
