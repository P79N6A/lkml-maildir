I don't think Gautham cares about cpufreq-vs-hotplug per-se.  He cares
about the crappy cpufreq code and the warnings it emits.

Gautham's work is "add lots of complex machinery so cpufreq's existing crap
works as it was supposed to".  We end up with complex machinery as well as
crappy cpufreq.
The alternative is to rip all that stuff out of cpufreq and then go back
and reimplement cpufreq cpu-hotplug safety from scratch.

afaik the warnings are the only symptom.
