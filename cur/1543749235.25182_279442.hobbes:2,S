OOM killing is known to be broken in 2.6.9, specifically it kills things 
even when the machine isn't out of memeory and/or kills the "wrong" 
things when it is. See threads assim for more details.
The OOM Killer is working properly again in 2.6.10-rc2-mm4. Could you 
try that kernel and report whether it fixed your problems too?
