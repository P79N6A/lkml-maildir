It would be a bug.
In the case of truncate(), the filesystem has to decide if the file size
will actually change. If it does, then it has to update mtime/ctime. In
the case of ftruncate(), it would appear that the filesystem always has
to update mtime/ctime on success, so it is appropriate to call
do_truncate with ATTR_MTIME/ATTR_CTIME.
