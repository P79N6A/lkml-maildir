Hi
I´d like to do some source to do Process Migration with two linux , with 
socket.
But i am not sure if i can construct another task struct on Linux A , with 
information of Linux B and send this with socket for Linux A . So , with this 
i would like to continue run the process (of linux B) on Linux A.
Please , somebody , i´d like to know if this is possible , and what the 
informations i need send with socket to construct the same process , and 
continue to run on another machine.
Breno
