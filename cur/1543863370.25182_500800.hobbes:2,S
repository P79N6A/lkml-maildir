That comment most certainly is 100% incorrect.  The following:
static char foo[16];
has a well defined value when you read from it before writing to it.
If you think otherwise, suggest you read any specification of the C
language.

That wasn't my point.
Anyway, here's what the GCC manual has to say about use of
__attribute__((section)) on variables:
`section ("SECTION-NAME")'
     Use the `section' attribute with an _initialized_ definition of a
     _global_ variable, as shown in the example.  GCC issues a warning
     and otherwise ignores the `section' attribute in uninitialized
     variable declarations.
     You may only use the `section' attribute with a fully initialized
     global definition because of the way linkers work.  The linker
     requires each object be defined once, with the exception that
     uninitialized variables tentatively go in the `common' (or `bss')
     section and can be multiply "defined".  You can force a variable
     to be initialized with the `-fno-common' flag or the `nocommon'
     attribute.
which reflects precisely what I've been saying concerning the addition
of __initdata.
