Note that i talked about the core kernel (kernel/*.c) specifically.

Core kernel developers tend to be quite inline-conscious and generally do 
not believe that making something inline will make it go faster.
That's why i picked kernel/built-in.o as a good "best of breed" entity to 
measure - if then that is an area where we have at least the chance to do 
a "kernel coders know best when to inline" manual inlining job.
But despite a decade of tuning and systematic effort in that area, the 
numbers suggest that we dont. (if someone has different numbers or 
different interpretation, please share it with us.)
My goal is to make the kernel smaller and faster, and as far as the 
placement of 'inline' keywords goes, i dont have too strong feelings about 
how it's achieved: they have a certain level of documentation value 
[signalling that a function is _intended_ to be lightweight] but otherwise 
they are pretty neutral attributes to me.
So we want all the mechanisms in place to constantly press towards a 
smaller and faster kernel, with the most efficient use of development 
resources. Some techniques work in practice despite looking problematic, 
some dont, despite looking good on paper.
This might be one of those cases. Or not :-)
