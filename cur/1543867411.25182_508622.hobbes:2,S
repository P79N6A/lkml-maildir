You did not time to do the full audit, so you just did #define.

And here you claim you could not do the right thing, because people
would notice you are doing huge search/replace without audit, and
would stop you. So you simply hidden it from them :-(.
Plus... udelay() should just work under virtualization, right? You get
slightly slower kernel, but still working, so the "full audit" is not
as hard as you are telling me.
Just replace udelay() with hardware_udelay() on places that matter in
your workload...
