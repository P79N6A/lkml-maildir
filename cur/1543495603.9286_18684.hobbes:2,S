hadn't seen a recent version of your patch... but that sounds like a good
design.

correct, there are no changes in getblk() 2.2.7 -> 2.2.8.  however, if
flushtime is no longer relevant, then this piece of code is now
unnecessary:
        bh = get_hash_table(dev, block, size);
        if (bh) {
-               if (!buffer_dirty(bh)) {
-                       bh->b_flushtime = 0;
-               }
                return bh;
        }
in fact, under most circumstances, this code is exercised relatively
rarely, compared to the rate that getblk() is called. so this might be
even cooler:
	bh = find_buffer(dev, block, size);
	if (bh) {
		bh->b_count++;
		return bh;
	}
but i don't know what that might do to maintainability; there is a cryptic
comment next to get_hash_table() about avoiding race conditions, so
somehow this bit of code may need to change if get_hash_table() ever
changes.

i've been waiting for some of the recent flurry to die down, but it seems
that there's still a change in 2.2.8 that is throttling performance.  when
that is resolved, i will try another benchmark.
