I know that the objective has always been to keep the list "open post" to allow
bug reports from the world. So aside from applying a high-speed clue stick and
dropping the 12 ton Lart rock... why not use web forms all over the net which
post using a valid address? I'd be willing to donate a page and I already have a
script and I'd be willing to bet that there'd be a few hundred others willing
to do the same. The list would probably still get a "crap" posting from time to
time but it would definitely prevent what's happening now.
