This sounds slightly tinderboxy in Mozilla slang, perhaps that is an idea?
I know Ben (I think?) has a .config that currently compiles with 2.5 but
also includes almost everything that is working right now and so quickly
exposes stuff that breaks.
Perhaps we could set up a tinderbox like thing to autmatically assign 'BK
blame'.
