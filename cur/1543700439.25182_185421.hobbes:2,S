Are you saying that there's code in the kernel that is subject to your
patent?
If there is, then it should definitely be taken out. First, as Linus
has stated recently (and as has been the policy for a while), the
kernel should avoid having any patented code
(
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0312.2/0624.html
).
Second, "RTLinux Free" is being ported over to Adeos
(

).
