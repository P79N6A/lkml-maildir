	BTW. 
	Question was poping in my mind and finally got negative answer by my mind ;-)
	Is it possible to make somethis like:
	char a[100] = {...}
	char b[100] = {...}
	char c[100];
	char d[100];
	
	1: { // run this on first CPU
		for (int i=0; i<100; i++) c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
	};
	2: { // run this on any other CPU
		for (int i=0; i<100; i++) d[i] = a[i] * b[i];
	};
	
	...
	// do something else...
	...
	
	wait 1,2; // to be sure c[] and d[] are ready.
	what was popping in my mind - some prefix (like 0x66 Intel used for 32
instructions) to say this instruction should run on other CPU?
	I know - stupid idea. Too many questions will arise. 
	If we will do 
	PREFIX jmp far some_routing
	and this routing will run on other CPU not blocking current execution thread.
	(who will clean stack? when?.. question without answers...)
	Is there anything like this in computerworld? I heard about old computers that
have a speacial instruction set to implicit run code on given processor.
	Is it possible to emulate this behavior on PCs?begin:vcard
