sure. I guess it would be most important to be allowed to leave
anticipatory scheduling enabled *always* even with very async-io
intensive workloads, so when you read a file with normal fileutiles you
still can take advantage of it for the most important places. Ideally in
this case where w/o the hint we might have to disable anticipatory
scheduling completely to get peak async-io performance, the non-hint
timeout could be zero (i.e. no stall at all) and the kernel would
understand and do the right thing
