No.  All three instances were english typos.

No.  All three instances were english typos.

That may be, but in the neologism, it seems to be usually partially capitalized,
and the C source sure looks like just a typo:
/* producer/comsumer pointers for Tx/Rx ring */

Allan said it was a copy/paste error and should be fixed.

You be the judge:
      /* Initiliaze Transmit/Receive decriptor and CR3/4 */
All instances I saw were just english typos.

Where I spot-checked it, it was always just an English typo.

Thanks, fixed!

Yes.  These will have to be hand-reviewed.  I do recommend absolutely
every change be hand-reviewed just in case.

You're right, though I had to dig to find a dictionary that agreed with you.
I've updated 
http://www.kegel.com/kerspell
 to remove the "signall*" and "writeable"
corrections.  (My stoplist already listed them as acceptable, fwiw.)
Thanks!
