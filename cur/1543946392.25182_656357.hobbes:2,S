I don't oppose the export, but it seems that using getledstate()
asynchronously could return out-of-sync info, while adding this info
to the notifier data would synchronize the info..

--- linux/drivers/char/keyboard.c.old
+++ linux/drivers/char/keyboard.c
is the preferred form.  (a) keep the top-level linux dir name.
(b) the +++ line has the correct file name.
