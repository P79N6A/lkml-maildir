/dev/urandom always leaves enough entropy in the input pool for
/dev/random to reseed. Thus, as long as entropy is coming in, it is
not possible for /dev/urandom readers to starve /dev/random readers.
But /dev/random readers may still block temporarily and they should
damn well expect to block if they read 500 bytes out of a 512 byte
pool.
