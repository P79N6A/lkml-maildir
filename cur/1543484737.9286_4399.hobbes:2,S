I've tried to have 2.2.1, with or without the IDE-UDMA patches, to use my
busmaster-capable IDE chipset.
It refuses:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.19
UM8886BF: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 91
UM8886BF: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
UM8886BF: dma_base is invalid (0x0000, BIOS problem), please report to
<mj@ucw.cz>
ide0: UM8886BF Bus-Master DMA disabled (BIOS)
UM8886BF: dma_base is invalid (0x0000, BIOS problem), please report to
<mj@ucw.cz>
ide1: UM8886BF Bus-Master DMA disabled (BIOS)
Now, there's NO switch in the BIOS that deals with UDMA. So there's no use
telling me "just fiddle with the BIOS settings". :-)
The /proc/pci entry for the IDE chipset is the following:
  Bus  0, device  18, function  1:
    IDE interface: UMC UM8886BF (rev 16).
      Fast devsel.  Master Capable.  No bursts.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x1f0 [0x1f0].
      Non-prefetchable unknown memory at 0x3f0 [0x3f6].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x170 [0x170].
      Non-prefetchable unknown memory at 0x370 [0x376].
