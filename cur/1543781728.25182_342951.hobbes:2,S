CONFIG_HZ is just a short term hack to placate people who insist on a
tick rate lower than 1000 but can't wait for dynamic tick to be ready.
Once dynamic tick is merged then CONFIG_HZ will need to go away.  We
don't impose arbitrary restrictions on the period of the soundcard
interrupt, I don't see why the PIT should be any different.
I would be quite disappointed if dynamic tick does not get merged for
2.6.14.
