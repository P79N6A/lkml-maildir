Yes, I know that; and there may even be mass storage systems with actual
realtime requirements.  Note though that latencies in FUSE-based
filesystems due to (what do I know) context switches and possibly CPU
scheduling latencies are not necessarily relevant to the overall
latencies in applications which you mentioned.
Anyway, that's not at all what the original poster alluded to when he
made vague statements about FUSE vs. kernelspace filesystems, finishing
in the odd comparison with ALSA.
