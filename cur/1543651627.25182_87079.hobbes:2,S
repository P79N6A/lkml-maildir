It is annoying to have to answer a lots of questions when running "make
oldconfig". This also makes your life a little difficult when you are
using the config file from an earlier kernel version to build a newer
kernel. You will get lots of questions to answer including questions for
the new features in the new kernel and you can no longer blindly answer
"N" to every question.
