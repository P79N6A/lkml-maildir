I think Andrew was suggesting a random key for the ADD function.

I think XOR might be even weaker than ADD, because from gessing the
difference between two values (easy) you might be able to guess the
bits of the key.
I'm actually looking for something stronger than XOR or ADD, but it's
all a bit academical I think, because even if userspace knows these
kernel pointers it can't really use them for any malicious purpose.
