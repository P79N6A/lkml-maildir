Of course I did and confirmed to get the segmentation fault
at those instructions.

I got the developer's manual from the following site.
ftp://download.intel.com/design/Pentium4/manuals/25366618.pdf
There is the description of "See also: Bit(BitBase, BitOffset) on page 3-10"
on the explanation of "bts" at page 3-82.
"Table 3-2. Range of Bit Positions Specified by Bit Offset Operands"
 at page 3-10 says that the register bit offset is restricted
from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
