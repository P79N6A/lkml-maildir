Well, there's already some code to do that (mm/numa.c), but I'm not sure
how applicable it will be to your arch.

I think we're something like 1.5:1, and we have machines with up to 256
nodes at the moment, so there can be quite a few hops in the worst case.

Depends on how big your node count gets I guess.

Yeah, classzones is one way to go about this.  There are some other simple
ways to do nearest node allocation though, given the current
codebase.  I'm still trying to figure out which is the most flexible.
