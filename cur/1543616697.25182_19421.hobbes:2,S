Actually, it's as good a benchmark as any. Knowing
how well the system is able to recover from heavy
overload situations is useful to know if your
server gets heavily overloaded at times.
If one VM falls over horribly under half the load
it takes to make another VM go slower, I know which
one I'd want on my server.

... and then you come up with something WAY less
realistic than 'make -j' ;)))
