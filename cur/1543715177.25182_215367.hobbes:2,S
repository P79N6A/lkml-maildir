Such probing can  only detect my touchscreen (and  many other devices)
as a PS2 mouse, due to  hardware emulation.  Why would I use Linux 2.6
if my touchscreen is degenerated into a mouse-emulating device?

Even so,  it's not easy to  get it right.  In  kernel programming, you
have to take  care of many issues, such as whether  you have a process
context, when to  use spinlock, wait queues, etc.  I  even had to care
about fasync() when developing the psaux module, even though it's just
copying a few lines of sample code from the kernel hacking guide.
If it  were in user space,  it would be  simpler: I just need  to open
/dev/psaux  (a la  2.4, 2.2,  2.0, 1.0.32(?)),  block-reading  a byte,
modify  the state  of  my state  machine  in the  program, and  output
something to  a repeater device  when needed.  No SMP  issues, fasync,
etc   (assuming  /dev/psaux   and   the  repeater   device  do   those
automagically).

Unfortunately,  it loses  data during  the conversion.   Moreover, the
current  /dev/psaux in  standard  2.6 kernel  DOES  NOT ALLOW  writing
command bytes  to the  PS2/AUX port, preventing  me from  enabling the
touchscreen behaviour  (disabling mouse emulation)  without any kernel
programming.  That's stupid.
IOW, the 2.6 kernel is implementing a policy, taking away flexibility.

There is still no provision for a userspace program to talk to the PS2
AUX port *directly*.  I don't want  my commands to be censored and the
data be translated.
