So I guess we need to look at why people want to stuff metadata in the page
cache. For me, I have a problem in NTFS that all metadata is stored in files,
and comes in chunks that can be multiples of the block size of the device/fs.
The current tiny prototype I have (started during the summer and then
forgotten about) was stuffing these in the page cache, on the grounds that
in practice metadata blocks never exceeded the page size, though I don't
believe this is set in stone.
