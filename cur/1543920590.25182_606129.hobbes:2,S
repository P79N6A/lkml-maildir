No, it's in Len's git tree.
Len's git-pull request from a few days ago didn't work, perhaps because I
wanted to know if a recent -mm regression had been fixed and that hasn't
been answered yet.  I assume that Len is offline.  Other acpi developers
could presumably have answered that question but for some reason chose not to.
I'm presently holding off 20-odd power management patches due to their
dependency upon an acpi merge...
