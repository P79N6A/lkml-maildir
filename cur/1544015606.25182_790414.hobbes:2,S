Hmm.
If I call unlink() a thousand times and then call fsync() on the
parent directories covering files I've unlinked... I expect the
deletes to be committed to disk when the last fsync() has returned.  I
require that a crash and restart will not see the files.  Several
kinds of transactional software and even some shell scripts expect this.
Will these asynchronous deletes break the guaranteed
commit-of-the-delete provided by fsync() on the parent directory?
