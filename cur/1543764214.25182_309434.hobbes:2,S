I'm not proposing that it not be a pointer, merely that it could be
intialiased to point to a lock structure within the request queue.
Doing this looks much simpler than your current patch ... one of the
problems with which looks to be that removing the scsi_driver module is
in trouble because we currently have the queue_release in the sdev
release (which won't get called while the queue holds a reference).
I think the correct model for all of this is that the block driver
shouldn't care (or be tied to) the scsi one.  Thus, as long as SCSI can
reject requests from a queue whose device has been released (without
checking the device) then everything is fine as long as we sort out the
lock lifetime problem.
