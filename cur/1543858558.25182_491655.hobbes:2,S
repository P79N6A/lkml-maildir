Thanks for clarifying Bill, and sorry Alan. ata_piix does indeed work 
correctly. The help text is a bit confusing:
config ATA_PIIX
        tristate "Intel PIIX/ICH SATA support"
        depends on PCI
        help
          This option enables support for ICH5/6/7/8 Serial ATA.
          If PATA support was enabled previously, this enables
          support for select Intel PIIX/ICH PATA host controllers.
"Enabled previously"?
