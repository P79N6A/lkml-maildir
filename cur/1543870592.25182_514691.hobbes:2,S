There are MS drivers for some Winbond hardware at 
http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~winbond/
 - the combination of those and the 
publically available docs from the memory stick site seems like enough 
to get a protocol driver. The tifm driver also appears to be growing 
memory stick support, and it looks like it's been implemented in a 
fairly generalisable way.
