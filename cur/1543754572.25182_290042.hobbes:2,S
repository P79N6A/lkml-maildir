    Hi everybody :)
    I've been solving a USB problem related to a digital photo
camera, and I've noticed that 'libusb' uses a ioctl interface to the
USB kernel system. In fact it implements 'usb_control_msg()' using
ioctl's. On the other hand, the kernel itself (I'm talking about
2.4.29) provides an API in <linux/usb.h> that implements too
'usb_control_msg()' using URB's.
    My question is: which interface should be used by user space
applications, <linux/usb.h> or ioctl's? Is the ioctl interface
deprecated in any way? In the "Programming guide for Linux USB Device
Drivers", located in 
http://usb.in.tum.de/usbdoc/,
 I can't find ioctl
interface references :?
    Thanks a lot in advance :)
