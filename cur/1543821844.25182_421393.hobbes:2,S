Ok.  Then I maintain that the bitmap of changed namespaces seems
unnecessary.  Since you're likely sharing an nsproxy with your parent
process, when you clone a new namespace you just want to immediately get
a new nsproxy pointing to the new namespaces.
Anyway this seems simple enough to just code up.  Simpler than
continuing to talk about it  :)
