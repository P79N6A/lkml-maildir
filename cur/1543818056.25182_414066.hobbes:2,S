I had filesystem corruption and needed ran xfs_repair.
After I finished I removed most of the lost and found bits but was left
with:
haze:/scratch/lost+found# ll

drwxr-xr-x   4 root root   38 2006-04-02 08:29 ./

Obviously I had an fs corruption (due to raid failure due to some bogus
libata errors) so this may not be the same thing.
