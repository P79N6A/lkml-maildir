the usbatm USB driver uses it in the methods for opening and closing a new network
connection, and on device disconnect.  Yes, tasklet_disable could be eliminated by
adding a spinlock.  However this would mean taking the lock every time a packet is
received or transmitted.  As it is, typically open occurs once, when the computer
boots, and close and disconnect also occur once each, when the computer shuts down.
I felt that three calls to tasklet_disable were better than a gazillion calls to
spin_(un)lock.  Please feel free to educate me :)
Ciao,
Duncan.
