True, did so for me :-)

Great! I've borrowed another PC with some 350GB to save my data and 
reconfigure my drive

Thats exactily what I would like to do! Great!
But is linux able to boot from this array?
Do I need some special Software package installed for use md ?
I'm trying to install Yoper and the install CD is lacking most software.
I'm in contact with the developer there and allowed to modify the install 
packages.

Would you write me a small howto?
My Hardware: 4x160GB, (1hh ata for installing, temporalily )
My partition would be:
- WinXP ( 10GB)
- Linux1 ( 20GB )
- Linux2 (10GB)
- Swap (2GB)
- FAT32 ( 100GB)
- /home (the rest)
Txs!
