Hello,
For a semester project I am experimenting with a new IO scheduler and I
was trying to set my scheduler to control a single device, to ease the
development and debugging, by using
   echo "foo" > /sys/block/ubdc/queue/scheduler
Much to my suprise, this sets the scheduler for the other block
devices as well! Does this happen only to UML block devices? Do I need
to do anything to allow a per-device scheduler? Is the functionality
there, or is it in-progress? Am I reading too much in the fact that
the queue/scheduler is defined under each block device?
Thank you,
florin
