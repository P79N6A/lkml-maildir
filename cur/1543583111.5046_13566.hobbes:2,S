Hi,
Hmm, it's a curious driver... Here is the patch (and the final .c) to get
it to compile under 2.4.2
http://www.moses.uklinux.net/patches/aweram/
but the driver doesn't probe for the (extremely frequent!) case when the
device has been prepared by the ISA-PNP subsystem. Looking at the
infrastructure in drivers/net/ne.c it seems doable to teach it the
language of isapnp_find_dev() API -- one just needs to know what
signatures to plug into the ISAPNP_VENDOR() and ISAPNP_FUNCTION() macros
-- my guess is that the output of /proc/isapnp contains this info.
Interesting... I will play with this and see if it detects my ISA-PNP SB
AWE64 card. Give the above patch a try and see if you figure out the
values to plug in there sooner than I do.
Regards,
Tigran
