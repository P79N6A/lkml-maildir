viotape was one of the first I started converting, but later I noticed
the same thing you found above. I have it commented out of my series for
that reason ..
I think this noblock path is actually doing what the author intended..
There are a few stray up() calls related to event handling and ioctls ,
and I think those are used to release the semaphore..
