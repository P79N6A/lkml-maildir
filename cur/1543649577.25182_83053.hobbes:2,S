Hi,
When I want to compile the kernel with gcc 3.3 but there is a lot of error during the "make bzImage":
"comparison between signed and unsigned"... then crash.
I tried with linux-2.4.18, linux-2.4.19 and linux-2.4.20-pre11 and I got the same things.
All are ok when I compile with gcc 3.2.
Anyone can help me or have the same problem or compile kernel with gcc 3. 3 without error ? [ :) ]
Thanks.
