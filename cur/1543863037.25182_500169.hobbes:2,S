that's not the point.  the point is that, as it stands now, the build
is *broken* in three ways.
first, it's broken because declaring something simply as "inline"
*forces* it to be inlined, which flies in the face of historical
convention and is more than a little misleading.
second, it's broken because both the use of
"__attribute__((always_inline))" all over the place and the
CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING kernel config option imply that you indeed have
a choice, when you clearly *don't*.  quite simply, you can play with
that kernel config option or splash the "always_inline" attributes
around all you want and, unbeknownst to you, none of that is making
the *slightest* bit of difference.  that is the very *definition* of a
"broken" build.
and, finally, you claim that you "don't see any place in the kernel
where we need a non-forced inline."  i have already posted an alpha
header file that claims (rightly or wrongly) to need that freedom.

that may be a better idea, but it doesn't address the current
brokenness.
i'm willing to believe that this patch has zero chance of going
anywhere.  but if you want to reject it, at least be honest about it.
don't say, "there's no problem here."  instead, say, "yes, the build
is broken but we don't feel like doing anything about it."
