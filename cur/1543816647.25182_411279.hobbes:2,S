Well the map has to be stored in flash or other non volatile memory.

No idea, but it is almost certainly also vendor specific.

I have seen some that a power off in the middle of a write would leave
the card dead (it left it with a partially updated block map).  On
others nothing happened (well you loose the write in progress of course
just as a harddisk would).

That is vendor specific.  Depends how they did it.  Different
generations from a given company may also be different in behaviour.  I
imagine some parts of it are patented by some of the comapnies involed
in flash card making.

The wearleveling is not a part of the CF spec.  So saying anything about
CF in general just doesn't make much sense.  It all depends on the
controller in the CF you are using.
