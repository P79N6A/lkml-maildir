Unfortunately I don't think we can do much about those as the error
message seems to indicate that there's a problem with the firmware...

Are you still seeing that sysfs related oops? Perhaps the lockup was
related to that...
Yi, please consider applying the included patch.

[PATCH] ipw2200: disallow direct scanning when device is down
The function ipw_request_direct_scan() should bail out when the device
is down. This patch fixes an lockup caused by wpa_supplicant
triggering ipw_request_direct_scan() while the driver was in a middle
of a reset due to firmware errors.
Thanks to Zilvinas Valinskas for reporting the bug and helping me
debug it.
