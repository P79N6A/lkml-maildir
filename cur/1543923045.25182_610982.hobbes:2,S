There can be different defaults for the user space API via libnuma that 
are indepdent from the kernel API which needs to remain stable. The kernel 
API can be extended but not changed.

None of those sound appealing. Multiple processes may run in one cpuset. 
Some of those may be linked to older libnumas and therefore depend on old
