Hmm. This solution is still just pampering over the real problem. The
delayed disable just re-sends level interrupts unnecessarily. I have a
fix (needs some testing) for this, which I send out tomorrow, when I'm
really back from vacation.
But suppressing the resend is not fixing the driver problem. The problem
can show up with spurious interrupts and with interrupts on a shared PCI
interrupt line at any time. It just might take weeks instead of minutes.
Alan,
is there anything which can be done on the driver level ?
