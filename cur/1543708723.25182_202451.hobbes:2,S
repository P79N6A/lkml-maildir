I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but it looks good.
If you're going to get rid of pci_dev.consistent_dma_mask in favor
of pci_dev.dev.coherent_dma_mask, would you want to do the same
with pci_dev.dma_mask?
Which brings to mind a second question; why is device.dma_mask
a u64 * instead of u64?  Does it typically point to pci_dev.dma_mask?
thanks
