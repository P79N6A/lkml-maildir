I'd like to state for the good of the order that since I updated to
2.4.21-rc2 and stopped trying to use the ac patch, I haven't had any
hangs, although I have had a few "8259A Interrupt" messages logged to
kmsg. No uniprocessor APIC support, ACPI + APM compiled in, SCSI
compiled into kernel instead of modularly, all NForce gunch tainting
up the kernel and working just fine.
