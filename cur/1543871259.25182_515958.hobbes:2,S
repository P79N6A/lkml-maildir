Sometimes we provide a config option which provides the default version of
the boot option.  So:
	CONFIG_SYSFS_VERSION=1.2
and
	if (user_provided_sysfs_version == NULL)
		user_provided_sysfs_version = CONFIG_SYSFS_VERSION;

If we make CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED just a boolean boot option then that
fixes this problem (we hope) but won't help us next time we want to change
something.
It all depends on whether sysfs is finished yet ;)
