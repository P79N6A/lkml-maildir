I downloaded linux-2.6.17.tar.gz from kernel.org, when extraceted created
linux-2.6.17 directory.  I zmore'd the patch-2.6.17-rc4-ide1.gz file and
noticed that it was working against linux-2.6.17-rc4-ide1, so I renamed
the linux-2.6.17 to linux-2.6.17-rc4-ide1 and zcat | patch -p0.
(Did I do this wrong?  Seemed to apply except for the two function calls
that I had to edit by hand)
Checking include/linux/libata.h reveals that: ATA_ENABLE_PATA is defined.
Thanks for all the help.  I really appreciate it, but hope that it's not
taking up too much of your time.
     Erik.
