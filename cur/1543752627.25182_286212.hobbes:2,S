Very nice, though, I am still feeling a little bit of lag when compiling
a kernel at nice 0 (-j2/3 helps and running at nice 10 fixes) which was
not present in ck1/2, and not present in vanilla. I am assuming this
will be really hard to track down :(
As far as games and cedega, these problems and sound problems have been
fixed! :)
Now, if we can get rid of that lag at nice 0, it'd be perfect!
Good work Con.
