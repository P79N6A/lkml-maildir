A modest request to Trond, Greg and hjl:
Would it be possible for you guys to coordinate changes and patches with
Alan?  I'm certainly willing to pound on the NFS client/server system
(Lord-knows I'm an expert at evincing misbehavior), but it's starting to
get _real_ confusing with all these patches flying around.  Linus has
implied that he's not super interested in applying anything that isn't
relatively cohesive and well-explained, and Alan has been quite diligent
about merging and pre-qualifying.  So, we have the framework of a
reasonable process.
At the moment, HJ has patches in the latest knfsd utils which touch on
some of the same things that gam's posted patches did - though seemingly
not in the same manner :-(.  Some of the patches against nfs/dir.c in
knfsd conflict with Alan's in 2.2.3-ac3, etc, etc.
