Matthew  is not alone with this problem.  I have it too.  Its not new here.  Its
been happening as long as I have had gentoo amd64 installed.  It can be hard
to reproduce but eventually, when 32 bit apps are used, my box bricks.  There is
nothing in the logs (nor on a serial console) - the box just freezes.  
My kernel is _not_ tainted.  The kernel is currently 2.6.23-gentoo-r5-crc with 
the latest cfs backport applied; it does not seem to be critical though as it has
happen with all kernels I have tried (mm, linux and gentoo varients).  
The processor is:

cpu family      : 15

I asked about this lkml before and was told it was probably a cpu/hardware issue...  Its 
interesting that Matthew is also running gentoo.
Thanks,
