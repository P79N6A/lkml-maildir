This would be question for Greg.

We already have a lot of drivers for special HID devices that emit usages 
that have not been defined by HID standard. These drivers are independent 
on the underlying transport (USB, Bluetooth). Therefore all you ideally 
need to do is to add just another driver which hooks itself to HID bus and 
performs all that is needed in addition to what generic HID code does. 
There are lot of such drivers in drivers/hid/hid-*.c which you can use as 
examples. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
