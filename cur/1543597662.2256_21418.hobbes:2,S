Subject: [PATCH] (1/11) fs/super.c fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Linus, I'm resending the second series of superblock handling
fixes. There are 11 chunks (the largest being 5Kb) - I'm sending each
of them in a separate mail (with descriptions). This stuff finally
closes the get_super() races and seriously cleans superblock handling.
It had been in -ac for a while (and got more than a month of testing on
local boxen). Please, apply.
Part 1/11
We grab exclusive lock on ->s_umount() in get_sb_...() and release it
once vfsmount is formed (by do_add_mount()). No deadlocks, since all
activity in protected area is already not allowed to lead to anything
that would grab ->s_umount. We hold ->s_lock over the whole non-trivial part
and anything of that kind would deadlock on it.
We are almost done with the get_super() races by now.
