I'm not sure if the original distribution of irqtune supports 2.2 but
the RedHat version runs on 2.2 very well (i think it might have been in
the contrib directory)..
It's in my bag of dirty tricks on an old ip masq/server box. Modem is on
irq 4 (highest prio), ethernet is on irq 5 (next in line).
If he has a data backup, he could see if 'hdparm -u1' makes a difference too.
