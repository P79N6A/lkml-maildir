/me has no official position wrt cpufreq core [except userspace
cpufrequtils, but I intend to hand this over to somebody else in the next
few months].
Dave, as maintainer of cpufreq, has a cpufreq bitkeeper tree [http interface
at 
http://linux-dj.bkbits.net/
 ] which is exported as plain diff daily at
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/cpufreq/daily-snapshots/
 . This does
not contain your patches yet, probably because he's still busy with other
stuff.
Thanks,
	Dominik
