For the failed primary path case yes.  In the case the primary path is
working, I would think booting from a multipath device and a RAID1 
device would be very very similar, or even identical, from the 
perspective of the BIOS, right?

Hmm, I thought I had tried this, but, I had tried so many things.
If anyone has successfully set up a system booting from a multipath
md device, I'd like to hear about it.
What I tried was more or less this:
1. Install normally to disk-A, remove disk-A from the system.
2. Install normally to disk-B.  Install disk-A into the system.
   and boot from disk-B.  (now I can safely copy from disk-A, which has
   no actively mounted partitions.)
3.  Create multipath devices on disk-C, one for each partition.
   The partitions are bigger than those on disk-A, to allow for md to
	put its data at the end.
4.  Copy, (using dd) the partitions from disk-A to the md devices.
5.  mount the md devices, and chroot to the md-root device.
    Try to figure out how to run lilo to make booting from disk-C possible
    also, initrd modifications to insmod multipath.o, mount the md devices,
    etc.  This part, (making lilo work) I never was able to figure out.
  Would boot up and say "LI" then stop... or various other problems
  that I can't quite recall now.  (this was a couple weeks ago)
I guess this is getting a little off topic for linux-kernel, so maybe I 
should let this drop now, or take it over to linux-raid, but I _would_ 
like to hear from anyone who has got a multipath boot device working.
Anyway, even if this can be made to work, this leaves a rather ugly and
convoluted method of installation.

Ok, good to hear.  (I had it only on hearsay that grub couldn't do it,
so my experiments were confined to lilo.)
