I'd suggest this message could be so frequent that you want to
link it's display to real time. Check the jiffy counter each
time and if it's been less that X seconds since the last message
just up a counter. Plus in the message say how many instructions
have been emulated since the last one ... eg if it's only five
I don't care, but five million would be a problem!
One other thing ... should the FPU emulator also display messages
like these if it's used?
