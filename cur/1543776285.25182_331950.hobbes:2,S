Hello,
Just for the records....
-----
root@ecam:~$ ./headpark /dev/hda
head not parked 4c
-----
HDD is a desktop Maxtor Diamond MaxPlus 9 120GB
on a Promise Ultra133 TX2 IDE Controller.
Well, sure, it's not a notebook HDD, but maybe it's possible
to give headpark a more generic way to get the heads parked?
Are the commands different per HDD model / manufacturer?
Then we might need some information to send the proper
commands to the different types?!
And if there is no headpark command, might it be valuable to send
the HDD a shutdown instead?
PS:
I'm working on an embedded PowerPC (MPC8540) system which
will be turned into a high-resolution portable camera in
the future (with acceleration sensors for the right image
orientation). Therefore it will likely be another candidate
for a Drop'n'Park or Drop'n'Stop (tm) feature as are planning
to put a 2.5" notebook HDD into the cam, too.
Greets,
Clemens Koller
