Yes, socket->socket sendfile is not that sexy.  I actually did this
for 2.2.16 in the obvious (and stupid) way, copying data into a buffer
and writing it it out again.  The performance was unsurprisingly
_exactly_ identical to a userspace read()/write() loop.
There is a use for an optimized socket->socket transfer - proxying
high speed TCP connections.  It would be exciting if the zerocopy
networking framework led to a decent socket->socket transfer.
