Subject: [Patch0/4]: fake numa for x86_64 patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch set resolves issues with running fake numa on x86_64.  We
have also extended the command line numa=fake=NUM command line option to
specify different size nodes.  The default NODES_SHIFT is also
incremented from 6 to 8 to allow MAX_NUM_NODES to be 256.
Patch [1/4]: Add the e820_hole_size to give the size of hole in a given
address range
Patch [2/4]: Increase the NODE_SHIFT from 6 to 8.
Patch [3/4]: Fix the existing numa=fake so that ioholes are
appropriately configured.  Currently machines that have sizeable IO
holes don't work with numa=fake>4.
Patch[4/4]: Extend the command line so that user can specify different
size nodes on a command line.
