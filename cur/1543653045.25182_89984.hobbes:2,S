Sorry, I didn't follow the whole discussion, so my argument may make no
sense at all, too. :-)
If I understand David correctly, he doesn't worry about programs that
want to use huge pages, but about programs just using mmap just to
access some file. If they get called with a file that behaves subtly
different than usual files, that may lead to failures or even security
holes.
But that's no argument to keep the syscalls, if you decide to implement
hugepagefs. The existance of the syscalls doesn't prevent bugs created
or triggered by hugepagefs.
