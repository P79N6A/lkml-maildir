Hi ,
     Can I run a SMP kernel on a UP machine (x86 based ) ??
     I am working with 2.4.19 kernel compiled with CONFIG_SMP on a 
UniProcessor machine. The machine boots up with the SMP kernel 
configured in .
    The Problem comes when I try to create a kernel thread using 
the example at  
http://www.scs.ch/~frey/linux/kernelthreads.html
   The entire machine hangs on loading the thread_mod.o ..
   What am I doing wrong ?? Is there any option that needs to be 
turned on to get this working ??
   Thanks for any help
   Regards
