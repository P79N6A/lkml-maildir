i certainly did not ignore lockmeter - i periodically tried it and even 
considered adding it to -rt. But it was always pretty problematic from 
an impact POV:
  23 files changed, 2659 insertions(+), 13 deletions(-)
and nobody pushed strong enough to get it included. But ... Peter's 
patch could perhaps be extended to cover similar stats as lockmeter, 
ontop of the existing lockdep instrumentation. Peter, can you see any 
particular roadblocks with that?
