First line of attack would be to strace minicom and find out why it's
failing.
There are a few reasons why I think the kernel isn't to blame:
- I run minicom against the new serial subsystem fairly frequently, and
  haven't noticed any oddities like the reported problem.
- The core.c/8250.c drivers don't have very much to do with serial device
  locking - serial devices are locked by creating a file in /var/lock
  with a name corresponding to the device name being opened.
