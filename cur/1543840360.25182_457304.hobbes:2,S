Yes. That was what proposed earlier. But for 1k, 2k allocations we end 
up wasting whole page.
Isn't it ? Thats why I created right sized slabs and disable slab-debug. 
I guess, I can do this
only for 1k, 2k filesystems and directly use alloc_page() for 4k and 8k 
- but that would make
code ugly and also it doesn't handle cases for bigger base pagesize 
systems (64k power).
Thanks,
