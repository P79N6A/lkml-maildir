Certainly many riser cards only have jumpers to change the irq for the
second slot, or some default built in remapping.  And they may have id
select pins to pick which slots they should pretend to be.  From what I
have read, via mini itx boards require a very specific design for riser
boards, which isn't what most riser boards do.  Other mini itx boards
are probably different.

Certainly the simplest is a riser card with a proper pci bridge that
creates a secondary pci bus with it's own device ids and maps the
interrupts correctly.  Then all that really matters is that the bios on
the board supports pci bridges (a few companies actually manage to fail
to support pci bridges at all in their bioses).
