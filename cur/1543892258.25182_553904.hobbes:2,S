Subject: Question about spinlock in linux kernel

I found there is such a kernel symbol ".text.lock.spinlock",
for example,
# cat /proc/kallsyms | grep spinlock
ffffffff8011e440 T bust_spinlocks
ffffffff802d00fc t .text.lock.spinlock
ffffffff8832ae20 d state_spinlock       [nfs]
but I can not find that who exported such a symbol?I am wondering
where is this kernel originated from? I mean, if I faced any oops,
which shows RIP is for example:
RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff8031a4d9>] <ffffffff8031a4d9>{.text.lock.spinlock+0}
then how can i locate the oops?it seems that .text.lock.spinlock is
neither a function name, nor a variable name, so i am confused, who
can help me out of here? Any advises is really really appreciated!
Regards
Jason Xiao
