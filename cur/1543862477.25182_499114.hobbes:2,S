"Nothing is impossible." Since you happened to take that one for
yourself... well here's a q: would a patch be accepted that changes
all ipt and ip6t modules to the new xt? Even if a module is only for
ipv4 or ipv6, I think it makes sense to reduce the number of
different *t structures floating around.
