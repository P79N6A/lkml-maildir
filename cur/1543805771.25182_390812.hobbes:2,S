No, but I/O alone shouldn't have such effect.

I thought I did :). Freezing userspace first means the dd thread gets stopped 
first. Once the dd thread is stopped, the kernel threads processing the I/O 
requests have a finite amount of work to do (instead of having new work being 
submitted all the time), and can thus complete that and then be frozen in a 
far more deterministic fashion.
Regarding the stats I promised to Pavel, I'm heading home from LCA today, so I 
probably won't get them prepared until Monday now - unless I get lazy and 
only do 10 attempts instead of 100 :)
Regards,
Nigel
