i could use the -bk snapshots too, but since i am using bk myself (i try),
i think we can narrow it down a bit more.

i've put an lspci output here:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/lspci-v.txt
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/lspci-vv.txt
i do not suspect hw problems *yet*, because kernel up to 2.6.9 (tracking
bk) do not show this behaviour.

will show up in a couple of minutes here:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/objdump-d_a1.2463.txt.bz2
this is from the vmlinux from a "bk undo -a1.2463" kernel, IOW it still
contains:
ChangeSet@1.2463, 2004-11-04 17:07:16-08:00, torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org
  Merge bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/driver-2.6
  into ppc970.osdl.org:/home/torvalds/v2.6/linux
thank you for the hints,
Christian.
PS: should we i un'CC linux-sound and alsa-devel, now we are sure it's a
pci thing?
