Hello network gurus!
To make a clean reboot of a remote embedded system, I need to have
<somebody> send a FIN to every connected hosts. In an interactive
system, init usually kills all the tasks, which forces an exit().
The kernel then closes all the sockets/fd's, etc. This usually is
sufficient to have most of the connected hosts disconnect before
the server crashes. This seems to be more time-related than anything
else. 
In this embedded system, my home-made init does a kill(-1, 9) before
it reboots, but this is not sufficient. No FINs are sent to connected
hosts even if I sleep() a second after this.
Also, the equivalent of `ifconfig eth0 down` does not close these
sockets. I haven't mucked with routing yet.
Does anybody know if there is a socket call (or any other way), to
tell the network to disconnect __everybody__ __now__?
The connected hosts do disconnect after the embedded system reboots.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
