Absolutely.
This particular warning means, that someone (usually indeed hid2hci) 
passed usage through hiddev that was out of bounds, with respect to the 
device's report descriptor.
This usually means that hid2hci has chosen the wrong method to switch the 
modes. Unfortunately, it's not easy to implement always the switching 
properly, if we don't know the vendor-specific packet that has to be sent.
