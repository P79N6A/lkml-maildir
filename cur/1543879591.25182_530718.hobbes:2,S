Good day.
Stumbling around with git here. I'd like to use git to efficiently track the 
  current -stable as well as -current. Say, my local tree is a clone of 
Linus current:
git clone \ 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git local
I then branch off a 2.6.20 branch:
cd local
git checkout -b v2.6.20 v2.6.20
to now update to the current -stable I could do:
git pull \ 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.20.y.git
each time that a new -stable is released. Rather though, I'd like a simple 
"git pull" to do this while on this branch while a "git pull" while back on 
the master branch pulls from the originally cloned Linus repo again.
Is this possible? Do I want it to be? Comments like "work like this instead" 
welcome as well; figuring out what the heck it is that I want from git seems 
to be one of the most difficult questions to answer...
Currently using git 1.5.0.4.
Rene.
