Here (with 2.2.2ac7 on KSI-Linux 2.0) all works just fine. No crash, just
-- cut --
[khim@nomad test2]$ cd ..
cd: could not get current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
cd: could not get current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
[khim@nomad test2]$
-- cut --
BTW you need only one xterm: just use
-- cut --
[khim@nomad test2]$ rmdir .
[khim@nomad test2]$ rmdir ..
-- cut --
and you should get the same result...
P.S. Hm. Why rmdir .. successed ? Where this '..' was found if there are
no '.' ? I understood WHY it successed (from kernel viewpoint) but not
understood if it's correct (from user viewpoint)...
