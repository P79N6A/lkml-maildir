Hm.  Is "asm volatile" necessary if you have a "memory" clobber?  Would
probably be the safest thing, I guess.

Yeah, they're completely different.  They're not even analogous, really,
which was my point.  People confer more meaning to "asm volatile" than
it actually has, because of the analogy with volatile variables/types. 
They would have been better off with something like "asm static", which
isn't much more meaningful, but at least it doesn't mislead the reader
into thinking it has anything to do with the other volatile.
But yes, seems like a worthwhile thing to point out.  Or just point to
the gcc manual, which is pretty clear about all this stuff.
