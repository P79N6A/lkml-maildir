Good to hear.

I am surprised, you should see a difference, especially with the
latencytest.  Silly question, but you both applied the patch and enabled
the config statement, right?
No, at this stage of development we are seeing greatly reduced latency
times with the patch.  Continued work is going to be on improving
locking mechanisms, but this is something that will come about later and
improve the kernel overall.

No, 15ms is very good.  I am seeing things 5-10ms here, but much much
higher without preemption. Odd.

Oh, Good. we earlier had problems with an Athlon optimized kernel, but
we have solved those problems.

Thank you.

I can't think of a benchmark that tests various aspects of a filesystem
(file creation/deletion, directory seeking and listing, etc.) but that
would be great to see if xfs improves with preemption.
You can test raw disk I/O with dbench 
ftp://samba.org/pub/tridge/dbench/
... try 16 threads (dbench -16).
