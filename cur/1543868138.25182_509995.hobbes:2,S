+ * @mtd_num: the underlying MTD device number
+ * @mtd_name: the underlying MTD device name

+ *
+ * The erase counter header is always stored at offset zero. By default, the
+ * VID header is stored after the EC header at the closest aligned offset
+ * (note, aligned means aligned to the minimum I/O unit size in this context).
+ * Data starts next to the VID header at the closest aligned offset. But for
+ * different reasons (e.g., optimization), UBI may be asked to put the VID
+ * header at another offset, and even at an unaligned offset. Of course, if the
+ * offset of the VID header is unaligned, UBI adds proper padding before it.
+ *
+ * About minimal I/O units. In general, UBI assumes flash device model where
+ * there is only one minimal I/O unit size. E.g., in case of NOR flash it is 1,
+ * in case of NAND flash it is a NAND page, etc. This is reported by MTD in the
+ * @writesize field. But as an exception, UBI admits of using another
+ * (smaller) minimal I/O unit size for EC and VID headers to make it possible
+ * to do different optimizations.
+ *
+ * For example, this is extremely useful in case of NAND flashes which admit of
+ * several write operations to one NAND page. In this case UBI can fit EC and
+ * VID headers at one NAND page. So, in case of such NAND flashes UBI uses
+ * "sub-page" size as the minimal I/O unit for the headers (the
+ * @hdrs_min_io_size field). But it still reports NAND page size (min_io_size)
+ * as a minimal I/O unit for the UBI users.
+ *
+ * Example: some Samsung NANDs with 2KiB pages allow 4x 512-byte writes, so
+ * although the minimal I/O unit is 2K, UBI uses 512 bytes for UBI and VID
+ * headers.
+ *
+ * Q: why not just to treat sub-page as a minimal I/O unit of this flash
+ * device, e.g., make @min_io_size = 512 in the example above?
+ *
+ * A: because when writing a sub-page, MTD still writes a full 2K page but the
+ * bytes which are no relevant to the sub-page are 0xFF. So, basically, writing
+ * 4x512 sub-pages is 4x times slower then writing one 2KiB NAND page. Thus, we
+ * prefer to use sub-pages only for EV and VID headers.
+ *
+ * As it was noted above, the VID header may start at an non-aligned offset.
+ * For example, in case of a 2KiB-PER-page NAND flash with a 512 bytes
+ * sub-page, the VID header may reside at offset 1984 which is the last 64
+ * bytes of the last sub-page (EC header is always at offset zero). This causes
+ * some difficulties when reading and writing VID headers.
+ *
+ * Suppose we have a 64-byte buffer and we read VID header at it. We change the
+ * data and wand to write this VID header to some eraseblock. As we can only
+ * write in 512-byte chunks, we have to allocate one more buffer and copy our
+ * VID header to offset 448 of this buffer.
+ *
+ * The I/O unit, together with the memory allocation unit do the following
+ * trick in order to avoid this extra copy. The memory allocation allocates
+ * a @vid_hdr_alsize bytes buffer for the VID header and returns a pointer to
+ * offset @vid_hdr_shift of this buffer. When write VID headers, we shift the
+ * VID header pointed back and write the whole sub-page.
