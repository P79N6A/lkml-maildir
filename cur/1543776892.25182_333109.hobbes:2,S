Well, couple stupid comments:
#1: I'm not *entirely* sure Linus reads every mail to lkml..  Dunno if
    you also sent it to him directly, but if not then that might explain
    the lack of response...
#2: Have you got a patch that does this?  If not, you might want to
    write one up and just submit it..  If you're expecting someone else
    to write it, well, that might also be why you've not had much
    response... :)
    	Thanks,
