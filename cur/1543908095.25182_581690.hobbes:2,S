Subject: [PATCH] Emulex FC HBA driver: fix overflow of statically allocated array

Hi,
The Coverity checker noticed that we may overrun a statically allocated 
array in drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_sli.c::lpfc_sli_hbqbuf_find().
The case is this; In 'struct lpfc_hba' we have 
	#define LPFC_MAX_HBQS  4
	...
	struct lpfc_hba {
		...
		struct hbq_s hbqs[LPFC_MAX_HBQS];
		...
	};
But then in lpfc_sli_hbqbuf_find() we have this code 
	hbqno = tag >> 16;
	if (hbqno > LPFC_MAX_HBQS)
		return NULL;
if 'hbqno' ends up as exactely 4, then we won't return, and then this
	list_for_each_entry(d_buf, &phba->hbqs[hbqno].hbq_buffer_list, list) {
will cause an overflow of the statically allocated array at index 4, 
since the valid indices are only 0-3. 
I propose this patch, that simply changes the 'hbqno > LPFC_MAX_HBQS' 
into 'hbqno >= LPFC_MAX_HBQS' as a possible fix.
