Smaller rings lead to better thruput, especially on the slower cpus.  Not 
that in part the slowness was caused by having slab debugging enabled.  
Turning slab debugging off brought the p3s up to ~500mbit and the athlons 
over 900.

Ah.  That part is something I was thinking of deleting, and now will do.

Paranoia during writing.  I'll reaudit.  That said, volatile behaviour 
is not compiler version specific.

The +16 is for alignment (just like the comment says).  The hardware 
requires that rx buffers be 64 bit aligned.

Ah, api updates.  Added to the todo.

tx descriptors have no alignment restriction, rx descriptors must be 
64 bit aligned.  Someone chose not to include the transistors for a 
barrel shifter in the rx engine.

Hrm?  Currently it will do a wakeup when at least one packet (8 sg 
descriptors) can be sent.  Given that the tx done code is only called 
when a tx desc (every 1/4 or so of the tx queue) or txidle interrupt 
occurs, it shouldn't be that often.
