Adding counters to structures generally is not going to increase
complexity (especially when you comment the code).  It would increase
the code size slightly.
The code to bump the counters should also be extremely simple
(surely we don't drop packets in more than just a few places).
So, in this case, the increase in complexity seems pretty minimal.

External-only patches almost always rot, and are extremely hard to really
share across organizations.  Still, point taken.
Thanks,
