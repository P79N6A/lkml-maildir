I am the current Parted maintainer.  I am rather busy, and haven't had
time to do a good job.  However, I haven't "dropped" it.  I would
welcome a co-maintainer though :)

Would this solve any problems?  The people who get hit aren't going
to use the switch, right?

For the same reasons, I haven't been getting bug reports.  I first found
out that this was a (non-hypothetical) problem on Slashdot.  I can't
reproduce the bug.  Nor can Jeremy Katz at Red Hat.  If anyone out there
can, please get in touch!

You need to add these to the list:
	(4) There aren't any partitions that end before cylinder 1024.
	(5) The partition table is inconsistent.
Parted does inspect the partition table to try to figure out the
geometry.  I'm not sure why Parted is messing up so much.  (The current
analyses don't explain it)  I really need more information.

Shouldn't we just use LBA?  (i.e. x/255/63)

Is there any evidence of this?  I think 6 months.  (Seriously, has
anyone done any research?)

Remember, back when it was proposed, everyone claimed "everyone uses
LBA", and hence it was irrelevant.  I thought it was better to keep it
as it was.

I don't understand this sentence.

You know there is a patch.  The problem is that "how-to-fix" is
contentious, not that we can't produce a patch.
Cheers,
