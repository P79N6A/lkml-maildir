Subject: [PATCH 06/27] r-o-bind-mounts-stub-functions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/1/364

This patch adds two function mnt_want_write() and mnt_drop_write().  These are
used like a lock pair around and fs operations that might cause a write to the
filesystem.
Before these can become useful, we must first cover each place in the VFS
where writes are performed with a want/drop pair.  When that is complete, we
can actually introduce code that will safely check the counts before allowing
r/w<->r/o transitions to occur.
