You chopped my sentence in half! :-D  What I *really* said was:
> ...give type conversion errors for 'int foo = NULL' but not 'char  
> *foo = NULL'.
The pseudo-standard "#define NULL (0)" that the C++ standards ask for  
does *NOT* give an error for "int foo = NULL;", and in C++ the C- 
standard "#define NULL ((void *)0)" *does* give an error for "char  
*foo = NULL;"  Ergo I think I was correct when I said "GCC uses  
[__null] to give type conversion errors for <the-first> but not <the- 
second>"
