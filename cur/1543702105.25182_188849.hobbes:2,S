The current autofs daemon, for example, does not handle different
procedures on umount.  This is particularly important when you have
mount trees.

That's what the Linux community is doing, de facto.  The Linux userspace
simply is not set up to handle namespaces, and the autofs daemon is no
exception.  Consider such a simple thing as /etc/mtab - /proc/mounts
which is necessary for most of the mount(8) functionality to work.  It
doesn't support namespaces and really cannot be made to.
namespace support in Linux is at the best a far-off future goal.  It is
one thing to put in infrastructure, especially since it has some other
nice benefits; it's another thing to revamp all of userspace to use it;
it's nowhere close and autofs is no exception.
