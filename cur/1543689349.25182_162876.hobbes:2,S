If you thought before you spoke you'd realize how wrong you are.  How many
locks are there in the IRIX/Solaris/Linux I/O path?  How many are needed for
2-4 way scaling?  
Here's the litmus test: list all the locks in the kernel and the locking
hierarchy.  If you, a self claimed genius, can't do it, how can the rest
of us mortals possibly do it?  Quick.  You have 30 seconds, I want a list.
A complete list with the locking hierarchy, no silly awk scripts.  You have
to show which locks can deadlock, from memory.
No list?  Cool, you just proved my point.
