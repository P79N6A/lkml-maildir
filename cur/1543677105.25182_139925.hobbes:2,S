That's nice, the latest ATI driver contains 98% of the KT400 AGP
driver I wrote for 2.5. The remainder being 1% copyright/credit
notices that they didn't need, and the other 1% being some breakage
to make sure it can't possibly work in AGP 3 mode.
What a train wreck.
I would look deeper into the source, but I'd rather not take a second
look at my lunch right now.
Go ATI!
