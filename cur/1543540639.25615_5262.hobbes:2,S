It would appear that knfsd does not work with netgroups that are in
/etc/netgroup, but only if they are in NIS maps, regardless of what
/etc/nsswitch.conf says. While we like the netgroup concept, and it makes
administering NFS exports a whole lot easier, we'd rather not have to use
NIS to get that functionality.
So, my question is, is this considered a bug?  Or is this problem not
infact a kernel problem, but instead a library problem?  More to the
point, are there currently any efforts to make NFS work with /etc/netgroup
as opposed to with NIS only?  Or are my tools just out of date?
By and large we're running RedHat 6.1 though we do have a mix.  The NFS
server I'm building is a RH 6.2 machine, so I figured the tools would be
reasonably up-to-date (though quite possibly buggy, as I haven't checked 
into that yet).
Thanks!
