I would really like to see these error messages and the command you used
when you saw the problem. I have now successfully written 3.5 GB in
variable block mode and fixed block mode with 1024 kB blocks. I addition
to this I have done a backup of over 5 GB. This was with test7-pre6,
aic-7850, and HP DDS-2 drive.
So, there does not seem to be a categorical write limit of 2.4 GB for SCSI
tapes and I can't reproduce your problem without more information.
