	Why would it be, and what kind of stopping ("estoppel")
are you referring to?
	I do not believe that when one contributes to Linux that
one is promising not to pursue other copyright problems anywhere
elsewhere in the code.  If you can point to a court decision or law
that says something analogous, I would be interesting in hearing
about it.
	I believe the pre-exising condition, if it was pre-existing,
of the firmware being present in a few infringing drivers among many
non-infringing drivers would not mean that permission was granted
to produce a derivative work comingling the few illegal drivers
(or even prove prior knowledge of the few illegal drivers).
	I know I have been complaining about the infringing drivers
and asking that people stop infringing approximately since I became
aware of the infringement.
	Again, I'm not a lawyer, so please do not use my layman's
opinions as legal advice.
