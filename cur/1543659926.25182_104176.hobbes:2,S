Regardless, people still use eepro100, so I would still like to get
eepro100 doing VLAN.
The reason why the patch was not accepted is that it changes one magic
number to another magic number, and without chipset docs, I had no idea
what either magic number really meant.
Now that Intel has released chipset docs, this is an excellent time to
re-evaluate those eepro100 VLAN changes.  I still refuse to accept a
"change the magic numbers" patch... any change will need to define
a constant that describes the bits we wish to set/clear.
Download the e100 documentation from the e1000 sourceforge site:
