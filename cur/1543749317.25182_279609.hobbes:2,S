Heh, ok.  Then stick with what you are doing, as long as you rely on
udevstart to create your device nodes, and not try to do it with a bash
script (which is what the original start_udev did), you should be fine.

Those aren't nodes, they are symlinks.  No way for udev to know about
them :)

Subdirs for mounting file systems on, again, no way udev can know about
them.
So, it looks like udev is really creating every device node you need.
