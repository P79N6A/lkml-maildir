Well, nobody else has spoken up on this, so I might as well.  I remember
when Daniel originally posted this fix, and at the time it was the right
thing to do.  Al's patch fixed more than Daniel's did, but I think it is
too much change to be adding to 2.2, so we should use the minimal fix
from Daniel, unless there are objections.
Cheers, Andreas
