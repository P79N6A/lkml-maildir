OK. Thanks for trying it.
The feedback will be helpful in trying to improve the mechanisms.

Probably but this one is fairly simple.
I think the remaining problems with interactive responsiveness is that 
bonuses increase too slowly when a latency problem is detected.  I.e. a 
task just gets one extra bonus point when an unacceptable latency is 
detected regardless of how big the latency is.  This means that it may 
take several cycles for the bonus to be big enough to solve the problem. 
  I'm going to try making the bonus increment proportional to the size 
of the latency w.r.t. the limit.
