Actually, any existing daemon (read "syslog") can use this space. This is
partly why it is a "security feature" so that the logs can still get to disk

Patch not necessary - it is a tuneable feature. All that is missing is
an understanding of what the reservation is/can be used for.

Already done - see "man tune2fs".
