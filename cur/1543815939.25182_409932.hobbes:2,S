For those users who feel they do have a compelling argument for it, please 
speak now or I'll end up maintaining this in -ck only forever.  I've come to 
depend on it with my workloads now so I'm never dropping it. There's no point 
me explaining how it is useful yet again, though, because I just end up 
looking like I'm handwaving. It seems a shame for it not to be available to 
all linux users.
Cheers,
Con
