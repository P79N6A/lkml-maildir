Dick,
You're right that the one-liner below may not necessarily produce a seg
fault, but shouldn't it terminate normally if it doesn't?  After all,
the program just *reads*.  Hanging does not seem to be an option!
BTW, your example program produces very similar output for the 2.4 and
2.2 kernels to which I have access.  I apologize for any confusion my
original report created -- 0xc0000000 was chosen because of its relation
to the start of the stack frame, and indeed it has nothing
to do with the size of virtual address space.
