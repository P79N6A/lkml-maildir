  So

Ah - thanks for explaining that for me, Andrew.
Michal, there were several XFS fixes (4, I think) that went into -rc7.  If
-rc6 fails and -rc7 doesn't then we need to check if one of those fixes is
responsible. The crash doesn't match any of the symptoms we've seen from them,
but it's worth checking.
Cheers,
Dave.
