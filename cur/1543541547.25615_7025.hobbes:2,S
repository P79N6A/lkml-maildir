They will want it for tar(1). Immediately. And for rpm. And for all weird
shit handled by things like mc(1). Mark my word, you will get a _huge_
recurring flamewar on hands. With joint letters begging to put file(1)
into the kernel. Let's leave that to userland. Really. "mark foo as a
tarfs fodder" - sure. Will do wonders in filemanagers. Putting that
into the kernel... Not too pleasant.
	As for the GNOME looking nice...
<looking around for GNOME folks>
<note date=Monday text="don't forget body-armor">
	Just look at the guts of that animal someday. It makes EMACS look 
beautiful and well-designed. I'm serious. No offence to Miguel et.al., but
GNOME design is just plain Wrong. The underlying model (CORBA) is horribly
overdesigned and they keep bloating their interfaces. It's a walking
offence to Occam's Razor, and I mean API, not applications. That's what
you get when default reaction to "I want foo" is not "hmm... probably can
be done as combination of bar, baz and quux" but "sure, let's just add a
new piece to the API". Sigh...
