It was discussed on alsa-devel in November.  Unfortunately, I can't
find ML archive any longer...
The blocking behavior of OSS is a feature which is nowehre defined.
Some OSS drivers open in the blocking mode and some don't.
So, apps shouldn't depend on this feature.
We had implemented OSS emulation in the blocking manner since we
intepreted the POSIX definition in that way.  But Linus pointed out
that it's a misreading.
BTW, you can enable the blocking mode again via module/boot option.
See OSS-Emulation.txt.

Please provide the hardware details (I don't see your original post to
lkml).  Otherwise it'll be a vapor discusson...
