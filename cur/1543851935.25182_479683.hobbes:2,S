Thanks.
But on the other hand we probably have a similar code (set condition +
wake_up_process()) in other places too, and __wake_up(wait_queue_head_t)
has (in theory) the same problem. Probably we can add something like
	smp_wmb_unless_spin_lock_implies_memory_barrier_on_this_arch()
somewhere in try_to_wake_up(). I dunno.
Oleg.
