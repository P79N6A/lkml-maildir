I'm trying to build a simple file system and keep access transparent to
the user.
I want to trap commands like open, close, read, write and seek.  For
example,
when a open command is  performed on a file beginning with a certain
prefix,
I want to run my code, otherwise the normal code.  Is there a 'nice' way
of doing this?
Any information/example would be very helpful.
Cheers.
