Exactly!
These patches are really too big and can't be called clean... naming,
bunch of debug etc. I can post the same amount of OpenVZ stuf and
Herbert will claim his code is more clear after that.
Also these patches contradict to what was discussed before: different
name spaces for each subsystem.

Eric, though I suggest to postpone proc and sysctl a bit, can you share
me your vision of /proc and /sysctl virtualization a bit?
A good way to handle them IMHO is to make fully virtual, i.e. each
namespace should have an own set of sysctl or proc tree.

If you need any help with it in OpenVZ, feel free to ask. We have
broken-out patches for recent 2.6.16 kernel.

Hmmm, strange claim/conclusion... /dev/kmem allows to change namespaces
also :) and even to obtain root priviliges if needed... :)

Eric, let's not compare approaches with inches :)
As you remember your PID namespaces doesn't suite us well... :(
Thanks,
