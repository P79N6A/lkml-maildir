Yes.  It is useful for uid 0 in other namespaces to have some capabilities.
But that is just a matter of giving another user some additional
capabilities.  That mechanism may still work but it should not be
namespace specific magic there.  The trick I guess is which
capabilities a setuid binary for the other root user gets.
One thing to be careful about here is that, at least as I 
envision it until setresuid is called your user does not change
even when you unshare your user namespace.

No.  The uids in a filesystem are interpreted in some user namespace
context.  We can discover that context at the first mount of the
filesystem.  Assuming the uids on a filesystem are the same set
of uids your process is using is just wrong.

Yes.  Your patch does lay some interesting foundation work.
But we must not merge it upstream until we have a complete patchset
that handles all of the user namespace issues.

Yes.  This is an existing problem, which we have just escalated the
frequency of immensely if we are doing user namespaces.  The normal
solution is to put everyone on the network in a single user id
administration domain with ldap or NIS.
However that is avoiding the problem, and having multiple user id
domains is the point of a user id namespace.  If we escalate the
problem we should solve it.

keys are essentially security credentials for something besides the
local kernel.  Think kerberos tickets.  That makes the keys the
obvious place to say what uid you are in a different user namespace
and similar things.

One piece at a time :)
