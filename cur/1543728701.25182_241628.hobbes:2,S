Actually, it's even more suspicious than that. As I said in the first message 
in this thread, this is my second Lite-on drive - I replaced the original 
(with a model that mt-rainier.org/ shows as being validated) in an attempt to 
get Mt Rainier working. Furthermore, my attempts to find a solution on LKML 
unearted a posting by Doug Holland, who was also reporting problems with a 
Lite-on drive 
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107955822109371&w=2).
