This may be a terribly stupid question, if so pls. just tell me  :)
I assume read-ahead requests go elsewhere?  Or do we assume that someone
is waiting for them as well?
If we assume they are synchronous, that would be rather unfair
especially on multi-user systems - and the 90% accuracy that Rik
suggested would seem exaggerated to say the least (accuracy would be
more like 10% on a good day).

Just a quirk; NFS file servers.
The client does read-ahead - the nfsd on the server-side will wait for
the read request, thus the read is synchronous...  But it's not.
