well, acpi-cpufreq appears to work here. The only drawback is that BIOS 
supports only 2 states (750 and 500MHz) while Toshiba HCI interface can 
switch between 8 levels; unfortunately I have no idea what frequencies they 
have.
Is there any utility to measure actual CPU frequency? If I can determine real 
speed, I could try extend DSDT to support other levels too.
TIA
