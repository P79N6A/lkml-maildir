On the other hand, Andreas suggested only marking it once every 32 calls,
but that required a helper variable.  Statistically, jiffies%32 should
end up about the same as a helper variable %32.
This of course, if just calling mark_page_accessed() is actually expensive
enough that we don't want to do it unconditionally.
