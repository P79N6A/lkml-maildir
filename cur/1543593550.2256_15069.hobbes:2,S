Subject: [PATCH] timer vector printed inconsistently
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When trying to debug a recent problem with some interrupt routing,
I found the output to be confusing...  The TIMER vector is
printed with %d, but when the APIC tables are printed, the vector
is printed using %02X.  This was particularly confusing in this case
because the TIMER vector was 49d (0x31) and vector 0x49 was
assigned to a different APIC pin.
The following patch causes the TIMER vector to be printed the same
way as the vectors in the APIC table (See line 786 of my io_apic.c)
I'm not a subscriber of the kernel mailing list, so please CC my on
any replies.
