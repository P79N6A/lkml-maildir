1) Describe what you're running. (your workload)
2) Describe what you're feeling. (eg "interactivity is crap when I run
this or that thing", etc) 
If we need more info than that I'll request in private. 
Also send this reports to the linux-mm list, so other VM hackers can also
get those reports and we avoid traffic on lk.

By performance you mean interactivity or throughput?

If we need more info, we will request.

Just do what I described above.
