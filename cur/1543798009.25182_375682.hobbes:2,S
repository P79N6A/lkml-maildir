Subject: [PATCH 4/6] FS_NOATIME for ocfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

OCFS is only in -mm so far, so here's a separate patch for the
FS_NOATIME in ocfs in case this patchkit goes in before ocfs is merged.
Although I think ocfs should still go into 2.6.15 a an additional driver
that stands on it's own..
