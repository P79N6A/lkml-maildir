If someone is looking for something to do, it would be incredibly
value to make it so that all arches support this, and in particular
get right the case of mmap()'ing the PCI host bridge.
If this were done, the PCI domain code in xfree86 could be enabled
for all Linux platforms, not just the ones that have this implemented
properly.
