Subject: TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE too low causing dataloss on too fast serial lines?

hi!
I tried implementing 1Mbit irda driver as a tty (same as serials
are). I _think_ I've hit the limit of TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE. Is it
possible? I assume flipbufs are flushed every 10ms or so (am I right?);
in such case situation is pretty bad: that means 50K/sec max and
modern serial ports can do up-to twice as much. From reading sources I
_think_ that TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE can not be easily increased....
Any ideas?
