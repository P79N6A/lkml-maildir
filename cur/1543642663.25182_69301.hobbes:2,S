Hello,
Since my recent harddisk problems I had to reinstall my entire linux. 
The only hardware change in the system is that the two harddisks have been 
swapped on the ide cable (jumpers have been changed accordingly).
Since then if I ever attempt to access the cdrom (which is used through 
/dev/sr1 using ide-scsi) i get an oops. After that, I get errors from the 
SCSI layer talking about timeouts and retries.
I've since then switched back to vanilla 2.4.19 which works fine with me. The 
-ac patches don't.
Before the harddiskproblems it worked correctly.
I'll see this eve to cause, ksymoops and send in an oops.
