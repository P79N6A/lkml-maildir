  This is strange. When you do iget() on some inode an i_count is incremented
and inode can't be deleted from disk until i_count is non-zero. Only when
inode is unlinked and last user does iput() inode is really deleted. But this
messages from ext2 say the inode is already deleted => something is
wrong. Your filesystem is corrupted or your code is wrong somehow (I can't
just now imagine how, but it might be possible)... No matter what case this
is I would run fsck on the filesystem...
