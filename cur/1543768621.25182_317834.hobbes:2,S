It didn't produce anything interesting.  For some reason the console output
stops when start_kernel() runs console_init() (I guess it all comes out
later) so the machine is running blind when we run kmem_cache_init(). 
Irritating.  I just moved the console_init() call to happen later on.
It's going BUG() in kmem_cache_init()->set_up_list3s->is_node_online
because for some reason the !CONFIG_NUMA ppc build has MAX_NUMNODES=16,
even though there's only one node.
Doing
#define is_node_online(node) node_online(node)
unconditionally fixes that up (your patch shuld be using
for_each_online_node() everywhere?) but it oopses later - I think it's the
first time kmem_cache_alloc() is called.
