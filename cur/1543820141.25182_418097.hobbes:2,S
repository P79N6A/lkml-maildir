A crucial point here is that the 'ln' and the actual exploit don't
have to be firmly attached to each other...
If you can get *any* unconfined user to do that 'ln' (Hmm... have you checked if
your tar/cpio/pax/etc have been patched to prohibit this when you extract an
archive?), then the exploit can be run *even in a domain that can't do the ln
that set it up*.

Unfortunately, in the *real* world, "unconfined user accidentally runs
malware that sets up the conditions for a later exploit" is an actual
real problem.  I'm sorry to see that it's just swept under the rug as
"not interesting".
Now, if you changed "not interesting" to "so damned hard we couldn't figure
out how to deal with it", I'd have a bit of sympathy for the position... ;)
