Slight correction/expansion -- don't do _software_ mixing. Some cards can do 
hardware mixing and in that case, "hw:N" or, specifically "hw:N,0", "hw:N,1" 
and so on devices are available as hardware mixed devices.
Try a cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/info and check the "subdevices_count" for 
the number of hardware mixed playback devices you have available. If it's 1, 
your card should've been configured (by ALSA itself) to use software mixing 
by default and if it's higher than 1, it should not have been and will use 
hardware mixing...
