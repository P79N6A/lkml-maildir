OK, so kernel 2.4.7-13 has a VM bug when running OOM. There are
two possible approaches to getting rid of this bug:
1) upgrade to a kernel which runs ok when pushed near OOM,
   like 2.4.17 with my -rmap patch ... but if you do run
   OOM with the newer kernel (a bit harder with 2.4.8 and
   newer) your JVM will still be killed
2) add more swap or ram to the machine, so you have space
   for the program you're trying to run

As you can see, you're really running OOM here, with very
little memory available for cache or buffers. You probably
want to add more swap space and/or ram in order to get
performance.
