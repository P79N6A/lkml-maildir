Mine are in alphabetical order but some of the early merges shuffled
stuff a bit.
The only case the link order matters here is with the generic and legacy
drivers. No chip specific libata PATA/SATA driver has overlapping PCI
identifiers between two drivers except for Jmicron, and that
distinguishes precisely by the function number.
Also its dangerous to assume "pata_*" is a PATA driver, it may be SATA
with a bridge chip, and in some cases like the ATI this is quite common.
