If I compile the 8139 ethernet support as a module (as I always did - 
module name >> 8130too) I will get an error in make modules_install. 
However, if I build it in the kernel it will work just fine. The problem 
is that now when I try to do a simple mii-tool -F 100baseTX-FD eth0 
(because my eth always stats at 100 Half duplex) I get this error:
SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth0' failed: Operation not supported
What should I do?
