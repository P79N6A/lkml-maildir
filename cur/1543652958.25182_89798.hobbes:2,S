This is now done, in response to your original comments.

Right, but look at the flip side ... once that bug has been logged
in bugzilla, the person who would have emailed lkml now has an easily
searchable interface, and could have found the bug, found out what the
patch for it was, and fixed it themselves, without ever bothering you,
lkml, or anyone. I'm not saying that'll happen 100% of the time, but 
it should help overall ... will just take a short period whilst data 
builds up.
