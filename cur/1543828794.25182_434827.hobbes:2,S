What puzzles me is how are we supposed to up(&nd.dentry->d_inode->i_sem) if
dentry->d_inode can become NULL ? simply by keeping a copy of it ? I thought
that the down() protected the whole thing, but may be that's stupid anyway.
I've been running rc1 without this patch for a few hours and during kernel
compiles without a problem, so I'm not sure about what to think about the
other changes which were apparently harmless too :-/
Well, if I resume it right, we only need to merge your patch and mine and
it *should* be OK.
BTW, I've been reviewing the PaX patch and found *at least* one patch
that should be merged (fix for oops). I'll send it separately, and it's
queued in -upstream.
Cheers,
Willy
