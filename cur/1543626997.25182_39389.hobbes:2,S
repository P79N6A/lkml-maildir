I disagree.  A filesystem has a certain set of semantics.  There are numerous
types of filesystems, each of which implements that set of semantics (and
possibly additional ones as well) in a different way.  This is a classic example
of a situation where oo style programming can be useful.  There are many cases
where C code is in essence implementing virtual functions using function
pointers.  C++ allows the compiler to do the hard work of keeping track of the
virtual functions.

C++ has tigher constraints on code than C.  This can allow a compiler to
generate better code because it has more knowledge about what is going on.

Your example is needlessly complex, and I'm sure you know this.  A more
realistic comparison would be:
cout << "Hello World!\n";
Now I don't for a moment think that we should go and convert everything to C++. 
But I do think that certain features of the language can be useful, and that
there are cases when OO style programming makes the code easier to read and
understand.
