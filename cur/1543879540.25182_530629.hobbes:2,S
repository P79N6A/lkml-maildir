Yeah. Note that there are some subtle but crutial differences between 
PlugSched (which Con used, and which i opposed in the past) and this 
approach.
PlugSched cuts the interfaces at a high level in a monolithic way and 
introduces kernel/scheduler.c that uses one pluggable scheduler 
(represented via the 'scheduler' global template) at a time.
while in this CFS patchset i'm using modularization ('scheduler 
classes') to simplify the _existing_ multi-policy implementation of the 
scheduler. These 'scheduler classes' are in a hierarchy and are stacked 
on top of each other. They are in use at once. Currently there's two of 
them: sched_ops_rt is stacked ontop of sched_ops_fair. Fortunately the 
performance impact is minimal.
So scheduler classes are mainly a simplification of the design of the 
scheduler - not just a mere facility to select multiple schedulers. 
Their ability to also facilitate easier experimentation with schedulers 
is 'just' a happy side-effect. So all in one: it's a fairly different 
model from PlugSched (and that's why i didnt reuse PlugSched) - but 
there's indeed overlap.

yeah.
scheduler classes are also useful for other purposes like containers and 
virtualization, hierarchical/group scheduling, security encapsulation, 
etc. - features that can be on-demand layered, and which we dont 
necessarily want to have enabled all the time.

thanks! :)
