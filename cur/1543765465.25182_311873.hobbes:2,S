Maybe try growisofs -dvd-compat -dvd-compat -Z /dev/sr0 .... like it suggested.
Maybe the drive's firmware doesn't support the modes normally expected
by growisofs.
growisofs has some odd options in the source code, and the authors on
the cdwrite list may be able to help.  I think it is starting to look
like bad firmware or a defective drive.

Well I am not sure it's the media either.  I think the drive isn't quite
up to the specs growisofs expects.  The authors may be better able to
answer that.  They also have some tools they may ask you to run to ask
the drive what features it has so they can see if the drive is a bit odd
or not.
> Starting to seem like a wise choice...
I got the PX716A a few weeks ago while they had a $30 mail in rebate.
Made it not much more than buying a lesser drive.  Unfortuantely that
expired at the end of March.
On the other hand, not having to run around trying weird things,
wondering if my media is bad, I just burn discs.  Sometimes it burns 8x
media at 2x if it doesn't think they are high enough quality, but it
burns them right each time.
