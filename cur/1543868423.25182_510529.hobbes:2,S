So to summarise, we have some code somewhere which is causing a NULL
pointer deref in uart_startup().  If we remove some code, the NULL
pointer deref stops happening.
And that's about the sum total of the information we know.  We don't
know precisely where the NULL pointer deref occurs, and we don't know
what's causing it.
It doesn't sound like there's much understanding of the problem at hand. ;(

I guess so, but how does the user know whether they need this enabled or
disabled?

Maybe adding some delays in that bit of code?  I'm sure you've already
thought of that though.  Since no one has a proper understanding of the
problem, the only suggestions possible are mere shots in the dark.
