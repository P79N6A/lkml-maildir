Just a data point, I have several Red Hat 7.1 boxes installed in various 
production environments, uptimes of 150-200 days so far with no end in 
sight... most are running the official 2.4.3-12, but I have been installing 
either the RH 2.4.9 update or 2.4.18pre2-aa2 on servers whenever there is 
occasion to reboot.
