Okay, first off why are you using a list linked through page->private?
page->list is fully available for such tasks.
Second, the if (key == NULL) check in hugetlb_release_key() is bogus;
someone is forgetting to check for NULL, probably in
alloc_shared_hugetlb_pages().
Third, the hugetlb_release_key() in unmap_hugepage_range() is the one
that should be removed [along with its corresponding mark_key_busy()],
not the one in sys_free_hugepages(). unmap_hugepage_range() is doing
neither setup nor teardown of the key itself, only the pages and PTE's.
I would say key-level refcounting belongs to sys_free_hugepages().
