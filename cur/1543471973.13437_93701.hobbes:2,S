Subject: [PATCH]: NCPFS for 2.0.37pre3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1998/12/15/160

Please test this patch to allow include it to the 2.0.37
(we are using this patch for 1 year now without problem in heavy 
load - WWW pages are on NW server, etc.):
ftp://ftp.spsselib.hiedu.cz/pub/linux/local/ncpfs-2.2.0-kernel-
2.0.37pre3.gz
This patch apply to linux-2.0.36 with Allan's 2.0.37-pre-patch-3.
There is no change in code since 2.0.33 (maybe longer).
Major features:
  - packet signing
  - OS/2 namespace
  - NFS namespace
  - mounting subdirs from a volume
You have to use new ncputils to utilize these features from:
(this is the primary site for ncputils, there is patches for older 
kernels too):
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/ncpfs-2.2.0.11/
The author of this patch is P. Vandrovec, but he is no longer 
working on this patch for 2.0.x kernels. He moved himself to 2.1.xx.
