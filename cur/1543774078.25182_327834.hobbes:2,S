Btw, if the patch contains rename/copy-patches or mode updates, you _need_
to use git-apply, since regular "patch" doesn't know about file modes and
can't handle file renames or copies.
Now, the rename/copy patches are easy to avoid by just not asking git to
generate them (so they'll show up as just straight file creates, with a
delete of the old file for a rename), but the file mode part in particular
is useful as more than just a way to create smaller (and more
human-readable) patches.
