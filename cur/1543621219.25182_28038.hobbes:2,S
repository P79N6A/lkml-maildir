Well that's odd.  Perhaps something is configured differently.
Please do this:
	make bzImage
Near the end of the build, see the line 
	ld -m elf_i386 -T  <lots of .o files> -o vmlinux
delete all the .o files which appear that command line.
Now, run
ld -m elf_i386 -T arch/i386/vmlinux.lds $(find . -name '*.o') 2> /tmp/1
Now, go through all the junk in /tmp/1 and search for the text "discarded".
It will mention a filename.   That's the info we want.
Thanks.
