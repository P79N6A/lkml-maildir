The problem (as Trod said) is that the cache only gets flushed if
find_fh_dentry(...) is called.  So is the server is not accessed
then the cache never gets flushed.
I see three ways to solve this problem:
 1. have a user daemon make a system call periodically.
 2. have a user daemon send a signal periodically
 3. have the kernel call a subroutine periodically.
To me 3. is the best solution, but I don't know how to set
an alarm in the kernel.
  I'll keep looking.
