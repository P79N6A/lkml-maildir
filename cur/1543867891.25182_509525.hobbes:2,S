There's no interface for this right now, but we can easily add one in a
backward compatible way. This also will not prevent a dyntick kernel from
running on an older Xen -- the guest will then receive to many timer
interrupts, but that should only be a performance concern fixable by
upgrading the hypervisor component of the system.
