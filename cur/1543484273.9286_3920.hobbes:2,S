I don't understand why Linux is taking so much flack here.   Going from 2.0
to 2.2 is a MAJOR CHANGE.  Hell, even Solaris 2.4 programs don't run properly
under Solaris 2.6 (and not even under 2.5.1 - try out the Lotus Notes 4.0
client, for example).
Even with the ..x patches, the user has a choice; backwards compatibility with
BUGS, or a bugless mode with the possibility of an unfortunate binary side
effect.  Heh, Alan, for each of your patches have a kernel compile configuration
option "enable XYZ bug mode for compatibility" :-)
And anyway, this isn't linux-scsi related...
