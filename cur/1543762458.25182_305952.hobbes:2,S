Subject: [2.6 patch] fs/smbfs/request.c: fix NULL dereference
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/24/314

The Coverity checker found that if req was NULL because find_request 
returned NULL, this resulted in a break from the switch, but req was 
later dereferenced (look at the last line of this patch).
