It works fine on grub.  I use grub.
make install is completely installation agnostic.  It just calls 
/sbin/installkernel with the paths of the various files.  On any sane 
distribution this will work.  If it doesn't it's only a shell script 
with a few symlink & copy commands in it... just write your own.
