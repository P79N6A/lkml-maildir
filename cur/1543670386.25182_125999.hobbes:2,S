Hm, I thought someone tested this previously.  Do you have a test case
for this that I can try to duplicate the problem for?
Also, your patch will not apply against the latest (2.4.21-pre7) version

p.s. I'd recommend sending these kinds of patches to the linux-usb-devel
mailing list too.  That's where most of the Linux USB developers are.
