Did you actually read the previous email? 
Same config file? Same tree? same compiler (gcc 2.95.4?)

I think we're talking about different things:
1. Need to isolate what's causing the 6s improvement you're seeing.
Can you generate profiles & time output for before and after the patch,
and describe the test you're running (presumably make -j).
2. SDET degredation. I'll try the additional patch you sent out on that.
