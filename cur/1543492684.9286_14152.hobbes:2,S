Hi Richard,
	First off, I got a bit hot-headed because the first thing I hear
from you is to just say my idea is 'just plain broken' 'just cannot be
used' 'end of story.'  I prefer more colorful expressions, like 'broken
ass' ;-)  In any event, I think there are still issues to be discussed.

We're talking about a transition to a system where the admin can delegate
by a means other than 'sudo'.  I'm just talking about flexibility and
correctness.

No, execute permissions are in place for the file owner only.  I'm
jschmoe, a trusted junior admin with a few caps.  I wrote a program w/
caps that I don't want anybody else to read, write or execute.  The
correct way to do this is give the perms I've shown; I could also use my
private group, but that just exposes another problem in this hack.

I thought this was kind of rude.  I probably should have waited an hour or
so before responding.  Oh well, lessons learned.

I just prefer to get some real 'show-stopper' examples where you have
already asked the question 'can this show stopper be worked around in an
easy, clean, UNIX-like way?'

That's fine.  I think you and I are aiming at different goals.

We're not _granting_ capabilities, we're stripping away all the unneeded
capabilities.  Otherwise it runs 'full bore'.  Are you saying that portmap
should be run with _all_ capabilities?  Or do we need to cripple root
before running it?  With setuid0, to strip away unneeded caps you need to
make it, well, setuid0.

and under the modified kernel will only run with the caps it needs.

Not grant, strip.

Admit it, you can be rude too.  In any event, my portmap binary has a
'permitted' set with only the caps it needs, and an empty 'inheritable'
set.  So I'm stripping away caps.

Are you saying the kernel can apply some of the privs fields to a
non-setuid-root binary?  'Inheritable', I guess?  Have you looked at the
queer way a new process get's it's caps and how it relates to inheritable?
[snip bad named example]
Hrm; I made an error in logic here.  Sorry to have wasted your cycles on
this one.  But you still bring up a point:

You've still taken a binary which was formerly _not_ setuid root, and
_made_ it setuid root.  This is broken for backwards compatibility, across
nfs filesystem, ... I think having named now setuid root is a Bad Thing.

I think one fundamental disagreement between us is that you still think of
root as all powerful.  To me, setuid root just means 'give this program
root's rights in the fs'.  I reallize that, if Linux ever goes to a true
implementation of capabilities, this will be a bit of an ugly transition
in thinking.

Well, this is a consideration for the lead admin; anyone with junior
admins beneath her should understand what she's doing when she checks
'capelf hack' in the kernel configuration.

I've made, as far as I know, two assumption: if a file has capabilities in
the headers, it will be marked setuid-root.  It looks as if this
assumption may be wrong?  Also, I assume we want something pretty darn
close to _true_ capabilities support.  So I may be wrong in both cases.

Because your first response to me was to wave off my ideas with impunity
and somewhat rudely.  So I thought, geez, do I need a patch in the kernel
before this guy will give me a second thought?

Are you referring to the older kernel problem?  Have you considered
possible user-space solutions?

Ok, you want an IRIX machine (for example) to be nfs-serving elf binaries
to a Linux machine, and you want the Linux machine to respect setuid 0
(and therefore your capability scheme) on the nfs mount.
I guess the problem is, the IRIX machine actually makes _use_ of the
sticky bit for something else?  But, in the traditional use of sticky
bits, the IRIX machine probably won't be executing the Linux binaries, so
won't keep them in virtual mem.  Maybe with binary compatibility, but this
is starting to get a bit far out for me.  Or maybe I misunderstand what
you're saying...
