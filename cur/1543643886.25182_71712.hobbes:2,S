I like request/servers and state machines. I also think that there
may be some smart ways to fold multiple threads into one. And there is 
nothing wrong with userspace threading libraries.

There is a simplicity acquired by pushing the complexity to somewhere else.

Because Linux does not provide an easy and highly efficient API for 
building state machines and because even if it did, a crappy threads
model that runs on NT as well as Linux is more attractive.

Huh?
Just for information, don't try to apply asymptotic analysis blindly to 
bounded conditions.
