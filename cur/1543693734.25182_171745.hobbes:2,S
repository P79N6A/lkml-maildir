You need at least enough warning to get out of critical sections (e.g.
holding a spinlock) and dump registers out to memory. i.e. as long as it
takes to schedule out whatever's currently running on the thing.
... and unless you want to start enforcing realtime bounds, the answer
to "how long do you have to give the kernel to do it?" is "forever".
In practice, it won't take forever, but no finite time is enforcible.
