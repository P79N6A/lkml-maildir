      Implementing something based on someone's random
      publications is not a good idea for an operating as
      pervasive as Linux.
And to make my point even more clear, most of the algorithms we have
adopted were adopted based upon real testing done in real life
environments.
Take a good hard look at any other OS you think is "pervasive" and I
guarentee you they implement things like rate halving and the various
SACK algorithms.
