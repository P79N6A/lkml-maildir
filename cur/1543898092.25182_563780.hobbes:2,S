Is that just a performance problem, or can data be lost here?  It depends
on the meaning of "blat": writeback?  invalidate?  More details, please.
I'm dyin here and nobody will talk to me.  If the kernel is already doing
these things, why aren't we already buggy?  Is it because we don't actually
modify the pageframes of these dma-to-from-kmalloced pages?  But we were
thinking of doing so in the future?
