This is going to clash head-on with oprofile. However, the two systems
are both useful in their own rights: oprofile isn't useful for
interstitial timings as described above, whereas perfctr isn't really
designed for system profiling.
So I suspect the simplest solution would be to make the config options
for them exclusive. Comments ?
