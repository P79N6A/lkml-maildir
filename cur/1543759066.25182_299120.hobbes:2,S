Right.  My point, and I think Jeff's, was that being extra careful for
the 'even' releases and waiting around N days to see whether someone will
finally test the -rc and see that it is broken impedes the whole process.
Getting more people to test is not necessarily a function of the wait
duration.

When Arjan started testing 2.6, he set up a repo, and FC1 users at
the time could just pull rpms from that repo.  I and many others did it.
Currently I'm rolling my own, so I haven't been consistently testing
your Fedora kernels, rawhide or update, but I occasionally do the "grab
the SRPM from Rawhide and rebuild it on FC3"-thing for my laptop.  I
think that we should institutionalize that.

I've watched you periodically announce "hey, I'm doing an update for
FC3/FC2, please test" on the mail list, and a handful of people go test.
If we could convince many of the the less risk-averse but lazy users to
grab kernels automatically from updates/3/testing/ or updates/3/unstable/
as part of "yum update", and have a way to manage the plethora of (even
daily) kernel updates by removing old unused kernels, then we'd only
have to convince them *once* to set up their YUM repos, and then get them
to poweroff or reboot [or use a Xen domain] occasionally. :-)

Yes, this is miserable, and exacerbated by the inability of almost all
distros to deal with multiple installed versions of packages, or easily
roll back changes, which crimps my argument w.r.t. wider testing, since
the typical user willing to test while otherwise doing useful work wants to
be able to roll back easily if there is a serious problem.
The LVM packaging situation between 2.4 and 2.6 illustrated the problem
well; one couldn't boot back into 2.4 unless LVM1 and LVM2 userland
could coexist; I spent time rolling packages back then to do just that.
In any case, kernel helper packages (udev, device-mapper, iptables, etc.)
need to be added to a "kernel+related" package repo.
Users could be encouraged to do more testing if they are provided
with a simple mechanism to snapshot, update, test, and then either
keep the changes or roll back.  I do this in UML with the COW tools.
Currently LVM2 has writable snapshots, but no easy way (at system boot)
to reintegrate the changes into the base from a snapshot, or "fallback"
to a snapshot.  Still, using Xen/UML/QEMU, it is not difficult to take
advantage of copy-on-write to update the kernel and other packages, then
boot the image to start a shell or web/ftp/mail/... daemon(s).  At least
that would exercise the non-hardware-related, (and for now, non-SMP)
parts of the kernel.
