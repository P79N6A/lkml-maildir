My old dte module addressed all of these by keeping an in-kernel map
of vfsmounts.  Ok, all the interesting ones - three of them are
solved just by appropriately using file->f_security.
Hardlinks are a pain, but you just have to make up your mind how to
solve them.  In selinux (i believe) the solution is "the first name to
match a rule wins" during labeling, and of course at run-time the labels
are taken from xattrs, and newly created files are based on parent dir
and creating process.  It may be solved in selinux, but since at some
point all initial files must be labeled based on pathname, it still is
an issue to be addressed.
I am curious to see how subdomain will solve these.  And LIDS.  Have
they switched to a install-time xattr labeling + file transition rules
scheme like selinux?  We'll see, it could be interesting.  (Or, it could
be uninteresting and completely wrong...)
