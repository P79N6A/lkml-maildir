One editorial correction: Our PCI host-controller modem is based on the
Mars DSP1646 or 1648, not the Venus DSP1673.  Venus modems include the
controller function, so require no special Linux code to work.
I'll forward these notes along to our developers, and let you know the
result.
The "sample hardware" is available quite cheaply from many sources,
although it can be hard to tell what really has Mars inside.  Here are some
brand name PCI modems containing Mars:
- Zoom 3025 (with early Windows V.92 code)
- Zoom 2925L for under $50.
- ActionTec DeskLink Pro PCI for $33.
