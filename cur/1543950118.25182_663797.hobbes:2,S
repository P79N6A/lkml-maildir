Then why do you have to make the api? Everybody knows how to user these 
syscalls :)
If its only this -> why use it? If it's not -> it aint simple anymore?

Imagine having a shared/joint household savings account with your wife, 
and taking money from it without your wife knowing and vice versa .. 
then at some point when you thought that you have some $5K to buy the 
new super duper laptop you dreamt about your entire life - surprise - no 
enough resources :)
This is somewhat the equivalent of multiple independent resourse 
managers :) It won't end well :)
Should they be expected to be adequate in doing their job, they cannot 
be independent since they manage a shared resource.
Regards,
Peter.
