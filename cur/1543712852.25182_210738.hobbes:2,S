Under common case, worked perfectly!  But there are always corner cases.
I can think of two ugliness:
1. very sparse hugetlb file.  I can mmap one hugetlb page, at offset
   512 GB.  This would account 512GB + 1 hugetlb page as committed_AS.
   But I only asked for one page mapping.  One can say it's a feature,
   but I think it's a bug.
2. There is no error checking (to undo the committed_AS accounting) after
   hugetlb_prefault(). hugetlb_prefault doesn't always succeed in allocat-
   ing all the pages user asked for due to disk quota limit.  It can have
   partial allocation which would put the committed_AS in a wedged state.
