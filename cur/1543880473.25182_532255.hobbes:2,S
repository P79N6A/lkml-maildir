Hindsight's a wonderful place isn't it :-) and, of course, it's where I 
was making my comments from.

I disagree.  The single priority array with a promotion mechanism that I 
use in the SPA schedulers can do the job of avoiding starvation with no 
measurable increase in the overhead.  Fairness, nice, good interactive 
responsiveness can then be managed by how you determine tasks' dynamic 
priorities.

I agree, it wasn't totally useless especially for the average user.  My 
main problem with it was that the effect of "nice" wasn't consistent or 
predictable enough for reliable resource allocation.
I also agree with the aims of the various heuristics i.e. you have to be 
unfair and give some tasks preferential treatment in order to give the 
users the type of responsiveness that they want.  It's just a shame that 
it got broken in the process but as you say it's easier to see these 
things in hindsight than in the middle of the melee.
