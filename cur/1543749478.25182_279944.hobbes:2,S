I'm not sure why anyone would bother ...
config COBALT_LCD
        bool "Support for Cobalt LCD"
        depends on MIPS_COBALT
those machines are never SMP.
However, looking at the driver, it doesn't seem to generate interrupts,
so I don't see what good disabling interrupts would do.  I think we can
simply remove the save_flags/cli/restore_flags from this driver.  It needs
a fair chunk of work though -- should be converted to use writeb instead of
                                        *((volatile unsigned char *)
                                          burn_addr) =
                 (volatile unsigned char) rom[index];

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
