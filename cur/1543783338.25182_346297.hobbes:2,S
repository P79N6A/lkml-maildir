Hi Alan,
It's other (non-orientation) texture state I had in mind:
- the texel format (OpenGL has over 30 possible texture formats).
- texture size and borders
- the filtering mode (linear, nearest, etc)
- coordinate wrap mode (clamp, repeat, etc)
- env/combine mode
- multi-texture state
It basically means that the driver may have to do state checks similar 
to this to determine if it can use optimized code.  An excerpt from Mesa:
          if (ctx->Texture._EnabledCoordUnits == 0x1
              && !ctx->FragmentProgram._Active
              && ctx->Texture.Unit[0]._ReallyEnabled == TEXTURE_2D_BIT
              && texObj2D->WrapS == GL_REPEAT
	     && texObj2D->WrapT == GL_REPEAT
              && texObj2D->_IsPowerOfTwo
              && texImg->Border == 0
              && texImg->Width == texImg->RowStride
              && (format == MESA_FORMAT_RGB || format == MESA_FORMAT_RGBA)
	     && minFilter == magFilter
	     && ctx->Light.Model.ColorControl == GL_SINGLE_COLOR
	     && ctx->Texture.Unit[0].EnvMode != GL_COMBINE_EXT) {
	    if (ctx->Hint.PerspectiveCorrection==GL_FASTEST) {
	       if (minFilter == GL_NEAREST
		   && format == MESA_FORMAT_RGB
		   && (envMode == GL_REPLACE || envMode == GL_DECAL)
		   && ((swrast->_RasterMask == (DEPTH_BIT | TEXTURE_BIT)
			&& ctx->Depth.Func == GL_LESS
			&& ctx->Depth.Mask == GL_TRUE)
		       || swrast->_RasterMask == TEXTURE_BIT)
		   && ctx->Polygon.StippleFlag == GL_FALSE
                    && ctx->Visual.depthBits <= 16) {
		  if (swrast->_RasterMask == (DEPTH_BIT | TEXTURE_BIT)) {
		     USE(simple_z_textured_triangle);
		  }
		  else {
		     USE(simple_textured_triangle);
		  }
	       }
          [...]
That's pretty ugly.  Plus the rasterization code for textured 
triangles is fairly complicated.
But the other significant problem is the application has to be sure it 
has set all the GL state correctly so that the fast path is really 
used.  If it gets one thing wrong, you may be screwed.  If different 
drivers optimize slightly different paths, that's another problem.
glDrawPixels would be simpler for both the implementor and user.
