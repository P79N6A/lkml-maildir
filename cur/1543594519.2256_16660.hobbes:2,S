Warning I've not looked at that particular driver and would concider
myself a Linux kernel newbie. 20 years kernel hacking but only 9
months Linux with two drivers under my belt. One of which I'm now
trying to get into the standard tree.

Some writers are good and some not so good. Personally I'd prefer an
ArrayLen style macro but some prefer to see it long hand. My usual style
would be to use the array size #def used to define the array. I'd shoot
whoever wrote digmix[9 * 6 * 2];  OK so I just peeked at the source :-)
I might be tempted to tidy this up whilst I was adding something
significant to the driver but not for the sake of it. If I tidied that
one up I'd have to change all the other occurances in a consistent manner,
seem like a lot of work for little or no gain.

I prefer the struct construct and this also demonstrates why it's best
not to fiddle just for the sake of it. You've changed the allocation
from the size of the struct into the size of a pointer.

const is better but frequently forgotten :-(

Perhaps the biggest one is when making changes follow the style of the
existing file. Style changes in midstream only add to the confusion.
Don't change layout rules or methods of doing things unless you are
prepared to update the entire module and justify the changes to the
original module author who has every right to be highly critical.
