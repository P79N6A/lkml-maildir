You can look all you want, just can not touch.
Simiar to the red light district in Holland, it costs alot to do more
than look throught the glass.

No it can not, by only using the headers as the functional API for that
snapshot verson of the kernel release, it is the standard means for
functionality.  If the macro is require for any driver and or one in the
kernel to function, and is listed in the headers, it is generally deemed
to part of the unportected API.
Again it is very simple declare, all modules which are not GPL and reject
loading, and we can watch the death of linux as nobody will use it.  Again
who cares, because it started out as fun for a Finn in 1991, and should
never be of use or value outside of academics.
All of the code monkeys here need to be equally exploited by all.  Some of
the best marketing pitchs to date for some of the big companies who claim
to be linux friends, their slogans translated:
Use our hardware with Linux, there are a lot of suckers out there with
talnet who will gladly help you with your support issues.  This reduces
our support costs because we cans send you to join the rest of the
monkeys, Pinocchio.
Harsh and reality suck, but I could not believe this is what is being
pitched at trade shows.
Later ...
