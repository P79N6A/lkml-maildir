Then you're in the situation where you have to narrow the bug down to
something more reproduceable for other people. Possibly very few people
on the list have 2.6.15 + asterisk + a sample to play + etc...
Try to strace asterisk when this happens for instance, try to remove
a lot of loaded modules and configured options from your system, then
you will finally reach a case where you can simply reproduce it with
a 10-line C prog without a complex setup. With those info, it will be
too complex and boring to try to reproduce your problem on any
developer's system.
