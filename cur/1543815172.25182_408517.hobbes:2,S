Hmm... This signoff exists because you are using some bit of earlier 
patches by me?
Typically the _node endings mean that one can specify a node number where 
to allocate memory.
Wont partial lookups like this complicate further work on the radixtree? 
Could you  get your speed optimizations into radixtree.c so that others 
can use it in the future?
