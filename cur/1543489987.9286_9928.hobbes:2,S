Subject: 2.2.3 lock with AppleTalk DDP...

This weekend I enabled AppleTalk DDP on my dual processor box with kernel
2.2.3 on it. It kind of works but seems to have some serious problems:
1) Get "protocol 0008 buggy" and "protocol 6564 buggy" messages (I'm not
sure about the second number but it was something like that)
2) It randomly locks the dual processor box solid when copying files from a
MacOS 8.0 box.
I'm using netatalk-1.4b2+asun2.1.3-1. Not that a user package should be able
to crash the kernel :)
There aren't any messages displayed when it locks... it just locks.
