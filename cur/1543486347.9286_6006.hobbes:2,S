Hi all!
Several programming (and reading) hours after trying to find an answer to 
my question I decided to write to this newsgroup.
I would like to know if the current kernel supports an asynchronous 
notification for FIFOs. I interpreted the collected information about this 
problem as follows: If I create a FIFO and open it from the client and the 
server, I can exchange data via that FIFO. In my book about Linux Kernel 
Programming there is a hint for using the async notification, the SIGIO 
signal will be set. But I do not get this signal on server side, when the 
client writes something in the fifo :-((((
Can anyone help me?

Here is what I implement on server side:
...
fd = open("/tmp/hello.fifo", O_RDWR);
ioctl(fd, FIOASYNC, &arg); // arg is 0
fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, FASYNC);
fcntl(fd, F_SETSIG, SIGIO);
signal(SIGIO, sig_io);  // where sig_io prints s.th to the stdout.
