It lets you unlink them. That's different from deleting, since the owner
may have his/her private link to that file.
Unlinking is changing the contents of a directory, and it's controlled by
the write permission of the containing directory.

Imagine a /tmp directory (writable by world) with user "a" creating a file
"foo", umask=077 and user "b" trying to do the same. User "b" will get
'file exists' if he tries to create it, and 'file does not exist' if he
tries to list it. He will go nuts.
BTW: YANI: That about a tmpfs where all-numerical entries can only be
created by the corresponding UID? This would provide a secure, private
tmp directory to each user without the possibility of races and denial-of-
service attacks. Maybe it should be controlled by a mount flag.

You can't do that if you have hardlinks. However, I missed the feature of
overruling file permissions in some special directories, e.g. anything
put under /pub should ignore umask and be a+rX.

ACK.

Which one? The bsd-style, sysv-suse-style, the sysv-debian-style,
the sysv-gentoo-style, the supervise-style, ...?

Smarter than recognizing the partitions by GUID?

Using "windows" and "smartly recover from problems" is strange.

And it becomes even more strange. Decent error messsages from windows are
as common as snowballs in hell.

«Some error occured. Press "OK".»
And if there is a help button, it won't.

"Just working" isn't easy if you have zillions of dependencies and even
more possibilities to choose from. You can e.g. make linux use a raid0
of a network block device and a loop-mounted file accessed over a ssh
session as it's root device (just in case if you you got bored of drilling
holes into your knees, pooring milk into them and raising fish in them.)
