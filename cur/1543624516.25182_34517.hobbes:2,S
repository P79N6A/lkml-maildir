We're not going to create a testing procedure that will find all bugs,
since that's essentially impossible.  On the other hand, I think we
all need to collectively take 24 or 48 hour off, spend the time downing
several <insert beverage here>, and see if anybody has a good proposal
that would catch 90% of the show-stopper bugs that have slipped through
so far in the 2.4 and 2.5 series, without complicating matters TOO much.
Here's a simple one:  a -rcN release has to sit there at least 96
hours before it gets tagged as "final".  That's something we've been
quite poor at so far:

So even in many cases where there *were* 2 or 3 day waits, they were
across a weekend - which means quite likely a lot of people didn't
test because they were *home* having *lives*.
Think about it.  "Just wait 96 hours".
