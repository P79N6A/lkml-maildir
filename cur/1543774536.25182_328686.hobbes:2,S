The radeon kernel module is only used for 3D support features, at the
moment there isn't any real support for r300 class cards for 3D (ether
fglrx from ATI, or r300.sf.net).
For 2D support you don't need any kernel drivers.. X should support
your card but you might have to set the ChipID ... but that is OT for
lkml....
