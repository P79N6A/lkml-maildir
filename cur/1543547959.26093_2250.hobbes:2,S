Linus, I 100% agree with you but I _do_ use kdb because I don't know the
Linux kernel as well as I ought to. So, I admit it is a "weakness
thing" and not a "strong weapon thing".
Whenever I understand something without kdb it turns out to be
fundamentally correct. If I fix something _with_ kdb then it turns out it
will need fixing again properly, a few months later when I _do_ eventually
come to understand what I am doing...
But sometimes having a quick fix is so enticingly pleasant :)
Ok, thank you very much for letting us know your opinion.
Regards,
Tigran
