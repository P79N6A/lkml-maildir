Subject: PROBLEM: Compatibility problem with C++, i386 & ia64 platform

1. Compatibility errors when including <asm/system.h> with g++ compiler on i386 and ia64 platforms.
If you want to use the memory barrier macros mb(), rmb() and wmb(), as defined in <asm/system.h>.
On i386 platform:
This will work if you use gcc, but not in g++, since the name of the parameter in the __cmpxchg(...) is new, which the C++ compiler will not accept. (new_val might have been a better choice ;-)
Function header
---
static inline unsigned long __cmpxchg(volatile void *ptr, unsigned long old,
				      unsigned long new, int size)
---
On Itanium 2 platform:
Compiling on Itanium 2 works if you add som typedefs and a define, which is normally defined when __KERNEL__ is enabled. 
Prepended rows to the include of system.h
---
#define __pa(x) x
typedef long s64;
typedef int s32;
typedef unsigned long u64;
typedef unsigned int u32;
#include <asm/system.h>
---
Maybe the system.h is not supposed to be included outside the kernel?
Is there a less crude way of getting hold of the macros?
Best Regards/JB
