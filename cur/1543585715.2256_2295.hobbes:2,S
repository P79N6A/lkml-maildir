Jeff, check the namespace patch - it simplifies this area big way.
Since it's independent from the namespace code I can pull these
parts into separate patch.
Basic idea: _always_ use ramfs (initially empty) for absolute root.
"real" root is overmounted atop of it. The thing being, by the time
when we deal with initrd, unpacking, mounting real root, etc. we
have full-blown fs context. I.e. we can call sys_mknod(), sys_mount(),
etc. I've pulled the late stages of boot into init/do_mounts.c and
had rewritten them - essentially into sequence of syscalls. The thing
became seriosuly simpler (not to mention the fact that it's not scattered
anymore).
If anyone is interested in seeing it as a separate patch - tell and I'll
do it; it's pretty straightforward.
