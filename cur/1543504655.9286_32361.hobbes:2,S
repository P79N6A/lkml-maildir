   Are there any potential problems in this?  I imagine that if I had a mounted
   file system and I deleted the partition then things could get nasty (but I
   don't do that sort of thing anyway).
Or if you moved the start or end points of the partition!
   Maybe the correct solution would be to make the kernel check whether we're
   changing any partitions that are in use - and only decline to re-read
   the table in that case.
This is probably the right long-term strategy.
