It's entirely possible the card has a different polarity for the phy bits 
as compared to the fibre card (Netgear) that the driver is already tested 
on.  Also, I've only managed to test on a cisco switch -- is there any 
other hardware you can test against (ie using the fibre cable for cross 
over) to narrow things down?  Enabling debug and dumping the status bits 
might hint as to what has to be changed.  Thankfully Trendnet seems to 
have programmed the subsystem id, so I'll be able to include the change 
automatically.
