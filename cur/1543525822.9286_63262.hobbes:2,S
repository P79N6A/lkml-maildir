there's a bug in the kernel cmdline parser, which i haven't had the time
to track down. try adding a harmless option to your kernel cmdline in
/etc/lilo.conf, like this:
vga=1
read-only
root=/dev/hda1
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14
	label=stable14
	append="profile=4"
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
then run lilo as usual, and reboot.  this will work around the parser bug.
