Subject: boot-up frame buffer console pets decapitated on scroll-up?

Using VESA 2.0 frame buffer text consoles, when I scroll back the boot
screen, it messes the penguin when scrolling up with Shift-PgUp. It
just copies the top text line contents all over where it should blank.
If we can scroll text, why can't we scroll the penguin?
