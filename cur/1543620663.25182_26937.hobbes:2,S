One possibility is to do something like:
ud2
.word __LINE__
.long 1f
.section __FILE__
.linkonce discard
1: .asciz __FILE__
.previous
Which will put each filename string in it's own section and let the
linker merge the duplicates.  I don't know how to wrap all of this up
nicely in a inline asm statement but perhaps someone else can work
out the remaining details.  Ideally I would put a prefix on the name
of all of the sections for easy processing, but string concatenation
doesn't work in asm :(
