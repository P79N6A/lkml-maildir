Thinking about it more, I wonder if Krysztof is bitching more about
the tab width of 8 characters?   I know that it ticks me off,
indenting by two spaces is plenty for me to follow the flow, along
with Emacs and braces closure indication.  
I'm constantly un-tabifying code and making my indents be just two
spaces, though I guess I should really just change my tab-width to be
2 consistently.
What do you think Krysztof?
