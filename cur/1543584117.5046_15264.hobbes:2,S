Thank you again for your help.  While I do seem to get more errors
with the ide-tape driver, I am also seeing some problems on further
examination which are common to both ide-tape and st over ide-scsi, so
perhaps I have a bad drive or tape.
When trying to mt eom, for example, I get

=============================================================================
What is the 11,3?  Where can I find these codes listed?  Why is the
drive having trouble finding the end of the tape?  I'll be testing
more tapes soon, but this definitely happens with at least several.
The mt command returned to the prompt with 'Input/ouput error'.
Many Thanks again,
