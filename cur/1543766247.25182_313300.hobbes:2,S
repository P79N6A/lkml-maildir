Subject: Crash when unmounting NFS/TCP with -f

Hi Trond,
I'm using NFS (v2) over TCP (in a SSH tunnel).
Each time the SSH dies before a umount NFS, I have to umount -f
and I get a crash (only sysrq works).
Actually, the crash occurs a few seconds after umount -f.
It seems that killing SSH by hand does _not_ lead to crash.
But a long network failure does.
I remember seeing this bug several times with all stable releases
from 2.6.7 to 2.6.11. I didn't try with earlier versions.
I didn't see anything in the logs (after reboot). But I can't be sure
there was nothing in dmesg since I didn't get a chance to chvt 1 and
see console messages before rebooting (with sysrq).
Do you have any idea how to debug this ?
Thanks,
Brice
