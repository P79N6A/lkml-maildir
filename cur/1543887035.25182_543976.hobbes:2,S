I suspected so. However the acpi and i2c section of the two config are
identical. I report the only selected options:
Power management options (ACPI, APM)  --->
  [*] Power Management support
  [*]   Software Suspend (Hibernation)
  ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support  --->
    [*] ACPI Support
    [*]   Sleep States
    <M>   Button
    <M>   Video
    <M>   Fan
    <M>   Processor
    <M>     Thermal Zone
    (0)   Disable ACPI for systems before Jan 1st this year
Device Drivers  --->
  I2C support  --->
    <M>   I2C device interface
    I2C Hardware Bus support  --->

The first column of lsmod list the same modules in both kernels. The
diff-ed dmesg is attached.
