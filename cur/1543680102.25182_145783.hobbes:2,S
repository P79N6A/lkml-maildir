Hi all,
I use Linux Kernel 2.4.21 vanilla version , and I have this problem.
I'd like to use the YWRAP option for VESAFB in order to speedup a bit 
the framebuffer , so I pass the "video=vesa:ywrap" option at the command 
line (i've tried to pass it manually and with lilo append="" ) but the 
framebuffer still using the REDRAW function , and does not respond to my 
commands . I've tried kernel 2.4.18 and it works correctly , and with 
2.4.20 it works correctly too , but with 2.4.21 series (i've tried 
2.4.21-ac4 too) doesn't works.
Thank u very much for your help
Bye
Marcello
