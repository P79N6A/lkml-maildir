No idea why the eeprom doesn't respond any more.  Maybe it's really
broken.  Note that the eeprom is read only at insmod time (and even
that for some cards only), thus there isn't a clear connection between
the crash and the eeprom issue.  It could have died earlied unnoticed.
The eeprom holds the PCI Subsystem ID, so without a working eeprom
bttv can't figure automatically what exact card that is (see the
"unknown/default" card name in the log) and maybe thats why does not
work any more for the card in question.  Thats should be easily
fixable using the card= insmod option.
