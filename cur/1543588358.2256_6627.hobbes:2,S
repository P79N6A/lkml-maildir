Not to be slow/dull/etc (I -really- appreciate the help here) but possibly
more stupid questions.
Is there anything out there to test/benchmark MMX ops? (Preferably with
reporting on MMX and equiv non-MMX ops, tunable memory bandwidth, etc.)
Also, I can try that same kernel w/ memory set to HCLK (pc100) instead of
HCLK+33 (pc133).  The ram is pc133, but who knows, it might work.  (I'm
pretty sure I had it at pc100 before with no change, but not positive.)
