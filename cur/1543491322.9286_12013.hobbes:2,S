Subject: Reboot when accessing IDE CD on SC450NX with 2.2.x

Hi,
The SC450NX (Quad Pentium II Xeon, 1 GB memory) reboots spontaneously
using any 2.2.x kernel I tried (2.2.3, 2.2.4 and 2.2.5) when accessing
the IDE CD-ROM (Toshiba XM6302B), connected as primary master (there
is only one IDE interface on that system).  This is the case for both
SMP and non-SMP kernels.  The kernel says something about a DMA timeout
for hda and then reboots spontaneously.
The 2.0.36 (non-SMP) kernel works fine with the same configuration and
accesses the CD-ROM without any problem.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
