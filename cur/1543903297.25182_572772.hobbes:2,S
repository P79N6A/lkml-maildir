Linus,
To save you from some merge conflicts, I rebased this readahead patchset
to 2.6.22-git5.
The following patches are based on yesterday's discussions, compiled and
tested OK.
smaller file_ra_state:
	[PATCH 1/8] compacting file_ra_state                                          
	[PATCH 2/8] mmap read-around simplification                                   
	[PATCH 3/8] combine file_ra_state.prev_index/prev_offset into prev_pos        
code cleanups:
	[PATCH 4/8] trivial filemap.c cleanups                                        
	[PATCH 5/8] remove several readahead macros                                   
	[PATCH 6/8] remove the limit max_sectors_kb imposed on max_readahead_kb       
support of interleaved reads:
	[PATCH 7/8] introduce radix_tree_scan_hole()                                  
	[PATCH 8/8] basic support of interleaved reads
