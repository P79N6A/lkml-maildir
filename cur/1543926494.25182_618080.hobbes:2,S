Hi Steve,
   Not sure I've ever posted on this list. Always looking to help out
at my low level.
   Anyway, I tried building the kernel. My 1st two attempts, done
running make menuconfig from scratch, didn't boot. I gave up on that
for now and tried using make oldconfig from my 2.6.23-rt1 kernel (I'm
so far behind!!) and ended up with this error. Not sure it's enough
for you to find the bug. If you want/need more or want the config file
let me know.
   I'm sure this is just me setting inappropriate bits but I figured I
might as well send along the info. >/dev/null if it's inappropriate
but let me know how to move forward if possible.
   As always thanks the the rt-kernel team for all you do.
Cheers,
Mark
