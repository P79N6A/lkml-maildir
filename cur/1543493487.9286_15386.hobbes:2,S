Please, don't play invalidation games with me. I presented a case for a
serious reconsideration of the security model used in Linux, based on
inadequacy (feel free to consider it as only perceived by me as such; your
opinion may differ) of the capability lists to support a number of fundamental
security principles. That *all* of the replies that I received (including
yours), together with the on-going discussions that try to circumvent various
implementation problems (for which you claim to be nonexistant), merely
confirmed my claims (even though probably some or many of the respected authors
of those mails would not agree with me on that; YMMV) is an issue in itself,
but as they say, one who believes needs no proof, one who doesn't can't be
proven to.
So I'll go back to my studies and you can continue with your implementation.
This way we may both learn some more.

[1] In other words, because of <your random capability list deficiency of the
day here>, you need to make a compromise between a large number of capabilities
(that is, fine grain security) and <your random form of efficiency here>. See 2
for results.
[2] In other words, you need to decide how you're going to cut total authority
into individual privileges in the capability list. See 1 for reason.
[3] In other words, if your security model sucks, you don't need fine grain
security. If you don't have fine grain security, your security model will suck.
