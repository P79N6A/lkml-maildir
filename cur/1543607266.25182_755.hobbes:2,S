Yes, that would solve the max_threads problem.  It should be fairly simple
to pick a reasonable number.
But my question is also about the other subsystems called from
start_kernel() that take memory size as an argument.  This includes
vfs_caches_init() which in turn calls dcache_init(), and buffer_init() and
page_cache_init().  I haven't dug down to the bottom of all these
functions, but I'm guessing they really want to base their calculations on
available normal memory and not high memory.
