2.6.13.3 works. I can compile an try 2.6.14-rc[1,2,3].
service time
{
    type        = INTERNAL
    id          = dgram_time
    socket_type = dgram
    protocol    = udp
    user        = root
    wait        = yes
    only_from   = 192.168.168.36 192.168.168.39
}
This setup worked for years now. The machine
(192.168.168.32) is the time-server and I have
chosen this setup to simulate and verify a real
world scenario.
/etc/ntpd.conf
..
driftfile /etc/ntp.drift
logfile   /var/log/ntp 
#authenticate no
server 127.127.8.0 prefer mode 2    # Meinberg ANZ_14 (Standart Telegramm)
server 127.127.1.1                  # Local clock in case of disaster
fudge  127.127.1.1 stratum 10       # Poor stratum for local clock
