Actually, I think by the birthday paradox there's a 50% chance of a collision
after generating 2^16 random numbers - but that assumes you're only ever
regenerating the generation number for one particular file.
get_random_bytes is pretty expensive, but there's some quicker versions used
for TCP sequence number generation which are probably worth looking at
(secure_tcp_sequence_number).  UFS gets around it by assigning generation
numbers at mkfs time and incrementing (or using a cheap RNG) it from there.
