Whoa! That "dying" drive that I had on my desk today, had a similar
error count. 
Speaking of "SMART": Does anybody know where to get the specs for
SMART?
The "product manuals" for the maxtor drives re-specify the ATA specs
by fully explaining every command, but when it comes to "SMART" it
just lists something like "READ SMART DATA: 512 bytes".
