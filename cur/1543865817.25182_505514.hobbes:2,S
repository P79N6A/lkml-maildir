And in fact, it is not just transient errors either. This problem can
add permanent corruption into the pagecache and onto disk, and it doesn't
even require two processes to race.
After zeroing out the uncopied part of the page, and attempting to loop
again, we might bail out of the loop for any reason before completing the
rest of the copy, leaving the pagecache corrupted, which will soon go out
to disk.
