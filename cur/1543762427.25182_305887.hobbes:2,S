Subject: [PATCH 2.6.12-rc1-mm2] relayfs: properly handle oversized events
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/24/249

This patch fails writes larger than the sub-buffer size and prints a
warning and stack trace when it happens.  I chose this over BUG_ON()
or silently failing since while it could probably be considered a bug
for an application to let this happen, it's not fatal and the user
would probably want to know (and change buffer sizes).
Andrew, please apply.
Thanks,
Tom
