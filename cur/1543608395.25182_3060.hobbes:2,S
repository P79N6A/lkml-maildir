Here is my startup:
Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.16, 14:36:54 Oct 27 2001
emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 4 model 0x21 found, IO at 0x1c00-0x1c1f, IRQ 16
ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: 0x5452:0x4103 (TriTech TR28023)
I should also mention this is kernel 2.4.13 with the latest cvs emu10k1 
driver.
I have no problems with it.
