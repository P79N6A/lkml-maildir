	EINVAL is per standards error code for exceeding filesystem
	addressability range.  EFBIG would have been more intuitive,
	I think, but this is what POSIX and Single Unix Specification
	tell us to use :-/
	You have 1k blocksize at your filesystem, and you are actually
	seeing 16 GB + epsilon worth of file offset range.
	... in the 32-bit front, it seems that during 2.3.* the systems
	will be able to address file offsets up to 512 * 4G = 2 TB.
	Not quite  sizeof(page_size) * 4G  that my initial code did..
	(intel has 4kB pages)

	That guess is correct, that old fsck DOESN'T handle it.

  From my 'try-lfs.c' program comments:
/*
 *  Execution of this program creates a large (looking) file at
 *  local system.  The execution of this program stops at offset
 *  which is just beyond what the local filesystem can support.
 *
 *  In case the local filesystem is EXT2 or UFS, the triply-
 *  indirection scheme can support up to following sizes per
 *  filesystem basic block size:
 *
 *   512        2 GB + epsilon
 *    1k       16 GB + epsilon
 *    2k      128 GB + epsilon
 *    4k     1024 GB + epsilon
 *    8k     8192 GB + epsilon  ( not without PAGE_SIZE >= 8 kB )
 *
 *  However, the basic block device layer can support only up to
 *  4G blocks of 512 bytes; being at safe side, lets say 2G blocks
 *  of 512 bytes:  1024 GB without epsilon.
 *
 *  The basic filesystem block size supportable at given system is 
 *  currently dependent on what the system page cache page size is.
 *  If the filesystem basic block exceeds of the system page size,
 *  the system does not work currently. (2.2.* series kernels.)
 *
 *
 *        bb = sizeof(basic block)
 *        B  = bb / 4
 *        MaxSize = bb * (B^3 + B^2 + B + 10)
 *                = bb^4 / 4^3 + bb^3 / 4^2 + bb^2 / 4^1 + 10 * bb
 *                = bb^4 / 64  + bb^3 / 16  + bb^2 / 4   + 10 * bb
 *  
 *        The primary term (bb^4/64) yields that 16 GB for bb=1k
 *        The 'epsilon' is all the rest, and is less than 1/250 of
 *        the primary term for 1kB, even less for larger bb values.
 *
 *
 *  The EXT2 (and UFS) can address up to 4G of "basic blocks", however
 *  that limit will likely to be beyond of other limitations from other
 *  parts of the system.
