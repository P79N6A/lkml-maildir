O.K, Tomasz your point is we can do aggregation in the kernel and cut 
down the amount of data that needs to be sent out from the kernel hence 
we don't need an efficient, low overhead mechanism like relayfs to get 
the data out of the kernel. Having relayfs doesn't prevent someone in 
aggregating the data in the kernel, so it is not an argument for not 
including relayfs in the kernel when it fills the need for those who 
needs raw data.
I am part of a team working on systemtap where we are are developing a 
tool similar to Dtrace that does some aggregation where appropriate but 
nothing like fancy statistics etc. We use relayfs in our systemtap 
project and  based on my reading of Dtrace paper they use exactly 
similar to relayfs buffering mechanism as well.
There are tools like itrace and Intel has one (i forgot the name) they 
would like to get the raw data into user space and do all kinds of  
fancy statistical analysis, visualization etc. Their value add is the 
analysis of the data. I am sure you are not suggesting pushing 
capabilities of those tools to the kernel, right.
As Steven Rostedt mentioned in his initial reply in this thread, many of 
us have written adhoc buffering scheme similar to what relayfs provides 
to debug kernel problems that happen after a long running test, if such 
facility already exists in the kernel everyone doesn't have to develop one.
I would like to see relayfs merged.
