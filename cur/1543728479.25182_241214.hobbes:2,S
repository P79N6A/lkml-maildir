Version 4.1 of the various single priority array scheduler patches for 
2.6.7 and 2.6.8-rc4 kernels are now available for evaluation.
This version contains a fix for a bug causing excessive promotion and an 
update of the staircase scheduler code to match Con's 7.I version.
1. [ZAPHOD] My proposed replacement scheduler which offers runtime 
selectable choice between a priority based or entitlement based O(1) 
scheduler with active/expired arrays replaced by  a single array and an 
O(1) promotion mechanism plus scheduling statistics with new simplified 
interactive bonus mechanism and throughput bonus mechanism:
2.6.7

and/or 
<

2.6.8-rc4 
<

2. [SC] Slightly modified version of Con Kolivas's staircase O(1) 
(version 7.I) scheduler with active/expired arrays replaced by a single 
array and an O(1)promotion mechanism:
2.6.7<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/patch-2.6.7-spa_sc_FULL-v4.1?download>
 
and/or 
<

2.6.8-rc4 
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/patch-2.6.8-rc4-spa_sc_FULL-v4.1?download>
3. [HYDRA] Runtime selection between staircase, priority based and
entitlement based O(1) schedulers:
2.6.7 
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/patch-2.6.7-spa_hydra_FULL-v4.1?download>
 
and/or

2.6.8-rc3
