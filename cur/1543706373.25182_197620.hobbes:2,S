I don't mind adding a few __KERNEL__ checks, but no I don't want code like 
this:

that is completely glibc-dependent and has no meaning in a kernel header 
file.
In general, anything that uses most of the kernel special magic defines
(__deprecated, __inline__, etc) probably should be inside #ifdef
__KERNEL__ anyway, so the kernel <linux/compiler.h> file should not need 
to define them. 
There are a few cases that look special, just because they touch data
structures that are actually visible to user space. That would be things
like "__packed__" and "__user" etc, which are used to tell something about 
the data structure.
So right now I just added a "#ifdef __KERNEL__" around the special parts, 
and did _not_ do the part about. We can add a few more #ifdef's around 
something else that breaks, but in general I feel that this is up to 
whoever merges the headers into user space.
