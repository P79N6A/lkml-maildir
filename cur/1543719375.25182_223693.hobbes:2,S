There are at least two possible ways of viewing "nice": one of these is 
that it is an indicator of the tasks entitlement to CPU resource (which 
is more or less the view you describe) and another that it is an 
indicator of the task's priority with respect to access to CPU resources.
If you wish the system to take the first of these views then the 
appropriate solution to the scheduling problem is to use an entitlement 
based scheduler such as EBS (see 
<
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ebs-linux/>
) which is also much simpler 
than the current O(1) scheduler and has the advantage that it gives 
pretty good interactive responsiveness without treating interactive 
tasks specially (although some modification in this regard may be 
desirable if very high loads are going to be encountered).
If you want the second of these then this proposed modification is a 
simple way of getting it (with the added proviso that starvation be 
avoided).
Of course, there can be other scheduling aims such as maximising 
throughput where different scheduler paradigms need to be used.  As a 
matter of interest these tend to have not very good interactive response.
If the system is an interactive system then all of these models (or at 
least two of them) need to be modified to "break the rules" as far as 
interactive tasks are concerned and give them higher priority in order 
not to try human patience.

The only way this will happen is if the interactive bonus mechanism 
misidentifies a CPU bound task as an interactive task and gives it a 
large bonus.  This seems to be the case as tasks with a 95% CPU demand 
rate are being given a bonus of 9 (out of 10 possible) points.
