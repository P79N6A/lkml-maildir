The dmesg message shows the mode selected. It should be the highest speed
but in one or two cases it selects UDMA33 only. I've fixed one of those
caused by us relying on a bit not defined in older controllers. We've
still got a case in the newer chips where BIOS setup doesn't set the
flags properly. Old IDE has a hackish workaround for that and I'll
probably end up porting it over.
