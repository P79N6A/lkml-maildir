Subject: [PATCH] update: preemptive kernel for O(1) sched

This is an update of the fully preemptible kernel patch for use with
Ingo Molnar's O(1) scheduler.
A few users reported oopses which I hope this update will address. 
George Anzinger and I also worked in some optimizations, most notably to
preempt_schedule.  More to come.
An updated preempt-kernel for 2.5.2-pre11:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/v2.5/preempt-kernel-rml-2.5.2-pre11-2.patch
An updated preempt-kernel for 2.4.18-pre3 + O1-H7:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/v2.4/ingo-O1-sched/preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.18-pre3-ingo-2.patch
Again, the 2.5 patch is for use with the stock version of Ingo's
scheduler.  Updates to his scheduler (H7, etc.) will be addressed as
they are merged.  Likewise, the 2.4 patch is for H7 only.  Other
versions are use-at-your-own-risk.
Any outstanding bugs please report.  Comments, patches, etc. welcome.
Full ChangeLog:
- more preempt-safe work for new scheduling functions
- mark PREEMPT_ACTIVE jump in schedule unlikely
- optimize preempt_schedule
- change value of PREEMPT_ACTIVE (0x40000000=>0x400000)
- (2.5 only) report preempt_count in /proc/pid/stat
- more comments
