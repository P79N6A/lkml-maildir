Gee, thanks.  It's not like some out-of-tree code doesn't _want_ to go
into the core kernel, but usually the time between some code being
developed and when it is included is lengthy (i.e. "this feature won't
be accepted until lots of people use it").
You can't claim that this has never been done (e.g. KERNEL_HAS_O_DIRECT,
KERNEL_HAS_DIRECT_FILEIO in 2.4 kernels).  For code that needs to handle
multiple kernel versions this makes life far easier and doesn't actually
hurt anything.  It used to be that you could use LINUX_VERSION_CODE for
this kind of check, but that breaks down quickly with vendor kernels and
the long development cycle.
Cheers, Andreas
