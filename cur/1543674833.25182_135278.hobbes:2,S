Tangenting a bit:
What does the block layer need, that it doesn't have now?
Each major subsystem right now is re-creating driver classes (floppy, 
tape, disk, ...) and that should be moved up and made more general. 
People should use /dev/diskX, /dev/floppyX, /dev/cdromX etc. without 
having to worry about IDE or SCSI or Jeff's SATA or whatever. 
Registration of majors/minors/CIDR/etc.  sysfs.  host 
controller-specific struct request_queue settings.  All these have to be 
recreated each time a new native block driver is created.  If you peer 
closely at some scsi drivers already merged, you see that too chose to 
translate SCSI rather than re-create all the junk necessary for a native 
block driver.  I'm definitely not the first to do what I did.  :)
When such code moves up into the block layer, then we can have a unified 
userland for doing class-specific activities, and then have a few 
bus-specific tools for the ATA- or SCSI-specific needs not met by 
class-general code.
As it stands now, I think a new native block driver creates more user 
confusion and pain than it solves, in addition to saving developer pain, 
if you consider all the device classes and userland tools and such that 
need writing.
