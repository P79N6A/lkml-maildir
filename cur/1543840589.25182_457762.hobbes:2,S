Ah, right. Thanks for pointing this out.

Yes, this was a rather hasty patch, I was mortified to find that I
missed a few changes and my patch-set would crash instantly someone
would try it.
The VM doesn't really like PG_private set on PG_swapcache pages, I guess
I'll have to rectify that and leave the NFS behaviour as is.
Will correct this in the next round.
Thanks for the feedback,
Peter
