Sure thing, that's a bug. But if you will consider the fact that the only
published interface to that table _did_ explicit check for the mountpoint
depth and refused to go if you were deeper than 1... And that was
documented. So, excuse me, but it sounds like "well, if they would clean
the chdir(2) up or change the data structures they could drop this check".
Well, duh. "If I tweak the /dev/kmem I can do everything, including
shooting my foot"...

You never dealt with s5fs, right?[1] In some sense ~-expansion can also be
considered as a very limited version of symlinks...
[1] You really don't want to know the effect on one's sanity caused by mix
of NetWhore 2.<something>, DOS boxen, couple of Xenix 5 ones and <shudder>
VENIX.
