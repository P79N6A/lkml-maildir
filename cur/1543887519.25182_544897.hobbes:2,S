It's interesting that compat_core_sys_select() shows this kmalloc(0)
failure but core_sys_select() does not.  That's because core_sys_select()
avoids kmalloc by using a buffer on the stack for small allocations (and
0 sure is small).  Shouldn't compat_core_sys_select() do just the same?
Or is SLUB going to be so efficient that doing so is a waste of time?

I don't think using the zero page that way would be at all safe:
there's probably configurations/architectures in which it is write
protected, but I don't believe that's a given at all.
But the principle is good: ERR_PTR(-MAX_ERRNO) should work,
that area up the top should always give a fault.
Hmm, but perhaps there are architectures on which it does not?
