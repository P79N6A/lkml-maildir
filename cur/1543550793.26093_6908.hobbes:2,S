Hello,
I have a customer who's getting tons of this msg in his LOGs:
kernel: protocol 0008 is buggy, dev hdlc0
The msg comes from net/core/dev.c, and this device is using the Frame
Relay protocol in drivers/net/hdlc.c .
What I'd like to know is:
- What exactly causes this msg?? It seems that it's printed when someone 
  sends a packet without the skb->nh.raw correctly set, but I couldn't
  find any driver under drivers/net that sets this.
- How can / should I solve this?? Should it be solved in the hdlc.c driver 
  or somewhere else in an upper level??
Thanks in advance for your help.
Later,
Ivan
