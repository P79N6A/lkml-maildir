Nope, this is certainly wrong.

Indeed, but that particular kind of test is subject to race conditions.  I
think the easiest way to fix this is to use the bookkeeping I added to get
process accounting correct (another thing that has to happen on the last
thread's death).  Start with this patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.9/2.6.9-mm1/broken-out/acct-report-single-record-for-multithreaded-process.patch
Then throw this one on top.
Thanks,
Roland

The session leader should disassociate from its controlling terminal and
send SIGHUP signals only when the whole session leader process dies.
Currently, this gets done when any thread in that process dies, which is
wrong.  This patch fixes it.
