M-Systems distributes something that is perfectly legal for an end user 
to use. Nothing prevents someone from linking anything they want into their
own copy of a kernel they will use themselves.
Unfortunately there was no easy way for anyone who wanted to distribute
a product with a DOC to distribute a kernel. 
M-Systems is in the process of creating a new driver that works as a module 
and contains no GPL code.
