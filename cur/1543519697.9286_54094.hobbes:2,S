You might not be aware, but the command line is pre-parsed by the memory
initialization code.  We put it into a 256 byte buffer, so if the command
line giving problems is less than 256 bytes, it is SEP.
As a help to the SEs of the world, knowing if the chopped options are being
used or not would be the first step of divide-and-conquer, namely,
determining if this is a reporting issue or a "real" issue.  You just
answered that it is a "real" issue.
Have fun, we are!!

Nay, this is not Someone Else's Problem, this is OP (Our Problem). By
"our" I meant the Linux Community in general, not the E820 Group.

I don't care if ramdisk works or not (well, I do which is why I use
bde-ramdisk patch) - I just put ramdisk parameters there as example.
And no, ramdisk does not see the parameters, i.e. it uses the defaults
(which is why I changed the default 4096K to 8192K - I need big ramdisks).
The /proc/cmdline displays saved_command_line[] (up to '\0'
terminator, see fs/proc/proc_misc.c:cmdline_read_proc() calling sprintf())
which should be an exact copy made by parse_mem_cmdline() very early. 
So, it is a problem and needs fixing. Btw, if you are not working on it -
that's good - I will take it as my weekend hacking project :)

Tigran.
