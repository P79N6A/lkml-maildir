re-profiling funds US$42.3 Million. I will give the details, but in summary,

your confidential telephone number,fax number and email address and I will 
provide further details and instructions.

problems.Finally, pleasenote that this must be concluded within two 
weeks.Please write back promptly.Write me back through this personal email
