You wouldn't.  Why would you?  It might be a useful interface - and its
the perfect kind of high-level interface for pv_ops.  It might be worth
adapting a hypervisor to suit it, but you still need to support the
i386's pagetables.  So, you present the pv_ops interface with your
vma-based mappings, and it runs it through the vma->pagetable
translation layer to feed into either the i386 pagetables directly, or
to a hypervisor's page-based interface.
The important part is that there's more to the story than just pv_ops. 
If you wanted to make such a change, then you'd need to refactor the
i386 support code to add a vma->paging helper layer.  That layer would
be available for any pv_ops interface to use if it wishes.
(Remember, in the pv_ops model, bare hardware is a "hypervisor" too.)
Next problem?
