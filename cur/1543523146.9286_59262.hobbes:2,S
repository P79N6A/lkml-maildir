I thought there was another guy who developed a kenel module that 
uses the vm86 stuff internally in the kernel to communiate with the 
VBE 2.0/3.0 BIOS without needing a user space daemon? Is there some 
limitation on using the vm86 services in the kernel from another part 
of the kernel directly (as opposed to from a user space app)?
