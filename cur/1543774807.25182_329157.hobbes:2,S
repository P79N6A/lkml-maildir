Subject: no output on serial console between probe and init

Prior to 2.6.12, I was experiencing garbage on the serial console as others
have mentioned in this thread:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0503.3/0491.html
 
Applying Phil Oester's quick patch 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0503.3/1061.html
indeed removes the garbage but now produces no output until init is started.
The patch that was integrated into 2.6.12 also exhibits the same problem.
Output to the console:
....
PNP: PS/2 controller doesn't have AUX irq; using default 0xc
PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:KBD] at 0x60,0x64 irq 112
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 8 ports, IRQ sharing disabled
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a NS16550A
< nothing for about a minute; should at least see SCSI init here >
INIT: version 2.86 booting
Activating swap.Adding 2104504k swap on /dev/sda2.  Priority:-1 extents:1
Checking root file system...
.....
This is on a relatively new Dell PowerEdge 1850; all serial output is at 9600
8N1.
Please CC any replies directly to me since I'm not on the list. Thanks!
