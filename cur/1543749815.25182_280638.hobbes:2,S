I also own one of these drives and am having the same trouble. I'd be willing 
to send you one of these drives if it comes to that. But I won't be able to do 
that until late January or so.
In the mean time, I'm going to have a go at debugging this myself. Do you have 
any pointers where I could start looking?
Thanks,
