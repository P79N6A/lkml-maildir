	AFAIK, there are two possible things you should do to avoid
	this:
	* hash the files in two (or more) directory levels;
	* if that's not possible, then use a filesystem whose
	  directory structure uses a tree instead of a linear list (it
	  seems -- but I'm not sure -- that reiserfs does this).
	[]s, Roger...
