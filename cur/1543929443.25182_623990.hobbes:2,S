 Maybe not a solution with loadlin, but is it working with the "tiny.exe" version
of Gujin?
 Download:
http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/g/gu/gujin/install-2.3.tar.gz/install/tiny.exe?extract=true
 and execute under DOS:
tiny c:\vmlinuz c:\initrd.img root=/dev/hda4 ro
 or maybe (to use an alternate way to collect BIOS data and the 32 bits entry point):
tiny /p c:\vmlinuz c:\initrd.img root=/dev/hda4 ro
 To have debug data on a DOS file named "DBG" you may download:
http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/g/gu/gujin/standard-2.3.tar.gz/lotiny.exe?extract=true
 and execute (with or without /p):
lotiny c:\vmlinuz c:\initrd.img root=/dev/hda4 ro
 If you want that debug on screen (screen will be messy, but the last few lines may
tell you the problem, and that is the only solution if the DBG file is not properly
closed by DOS), download:
http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/g/gu/gujin/standard-2.3.tar.gz/lodtiny.exe?extract=true
 and execute (with or without /p):
lodtiny c:\vmlinuz c:\initrd.img root=/dev/hda4 ro
 It may not help if you are stuck with loadlin, but may tell if it is a kernel problem
or a loadlin problem.
 More info for Gujin at 
http://gujin.org
 - current version v2.3
 Etienne.
