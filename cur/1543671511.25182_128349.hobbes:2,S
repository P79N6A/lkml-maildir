I'm not convinced --- I don't see much value in trying to preserve MAC
semantics over load/unload of different security modules, so for sanity
the important thing is just to be able to detect whether a security
xattr "belongs" to the current module or not.  That can be done with a
simple prefix in the xattr value itself.  Trying to make multiple MAC
labels coexist in different xattrs seems to have little use.
