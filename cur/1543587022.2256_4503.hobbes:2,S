cs is built into pcmcia_core.o, cb_enabler should still be there though. 
It's feasible that you only need cb_enabler for the old CardBus drivers, 
though - I'm not sure.

yenta_socket is the driver for CardBus i82365-compatible sockets.
i82365 no longer drives CardBus sockets, only PCMCIA.

The PCMCIA card ought to work. It's probably screwed up the IRQ routing - 
it no longer knows about some of the differences between CardBus and PCMCIA 
bridges. What exactly is the bridge in this machine?
