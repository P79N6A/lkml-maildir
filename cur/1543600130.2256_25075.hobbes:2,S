I'm also experiencing problems with Q3A and SB Live! It worked fine for
me before 2.4.9, but now with the "new" emu10k1 drivers it segfaults.
I already reported this earlier when 2.4.8-ac tree included the new
emu10k1 drivers but nothing came of it. Then Alan Cox reverted the drivers
and it worked fine. Now with 2.4.9 it segaults again.
I'll have to give the alsa drivers a try I guess.
