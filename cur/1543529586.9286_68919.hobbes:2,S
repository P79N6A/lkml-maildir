Previously, _any_ interrupt was let to progress.   That is, hardware
priorities were ignored by Linux.

So if we have a hardware determined higher priority level IDE than level
network, then it previously was the case that if the IDE driver was polite
and did an __sti, the network was assured of a relatively low latency. However,
the network now may need to wait until the programmed i/o completes.
Probably programmed i/o should rather happen in soft_interrupt space, but
with the current drivers it does not.

Ok. Ingo: does your "low latency" patch violate this rule?

Yes. I thought that the hardware worked like 8259s, but it is somewhat 
more sensible.

It's amazing how stubbornly hardware folks refuse to consider OS in their
designs.
