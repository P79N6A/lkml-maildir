Sorry, we did not respond to this yet :-)
Well, every process has at least one 'struct upid'. The only "cost"
I see with size [1] is having to subtract 1 in create_pid_cachep().
Besides, we create/initialize the 'struct pid' for the idle process
by hand (see INIT_STRUCT_PID in init_task.h).
If we set this size to [0] now, we would need to dynamically allocate
a 'struct upid' during early boot and attach this upid to init_struct_pid.
Or is there a easy way to attach a 'upid' to init_struct_pid, statically ?
