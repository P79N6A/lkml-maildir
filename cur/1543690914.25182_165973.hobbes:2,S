I thought we already got rid of that once: damn thing won't die...

I personally *HATE* the set_task_state()/__set_task_state() macros.
Simple assignments shouldn't be hidden behind macros, unless there's
something really subtle involved.
Personally, when there's a normal and a __ version of a function, I
use the normal version unless there's a real (performance or
correctness) reason.  (ie. I prefer the "think less" version 8).
I don't mind either way.  I'll roll it in the next update.
Cheers,
Rusty.
