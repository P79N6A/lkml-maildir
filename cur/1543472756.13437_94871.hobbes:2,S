I personally switched to Linux initially because it didn't cost me
anything.  I could only afford the $99 for Coherent, and barely that.
I knew immediately that Linux was better, and did things neither
Coherent or Minix could even early in the game.
I have always believed in software freedom, long before hearing of
GNU or much about UNIX, so Linux really just proved to me that I
was right about something and that it could really be a great thing.

Yep.  I'll note that most companies that do well, have a similar
model of development, they just keep it internal to them.
I think though, you have to realize that the free software world is
heavily subsidized by the non-free world.  Even Richard Stallman
came from the military-industrial complex since most of what he
initially knew was created or funded by the same.
Of course, a lot of the early efforts paid for by places like DARPA
were freely exchanged, and I think the move away from that is part
of what Stallman was motivated by.
