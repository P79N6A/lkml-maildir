I would _much_ prefer to have the USB drivers fully initialized with
"initcalls()". The only reason it's done like it is right now is that I
suspect the USB maintainers didn't realize that you can fully order the
initcall sequence by just chaning the link order. If I get a patch that
removes "usb_init()" from init/main.c, I'll apply it right away.
