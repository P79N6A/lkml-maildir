There was a thread called "PCI vendor id == 1 regression?" (Kai Ruhnau was 
the main reporter for that one). But looking back, it seems that one 
didn't hit the kernel mailing list, so I guess google cannot pick it up. I 
can forward all the emails if you want, but quite frankly, you don't 
really want to. It boils down to:
Stephen Hemminger:
  "There have been two reports with different hardware of the PCI vendor
   id of 0001 showing up. I got a report on sky2, and Francois saw similar
   problem on r8169.
   In one case, it happened only with 2.6.23 kernel, the correct id was
   returned by older kernels.
   This is a heads up, there may be a PCI problem. Or just
   some users smoking strange fall leaves."
And then one of the reporters:
  "Good kernel:
   02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 12)
	00: ab 11 64 43 07 00 10 00 12 00 00 02 01 00 00 00
   Bad kernel:
   02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Unknown device 0001:4364 (rev 12)
	00: 01 00 64 43 07 00 10 00 12 00 00 02 01 00 00 00"
and after I suspected it was mmconfig-related and asked him to try "lspci 
-H1" to force conf1 accesses from user space on a broken kernel:
   "Bare lspci gives the wrong vendor ID, lspci -H1 the right one."
for *one* single device.
In other words, just a single word in mmconfig was corrupt, but it was 
consistently corrupt.
The PCI device chain for that particular report was:
	00:00.0 Host bridge: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 7930
	..
	00:06.0 PCI bridge: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 7936 (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
	..
	02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 12)
and with the bug, the PCI vendor ID for that ethernet chip was 0x0001 
(bogus vendor) rather than the correct Marvell ID (0x11ab).
But as mentioned, there were other reports too of the exact same bug (with 
different PCI devices, but the same "vendor == 0001" bogosity).
Googling for
	lspci "Unknown device 0001:" mmconfig
shows reports like these:

which all seem to be due to this same bug with different cards (but the 
common theme seems to be an ATI northbridge).
The point is: mmconfig is easily broken. In surprising ways. The whole 
concept is stupid, it was badly done, and it has never gotten any testing 
what-so-ever until Linux started using it (and now Vista). And hardware 
that isn't tested is broken by *definition*.
And there's no point in blaming AMD. They may have gotten it wrong, but 
hey, so did Intel (with machines that lock up completely), so it's not 
like this is some "bad AMD" case. It's a "bad mmconfig" case.
