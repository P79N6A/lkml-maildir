The Red Hat 7.x kernel is very very old and probably the best way to get
the box happy is to run something modern on it - bugs get fixed by new
versions and there have been a lot of those for the kernel since 2.4.9.
If its Red Hat Enterprise Linux rather than RH 7.x you should probably
ask on the Red Hat rhel lists because (out of neccessity) the 2.1 VM is
very different to the base kernel and most of the folks who know and
care about it probably live on the Red Hat list.
