None, really. Why does md put it's headers in include/linux/raid ???
We can put them wherever.

Because it is getting crowded.  Why does every filesystem create it's own
directory in fs?  Maybe drivers/vm/md drivers/vm/dm drivers/vm/evms would
be better.  Again, we can put it wherever, this just seems like a logical
place.
