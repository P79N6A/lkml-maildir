filldir callback does that.  Please, read through fs/readdir.c and take
a look at the way error value is generated.
Return value of filldir has only one meaning - should we stop or should
we go on.  It's boolean, not an error value.
Errors are stored in data we are passing to filldir and picked by caller
of vfs_readdir() once it's done.
