| Everything now runs for more than a week without problems, so I guess I
| now have all bugs. I have split out the extra parameters to a separate
| patch, because they might not be needed for the standard kernel.

| for bug-free operation.

| 
| This patch fixes several problems in the ipaq.c driver with connecting
| and disconnecting pocketpc devices:
| * The read urb stayed active if the connect failed, causing nullpointer
|   dereferences later on.
| * If a write failed, the driver continued as if nothing happened. Now it
|   handles that case the same way as other usb serial devices (fix by
|   "Luiz Fernando N. Capitulino" <lcapitulino@mandriva.com.br>)

 I think you forgot to move the 'result' checking after the urb is
submitted.
