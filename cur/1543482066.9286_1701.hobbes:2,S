Network Appliance filers (which are, to my mind, the ultimate external
RAID device 8^) do this, but of course they store such transactions
in NVRAM.  LLike Stephen said, the OS can assume that the disk will do
the right thing, because disks do do the right thing in this regard.
He knows of which he speaks.
