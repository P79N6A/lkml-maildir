Driver calls request_firmware in the resume method. The userspace helper 
can't be run because it's been frozen, so the firmware never gets loaded 
and the call times out. The driver then fails to resume. While all this 
is happening, the rest of the kernel is blocking on that resume method. 
The firmware can be loaded once userspace has been started again, but by 
that time the driver has given up.
