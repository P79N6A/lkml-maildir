Sorry about the delayed response. We can use HPET in 64 bit mode
with 64 bit kernel. But, doing so with 32 bit kernel will be a
problem. That is one of the main reasons why we always just used
32 bit counters.
Specifically this in the patch
>+       do {
>+               high = hpet_readl(HPET_COUNTER + 4);
>+               low   = hpet_readl(HPET_COUNTER);
>+               high2 = hpet_readl(HPET_COUNTER + 4);
>+       } while (high2 != high);
A single read of HPET is expensive (off the order of 2000 cycles).
3 reads like this multiplies it by 3 and that happens in a
common code path of hpet_next_event().
Compared to that with emulating the 2 or 3 other HPET timers to
be 64 bit using 32 bit base. That will cause 2 or 3 extra interrupts
for every 4 mins (overflow). That may be much lower overhead. There
May be accuracy issues that we have to deal in emulating. But,
still 3 hpet reads in place of 1, in common path, will be the deal killer.
