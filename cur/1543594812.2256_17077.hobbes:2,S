There is a huge academic research literature on how to prove that a large
set of threads will all meet deadlines in a realtime system.  Years ago I
made a not-so-brilliant optimization to RTLinux scheduler that had an unanticipated
side effect of only scheduling the first two threads created. Nobody noticed
for months, because RT programmers know that more than 2 threads is 
almost always a design error.  Not always though.
(now we have regression tests so I could not make such an experiment again).
