hdparm -t is a perfect example of a synthetic benchmark.  NCQ was 
designed to optimize real-world workloads.  The overhead gets hidden 
pretty well when there are multiple requests in flight simultaneously, 
as tends to be the case when you have a user thread reading data while a 
kernel thread is asynchronously flushing the user thread's buffered 
writes.  Given that you're breaking even with one user thread and one 
kernel thread doing I/O, you'll probably get performance improvements 
with higher thread counts.
