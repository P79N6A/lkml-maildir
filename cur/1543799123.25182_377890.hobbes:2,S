Yes!
The locking code of the pi locks in the rt.c code is VERY dependent on
the order of locks taken.  It works by assuming the order of locks taken
will not themselves cause a deadlock.  I just recently submitted a patch
to Ingo because I found that mutex_trylock can cause a deadlock, since
it is not bound to the order of locks.
So, to answer your question more formal this time.  If the futex code
uses the pi_lock code in rt.c and the futex causes a deadlock, then the
kernel can deadlock too.
The benefit of this locking order is that we got rid of the global
pi_lock, and that was worth the problems you face today.
