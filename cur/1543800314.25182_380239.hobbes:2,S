I already switched nvidia for the nv driver in the kernel. Also disabled
by unloading all modules.
You're saying i should then see what happens after doing the above ...
This is exactly what i'm now doing, tvcard is active (tv) and i'm doing
some work as usual. I get the feeling some people consider everyone who
is a bit different in approach as either some newbie or an idiot, well
wake up, sometimes by looking from a different view at a problem it can
be solved. This doesn't mean i don't appreciate the advise of Lee or
yours, i only ask for some patience. It's not like the world is going
under if we don't solve this in an hour with traditional logic. :)
And at this point the system is still working, i'm increasing the load
by making it crush numbers, doing a full virusscan and so on.
