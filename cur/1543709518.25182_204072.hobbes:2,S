that's a nice theory with the benchmarks that runs with a 64G working
set, but if your working set is smaller than 32G  99% of the time and
you install the 64G to handle the peak load happening 1% of the time
faster, you'll run 30% slower 99% of the time even if the benchmark
only stressing the 64G working set runs a lot faster than with 32G only.
