True, but precisely, I wonder what will perform the best in practice, a
single semaphore that is unconditionally taken by ACPI/AML, or your
finer-grained approach and its many additional tests.

Good point.

The problem is that the rarity of ACPI foreign port access doesn't
matter much, as you have to do all the tests first to find out that it
was a foreign port, and I suspect that these tests will cost more than
taking the lock itself.

True, this is the problem with having a single mutex: everything gets
serialized. I have no idea how often we are running AML code though, so
I don't know if this is a real problem in practice.
We may be able to workaround the inter-driver exclusion though, if we
use a semaphore initialized to N, have ACPI take N, but other drivers
take just one. This would let ACPI be exclusive with all the other
drivers, but drivers themselves could otherwise run concurrently. That
being said, we do not appear to have the required primitives to take
more than 1 semaphore resource at once at the moment, so we'd need to
do that first.
OTOH, I certainly hope that not that many drivers are affected on a
given system, so maybe serialization is acceptable. We'll need some
field experimentation to find out.

Yep, that's a bit complex, but should work, thanks for sketching this.
