Hi all,
A friend of mine has given an old HP D2045A tape (120 MB) to me (and 12
virgin tapes :-) The drive is made by Irwin and reading the ftape HOWTO 
I suspect it's not compatible with QIC-80 standard. Of course, I have
tried ftape (kernel 2.2.14) with this beast with no luck. Should I throw
the streamer to the bin basket?
Thanks in advance
PS: I have sent this e-mail to the linux-tape list too so my apologies if
you recieve it twice.
