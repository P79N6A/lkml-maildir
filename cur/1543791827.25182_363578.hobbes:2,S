Well, apparently the plan is to eventually bundle it with the kernel if
not mistaken.  Also, it have seen a stable release, and it works well
for what it was intended for, and still have a less footprint than
uClibc if space is really an issue.

It does work, just need to be fixed up for ARCH=um compiled kernel.  I
did a quick hack to do this, but HPA don't like it (and I do not blame
him).  Can be found here:
