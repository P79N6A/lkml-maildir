Lockup is certainly not the expected behavior.

For one, that's an awfully old kernel that you are running and secondly if you
have support, only SuSE is going to be able to help you with this problem since
it's not a stock kernel.org kernel but a SuSE one. 
Alternatively, you could run the latest stable kernel (
http://kernel.org
) and
try to reproduce the problem.
Hope that helps.
