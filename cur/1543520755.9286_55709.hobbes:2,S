Please Cc: me <mash@mashke.org> as I'm not subscribed -- I'm afraid this
is my last resort, with RTFM, reading archives, and 3 days of trying
yielding nothing...
System: 2.2.13 installed on top of RH 6.1/Intel, Mitsumi CR-4802TE ATAPI
CD-RW as master and Toshiba CD-ROM as slave on secondary IDE. With no SCSI
emulation, the messages go like this:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 21
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
hda: WDC AC310100B, ATA DISK drive
hdc: CR-4802TE, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdd: TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-6502B, ATAPI CDROM drive
and everything mounts and reads, so I presume the CD-RW itself is OK. But
now I want to make that CD-RW into something more than a CDROM :-)
Going the way suggested in cdrecord's README.ATAPI (disabling IDE CDROM
support altogether and putting in SCSI emulation plus SCSI support) leads
to kernel refusing to boot ("Ran out of input data").
So I go the way of the CD-Recording-HOWTO:
.config -->
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=m
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDETAPE is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEFLOPPY is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI=m
<...>
CONFIG_SCSI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=m
# CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR_VENDOR=y
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG=m
# CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN is not set
/etc/lilo.conf -->
append="hdc=noprobe hdc=ide-scsi hdd=ide-cd"
/etc/conf.modules -->
alias scd0 sr_mod
alias scsi_hostadapter ide-scsi
options ide-cd ignore=hdc
What happens is that the "hdc: ..." kernel message mentioned above 
vanishes, BUT:
scsi : 0 hosts.
scsi : detected total.
and then
root[1002]:~# cdrecord -scanbus
Cdrecord release 1.8a36 Copyright (C) 1995-1999 JЖrg Schilling
cdrecord: No such file or directory. Cannot open SCSI driver.
Compiling anything from the SCSI section into the kernel rather than
modules doesn't help either. Also, taking ANY of the mentioned things out
of lilo.conf or conf.modules (e.g. dropping hdc=noprobe from lilo.conf or
commenting out the aliases in conf.modules) leads to the "hdc: ... "
message reappearing, i.e., the CD-RW being grabbed by ide-cd. Which is
also not the way the HOWTO, or the archives, indicate it should be.
Any suggestions, please?..
Thanks much,
                                                  Stefan
