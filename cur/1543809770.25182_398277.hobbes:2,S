For those who need to see the glibc side of the robust futex patch to
make up their minds, it is available for now at:
http://people.redhat.com/drepper/d-robust-list
It must be applied on top of the current cvs code and it's only
working on x86 and x86-64 so far (maybe SH).  There is one unfortunate
area in the patch which makes it look ugly (the list handling on
64-bit systems, due to the layout requirements and the kernel list
walking) but the rest is easy and clean.
