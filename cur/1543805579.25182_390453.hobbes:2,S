The exception here demolishes this argument, IMO. Moreover, if the 
unlocker was a lower priority thread and there are higher priority 
threads blocked on the mutex, you really want the higher priority thread 
to run.

The time at which the decision takes effect is immaterial; the point is 
that the decision can only be made from the set of options available at 
time T.
Per your analogy, if a new bid comes in at time T+1, it can't have any 
effect on which of the bids shall be accepted.

I am not debating what the policy can decide. Merely the set of choices 
from which it may decide.
