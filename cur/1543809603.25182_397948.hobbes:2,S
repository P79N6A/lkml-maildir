That's fine, you do not have to be a i2c driver to use the hwmon
interface.  There are other drivers in the drivers/hwmon/ directory
today that are not i2c drivers.  It is not a requirement at all.

No.  Use the same names for your files as is described in the document.
If you can't provide all of the different files, that's fine, just
provide what you can.  The userspace tools will handle this properly.
This also keeps you from having to write custom userspace tools for
every individual program that wants to know this information.
