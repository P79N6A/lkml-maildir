Hi Dave, I have an amd64 box for which every kernel
after 2.6.18 hangs during boot, so I have no dmesg :(
I used git bisect to find out where the problem patch is,
and assuming bisect works (imho it jumped between versions
very weirdly: closing in on the last 6 revisions, it
jumped from 2.6.18 to 2.6.18-rc2 to 2.6.18-rc6), the problem
is a patch in intel-agp.c, where support for the intel 965G
is added (which I have).
I mailed the author of the patch, including the git Id
of that patch... but he didn't reply... and I didn't keep the
mail :/ So, I am afraid I can't give much details.
I'd still like to have it sorted out. If you give me the
green light (in the sense that you are willing to help
a kernel-newbie when needed) then I'll have another
attempt at getting more information.

PS I believe it was you who committed the patch.
