I know this has the potential of being an unfortunate situation for
many, but edicts do not help.
If neither LVM2 or EVMS are truly ready, no one is beholden to anyone
else as to anything's inclusion in mainline.
It's a matter of marketing so say whether Linux has volume management.
If all the distros have LVM in some form, then "Linux has an LVM". So,
no one can really say "Linux doesn't have an LVM so it's not enterprise
ready.
It's just really inconvenient for those who
 1. want to run a devel kernel
 2. want to run an LVM
 3. want to be really really up-to-date
because we (the testers) have to do a lot of the forward porting grunt
work fixing all the patch rejects and compile errors that inevitably
come.
