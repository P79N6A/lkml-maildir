There's no point in expending effort on a fancy new lock until this option
has been eliminated, so yeah, things are stuck.

Yes, that needs evaluation.  If it's a problem then we might need to
introduce a more sophisticated user interface which enables userspace to
take multiple CPUs online and offline in a single step, rather than
one-at-a-time.  I expect that'd be fairly straightforward.
