FWIW (which may be little) the ieee1394 code in 2.5.51 simply does not
work and the svn tree (same code as in 2.5.52) does.  For those of us
who depend on sbp2 for day-to-day functionality it makes current 2.5
possible....
That said, less divergence between Linus' bk tree and linux1394.org's
svn tree would be welcome.
