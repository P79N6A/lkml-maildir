Argh - minor detail, but this is the first (outside of fs/proc/base.c)
"#ifdef CONFIG_CPUSETS" in a kernel *.c file.  I prefer to avoid that.
How about doing this as I suggested in my previous message, like the
other cpuset hooks, with a cpuset_* macro in include/linux/cpuset.h?
This macro would either be the 'nodes_and(...)' code if CPUSETS are
configured, else a no-op.  Say something like ...
	cpuset_restrict_to_current_mems_allowed(nodes);
