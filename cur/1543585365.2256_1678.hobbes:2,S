Yes, I think you are right.

irq=none should definitely be honoured, or else the user has to reboot
in order to debug problems with printing.  The user's io=, irq= and
dma= settings should always be honoured. IMHO.
When irq=auto, the BIOS settings should be used.
Case in point: until very recently there was a bad problem in the
irq-driven printing path.  But only people with Via chipsets were
reporting it, and it didn't go away with 'irq=none' (which parport.txt
says to do in order to trouble-shoot).  It makes Via chipsets the
exception, and it's confusing IMHO (it confused me, anyhow).
