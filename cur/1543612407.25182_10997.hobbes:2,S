   You tell me - which is easier, multithreading the networking stack to 
   64 way SMP or running 64 distinct networking stacks?
We've done %90 of the "other stuff" already, why waste the work?
We've done the networking, we've done the scheduler, and the
networking/block drivers are there too.
I was actually pretty happy with how easy (relatively) the networking
was to thread nicely.
The point is, you have to make a captivating argument for ccClusters,
what does it buy us now that we've done a lot of the work you are
telling us it will save?
