Hi all,
I somehow finalized the article,
you can find it here:
http://technologynews.altervista.org/index.php?mod=read&id=1130758467
I'm looking for a better place where to put the article,
technologynews has formatting issue but you can easily read the
content even if the formatting is different from the plain text
version I wrote.
I sent the article to both osnews.com and slahdot.org but I dunno
whether they are willing to publish it.
I will redirect the technologynews link to the web site of my LUG as
soon as they'll provide me page in the article section.
I hope someone will find the article useful ;-)
