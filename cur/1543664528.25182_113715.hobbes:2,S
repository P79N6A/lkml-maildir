Hi Jaroslav, Hi everyone,
I have the following problem with Kernel 2.4.20 and the alsa 0.9.0_rc6 / rc7 drivers:
When I try to load the snd-intel8x0 driver I get the message that no such device is installed. But when I first load the kernel i810_audio driver and then unload it again, I can load the snd-intel8x0 without any problems....
This happened not with 2.4.19 and alsa < 0.9.0_rc6..
Another question:
Why can't I play more than one sources on the same time with such a card? All programs which would access /dev/dsp blocks until the other programs frees the device... It isn't very useful.
I have no such problems with multiple sources as example on my SBLive or on my yamaha sound card with the snd-ymfpci driver.
Do I miss some settings?
Thank you!
Marc
