Subject: static modules_{init,exit} functions in pre3-2

	linux-2.4.0test3-pre2 adds "-Werror" to the default C compiler
flags, which is forcing the elimination of lots of unused variables
and functions, which I think is great.  It also is causing compilations
of modules to abort if their module_{init,exit} functions are declared
static.  I guess that at least in the case of the initialization functions,
making them global will encourage people to use the same initialization
functions for the modular and non-modular cases, which will improve
maintainability.
	Anyhow, I am happy to submit patches to make these declarations
non-static as I come across them, but I would like to get confirmation
that this is the intention before I submit a bunch of unwanted patches
(an alternative, for example, would be to somehow redefine module_{init,exit}
to add a reference to the function that would appease gcc).
