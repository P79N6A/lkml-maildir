yeah, that's exactly the thinking. Distros basically set general policy, 
but a quirk is (almost) always specific and correct enough to override 
that. We could perhaps refine this by directing the quirk to only be 
applied if the current type is 0x80 - because in that case we know that 
it's definitely not going to work. I.e. something like the small patch 
below?
