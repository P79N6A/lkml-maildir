Well you don't - the first versions used the SMP spinlocks macros but
replaced them with own code. (basically an INC on entry and a DEC and test
when leaving)
Think about what happens on a UP
There are two cases
 - the processor is in the critical section, it can not be preempted = no
   other process can take the CPU away from it.
 - the processor is not in a critical section, no process can be executing
   inside it = can never be busy.
=> no real spinlocks needed on a UP
