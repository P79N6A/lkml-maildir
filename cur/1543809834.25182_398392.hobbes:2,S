This email lists some known regressions in 2.6.16-rc4 compared to 2.6.15.
If you find your name in the Cc header, you are either submitter of one 
of the bugs, maintainer of an affectected subsystem or driver, a patch 
of you was declared guilty for a breakage or I'm considering you in any 
other way possibly involved with one or more of these issues.

Status     : Dmitry: Working on various manifestations of this one.
                     At worst we will have to disable resync by default
                     before 2.6.16 final is out and continue in 2.6.17 cycle.
