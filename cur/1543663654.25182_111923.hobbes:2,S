Did you miss the TPC-C announcement from last November & December?
 rx5670 4-way Itanium 2: 80498 tpmC @ $5.30/transaction (Oracle 10 on Linux).
 rx5670 4-way Itanium 2: 87741 tpmC @ $5.03/transaction (MS SQL on Windows).
Both world-records for 4-way machines when they were announced (not
sure if that's still true).
