Huh, so IDE scsi emulation doesn't?  (Not that I use it.  I want SCSI _off_.)
Hmmm...  I just extracted a fresh tarball and tried again and had the same 
problem.  Possibly I'm looking in the wrong place?  "Device drivers"->"SCSI 
Devices", top of the menu the option is "---" instead of selectable.  Seems 
an odd place to put the SCSI bus, but I can't find it it any of the menus 
above that (and I just spent another 5 minutes looking).
It's too late in the development cycle to complain about the menu layout, but 
as soon as 2.7 opens...  (Okay, I'll get lost in the noise, but still...)

Don't worry, if I get really bored, I'll start sticking printfs into kconfig.  
In the mean time, I can pipe .config through "grep -v SCSI" for my own 
purposes...
