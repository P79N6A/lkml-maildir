Your patch seems to do two things:
First, it automatically falls back on using a socket's PCI interrupt
if its ISA interrupts are not available.  That part seems ok.
But, it also falls back on sharing an interrupt if a driver requested
an exclusive interrupt and that was not available.  This part is not
ok.  The original code will share a PCI interrupt automatically, but
will not share an ISA interrupt except under certain circumstances
(for multifunction cards or when the driver specifically requests it).
Sharing ISA interrupts is unsafe and should never be done blindly.
