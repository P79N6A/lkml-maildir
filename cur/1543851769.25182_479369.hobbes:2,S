Hi all,
it has been a very calm month with very few patches and no serious
security problem, hence the lack of an earlier pre-release. Eventhough
there are very few fixes, I thought it was worth tagging another
pre-release for all those how don't use GIT.
We're close to an RC. I've just installed the RAM I ordered to upgrade
my Alpha, on which I will try to bring in support for gcc 4 (when gcc4
finally decides to build). If I manage to do it easily, I will add
another pre-release with it, otherwise I may release rc1 without it.
In the mean time, version 2.4.33.4 will follow shortly with some of
the small fixes below. If anyone encounters any problem, please
report it now. Same if you have unsent fixes you would like to see
merged.
Cheers,
Willy
