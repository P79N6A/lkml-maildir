Nothing really amazing.. (I also miscounted -- 4 patches).
-rw-r--r--    1 davej    davej        4613 Dec 15 23:31 linux-2.6-build-nonintconfig.patch
Adds a 'nonintconfig' target that behaves like oldconfig, but doesn't
ask any questions (takes the default answer), and prints out a list
at the end of all the options it didn't know about.
(Handy when rebasing, as it means I get to add all the new options
 in one swoop).
-rw-r--r--    1 davej    davej         605 Dec 15 23:31 linux-2.6-build-reference-discarded-opd.patch
Think I posted this already, and it may even be in 16rc
-rw-r--r--    1 davej    davej        1686 Dec 15 23:31 linux-2.6-build-userspace-headers-warning.patch
adds a #error to includes if __KERNEL__ isn't being used
(We want people to use the headers from our glibc-kernheaders package,
 not from the kernel soucre).
-rw-r--r--    1 davej    davej        1753 Dec 15 23:31 linux-2.6-bzimage.patch
To get around some gynamstics in the rpm spec, defining a seperate build target
for every arch, we make every arch grok 'bzImage'. Fugly, but it keeps the
spec cleaner to maintain.
