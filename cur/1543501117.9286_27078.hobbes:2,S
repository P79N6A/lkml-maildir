Yeah, you are absolutely right.No doubt on what you have said. But, sorry,
either you didn't understand the idea or I couldn't make the proper statement
so that you can understand. Anyway what I was saying one way to use message
filter. Because if you look at any other mailing lists such as CAN, USB,
pSOS, NTDEV etc etc. they uses above mentioned words in their subject.
That's it.
bye
thanks for your advice
