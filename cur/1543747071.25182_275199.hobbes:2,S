A while back I suggested checking the last mount time of the mounted local 
filesystems as a quick and dirty sanity check between loading the image and 
unfreezing all the processes.  (Since a read-only mount shouldn't touch this, 
triggering swsusp resume from userspace after prodding various hardware 
shouldn't cause a major problem either...)  Does that sound like a good idea?
Haven't had time to look into it myself, though.  (Just recently got time 
enough to bang on busybox again.  Somewhere around 2.6.7, software suspend 
stopped working for me and I haven't even had a chance to track _that_ down 
yet.  Hopefully fixed in 2.6.9 or 2.6.10, I haven't played with it 
recently...)
