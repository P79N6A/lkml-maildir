OK, but here, 2 of these 3 reads are done after another one.
For example, does it change anything to add something like this :
do {
   volatile int slow;
   v1 = inl(pmtr_ioport);
   for (slow = 500; slow--;);
   v2 = inl(pmtr_ioport);
   for (slow = 500; slow--;);
   v3 = inl(pmtr_ioport);
} while ...
If it does not change anything, then it means that there is a recovery
time after a read, which would imply that the 3 back-to-back reads are
more harmful than it seems.

OK, thanks for the info, I didn't know about that.
