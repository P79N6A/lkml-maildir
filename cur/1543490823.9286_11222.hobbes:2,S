There's a potential problem under certain load conditions with 2.2.4,
which should be fixed by this one-liner. If you have trouble with 2.2.4
(apart from the obvious one where you have to add ", NULL" to two places
in kernel/acct.c), would you try this simple thing?
Note that I _really_ want to hear about if if this makes any difference
at all.  It's a real bug, but I think it needs some rather pathological
usage patterns to actually become a real problem.  So I'd like to know
if it actually makes a difference in real life...
