I kind of like the way the gtk and gnome packages have a script that
can be run to get CFLAGS.  You could have a kernel script that gets
generated and installed when you do a 'make install' or 
'make modules_install' which would spit out the correct CFLAGS for the
include files.  It could be as easy as:
	#!/bin/sh
	echo "-I/home/bapper/src/linux-2.4.0/include"
That way any Makefile can run the script on the command line for gcc:
	gcc -O2 `/lib/modules/kernel-includes` -c foo.c
It could take some arguments to echo other flags such as CFLAGS the
kernel uses to compile modules.  And of course, this would have the
added bonus of defining the architecture and optimizations that were
used in the compiling of the kernel.
