I have exactly the same problem with my IBM ThinkPad T43 and 2.6.14
kernel and still can't find a way to let ata_piix manage the hard drive
and generic_ide to manage the optical one. BIOS doesn't have any
settings for SATA on this notebook.

Sorry, but provided ata_piix has ignored the optical drive, couldn't
corresponding I/O resource be left free so that subsequently loaded,
say, generic-ide module is able to get over and support the drive?
BTW, loading the modules in reverse order helped on 2.6.13 kernel (that
I'm currently using) as generic-ide didn't recognize the hard-drive at
all allowing ata_piix to get over it later. With 2.6.14 kernel
generic-ide does recognize both hard-drive and optical drive thus
preventing ata_piix from managing the hard-drive :(
