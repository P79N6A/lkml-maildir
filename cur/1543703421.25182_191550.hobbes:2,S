Subject: ACPI broken on all 9 of my machines :(

While investigating an ACPI problem (see another thread) it occured to me that 
of the 7 different machines I have in my immediate workspace, none of them 
work properly with ACPI in latest 2.4 or 2.6 kernels. I have P3, dual P3, P4, 
dual HT Xeons, Opteron and VIA Samuel based motherboards, Thinkpads A21p and 
A31p, and none of them work properly with ACPI. 100% failure.
Am I just unlucky? Or is this the general experience?
I have indeed bugzilled some of the problems, but will do a complete fresh set 
of tests on all the different types of machines, and present the results 
here.
