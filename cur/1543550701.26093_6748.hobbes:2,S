Hi,
I started a compile of kernel test9-final on a virtual console.
(make bzImage modules modules_install)
Then I started X on another one. Initial windows showed up fine.
But mouse was stuck. Tried magic - nothing. (early in compile,
should not be at modules_install for a long time)
I noticed that disk led flashed now and then - decided to wait.
After a while the xlock (really the kde one) started - did not
react on keys (I had pressed magic-r earlier).
Left it over night.
Still no reaction to keyboard and mouse - RESET.
Conclusion:
- Probably not vm related since compilation probably continued
  in the background.
