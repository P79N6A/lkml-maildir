The i386 is older than some of the kernel hackers, and given that a
modern kernel is pretty painful with less than say 16MB or RAM in
practice, I don't see that it would be all that terrible to drop
support for ancient CPUs at some point (yes, I know some newer
embedded (and similar) CPUs might be affected here too, but surely not
that many that people really use --- and they could just use 2.4.x).
