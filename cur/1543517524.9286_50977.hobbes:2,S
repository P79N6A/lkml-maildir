ioremap_nocache(). You can also use ioremap_nocache() on allocated pages
(it's a page granularity thing) via doing something like:
	page = __get_free_pages(whatever, order);
	ptr = ioremap_nocache(virt_to_phys(page), 1 <<
			(order+PAGE_SHIFT));
then use 'ptr' as an uncached alias to your pages. You cannot do the above
in interrupts (obviously), and it's not fast so probably it's worth being
done once, at initization time.
for this to work you also have to modify arch/i386/mm/ioremap.c and
remove the following lines:
        /*
         * Don't allow anybody to remap normal RAM that we're using..
         */
        if (phys_addr < virt_to_phys(high_memory))
                return NULL;
and remove:
        if (addr > high_memory)
from the iounmap() function.
or better, create a new interface (memremap_nocache()) which only remaps
normal RAM pages.
