Ok, I guess I'm lost. If I offline second CPU, I immediately get
1000Hz timer tick... is that expected?
I'm trying to decide when system is idle (lets say that means "no user
task is scheduled to wakeup within 10 seconds)... I added some
instrumentation to nohz subsystem, but it does not behave like I'd
expect: even if I run "while true; do sleep .01; done" loop, I see
nohz preparing for 5 seconds sleep... while it seems obvious that it
can only be 10msec sleep, and with max_cstate=1, it works that
way... Plus, nte->start_pid seems to contain some random numbers :-(.
What am I doing wrong?
(Patch for illustration, I can generate full diff against vanilla,
but...)
