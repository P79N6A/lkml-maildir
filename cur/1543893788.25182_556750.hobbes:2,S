If it would be enough to have a backup (with meta-data), that needs some 
software to be read again, you could also try fsvs (
http://fsvs.tigris.org
).
That does a full filesystem versioning (with owner, group, mode and mtime) 
into a subversion repository. This would have the benefit that you could keep 
the "prefered" filesystem, but have a (versioned!) backup of your data.
The files can, if fsvs is not available, be restored by subversion binaries 
(although without meta-data support), so in case of an emergency you could 
read the data even from windows. (Like when using tar, you'd need to download 
something or keep this binary on the usb-stick).
http://freshmeat.net/projects/fsvs
:
  FSVS stands for "Fast System VerSioning", "File System VerSioning", or "Full
  System VerSioning". It is used for backup/restore and system configuration
  management, using a Subversion repository as the backend.
For questions "users" or "dev" "at fsvs.tigris.org" are available.
Regards,
Phil
