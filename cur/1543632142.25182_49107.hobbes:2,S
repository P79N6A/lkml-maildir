Linus,
is there any particular reason why you have not yet updated to my
lk-changelog.pl script or ever replied to any of my mails on that
subject?
I am constantly updating it to have it resolve most addresses to names,
fixing bugs, and it seems people are all in favor of my script, but
still it looks as though some very early version was used to generate
this summary which knows hardly half of the common mail addresses.
I'm not adding the script again, it has been posted less than 24 hours
ago (in response to Marcelo's 2.4.19-pre9 announcement), if you need it,
find it at 
http://mandree.home.pages.de/linux/kernel/
 or drop me a line
-- the current version is v0.21.
Thanks for your attention.
Matthias
