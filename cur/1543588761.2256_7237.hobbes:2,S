Please don't add more of those horrible "wait" arguments.
Make two different versions of a function instead. It's going to clean up
and simplify the code, and there really isn't any reason to do what you're
doing.
You should split up the logic differently: if you want to wait for the
page, then DO so:
	page = lookup_swap_cache(..);
	if (page) {
		wait_for_swap_cache:valid(page);
		.. use page ..
	}
Note how much more readable and UNDERSTANDABLE the above is, compared to
	page = lookup_swap_cache(..., 1);
	if (page) {
		...
and note also how splitting up the waiting will
 - simplify the swap cache lookup function, making it faster for people
   who do _NOT_ want to wait.
 - make it easier to statically check the correctness of programs by just
   eye-balling them ("Hey, he's calling 'wait' with the spinlock held").
 - more easily moving the wait around, allowing for more concurrency.
Basically, I don't want to mix synchronous and asynchronous
interfaces. Everything should be asynchronous by default, and waiting
should be explicit.
