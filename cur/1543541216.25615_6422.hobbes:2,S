First a quick question:  Is there a (sane) method to forcefully rmmod
a module with a count > 0?  It's getting tiresome having to reboot just
so I can change a module's configuration.
My problems are with lp.o, st.o and sym53c8xx.o with:
Linux-2.4.0-test5  (with UP XT-APIC configured in)
Modutils-2.3.13
Glibc-2.1.3
gcc-2.95.2
Snapshot of 'lsmod' with notes:
Module                  Size  Used by
lp                      4680   0 (autoclean)
lp Increments/Decrements fine until a print job fails.  This is
_always_ if I allow parport_pc to use DMA/IRQ.  After that it Increments
by 2 while printing and Decrements by 1 when finished causing the
count to continually increase and making the module unloadable.  I'm
trying to figure out why DMA/IRQ fails on my Inkjet but works with a
dot-matrix printer.
sym53c8xx              60528   0
Shouldn't the count on this    ^ be 1 since 'st' is loaded above it???
It does Increment/Decrement properly when in use.
st                     24536   1
st always Increments by 2/Decrements by 1 and as such becomes unloadable.
On this issue I don't fret too badly because I never need to rmmod the
module.
scsi_mod               82408   2 [sym53c8xx st]
via82cxxx_audio        10976   2
ac97_codec              7140   0 [via82cxxx_audio]
soundcore               3716   4 [via82cxxx_audio]
parport_pc             18812   1 (autoclean)
parport                26944   1 [lp parport_pc]
ne                      7324   1
8390                    6136   0 [ne]
isa-pnp                27820   0 [ne]
nls_iso8859-1           2860   1 (autoclean)
nls_cp437               4372   1 (autoclean)
msdos                   5292   1 (autoclean)
fat                    30880   0 (autoclean) [msdos]
Perhaps this should be added to the TODO but non-showstopper on the 
2.4.0 status page?
