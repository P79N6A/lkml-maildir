OpenFirmware is very similar to ACPI, except OpenFirmware interprets the
FORTH programs in the firmware itself, whereas ACPI does it in the OS.  
The
reason for the difference is that on Intel/x86 there is no compatible 
way to
call directly into the firmware from 32-bit code.  You won't find the 
two
on the same system, and they basically provide the same services: device
tree, power management, etc.
