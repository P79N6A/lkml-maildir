Point taken, this function is probably too big to be in header.

I'd still like this function to return suitable state (and do nothing
else), to make converting drivers easier.
For now suspend() only gets 0 or 3; I'd rather not change code for
now. Do we really enter PCI_D1 on standby? I believe PCI transitions
are fast enough to enter PCI_D3hot even for standby / suspend-to-ram.
