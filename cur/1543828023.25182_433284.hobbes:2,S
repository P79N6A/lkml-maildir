Again, just to be clear, I only hit the BUG_ON when using the -RT tree,
which is likely due to the fact that run_posix_cpu_timers() runs from a
kernel thread rather then interrupt context (thus tsk is not current and
you're more likely to race against an exiting task).
It may very well be the issue applies to mainline as well, but I just
want to make sure the proper caution is taken.

I will give them a go. Some of them are already in the -rt tree, as they
were triggered early on.
