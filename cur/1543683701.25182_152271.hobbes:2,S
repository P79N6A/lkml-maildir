First of all, Im sorry I started this. It was a genuine error on my side, to assume I stumbled on a bug, while it is in fact a hotly
debated 'feature'. I did google for it, but must have missed it, it would have saved my weekend. I didn't want to (re)start a
religious war.
Maybe we should let it rest for a bit, until we have something to discuss about. Right now, I've have the idea that people are
talking about slightly different things.

Me myself. I've downloaded it, and use it now. It works fine for me and I don't see any problems. But I do not oversee the whole
picture, and I don't think anybody fully understands the other camp's objections.
David, I hope that you will explain your side of the story, or maybe point to a webpage where it is explained clearly. I still have
no idea as to what your objections are, other than that in the past, another choice was made to do things.
Regards,
Bas
