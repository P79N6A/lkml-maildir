That isn't the question here. 
The current situation seems to be designed to add the new one and removing 
the old one as a single step. THAT IS BROKEN.
The new one and the old one needs to work at the same time, exactly so 
that there's a transition mechanism.
That's the part you seem to now have understood. There should be no "flag 
day" when people have to switch over.

You do not indeed see the point.
The point is, we can switch internal kernel ABI's - new or old - at any 
point. But user-level ABI's should never require a one-way update.

But we didn't have 6 months of the new API, did we? People complained. 
The person you merged through explicitly said that if he had realized what 
you did, he wouldn't have merged.
That should tell you something. Why are you ignoring this?
