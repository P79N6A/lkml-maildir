I never said it would be pretty. :)

Hmm, I wonder if the easiet way to do this at the moment would be
to add a platform specific hook that gets called during device_add().
On arches that don't need to do this, it would just be a nop, but on 
PPC64 and others it could do whatever is required.  By the time that 
device_add() is called, it is already attached to a bus, so this 
function could walk the tree to inherit parameters at discovery time 
instead of the above suggestion. 
Seems doable without impacting other arches.
