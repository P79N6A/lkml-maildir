It already exist, btw, but not exactly in that way - 
we have skb queue, which can not be filled from userspace 
if pressure is so strong so work queue can not be scheduled. 
It is of course different and is influenced by other things 
but it handles bursts quite well - it was tested on both 
SMP and UP machines with continuous flows of forks with
shape addon of new running tasks [both fith fork bomb and not],
so I think it can be called real bursty test.
