Hi Adam,
http://www.tecchannel.de/hardware/817/index.html
We do not put ATAPI devices on such HOSTS.
The driver will not work w/ ATAPI there because it uses a different DMA
engine location and is not supported in Linux.
You will find greater success in putting your ATAPI device on the native
south bridge.
Cheers,
