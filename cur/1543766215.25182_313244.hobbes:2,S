I guess there MIGHT be some command shell implementation
that stupidly _DID_ accept "#" as a comment character,
even immediately after an alphanumeric.
If that's true, then using # there would be a pain for portability.
But I think that's highly improbable.  A quick peek
at the Single Unix Specification as posted by the Open Group
seems to say that, according to the standards, that's NOT okay:

Basically, the command shell is supposed to tokenize, and "#"
only means comment if it's at the beginning of a token.
And as far as I can tell, it's not an issue in practice either.
I did a few quick tests on Fedora Core 3 and OpenBSD.
On Fedora Core 3, I can say that bash, ash & csh all do NOT
consider "#" as a comment start if an alpha precedes it.
The same is true for OpenBSD /bin/sh, /bin/csh, and /bin/rksh.
If such different shells do the same thing (this stuff isn't even
legal C-shell text!), it's likely others do too.
