Send patch. :-)
Anyway, treating ISDN4Linux and CAPI that differently is certainly
not appropriate, regardless of any xconfig bug, feature or other.

I don't know what you mean. The only menus I have to enter first
in order to deactivate them are the ones you left alone:
"Passive cards" (ISDN_DRV_HISAX), "Active cards" (no top-level
option), "Active AVM cards" (CAPI_AVM) and "Active Eicon DIVA
Server cards" (CAPI_EICON). There's no problem deactivating
ISDN_I4L or ISDN_CAPI (or both, should the fancy take me)
directly in the ISDN menu, neither in "make xconfig" nor in
"make menuconfig".
