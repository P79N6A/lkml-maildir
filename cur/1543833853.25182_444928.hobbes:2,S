You are not initializing x and y and with -Os at least my gcc really 
uses floating point load/store operations to handle that code.
Maybe the coprocessor has a hard time normalizing certain garbage on the 
stack, but without/with randomization the data comes from other 
addresses and you're just lucky with the contents.
Does this also happens if you add a "x=0, y=0;" line to that function?
