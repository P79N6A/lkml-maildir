The main motivation was to have the arch in control of as much direct
register writing as possible. Even though our HV does allow us to write
to config space, it's not obviously safe for Linux to be flipping bits
and also calling the HV to configure things. What's worse, I don't have
hardware that supports the mask bits, so I can't test it.
I also thought this would save me from having custom MSI irq_chips for
the powerpc backends. But I think I need them now anyway, so I guess
that's not a concern.
So I guess we'll drop this one, although I might try and tidy up the
implementation of "mask all MSIs" in msi_capability_init() as another
patch.
cheers
