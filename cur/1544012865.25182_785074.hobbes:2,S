The HECI interface would allow lm_sensors developers to grab the 
temperatures off the chips on the board.
From 2005(?)-2008 there was some chatter about supporting it but it never 
seemed to happen, is there any eventual planned support for supporting 
Intel's HECI interface or if the user wants to see the 
temperatures/voltages just buy a different motherboard with an ITE I/O 
controller?
I have a couple DG965WH boards and it would be nice to see the 
temperature of the chipset etc without having to reboot into the BIOS.
Justin.
