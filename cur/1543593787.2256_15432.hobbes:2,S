I hope you don't think people would assume that a "float" always
has useful data in all 23 fraction bits. It is a similar case.
So here you go, a kernel-safe conversion from C to K. It works
from 0 to 238 degrees C. Print as hex, so user code can toss it
into a union or maybe abuse scanf. Adjust as needed for F to K
or for hardware with greater resolution.
/* unsigned int degrees C --> float degrees K */
unsigned ic_to_fk(unsigned c){
  unsigned exponent;
  unsigned tmp;
  tmp = (c<<23) + 0x88933333; /* Kelvin shifted 23 left */
  exponent = 127; /* IEEE floating-point bias */
  while(tmp&0xff000000){
    tmp >>= 1;
    exponent++;
  }
  tmp &= 0x007fffff; /* keep only the fraction */
  tmp |= exponent<<23;
  return tmp;
}
