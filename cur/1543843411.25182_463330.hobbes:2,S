Would be interesting to see some measurements. But jumping is slower
than a simple branch (or noops to skip over that can be overwritten).

I'm fine with that ... "a fair chunk of people" - but it's not everyone,
by any means. We need both static and dynamic tracepoints, in one
infrastructure.

And what do those trace? I bet not half the stuff we want to do.
I've been migrating Google's tracepoints around between different
kernel versions, and it's not a mechanical port. Just stupid things
like renaming of functions inside memory reclaim creates pain, for
starters. (shrink_cache/shrink_list, refill_inactive_zone, etc).

an external patch is, indeed, pretty useless. Merging a few simple
tracepoints should not be a problem - see blktrace and schedstats,
for instance.

I wasn't saying that dynamic tracepoints are useless - I agree it's
valuable to add stuff on the fly. But some things are better done
statically.

I'll look again, but last time I looked it didn't do this, and
when I spoke to the kprobes/systemtap people at OLS, IIRC they
said it still couldn't.

If you have an extremely limited set of probes, on a static area
of the kernel, then yes, they may work for a long time. But try
tracing something like the scheduler, which people seem to delight
in rewriting every month or two ...
It amuses me that we're so opposed to external patches to the tree
(for perfectly understandable reasons), but we somehow think tracepoints
are magically different and should be maintained out of tree somehow.
You yourself made the argument that it's a maintainance burden to
keep the trace points *in* the tree ... if that's true, how is it
any easier to keep them outside of the tree?
If we really want to, we can still keep the hooks inside the code,
and have them do absolutely nothing at all - putting markers into
the symbol table is pretty much free. It also reuses the well
structured code-sharing mechanism we already have in place - the
linux kernel tree.
I really don't want to deal with all the systemtap crap - I just
want something that works, and I don't particularly care if I have
to recompile the kernel to get it. I know that doesn't suit everyone,
but there are requirements on both sides, and we should not dismiss
each other's requirements out of hand.
Having one consistent consistent collection mechanism for all these
different types of tracing data seems both logical and very important
to me ...
