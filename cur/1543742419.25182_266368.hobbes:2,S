Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of.  But as you wanted it to do
three different things... Hm, no, I guess you only wanted it to do 2
things.  Ah, that's not bad at all.  Been traveling too long, can't
remember threads...

I agree.  Hm, I guess the remaining 2 patches aren't that far away from
what I was thinking about originally. 
Ok, care to redo the "driver" patch to be a symlink instead?  I think
the last patch doesn't really need any changes, does it?
Hm, but how does this play with the current pci "add a new device id"
scheme?  Can this "bind_mode" scheme work with that?
