... that's true, and furthermore it allows the attack vector of
`compromise global state, then allow this process to die and allow
the global compromise to take over the box'.
Possibly for UML images you can core dump the entire UML for later

compromised guest can't affect any other guests or the hypervisor (which
we know to be untrue in the case of at least *one[ guest).
