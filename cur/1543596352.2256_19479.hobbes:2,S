It's likely hardware problems.  Different OSes excercise the memory subsystems
quite differently, so it's possible (and common) to see problems in one OS
where another appears to run fine.
Download memtest86 and test your system with 256MB in it -- if it reports any
problems, it's definitely hardware.
