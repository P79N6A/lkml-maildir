Two things here:
- tcpdumps on ppp0 will show unclamped packets since they haven't
been forwarded yet
- assuming you have ethernet internally, the PMTU from your router
to the internal hosts is 1500, so it won't do any clamping.
Does that explain it?
A useful thing for TCPMSS for routers would be to clamp to the
minimum of the PMTU of both directions. But thats not supported
so far.
