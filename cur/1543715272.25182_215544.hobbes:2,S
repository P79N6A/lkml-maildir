Hi Andrew,
I was just wondering, what would make sense..
Lets say I have a "goal" for allocation, but the goal is not inside my 
reservation window. Is it worth *try* to satisfy the goal by throwing
out our window ? Or should we ignore goal and allocate from the
current reservation window ?
And also, how does ext3 determines the goal ?
I am worried about a case, where multiple threads writing to 
different parts of same file - there by each thread thrashing 
reservation window (since each one has its own goal).
BTW, the current reservation code honors "goal" and throws our
window and tries to get a new one to satisfy the goal.
Thanks,
Badari
