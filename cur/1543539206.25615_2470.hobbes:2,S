Adding
     .PHONY: $(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h
to Rules.make seems to eliminate the race with minimal disruption.  This
forces modversions.h to be remade without checking modification times.
As things stand now, anytime one new .ver file is added, it remakes the
whole modversions.h from all the .ver files, so it isn't really any less
efficient.
