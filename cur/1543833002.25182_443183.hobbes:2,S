One more thing on this subject... "modulo that kernel header mess" is 
just as much a reflection of the fact that the Linux ABI really isn't 
particularly stable.  glibc contains a huge amount of code to deal with 
different kernel versions.  klibc will not be doing this; in general old 
klibcs should continue to work (but may not compile against a newer 
kernel), but a newer klibc may not work on an older kernel.
