Ok. Say we're might have an additional user space task which is not
frozen (say A).

Is the following scenario possible? 
FREEZE_KERNEL_THREADS: 
1) Mark all leftover threads as freezeable. That would include 'A'.
2) 'A' is now daemonised and we clear TIF_FREEZE in exit_mm().
3) 'A' calls try_to_freeze() but doesn't enter the refrigerator.
Hmm, on second thought, this shouldn't matter .
The subsequent iteration will set A's TIF_FREEZE flag anyway, right? 
So I think it should be ok to unconditionally clear the TIF_FREEZE flag
in exit_mm() after tsk->mm = NULL.
