True;
00:0e.0 Communication controller: NetMos Technology 222N-2 I/O Card (2S+1P) (rev 01)
PCI parallel port detected: 9710:9835, I/O at 0xb000(0xa800)
parport0: PC-style at 0xb000 (0xa800) [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
ttyS04 at port 0xb800 (irq = 5) is a 16550A
ttyS05 at port 0xb400 (irq = 5) is a 16550A
I'm running this with shared parport IRQs since i have another PCI device 
sharing that IRQ too (its a real mess)
I have been using this setup for a while now.
