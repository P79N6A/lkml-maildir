Maybe it'll unnecessarily complicate the thing, but since you repeat
the need to know the object - sometimes the locking is done to
synchronize something in time only, so to assure only one action is
done at a time or a few actions are done in proper order, or/and
shouldn't be broken in the meantime by other actions (so, no need
to deal with any common data).
But, of course, we can say an action could be a kind of object too.
