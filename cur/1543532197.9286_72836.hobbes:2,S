Yeah, I understand where you're coming from. But the current behaviour
isn't really causing a problem (there is a config option and boot
option), and there *were* good reasons to do it the way I did. Like I
said, I'd have to dig into my archives (and they are *big*) to extract
all the reasons. It wasn't just one.
I haven't had time today to respond further to this thread, but just
consider this point. If you boot with "devfs=only", then you *have* to
mount devfs before init/main:init() opens /dev/console. And booting
with "devfs=only" is legitimate.
