Rather use something else, like CAP_SYS_NICE.  It ties in with the idea
of scheduling, and doesn't further abuse the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.
CAP_SYS_ADMIN, while it has a good name, has become the catch-all of
capabilities, and if you have it, it is nearly the keys to the kingdom,
just like root.
Cheers, Andreas
