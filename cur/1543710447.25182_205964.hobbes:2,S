This is assuming we keep current design.

True, good catch.

Good.  Both variants of my mess worked, so I left it for the moment.

Not useful?  Without inheritance, I have to manually add the flag for
every file/directory I add.  Each time I forget, writes go to both
files and I notice the mess weeks later.  Naa, that's where we're now
and why I created the patch in the first place.
What we do need, though, is a new errno.  -EMLINK is close, but still
wrong.

No clue, don't care. :)

Not the only lock I missed.  Good.
