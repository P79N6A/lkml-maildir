Subject: 2.3.36 (also 2.3.35) has problems with zlib

I've noticed that there are two versions (at least) of zlib in the kernel 
v2.3.36 (also in v2.3.35)
one is in:
	drivers/net/zlib.c
and the other is in:
	fs/cramfs/inflate/*.c 
All the zlib functions are exported (not static), so the problem comes when
you compile the kernel with the cramfs support and net support.
Perhaps one solutions is to have one zlib, perhaps in lib (with lib/inflate.c?)
Any opinion ?
riq.
