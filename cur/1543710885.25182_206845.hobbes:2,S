I tried on my server that wasn't booting 2.6.4-mm1.
It is much happier.
I noticed that rc1-mm1 causes 4KSTACKS to be forced =y, where as in
2.6.4-mm1, it defaulted to =n.
So I retested 2.6.4-mm1 with 4KSTACKS=y and it still fails.
So: 2.6.5-rc1-mm1 seems to have fixed the problem I was having.
Thanks,
