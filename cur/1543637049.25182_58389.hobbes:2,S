While trying to boot 2.5.27-rmap-slablru, I got this early in the boot:
Kernel panic: Failed to create pte-chain mempool!
In idle task - not syncing
No other information was available.
I had previously booted and run 2.5.27 and 2.5.27-rmap.  I had to unset
CONFIG_QUOTA to get 2.5.27-rmap-slablru to compile.
I first applied the 2.5.27-rmap-1-rmap13b patch for 2.5.27-rmap, and
then applied the 2.5.27-rmap-2-slablru patch for 2.5.27-rmap-slablru.
The test machine is a dual p3 valinux 2231. Some options from .config:
[steven@spc9 linux-2.5.27-ck]$ grep HIGH .config
# CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM is not set
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is not set
# CONFIG_HIGHPTE is not set
CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y
