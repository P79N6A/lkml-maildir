OK. I assumed that Config.in was the authoritative source, and Config.help 
should match. Looks like (based on the Makefile) that I probably should have 
changed it to be CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1 in the Config.in. In fact, that 
driver won't ever be built with vanilla 2.5.25, with or without the previous 
patch
BK already has the previous change applied, so this in an incremental diff:
<bk text>
EMU10K1 build fix
Revert the CONFIG_INPUT_EMU10K1 change to drivers/input/gameport/Config.help, 
and change drivers/input/gameport/Config.in to use CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1

   The module will be called lightning.o. If you want to compile it as
   a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

   Say Y here if you have a SoundBlaster Live! or SoundBlaster
   Audigy card and want to use its gameport.
