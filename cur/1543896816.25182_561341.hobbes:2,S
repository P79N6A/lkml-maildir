Try to enable debugging then it may fail again despite your patch. You 
just scratched the surface with this and are enabling a dangerous usage 
mode with SLUB that we explicitly did not want to support anymore.

There could be other uses that were missed. I looked for slabs created by 
kmem_cache_create. The trouble is that any kmalloc could also be used for 
engineer these weird things (as seen here) and there are gazillions of 
kmallocs. That is why a VM_BUG_ON is useful. However, it requires some 
effort even with SLAB to create these things and--given that we have 
tested extensively on lots of arches--I am hopeful that 
we have caught everything.

SLUB used to implement the same special casing as SLAB did (which results 
in the fragile scenarios in which the above is possible). But we made the 
decision to clean up the slab interface and we dropped the emulation of 
the SLAB frills from SLUB.
Messy and problematic code like this should be removed. That improves the 
quality of the kernel. The removal is a straightfoward process. And the 
cases that we are discussing here are in remote corners of the kernel.
