I think you're misreading it.  This is the inner loop:
        for(i = 0; i < COUNT; i++) {
                asm volatile("push %%gs; mov %1, %%gs; addl $1, %%gs:%0; popl %%gs"
                             : "+m" (*offset): "r" (seg) : "memory");
                sync();
        }
        return "gs";
On entry, %gs will contain the normal usermode TLS selector.  "seg" is
another selector allocated with set_thread_area().  The asm pushes the
old %gs, loads the new one, uses a memory address via the new segment,
then restores the previous %gs.
So given this output:
"Genuine Intel(R) CPU           T2400  @ 1.83GHz" @1000Mhz (6,14,8):
ds=7b fs=0 gs=33 ldt=f gdt=3b CPUTIME 
[...]
The initial %fs and %gs are 0 and 0x33 respectively, and it is using
0x3b as the other GDT selector (and 0xf as the other LDT selector).
