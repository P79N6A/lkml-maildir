   Sure, but you use a 64bit read/store in set_bit/clear_bit etc., right? 
   If yes then you can't use this unless you rewrite them to use 32bit store
   - otherwise it will conflict with the atomic_t counter in the 64bit slot
   which is not protected.
It will be protected by the same spinlock, look at how the
thing works :-)
