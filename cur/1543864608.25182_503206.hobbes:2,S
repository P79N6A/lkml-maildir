Most of the useful IOMMU discussion happened at OLS anyway in the
various virtualisation talks.  I would expect that if there's a
virtualisation mini summit going on that these would again be discussed
there.
I suppose on a side note, in spite of the fact that the virtualisation
summit has identified IO as the major discussion area, no virtualisation
people actually signed up for the Filesystem and IO summit ...
