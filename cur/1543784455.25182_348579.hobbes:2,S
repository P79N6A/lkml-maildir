You must have mucked it up.

Nope.

pxm_to_node is *defined* in arch/x86_64/mm/srat.c, which is enabled by
CONFIG_ACPI_NUMA.
pxm_to_node is declared in include/asm-x86_64/numa.h
pxm_to_node is referenced in arch/i386/pci/acpi.c, under CONFIG_NUMA.
Consequently CONFIG_ACPI_NUMA=n, CONFIG_NUMA=y will fail to link.
Also x86 compilation of arch/i386/pci/acpi.c with CONFIG_NUMA=y will
generate an `implicit declaration of function' warning and will fail to
link.
Also, x86_64-srat-overlap-error.patch adds this forward decl in
arch/x86_64/mm/srat.c:
int node_to_pxm(int n);
Please, either give it static scope or, if it really needs global scope (it
doesn't), put the declaration in the right place?
