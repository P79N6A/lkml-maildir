If you guarantee this (and test for this) it's fine with me.  The POSIX
spec explicitly leaves this undefined and requiring to use mremap()
would be a nice way to work around this without allowing the
introduction of undefined behavior into programs.  I probably would
prefer to use mremap() since this makes it clear what should happen but
I can live with using the too-large mapping.
