As long as 2.2 is maintained, it's OK. You don't expect to get
new drivers for your network card for BSD 4.3 (tahoe) either do you.
Or do you upgrade those 4 year old systems to todays hardware
and expect to still be able to run a 2-3 year old kernel on them
that supports all modern hardware ?

You MUST be kidding. Most new drivers first appear in 2.2.XpreY,
then in 2.2.X, and only then in 2.3.Z. In fact that amazes me a
lot - I thought it would be the other way around.
One of Alans jobs for 2.4 is merging the 2.2.X fixes and drivers !
Mike.
