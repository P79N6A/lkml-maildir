Thanks a lot for finalizing that, Venki: looks good to me.
I didn't originally sign-off my version of your patch, but am happy
to do so now that you've gone over it again and fixed the pte_modify
issue (though I'm not sure what the order of our signoffs should be).
I shall need to cover the MAP_PRIVATE COW issue in do_wp_page,
but I think that's better done as a separate patch: I'll attend
to it in a few days, it's not something that will upset anyone
bisecting, my mind is elsewhere at present.
