I'm pondering now if having the i-pipe buildable as a module is still 
relevant, like it was during the early Adeos times. This was mainly used 
to reduce the compile-debug-reboot cycle, so that we could just unload 
the module for testing some non-critical Adeos features which were not 
related to the interrupt pipeline. This becomes clearly irrelevant in 
the i-pipe case (any bug in the i-pipe would very likely make the box go 
south anyway).
Additionally, dealing with a dynamically loadable i-pipe adds a small 
but permanent overhead for testing if the pipeline is enabled during 
internal operations.
Any objection to make the pipeline a static-only feature?
