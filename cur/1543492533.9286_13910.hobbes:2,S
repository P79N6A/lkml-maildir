You need a newer version of the tulip.c driver file, the one in the
kernels is too old. The one from
ftp://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/linux/drivers/test/tulip.c
 will probably
fix this for you. 
The tulip is a nice chip. Unfortunatly the vendors keep changing the exact
implementation all the time. :/
