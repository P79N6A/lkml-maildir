There is another reason to use ioctl(2): when you need to send data to
the kernel/driver and wait for a response. It supports transactions,
which read(2) and write(2) cannot. Therefore it remains useful.
Al, if you really want to kill ioctl(2), then perhaps you should
implement a transaction(2) syscall. Something like:
    int transaction (int fd, void *rbuf, size_t rlen,
		     void *wbuf, size_t wlen);
Of course, there wouldn't be any practical gain, since we already have
ioctl(2). Any gain would be aesthetic.
