I've made relatively minor changes to the glibc side since posting
the patch to the robust mutexes list.
- added EOWNERDEAD and ENOTRECOVERABLE to the glibc error reporting
  mechanism, so that strerror() works.
- added function prototypes to pthread.h for 
pthread_mutexattr_getrobust_np,
  pthread_mutexattr_setrobust_np, and pthread_mutex_consistent_np.
- defined a constant for accessing the pid that's stored in the futex.
- Changed copyrights from Bull SA (the French division of our company)
  to Bull HN (The U.S. division).
We expect to receive the FSF contracts for copyright assignment any
day now. If anyone would like to see the glibc changes, I can provide
the patch under the Bull HN copyright. The patch applies to glibc-2.3.4.
Todd.
