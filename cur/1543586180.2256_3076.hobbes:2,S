Probably.

No problem. That was just an example.

Exactly.

Exactly. With defaults filled in by the (some) driver.

I think it would make it more complicated. ioctl namespace is huge enough.
Without changing ifmap struct size (which would require recompilation
of all programs using it - ip, ifconfig etc), the *_protocol/physical
structures can only be 16 bytes long each (8 shorts or 4 ints) - I would
rather not put command code there.
Of course, the structs I outlined are just an example, which need
checking for max and min values and then setting variable length
(int/short/char).
