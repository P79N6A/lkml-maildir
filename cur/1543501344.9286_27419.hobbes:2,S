Subject: FS reorg in 2.3.x

I have noticed that as of 2.3.6, there has been a FS subsystem reorg
with some name changes. Aparrently these changes have been applied to
ext2, and probably the other major FS as well. However, these changes
have not been applied to the FAT system.
I have been trying to fix this, and have fixed it enough to make it
compile, but it does not link. The linker returns an error "undefined
reference to 'update_vm_cache'". My Q is "What is the function that has
replaced update_vm_cache()?"
Also, having replaced the call to generic_readpage w/
block_read_full_page, it will compile, but I get a warning
"initialization from incompatible pointer type". This is probably not a
bit problem, but I would wonder if it can be fixed. I use
pgcc-1.1.3(2.91.66).
BTW, I'm not on the list, so please cc any replies to me.
