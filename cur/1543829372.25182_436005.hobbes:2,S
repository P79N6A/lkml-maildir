Under what scenario could it possibly be legitimate to suspend a
usb device -- or interface, or anything else -- with its children
remaining active?  The ability to guarantee that could _never_ happen
was one of the fundamental motivations for the driver model ...
Maybe that invariant should be replaced with something else, though
I'm not sure what.  Certainly it would make a fair amount of sense
to leave unused PCI devices in the PCI_D3 state, for example; that
would be the PCI analogue of that invariant.
