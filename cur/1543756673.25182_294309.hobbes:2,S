Not in my experience.

Speculations aside, I have found only one sure way of breaking
the eternal kernel-hang if you make the mistake of inserting a bad
CD into your drive; Needlehole eject.
Sure, the kernel will spit loads of error messages at you, but atleast
it wont be hung anymore, you can save work and reboot.
For eternal hangs when burning CDs though, I've found the only
reliable way of unhanging the system is to unplug power to the 
CD burner and replug it. This seems to cause some amount of
disk corruption to the master device on the same IDE channel
though, so I guess if you have two harddrives, like me, it is a
hard choice between risking corruption on both, and risking
corruption on one.
