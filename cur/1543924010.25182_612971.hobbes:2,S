Really sounds good Christoph, not only for SLUB, so I guess the 32k limit is 
not enough because many things will use per_cpu if only per_cpu was reasonably 
fast (ie not so many dereferences)
I think this question already came in the past and Linus already answered it, 
but I again ask it. What about VM games with modern cpus (64 bits arches)
Say we reserve on x86_64 a really huge (2^32 bytes) area, and change VM layout 
so that each cpu maps its own per_cpu area on this area, so that the local 
per_cpu data sits in the same virtual address on each cpu. Then we dont need a 
segment prefix nor adding a 'per_cpu offset'. No need to write special asm 
functions to read/write/increment a per_cpu data and gcc could use normal 
rules for optimizations.
We only would need adding "per_cpu offset" to get data for a given cpu.
