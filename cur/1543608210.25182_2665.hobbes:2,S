sysctl IS NOT UGLY. Not the sysctl I know from Solaris or BSD. Both are
far more pleasant solutions then the proliferation of ad-hoc,
undocumented
ever changing, redunand, slow, overcomplex in implementation,
(insert a list of random invectives here) interfaces shown under /proc.
And yes I don't give a shit about "cool features" like:
echo "bull shit" >
/proc/this/is/some/random/peace/of/crappy/interface/design
BTW.> /proc/sys is indeed silly, since it's a "second order" interface
to something you can gat your gip on far easier already. And redundant
system
intrefaces are not a nice design.
