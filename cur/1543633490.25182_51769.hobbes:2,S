Gap, puke.  
Sorry I have built kernels where space was tight and I only built in
/proc so I could read /proc/net/dev.  And since with /proc everything
is all in one basket it is very hard to turn off unneeded features.
/proc might be nice to user space but as it is implemented it is
nasty to work with.
So a netdevfs or some solution that factors better would really
be nice.
