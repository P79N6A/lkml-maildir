	If you are OK with local compiles it can be trivially done via
CVS and skeleton Makefiles (think of *BSD ports). Since we have recursive
make anyway we could do download on demand from make. Actually I think
that it would be useful for normal setup too - s/download/ln(1)/. I'll
try to look at it - make definitely spends way too many time checking
dependencies. Smaller tree would make compiles faster.
	Server-side compiles... ;-/ Nah... gcc is waay too memory-thirsty
and several clients will suffocate any server. Unless you have a spare
Beowulf cluster to burn, that is.
