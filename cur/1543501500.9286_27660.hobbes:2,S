I guess that's impossible with today's PC BIOSes.  Perhaps you could go
back to real mode, call the host adaptor BIOS initialization by hand,
and then boot off the hard disk without a full reset, so that lilo has
a chance to create the dump.
OTOH, I like the current situation a lot. The Linux kernel is the only
large software project I know of which doesn't use classical debugging
tools, and Linus even said once he thinks that this has a positive
impact on the quality of bug fixes (i.e. only the person who fully
understands the bug can fix it, nothing like `oh dear, we have a null
pointer dereference here, so check for the null pointer and do nothing
in this case').
