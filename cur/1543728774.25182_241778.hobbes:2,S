Adrian, can you try the following patch?  This is very sketchy start
at using ACPI to enumerate floppies.  This patch only checks for
a floppy controller (PNP0700) in the ACPI namespace.  If ACPI has
been disabled, or we actually find a controller, we probe blindly
for the floppy controller as we did in the past.  If ACPI is enabled
and we DON'T find a controller, we just exit with -ENODEV.
A more ambitious patch would actually look at the _CRS of the
controller and use the IRQ and DMA information from there instead
of the current hard-coded defaults.  But that's a lot more invasive
and likely to break things.  And since floppies are nearly extinct,
I'm not sure there's enough benefit to justify that.
