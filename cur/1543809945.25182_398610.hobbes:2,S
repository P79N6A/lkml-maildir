Most likely it fails here:
		err = pci_write_config_dword(hw->pdev, PEX_UNC_ERR_STAT,
						 0xffffffffUL);
		if (err)
			goto pci_err;
PEX_UNC_ERR_STAT is 0x104; this register is outside of the standard
256-byte PCI configuration space, and is reachable only via the MMCONFIG
access mechanism.  Seems that kernel is not using MMCONFIG for some
reason; you mentioned that you have CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG=y in kernel
config, so it looks like your BIOS does not provide proper MCFG table.
Full dmesg output might give some clues.
