I had no idea this address existed, only when looking at my lkml-archive
i saw it posted this monday (!), prior to that I had not seen it and I
watch things quite closely.
How is anyone gonna try it out if it isn't announced and the proper
procedure of getting it going known? Randys recent kdump.txt update made
things alot clearer but it won't help finding the right source and
patches. Although personally I'd put up a complete tarball instead of a
patch so users/testers don't have to manually patch it up.
Also the latest kexec patches are at 
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/
nowdays and not with Randy. And there is even more confusion to it as there is:
kexec-tools-1.101.tar.gz
kexec-tools-1.99.tar.gz
I don't know about you but if I didn't know i'd definately go with the 1.99 one
even if 1.101 is the latest version.
