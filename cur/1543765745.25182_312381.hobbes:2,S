I had just a look at all those things... It simply was a question coming

Unable to mount root is an error message telling us that /dev/ram0 could
not be mounted as root (root=)...
Try to remove the root=/dev/ram0 line from your kernel command line. IMO
you don't need it, cause the kernel mounts initrd as root in any case.
One other reason for that could be that syslinux does not find and load
the initrd into memory, so the kernel does boot without it.

Not in special. I searched some things like that with remote booting
linux and *lots* of questions/checks comes into my mind when reading
your lines.

Thats not that big issue. Do you have a linux installation with grub as
bootloader (If you only have KNOPPIX/KANOTIX it would be more
difficult)? 
If, copy your kernel & initrd to /boot and edit grubs config file -
normally somewhere within /boot. /etc/grub.conf should be a symlink.
If not copy kernel/initrd to some directory (root would be best) on a
known harddisk. Boot some live linux that uses grub as loader. Goto
grubs command line (edit the configuration to boot) and use your kernel
and initrd to boot (you need to know the number of the harddisk from
which you boot: hd(hdd nummer, part. nummer) ). See grubs documentation
for details.
Is there a message that initrd was loaded to mem (from syslinux)?

find your mails much easier ;-))
