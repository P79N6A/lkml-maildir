DOH!  You're right.
I can now write to it, but only get one chance.  Copy a file to DVDRAM, read, print, etc, but when I try to rm or mv, segfault.  Foreverafter the DVDRAM is 'busy'.  Cannot umount.  Must reboot then umount.  Remount, get another write, but on subsequent write, segfault.
I am using UDF2. (UDF2.1 won't mount)  Would I be better off with UDF1.2, or FAT32?  How can I get details of the driver's capabilities?
