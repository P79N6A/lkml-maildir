I saw the same problem with the bcm-driver (Kernel 2.4.x) shipped with
SuSE 9 / SLES 8. Testcase was the initial mirror of a 10 GB partition on a
raid5 serveraid / XSeries 235 (2 way) to the same hardware on the remote
machine using both times the onboard NIC (Broadcom GBit Ethernet) via drbd:
100% CPU usage, 12 MB/s, machine is nearly death.
