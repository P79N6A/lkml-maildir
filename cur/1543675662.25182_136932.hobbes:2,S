Exactly. Only speaking for myself: I don't have access to the hardware,
the code is outside of the official tree and the maintainers don't
care if it ever gets merged. To me, that's not much different from all
the other obscure stuff in the vendor kernels.
Note that all the /important/ s390 drivers are in 2.5 (except qeth and
the new 3270 -- both are being worked on) and in reasonably good
shape now, mostly due to the fact that Martin rewrote 80% of the code
during the last year.
For zfcp, the chances of getting it cleaned up during 2.7 are good and 
the code for 2.6 will already be much better than what we have now.
For claw and z90crypt we still need a volunteer who will either take 
over maintainership or teach the current maintainers.
