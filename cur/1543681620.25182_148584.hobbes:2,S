With ACPI=off and state saving and powering the device down with 
pci_set_power_state on suspend, it is functional on resume but 
for the IRQ allocation. IRQ is set to 0 and card events work.
Getting on with ACPI then and expect this to take a while...
Others: pci=biosirq generates endless oopses/segfaults on boot
(no serial console to grab), perhaps someone else can reproduce this.
