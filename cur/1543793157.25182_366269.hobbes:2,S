The reason ARCH_HAS_READ_CURRENT_TIMER and related code was added is:
Due to SMIs happening during the calibration we were seeing calibration
returning
very low values with previous calibrate_delay() algorithm. With this low
value, 
we don't wait long enough during the timer initialization and we expect
some 
number of timer interrupts and we panic() when we don't see that many
interrupts.
All the above was with TSC based delay. 
I think we can keep calibrate_delay() do the calibration using
READ_CURRENT_TIMER 
(giving TSC per jiffy) and then convert it to some number of TSCs per
loop and 
use it in loop based delay.
Thanks,
Venki
