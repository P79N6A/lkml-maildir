Hi all,
yesterday I compiled a 2.6.15-rc2 on one of my Inspirons (NVIDIA GeForce2 Go)
with nvidiafb. I just changed the fb to some 1600x1200 mode and thus seems to
work (the source states GeForce2 Go is supported and known). However, the
letters seems to 'flicker' in some way. Uhm, it's not really flickering, it's
more like the sinle dots a letter is made of seem to randomly turn on an off. I
one takes a closer look it seems like the whole screen is 'fluent' or something.
Does anybody know how to handle that? I didn't specify a video mode, but
'video=vesafb:mtrr:3'. 
Regards,
	Marc
