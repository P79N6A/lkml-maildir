Sorry, I meant that we drop lock in skb_splice_bits() to prevent the deadlock,
and tcp_splice_read() needs it to process the backlog.
I think that even with non-blocking splice that release_sock/lock_sock
is needed, since we are able to do a parallel job: to receive new data
(scheduled by early release_sock backlog processing) in bh and to
process already received data via splice codepath.
Maybe in non-blocking splice mode this is not an issue though, but for
the blocking mode this allows to grab more skbs at once in skb_splice_bits.

Well, it maybe a good idea... Can not say anything against it :)
