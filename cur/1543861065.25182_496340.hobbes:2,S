I'm not sure I understood your problem correctly.
I see no reason to have two kernel versions on your host system. You can
keep 2.6.x on the host, and compile a 2.4.x for the target. You don't
need to run 2.4.x on your host.
The TS-Kernel the website talks about is meant to run on the embedded
target.
