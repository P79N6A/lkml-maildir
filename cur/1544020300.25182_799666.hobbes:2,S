what are the requirements for you to do this?
right now, the async calls are "fire and forget... but you can wait for
completion". The "price" is that the code needs to allocate a little
bit of memory for management overhead. The second price then is that 
if this allocation fails, the code needs to run "in context".
Would this be a problem?
I can add a variant of the API where you pass in some memory of your
own, which then does not fail. (but also won't get freed automatically
etc)
