   If you do the 
   work, you get to impact the license. If you don't, you had better SHUT THE 
   F*CK UP!
Note how I used the word "could" not "should" or "must".
Should I really SHUT THE F*CK UP as you suggest?
I totally agree with your position about who gets to decide
the license.  I thought the issue was one of usability, not personal
choice.
