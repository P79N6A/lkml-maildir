It's a _damn_ good point, but I see we went ahead and merged
sys_epoll_pwait without it anyway -- despite the fact that it's
include/linux/eventpoll.h which contains the example of why we should
think first :)
I think I even threw together an untested implementation of
compat_sys_epoll_pwait() at one point to assist with that task, but it
didn't seem to help much.
