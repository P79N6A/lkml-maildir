No trick other than to read what I said in either of the previous posts...
the question was not how to avoid having the useful feature, but how to
put it somewhere to avoid increasing the kernel size. I suggested in the
modules directory, either as a text file or as a module.
Disabling the feature is not the same as making it work optimally.
I like making it a module because it's obvious that modules_install is
needed. I see zero added utility from having it part of the kernel or
nothing, it's useful even to people booting from ROM, small /boot
partitions, etc.
