Subject: [patch 1/2] clk_must_disable() interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch adds a clk_must_disable() operation, exposing the clock constraints
which often distinguish system power states.  Systems with such constraints
include ones using ARM-based AT91, OMAP, and PXA chips.  The new operation
lets driver methods check those constraints.
(Note that because of its APM/ACPI legacy, Linux can't currently handle more
then two of those state through the /sys/power/state infrastructure; they
are called "standby" and suspend-to-"mem", regardless of what the underlying
hardware calls them.)
A common benefit to leaving some device clocks enabled is that a suspended
device may then be able to issue system wakeup events.  RS232, USB, Ethernet,
and other drivers can use driver model wakeup flags as userspace directions
about how to trade off between the lowest power "full off" driver states and
the more functional wakeup-enabled ones.

Seems appropriate for 2.6.22 merge ... last time this came up, there
were no real objections, but the sample implementation (AT91) was a
bit messy.
