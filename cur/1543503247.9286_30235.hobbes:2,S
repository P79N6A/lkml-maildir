I've accomplished this before, just not with the bridging code.. 
There is (at least when I did this w/ 2.0 kernel) a flag you can pass to
arp to make the linux box proxy arp for all addresses on one side to the
other. Then you enable packet forwarding and use normal IP filtering. 
This weird arp masqueraid is much like a bridge but you can use IP
filtering. I did this so that I could transparently drop a firewall into
an existing network.
