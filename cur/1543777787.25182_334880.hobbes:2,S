What is your program ??? what it is doing ??? Can u explain ?? or send
some code portion ?? b/c the BIGMEM kernel and smp/normal kenel has
only a difference of HIGHMEM64G which allows system/kernel on x86 to
use physical memory upto 64GB ..... and enabling this creates
little-bit overhead on the kernel, but I don't think it will effect
the working of most of the kernel modules ......

I don't know abt this, so can't say any thing ....

I think this can be done through specifying GFP_ATOMIC flag in the
memory allocation function, so that it will use ZONE_NORMAL of the
kernel ....... (if i m wrong, then plzz do correct me)
