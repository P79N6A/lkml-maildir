that's a choice Ubuntu made in their udev scripts... if you don't like
it, complain to them.
I'm surprised you would even need to care about what device name things
are though.... with mount-by-label (deployed for a bunch of years now
in most distros), and various helpful links like /dev/cdrom ....
anyway.. if you don't like your distros udev configuration, lkml is the
wrong forum.
