In that case, the "registry" won't work either. If you can't
access the file-system that contains the "registry" (it's just
a corrupt file), to get the bits necessary to turn on your
controller, then you need to use a serial EEPROM or some such
as is done all the while.
Over and over again, I hear people who think that you should
be able to open a file from within the code that opens the
file (the kernel). Turns out, you now can. You can create
a task called a "kernel thread". Since it has a context, it
can open a file and read from it (not using any user-mode
interface). But this won't help you either because the
file won't exist until you configure your controller
and it gets mounted.
