While you are at it: Could you please avoid calculating current over 
and over again? 
Just calculate it once and use the task_struct pointer.
If I do this for some random occurances of "current" in fs/exec.c I get this
on Linus' latest git tree:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   9501      84      12    9597    257d old/fs/exec.o
   9386      84      12    9482    250a new/fs/exec.o
Do you see any side effects, except reduced size 
and increased performance here?
Is a patch doing this for the whole file welcome, if you are too busy?
Regards
Ingo Oeser
