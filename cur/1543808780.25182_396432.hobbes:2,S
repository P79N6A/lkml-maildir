The UDF code really seems broken. It fails for new inodes and some
chown cases, when the mount options are being used. Phillip's patch
does not look like a complete fix, though, as it will store invalid
uid/gid (-1) for some cases where we probably should be storing the
real uid/gid. For example, doing chown <user> when the same user is
passed as mount option, we'll get -1 on disk, instead of user's uid.
I think the semantics you want is: "if uid/gid is invalid on disk,
leave it that way unless we explicitly change it via chown; otherwise
we can always overwrite it." Hmm?
