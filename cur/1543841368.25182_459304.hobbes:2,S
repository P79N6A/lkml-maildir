Anton or Nathan - did you get a chance to test this patch?
I finally got my hands on a hotplug capable system - just 4 CPUs and 1
memory node (SMP, not NUMA).  This patch plugged and unplugged CPUs ok
from what I could see, updating the cpuset 'cpus' files as intended.
I am confident it's a good patch.
