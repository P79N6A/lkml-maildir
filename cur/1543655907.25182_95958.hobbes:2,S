Let me know if it helps. I'm currently using the Debian sources, though I've 
tried the original sources also, and besides failing to mount root (initrd, 
etc - don't ask) the error messages were still there. Even so, I'm able to 
have DMA on my HDs without any problems, it seems.

I have two drives, one a CD-RW, the other a DVD. Both my DVD drive and my 
CD-RW drive complain during boot (though the DVD drive has many more 
messages). The DVD won't work, but my CD-RW drive still manages to end up 
working through scd0 (it used to work on scd1, though).
Peace,
Brendon
