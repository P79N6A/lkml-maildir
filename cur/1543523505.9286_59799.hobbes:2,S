if your new code reorders stuff  to fit the cache better, but the old code
does not then your new code will do better in comparisen then if both sets
get teh optimization.

if you dynamicly change from one to the other how can you benchmark the
two to see where the proper place to switch over is? Also the test that
you have in to use one or the other is pure overhead, for benchmarking it
would be better to have two kernels, one with each scheduler and no test
to choose between them.
As I was pointing out if the crossover point is low enough it may end up
being correct to use the new scheduler all the time for boxes with more
CPUs
