 It's fixed in 2.4.27-pre3 and later.  Coincidentally or not, it was
released only 4 days after I mentioned the bug on debian-amd64 and
discuss@x86-64.  I'd narrow it down further, but kernel.org doesn't have -bk
patches for 2.4, and I don't know where to download more fine-grained patch
versions.
 (BTW, 2.4.27-pre6 doesn't compile without declaring 
struct task_struct *tsk;  in rwsem-spinlock.c:__rwsem_wake_one_writer.)
 Thanks for the help.
