Why is xen special from the rest of the kernel in regards to adding
files to sysfs?  What does your infrastructure add that is not currently
already present for everyone to use today?

Why is the xen version any different from any other module or driver
version in the kernel? (hint, use the interface that is availble for
this already...)

You have access to the current tree as well as we do to be able to
answer this question :)

You don't have to create a driver subsystem to be able to add stuff to
sysfs, what makes you think that?

No, they belong in the sysfs tree like everything else.  Unless you have
process specific attributes, do NOT add anything new to /proc.

did you look at debugfs?  configfs?
What is wrong with the current kobject/sysfs/driver model interface that
made you want to create this extra code?
Aren't you already going to have a xen virtual bus in sysfs and the
driver model?  Why not just put your needed attributes there, where they
belong (on the devices themselves)?

Your patch is linewrapped :(

Don't create your own, use dev_dbg() and friends instead.  pr_debug if
you absolutely don't have access to a struct device.

Heh, what OS is this code for?

No, don't add this, it's pointless.

No, that will just break sparse.  Why did you add this?

Why?

Why a binary attribute?  Do you want to have more than one single piece
of info in here?  If so, no.
I'll stop here and say that you should use the internal-to-IBM code
review process, it would probably save you a lot of time in the
future...
