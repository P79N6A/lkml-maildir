I think he is talking about the timeslice granularity Ingo readded in
his latest patch (TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY, which is 25ms with HZ=1000).
Every 25ms the currently running task is preempted if there is another
runnable task at its current priority. I.e., tasks at the same priority
are round-robined every 25ms, until there timeslices expire.

Yep, and I don't think Ingo's patch would effect this.
