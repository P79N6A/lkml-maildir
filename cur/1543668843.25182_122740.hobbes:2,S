I'm not convinced that we can't do something with nonlinear mappings for
this ... we just need to keep a list of linear areas within the nonlinear
vmas, and use that to do the objrmap stuff with. Dave and I talked about
this yesterday ... we both had different terminology, but I think the
same underlying fundamental concept ... I was calling them "sub-vmas"
for each linear region within the nonlinear space. 
The fundamental problem I came to (and I think Dave had the same problem) 
is that I couldn't see what problem remap_file_pages was trying to solve,
so it was tricky to see if we'd cause the same thing or not. sub-vmas
could certainly be a lot smaller, but we weren't thinking of 128K of the
damned things, so ... the other thing is of course the setup and teardown
time ... but the could be a btree or something for the structure.
Of course, if we did this, it would get rid of the whole conversion
to and from object based stuff ;-) I think Dave had some other bright
idea on this too, but I don't recall what it was ;-(

eh? Not sure what you mean by that. It helped massively ...
diffprofile from kernbench showed:
     -4666   -74.9% page_add_rmap
    -10666   -92.0% page_remove_rmap
I'd say that about an 85% reduction in cost is pretty damned fine ;-)
And that was about a 20% overall reduction in the system time for the
test too ... that was all for partial objrmap (file backed, not anon).
