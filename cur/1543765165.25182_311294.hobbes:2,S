I'll do that - trouble is round where I am they dish out Nvidia cards
like confetti, I've got them in the machine I use most and another 2 and
you have to do all that gyrating with running the script to FTP down and
build the secret module before you can run X. This is a big disincentive
when it comes to installing new kernels.
I wish some kind soul would speak nicely to Nvidia and get them to see
reason on the point but I suspect I'm not the first person to wish that.
(Or is there a sneaky way of patching the modules so they'll work in
another kernel without tainting it?).
