... is what I got when testing it here. It seems that nice levels
REALLY mean something with the patch applied ;)
You can get it at 
http://www.surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.3ac4-largenice
Since there seems to be quite a bit of demand for this feature,
please test it and try to make it break. If it doesn't break we
can try to put it in the kernel...
regards,
Rik
