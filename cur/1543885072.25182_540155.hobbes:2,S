I can boot it hitting SysReq+K, but only in text mode. X start but I
can't do login (the mouse moves but I cant enter username and
password). Furthermore if I hit some key in GDM I can't switch to text
console anymore. If I switch to text-mode after boot all seems to
work. Maybe this is related to some important process I kill with the
SysReq key.
I'm quite confident the system blocks on "Setting consoles fonts and
modes.", and thus during the boot script console-screen.h. I'll try to
see which commands blocks...
BTW, I've tried the serial port in text mode. With the patch, flushing
the input results effectively in a complete flush. However after doing
the flush I can't read any char anymore without closing and reopening
the port. I've verified this behavior both communicating between two
serial port and both communicating with an usb-serial device (driver
cdc-acm).
