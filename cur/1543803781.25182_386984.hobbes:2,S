It's ECC memory, I'd doubt it.

You're saying that I'll have to spend all the afternoon watching
DVDs? Well, if the linux kernel needs it!

Yes, I run several "cat /dev/zero > /dev/null &" and they all kept in
CPU #0. 
I did a bitsection search and I couldn't found the culprit, apparently
it is caused by a config option; now it works fine after switching off
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU and some ACPI options. Also, when it didn't work
the CPU that would get all the processes could be CPU #0 or #1 - it
changed randomly depending on the boot.
