They are not released by Linus, so why would they be in his tree?  :)
As per the release announcements, they are located in either:
	pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/linux-2.6.15.y.git
or
	pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/chrisw/linux-2.6.15.y.git
depending on who did the release.  Check the lkml message for specifics
on which it is.
Hope this helps,
greg k-h
