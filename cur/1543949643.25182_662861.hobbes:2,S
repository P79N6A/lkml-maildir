OK, the patch will stick with the two-stage registration model to give
a safe initialization time for LSMs.
james: Could you please make it OK to use the atomic counter instead of
       the spinlock ? It'll just add unneeded complexity. We only set
       `chosen_lsm' once at the parameters parsing time. 
Changes (per James suggestions):
- Added a BUG_ON(!ops->name).
- Removed a redundant setting of last string character to NULL.
Sample Output:
[    0.065487] SELinux:  Initializing.
[    0.067115] SELinux:  Starting in permissive mode
[    0.067186] Smack:  Another security module was chosen.
[    0.067345] Smack:  Use security=smack to force loading Smack on boot.
-->
Add the security= boot parameter. This is done to avoid LSM 
registration clashes in case of more than one bult-in module.
User can choose a security module to enable at boot. If no 
security= boot parameter is specified, only the first LSM 
asking for registration will be loaded. An invalid security 
module name will be treated as if no module has been chosen.
LSM modules must check now if they are allowed to register
by calling security_module_enable(ops) first. Modify SELinux 
and SMACK to do so.
