The problem is clear:
rtl8139_resume() unconditionally restarts the hardware, even if the
network was not yet started.
The hardware immediately notices something, and sends an interrupt.
The oops happens during rtl8139_open():
the function calls request_irq(), but assumes that the interrupts are
still disabled from the initial rtl8139_init_one(). Thus an interrupt
arrives before the driver structures are initialized.
Jeff, it seems that rtl8139_suspend() and rtl8139_resume() should check
if the nic was opened before stopping/restarting the hardware.
