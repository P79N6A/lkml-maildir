In this code too.. lost-wakeup problem is not solved
if (event_occured)
  else 
    schedule();
what if in check ' if(event_occured) ' goes to 'else'
and before calling schedule() my ISR interrupted this
thread and set the event..
Also Mike told to disable the interrupt before
checking for event... So When to enable interrupts
then ??
