Hi Guys,
I have found the old mailing list archives for the vesafbd project I was 
interested in, but I can't seem to get in touch with the original author 
and the web pages are all gone. The guys name was Aki M Laukkanen and he 
was at the University of Helsinki through most of 2000 (and active within 
the Linux kernel community during that time). If anyone knows him or his 
current email address, please drop him a line for me and tell him to 
email me so we can get in touch.
Thanks!
