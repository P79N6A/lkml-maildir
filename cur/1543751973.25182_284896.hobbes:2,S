One option would be a "Linux Legacy" project, similar to the Fedora
Legacy project that backports updates to old Red Hat/Fedora Core
releases: a central service that'd collect bug fixes for released
kernels that distributors could then base their kernels on. That way,
we'd get the stability advantages of vendor kernels without needing to
repeat the effort for each distribution.
Maybe some of the distribution vendors might be interested in setting
up something like this?
