Watch carefully. FAT (_and_ HPFS) doesn't allow files with holes. First of
all it _does_ touch FAT-specific fields (albeit i_size) would probably be
OK with some tweaking. Yes, it might make sense to move it into buffer.c.
But it's _not_ an equivalent of the generic one. Heck, have you ever tried
the result of your changes?
