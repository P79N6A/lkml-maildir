Eeep - I must admit to being somewhat baffled where it is coming from
too. Its occurring between the rmmod starting and the userspace
notifiers from the syslog ordering but I don't see anything that would
queue flushes on the IDE side. The power management does check and
issues WIN_FLUSH_CACHE* stuff. The cd layer only seems to issue it in
the dvd rw close path and that checks media written and mmc3 bits or in
places like cdrom_mrw_exit.
One possibility might be that the specific drive is incorrectly
reporting capabilities and register_cdrom is setting cdi->exit as a
result. Will try and work out what is going on there tomorrow.
