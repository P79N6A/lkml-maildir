First WTF does it need swiotlb anyways? QA hardware should
be definitely DAC capable, shouldn't it?

Another reason is that there is a lot of code that
still doesn't check the return values and when that
happens you might get data corruption too.

A different interface; like I wrote in my earlier mail.
Another probabibility would be to have a blocking interface
to swiotlb that won't fail. That would be the better solution
long term, but i was told it is hard to fit into some current
driver interfaces.
