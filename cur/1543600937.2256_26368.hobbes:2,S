Unfortunately, it is the linuxthreads code that is broken
on the sh4 platform.  It seems that the pointers are moved 
due to cache aliasing.  I am trying to raise awareness that
this is breaking pthreads applications on sh4-linux.
Following is the relevant segment of linuxthreads that is
broken:
In function pthread_allocate_stack(), file manager.c:
.......
#  ifdef _STACK_GROWS_DOWN
      new_thread = default_new_thread;
      new_thread_bottom = (char *) (new_thread + 1) - stacksize;
      map_addr = new_thread_bottom - guardsize;
      res_addr = mmap(map_addr, stacksize + guardsize,
                      PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
                      MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
      if (res_addr != map_addr)
        {
          /* Bad luck, this segment is already mapped. */
          if (res_addr != MAP_FAILED)
            munmap (res_addr, stacksize + guardsize);
          return -1;
        }
.......
We resort to patching the MAP_FIXED back to linuxthreads
until we get a resolution on this problem.
Thanks.
