I believe that you get 100% write throughput, but in many systems read
requests are much more frequent than writes. I'd be insterested how good
is read performance. Wouldn't your data get too fragmented? If you
hadn't ported any applications to Eros yet, I wonder if you get good read
performance in real enviroment.

I don't think it is really so important. If system crashes, something is
bad anyway, and you should cure the causation (fix bugs), not the
consequence (do quick recovery).
Power fault is another case, but I think it really doesn't matter if
system is down for 3 hours because of power fault or 3 hours and 10
minutes because of power fault and fsck.
