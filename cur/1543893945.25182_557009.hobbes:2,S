Nope. Merely stating a distinction. Either a device is distributed, like the 
common PC, that is designed for the user to change and update the software 
on, or, like the PS2 it isn't designed for that. If I find a way to update my 
PS2 to run Linux and find that it doesn't want to start the "Linux Firmware" 
because I'm lacking a signing key...
In the case of a device that internally runs Linux (or any other GPL'd 
software) and wasn't designed for the end-user to change the software running 
on it then the signing keys aren't part of the source. OTOH, if I sell a PC 
running Linux that requires the kernel be signed then the signing keys *are* 
part of the source, since a PC is designed for the end-user to change the 
software running on it.
BTW, nice use of irony with that line. Makes me regret letting my fingers get 
ahead of my brain.

Never claimed it did. I just wasn't as specific as I should have been when 
giving my examples.

No. It all depends on the use-case. If the hardware is designed for the user 
to install their own, custom versions of the code on then the signing keys 
are part of the source as defined by the GPLv2.
If, OTOH, the hardware was never meant for the end-user to install custom 
versions of the software on, then while the signing keys are still 
*technically* part of the source, in practice they are not. Why? Because in 
most of those cases the end-user isn't granted the right to install and run 
custom binaries on the hardware. If the manufacturer provided the signing 
keys they'd be facilitating the commission of a crime. (call it "Breach of 
Contract")

I know this. As I said, I doubt that anyone who tried this in America would 
have the success he has had.
