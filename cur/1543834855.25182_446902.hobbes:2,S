Are you sure this test is testing what you think it is testing?
I just ran my system with the stock 2.6.18 kernel and TSC enabled.
I ran PN! on a varying load long enough for the clocks to become
completely unglued.  The time delta on the command `date;sleep 5;
date` was going from -10 to 30 seconds.  However, the results
of your test show no problems:
