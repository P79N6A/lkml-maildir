This doesn't seem to be doing what you want, even if it seems to work.
If you want there to be one free page less, then allocating it will
work regardless. What are you looking for besides that? If it's not
already working you want some additional semantics. Could this involve
is_head_of_free_region()? That should be solvable with a per-cpu list
shootdown algorithm to fully merge all the buddy bitmap things.
