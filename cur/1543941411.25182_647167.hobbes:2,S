    suspend: cleanup reference to swsusp_pg_dir[]
    
    swsusp_pg_dir[] is used for suspend, but not for hibernation.
    clean-up the ifdefs which worked by accident, while implying the opposite.
    Delete the __nosavedata, which also implied the opposite.
    
    Some day we may optimize CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP to build minimal kernels
    for just hibernate or just suspend but not both,
    but today isn't that day.

    Suspend: Invoke suspend notifications after console switch
    
    In order to fix APM emulation it is necessary to enable apm-emulation
    notifications for suspends triggered in various ways via the suspend
    notifiers.  However, this will cause the systems using APM emulation
    to lock up between X being needed to switch away from the VT and X
    already waiting for resume in the APM ioctl.
    
    This patch moves the console switch (if enabled) before the suspend
    notification (and after the resume notification) to avoid this issue.

    ACPI hibernation: Call _PTS before suspending devices
    
    The ACPI 1.0 specification wants us to put devices into low power
    states after executing the _PTS global control method, while ACPI
    2.0 and later want us to do that in the reverse order.  The current
    hibernation code follows ACPI 2.0 in that respect which may cause some
    ACPI 1.0x systems to hang during hibernation (ref.
    
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9528
).
    
    Make the hibernation code execute _PTS before putting devices into
    low power states (ie. in accordance with ACPI 1.0x) with the
    possibility to override that using the 'acpi_new_pts_ordering' kernel
    command line option.

    ACPI: Separate disabling of GPEs from _PTS
    
    The preparation to enter an ACPI system sleep state is now tied to
    the disabling of GPEs, but the GPEs should not be disabled before
    suspending devices.  Since on ACPI 1.0x systems the _PTS global
    control method should be executed before suspending devices, we
    need to disable GPEs separately.

    ACPI: Separate invocations of _GTS and _BFS from _PTS and _WAK
    
    The execution of ACPI global control methods _GTS and _BFS is
    currently tied to the preparation to enter a sleep state and to the
    leaving of the sleep state, respectively.  However, these functions
    are called before disabling the nonboot CPUs and after enabling
    them, respectively (in fact, on ACPI 1.0x systems the first of them
    ought to be called before suspending devices), while according to the
    ACPI specification, _GTS is to be executed right prior to entering
    the system sleep state and _BFS is to be executed right after the
    platfor firmware has returned control to the OS on wake up.
    
    Move the execution of _GTS and _BFS to the right places.

    Suspend: Introduce begin() and end() callbacks
    
    On ACPI systems the target state set by acpi_pm_set_target() is
    reset by acpi_pm_finish(), but that need not be called if the
    suspend fails.  All platforms that use the .set_target() global
    suspend callback are affected by analogous issues.
    
    For this reason, we need an additional global suspend callback that
    will reset the target state regardless of whether or not the suspend
    is successful.  Also, it is reasonable to rename the .set_target()
    callback, since it will be used for a different purpose on ACPI
    systems (due to ACPI 1.0x code ordering requirements).
    
    Introduce the global suspend callback .end() to be executed at the
    end of the suspend sequence and rename the .set_target() global
    suspend callback to .begin().

    Hibernation: Move low level resume to disk.c
    
    Move the low level restore code to kernel/power/disk.c , since the
    corresponding low level hibernation code is already there.
    
    Make restore fail if device_power_down(PMSG_PRETHAW) returns an
    error.

    PM: Convert PM notifiers to out-of-line code
    
    This patch (as1008b) converts the PM notifier routines from inline
    calls to out-of-line code.  It also prevents pm_chain_head from
    being created when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP isn't enabled, and EXPORTs the
    notifier registration and unregistration routines.

    PM: Make PM_TRACE more architecture independent
    
    When trying to debug a suspend failure I started implementing
    PM_TRACE for powerpc. I then noticed that I'm debugging a suspend
    failure and so PM_TRACE isn't useful at all, but thought that
    nonetheless this could be useful in the future.
    
    Basically, to support PM_TRACE, you add a Kconfig option that
    selects PM_TRACE and provides the infrastructure as per the
    help text of PM_TRACE.

    Hibernation: New testing facility (rev. 2)
    
    Make it possible to test the hibernation core code with the help of the
    /sys/power/pm_test attribute introduced for suspend testing in the previous
    patch.
    
    Writing an appropriate string to this file causes the hibernation code to work
    in one of the test modes defined as follows:
    
    freezer
    - test the freezing of processes
    
    devices
    - test the freezing of processes and suspending of devices
    
    platform
    - test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices and platform global
      control methods(*)
    
    processors
    - test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices, platform global
      control methods(*) and the disabling of nonboot CPUs
    
    core
    - test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices, platform global
      control methods(*), the disabling of nonboot CPUs and suspending of
      platform/system devices
    
    (*) - the platform global control methods are only available on ACPI systems
          and are only tested if the hibernation mode is set to "platform"
    
    Then, if a hibernation is started by normal means, the hibernation core will
    perform its normal operations up to the point indicated by given test level.
    Next, it will wait for 5 seconds and carry out the resume operations needed to
    transition the system back to the fully functional state.

    Suspend: Testing facility (rev. 2)
    
    Introduce sysfs attribute /sys/power/pm_test allowing one to test the suspend
    core code.  Namely, writing one of the strings:
    
    freezer
    devices
    platform
    processors
    core
    
    to this file causes the suspend code to work in one of the test modes defined as
    follows:
    
    freezer
    - test the freezing of processes
    
    devices
    - test the freezing of processes and suspending of devices
    
    platform
    - test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices and platform global
      control methods(*)
    
    processors
    - test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices, platform global
      control methods and the disabling of nonboot CPUs
    
    core
    - test the freezing of processes, suspending of devices, platform global
      control methods, the disabling of nonboot CPUs and suspending of
      platform/system devices
    
    (*) These are ACPI global control methods on ACPI systems
    
    Then, if a suspend is started by normal means, the suspend core will perform
    its normal operations up to the point indicated by given test level.  Next, it
    will wait for 5 seconds and carry out the resume operations needed to transition
    the system back to the fully functional state.
    
    Writing "none" to /sys/power/pm_test turns the testing off.
    
    When open for reading, /sys/power/pm_test contains a space-separated list of all
    available tests (including "none" that represents the normal functionality) in
    which the current test level is indicated by square brackets.

    Hibernation: Rework platform support ioctls (rev. 2)
    
    Modify the hibernation userland interface by adding two new ioctls to it,
    SNAPSHOT_PLATFORM_SUPPORT and SNAPSHOT_POWER_OFF, that can be used,
    respectively, to switch the hibernation platform support on/off and to make the
    kernel transition the system to the hibernation state (eg. ACPI S4) using the
    platform (eg. ACPI) driver.
    
    These ioctls are intended to replace the misdesigned SNAPSHOT_PMOPS ioctl,
    which from now is regarded as obsolete and will be removed in the future.
