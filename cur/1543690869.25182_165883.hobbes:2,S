Alan,
Taking you at face value, as always in the past, how does one parse
between "usage"/"enforcement"?
Can a non-gpl object call, use, and it work "EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL"?
If EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL allows functionality, then it does not "enforce" any
license issues.  If it is called and then allowed to quietly fail or not
function unless the caller's associated LICENSE is "GPL", then it does
enforce, restrict and prevents 'functional' usage.
If this is a "NEW SYMBOL" one may have an arguement to hold.
If it is an "OLD SYMBOL", or the old one is removed and replaced with an
random new one, yet the core functionality of the operations are the same,
the intent is to break or terminate usage.
If EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is to be a notifier to let end-user be aware that a
binary vendor may be operating in a grey region of "derived" work, fine.
Allow it to operate but make noise.
Pretend it is doing the NOVELL thing of exceeding license count, and make
noise.
It is all to simple to bypass, and if the TAINTING issues for detection
is truly only to ignore issues from non-gpl sourced drivers, then great.
I know you have killfiled me by now, but how goes business school for the
MBA?  Does this mean you are going to quit Linux?
Cheers,
