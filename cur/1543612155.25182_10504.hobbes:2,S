It probably is much slower, because it does networking from userspace
(permitting things like ssl channels, automatic reconnects and other
fallover-like things). Nevertheless, I get about 18MB/s writing to
localhost on my 366MHz portable, and about 5MB/s doing raid resync
across NBD to scsi devices across 100BT. Come to think of it, maybe
that IS the speed of the scsi devices, they're a raid5 assembly running
as a raid0 component connected by NBD .... 
Here's the printout from the device itself in my max speed test on the
portable in my hands. It seems to be still running (kernel 2.4.3 plus
xfs)
   ...
   [b] B/s max:    18.6M   (0R+18.6MW)
   [b] Spectrum:   70%23   15%102  12%252
   ...
   
(uh, the last line is the size-of-sent-request spectrum, data in 1K blocks
- it looks like I thumped it with 16MB of data to write at once in the
test and varied the max limit continuously as I did so, but there was
only time for three limit changes)
Read is always fast, of course.

But then you are talking about kernel 2.2, not kernel 2.4, surely?
There is now a -pre for DRDB under kernels 2.4, but I didn't think
there was several months ago.

The real difficulty is in user space with the reconnect strategies and
what to do with the various weird tcp states you can get into. The
test above was trying to produce a classic deadlock to localhost, but
didn't "succeed".
