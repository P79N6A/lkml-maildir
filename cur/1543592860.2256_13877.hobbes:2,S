The bounces can came from the ZONE_NORMAL without problems, however the
ZONE_DMA32 way is fine too, but yes probably it isn't needed in real
life unless you do an huge amount of I/O at the same time. If you want
to reduce the amount of changes you can defer the zone_dma32 patch and
possibly plug it in later.
