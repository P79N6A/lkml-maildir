Tried again without the framebuffer.  Still hanging, but more info:
Last messages before getting stuck:
md autorun DONE
kjournald starting
Ext3-fs mounted fs w. ordered data mode
VFS mounted root (ext3) read-only
freeing unused kernel memory 216k freed.
warning-unable to open an initial console
kernel panic-not syncing:No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel
Somewhat silly. There certainly was a console (vgacon) or I wouldn't
be able to read the messages.  And if it mounted root, then there certainly
was an init to run also.
SYSRQ P  (Omitting lots of time-consuming hex numbers, please tell
if those are really needed.)
sysrq: show regs
cpu 0
Pid:1, comm: swapper not tainted 2.6.14-rc4-mm1 #17
RIP  {__delay+4}
(Omitted register dump)
Call trace:

vgacon_cursor+0
init+543
child_rip+8

child_rip+0
SYSRQ T  gave me several pages, with no scrollback.  Several kernel
threads and their stack dumps.  Simplified:
kedac     R running task
md2       S
md3       S
md0       S
kjournald S
I can provide the full 80x50 page, but I have to write it down by hand
so only if someone actually think it will be useful.
That EDAC thing was new in rc4-mm1, compared to rc3.  I am testing
another rc4-mm1 kernel without it.  (menuconfig adviced me to say Y
to the new EDAC thing, so I did that initially.)
