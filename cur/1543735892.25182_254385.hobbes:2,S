hi,
the error occurs with any navigator and only with the kernel 2.6.8
the javascript on an https interactive site of a bank won't display the full page 
and hang in the middle .
But with the kernel 2.6.7 on same machine with same programs there is no problem
the full page is displayed.
I can reproduce the problem on different machines.
I'd like  to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments posted to the list in response to my posting.
Thanks
