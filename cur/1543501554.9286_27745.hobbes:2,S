At risk of adding further off-topicness to this thread, but for sake of
completeness - I've been using:
:0:
* ^From owner-linux-kernel-outgoing@vger.rutgers.edu
linux-kernel
for ages, with not even a single message missed. Note that this is 'From'
and not 'From:'. It does a perfect job discriminating between stuff that
goes to me directly and stuff that goes to the list, because only things
sent by the list are caught.
The only problem I can see with that is that if owner-linux-kernel-outgoing
is used for any other purpose - things would break. Is there such a problem
out there?
