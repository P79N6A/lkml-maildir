Well, writing dirty data to swap does not look like too bad
problem. If it simplifies things, I'm happy with dirty data in swap.

...introducing another "half-of-kernelmemory" limitation. [Did you see
people hitting half-of-memory problem in practice?].
How is it possible that copying into activelist & inactivelist helps?
If memorymanagment is working correctly then those lists should be
empty...
I know you are not freeing memory agresively.. But perhaps you have
exactly same "half-of-memory" problem as 2.6.0-test9 implementation
has?

No assembly, please. Nicer macros would be welcome, through. No macros
would be best ;-).
Deadlocks... any user process stopped with sigstop should not block
anything in-kernel, right? That means that perhaps we need to be more
clever about kernel threads, but we should be able to get away without
hooks in paths such as "sys_read()". If killall -SIGSTOP can stop the
processes safely without additional hooks, we should be able to do
that, too...
