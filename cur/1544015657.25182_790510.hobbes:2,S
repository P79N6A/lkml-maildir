FWIW, I am looking over the thinkpad-acpi side of this.  I like the idea,
but I am not completely sure I agree fully with the changes to
thinkpad-acpi.
Which isn't a problem, as long as the thinkpad-acpi hunks are NOT merged to
any tree before my ACK, please.  I will test and comment on the patch before
the weekend.
