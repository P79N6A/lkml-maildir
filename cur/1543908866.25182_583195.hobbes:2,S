I haven't seen a patch yet.  I'm going to resubmit with inline volatile-cast 
atomic[64]_[read|set] on all architectures as a reference point, and if anyone 
wants to go and implement some of them in assembly, that's between them and the 
relevant arch maintainers.  I have no problem with (someone else) doing it in 
assembly.  I just don't think it's necessary and won't let it hold up the effort 
to get consistent behavior on all architectures.
