	Memory is continuously too small and too expensive.  Even if you
can buy a machine with 10TB of RAM, the price is going to be
prohibitive.  And when 10TB of RAM costs better, the database is going
to be 100TB.
	I'm not saying that in-memory is bad.  Big databases do
everything they can to make the workload look almost like in-memory.
It's the only way to go.

	I don't need O_DIRECT with bad semantics.  I need the semantics
I need, I know that other OSes have O_DIRECT to provide those
capabilities, and everyone loves portability.  That said...

	Sure, but you don't do that.  The breakage in mixing O_DIRECT
with pagecache I/O to the same areas of the disk isn't even all that
subtle.  But you shouldn't be doing that, at least constantly.

	I'm not fixated.  "Use this user page for the page cache entry
for this offset into the file", "Change this user page from representing
this offset in this file to representing that offset in that file", and
"whatever you do, always read/write from backing store for this page"
are the semantics needed.  For the latter, you'd have to have a way for
the app to trigger a read or write out of the cache.  You don't want to
do it on every page modification or access, that's too often.  The
application knows the syncronization points, not the kernel.
