Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] Kconfig help: MTD_JEDECPROBE already supports Intel chips
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/24/248

Unless I'm misunderstanding the code in jedec_probe.c, Intel chips are 
already supported.
