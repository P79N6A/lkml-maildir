Would it help to make CONFIG_NUM_LSMS a boot time option, and default
to 1?
As for justification, the fact that many LSMS currently cannot be
used simultaneously seemed the most prominent.  It certainly seems viable
to use SELinux to protect audit logs and shadow files, use bsdjail to
offer certain services, and use securelevel for some generic hardening,
for instance.

This was one cpu.  (All I have available at the moment)

I will run lmbench tomorrow, and look for some network benchmark.
