Yes!!! For those of us who need (for various reasons) to work below the
level of GLibc it is currently a nightmare trying to pick apart the
calling conventions for each syscall.
Of course it is not only syscalls; but also signal numbering and other
constants.
(Oh bonus points for sharing as much of this between architectures as
possible and just having the differences in architecture specific
files).
