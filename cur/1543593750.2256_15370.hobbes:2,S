I'll be posting a patch in a few minutes (against 2.4.5-acX, which
was the latest kernel available to me while on holidays with no
net access) which doesn't "roll over" the inactive dirty pages when
we scan the list.
This should make us reclaim the inactive_dirty pages in a much better
LRU order, so this whole background aging limiting stuff becomes close
to moot.

Rik
