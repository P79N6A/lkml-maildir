Thank you for your vote for a user library implementation of compound
files. This is the traditional Unix answer to such things, that's
more-or-less how Windows and NT deals with such files.

There's no reason why a user library implementation would have to be
stupid. For example, you could re-invent a simple filesystem in a flat
file. The minus is that you have to re-invent some code which is
almost the right stuff in the kernel. The plus is that it's easy to
pass around, and you didn't change the kernel. Another minus is that
existing commands such as "cat" aren't going to do anything nice on
these documents.
Every approach has minuses. That's why there's no consensus.
