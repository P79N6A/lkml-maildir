Greetings Everyone.
The new, shiny 0.2alpha.3 release is ready to test it, smash it and blow
it off ;-)
The major improvement is support for other SIR speeds: 2400 through
115200 bps. Well I think they will work but frankly speaking I haven't
tested them because my Handspring always negotiates the highest rate.
I am sure there is quite a lot of bugs left so *please* test it as much
as you can. I am realy convinced that performance may be a really big
problem so I will appreciate any comments on the design.

To answer your question: I will make a patch but let me first be sure it
is usable and at least beta-stable. You can help ;-)
Always yours.
