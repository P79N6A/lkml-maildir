To the best of my knowledge, there is presently no way to change the arp 
behavior of Linux such that it uses the interface-based arp mechanizm in 
  a manner compatable with load-balancing and hot-standby techniques 
involving aliasing the loopback interface.  In all the proposed 
solutions the cache-update by an arp request problem still exists (arp 
source ip problem).
I would love to be proven wrong.  Presently I have to either patch the 
kernel or suffer the throughput penalty of doing dnat to myself, all to 
do something that Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, *BSD, and even Windows can do 
natively.
