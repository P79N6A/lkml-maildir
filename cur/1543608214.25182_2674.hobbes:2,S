Look I tested it, and I provided code to test it! You will not
convince the 'C' compiler to do:
	addl	$1, c
	adcl	$0, c+4
... with a long long (at least not egcs-2.91.66). Further, that's
not the whole story. If jiffies is a long long, then every operation
on that counter, all the timing queues, sleeps, etc., end up doing
multiple operations on the long long (which I showed on Monday with
some additional, best possible, code).
... which is code I showed initially. Knowing that the C compiler
does the jumps on condition and tests for zero, even after the
flags have been set by the previous operation, I tested what
the result was. It turns out that it's only a couple of clock
cycles, not the 6 extra clocks that the hand calculation shows.
So, if you leave jiffies alone, but bump another variable when it
wraps, you get to eat your cake and keep it too.
Cheers,
