Nice, it seems to work.
Unfortunately first merge will make it practically unusable :-(. 
git diff -r origin:
will only list differences between my tree and Linus'.
git patch origin:
will list my patches, plus any merges I done... Is there any
reasonable way to get only "my" changes? When I do not have to resolve
anything during merge, it should be usable... but that is starting to
look ugly.
