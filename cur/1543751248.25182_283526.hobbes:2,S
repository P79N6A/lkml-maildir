Andrew just suggested to wait on any random page. That's a minor
modification to that logic. Effectively it's stupid to wait on a
specific random page, when we can wait wait on _any_ random page to
complete the writeback I/O.
With locking done right by setting the state to uninterruptible and
then registering in the new waitqueue when we know at least one page has
PG_writeback set, we can then drop the HZ anti-deadlock hacks too.
