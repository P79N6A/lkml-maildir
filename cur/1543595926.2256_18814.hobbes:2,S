Hi,
 with the newest kernel linux-2.4.5ac21 I am not able to activate
 the ppp network device an dits options. Regardless what I am doing,
 the setting will not be stored into .config...
 Any trick to avoid this ?
 Thanks for any help in advance!
 (PS: I am currently not on the kernel list, please answer also to my
  email address. Thank you!)
  keep hacking the right site of life ! :-)
