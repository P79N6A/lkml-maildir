Well, we have a global entity being protected -- the file_lock_list.
Clearly we don't want to use one of the existing per-inode semaphores
since semaphores have a noted bad effect on both benchmarks and real-world
scenarios.  And I don't think introducing a new per-inode lock would
really be welcome.
