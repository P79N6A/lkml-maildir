The kernel can't get this right - it doesn't know the usage
patterns/workloads, etc.  It's rather disappointing that distros appear
to have put so little work into finding ways of setting suitable values
for this, and for other tunables.
Maybe we should set them to 1%, or 99% or something similarly stupid to
force the issue.
yes, perhaps the kernel's default percentage should be larger on
smaller-memory systems.  And smaller on slow-disk systems.  etc.  But
initscripts already have all the information to do this, and have the
advantage that any such scripts are backportable to five-year-old kernels.
So I say leave it as-is.  If suse can come up with a scriptlet which scales
this according to memory size, disk speed, workload, etc then good for
them - it'll produce a better end result.
