Right, for example, USB has an isochronous transfer facility intended to 
support media applications, e.g., cameras, that require realtime 
bandwidth/latency guarantees.  The thing is, such guarantees have to be 
end-to-end in the media pipeline.  Sound is just one of the applications that 
needs the kind of realtime support we (or more properly, Davide) just 
proposed.
