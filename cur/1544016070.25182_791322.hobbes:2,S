| Well, linux/types.h is supposed to be a 'lightweight', 'core data types 
| only' kind of header file, so including it is not wrong per se.

Until such a file not passed to some *.S. For example for e820.h
we have it included to arch/x86/boot/header.S but fortunately
we're bound by __ASSEMBLY__. So there linux/types.h shouldn't hurt.
Will check others and report then.
