As I said before: the question was regarding _default_ byteorder.
Linus has said that he wants the byteorder to be little-endian and
that is it.
It's of no use to press me for architectural information on IA-64.
You'll just have to wait until the architecture is fully disclosed (or
live with what has been disclosed already).  Sorry.
