As far as I understand the numbering scheme, the 2.5 kernel leads to 2.6
series. 
Why not just reactivate the 2.5 kernel (Starting with i.e. 2.5.112 which
will lead to 2.6.12)?
There will be no change visible to end-users and developers - IMO - are
more flexible in any case. 
(I know I totally ignore some basic thoughts with that "idea".)
