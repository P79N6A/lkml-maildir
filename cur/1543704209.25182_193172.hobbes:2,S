It has NOTHING to do with VIA!
It has everything to do with a missing function th hpt366.c code.
It is all about what the FIFO thresholds are wrt to when interrupts are
issued and a pre-emptive like notification.
I am waiting on one of my customers report they are happy with the fix and
will ship the fix before I release it to the public.  I have this serious
problem on not testing volitale patches on the general masses.
In my opinion, after several weeks of hard-on testing, the changes are
clean, correct, and exact.
Noting this type of patch would not be doable, had I not split the
individual dma operations way back when.
And yes for the remainder of the peanut gallery, I will "SHUT UP" for now.
Cheers,
