Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 10, 2006 at 07:43:03AM CEST, I got a letter
where "Eric W. Biederman" <ebiederm@xmission.com> said that...

Ok, now I'm not completely following you. Only i386 and x86_64 appears
to provide the openat() syscall (only in new kernels, furthermore) and
glibc otherwise emulates openat(n, "relpath") with
open("/proc/self/fd/<n>/relpath"). I don't know of any other way how to
emulate it.

Right now I am having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time.  I think
I have forgotten this before.
