There is significant architectural difference between the two schemes.
Is the base driver an absolute minimal driver that only serves as a
switch to route into the other drivers, or does the base driver
contain all the common code? I'm in the common code camp, DaveA is in
the minimal switch camp.
Take memory management for example. I think the memory manager should
go into the base driver. The other strategy is for each driver to have
their own memory manager and then the base provides a way to select
which one is active. (Note that in all cases the complex part of
memory management is running in user space).

I have had no success in making this happen.

What is cooperation? Is it shared code in the base coordinating a
single state in the hardware, or is it save your state, I'm switching
to another driver, now I'm loading its state. We can't achieve
agreement on this.

Depends on what you mean by the kernel growing the emulator. I don't
want to put it in the kernel binary, but I would like to see it in the
kernel tree. It would use klibc and initramfs. There are some classes
of machines that cannot get video at boot without running the ROM.
Making this part of the boot process will guarantee that all cards
have been POSTed by the time normal user space is up.
