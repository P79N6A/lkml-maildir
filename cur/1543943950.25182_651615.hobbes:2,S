_pfn is variant of hungarian notation (just postfix instead of prefix); 
that is why I referred to it. 
Admittedly it was a little unfair pun with Ingo, but he really 
asked for it  in this case :-)

xxx_pfn is exactly that. 
BTW Coding style also recommends to use short variable names inside 
functions. Ingo asked me actually to violate that:
"
LOCAL variable names should be short, and to the point.  If you have
some random integer loop counter, it should probably be called "i".
Calling it "loop_counter" is non-productive, if there is no chance of it
being mis-understood.  Similarly, "tmp" can be just about any type of
variable that is used to hold a temporary value.
"
I used r for result in this case which is 100% conform to coding style.
