	Mainly it brings order to the usually chaotic /dev dir, and I think
it speeds thing a bit (maybe due to seaches improving thanks to this order)
but the most important thing is, IMHO, that it shows only what you have, I've
never understood how we could have a /proc virtual filesystem and don't 
have a /dev virtual filesystem, as it seems at least as natural as the /proc.
Anyway, it would be  an option, if you want you enable it or if you do 
not want it you just forget about it. 
	And finally you will make me happy, as patbching by hand your ac series 
in order to include it is really painfull :-)
	Thanks, and sorry for my English, but it is the only one I have...
