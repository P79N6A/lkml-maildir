But unregistering and re-registering is exactly what we want to avoid
in our case. We have still the same ccw device, it's only now
operational via another subchannel (i. e. the topology changed, but not
the device). If we unregistered the device, we would also kill the
associated block device(s), and if it had been mounted, we go boom.
(This is what currently happens without this patchset, and it may be
triggered by a short hardware outage we'd otherwise survive without a
problem.)
