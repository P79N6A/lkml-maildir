I rather wanted to say I absolutely don't see any correlation of your
PCI driver example to what we're discussing here.  PCI driver hardcode
ID tables because they are supposed to do that.  And if a PCI driver works
around hardware bugs for a specific subset of hardware it needs to use
an ID table for that one aswell.  And adding a strong comment about broken
hardware is considered to be just fine in Linux kernel land aswell.
Now to your reply.  We're not doomed if a driver re-implements "something"
we already have in common code.  We would be doomed if every driver
reimplements lots of things, that's why we push hard to avoid drivers
doing that.  It gets even more important if that "something" duplicated is
not some simple piece code but complex abstractions.

You're free to test it as much outside the kernel tree.  This might make
it more proven one day, but not automatically less of a mess.  The real
point here is that we already have a useful abstraction in that area, and
we spent a lot of work to make it proven and not a mess (or just a little
bit of a mess..), and thus we'd rather see people extending it reasonably
for their needs instead of duplicating lots of infastructure in less than
ideal ways.
