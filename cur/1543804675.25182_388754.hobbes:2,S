My "fix" was basically the result of converting to the platform
functions. It's hit or miss whether this works with tumbler too.
You can try the Ubuntu kernel packages (they can be unpacked and used on
non Ubuntu systems pretty easily) to see if it works for you. Tumbler
platform function conversion isn't even tested, so I'd be happy to hear
any feedback.
