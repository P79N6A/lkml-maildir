hmm ok so I want a function that takes a device as parameter, and checks
the state of that device for errors. Internally that probably has to go
via a function pointer somewhere to a device specific check method.
Or maybe a per test-type (pci parity / ECC / etc) check
int pci_check_parity_errors(struct pci_dev *dev, int flags);
something like that, or pci_check_and_clear_parity_errors()
(although that gets too long :)
drivers can call that, say, after firmware init or something to validate
their device is sanely connected. Maybe pci_enable_device() could call
it too.
This also needs a pci_suspend_parity_check() ... _resume_ ... so that
the driver can temporarily disable any checks, for example during device
reset/init. And then just before resume, it manually clears a check.

yes. I would NOT make it overly tunable btw. For many things a sane
default can be chosen, and the effect of picking a different tuning
isn't all that big. Maybe think of it this way: a tuneable to a large
degree is an excuse for not determining the right value / heuristic in
the first place.

yup.
