Hi,
Does the kernel load internal built in modules (obj-y) in a certain 
order, or in a random order? Does the kernel internal module loading 
based on a configuration file?
I am running an ARM system, is there a way to delay the Ethernet module 
loading until some other internal modules are loaded?
Thank you.
Jim
