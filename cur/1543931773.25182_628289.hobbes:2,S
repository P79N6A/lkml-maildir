Oh. My. God.
Michael. I have a degree in Physics. I placed sixth in the world
finals of the ACM Collegiate programming contest in 1999, Cal Poly
Team Gold. ( 
http://icpc.baylor.edu/past/icpc99/Finals/Tour/Win/Win.html
, I'm the guy all the way to the right. ) I ported the 2.4 kernel to a
custom ppc platform, including writing drivers for various hardware on
it ( 
http://patinc.com
 ). I'm the guy who did all the software for a
linux-based Voice over IP call center (
http://broncocommunications.com/
 ).
So, *now* do you believe I'm not an idiot?
To answer your question, it requests the rfkill-input module. But
under the version I'm trying, rfkill-input is not automatically
loaded. I've pointed to the mailing list URL that proves that. So, I
loaded rfkill and rfkill-input by hand. Perhaps rfkill wasn't
necessary, I don't know, and I don't care. But once I did that, *then
and only then* did your damn b43 driver start printing out any
messages to dmesg at all, which then let me download the latest
firmware, and continue moving forward.

I'm saying the patch you signed off on has a side-effect that will fix
my issue. And even if I *were* saying that, the most you should take
from it is that you are human and sometimes may make mistakes, just
like the rest of us. There's nothing challenging in that statement.
I've provided the bug report as many ways as I can think to. If you
don't agree, then I guess you'll just have to get the bug report from
someone else who can figure out exactly how to sugar coat the message
so that you'll listen to it.
Me, I'm done.
