Hi,
I should have specified that I work on a SoC, which does not follow
strict rules like PCI devices.
From a hardware designer point of view, this is a "good" design
especially for this kind of device. (DVB Conditionnal Access Slave
Shared Memory)
If the code was in the kernel space, we could do some processing in irq
mode like other devices of the SoC.
Thanks for your time and comments, I will see the irqcontrol solution as
an alternative.
Just forget my patch since it's only applicable to very specific devices.
Neil
