    Interesting. So cmd->device->host changed after ide_do_drive_cmd?
It is a race.
ide_do_drive_cmd(..., ide_end) does not wait for I/O to finish,
but when I/O finishes cmd is freed. So, if the device is quick
and the kernel is slow - maybe a timer interrupt in between -
the command can have finished before the spin_lock_irq() is done.
    That may be a problem if the scsi error handler has to spring 
    into action for this command, as it uses that field extensively...

    So it is OK to rely on the NULL check in kfree?
Yes. Many years ago I regarded it as ugly to do so, but by now
it is common usage.
