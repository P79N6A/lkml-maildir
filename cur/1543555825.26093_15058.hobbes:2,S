But look at positive side:
1. really few people run development kernels despite the "performance" so 
	it probably will be with nondebug kernels.
2. production kernels get more solid
3. because there could be a lot more debug points in development kernels
4. Distributors are interested in shipping debug-kernels.
You see the part that lots of asserts and debug prints  may go.
I see the advantage, that  a lot of them can come, at no cost.
Besides, if you want to have some assert anyway, then do not write it with
system-wide macro but make your own or mark it as "included allways".
Faulty logic.
