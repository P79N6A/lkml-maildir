There is a chicken and egg problem with initrd on 2.6. When
root=/dev/xxx is passed to kernel, kernel will call try_name, which
uses /sys/block/drive/dev, to find out the device number for ROOT_DEV.
The problem is /sys/block/drive may not exist if the driver is loaded
by /linuxrc in initrd. As the result, /linuxrc can't use
/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev to determine the root device number.
