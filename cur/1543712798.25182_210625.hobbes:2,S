They would be fine. The key thing is that none of the filesystems which
have journals get mounted. That would cause the crash recovery routines
to run, resulting inconsistency between the image on disk and the one
that the suspend image contains. You could probably do just about
anything, so long as those filesystems aren't mounted. Assuming that is
done, actually calling suspend after an initrd is run shouldn't be a
problem, so far as I know.
Regards,
Nigel
