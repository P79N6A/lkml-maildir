Locked. And these boards don't even have the wide-spread "boot from USB even if
system boot up sequence states otherwise" bug. Probably just because they do
not support booting from USB, though.

Not locked, but that would be an option - others would notice it if you did
anything weird, however.

That's the only thing that might actually work - an inductive device wrapped
around the keyboard cable. But I've never seen those available ready to buy.

Not interesting. Well, once someone stole a mouse. A dirty old PS/2 mouse with
a ball. Who would steal such a mouse?

Right, especially since people would not mess with the hardware. If there are
20 students in a room, would you really do something strange? For example,
nobody even tries to watch porn in these rooms.

There might be a difference, yes - but there's also a difference in timing if
the system has background load. So nothing to rely upon. Plus we have CRTs that
just get black for some time with some clicking noise - and these CRTs need
quite a long time to start showing a picture after changing the video mode.

Yes, good idea, but we already are using it for soft reboot. If people start
using the idea of remapping backspace so others can't kill their screen saver
(and then keep logged on idle for days - a quite typical "DoS" here), the power
button will most probably be remapped from "shutdown -r now" to
"/etc/init.d/kdm restart". We usually don't want to kill some professor's pine
(ugh, they want us to install it) in that case, but rebooting would do that
too.
