And you load a patch into it by emailing to the bot, not via the web
interface.  The web interface is just for a) reporting b) maintainance, i.e., 
closing out a patch that got applied in some altered form, or applied with no 
notification to the bot, or obsoleted.

Yes, very much yes.  This way it just looks like regular email to Linus - 
except for some hopefully useful bookkeeping gack prepended to the top of the 
mail by the bot - and doesn't change the way he works at all.
