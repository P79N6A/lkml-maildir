Yes.  "Global OF lock".

You are not _guaranteed_ it is multithreaded, and you don't
know it's threading model (or how to do thread synchronisation).

YOu don't need to *stop* the other CPUs, you just need to
prevent them from entering the client interface.  Put a lock
in front.

The in-OF tree uses a bit more memory, depending on implementation.
It's hard to tell though, it contains so much more than the
properties-only tree, perhaps you're right.

Okay -- so answer the second part of my concern please: if you keep
a copy, you need to keep both in sync -- that means every change
by the kernel has to be done twice, and you won't ever be told about
changes by the OF, so you have to get a full fresh copy every single
time you return from an OF client call that could have changed a
property.
