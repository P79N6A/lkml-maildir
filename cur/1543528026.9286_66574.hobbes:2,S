The setitimer supports two more types of timers: ITIMER_VIRTUAL and
ITIMER_PROF. They are special timers. Only ITIMER_REAL can be
reimplemented by Posix timers. The amount of code for that is negligible.
So there is no real reason to remove it.
Most of the code is shared anyway so there is no obvious gain.
