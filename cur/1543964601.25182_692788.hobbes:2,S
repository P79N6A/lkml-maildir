Oh. The last message I got was an enthusiatic report on the performance 
gains you saw by pinning the process after we looked at slub statistics 
that showed that the behavior of the tests was different from your 
expectations. I got messages here that indicate that this was a scsi 
testing program that you had under development. And yes we saw the remote 
freeing degradations there.

If this is a stand in for the TPC then why did you not point that 
out when Pekka and I recently asked you to retest some configurations?
