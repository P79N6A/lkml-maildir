Vasily, this is still not against the CFQ branch, I get tons of rejects:
axboe@nelson:/src/linux-2.6-block $ patch -p1 --dry-run < ~/foo
[...]
10 out of 27 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file

If you don't want to use the git tree, then just grab
http://brick.kernel.dk/snaps/cfq-update-20070424
and apply it to 2.6.21-rc7-gitX (latest) and provide a diff against
that. Thanks!
