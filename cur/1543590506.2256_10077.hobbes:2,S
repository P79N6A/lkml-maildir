Bruce,
According to Intel's driver for Pro/1000, it supports checksum on Rx via
module option "XsunRX=1".  I have not tried this yet because we are
waiting on our Gbps switch hardware.

Yes, hopefully we will be running the new setup (64 clients, many Gbps
adapters) in about 2-3 weeks.  At that point I'd like to get some
results for 8-way as well.  It would definitely be a good idea to
compare results.
