   Concur, all round. However, we've now had 'vfork() == fork()' being
   generally advertised for some time. I know programmers, therefore
   (many of whom I'd not care to share an office with, but that's
   another thing entirely) who reflexively have used vfork() everywhere
   'because it's the same as fork, but might be better than fork one
   day'.
Agreed, but that's silly.  If was going "to be better than fork one
day", it would do so by assuming the old BSD semantics (and that does
have some slight performance penefits even with COW).
However, if they use vfork() like fork() in some situation where BSD 4.3
vfork() would break, on the vague assumption that vfork() will change in
some way that's better-but-without-any-of-the-limitations-of-old-vfork,
they're just being stupid, and they deserve everything they get.
   Post _big_ warnings. Some things will break. Things that should have been
   written differently to begin with, mind you.
Sigh.... too bad we can't give programmers electric shocks each time
they pull such wild leaps of illogic.
