Well, I got the opposite experience (for now). test9 caused me several
lockups during same kind of load, even CD-R burning (dual BP6, IDE). I
usually refrain from reporting lockups because of the crappy hardware
I'm using but lately I have been seeing an increasing number of
lockups.
I switched to test10pre4 this morning to see if it makes a difference.
