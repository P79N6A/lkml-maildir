Thanks, you've already done it! I assumed that when I didn't see any
problems while the ping was running that it was just bad timing, and the
problem didn't happen while I was looking. Your note that the pinging
actually prevents the problem gives me something new to investigate.

I someone can suggest "what to do" I'll do it as well. At the moment I'm
building a table of 2.5.59 client against 2.4.19, AIX, BSD, etc, and vice
versa. I am looking for hangs with and without the ping running, in hopes
that the results will be useful, possibly to me but more likely to someone
who can see what's happening.
For the record, I see severe hangs with 2.4.19 server and 2.5.59 client,
I'll know what effect the ping has in a few minutes.
