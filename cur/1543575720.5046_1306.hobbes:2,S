Subject: ramdisk on P3 vs Celeron failure!

Boot up using:
        Loadlin-1.6a
        Win98
        ramdisk_size=18000
        initrd=ram.gz (this is the gzip'ed root filesystem)
Kernel 2.2.x (up to 2.2.18)
- on P3 and Celeron
        ram.gz must be <3862544 bytes
Kernel 2.4.x (up to 2.4.0-test12)
- on Celeron
        ram.gz must be <3862544 bytes
- on P3
        ram.gz has no such limit!!!
Failure I got was ...
        System Halted
        Less than 4MB!
Same ram.gz and bzimage tested on P3 and Celeron.
