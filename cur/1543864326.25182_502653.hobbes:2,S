Ok, I'm personally heading to bed, but it rally should be as simple as
 - get the git tree in the first place
 - do
	git bisect good v2.6.19
	git bisect bad v2.6.20-rc2
	.. it will pick a point for you to try ..
	.. compile, boot, test ..
	"git bisect {good|bad}" depending on results
 - until (found)
(Of course, you should check that -rc2 really is bad to make sure. I think 
that's what Uwe reported, though. And I don't think we've done anything 
after -rc2 that could impact this, so I don't doubt it).
