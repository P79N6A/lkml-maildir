I think it's because, as you observed, grab_super() is static and
hence not reachable from container.c. But I thought that the only side
effect of it that we needed (since we had a safe pointer to the
superblock not obtained via the superblock list) was the increment of
sb_active. (As it turns out I was wrong and we needed the s_umount
lock too).
Incrementing the sb_active count (if simple_set_mnt() failed) seemed
as though it would be wrong.

I don't quite remember why I did it this way originally, now. I've got
no objection to the code being cleaned up to fit the more common
approach if it's practical to do so, but it seems to me that your
current patch fix seems enough at least for now.
Thanks,
Paul
