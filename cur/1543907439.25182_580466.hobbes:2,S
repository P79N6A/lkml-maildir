Thanks for all your reports!
Unfortunately I was NOT successful in trying to get it to work here.
The EPOX 8K5A2+ probably(?) is a KT333 chipset (or KT333A?),
and thus possibly the first one to sport a HPET is KT400 (plus its
correspondingly modern VT8235 companion chip) or even more modern chipsets.
Here is my hexdump analysis, and unfortunately I was unable to
get any bit to enable the HPET range.
I didn't want to get too brave, since this is obviously also
rather dangerous... (I adhered to the specs rather closely without
trying too many exciting things)

0x91 bit 4 is interesting, but writing e.g. 1f still keeps 4a there for me
0x92 bit 6 is interesting, but...
0x94 bit 4 is interesting. can be changed, but HPET still cannot be enabled
0x99 bit 6 is interesting, but changing doesn't work

== hmm, 0xf6 bit 4/1 or 0xfc bit 0? ==
0xf6 is not modifiable, but 0xfc is, but HPET still cannot be enabled
Oh, my i815E P3 notebook (== ICH2, 8086:244c) does NOT allow me
to enable HPET either, the corresponding bit (on 0xD2, IIRC)
does not stick (since ICH3 is said to be the first chipset to enjoy
force-enable support, and I wanted to verify this).
About SiS support... SiS 964 is said to contain HPET support,
so possibly 963, 962, ... secretly have it, too?
Some of those might need some force-enabling as well...
I don't have any such machines, though, only a rotten SiS 735 board ;)
(the well-known K7S5A).
