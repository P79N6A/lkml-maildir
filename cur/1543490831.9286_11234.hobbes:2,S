  ...
  Hardware pending troubles:
	  The external cabinet has room for 9 disks. The 10th disk was
	  installed into the main processor box.
	  All disks were linked together using eXtremeRaid 1100 channel 1.
	  Unable to prepare the System disks from the 2 5 disks packs.
	  We got all the time: disk nn goes offline
	  We linked the 9 external disks to the eXtemeRaid 1100 using
	  channel 2 meanwhile we keep the internal disk on channel 1
	  Channel 3 is free.
Which model disk drives are you using in this configuration?  Did you check
Mylex's disk drive compatibility list at:
	
ftp://ftp.mylex.com/pub/dac960/diskcomp.html
When drives go offline spontaneously, it is usually due to either electrical
problems with the SCSI configuration or compatibility problems with the disk
drive firmware.  Qualifying disk models and firmware versions for use with high
performance RAID controllers is not a trivial exercise.
