I recall there being arguments before about when to add initializations.
Unfortunately I can't remember the content of those arguments.  But I
thought that on the gcc-haters side the complaint was exactly that gcc
was emitting warnings in cases where it could never hope to determine
whether an initialization is required.  Am I misremembering?

That said, I'm OK with the extra initialization.  Might be worth a
comment, though, just to avoid giving the wrong impression about the
assumptions here; something like:
--b.
