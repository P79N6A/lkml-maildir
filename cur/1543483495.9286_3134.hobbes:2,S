On power up opl3 isn't loaded even though it is listed in conf.modules
I have to use insmod to load it
If I try to use the generic one it doesn't want to load
I get unresolved symbol opl3_detect_R67481767
I get unresolved symbol opl3_init_R9334a7fc
when I do inmod adlib_card io=0x388
ppp_deflate doesn't always load, when it doesn't
I get the following in /var/log/messages
Can't locate module ppp-compress-21
Can't locate module ppp-compress-26
Can't locate module ppp-compress-24
I can load it with insmod ppp_deflate
Please note that I am not currently on the mail list.
