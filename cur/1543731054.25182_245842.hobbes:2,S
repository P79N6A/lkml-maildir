Hi...
Because I was  a bit surprise that my problem was just with one easy
line in the driver, I did more investigations about this problem. 
With the two versions of the driver, it's the same PHY component which
is used by the driver. But, if the PHY type is marked as UNKNOWN, 
the driver send this command to it :
(from drivers/net/sis900 in sis900_default_phy() function)
mdio_write(net_dev, phy->phy_addr, MII_CONTROL,
				status | MII_CNTL_AUTO |MII_CNTL_ISOLATE);
According to the PHY documentation (which can be found at the following
page : 
http://www.national.com/pf/DP/DP83847.html
), it sets the PHY in
auto-negotiation mode (which is quite normal) and in Isolate mode (which
I don't understand why) :
"When in the MII isolate mode, the DP83847 does not respond to packet
data present at TXD[3:0], TX_EN, and TX_ER inputs and presents a high
impedance on the TX_CLK, RX_CLK, RX_DV, RX_ER, RXD[3:0], COL, and CRS
outputs. The DP83847 will continue to respond to all management
transactions.
While in Isolate mode the TD+- outputs will not transmit packet data but
will continue to source 100BASE-TX scrambled idles or 10BASE-T normal
link pulses" 
Could someone give me a hint about this setting ?
