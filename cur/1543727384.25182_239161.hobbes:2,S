Subject: [PATCH] VFS readahead bug in 2.6.8-rc[1-3]

Hi,
There is a readahead bug in do_generic_mapping_read (filemap.c).  This
bug appears to have been introduced in 2.6.8-rc1.  Specifically the bug
is caused by an incorrect code change which causes VFS to call
readpage() for indexes beyond the end of files where the file length is
zero or a 4k multiple.
In Squashfs this causes a variety of almost immediate OOPes because
Squashfs trusts the VFS not to pass invalid index values.  For other
filesystems it may also be causing subtle bugs.  I have received
prune_dcache oopes similar to Gene Heskett's (which was also
pointer corruption), and so it may fix this and other reported
readahead bugs.
The patch is against 2.6.8-rc3.
Regards
Phillip Lougher
