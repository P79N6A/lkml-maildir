"The" same spot?  Wouldn't that be the same *two* spots, presumably with a
seek involved?  *That* would induce a 50 Hz vibration which could be
nasty.  But just writing to one sector 50 times a second should be an
absolute fiesta of...rotational latency.  Doldrum city.  Silence and
stillness, at least from the head mechanism...

Now, 129,600,000 round trips between the end of the log file and the
log file inode could cause a bit of wear...
