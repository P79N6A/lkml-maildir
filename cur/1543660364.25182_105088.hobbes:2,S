    I'm the guilty one for (1) and (2). These problems are coming from the
    3c509 removal from Space.c.
    I'll cook a patch latter today...
I forgot to mention the conclusion of (3): inserting code
in the Boomerang driver to print ethN and MAC address
made immediately clear what happened: eth0 and eth1 had
been interchanged.
