I'm in the process of cleaning up various headers for use from  
userspace, and at the same time I'm working to clean up some of the  
duplication in the kernel-only portions of those headers.  I'm  
running into one oddity that I can't explain.  In the various asm-*/ 
termios.h files, there are user_termio_to_kernel_termios functions.   
The m68k header does this:
get_user((termios)->c_line, &(termio)->c_line);
The i386 header is missing that line, and after macro expansion the  
rest of the context is almost exactly identical.  It appears there  
are a couple other architectures that fall on both sides of the  
fence.  Can anyone explain this apparently aberrant behavior or is  
this a bug?  If there's a reason behind it, I'll make sure to put in  
a useful comment; otherwise I'll fix it.
Thanks for the help!
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
