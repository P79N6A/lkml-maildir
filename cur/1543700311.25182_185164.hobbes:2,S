Ok, I'll gladly make that change, but I still need a handle on the
sdev_gendev.kobj in order to make the symlink:
>  			rc = sysfs_create_link(&edev->kobj,

While there's an accessor function to_scsi_device() to go from the
struct device to the struct scsi_device, there's not accessor to go from the
scsi_device to the struct device, which would further abstract
struct internals.  Can I get such added to a SCSI header file?
Something like:
static inline struct device *
sdev_to_gendev(struct scsi_device *sdev)
{
    return &sdev->sdev_gendev;
}
Thanks,
Matt
