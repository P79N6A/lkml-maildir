Hi list,
Sorry to ask this ,
I had compiled the source to binary , but when I make it release
,means that I copy it to /boot and add it to lilo boot image, my
machine fails to boot
the error is:
    Cannot find root on 307
(the boot = /dev/hda7 on lilo.con is corrected , because I'm using
that configuration with 2.2.13)
So how can I go through this?
Thanks
Nguyen Binh
