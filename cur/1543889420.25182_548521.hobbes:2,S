Note that /proc/acpi is going away in the long term.
The ideal is that things that are implemented via ACPI
should instead appear as generic features under sysfs
when possible.
There will still be some ACPI-specific things stuffed
into /sys/firmware/acpi -- but not the kind of useful-
to-the-user stuff that you are looking for.

And this is a systematic bug in the ACPI code.
The "name" should _never_ be exposed to user-space.
Eg. all the names under, say /proc/acpi/*/*
are arbitrary strings created by the BIOS programmer.
They are meaningless to the user, except that they
are unique.  To answer your question, there is no limit
to instances of ACPI objects, such as the number of thermal zones.
