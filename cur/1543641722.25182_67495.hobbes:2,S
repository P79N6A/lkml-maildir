To access files on the server share, the client must send authentication 
tockens. This should be send by the daemon and must be get from a file 
on the disk that each user shuold have (the kerberos ticket got by PAM). 
If no file (or invalid one) is available, then it should be accessed as 
guest.

The user will already been logged on ONE domain controller.

I don't understand why a per-user directory tree should be needed. A 
per-machine tree should be enough.
This doesn't answer my question:
How do I communicate between a kernel driver and a userspace program?
What is the best method in terms of:
- simplicity (first implementation)
- efficacity (second implementation, performance oriented)
Is it viy UNIX sockets?
Is it ioctls?
Or shared memory?
Thanks.
