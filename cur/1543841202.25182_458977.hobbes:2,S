Subject: [PATCH 0/6] kill __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__, try #3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This should address all comments I got for the second version.
Since there is no common agreement on what should happen to
the _syscallX macros, I'm not touching them at all this time.
Whoever wants to remove, reenable or replace them, should send
a separate set of patches for these. With my patches, these
macros are not used in the kernel, and not useable from user
space, so we should probably do _something_ about them.
