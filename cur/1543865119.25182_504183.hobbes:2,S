Wrong! These checks can and do occur well after the time of I/O
submission in the case of remote filesystems with asynchronous writeback
support.
Consider, for instance, the cases where the server reboots and loses all
state. Then there is the case of failover and/or migration events, where
the entire filesystem gets moved from one server to another, and again
you may have to recover state, etc...

The problem with this is that the security context is getting
progressively more heavy as we add more and more features. In addition
to the original uid/gid/fsuid/fsgid/groups, we now have stuff like
keyrings to carry around. Then there is all the context needed to
support selinux,...
In the end, you end up recreating most of struct task_struct...
