Essentially all commonly used English words which start out with hyphens
loose them over time.  It starts out with typos and progresses until the
non-hyphenated form becomes the exclusively used form.  It does seem that
re-enable → reenable is occurring, based on those search hits.
Andi> Similar with upto.
I’ve a *much* harder time agreeing with «upto» in place of «up to».
That should be treated as a typo in need of fixing.
