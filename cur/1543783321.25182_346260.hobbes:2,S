Again, on-disk is fixed little endian, so we have for example:
#define gfs2_32_to_cpu le32_to_cpu
#define cpu_to_gfs2_32 cpu_to_le32
To _test_ and _verify_ the endian-handling of the code we can
#define GFS2_ENDIAN_BIG which switches the above to:
#define gfs2_32_to_cpu to be32_to_cpu
#define cpu_to_gfs2_32 to cpu_to_be32
We offered to removed this when I explained it before.  It sounds like it
would give you some comfort so I'll just go ahead and do it barring any
pleas otherwise.
