Unfortunately the ping replies come in on both interfaces, as well as 
any other traffic (like ssh or web traffic). Everything works but the 
load of the system caused by network traffic is nearly doubled this way 
and may cause confusion in a number of applications. 
Would there be a way to stop the non-active slave(s) from "listening", 
i.e. drop all traffic received by them? If yes, where could I do that?
