no one could really offer any help in the end.  i think having the
multiple snat rules matching on all interfaces may have been
triggering a race in the conntrack code.  i should probably resubmit
my findings.
anyway, limitting the rules by matching them only to their appropriate
interfaces seemed to alleviate the problem.
so now i use something similar to this:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 192.168.1.0/24 \
-j SNAT --to 10.1.1.15
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -s 192.168.1.0/24 \
-j SNAT --to 192.168.1.1
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -s 192.168.2.0/24 \
-j SNAT --to 192.168.2.1
---
note the -o interface rules.  this keeps it from applying more than
one snat rule to a packet.  it only applies them to the packet going
out the proper interface.
ps. i'm actually going to bounce this to the kernel list again to see
if i can stir up any more noise on this one.
