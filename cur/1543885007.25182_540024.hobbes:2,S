You can't do that once you define your own layout, or you introduce a
nasty intermodule dependency which shouldn't exist.
The rule should be:
- You MUST NOT reload segments before LGDT.
  (One can possibly get away with declaring that DS = CS+8 by
  protocol and load dynamic values, but that's not a good thing.)
- After LGDT, you MUST load your own segment values.
Anything else is just broken.
