Yep, bugger the network stack, I write to the NIC registers directly
and grab the interrupts too. I use a dedicated NIC and network for all
my distributed applications. Nothing beats fondling the bare metal!!!
I use RT-Linux too to squeeze out the last drop of performance: I'm
aiming for sub-microsecond interrupt latency!
I'm looking at designing my own NICs and network technology to
increase bandwidth and decrease latency. I'm on a mission!

Look, I have an API for message passing between remote nodes and I use
that in my distributed applications. I also have an API for threading
and I use that in my threaded applications. And when I have a threaded
and distributed application, I use both APIs. So I don't have anything
against APIs which make life easier for the programmer. I've spent
years developing these APIs and others and I use them all the time.
My fundamental point, though, is that an API should provide a sensible
abstraction of the underlying hardware. A threading/SHM API for a
distributed machine is the wrong abstraction, because performance will
suck.
A message passing API for an SMP machine is the wrong abstraction,
because it also prevents you making best use of the machine (although
it's not as foolish as threading/SHM for a distributed machine).
APIs are fine, just use the right one for the job. And in the world of
parallel processing, there are two very different kinds of hardware:
SMP and message passing. So use two APIs: threads and message passing.
What I object to is this idea that you can produce a single, unified
abstraction solve all problems. It just doesn't work this way.
