That's pretty good news.
Also, I tangent and mention that I have been won over WRT OSL:  with its 
more tight "lawyerspeak" and mutual patent defense clauses, I consider 
OSL to be a "better GPL" license.
I would in fact love to see the Linux kernel relicensed under OSL.  I 
think that would close some "holes" that exist with the GPL, and give us 
a better legal standing.  But relicensing the kernel would be huge 
political undertaking, and I sure as hell don't have the energy, even if 
it possible.  No idea if Linus, Alan, Andrew, or any of the other major 
contributors would go for it, either.
