And 5.1.2.3 states:
       [#2]  Accessing  a  volatile  object,  modifying  an object,
       modifying a file, or calling a function  that  does  any  of
       those  operations are all side effects,11) which are changes
       in the state of the execution environment.  Evaluation of an
       expression  may  produce side effects.  At certain specified
       points in the execution sequence called sequence points, all
       side  effects  of previous evaluations shall be complete and
       no side effects of subsequent evaluations shall  have  taken
       place.   (A summary of the sequence points is given in annex
       C.)
So it seems to be obvious ;-) that the compiler must not remove
seemingly unnecessary references to volatile objects.
