Subject: [PATCH] struct file leakage

Hello!
Andrew, this is a patch from Alexey Kuznetsov for 2.6.16.
I believe 2.6.17 still has this leak.
-------------------------------------------------------------
2.6.16 leaks like hell. While testing, I found massive leakage
(reproduced in openvz) in:
*filp
*size-4096
And 1 object leaks in
*size-32
*size-64
*size-128
It is the fix for the first one. filp leaks in the bowels
of namei.c.
Seems, size-4096 is file table leaking in expand_fdtables.
I have no idea what are the rest and why they show only
accompaniing another leaks. Some debugging structs?
