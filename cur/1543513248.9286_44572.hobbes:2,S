It gets worse I think.
Tyan used to have a page[1] which stated that 440fx was broken in respect
to ECC memory handling. The statement was:
"0.6 ECC Memory Compatibility
  At this time, the HX, TX, VX, and FX Intel Chipsets do not yet support 
true ECC memory, however, when running Parity Memory with ECC Enabled in
the BIOS, the Intel chipset will emulate ECC. Future products will
support true ECC."
The page is no longer there. Anyone know where its gone to?
The 440fx does have some other design flaws regarding the memory
controller but all BIOS I have seen so far appear to compensate properly
according to the workarounds in the Intel errata sheets.
