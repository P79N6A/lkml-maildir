Please elaborate. I always thought that 3 host bridges (controllers,
hoses and so on) mean 3 physically separated PCI buses. In this
case the approach with only one root bus structure is plain wrong -
resource allocation won't work correctly.
You should have 3 root buses, and apply suggested workaround to all 3.
Or am I missing something?

I still hope you won't :-)

I think 4th slot makes no sense in terms of the PCI bus and
should be killed. I guess that initially it was intended for cardbus
drivers (for 2nd IO window), but it seems that they don't use
pci_bus->resource pointers at all.

This can be easily done with generic quirks:
	{ PCI_FIXUP_HEADER, PCI_VENDOR_ID_XXX, PCI_DEVICE_ID_BAD_BRIDGE,
	  quirk_transparent_bridge }
...
static void __init
quirk_transparent_bridge(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
	dev->class |= 1;
}
