Also, the "mem=" trick apparently works only for shared-memory
regions of less than 4 MBytes (on Intel)---the RT-Linux list
archive has details.  bigphysarea works for arbitrarily large
regions.  The same user-space code works; you just need to get
it the right starting (physical) address when using bigphysarea.
Finally, if you happen to use an initial ramdisk, it turns
out that bigphysarea will likely conflict with where lilo
decides to load it.  The syslinux bootloader avoids this
problem by using high memory for the initial ramdisk.
If you don't use initrd, though, there is no issue.
