Yep, that would be a good option, thanks Alan.
You can look through the tree at how drivers remap their rvmalloced
memory -- (here's a snippet from drivers/media/video/meye.c):
while (size > 0) {
     page = vmalloc_to_pfn((void *)pos);
     if (remap_pfn_range(vma, start, page, PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_SHARED)) {
         mutex_unlock(&meye.lock);
         return -EAGAIN;
     }
     start += PAGE_SIZE;
     pos += PAGE_SIZE;
     if (size > PAGE_SIZE)
         size -= PAGE_SIZE;
     else
         size = 0;
}
The trick is to get the underlying pfns and remap one at a time.
You could also tinker with vmalloc_to_page+vm_insert_page, although
that might not yet be the best option for an out of tree driver.
