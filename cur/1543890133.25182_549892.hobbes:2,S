Hi,
I found a bug on CPU hotplug. If oprofile is running, CPU hot remove causes
system hang. I only confirm that this problem occurs on my ia64 box. I'm glad
if someone report about other arch.
How to reproduce
================
1) start oprofile
  # opcontrol --start
2) offline a CPU.
  # echo 0 >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online 
Expected Result
===============
Succeed to remove CPU
Actual Result
=============
See the following console log.
  # opcontrol --start
  Detected stale lock file. Removing.
  Using 2.6+ OProfile kernel interface.
