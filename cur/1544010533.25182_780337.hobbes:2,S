Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: remove dead BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY definition
The block layer dropped the virtual merge feature
(b8b3e16cfe6435d961f6aaebcfd52a1ff2a988c5). BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY
definition is meaningless now (For POWER, BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY has been
meaningless for a long time since POWER disables the virtual merge
feature).
