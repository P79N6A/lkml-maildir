Not everyone wants/needs that.  Flexibility is key.

Depends.  The kernel _can_ shut down OF; in that case, it
becomes responsible for passing the device tree along to
the kexec'd kernel.

Heh :-)

Oh you *do* cross a border, and that is a good thing here; it
is a stable API, and that makes a lot of sense here.

Yes.

The PowerPC arch code already handles this.
