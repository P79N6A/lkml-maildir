Well, it seems to work fine during the suspend phase, at least, and it also
seems to work well during normal use:
fugl:~# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online 
fugl:~# echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online 
FWIW, there is an error in dmesg afterwards, though:

No idea whether it's related. FWIW, resume didn't work with maxcpus=1 on boot
either, so I'm not really sure how related it is.
