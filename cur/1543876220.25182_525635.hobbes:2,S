I will have to dig a little deeper but this certainly sounds like the
x86_64 relocatable kernel patches.  I believe the check is in 
arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/misc.c
I think the interesting .config variable is going to be
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START.
I suspect that isn't going to be 2M aligned, like the kernel requires
for best performance.
