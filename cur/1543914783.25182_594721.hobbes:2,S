Maybe.  It's hard to tell because you have not provided enough
information.  To get a better idea of what's going on you should enable 
CONFIG_USB_DEBUG, for both 2.6.22 and 2.6.23, and then post the dmesg 
logs.  It wouldn't hurt to enable CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME also.
These sorts of errors can occur because of bad cable connections or
other similar hardware problems.  There's an excellent chance they have
no connection to the kernel version.
