Thank you.  I appreciate it.
Having the physical addresses there makes writing a sane bootloader
simpler. 
Alpha practically does this except there is a fixed virtual offset added to
everything.
In general anything that gives us correct physical addresses makes
like much simpler on the bootloader..
