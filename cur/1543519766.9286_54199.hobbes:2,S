There was a user-space pthreads implementation from MIT, and some
people were playing with it about 3 years ago. I took one look at it
and curled up my nose (once I realised it was user-space only) and
discarded it.
Around the same time, LinuxThreads from Xavier was available, and used
clone(2).  Unfortunately, it was still a bit raw, so I ended up using
clone(2) directly. A few months later LinuxThreads was in pretty good
shape. I'm still using clone(2) directly, though, because:
- I'm too lazy to switch (even though it's just a matter of removing
  #ifdef LINUX_CLONE and falling back to pthreads)
- pthreads have extra overheads that I don't feel compelled to absorb.
