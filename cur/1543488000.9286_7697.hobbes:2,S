Does anybody know if the new SGI Workstations that are based upon the
Intel processors work with Linux? I'm assuming that the basic hardware
will work fine but because of the proprietary video it won't do X. If this
is true does anybody know the timeframes we're talking about before Linux
is supported?
Thanks,
Chris

putting on your armor because you were "just going around the corner."
