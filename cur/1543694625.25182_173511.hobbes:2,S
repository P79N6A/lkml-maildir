Hi!
Some more changes landed in -test8. I have not seen them
before. Patrick, please, if you change something, can you post patch
somewhere for review before merging with Linus?

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Notice lgdt here. You have moved setup of segment registers before
loading gdt. This is actually okay, if you can be sure that all such
registers are in gdt (and not in ldt, for example).
Now, if you are sure this is okay (there is another load of gdt in
real mode), you can kill this lgdt, too, and  kill the comment below.

What are these outl-s? I do not see %ax being initialized... Some kind
of debugging hack? If you are trying to emulate delays, those are not
needed, what you killed were debugging hacks.
You no longer save %eax, %ecx, %edx, %esp, %ebp, %edi, %esi. This
means you probably need to add asmlinkage somewhere...
