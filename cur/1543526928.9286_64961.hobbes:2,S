You need to use threads if you want to take advantage of SMP, but
there's no reason you need one thread per socket --- you can just
load-balance a small number of threads, passing each accepted fd to the
least-loaded thread.
It's still a hack, of course, but until we have properly working shared
signal queues it's the best we can do.
