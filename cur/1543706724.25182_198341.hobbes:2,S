Depends on how to handle those undecodeble file names. non-ascii filenames are
probably a security issue (negative characters) with some apps. Making them inaccessible
is definitely not ok. I proposed one version, although it might be a good idea to look at those file
systems that handle the problem already so a uniform solution could be used that makes all filenames
accessible regardless of which characters are used and doesn't cause unneccessary
confusion as to what is the name.
