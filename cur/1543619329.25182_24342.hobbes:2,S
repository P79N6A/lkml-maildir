Zwane Mwaikambo ask me to post to kernel list directly, so here it is.
I have Voodoo 3 3000 PCI on dual pentium 200MHz (MMX) so no MTRR here
and I see occasionally font corruption with every Xfree 4.x (excluding
4.2, because don't have it yet). I use only text console. Typically one
or sometimes more characters are corrupted and look like upper/lower
fragment is eaten. Always switch to X and back correct it.
Best regards,
Marek Kassur.
