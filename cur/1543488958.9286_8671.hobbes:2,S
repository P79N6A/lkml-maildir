As I said benchmark it.
Right now stat() returns the superblock s_blocksize field and that is used
by the higher layers to govern the I/O writing size. If you change this
to a low value you trash your entire performance, especially versus non
Linux NFS servers.
To get the right effect you need to decouple the stat() returns and the
a.out file check.
