Can you detail how you came up with this diagnosis?

Can you please try 2.6.14-git1 and 2.6.14-rc5-mm1? This should help us
norrow the faulty patch. Also, please confirm that 2.6.14-git7 still has
the problem.

Enable as many debugging as possible, in particular I2C Core debugging
(I2C_DEBUG_CORE=y) in a working kernel and a non-working kernel, and
send both logs for comparison.
Thanks a lot for testing, BTW.
