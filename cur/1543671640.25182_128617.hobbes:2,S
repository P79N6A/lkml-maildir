Well, it (platform_data) predates the parisc conversion to the dma_
API.  I just assumed that was what it was there fore.  I had to do it
this way because parisc has a rather nasty set up in that there are
usually two PCI (and several other busses) which connect to two
different IO-MMUs.  I use the platform_data field to cache the
particular IO-MMU the device is connected to.  I assume this is the same
in alpha?
Previously parisc was using the sysdata field of the pci_dev (and
constructing fake pci_devs for other busses).  The conversion wasn't
actually that complex (although it was made easier on parisc because the
IO-MMU lives above the PCI busses, so in the generic device model we can
simply now traverse parents to find it).
