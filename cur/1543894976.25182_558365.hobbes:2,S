Again, why?  In the absence of a version number, why wouldn't the
redistributor choose any one he liked?

Yes.  The initial recipient knows that, because he received the
announcement by e-mail, where the "released under GPL" was.  But how
about downstream recipients?  (yeah, I'm filling in blanks and making
this up on the fly, I hope you don't mind)

How can the downstream recipient tell this case from the case in which
you attached one specific version of the license and didn't write
anywhere that only that version applied?

License file there by mistake is a possibility, but this wouldn't make
the program public domain, it would rather turn actions controlled by
copyright law into copyright infringement, but as long as the
recipient acted within the unclear intent of the licensor, the
licensor probably wouldn't enforce the license anyway.  And then, if
he did, there'd be a number of defenses available for the
licensee/infringer.  But IANAL.

We'll see if that works when someone tries to takes advantage of any
of the holes in GPLv1 that GPLv2 plugged and you try to enforce
GPLv2.  I'm not sure whether to hope it will (such that this implied
v2 gets better freedom protection than v1) or won't (such that I could
redistribute under v3 ;-)

I hope you've consulted a lawyer about this.  If not, it might be
safer to state your intentions more explicitly, like Linus did.

Works for me ;-)
