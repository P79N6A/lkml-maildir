Hmm.  I understand, but I now that I think about it a bit more, I think
I failed to notice the real problem:
The size of the readahead wouldn't matter if it actually prefetched the
data in advance.  It's not doing that right now.
What's happening with my MP3 streaming is:
1. read(4k) gets data after a delay.  xmms starts playing.
2. read(4k) gets some more data, right way, because readahead worked.
   xmms continues.
   ...
3. read(4k) blocks for a long time while readahead starts up again and
   reads a huge block of data.  read() then returns the 4k.  meanwhile,
   xmms has underrun.  xmms starts again.
4. goto 2.
It's really easy to see this behavior with the xmms-crossfade plugin and
a large buffer with "buffer debugging" display on.  With tcpdump in
another window, I can see that the readahead doesn't start prefetching
until it's right near the end of the data it fetched last, rather than
doing it in advance.  This is not obvious except in the case where
read() speed is limited by something like audio playback rates or heavy
processing times.

Well, my example with grep was assuming a CPU the speed of what I have
right now, not something modern. :)  "bzip2 -9" would likely apply these
days.

The link is not saturated, but it is used in huge bursts mixed with
periods of silence (where readahead is finished but has not yet started
the next block).

Yes, floppy in 2.5 has been broken for a while...
