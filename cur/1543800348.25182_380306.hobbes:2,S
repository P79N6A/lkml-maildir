Yeah, I thought about using the sem (or mutex ;) but remove_proc_entry is
used so darn much around the kernel, I wasn't sure it's not used in irq
context.  So I'm not sure I like the idea of making a non-scheduling
function schedule.  But it may not be a problem and it could very well be
ok to schedule here.
Also as Mitchell Blank pointed out, this list should probably be protected
everywhere by the same protection used, and an analysis should be done to
see what replacing the BKL affects.
