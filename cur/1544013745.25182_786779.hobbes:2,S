OK, but it's a bit fragile.
How are we to ensure that all calls to cpuset_can_attach() are followed
by a call to cpuset_attach(), and how are we to ensure that both calls
are protected by the same taking of the lock?  For all time?
In fact, it's broken right now, isn't it?  If cgroup_attach_task()'s
call to find_css_set() fails, we leak the result of cpuset_can_attach()'s
alloc_cpumask_var()?
