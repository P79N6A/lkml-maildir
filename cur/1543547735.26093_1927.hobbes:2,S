First of all, the "250,000" is wrong:
As of June 26, 2000
excess of 730,000 customers
grows at 200% per year
Second, dialup users don't have enough bandwidth to matter.
Bouncing SPAM across a 42 or 24 kb/s modem link is insignificant.

Tell me, would you like this done to you? You may assume typical
corporate enhancements: no PGP, filter runs on Windows 2000, any
unknown headers get stripped out, etc.
Don't suggest something you wouldn't like done to you.
