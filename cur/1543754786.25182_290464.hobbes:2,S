I'm not at all familiar with the code, though PaX uses more fine-grained
binary markings in PT_PAX_FLAGS (requires a patched binutils, though I
guess a PaX system could just nuke PT_GNU_STACK from .load and replace
it with PT_PAX_FLAGS).  *shrug*
. . . ok so I've hacked at PaX' source a few times for fun, but I forgot
everything I saw, I swear. :)
whatever, at this point I've lost interest, as I'm starting to wonder
where my next meal will come from.
