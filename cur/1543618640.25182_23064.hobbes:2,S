Thanks for the feedback.
2.5.2-dj5 wins the lucky "first-timer" award on the new tests.
Extract/configure/make/check autoconf-2.52:
Executes over 100000 processes and creates a lot of small
temporary files.  Won't hit the disk much on this box.
Extract/Configure/make/test perl-5.6.1:
For perl, "make test" is executed 5 times.  "make test" is about 
75% system and 25% user, which may provide more variation between 
kernel versions.

I'll time updatedb too.  updatedb may vary over time, depending
on how many src trees are extracted.  I'll make an effort to
keep that variable consistent.
