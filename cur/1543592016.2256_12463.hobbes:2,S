> They are entirely different. Too different sets of operations.
Maybe you didnt understand what I meant.
both bdev and cdev take care of the correspondence
device number <---> struct with operations.
The operations are different, but all bdev/cdev code is identical.
So the choice is between two uglies:
(i) have some not entirely trivial amount of code twice in the kernel
(ii) have a union at the point where the struct operations
is assigned.
I preferred the union.

Yes, but that was my design mistake in 1995.
I think you'll find if you continue on this way,
as I found and already wrote in kdev_t.h
that it is bad to carry pointers around for unopened and unknown devices.
So, I think that the setup must be changed a tiny little bit
and distinguish meaningless numbers from devices.
