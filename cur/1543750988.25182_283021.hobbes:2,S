How are PnP ISA devices handled?
Right solution for ISA devices is probably to create an ISA bus in
driver model, and hook such devices there....
Alternatively, you might just hang them onto platform bus, in similar
way i8042 uses...
Imagine this configuration:
cpu -- PCI #1 -- PCI to PCI bridge -- PCI #2 -- PCI to ISA bridge -- sound card #1 on 0x100
              \- PCI to PCI bridge -- PCI #3 -- PCI to ISA bridge -- sound card #2 on 0x100
...would you say that's supported? If yes you'd need to create ISA
buses and do it properly, otherwise hooking to platform bus is
probably acceptable.
