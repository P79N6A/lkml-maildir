But why if /dev/random depletes and you don't have any source of entropy 
? As you may have seen in my setup I had no mouse/keyboard attached to 
that server, and the only "things" capable of generate entropy where the 
two nics and the DAC960.
So I've enabled entropy only for the local nic and the DAC960 (at least 
"I think", for the dac :+) and now I'm plenty of entropy, but for a 
setup like this, the server may have been running without entropy at all 
for weeks (I've forgot to check the uptime :+P).
About this, think about php generating session_id()s without entropy 
(o_O), and stuff like that....
Salu2.
