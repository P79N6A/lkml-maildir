Okay, finally got to test sata_mv with kexec, perhaps this can shed
some light on the matter.
 * Normal boot
 * insmod sata_mv
 * all is okay, as expected
 * Did kexec    
 * insmod sata_mv
 * all is okay!
Good! It means that sata_mv doesn't mess things on its initialization 
sequence.
 * Normal boot
 * insmod sata_mv
 * all is okay, as expected
 * rmmod sata_mv
 * insmod sata_mv 
 * all is bad, as expected
 * kexec
 * insmod sata_mv
 * all is bad!
Conclusion: sata_mv's shutdown does something bad.
