Typo of mine: it is. The BSD people have noticed some time ago that the DAC
of the chipset apparently does bad things when the card is inserted in a
32 bits wide slot. 
Jon, if your ppc64 box offers 64 bits wide PCI slots, it would be nice if
you could ttry 2.6.9-rc2-bkX, apply
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/people/francois/misc/r8169-xx0.patch
and report the content of the "Config2" line in the logs of the kernel.
