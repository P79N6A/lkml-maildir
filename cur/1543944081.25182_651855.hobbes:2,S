Subject: [PATCH 4/3] Documentation: Remove references to FASTCALL/fastcall
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/11/423

An example function prototype and description of options that
modify how arguments are passed had references to fastcall.

Andrew, I don't have the knowledge to deal with the rcupdate.c
wrapper function, hopefully Paul will be able to have a look.
Also, the UML reference is to a config option UM_FASTCALL, not
the FASTCALL macro.
