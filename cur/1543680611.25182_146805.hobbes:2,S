  At the beginning I started calling the original quota format 'old' and
the new one 'v0' (because in the quota file there's written 0 in the
version  field ;)). If I did the decision now I would name it
differently...
  In the code on the other hand I started naming the formats v1 and v2
because internal type identifiers are '1' and '2'.
  So I agree that this is a bit messy but I'm not sure it's worth
renaming.
