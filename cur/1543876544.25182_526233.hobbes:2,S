Hi Marcel,
the specialized driver could hook on all reports of the device (as 
discussed a few mails ago in this thread) and have the possibility to do 
three different things with the obtained report:
- pass it back to generic hid driver for "standard" processing
- process the report, and issue input_event() itself
- pass it to hidraw and let userspace to consume it
This is going to work for the scenario you have described, right?
Thanks,
