Different people have reported this check triggered on various hardware
which doesn't have VIA686-anything.  In my case on both an old AcerNote
and a Toshiba-1800.

Ouch! Interesting to see that your system triggers the "VIA bug really
present.", whereas mine doesn't and I haven't found any gross time-keeping
problems.  Also, while we both report "read" and "re-read" values over a
narrow range they are quite different ranges.
I wonder if we are seeing different bugs which exhibit similar symptoms?

OK, just to set the record straight, my involvement has been merely to
port Vojtech's patch (for the original see:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100560251020988&w=2 ), add
the ''disable with "timer=no-via686a"'' bit (which people more
knowledgeable than I say is quite unnecessary) and to report some
"interesting" results (see:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102621884412934&w=2 ).
