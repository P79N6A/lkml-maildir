s/a index/index/
Along with Gautham's typo fix, you could also make this be passable
kernel-doc notation.  :)
See Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt for details.
Summary:
The function (or macro) name and short description must be on one line.
This is followed by the parameters, then a "blank" (actually " *") line,
then any (longer) description, notes, etc.  So basically:
/**
 * rcu_assign_index - assign (publicize) index of a newly initialized array element
 * @p: description of @p
 * @v: description of @v
 *
 * This function assigns (publicizes) the index of a newly
 * initialized array element that will be dereferenced by RCU
 * read-side critical sections.  Returns the value assigned.
 *
 * Inserts memory barriers on architectures that require them
 * (pretty much all of them other than x86), and also prevents
 * the compiler from reordering the code that initializes the
 * structure after the index assignment.  More importantly, this
 * call documents which indexes will be dereferenced by RCU read-side
 * code.
