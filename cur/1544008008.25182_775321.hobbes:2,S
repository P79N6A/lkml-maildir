This patch series are fixed and clean-up agasist
 "mm-of-the-moment snapshot 2008-11-30-22-35"
Picked up useful ones from recent linux-mm.
patches are numbered but I think each can be applied one by one independently.
[1/4] clean up move_tasks of memcg.
	(From Nikanth Karthikesan <knikanth@suse.de>)
	Obvious change.
[2/4] fixes mem+swap controller's limit check
	(From Daisuke Nishimura <nishimura@mxp.nes.nec.co.jp>)
	Maybe Ack from Balbir is appropriate.
[3/4] clean up gfp_mask passed to memcg.
	From me. I want a review by Hugh Dickins and Nick Piggin. please.
[4/4] fix the name of scan_global_lru().
	From me. Obvious change.
I'll queue Kosaki's memcg LRU fixes and cgroup-ID based on this.
Thanks,
