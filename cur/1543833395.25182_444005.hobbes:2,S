the script I use for that is at
http://www.fenrus.org/bt.sh
it tries to include things like rpm versions of the package it was in
etc, and suggests/downloads the right debuginfo rpms to improve the
backtrace. Clearly that's all userspace stuff; but it can run from a
daemon easily; eg have all core dumps go to a special directory where
the daemon reaps them and analyzes.
