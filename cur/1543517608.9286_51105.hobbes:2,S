1. Create a file, fill it up to size, mmap() it.  You can mmap() parts
   of a file to different addresses in the same process, and in that way
   you get page aliasing.  Only the pages you're thinking of aliasing
   need to be mapped.  Note that pages need to be flushed somehow on
   some non-x86 architectures (the CPU cache is by virtual address), but
   on x86 this is not required.
2. Create a shared memory block with shm*().  Use one for each page if
   necessary.
3. Contribute kernel code for shared anonymous mappings.
