Ok, 2.5.51 plus dm patches result in the following:
Initializing LVM: device-mapper: device
/dev/ide/host2/bus1/target0/lun0/disc too small for target
device-mapper: internal error adding target to table
device-mapper: destroying table
  device-mapper ioctl cmd 2 failed: Invalid argument
  Couldn't load device 'cheese_vg-blah'.
  0 logical volume(s) in volume group "cheese_vg" now active
lvm2.
Was fine (minus of course the entire bio thing) in 50, did something
break in 51 or is it just my box?
