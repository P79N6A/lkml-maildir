This appears to be a video driver running a card's video BIOS in vm86
mode and hitting one of many possible faults. The fault handler saves
a subset of the state to userspace with copy_to_user. This could
potentially cause a second fault and I don't see any guarantees that
this page is locked or anything.
So a) is this safe, somehow? And b) if so, what check can might_sleep use
to avoid false positives?
