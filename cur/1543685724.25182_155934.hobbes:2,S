I received the above email.
This read/modify the file attributes of filesystem specific via xattr
interface (in this case, ARCHIVE, SYSTEM, HIDDEN flags of fatfs).
Yes, also we can provide it via ioctl like ext2/ext3 does now.
But if those flags provides by xattr interfaces and via one namespace
prefix, I guess the app can save/restore easy without dependency of
one fs.
Which interface would we use for attributes of filesystem specific?
Also if we use xattr, what namepace prefix should be used?
Any idea?
Thanks.
