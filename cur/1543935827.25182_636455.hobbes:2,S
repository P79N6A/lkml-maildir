I think you and Zach are talking about different issues ;)
Eventfd born for two different reasons. First, to be able to have 
userspace to signal to a poll/select/epoll based listener an event. This 
can elso be done with pipes, but eventfd has a few advantages over pipes 
(3-4 times faster and *a lot* less memory footprint). Second, as a generic 
way for kernel subsystems to signal completions to a poll/select/epoll 
userspace listener. And this is what is used in the new KAIO eventfd 
feature (patch was like 5 lines IIRC).
This allow for KAIO events to be signaled to poll/select/epoll in a pretty 
easy way, using a simple extension of the AIO API.
What we talked originally with Ingo, when the first syslet code came up, 
was the ability to do the reverse thing. That is, host an epoll_wait() 
inside a syslet, and gather the completion using whatever the syslet code 
was/is going to use for it.
Given that 1) the eventfd completion patch was trivial and immediately 
available 2) the future of the whole syslet concept was/is still unclear, 
I believe it makes/made sense. If the syslets will become mainline, it'll 
mean that userspace will then be able to select the event-completion 
"hosting" method that better suits their needs. That are, either AIO 
completion hosted inside an epoll_wait() via an eventfd, or an 
epoll_wait() hosted inside a syslet.
