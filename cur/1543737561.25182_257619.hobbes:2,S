Subject: [PATCH] hvc_console fix to prevent oops and late hangup and write operations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
This patch prevents execution of hvc_write() and hvc_hangup() after the
tty layer has executed a final hvc_close() against a device.  This patch
provides a better method than was previously used.  tty->driver_data is
no longer invalidated so we'll no longer get oopses when the tty layer
allows late hangup() and write() operations.
changelog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
drivers/char/hvc_console.c
-Removed silly tty->driver_data = NULL; from hvc_close which prevents
possible oops in hvc_write() and hvc_hangup() due to improperly acting
ldisc close ordering.
-Added hp->count <= 0 check to hvc_write() and hvc_hangup() to prevent
execution of these function after hvc_close() has been invoked by the
tty layer.  Same tty ldisc issues as above are the reason.
-Added some comments to clarify the situation.
-Awaiting a forth coming patch from Alan Cox which should clean up the
close ordering and prevent the late hangup and write ops from happening.
Thanks,
