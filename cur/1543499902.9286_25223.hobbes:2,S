Hi !
We have the following 2 problems with NFS: ( Clients and Server running
Debian Linux 2.1 with kernel 2.2.6 )
Because I am not subscribed to the list please answer me directly.
1)   When a user edits a file on one client and then changes to another
client to edit the file again , it takes
        about 10-15 seconds until the second client recognizes that the
file has changed.
In such situations syslog reports:
kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 557269042 busy, i_count=2, i_nlink=1
kernel: nfs_free_dentries: found p5/spektrum.o, d_count=0, hashed=1
kernel: nfs_dentry_delete: p5/spektrum.o: ino=557269042, count=2,
nlink=1
2)  Sometimes we get in syslog:
kernel: nsm_mon_unmon: rpc failed, status=-13
kernel: lockd: failed to monitor  --------  Ip adress of NFS server
Has anyone similar problems, and what solutions do you suggest.
Would an upgrade to 2.2.10 help ?
Thanks in advance .
