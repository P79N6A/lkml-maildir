Or.. You could have multiple logging servers... The changes of both going
down are slim.. Infact, if you are sick enough you could perhaps setup
an alias interface with on each of them with the same IP and configure
firewalling to ignore everything on that interface except for syslog
traffic. Since syslog is UDP, this would probably work and keep the remote
servers from having to send n* packets for n computers.
