Enabling -pedantic spotted me at least immediately at the
bug in readv/writev fixed in the same series of kernel without
resorting to LSB testing as Alan explained how he came across this
botch. So it's not entierly futile.
But for the enum case I agree that GCC is hossed and simply shouldn't
warn about it if in C99 mode. Personally I was just still thinking at 
C89 level. Well after all I already fixed this in the GCC I use.
And no matter what - there is not much working in the sysctl area and
non sized array forward declarations are not a nice thing both: to read 
and to the compiler. Same applies to the gratitious macro or ({ }) 
overusages in the other patches. Inlined functions how the advantage of
1. stricter type checking.
2. Possibly faster compilation(if only included by files which really 
use them of course)
