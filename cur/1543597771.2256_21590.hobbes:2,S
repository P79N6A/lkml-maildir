No, it applies even to 4-byte protocol (see 1).
1) Re-synchronize on transmission errors (e.g. lost bytes)
The 4-byte protocol shares bytes 1-3 with the 3-byte protocol.
So it can synchronize just as easy.
2) Re-connecting the mouse
The 4-byte wheelmouse protocol must be re-enabled by sending proper
magic bytes by user-level driver (else it stays in 3-byte mode).
_This_ shows, user-mode must be notified of the re-connect! So letting
the driver choose PS2_TRANSPARENT, it can easily handle this situation.
3) Re-connecting a different animal
The user-level driver should autodetect common mouse protocols
(legacy proprietary protocols will vanish and should not hinder progress).
