HI all,
Im haveing a problem with ALSA, my sound card is an Analoge Devices AD1981B my lsmod follows:
snd_pcm_oss            48772  0
snd_mixer_oss          17280  1 snd_pcm_oss
nvidia               1701356  12
aes                    31552  1
snd_via82xx            21760  4
snd_pcm                88000  3 snd_pcm_oss,snd_via82xx
snd_ac97_codec         52228  1 snd_via82xx
snd_page_alloc          9220  2 snd_via82xx,snd_pcm
snd_mpu401_uart         6016  1 snd_via82xx
snd_rawmidi            20928  1 snd_mpu401_uart
with mm4 the aplay program exits with a seg fault and the xmms alsa 0.9 output plugin hangs, also any ps -aux or kill/killall commands hang with no output and dont answer a ctrl+c after trying to play somthing via xmms alsa output
in 2.6.0-test9 vanilla all the alsa stuff works fine and i think in 2.6.0-t9-mm3 (ill confirm if it does) but in 2.6.0-t9-mm4 it seems to be broken at least for my card. OSS emulation works fine tho with 2.6.0-t9-mm4 
if any more information would be helpfull to any one please let me know whats needed.
Thanx
TK
