Since I expect people who will read this documentation to be familiar
with kprobes already, I tried to make the adaptation process as easy as
possible for them. You will find similar examples in
Documentation/kprobes.txt.
Also, this kind of example, which describes what kernel code is needed
to use the markers (this can be either a separate kernel module or
embedded in the kernel, like the blktrace example), seems to be a
straightforward way to teach people how to use the markers.
