Which is wrong usage of mutex.

No, it is not. You probably want just to have a single-bit flag somewhere, 
and update/check it atomically, see below.

No, as it is a real bug if you use mutexes in this way. What happens if 
process that has called open() on your device (and has not closed it yet) 
calls fork()? 
Another breakage scenario -- what if the filedescriptor is sent through 
unix socket to another process? etc.
Look at test_and_set_bit_lock() and clear_bit_unlock(), those you want to 
use.
