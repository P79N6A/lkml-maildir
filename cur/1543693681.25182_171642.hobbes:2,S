Applied.
Please, Krzysztof, linux-kernel and Linus are not the appropriate
place to submit networking (device driver or otherwise) patches.
Therefore, in the future send it to netdev@oss.sgi.com and CC: either
Jeff Garzik or myself, thanks.
I'd also not classify this patch as trivial, it's not like a missing
semicolon or a comment typo, real thought needs to be applied to
analyzing whether your fix were correct or not.
