No, it's not.
Let me explain what I have in mind.
For starters, please observe that the addresses we use are page-aligned,
so the least significant bit is always zero.  Thus it can be used as a marker.
Now before we save the image we can mark blank pages by setting
the least significant bit of .orig_address to 1 in the coresponding PBEs.
We save the "marked" .orig_address values to the image.
Then, when we are about to save the page, we check the least
significant bit of its .orig_address, and save it only if this bit is zero.
When we are about to load a page, we first get a _zeroed_ page for it.
Next, we check if its .orig_address has the least significant bit set.
If not, we load the page, and otherwise we only clear that bit
(the page is already zero).

This is in the works.
