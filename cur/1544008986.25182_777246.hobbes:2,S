I get:
pci 0000:00:1f.0: quirk: region 1000-107f claimed by ICH6 ACPI/GPIO/TCO
pci 0000:00:1f.0: quirk: region 1100-113f claimed by ICH6 GPIO
pci 0000:00:1f.0: ICH7 LPC Generic IO decode 1 PIO at 0500 (mask 007f)
pci 0000:00:1f.0: ICH7 LPC Generic IO decode 4 PIO at 02e8 (mask 0007)
The ICH6 and ICH7 in those messages is a bit weird given that my system is 
ICH8...
