Great! Thanks for the testing!
Andrew: While clearly there is the deeper issue of why interrupts are
enabled before they should be, I may still like to push the two-liner
above, since its a bit safer should someone accidentally enable
interrupts early again. Looking back in my patch history it was
previously in the order above until I switched it (I suspect
accidentally) in the C0 rework.
I also added a warning message so we can still detect the problem w/o
hanging.
Does the patch below look reasonable?
thanks
