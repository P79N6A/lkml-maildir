This isn't necessarily true.  If you're running a trusted operating
system, you can set it up so that administrators do not have unlimited
power.  For example, here at Argus (

) we have
a B1 level Trusted OS that makes this sort of high-end security possible.
HP and SunFederal make products with similar capability.
