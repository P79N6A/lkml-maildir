Subject: Symbios 53c875 breakage in 2.2.10-ac10

Hardware in question:
DEC Alpha PC164SX motherboard, 21164PC CPU
Symbios logic 53c875 SCSI controller (ASUS SC875, not sure which revision)
IBM DFHSS2W 2.1GB Fast-10 Wide disk at ID 0
IBM 0662S12 1.08GB Fast-10 Narrow disk at ID 1
Plextor PX43CH CD-ROM at ID 2
It works quite well with 2.2.7, 2.2.10, and 2.2.10-ac5, using the sym53c8xx
driver.
With 2.2.10-ac10, however, it does not work at all with either the sym53c8xx
or ncr53c8xx drivers.
The sym53c8xx driver reports something like this (might not be exact, as I
wrote it down on paper while watching the errors go by):
sym53c875-0: Downloading SCSI SCRIPTS
sym53c875-0:0: ERROR (a0:0) (8-0-0) (0/5) @ (script 40:f3100000)
sym53c875-0: script cmd = 90080000
sym53c875-0: regdump: ca 00 00 05 47 00 00 0f 71 08 00 00 80 00 08 0a
upon which it resets the SCSI bus and does the same thing, ad nauseaum
(actually, the error alternates between '(0-0-0)' and '(8-0-0)')
The ncr53c8xx driver reports that the cache was set up incorrectly (IIRC...
I didn't manage to write that one down) and simply fails to initialize.
It appears that something external to the driver itself is causing this
problem, because there were no changes to sym53c8xx.c between -ac5 and
-ac10, and only minimal changes between 2.2.10 and 2.2.10-ac5.
Cheers
