Ah yes.  Your lucky it's only a 37KB download.  Some nice tools...
It's a _lot_ of output so I'm again rather attaching it (gzipped).
Would this quirk also imply usb-handoff?
One (hopefully) last query, lspci reports the following device (which I
assume is the SD card reader):
0000:02:04.2 Class 0805: ENE Technology Inc: Unknown device 0550
How can one confirm what this is?
