Yes, I think that is correct.  But, I don't think the code (always) 
prevents nohz mode when the clocksource *watchdog* is !IS_CONTINUOUS.
Anyway, the bug doesn't require that nohz mode is enabled, it just 
requires that the PIT clockevent is shutdown (or otherwise not 
programmed in periodic mode).

I didn't check if nohz was disabled when the PIT clocksource is switched 
to, but I did check that the PIT was not the active clockevent, which is 
enough for this bug.
I also didn't do a whole lot of digging to see what the problems this 
bug can cause in practice, but after the PIT clocksource was installed, 
I tried 'sleep 1' and this did not wake up.
