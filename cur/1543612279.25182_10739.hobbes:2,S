What you probably want to do in real life is to move a process to a cpu
and have all its child spawned on that cpu, that is the actual behavior.
Can't You achieve the same by coding a :
pid_t affine_fork(int cpumask) {
	pid_t pp = fork();
	if (pp == 0) {
		set_affinity(getpid(), cpumask);
		...
	}
	return pp;
}
in your application and having the default bahavior to propagate it to the
following fork()s.

You want Al Viro screaming, don't You ? :)
