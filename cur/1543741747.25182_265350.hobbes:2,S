Memtest is happy with my memory too, if all 4 modules are installed in the 
slots belonging to CPU1. If I install 2 modules for each CPU, memtest86 is 
not happy anymore.

The boards are nearly identical (on-board lan is different, and your 
memory-slots are connected to one CPU).
If all memory modules are installed for one CPU, I have your problems. 
Additionaly there are some other problems that only occur, when the 
modules are installed one pair for each CPU.
Since I have a pre-producion board and bios which is running solid as a 
rock, regardless if a SMP/no-SMP kernel is installed, I hope that they
will fix all problems.
