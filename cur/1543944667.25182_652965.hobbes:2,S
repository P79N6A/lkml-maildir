This is essentially the same process I've been using in wireless-2.6
with the (regularly rebased) 'everything' branch.  Still I find
that it causes lots of confusion and complaining.  Perhaps I am not
communicating clearly enough... :-)
Do you find that people are happy with that process?  Forgive me for
not knowing, but how many developers are actively (or occasionaly)
involved in ocfs2 and configfs?  How many 'normal' users pull your
tree looking for 'latest and greatest' code?
