I use both reiserfs and ext3 on lvm/dm on raid.
Both filesystems have issues when restoring from backup (i.e. very heavy
write activity).
I did report this to the linux kernel, and got as reply that there are
indeed races *somewhere*, but as of yet there is no fix.
The symptoms are _not_ I/O errors (but until I see logs I wouldn't believe
you that there are real I/O errors), but usually too-high block numbers.
A reboot fixes this for both ext3 and reiserfs (i.e. the error is gone).
You might want to explore this problem and decide for yourself if it's caused
by I/O errors (in which case you have a disk problem) or "just" filesystem
corruption.
