Actually, swsusp with the speed-up patches requires quite a lot of RAM to
write to disk asynchronously.  This effectively means that on my box the image
size should not exceed 3/8 of the total RAM size, or the synchronous writing
will start due to the lack of memory.
uswsusp doesn't seem to have this problem.
