With the appletalk code in 2.3.51, I can no longer use
netatalk. Both getzones and papstatus try to bind to
apparently the all zero address and get EADDRINUSE
Also, the one who created apparently had some
confusion over Apple terminology. APPLETALK
is the protocol, and LOCALTALK is Apple's attempt
at a proprietary physical layer, so the directory
in drivers/net should be called localtalk.
Also, the kernel doesn't link if APPLETALK is enabled
since drivers/net/appletalk/appletalk.a does not exist
