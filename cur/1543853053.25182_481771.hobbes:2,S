There seem to be many implementations of WPA, including:
   tkip+tkip
   tkip+ccmp
   ccmp+ccmp
   ccmp+tkip
Perhaps only some modes are working, and some are not?
The "wpa_cli" utility will show which combo is in use
(the "status" subcommand), and will also show what is happening
if you run it while wpa_supplicant is trying to connect.
My own ipw2200 here, on 2.6.18, seems to work with all of the
WPA/WPA2 combinations that my two APs have tried, including
three of the above four scenarios.
But I have updated to  v0.5.5 of the wpa_supplicant daemon for this,
and maybe that's the problem here -- daemon too old/buggy?
Cheers
