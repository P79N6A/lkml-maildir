Although some individuals did tell about their 'visions' in this thread,
there were serious arguments against their use for anything else except
specialities like CIFS support. Many people do just not care about most
of the 'visions'.

But it has the serious problem that handling a S_IFREG file in just the
usual manner will lead to silent data loss. Even with all POSIX issues
left aside, this seems hardly acceptable to me.

As long as POSIX is only violated by some patch, people can ignore this
problem by just not applying it. Such will be possible even if Reiser4 is
integrated in the future; lack of POSIX conformance for FAT filesystems is
also not much of an issue.
The interesting point is that future VFS changes do not lead to POSIX
violations.
