Hi Maciej,
I have been waiting for you to point this out because I believe it
shows where more work is needed in net_dma.  The problem with net_dma
is that it never says "I am done with dma channels".  The result was
the old/complicated per-operation reference counting in dmaengine that
lead to the, now deleted, comment for ioat_remove():
/*
 * It is unsafe to remove this module: if removed while a requested
 * dma is outstanding, esp. from tcp, it is possible to hang while
 * waiting for something that will never finish.  However, if you're
 * feeling lucky, this usually works just fine.
 */
This also required the complexity of each client needing to handle
asynchronous channel removal events.  In all other cases in the kernel
a module is pinned as long as it has users, so dmaengine was backwards
in this regard.
Putting the end-node principal to work here means that the
complexity/effort of determining when net_dma is done with channels
should reside in net_dma, not dmaengine.  Since we cannot hook into a
"rmmod net" event to drop the dmaengine reference we will need some
out-of-band signal to enable "rmmod ioatdma" like detecting
network-idle, or having an explicit "dma disable" sysctl.

All channels share the same parent module, so taking a reference on
one will always involve blocking all channels.  Private channels have
this granularity, and this is a primary difference between public and
private channels.  I eventually want dmaengine to hook into cpu
hotplug notifications to guarantee that resources are only allocated
for channels with a non-zero ->table_count, but this is not there
today.

To be clear show_in_use was broken before because it only looked at a
per-cpu variable[1], the situation is better now because it indeed
shows "potential" users in the public case and actual users in the
private case.  I.e. if a public channel client has the potential to
get this channel via dma_find_channel() then that will be reflected in
->client_count.

This is changed in later patches [2].  We repeat for each channel in
the dma_request_channel() case under the assumption that the client
may be smart enough to disambiguate the channels on other criteria.

Good point... will fix.
