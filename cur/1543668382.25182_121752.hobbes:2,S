You should use the c99 initializers, though.
struct file_operations read_fifo_fops = {
        .llseek		= no_llseek,
        .read		= pipe_read,
        .write		= bad_pipe_w,
        .poll		= fifo_poll,
        .ioctl		= pipe_ioctl,
        .open		= pipe_read_open,
        .release	= pipe_read_release,
};
