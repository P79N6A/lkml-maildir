yes, it's ok now, Stephen's fix is in 2.3.43. (and also David's fix for
__flush_tlb_global assembly constraint bug is in pre3-2.3.44 - this should
unbreak Athlons for example.)

This is new to me - pagecache in highmem is just as fast here as in lowmem
(as far as dbench numbers go). If there is any problem i'd like to hear
about it.
