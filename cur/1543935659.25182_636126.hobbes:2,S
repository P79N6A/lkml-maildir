Kevin's patch adds the lock/unlock to drm_ioctl which is exactly what I 
don't want, I want to have drm_ioctl become drm_unlocked_ioctl, and 
drm_ioctl to wrap it with the lock/unlocks, then the drivers can all
use unlocked_ioctl like Kevins patch pointing to drm_ioctl, and can 
migrate over to drm_unlocked_ioctl post lock auditing, the new latest i915 
driver seems to be fine with unlocked ioctls so far..
Yes I can use Kevin's patch as a base most likely, but it doesn't do what 
I want yet, and I've already started to do it properly in the drm upstream 
trees....
Dave.
