Hi guys,
my PPP connection to my ISP is dead after he's changed his PPP server.
My machine, that has worked fine before the change, and in which I've not
installed nothing new after the last
successful connection, seems to estabilish the link but the line is broken.
Also a simple ping to the remote ip address fail, not in a way that
specifies that the host is unreachable,
but simply the ping seems to not respond to the command without return the
prompt.
On the other NT boot I've in the same machine, things continue to work fine.
There is an error message which states that pppd can't determine ethernet
address, this is the only "strange"
behaviour that I've noticed.
This is strange because my network card is correctly configured.
Anyway I've tried to disable the proxyarp option, the message disappear but
the link is still broken.
My PC has a correctly configured network card, even if here ( at home ) I've
not a network.
It seems that all negotiation steps are successfully completed but packets
don't go away to my ISP.
Anyway I repeat that nothing is changed after the last connection.
Just for information I have Debian 2.0, Kernel 2.2.13, gcc-2.95.2,
glibc-2.0.7 (12-98 revision ).
Here I report a tail of ppp.log and an ifconfig command :
