I just figured out something interesting. Apparently there's a small timing
problem with setting up the NIC: If I put in a sleep 1 between setting up
the interface and setting up the gateway route, everything works pretty well.
So things now look like this:
/sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
/sbin/route add -net 127.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 lo
/sbin/ifconfig eth0   a.b.c.d broadcast x.y.225.255    netmask 255.255.255.0
/sbin/ifconfig eth0:0 a.b.c.d broadcast 172.16.255.255 netmask 255.255.0.0
sleep 1 # This does the trick
/sbin/route add default gw a.b.c.d netmask 0.0.0.0 metric 1

http://support.intel.com/support/network/adapter/pro100/21397.htm
has a list of Board-Assembly IDs and the corresponding chip revisions.
