Agreed. What we need is a 2.6 that is relatively easy to
stabilise, not one that'll take until 2.6.20 to become
stable.
If some of the other features turn out to be needed, they
can always be backported from 2.7.  In fact, backporting
from 2.7 is probably _quicker_ than throwing in too many
features just before the feature freeze and then try to
stabilise them all at once together...

Rik
