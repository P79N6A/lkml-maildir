Exactly.

I just cc'ed him in the original email as well (in february) so he should
be just uptodate (I had no feedback though).

That was my point. The common case is the kmem_cache_create in init_module
and kmem_cache_destroy in cleanup_module. I am not sure if it worth to do
the garbage collection thing suggested by Dave. We not are breaking the
old interface at all adding a new API. (but now you are allowed to do some
more thing if yoy want) The old code will continue to work of course since
the old code (obviously ;) don't need the new function.
