Hi all,
I have been playing with 2.5 kernel since 2.5.3[0123] has been released.
I have a laptop, it is a HP omnibook 6000.
So far, I have reported the following bugs that are still open:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395
^^^^ This one is really nasty, no sound no mp3, no oggs, no tests
about interactivity.
I still have to fill another bug in bugzilla,
I described it here: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=104854641000005&r=1&w=2&n=1
Is anyone using the same hardware ?
I can test patches, if needed.
Regards and ciao,
                Paolo
