In an attempt to characterize the effects of cache coloring in 
the os for a modern Intel processor, I spent a couple of days 
hacking the Linux kernel and experimenting with a toy program. 
The kernel patch does a gross type of colored allocation by 
grabbing pages from the free list until it gets one of the right
color - the intent is not to study the os overheads of doing
colored allocations, rather the benefits a program might see from
using pages allocated in such fashion. My findings are at
        
http://reality.sgi.com/kanoj_engr/ccdis.html
and it has at least one unexplained observation. If you are
interested in this sort of thing, please browse it and send me
comments about how I can improve the study. Pointers to apps which 
are suspected to benefit from cache coloring would also help.
Thanks.
