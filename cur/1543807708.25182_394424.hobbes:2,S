Hi,
I'm new to kernel programming and wanted to try to develop my first "real" 
kernel module. Up to now I only programmed little, useless, modules to get 
into the kernel.
Because there is no module for the Ricoh Memory Host Adapter, which is in my 
notebook, I want to start developing one.
00:0a.2 Class 0805: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822 SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter (rev 
17)
The problem is, that I have absolutely no idea where to start. When I'm 
looking at the code of existing MMC modules, I wanna start cry.
Do you have any tips, tutorials, ... how I can start, step by step, the 
development of this module?
Sincereley,
Alexander Nassian
