I don't know the entire history behind platform_data but my
understanding is that it was designed to provide a mechanism for
platform-specific code to pass info to drivers.
I *believe* that this would be a proper use of platform_data but I'm
hoping someone out in lkml-land who knows better than I will confirm that.

I agree.  We can and absolutely should do this at run-time if a merged
driver is feasible.  I'll dig thru the datasheets today and start
prototyping some code if it looks like we can merge the code.
