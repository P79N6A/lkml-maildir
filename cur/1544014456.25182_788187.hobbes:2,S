Please, no. Adding a compatibility quirk may be acceptable, but forcing
everyone to use it instead of the more efficient original code is not
fair.

Are you certain the nForce2 controllers can't do it? The i2c-nforce2
driver doesn't implement it, but this doesn't mean the hardware can't
do it. I don't have any datasheet for these chips, but I know their
SMBus implementation is very similar to those of the AMD 8111, and
i2c-amd8111 has support for I2C block reads and writes. I think it
would be worth giving it a try, by copying the i2c-amd8111
implementation into the i2c-nforce2 driver and seeing if it happens to
just work. If it works, that would be more elegant than your proposed
hack to the rtc-ds1307 driver.

See above.
