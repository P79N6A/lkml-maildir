Good point - file/dir creation/removal should only be done by
relay_open/close.  I'll make sure to fix both of these things.

Yes, there are a couple of bugs here, but I think they're easily fixed
- thanks for spotting them.
For the buffer->data problem, the value of buffer->data at the time
offset is reserved would have to be saved along with it for it to make
sense.
For relay_switch_buffer(), only the offset of the first event that
didn't fit would be less than bufsize so if there was a check for that
i.e. if offset < bufsize, calculate padding, otherwise don't and just
continue, the interrupt would continue through and actually accomplish
the buffer switch, while the interrupted event would calculate the
padding and then exit immediately because of the (offset + length <
bufsize) recheck.  Both would then loop around again to retry and
succeed.  Well, I'm not sure that explanation is clear, but it seems
like it should work with that small change.
Please let me know if you disagree or see any other problems.

Yes, I was actually planning on doing that, but hadn't gotten to it
yet.
Thanks,
