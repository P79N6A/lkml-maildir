Hey Benny,
This is a chipset problem. Chipsets support up to x CAS (column) lines
and y RAS (row) lines, and depending on your DIMM memory module layout
and configuration, you 512MB DIMM will be detected as a different sized
module.
Eg. The venerable Intel 440BX (PII) chipset supports a max of 256MB per
slot. Ah well.
Since it's a chipset (ie hardware) issue, it's not possible to work
around this problem - you need a newer chipset. Sorry.
Dan
