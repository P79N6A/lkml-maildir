	Well, I thought that since depmod constructed the list of
	dependecies, it would be a natural place for looking for the
	defaults... Silly me.
	Oh, modprobe -c isn't precisely what I wanted. I wanted the
	factory defaults and modprobe -c actually gives me the factory
	defaults (possibly) overriden by the defaults that I've put in
	modules.conf.
	I know, I know, I'm stupid (I'm the first to admit): I didn't
	have the idea of deleting modules.conf to see the defaults.
	So, since I was getting desperate, I used strings depmod. :-)

	I think that I should now be wearing the brown bag
	now... Indeed you're right and this has nothing to do with
	modutils. I don't know what I was thinking about when I wrote
	the suggestion above. Perhaps that I was the result of being
	not thinking.
	*BUT* (and here is my excuse) the documentation relating to my
	sound card wasn't in the Documentation subtree. That's why I
	had problems trying to upgrade from my older modutils to your
	new version. I made sure to read the documentation (even
	documents that are not directly connected to sound boards).

	For instance, the kernel docs don't mention the problem people
	were having with sound-slot-0-1, for instance. I think that it
	would be very instructive if it was mentioned. It could save
	people some time and surfing the web. :-(
	I could add this to the Documentation tree, if desired, but it
	would probably be best done by someone more knowledgeable...
	Ok, since now I'm getting farther and farther away from the
	subject of modutils, I'm gonna stop. :-)
	[]s, Roger...
