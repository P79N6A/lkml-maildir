Hi,
I am running Fed. Core 3 on my laptop (Asus M6NE) with an Intel Mobile
Centrino for cpu.
I've been seeing the following lingering error message in
/var/log/messages in regards to ACPI, which I don't know how to fix.
PROBLEM:  Error messags in /var/log/messages on ACPI:
=====================================================
kernel:  ACPI-1133: *** Error: Method execution failed [\_SB_.BAT0._BST]
(Node dfe043c0), AE_AML_NO_RETURN_VALUE
lastt message repeated 2 times
last message repeated 4 times
...
...
I've attached the system info.
