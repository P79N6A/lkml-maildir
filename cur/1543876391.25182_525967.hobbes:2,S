 # Timer Interrupt Frequency Configuration

-choice
-	prompt "Timer frequency"
-	default HZ_250
-	help
-	 Allows the configuration of the timer frequency. It is customary
-	 to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 Hz but 100 Hz may be more
-	 beneficial for servers and NUMA systems that do not need to have
-	 a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus
-	 contention and cacheline bounces as a result of timer interrupts.
-	 Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP
-	 environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts
-	 per second.
-
-
-	config HZ_100
-		bool "100 HZ"
-	help
-	  100 Hz is a typical choice for servers, SMP and NUMA systems
-	  with lots of processors that may show reduced performance if
-	  too many timer interrupts are occurring.
-
-	config HZ_250
-		bool "250 HZ"
-	help
-	 250 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
-	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
-	 on SMP and NUMA systems. If you are going to be using NTSC video
-	 or multimedia, selected 300Hz instead.
-
-	config HZ_300
-		bool "300 HZ"
-	help
-	 300 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
-	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
-	 on SMP and NUMA systems and exactly dividing by both PAL and
-	 NTSC frame rates for video and multimedia work.
-
-	config HZ_1000
-		bool "1000 HZ"
-	help
-	 1000 Hz is the preferred choice for desktop systems and other
-	 systems requiring fast interactive responses to events.
