OK but he speaks about special type of access, no ordering constraint.
I don't think that MIPS cpu reorder memory access, but gcc can ! And I
don't think that the use of 'volatile' can prevent it to do that.

ok thanks for this, but once again, there's no ordering constraint garantuee.

I hope so...It's hard to find out an answer to such questions (maybe
it's the case only for MIPS arch) although it's an important point.
Thanks.
