Note also that there is a 50% reduction in CPU usage for writes (27% for
rewrites).  This is important when you are trying to maximize IO from a
single server.  I'm not sure why the read CPU usage increased, though it
may just be a result of increased memcpy due to the higher read throughput
(32% increase in read performance, 18% increase in CPU usage).

One of the main reasons this isn't in the kernel yet is that the extents
on-disk format is incompatible with the current ext3 on-disk format.
That is OK for Lustre because the storage servers are essentially
"appliances" that are used in well-controlled environments, but this
isn't so good when random users get involved.  The patches couldn't be
merged until there was some consensus reached about the extents on-disk
format.
There is work currently underway with Red Hat, IBM, CFS, and Bull
to merge the extents support into the kernel.org ext3 code and the
official e2fsprogs, and this will likely also be in the upcoming RHEL5.
Once this is done it will be possible to merge the mballoc and delalloc
changes also.
Cheers, Andreas
