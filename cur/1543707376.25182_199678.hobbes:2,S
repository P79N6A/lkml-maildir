And there are a reasonable number of us who build kernels without dm, 
lvm, and actually run working servers on them.
Having not had problems with either file or device backed cryptoloop I'm 
not eager to go do some new gee-whiz thing which require training time, 
new bugs to be fixed (unless you think this is more perfect than 
anything else in the kernel), etc.
Taking features out of a stable kernel, particularly those which work 
for many people, doesn't sound right, somehow. New features don't break 
existing setups, but removal of a feature seems to be more appropriate 
for 2.7. Of course by them it's likely that bugs will be removed and 
there will be no justification to remove it.
