This one I'd really hesitate to use. We do _not_ want to trust the BIOS
any more than necessary (obviously trusting even the e820 was too much),
and especially wrt MTRR's we know that there are too many buggy bioses
already out there.

This will be easy.
In fact, we can easily "mix" different heuristics. Ie we'd do the simple
thing I suggested in setup_arch(), and use that as a "base guess", and
then we can have incremental improvements on that guess that might be
chipset-specific or might depend on other information that is not
necessarily generic (things like existing PCI programming etc).
