Ok, I will give it a try as soon as I can bounce the machine. I also
noticed that if I run tcpdump on the interface, it appears completely dead
when this happens. I can not see incoming or outgoing traffic or any
traffic on the wire. It DOES seem that if I maintian a steady stream of
outgoing traffic, the interface will stay up for a longer period of time.
If I go idle for any period of time or have only inbound traffic (ftp
download for example) it will die faster.
