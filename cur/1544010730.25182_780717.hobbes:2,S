Possibly, you are right, but the amount of changes would be very big, 
while the net_priv patch I did is just 309 lines long including all the 
descriptions and comments. And it's really simple and straightforward.

I understand your fears, but I think there can be another view on this. 
There are 2 layers: TCP and iSCSI. ISCSI asks TCP to send data and TCP 
performs that. ISCSI communicates with TCP using sendpage() function, it 
asks TCP to send pages. So, the unit of communications is page. When TCP 
finished transmitting a page, it notifies iSCSI that the page was 
transmitted. Now iSCSI needs to find out its own command, associated 
with that page. It does that using page->net_priv, which keeps pointer 
to the associated iSCSI command. I don't think there is any layer 
violation here, because iSCSI and TCP communicate using pages, not any 
other objects. If they communicated using, e.g., skb, no doubts, it 
would be a layers violation.
But, since iSCSI and TCP communicate using pages, the situation is the 
same as between SCST core and a target driver in the on_free_cmd() 
example I used before. When SCST core notifies the target driver using 
on_free_cmd() callback that a command finished and is about to be freed, 
the target driver also needs to find out its own associated with the 
command data and it does that using tgt_priv pointer in struct scst_cmd. 
Similarly, for instance, struct scsi_cmnd has host_scribble pointer for 
low level drivers.
