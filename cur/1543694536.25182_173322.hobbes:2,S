FWIW, I've been using laptop-mode for a long time now, with no problems
whatsoever. It's a great addition and really helps laptop users.
On a related note, a very desirable feature would be to be able to trace
which processes do I/O. Unfortunately, Linux distributions aren't very
well adapted to laptops and many applications are way too
"trigger-happy" when it comes to hard drive accesses. I guess most
developers don't use laptops and just assume that they can write or
read data at will. It is very difficult to trace the culprits when your
HD light goes on every couple of seconds.
