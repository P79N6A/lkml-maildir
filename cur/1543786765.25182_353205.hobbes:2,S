Subject: [PATCH 3/3] 2.6.14-rc2-mm1 : fixes for overflow in sys_poll()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/24/89

This patch simplifies the overflow fix which was applied to sys_poll() in
2.6.14-rc2-mm1 by relying on the overflow detection code added to jiffies.h
by patch 1/3. This also removes a useless divide for HZ <= 1000.
It might be worth applying too. It's only for -mm1, and does *not* apply
to 2.6.14-rc2 because this code has already received patches in -mm1.
