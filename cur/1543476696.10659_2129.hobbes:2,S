According to the Solaris man-pages (5.5.1) it suspends the calling thread
until the child either calls exec*() or exits.
As I said earlier, this ISN'T in the online version of SUSv2!!! This makes
ALL implementations I have heard of non-SUSv2 compliant, EXCEPT the 'alias
fork to vfork' ones!
I'm not sure the version that the SUSv2 manual pages document is
especially usefull, if nothing else it's FAR more dangerous if you
actually implement VM sharing (for a starter I don't want to think
about what could happen to the stack if you returned from the current
function in the original thread BEFORE you either call exit*() or exit the
program!)
The more I think of it the more I suspect that the official online SUSv2
documentation simply is wrong, EXCEPT that the description given fits the
aliasing implementation perfectly...
Aliasing fork() to vfork() is beginning to sound more and more
promising...
