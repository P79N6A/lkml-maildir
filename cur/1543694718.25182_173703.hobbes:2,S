That's what the patch against 2.4 did.  I'm banging on a 2.6 version, but 
Manuel's continuing to optimize bunzip over in busybox cvs (I'm good at 
cleaning up and simplifying, but he's way better at optimizing), and I'm 
waiting ot see the results (and starting a micro-version of the compression 
side code in the meantime, which is irrelevant here...)
