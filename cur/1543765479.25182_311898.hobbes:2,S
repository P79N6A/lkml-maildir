Yes. (Note that mounting in the first place is the problem. Even if
you umount it, you already did some changes on disk, BAD).

Should not be a problem with new refrigerator setup.

Should not me a problem.

I don't see why calling it repeatedly would be that bad. In fact, it
is what we are doing just now. You can try to resume as many times as
you wish (by echo resume...), but obviously at most one of those will
succeed.
