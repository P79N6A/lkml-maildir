To be more exact:
- GNU/Hurd, the  whole systems, is  actually GNU tools  (libc, linker,
  ...)  on top  of the  GNU Hurd  (set of  servers) and  the  GNU Mach
  microkernel.
- GNU Mach 1.x uses drivers from Linux 2.0.36 (IIRC)
- GNU  Mach 2.0  (actually 1.9,  as a  beta version),  uses  the OSKit
  framework, and such drivers from Linux 2.2.12 (but nearly any driver
  for Linux  2.2 can  be easily ported)  or FreeBSD (I  don't remember
  which version, we actually use more Linux drivers).
- In the future, we'll probably use  the L4 microkernel. On top of L4,
  we'll have  to implement user space drivers.   That'ld probably take
  time, so  we may reuse Linux  drivers with glue code  as a temporary
  solution.
- pfinet (our  TCP/IP server)  comes from Linux  2.0 IP stack,  but we
  need a rewrite for that (first  because Linux 2.0 stack's is not the
  best in  the world ;) and  then because kernel-space  code runned in
  user-space with glue code isn't either fast nor flexible).
I'm not aware  of other use of Linux code inside  the Hurd project, or
even inside the GNU project, but there may be.
