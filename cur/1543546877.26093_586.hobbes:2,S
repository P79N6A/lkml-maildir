Umm... I would not do that. Reason: right now BKL can be acquired while we
are holding a spinlock. It's a bad idea, but it's possible. With your
change it becomes deadly. Another reason: currently BKL can be taken in
the middle of operations on per-CPU data. It will not block, so nothing
will get that CPU while we are in lock_kernel(). Not true with your patch.
