You need to re-enable the dir_index feature, and then for directories which
are larger than a block in size you need something like:
	mkdir new_dir
	mv old_dir/* new_dir
	rmdir old_dir
	mv new_dir old_dir
The new directory will have htree enabled because it started out at 1 block
in size.
Cheers, Andreas
