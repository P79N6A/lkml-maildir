Yup, obviously ;) Sorry about that.

I'm still not happy at least for the ".config does not exist" case. Since 
when I forget to "cp ../config-2.5 .config", I don't really want "make 
oldconfig", I want to do the forgotten cp. I think there's hardly anyone 
who wants oldconfig in that case, rather menuconfig/xconfig or a cp like I 
mentioned. Since kbuild/lkc does not know, it shouldn't make that (bad) 
guess.
If .config exist but is not current, I think in 99% of the cases we really 
want make oldconfig, so that's fine.
