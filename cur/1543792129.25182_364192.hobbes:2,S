Yeah, take a look at rmap.c as well, and some of the comments in
changelogs if you need a better feel for it.
Basically SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU will allow the entries to be freed
back to the slab for reuse, but will not allow the slab caches to
be freed back to the page allocator inside rcu readside.
So your cpusets may be reused, but only as new cpusets. This should
be no problem at all for you.

You may also have to be careful about memory ordering when setting
a pointer which may be concurrently dereferenced by another CPU so
that stale data doesn't get picked up.
The set side needs an rcu_assign_pointer, and the dereference side
needs rcu_dereference. Unless you either don't care about races, or
already have the correct barriers in place. But it is better to be
safe.

Sounds like it should work.

No, because the slab caches can get freed back into the general
page allocator at any time.

Yes (slab debugging catches write-after-free at least, I believe),
however there are exceptions made for RCU freed slab caches. That
is: it is acceptable to access a freed RCU slab object, especially
if you only read it (writes need to be more careful, but they're
possible in some situations).

Not too sure at present. I think #1 might be a good idea though
it would be a bigger change. #2 again might be a good hack for
the time being, although it would be nice to try to get the same
performance from the normal cpuset fastpath.
My RCU suggestion was mainly an idea to get around your immediate
problem with a lockless fastpath, rather than advocating it over
any of the alternatives.
Thanks,
