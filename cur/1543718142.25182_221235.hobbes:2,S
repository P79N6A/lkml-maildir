then you've never been to japan.
but I think this got off track.
The salient issues as I understand them are:
pc9800 has been broken for a while. 
There is currently no maintainer.
it's not likely to become unbroken anytime soon.
the principle stakeholders would seem to be people with pc9800 machines 
who run linux which means input from the linux/98 project if it's still 
extant but baring that it's just a pile of dead code.
Looking back through my mail I see Alan Cox touched it sometime in the 
2.5.66 era.
