This might be a scenario.
In those cases one thread detects a low mem condition that has not been
handled [happens when much memory is allocated fast and kswapd has too
low prio to get run] by kswapd and tries to free some pages itself.
It succeeds. But waits/reschedules to a higher prio process.
During that run the higher prio process steels the pages.
Back to the original trying to get hold of the pages - no success...
Note: since this process is both __GFP_IO and __GFP_WAIT it could
happen during waiting for IO and not only due to the rescheduling in
do_try_to_free_pages()
