I don't think there's that much overhead, it's just not where people
have been focusing tuning efforts recently. If you run the numbers,
and point out specific problems, I'm sure people will fix them ;-)
In other words, I don't think the recent focus has caused a problem
for low end machines, it just hasn't really looked at solving one.

Can't we just use the existing config options instead? CONFIG_SMP is
a good start ;-) How many embedded systems with SMP do you have?
