Yeah, but..
My changes won't actually be incorporated (i hope) into the kernel. 
I've since learned that a goto will optimize to be just as quick as what
I wrote (by studying the optimized assembler output at other
suggestion).  Therefore, it was silly and pointless for me to spend the
10-12 minutes I did changing the code and testing it and e-mailing back
the changes.
So, there's nothing to worry about.  Goto's are here forever.
