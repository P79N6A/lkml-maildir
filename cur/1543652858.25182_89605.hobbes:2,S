BTW, results similar to Andy on my SMP system (the same problem
machine we'd talked about earlier). Same problem ?
with 2.5.47-bk2 
+ kexec patch for 2.5.47-bk2 attached in your mail
+ linux-2.5.47.x86kexec-hwfixes
and using

Descriptors changed.
Legacy pic setup.

What would be best way to pass a parameter or address from the
current kernel to kernel being booted (e.g log buffer address
or crash dump buffer etc) ? Should this be part of the interface,
i.e. could/would it make sense for kexec to support this (rather 
than our having to go and try to fix up kernel parameters ourselves,
or designate a fixed address for this) ? Also thinking
about other arch support for kexec in the future ...
