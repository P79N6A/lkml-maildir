Yes, i know of that limitation of make-kpkg, but i have forgotton to rename 
it for WOLK 3.1. You can do so easily for yourself my editing the patched 
kernel/full wolk kernel File Makefile and look for EXTRAVERSION = -WOLK3.1 
and rename it to -wolk3.1. Its in the 4th line of that File, or, if you 
haven't patched the vanilla at all or want to change it permanently for the 
patchset, edit 99_VERSION, look for +EXTRAVERSION = -WOLK3.1 and rename it 
too.
You want to support Debian Kernel Package of WOLK? I appreciate it :)
