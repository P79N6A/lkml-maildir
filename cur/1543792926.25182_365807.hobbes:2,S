I'm probably asking a silly question here, but presumably you've grabbed 
ieee80211 1.1.6 and ipw2200 1.0.8 from their respective websites, compiled 
them, installed them (whilst running 2.6.14) and the resulting driver does 
not work?

I completely agree with this assessment, I was merely defending the "linux 
development process" which I do not believe to be at fault here.
