Just a remark on a piece of code I see done a lot,
when formatting things for printf in columns, do this:
	print "%-25s %s\n", ...
	  note! ----^
This _guarentees_ a space between one field ond the next. Ps and ls are
examples of commands whose output is regularly mangled in this way by
wide column values. Enforcing a single space between fields in the format
string avoids this. If the extra width bugs you, notch the %-25s down one.
There's plenty of formatting out there subject to this problem; let's
not help it with examples.
Cheers,
