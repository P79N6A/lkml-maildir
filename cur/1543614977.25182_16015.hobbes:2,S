Andrew,
	Well, I was making reference to Solaris where I have seen
lots of X11 crashes mean framebuffer crashes which means the console
is unusable.   I haven't played with it on Linux enough to know for sure that 
Linux doesn't suffer the same problems.  If that's true, then hats off to you
all for again showing how Solaris sucks.
