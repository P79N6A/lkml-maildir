There's a reason that KEY_POWER and KEY_SLEEP are already present in 
/usr/include/linux/input.h. It makes sense to expose keys that are on my 
keyboard in the same way as other keys on my keyboard. Just think of the 
ACPI events interface as a bus that a small keyboard with not many keys 
sits on.
From the userspace point of view, it's *far* easier to deal with this 
stuff if the keys generate keycodes.
