To add to the pain, lsof or fuser hang on unresponsive shares.
I wrote my own wrapper to go through the "/proc/<pid>" file tables and
find any process using the unresponsive mounts and kill those
processes.This works well.
Also, it brings another point. If the unresponsives problem cannot be
fixed for some NFS data corruption reasons, is it possible for a mount
to have both soft & hard semantics? Some process might want to use the
mount point soft and other processes hard. This can be implemented
easily in NFS & SUNRPC layers adding timeout to requests, but it
becomes tricky in VFS layer. If a soft proces is waiting on an inode
locked by a hard process, the soft process gets hard semantics too.
Thanks
