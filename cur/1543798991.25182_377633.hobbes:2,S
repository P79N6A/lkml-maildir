Good point. However, it really _is_ hard, because we also need to know if 
the mutex was under contention. A spinlock doesn't care, so we can just 
overwrite the lock value. A mutex would always care, in order to know 
whether it needs to do the slow wakeup path. 
So I suspect you can't avoid serializing the unlock path for a mutex. The 
issue of "was there contention while I held it" fundamentally _is_ a 
serializing question.

Oh, absolutely, I already checked the old BK history too, and that extra 
wake_up() has been there at least since before we even started using BK. 
So it's very much historical, I'm just wondering if somebody remembers far 
enough back that we'd know.
I don't see why it's needed (since we re-try the "atomic_add_negative()" 
inside the semaphore wait lock, and any up() that saw contention should 
have always been guaranteed to do a wakeup that should fill the race in 
between that atomic_add_negative() and the thing going to sleep). 
It may be that it is _purely_ historical, and simply isn't needed. That 
would be funny/sad, in the sense that we've had it there for years and 
years ;)
