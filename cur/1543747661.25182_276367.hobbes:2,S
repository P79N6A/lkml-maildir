Ok, I got some time this evening to run memtest86.  With the 2650
configured with 2 1GB sticks memtest86 started reprting errors almost
immediately.  "Terrfic!" I thought, "this is my problem!"  The address
seemed suspicious though:  0007ffedc80 (2047.8MB) is where all the
errors were reported.  I decided to let it run all the way through but
it froze at 34% of the first test.  Memtest86 also said it did not
support this chipset when I tried to dink with advanced options.
So, I replaced the ram with 4 512MB sticks I had laying around from a
different Dell machine.  I booted memtest86 again and what do you
know.... errors @ 0007ffedc80, with completely different RAM.  So
obviously these results are fishy.
Someone replied to me off-list and said the only way they could get
their Dell 2650 stable was by running 2.4.28.
