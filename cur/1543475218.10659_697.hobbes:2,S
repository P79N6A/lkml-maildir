Hello, everybody!
I have found an interesting "feature" in 2.1.129...2.2.0pre4. When I make
"cat /proc/1/cpu" as root, all goes fine. Doing the same as a user gives:
=== Cut ===
[ksi@nomad /]$ cat /proc/1/cpu
cat: /proc/1/cpu: Input/output error
=== Cut ===
Permissions of /proc/1/cpu are 0444, so it should be readable by anyone...
The same operation on a directory for a process owned by the user does
succeed.
What's going on and does anybody care to fix it?
