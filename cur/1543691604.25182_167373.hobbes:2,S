Did I really?
But the advantage of a good description is that the information
lives on the net and can be retrieved by anybody. A piece of
hardware takes room and can be tested by only one.
I think no kernel changes are required to use Japanese keyboards today.
(But kbd has to be recompiled with NR_KEYS set to 256.)

affairs. Maybe nothing more is needed. Of course additions
and corrections are welcome.
