Which reminds me.
Let me know if this "cheap 63bit atomic increment" works...
Increment:
    lock
    addl  $1,counter
    jo    0f
    jc    0f
.section .fixup,"ax"
0:  incl  counter+4
    jmp   1f
.previous
1:
Read:
    movl  counter+4,%edx
    lock
    addl  $0,(%esp)
    movl  counter,%eax
    cmpl  $0x80000000,%eax
    adcl  $0,%edx
    shrl  $1,%edx
Based on the observation that carry events are rare.
We can safely assume two never happen during the processor race windows.
enjoy,
