Hum... I would call that a user error.
If a thread is munmap()ing the vma that contains active futexes, result is 
undefined. Same as today I think (a thread blocked in a FUTEX_WAIT should 
stay blocked)
The point is that private futexes could be managed using virtual addresses, 
and no call to find_extend_vma(), hence no mmap_sem contention.
There could be problem if the same futex (32 bits integer) could be mapped at 
different virtual addresses in the same process.
