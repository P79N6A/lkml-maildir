I disagree with 1.  When one port has an attached device there won't be
any problem because suspends will never occur (since one port is active).
But I agree with 2.  So yes, it's probably safer to do a conditional 
suspend rather than a conditional resume.

Not suspending isn't really a big deal.  After all, we would suspend only 
when no devices are plugged in anyway.  Is the PIIX4 chipset used in 
laptops, where the power saving might be important?  That's the only 
reason I can think of for wanting to suspend whenever possible.
