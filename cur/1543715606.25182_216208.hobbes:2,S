This breaks modular builds - pcmcia_bus_type is in ds.c which is a
separate module.
Look, Dominik has done a fair amount of work in this area.  There is
a set of patches which need to be worked through and merged in a
controlled manner to get to the point where we can have a struct
device for PCMCIA cards.  We'll get there eventually.  Please don't
try to bypass this process - it won't work, and it'll only cause
unnecessary merge problems with the existing patch sets.
