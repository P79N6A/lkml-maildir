What happens when the suid-root bit is set by tar, cp and all the
others?
Also, what's wrong with exporting privileged binaries? We do that
already. That's why we have the nosuid option? The current setup gives
administrators the choice. Your scheme removes that, putting policy
back into the kernel (NFS won't support the cap bit).
