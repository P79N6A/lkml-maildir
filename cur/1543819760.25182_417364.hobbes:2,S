Van fell off the face of the planet after giving his presentation and
never published his code, only his slides.
I've started to make a slow attempt at implementing his ideas, nothing
but pure infrastructure so far, but you can look at what I have here:
	kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/vj-2.6.git
don't expect major progress and don't expect anything beyond a simple
channel to softint packet processing on receive any time soon.
Going all the way to the socket is a large endeavor and will require a
lot of restructuring to do it right, so expect this to take on the
order of months.
