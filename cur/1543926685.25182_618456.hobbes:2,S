In particular, you need a way to hold off the "real" application until 
disk reclaim is done.
If you do it purely in userspace (asynchronously) then it's subject to 
ENOSPC while the reclaimer runs.
This, by the way, has been discussed on and off -- often in the context 
of undelete (which is an identical problem.)  The problem usually is 
that performance of real storage users suffer because of locality 
issues.  However, flash storage doesn't have locality requirements...
