I like that, pull out the Hobby OS/small purpose card when it's convenient,
but a lot of the plans I see talked about for the kernel revolve around
features that are needed to support the type of applications that are being
stressed by Corporate America. That's where a significant amount of money
being poured (directly or indirectly) into linux right now, and that is
where the bulk of the next level of challenges in terms of kernel
development are going to come from. 
Linux is already a modern OS in most respects, the next logical programming
challenges are solving some of the vertical scaling issues, even as most of
these applications are moving in a growing trend toward scaling
horizontally.

Oh yeah, poor Corporate America. That what we should care most of.

Sorry Buddy. I am _not_ Corporate America.
I have 4 boxes at work and 5 boxes at home,
and only one of them can be safely run swapless. It's a router.
