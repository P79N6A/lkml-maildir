You got it ;)
Look at 
http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.2.5/.
Get the diskdev_cmds.tar.gz, plus a patch from Roman at
http://www.ardistech.com/hfsplus/diskdev_cmds.diff.gz.
With this, I built a fsck.hfsplus + mkfs.hfsplus. I have been using them
on USB flash drives and zip disks. No real test on a several Gb disk.
But I think they will work.
There is even the source from the 10.3.2 (Panther) version for the commands,
but the current patch from Ardistech page does not apply.
But you can have a real fsck and mkfs for hfsplus.
I think it is suitable for 2.6, but of course Roman Zippel has the last
word (and should update the patch for the Panther version, if possible...)
I would really like to see this in -mm or mainline ;). It helps moving
data around...no more VFAT for me.
Hope all this helps.
