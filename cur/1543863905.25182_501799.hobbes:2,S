Fortunately we do not care about out-of-tree drivers, which are most
affected, you may even call it a feature ^_^. My main problem is,
we can't refcount URBs, so usbmon can't tap them and must copy.
I understand that fw_transaction points to an external buffer while
SKB does not, so any jujumon code won't be able to refcount data.
So maybe it's not important.

Yes, this is what I mean. It serves well for our networking stack,
which is pretty fast. For some reason someone decided that USB users
should be let mapping their buffers. This led to big trouble with
usbmon, extra fields in URB (although already fat...), tying up precious
IOMMU resources (not so precious on x86, fortunately).

You know, I wanted to use this picture for a long time:

I hope it's all right.
I guess my problem is that I don't see just why the ORB transaction callback
is being delivered before the whole I/O was done.
Now that you drew my attention to sbp2_status_write(), this looks wrong:
        /* Lookup the orb corresponding to this status write. */
        spin_lock_irqsave(&card->lock, flags);
        list_for_each_entry(orb, &sd->orb_list, link) {
                if (status_get_orb_high(status) == 0 &&
                    status_get_orb_low(status) == orb->request_bus) {
                        list_del(&orb->link);
                        break;
                }
        }
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&card->lock, flags);
Why is it that fw_request can't carry a pointer?

If an IOMMU (or SWIOTLB) is not available, dma_map_single will fail.
If IOMMU is available, it will allocate a mapping so that DMA address
is constrained, failing if tables are full. At least this was my
understanding. However, I implemented that many years ago.

Please ask James, I do not remember that either.
For block layer, Jens guarantees it for you (it's controlled by
blk_queue_bounce_limit), but I am not sure about SCSI. I don't expect
it to have bounce buffers though.

I meant the replacement of the tests for zero with dma_mapping_error().

I challenge this claim. I am pretty sure that dma_unmap_single on a buffer
that wasn't mapped in the first place can cause havoc, primarily because
zero bus address can be valid.

Well, on SPARC we lived for years with a panic when IOMMU ran out and
nothing happened, so no biggie. It never happens. And when it does
you're dead anyway. Testing this is important in network drivers,
where the host can recover from running out of IOMMU.

I figured as much, but I don't know 1394 enough to be sure.

Yeah, repo is far smaller. Maybe I'm just so used to building
throwaway kernels for every test driver.
