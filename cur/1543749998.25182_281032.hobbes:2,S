Hi,
  In struct sk_buff (which is in the file
include/linux/skbuff.h), we can see the field unsigned
short security. I know its a security field for LSM,
and it says it is for security level of packet.
  Here, What does the security level of packet refer
to? Is it specified to a particular security model
(such as BLP)? and How can we use this field?
  Thank you.

Best Regards,
Park Lee
