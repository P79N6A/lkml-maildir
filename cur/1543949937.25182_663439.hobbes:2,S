Yes, this is an LVM issue with older userspace provided by some
distros, I think the dm code can notify the user about the problem, Kay
would know more.
The two distros I use here work just fine with this set to N :)
I have a patch queued up to change the wording of this config entry to
not say 2006, as that's not true anymore, and it should hopefully fix
some of the confusion here.
