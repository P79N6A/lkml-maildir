The reasons for pushing downloadable firmware out of the kernel are
manyfold and based on legal advice.
MORAL:  Many free software people like a clean separation between the
free and non-free components of a system
LEGAL:	Some firmware isn't publically redistributable but comes with the
h/w
LEGAL:	Several lawyers have advised people that putting firmware
separate to the kernel is different to embedding it in kernel in terms
of the derivative work question. 
TECHNICAL:  Unswappable blobs of kernel memory taken up by firmware is
bad generally speaking
TECHNICAL:  Pulling 20Mb of unchanging firmware each kernel tree is
annoying
