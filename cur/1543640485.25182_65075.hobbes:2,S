Having a stable ABI to user-space has been one of the strong points of
Linux, versus just about everything else out there. And I wouldn't be
using libc 5 if glibc wasn't growing exponentially with time (both in
terms of total bytes and in terms of number of shared libraries I have
to add to my link line).

It's not just me. There are people using libc 4.
