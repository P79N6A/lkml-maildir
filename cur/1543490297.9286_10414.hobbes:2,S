Hello all;
We seem to be having a problem while booting a Dell PowerEdge 6300
and it detecting the AIC7xxx SCSI Device. We are trying to install 
Debian 2.1. While the kernel is loading it either disconnects the 
video and hangs or it just reboots. In both cases it occurs
at the point where it should be probing for the SCSI devices.
We have tried with the default kernel (2.0.36) with & without the 
aic7xxx-5.1.12 patch all the way to kernel 2.2.2 with & without
the aic patch. 
Does anybody have any ideas?
thanks.
