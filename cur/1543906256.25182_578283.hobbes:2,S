Of course.

Oh, not introducing any syscalls _at all_ would be fine, too. But the
RFC does /require/ an implementation to have them. I was only mentioning
the kind of implementation the RFC had in mind. But there are other ways
to achieve the same end goal, and yes, probably it's better to avoid
introducing syscalls in the first place and think of other mechanisms.
[ It's not that we're talking of IPsec or IPv6 or something here --
  so RFC-compliance isn't overly important. But the final result
  needs to be good, secure and well-designed, still. ]
