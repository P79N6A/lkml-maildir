The only think I can think of is that because data structures
moved around we may be seeing some more cache misses.  If we
were talking normal interrupts taking a little longer I can
see my change having a direct correlation.  But I don't believe
I touched anything in that patch that touched the IPI path.
I did add some things to the per cpu area and expanded it a little
which may be what you are seeing.
That feels like a significant increase in fork times.  I will think
about it and holler if I can think of a productive direction to try.
My only partial guess is that it might be worth adding the per cpu
variables my patch adds without any of the corresponding code changes.
And see if adding variables to the per cpu area is what is causing the
change.
The two tests I can see in this line are:
- to add the percpu vector_irq variable.
- to increase NR_IRQs.
My suspicion is that one of those two changes alone will change
things enough that you see your lmbench slowdown.  If that is the
case then it is probably worth shuffling around the variables in the
per cpu area to get better cache line affinity.
