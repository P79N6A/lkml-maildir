OK, thanks for the clarification.

Well, if it's "interesting"...here are some more details from the box:

Huh. When I first saw this I thought "kernel bug" too, but then read the
documentation to Committed_AS I thought it's just userspace related...

Well, the box is running fine and since it's a production machine I don't 
intend to reboot the box very often. And since it's really an old kernel 
(for lkml discussion, that is) I don't intend to debug this one further. 
I really was only curious if this was userspace related (some app 
overcommitting) or some kernel weirdness.

I have:
# CONFIG_HUGETLBFS is not set
# CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE is not set
...was this, what you meant?
Thanks,
Christian.
