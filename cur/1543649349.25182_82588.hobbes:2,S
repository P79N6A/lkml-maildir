By that same argument, we should only have one directory containing all the
.c and .h files in the entire kernel source tree.
The files in drivers/media/video are _completely_ unrelated to
drivers/video.  If anything, drivers/video should become drivers/framebuffer,
which is what it really is.  This would get rid of the "video" confusion.
