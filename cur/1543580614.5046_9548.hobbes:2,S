I made up an new patch for 2.4.1. You can find it on
http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~Robert.Siemer/Private/
It works when:
a)  aci: module    miropcm20: module
b)  aci: build in  miropcm20: module
c)  aci: build in  miropcm20: build in
Violation to this table is still unchecked...
Arjan, I want to include your #ifdef solution, but was unable to find
it in 2.2.18... - And further: why did it remove somebody in 2.3.x?
Also (at least) in the case of c) videodev_init() is called twice. -
It does not hurt, but maybe someone can give me a hint why this
happens...
Ciao,
	Robert
