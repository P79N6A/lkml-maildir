They're superseded by iptables and their sole uses are by the Linux-
specific applications to manipulate this privileged aspect of system
state. This makes a much weaker case for backward compatibility than
general nonprivileged standardized system calls.

This does not advance the argument.

The ``stable'' moniker and distros being based on 2.4 are horrors
beyond imagination and developers are pushed to in turn push
inappropriate features on 2.4.x and maintain them out-of-tree for
2.4.x
