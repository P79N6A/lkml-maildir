Maybe because you run patched LILO which works around this 2.6.x
brokeness. Debian's #221967 says that 'reset disk subsystem' should
stop floppy motor. I'd like to see this black on white...
Fortunately Andreas Roland accepted patch instead of reassigning
bug to 2.6.x kernel package where it belongs - if kernel does
not pass timer IRQ to the BIOS, it is kernel's responsibility
to do tasks which BIOS scheduled for future...
lilo (1:22.5.8-6) unstable; urgency=low
  * Now LILO can disable FDC on (weird?) BIOS using 2.6 kernel.
    (closes: #221967)
