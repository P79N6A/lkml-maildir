You are wanting to load a driver for a completely-hotplug-capable 
subsystem but treat as if it was not? What will your package do if the 
user does not have the keyboard plugged in when the module gets loaded?
IMHO you should use the hotplug infrastructure and do this properly; 
load the module, and then sleep/wait until you get a hotplug event 
telling you that a keyboard has been found.
