 It's not completely OK to write 1 to cr4.pce as you get a GP fault if a
CPU does not support it.  However, you may handle the exception yourself
and enable rdpmc unconditionally, i.e. with no feature test (Intel states
cr4.pce is model-specific anyway) -- hopefully no vendor overloads the
cr4.pce bit.
