Does this already include the s390 kernel team? We are definitely
interested in this. Note that we already have one (rather limited)
solution for memory unplug in arch/s390/mm/cmm.c, but this is far
from real memory hotplug and uses an architecture feature that is
probably not available anywhere else.
