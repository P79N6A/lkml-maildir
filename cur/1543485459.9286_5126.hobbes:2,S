Hello,
Are there any folks interested in support for SCO AFS/EAFS filesystems ?
I have a preliminary patch for SysV FS driver with AFS/EAFS support, but 
I can't test it due to lack of appropriate file system images. Does any-
body have access to SCO Open Server 5 and would be able to do a couple
of floppy images with appropriate filesystems ?
[ side note: donation of cdrom with an evaluation version of Open Server
             would help even more. That would allow me to play with its
             disklabel support. ]
Unfortunately due to local problems I can't put the patch on the web,
so if you would like to do some testing or whatever drop me a note.
Cheers,
Kris
