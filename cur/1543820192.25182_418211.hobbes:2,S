Also, on 2.6.17-rc2, if I do a hexdump of the PCI config space for the
RADEON 7000 via sysfs once Linux boots, it still says the ROM is located
at ff8c0000, even though I get this message during boot:
PCI: pbus will assign resource 0000:01:0c.0
PCI: assigning resource #6 for 0000:01:0c.0 (start 0)
  got res [c6900000:c691ffff] bus [c6900000:c691ffff] flags 7200 for BAR 6 of
0000:01:0c.0
The first two lines of that bit from dmesg are from extra printks I put
in the for loop at the end of pbus_assign_resources_sorted and at the
top of pci_assign_resource.
The Promise controller's PCI config space says it's at c6920000.
