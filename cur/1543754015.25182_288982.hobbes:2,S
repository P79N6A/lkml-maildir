Just a small followup to say that this series of patches still applies to 
2.6.11-rc2 (the first one with a little fuzzyness though). If wanted I can 
re-diff these against 2.6.11-rc2.
If I get no feedback (have had none so far) I'll wait until 2.6.11 is out 
the door, then re-diff and re-submit against that.
