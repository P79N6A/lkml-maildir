You could use the MTD block driver with on the phram device
by simply specifying the address/size of the memory as a module
parameter.  If you need autodetection, the easiest way to do that
would be including the phram MTD driver in your pci device driver.
If you are completely stuck on 2.4.22, it might be easier to
use the old slram driver instead of phram, but generally you
should try to hack on a modern kernel level like 2.6.10 anyway.
