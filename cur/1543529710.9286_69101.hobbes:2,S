You want to buy a $20M computer and then avoid $1M in porting costs and
you don't care about performance. Odd.
Buy a $1M computer, make your code use MPI for $2M, and spend $5M on
fast switches. Lower cost, higher performance. Or buy a real SMP machine
for $20M.
Or maintain DSM outside the base Linux kernel. And God bless you.
