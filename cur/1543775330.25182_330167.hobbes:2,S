It is spelt "weird"
Looks basically OK although it would be good to document the situation
for a bus mastering DMA controller. Does the device have to reconfigure
the DMA on a resume or is that something the restore code for the device
should handle ?
My own feeling is tha we should dump that on the device (safer) and also
expect the device to prevent suspends during an active DMA transfer (eg
floppy)
