Yes, but that lumps all three together.  init_waitqueue_head() is obviously
the porky one.  And it's porkier with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK and
CONFIG_LOCKDEP, which isn't the case to optimise for.
With the debug options turned off, even init_waitqueue_head() becomes just
three assignments, similar to init_waitqueue_entry() and
init_waitqueue_func_entry().  All pretty marginal.
