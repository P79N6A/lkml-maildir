Thankfully osdl has been set up with very useful fields for such things. 
It sounds like cases that you are describing should be rejected with a 
status of either "UNREPRODUCIBLE" if the bug report was decently done, 
but you can't reproduce it, or "INSUFFICIENT_DATA" if the bug report was 
filed inadequately. This can serve as a prompt to the original filer to 
re-open it with better data.
I don't think you should hesitate to do that at least once for a bug 
fits either of those cases.
