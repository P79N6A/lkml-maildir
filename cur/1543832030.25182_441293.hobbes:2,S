Subject: [PATCH] pi-futex: Validate futex type instead of oopsing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/6/309

Calling futex_lock_pi is called with a reference to a non PI futex and
waiters exist already, lookup_pi_state() oopses due to pi_state == NULL.
Check this condition and return -EINVAL to userspace.
