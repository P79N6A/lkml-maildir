I experience strange problem with 2.4.18-pre7 and latest version (-J9) of the 
O(1) scheduler. After one or two days of uptime, I get hanged shells, when 
trying to execute ps, top and similar things. I saw some mention from Ingo 
about 'frozen shells' before, but I didn't find anything more detailed about 
that. Is this problem a known "feature" already ? I had this problem with 
prior versions of O(1) patches too.
