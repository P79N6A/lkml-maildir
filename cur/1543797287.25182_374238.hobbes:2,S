pci_to_acpi is already implemented in the PCI layer (see 
drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c), with struct device.firmware_data being where 
the acpi_handle ends up. I guess there's no problem in moving my code 
out to scsi-acpi.c and adding an arch_initcall for it. Would that be 
more acceptable? The only problem then is working out a clean way of 
setting up the notification structure.
