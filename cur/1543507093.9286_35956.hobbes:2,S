Hello,
  I just thought I would send this to the kernel list
so people could be aware of a small problem in the
TCQ code in refrence to the aic7xxx driver. The code
now turns on TCQ by default and moves around in
scsi.c the location of the probeing of the harddrives.
Well I have Western Digital Enterprise drives
and this process forces the scsibus into a 
cyclic reset. I went into scsi_obsolete.c and
discovered that RESET2 never got called. I also
tried passing in the kernel options but I think
the scsi.c still probes and then decides how
many TCQ the user wanted verses the hardware. My only solution
at this point was to roll out every patch that
2.2.11 had in the drivers/scsi directory. I tried
rolling out just the aic7xxx patches but it didn't help.
Anybody know if anyone is working on this?
