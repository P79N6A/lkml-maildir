It's from an intermediate state of my attempt to rewrite the irda ldisc
(irtty) to make it working with the new serial driver and usbserial as
well. It's all working with serial (uart) which doesn't sleep neither in
write_room() nor write() - except when called from userland.
With usbserial however port->sem is acquired in both cases. It gets
invoked from non-sleep context in two cases:
1) start of transmission (frame comes from network layer):
	netdev->hard_start_xmit() - under xmit-lock
		- takes some spinlock_bh to serialize with write_wakeup()
		- calls tty_driver->write_room() and tty_driver->write()
2) sending more data after serial driver has transmitted some bytes:
	tty_driver in bh context (urb-complete for usbserial)
	calls ldisc->write_wakeup()
		which uses tty_driver->write_room() / write()
		to send the next few bytes from the frame
The backtrace below is from case 1. In both cases it would be extremely
painful to defer all the real work to process context - then we could as
well nuke write_wakeup() and write_room() and make tty_driver->write()
just blocking.
Agreed, there aren't many users of write_wakeup but it seems they all rely
on case 2 above (at least): ppp, n_hdlc, slip, x25, input/serio to give a
few examples. Well, they are probably always used on top of serial without
problem - but I'd expect the same issue might already hit bluetooth (i.e.
hci_ldisc) when running over usbserial.

Given the above mentioned observations with other write_wakeup() users I
tend to assume my approach to call write_room()/write() from non-sleep
context couldn't be that wrong. And it works with existing serial driver
(old and new one).
Another question/suggestion: do we need to acquire port->sem in usbserial?
Couldn't this be done with a spinlock - at least when called from_user?
If we agree serial drivers shouldn't sleep in write_room()/write() my
impression is this needs to be addressed somehow, regardless whether
usbserial uses the new serial core or not. Anybody tried this with a
bluetooth dongle over usbserial?
