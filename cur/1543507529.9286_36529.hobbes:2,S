I tried it this morning and it worked fine ftp'ing about 80 Meg of files 
across a 10baseT network (without Alan's fix).  Also as I mentioned in my 
previous message, I can copy from an IDE drive on the system fine, but not the 
IDE CD.  I wish I had another CD-ROM drive to try but I don't my other one 
went bad a while back.  If it's a timing problem I guess it's plausible that 
both the net and the CD on your machine could trigger it, while only the CD 
does so on mine (so far), but I'm no expert by a long shot.
Thanks for your reply!
