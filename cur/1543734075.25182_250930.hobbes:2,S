It would be really really nice to get AMD64 down to 4K stacks. The
bigger sizes of stack frames may make that harder for current big 
stack users. The pain/gain ratio isn't so sweet as with x86 down to
4K.
Also the x86 one really didnt change anything. AMD64 has IRQ stacks
while x86 did not. That meant in practical terms anything using > 4K
was eventually going to go bang
