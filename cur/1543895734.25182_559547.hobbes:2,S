I thought Paul had seen the same problem with 2.6.21.5. I will try a
more recent mainline (2.6.22-rc5 maybe) after I get hold of the problem
machine and report later today.
If there is any difference, it should be because of the reported topology
by low-level platform code. In the problem case, each CPU was being reported
to be a separate node (CONFIG_NUMA enabled) which caused idle_balance()
to stop load-balance lookups at cpu/node level itself.
