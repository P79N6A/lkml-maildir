Please be aware that not all filesystems treat directories as sequential
files, filled with with odd sized records.  Some directories are distributed
across the entire file system and the d_off fields really contain the
address on disk of the next entry in the directory.  The d_off field is 
really
just a cookie and is not meant to be interpreted as an offset into the
directory.  The lseek() system call is used, but only because that was a
handy way of positioning the pointer into the directory.  It is unfortunate
that the getdents(2) system call was not defined with a cookie as one of
its arguments to indicate where to start fetching entries from.  This would
have reduced the confusion about treating directories as files or not.
    Thanx...
