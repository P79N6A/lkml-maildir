This does seem to be the case - from an FAQ that H J Lu posted about that time:
| From: hlu@yoda.eecs.wsu.edu (H.J. Lu)
| Subject: FAQ about gcc (how to compile program under Linux)
| Date: Sun, 19 Jul 92 06:40:05 GMT

| Another file, XXXXinc.tar.Z, where XXXX is the current version number
| of Linux kernel, has all the header files to replace the header files 
| from kernel. YOU MUST INSTALL IT. Please read README for details.
There is some mention of a "GCC channel" where new linux GCC releases got
discussed:
|                       If you want to use the testing release, first
| join the GCC channel on the Linux mailing list, and then send a note to
| hlu@eecs.wsu.edu.
Does anyone know if there's an archive available for that ancient list?
Maybe we can find some discussion WRT errno.h there.
