I think that we then have two distinct problems: 1) finding a solution for 2.4
that does not change userspace 2) finding a solution for 2.5/2.6 that is
Right.
Personally I'm not sure what 2.4 stands to gain from a redesign. While 2.4
is obviously developing, a stable series needs to solve real problems or
improve performance - I know the way major numbers are allocated right now
is ugly and doesn't scale very well. But is 2.4 the place to fix that?
So the question is: does this new policy hold for 2.4 as well and if so,
why.
