I've explained why this occurs in bugzilla - but for the sake of
repeating repeating repeating myself at great length, let's repeat
it again here.
The serial layer does _not_ have access to the "current" termios
settings due to the layering by the tty subsystem.  If the serial
port being used by serial console has been opened once by the user,
but is closed at the moment when a suspend/resume cycle occurs,
the serial layer and lower level drivers do not have access to the
baud rate.
Hence, it is impossible for the serial layer to do a proper resume
in this scenario.  Either always suspend with the console port open
or never open the console port before suspend.  Alternatively, we
need the tty layer to mature, so that there is some way for drivers
to get the termios structures for the console from the upper layer.
Or maybe we need the tty layer to be responsible for implementing
suspend/resume support for tty devices.
