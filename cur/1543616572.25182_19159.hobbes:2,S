What do you mean with this? Explain, please!

The problem I had is the following: I make all of my linux binaries
myself but I have also some older machines here that have a k6 or a
pentium. For mistake I installed the wrong rpm and had a non working
system. An emulation for such cases would be a _real_ feature at least
more than a pinguin boot logo (if one uses the framebuffer console).
I think a stable and possible self correcting [1] system should be the aim
of a modern OS. Maybe I will have a look on implementing the emulation
but I thought I'll find someone here who has done this already (or is
willing to do so).

[1] This means catching most or all errors and correct them as good as
    possible. Only a running system is a good system. ;-)
