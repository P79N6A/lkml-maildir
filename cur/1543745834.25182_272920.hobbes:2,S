Hi,
currently my DVD player sounds like a jet plane when playing ordinary 
audio CD's. I tried the different approaches to lowering playback speed 
that are commonly used (hdparm, setspeed, etc) but none of them worked.
Then I found this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=99366299900003&r=1&w=2
Which seems to indicate that DVD players need a different command 
(SET_STREAMING), the thread is from 2001, and I've not been able to find 
any more recent information.
So, my question is, is this implemented in the kernel and are there any 
userspace tools to set the playback speed?
Regards,
David
