yup.  root can damage the system in all sorts of ways.

Well...  the problem is that if we add a safety net to catch run-away
SCHED_FIFO processes, we've permanently degraded the service which we
provide to well-behaved programs.
Should there be a watchdog which checks for a process which has run
realtime for a certain period and which then takes some action?  Such as
descheduling it for a while, generating warnings, demoting its policy,
killing it etc?
