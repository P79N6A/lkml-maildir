"multiple repeated infractions" might not be required.
I remember one case in Germany where offering 272 songs in a P2P network 
once resulted in a fine based on criminal law. [1]
Convictions under civil law seem to be easier and result in higher costs 
for the copyright violators, so the music industry tends to use the 
reportings of offences in Germany only for getting the names of the 
people from the IP addresses they have (happened in a five digit number 
of cases), don't care about whether the criminal law cases proceed, and 
focus on the civil law cases.
But if you are doing more than just filesharing, or even make a profit 
out of it, the maximum penalties go up to 5 years in jail...
