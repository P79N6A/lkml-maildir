Hi Eric,
I tried recompiling the kernel per your instructions, but I got a
failure here:
          CC [M]  drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.o
        drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c: In function ‘mpt_resume’:
        drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c:1526: warning: ignoring return value of ‘pci_enable_device’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result
          CC [M]  drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.o
        drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c: In function ‘mptscsih_initTarget’:
        drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c:2691: error: ‘lun’ undeclared (first use in this function)
        drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c:2691: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
        drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.c:2691: error: for each function it appears in.)
        make[4]: *** [drivers/message/fusion/mptscsih.o] Error 1
        make[3]: *** [drivers/message/fusion] Error 2
        make[2]: *** [drivers/message] Error 2
        make[1]: *** [drivers] Error 2
Did I do something wrong?
Regards,
Justin
