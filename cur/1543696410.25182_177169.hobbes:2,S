What do you mean?  DEVPATH is unique for that point in time.  There are
no alias's in sysfs.

The /sys entry is probably already removed, but if not, it will
disappear any second.  So no, it's not safe to try to access it, as it
will not work.

What "device number"?  The major/minor?  Why?  It's about as unique as
DEVPATH is for any point in time.
