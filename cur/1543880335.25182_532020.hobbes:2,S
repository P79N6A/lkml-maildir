Biba and BLP are only incompatible if they are using the same label, if 
each object has a confidentiality and integrity label they work fine 
together (as well as MLS systems work in general that is). Type 
enforcement, however, lets you accomplish both integrity and 
confidentiality (though not easily hierarchal confidentiality*). Take a 
mail client for example, I could argue that my mail is confidential so I 
label it my_mail_t and only give access to my mail client to read it and 
the MTA to write it. Further I limit access of my mail client to objects 
that can reduce its integrity such as untrusted files in /tmp, less 
trusted user home directories and so on. Despite AA advocate claims that 
info flow doesn't matter to integrity it does. I must be able to see 
what can write to objects that my mail client can read if I want to make 
any claims about its integrity.
* hierarchal confidentiality is obtained with an additional BLP label 
that is evaluated as set of constraints over the type enforcement 
permissions. SELinux is extensible in this way where AA is not.

This would be combining two bad systems to get a worse one IMO. 
Capability systems are inherently discretionary since propagated 
capabilities must be removed at the discretion of the possessor of the 
capabilities.
The argument that labels are not practical has yet to be shown but is 
thrown around as if it is fact. Path based systems are inferior to label 
based systems based if for no other reason than path based systems can't 
control transient objects. With policy based type transition in SELinux 
when my ssh client writes my agent socket to /tmp/ssh-xxxxxxxxxx SELinux 
calculates a type transition based off my domain to label it 
sysadm_ssh_t (or whatever is appropriate) whereas path based systems 
can't possibly control access to these objects. The same goes for any 
files written to home directories by user apps.

Once again, this creates a discretionary system that would not work 
without modifying every single application that uses such authority (and 
trusting the code is bug free so that it does the right thing) and gives 
you an inflexible, decentralized, unmaintainable, unanalyzable policy 
since it is distributed throughout code all over the system, you give 
users no way to change the security characteristics of the system.
