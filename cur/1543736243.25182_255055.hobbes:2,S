Well, first of all I think you should just submit a patch to add dummyphp and not
removing fakephp in the same step. Also you somehow mis-copied the patch to
your mail app - most (not all) tabs are converted to one space (or is it just
thunderbird displaying the mail?). Can you resend it? Then I'll give it a try.
Greg wrote in another mail that the 'proper' way of 'powering up' device slots should
be to rescan the entire bus. I don't know, your approach certainly seems easier, but you
are bound to either display all pci slots which may come to live or just the ones
in the system already, which means you cannot rescan slots which weren't equipped
on boot up. So perhaps adding a rescan method to fakephp is indeed cleaner.
