Okay... currently, we are passing u32 down the drivers. Some pieces
interpret it as a PCI state, and some pieces interpret it as a system
state. We really do want system state to go down to the drivers, so
they can do different thing on reboot vs. just-before-suspend-to-disk
etc.
Now, Patrick has some plans with device power managment and they
included something bigger being passed down to the drivers. I wanted
to prepare for those plans.
I can replace suspend_state_t with enum system_state, but it might
mean that enum system_state will have to be extended with things like
RUNTIME_PM_PCI_D0 in future... I guess that's easiest thing to do. It
solves all the problems we have *now*.
