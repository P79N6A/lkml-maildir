Before .99-pre4 (ish), there was a deadlock which kicked in more or less
instantly (related to tq_disk). Disabling plugging on loop cured that, but
there are still ways to make it deadlock pretty quickly. Booting with mem=8m
and running iozone -a on an ext2-backed loop device dies pretty quickly for
me.
