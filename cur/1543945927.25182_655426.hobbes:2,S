I know it is a real bad assumption. However, the RIO initial ID is only
transported to
 driver by kernel parameter "riohdid", which can not distinguish the
multi
 rio controllers. It may be more better add a "rio-id" property in RIO
dts node, but
 the u-boot need some changes to support the rio-id assignment.
Cheers!
Wei.
