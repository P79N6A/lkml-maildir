Thanks for the response.
I looked at the code, and there doesn't seem to be a way to turn it off
dynamically or with a bootline option.  I have to have the driver
compiled into the kernel (because I'm netbooting with NFS) so I can't
really use a module parameter.
A dynamic field in /proc would be quite nice.
