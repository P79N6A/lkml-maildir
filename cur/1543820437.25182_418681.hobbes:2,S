Subject: [PATCH 00/02] Process Events - Header Cleanup and License Change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
	This series of patches cleans up the Process Events header in
include/linux/cn_proc.h in the first patch and then changes the license
of cn_proc.h to LGPL in the second patch. As copyright holders to the
work the header was derived from (mentioned at the top of the header) I
think Guillaume Thouvenin and Nguyen Anh Quynh should sign-off or [n]ack
the second patch before it can go in.
	Please consider applying these to -mm.
Thanks,
	-Matt Helsley <matthltc@us.ibm.com>
