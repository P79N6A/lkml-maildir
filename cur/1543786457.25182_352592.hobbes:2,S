Personally I think working to get the sysfs support finished in
bonding and stop relying on module parameters to configure bonds would
be better, since bonds will truly be independent of each other and be
able to be added and removed on the fly.  Having worked with a
previous attempt to set per-bond values through module parameters
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=110558187800001&r=1&w=2), it's easy
to get pretty crazy.  For example, you can have more than one
arp_ip_target, and they really should be per bond as well, so how do
you divvy those up via module parameters?
