This is where it started going wrong. I did not expect add_active_range() 
to be called with overlapping PFNs so they were not getting merged. If 
they were getting merged correctly, I'd expect the output to be
add_active_range(0, 0, 4096): New
add_active_range(0, 0, 131072): Merging forward
add_active_range(0, 0, 131072): Merging forward
add_active_range(0, 393216, 523264): New
add_active_range(0, 393216, 523264): Merging forward
add_active_range(0, 393216, 524288): Merging forward
add_active_range(0, 393216, 524288): Merging forward

And here is where it goes BLAM. Without the debugging patch, the check is 
just;
BUG_ON(prev_end_pfn > start_pfn);
The error I was *expecting* to catch was an unsorted node map. It's just 
nice it caught this situation as well. It'll take a while to fix this up 
properly.
Thanks
