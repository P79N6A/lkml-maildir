The tickless system differs from VST in that it is designed to only "tick" when 
there is something in the time list to do and it does this ALWAYS.  The VST 
notion is that ticks are not needed if the cpu is idle.  This is VASTLY simpler 
to do than a tickless system because, mostly, the accounting requirements.  When 
a VST cpu is not ticking, the full sleep time is charged to the idle task and 
the system does not need to time slice or do any time driven user profiling or 
execution limiting.
And this is exactly where the tickless system runs into overload.  Simply 
speaking, each task has with it certain limits and requirements WRT time.  It is 
almost always time sliced, but it may also have execution limits and settimer 
execution time interrupts that it wants.  These need to be set up for each task 
when it is switched to and removed when the system switches away from it.  In 
the test I did, I reduced all these timers to one (I think I just used the slice 
time, but this is not the thing to do if the user is trying to do profiling.  In 
any case, only one timer needs to be set up, possibly some work needs to be done 
to find the min. of all the execution time timers it has, but only that one 
needs to go in the time list.).  BUT it needs to happen each context switch time 
and thus adds overhead to the switch time.  In my testing, the overhead for this 
became higher than the ticked system overhead for the same services at a 
relatively low context switch rate.  From a systems point of view, you just 
don't want to increase overhead when the load goes up.  This leads to fragile 
systems.

Now, the question still remains, if a cpu in an SMP system is sleeping because 
of VST, who or how is it to be wakened to responded to increases in the system 
load.  If all CPUs are sleeping, there is some event (i.e. interrupt) that does 
this.  I think, in an SMP system, any awake CPUs should, during their load 
balancing, notice that there are sleeping CPUs and wake them as the load increases.
