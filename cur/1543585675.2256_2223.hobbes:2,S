I.e., kill innocent processes which try to increase their memory usage just
at the wrong moment. This is exactly what happened before the OOM-killer...

Just too bad there is no complete accounting for memory usage in the kernel
right now (a lot of complex data structures in kernel do consume varying
amounts of memory, not always in the name of a specific process; much of
the extra flexibility in later kernels is exactly because some structures
aren't static anymore). Say good-bye to modules, you could as well have
everything under the sun built in (as the memory for each possible module
will have to be assumed in use, just in case).

They just get killed for requesting memory at the wrong moment, which is a
lot worse.

Can we please remember that OOM is *not* in any way a "normal system state"
that has to be handled in a civilized, orderly way? This is just an escape
route in case everything else has failed.
