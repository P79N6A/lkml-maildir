Hmmmm.....
    SO someone finally realized that HT is not being detected properly dispite all the boot time parameters in the lilo/grub with APIC turned on?  It just seems to be a major problem since 2.4.21 version and I was hoping it was resolved. :)
    This patch you mentioned, can you send a copy to me as well?  Just want to get my clients off my back. :)
