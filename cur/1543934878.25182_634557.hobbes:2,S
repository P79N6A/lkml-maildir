There are two issues here:
* set_bit()/test_bit() are atomic operations and they don't see to be
  necessary in case of ide-floppy.c (standard '|'/'&' should be enough)
* using wrappers for these operations is not a bad idea but doing it _now_
  just makes it harder for us to figure out how to introduced common ATA
  Packet command interface for all ATAPI device drivers (the other drivers
  are using very similar flag handling and flag names currently)
so I would say that we should defer introducting these wrappers for now
(patch converting set_bit()/test_bit() to '|'/'&' would still be welcomed).

fixes for comments look fine but they should be merged with the other
patch (the one containing checkpatch.pl/comments fixes)
Thanks,
