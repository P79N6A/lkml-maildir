It only changes things if you configure it on, and you are correct that
many other drivers feed the entropy pool if so. That is, indeed, the whole
point of the patch.

There is a leap of logic in the last sentence I don't understand. Stable
(or rather release) kernels are supposed to behave predictably. Behaviour
dependent upon NIC is not predictable. Behaviour dependent upon a config
option (which does 'exactly what it says on the tin') is predictable.
Stable/release series are meant to have bugs fixed. Please tell me why
having 3 NIC cards behave one way, and the rest behaviour another is
/not/ a bug. Stable kernels are meant to be functional and secure. Robert's
patch allows the user both/either, in situations where the previous
kernel could be either dysfunctional (insufficient entropy) or arguably
potentially insecure (theoretical possibility of external manipulation
of entropy source).
