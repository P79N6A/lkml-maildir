"quite unlikely" ...
Hmmm just how fast are you driving the clocks on your ppc?  Even at 100GHz
It is almost SIX YEARS between wrap-arounds of a 64-bit counter.
Perhaps you could just have a cron job that forces a call to update_wall_time()
every January 1st, rather than add extra code overhead to a hot path :-) ?
But I agree that narrower counters are a problem.
