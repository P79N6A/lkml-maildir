I have been testing 2.5.75-mm1.  I was able to cause video skip in xine,
but not audio.  I will repeat the tests using test1-mm1.  Anyone else
seen the video-only type skip?  It appears to be caused by other GUI
operations, not so much by CPU load.  Just dragging windows is not enough,
it needs to be more intensive than that.
More results later with test1-mm1
Thanks for all the great stuff!!
