Good, that's how I understood it as well.
But the locking is certainly a mess as-is in the QStor driver.
Sure, it is actually all technically correct, but hard to follow.
I believe I can remove nearly all of it and really tidy things up
as a result.
Thanks guys, this has been really helpful so far.
