Thanks for alerting me about that, I'll take that into consideration.

The fixes you've posted in the last weeks are merged in my tree.
However, I don't think that this particular problem has anything
to do with NCQ. In the last 2 hours I've tested a few different 
versions:
 * 2.6.16.1 with its sata_mv and the "three bug fixes" update. 
 * 2.6.16.1 + sata_mv 0.6 from 2.6.16-git back-ported.
 * 2.6.16 + ncq + modified sata_mv 0.6 (includes some changes
   I've posted before along with your fixes).
All versions show the same problem. The system in question has
two 6081 controllers and 14 disks.
My guess it that sata_mv leaves the controllers in a unclean
state and I'm now looking into this problem to see how it can
be fixed.

I'll look forward to these patches, thanks.
