Ok.  It will take some digging but I suspect the problem is
that video.S is using a table or a variable placed over the original
boot sector, and expecting it to be zero initialized. 
Finding that in the pile of 2000 lines of assembly could take a
little while.
Now at least we have something other people can try and reproduce
this problem with.
