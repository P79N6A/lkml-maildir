Subject: [PATCH][PPC64] Don't clear MSR.RI in do_hash_page_DSI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some code that is used on iSeries (do_hash_page_DSI in head.S) was
clearing the RI (recoverable interrupt) bit in the MSR when it
shouldn't.  We were getting SLB miss interrupts following that which
were panicking because they appeared to have occurred at a bad place.
This patch fixes the problem.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Paul.
