Something like this?
  rcu_read_lock();
  list_for_each_rcu(p, ...) {
    ptr = list_entry(p, struct ..., list);
    /* Grab a reference to "ptr". */
    rcu_read_unlock();
    my_task_that_may_sleep(ptr);
    rcu_read_lock();
    /* Drop a reference to "ptr". */
  }
  rcu_read_unlock();
Regarding my case, memory region pointed by "ptr" never be removed.
Do I need to grab a reference to "ptr" ?
Regards.
