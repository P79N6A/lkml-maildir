Hello,

I had problems with keyboard (not PS/2) too, unfortunately they
are not reproducible. The failure mode is basically:
- I reboot using ctrl-alt-del
- The keyboard is dead during the boot - the ESC does not
  interrupt the memory check, no input to LILO possible etc.
- Linux booting process does not correct the situation
- Hard reset (even during the memory check) brings the kbd
  back to normal
This is QDI Commander PPro mainboard and 6+ years old
Chicony keyboard. The keyboard had its own problems
in the past, but 10 minutes with the soldering iron
resolved them :-)
The first time it happened was some late 2.1.x and appr.
4 times since then. It did not happened at any other
occassion as the reboot. As this is very rare situation,
I have no idea, whether kbd-reset kernel option helps.
Regards
