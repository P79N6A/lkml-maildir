How do you find a random block in the page cache?  Last my
understanding was that the page cache is organized by inode/offset,
which wouldn't lend itself to looking up a random hardware block.
(Not to mention the fact that the filesystem is perfectly allowed not
to present anything like a coherent state to the disk while mounted,
which means that even if you did a snapshot in time you're not
guaranteed to have anything functional.  I understand this can be done
by sending a "quiet point" command to the filesystems, followed by an
LVM snapshot, but I doubt may people do that!
