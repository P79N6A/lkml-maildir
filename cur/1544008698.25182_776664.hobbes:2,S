I just went straight to trying downgrading the driver and the older driver
indeed works fine.  Then I tried to narrow down the problem and the lucky
winner this time is the cute (== undocumented and unsigned-off) patch
called radeon-6.9.0-remove-limit-heuristics.patch.  The newer driver with
only this patch reverted fixes hangs for vanilla kernels and drm errors
for Fedora kernel.  Also performance problems that I've noticed in the
meantime (slower playback of 720p videos, sluggish window scrolling in
kmail) are completely gone.  That being said I'm not entirely sure whether
the patch introduced the bug or it was only the trigger for it...
FWIW I've noticed that the patch seems to change the allocation+layout of
memory used by the driver:

PS Since I was busy with debugging the problem I haven't noticed that you
have released the new driver package (xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-59.fc10),
however since it still contains the patch in question I don't think that
it would help (anyway I'll test it tomorrow, I'm too tired now)...
