How far from wise is it to compile the 2.4.19-prex
kernel with gcc3.1?  Is there a list of known issues?
Only report of trouble I've seen so far is
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=linux.kernel.5.1.0.14.2.20020515015506.02749780
%40pop.cus.cam.ac.uk
and that's just a compile-time fatal error building ntfs.
