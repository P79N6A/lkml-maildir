There a two scenarios, where you don't have full control over the i2c 
adapter or you don't want to fully isolate the bus:
1) Some dvb drivers are bttv-sub-drivers, ie. bttv does the pci and i2c 
handling by itself. You have the struct i2c_adapter pointer, but it has 
been registered by bttv, most likely as an analog and/or digital tv i2c bus.
2) Embedded platforms have usually a system-wide i2c bus, so you cannot 
isolate the bus here.
It's useful to register both adapters and drivers to the i2c-core, so 
you keep the door open.

Partly, yes.
The .class approach is necessary to have a finer grained access control 
by the i2c-core regarding bus classes, ie. not the client drivers have 
to check if the bus should be probed (for example dcc drivers on a dvb 
bus). This is useful in general.
If we have a PCI card where we exactly know what we are doing, we can 
use the NO_PROBE flag to effectively block any probing and can use the 
proposed interface to manually connect the clients.
