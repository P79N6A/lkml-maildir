Subject: Possible regression: MSI vector leakage since 2.6.18-rc5ish (Unable to repeatedly allocate/free MSI interrupt)

Hi,
I've established a regression in the MSI vector/irq allocation routine for both 
i386 and x86_64. Our test labs repeatedly modprobe/rmmod the e1000 driver for 
serveral minutes which allocates msi vectors and frees them. These tests have 
been running fine until 2.6.19.
git-bisecting I've established that in between commit 
04b9267b15206fc902a18de1f78de6c82ca47716 "Eric W. Biederman -- genirq: x86_64 
irq: Remove the msi assumption that irq == vector" and commit 
f29bd1ba68c8c6a0f50bd678bbd5a26674018f7c "Ingo Molnar -- genirq: convert the 
x86_64 architecture to irq-chips" the behaviour broke.
The revisions in between seem to be dependent and give all sorts of other 
issues, so it's rather hard for me to bisect that and give trustworthy results.
the e1000 driver hits the 256-mark cycle (I think - it consistently refuses to 
do 500 msi irq/vector allocations which is my test case) and throws:
e1000: eth4: e1000_request_irq: Unable to allocate MSI interrupt Error: -16
which is caused by a `if ((err = pci_enable_msi(adapter->pdev))) {` call from 
the e1000 driver. It's rather easy to hit this mark with the new 4-port e1000 
adapters :).
as for the e1000 code, I can say that even our oldest msi-enabled e1000 driver 
works fine with 2.6.18 and under. All kernels from 2.6.19 fail consistently.
I mostly suspect commit 7bd007e480672c99d8656c7b7b12ef0549432c37 at the moment. 
Perhaps Eric Biederman can help?
Cheers,
Auke

PS After the msi enable fails, things go horribly wrong (of course...) if we 
still try to disable+enable more new msi interrupts, but this may just be the 
e1000 driver cleanup missing something. perhaps it's relevant:

which repeats ad infinitum... perhaps this rings some bells for someone.
