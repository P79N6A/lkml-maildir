There appears to be a dud raid patch in -mm.  It'll be one of the md-*
patches.
If you have time, could you work out which one?  Ones to start with might be
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.2-rc1/2.6.2-rc1-mm3/broken-out/md-02-preferred_minor-fix.patch
and
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.2-rc1/2.6.2-rc1-mm3/broken-out/md-06-allow-partitioning.patch
