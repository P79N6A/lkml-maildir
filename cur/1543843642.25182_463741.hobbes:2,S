We don't -- at least *I* wouldn't care, but I'm not the current
maintainer. ltt's usefulness has always been in the digested information
it can present to the user. The kernel patching part was a necessary
evil. What I object to is the depiction of dynamic tracing as solving
the need for static markup. I doesn't, and, therefore, does not
currently constitute an adequate substitute for ltt's patches. If
someone else can actually provide ltt with the events and surround
detail (timestamping and all) it needs while still providing the same
performance we currently get out of the current ltt patches, then I'd
say more power to them -- the current developers may how more relevant
things to say.
