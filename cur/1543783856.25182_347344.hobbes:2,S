Yes, I know... And that is going to be a disaster when you are
attempting to recover data from failing harddrive (and absolutely do
not want to write there).
There's a better reason, too. I do swsusp. Then I'd like to boot with
/ mounted read-only (so that I can read my config files, some
binaries, and maybe suspended image), but I absolutely may not write
to disk at this point, because I still want to resume.
Currently distros do that using initrd, but that does not allow you to
store suspended image into file, and is slightly hard to setup.
