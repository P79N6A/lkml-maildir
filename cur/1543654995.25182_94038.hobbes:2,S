Agreed here.  Add to this

Ug.  This is travelling backwards in time.
kmalloc is not intended to allocate memory for DMA'ing.  I (and others)
didn't spend all that time converting drivers to the PCI DMA API just to
see all that work undone.
Note that I am speaking from a driver API perspective, however.  If you
are talking about using kmalloc "under the hood" while still presenting
the same driver interface, that's fine.
