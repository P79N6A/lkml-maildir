I just started a little naive webpage where i collected some of the main
infos about linux-next on
http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/
while the wiki there is probably the best filled part. Does this
make any sense to you to continue this? Or do you already have something
else in mind or even already prepared?
Thanks,
Frank
