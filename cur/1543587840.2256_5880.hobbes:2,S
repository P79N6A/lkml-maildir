See the VIA chipset report on www.theregister.co.uk about corruption problems
with VIA chipsets. The cases seen on Linux included short and also sometimes
stale/corrupted DMA transfers.
Nothing in your report says it is or isnt going to be a VIA chipset problem
but once a fixed BIOS is out for your board that would be a good first step.
If it still does it then, its worth digging for kernel naughties
