Yes, the phandle would have been a good option... 
Unfortunately, when we defined the simplified device-tree format for use
by platforms without a real Open Firmware (embedded etc...), we made the
phandle optional (the flat device-tree format that we defined doesn't
have it, it's added as an optional property linux,phandle only when a
node needs to be referenced by another one, like interrupt-map's
etc...). Part of the reason there was to please embedded folks who
scream at every single byte added anywhere :-)
I suppose I can still decide that it's also mandatory for nodes that are
to be used as of_platform_device's though... I need to discuss that with
the embedded folks.
(BTW. I still need to look into back-porting some of your changes to
that stuff and possibly having some of that code moved to a common
location... I hope I'll have some time for that early next year).
Ben.
