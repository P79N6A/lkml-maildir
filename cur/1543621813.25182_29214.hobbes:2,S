Hi Linus,
I've removed the old (broken) bitkeeper tree with the
struct page changes and have put a new one in the same
place ... with the struct page changes in one changeset
with ready checkin comment.
You can resync from bk://linuxvm.bkbits.net/linux-2.5-struct_page
and you'll see that the stupid etc/config change is no longer there.
If you want to wait a version with pulling this change because
of the pte_highmem changes by Ingo and Arjan I can understand
that and will just bug you again in a version or so ;)
kind regards,
Rik
