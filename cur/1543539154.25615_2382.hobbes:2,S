it's not the volume of mails.  it's the charset throwing a monkey
wrench into your mailreader.  one is enough.
check out how kernelnotes mail listing in netscape goes nuts after it
hits one of these japanese spam land mines.  you can still read it,
but the subjects are in italics and each post has a bunch of empty
lines after it.
for example
<URL:
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_0007_03/>
however this might better be fixed over at kernelnotes to make its
maillist -> html script expunge offending characters.
