No, I'm not sure.
On further thinking the mapped_base would not be useful for you currently,
because at least in the SuSE/AMD64 kernel it only applies to 32bit processes.
The real solution is probably to pass in the search start hint in mmap's
address argument and not use MAP_32BiT. 
e.g. use something like
	/* 
  	 * Current gcc still needs PROT_EXEC because it doesn't call
	 * __enable_execute_stack for trampolines yet.
 	 */
	stack = mmap(0x1000, stack_size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, 	
		     MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0);
This will give you memory at the beginning of the address space and 
beyond 4GB if needed.
This may still be slow, but fixing the search algorithm is a different
problem that can be tackled separately.

I bet changing it will cost more nerves in supporting all these people
whose software doesn't compile anymore. And it's not really a lie. 2GB 
is 32bit too.
