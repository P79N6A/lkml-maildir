Not sure where the problem is coming from. If it is a kernel build 
problem, or a missing support file(s) problem. I've been working on 
g4l (Ghost for linux) and have been able to build additional nic and 
other support by using the later kernel.org kernels. That has all 
worked well. But I'm know trying to get the system to support the 
use of names rather than just ip addresses. The system can 
currently ping by ip number, but ping by name comes back with 
unknown server error. traceroute doesn't work with number or 
name. traceroute with ip number gives unknown protocol icmp, but 
ping works, and the messages I found on this problem point to 
missing /etc/protocols file, but I added that with no change.
traceroute with name give Unknown server error.
nslookup also gives unknown server error.
The g4l uses ncftp with no problem to upload images via the net 
using ip, but no name support. If I could add the support without 
major work, I would like to. I had about 9000 downloads of the new 
version files in November, so am hoping people find the program 
useful. To me using ip numbers is no problem, but some have asked 
for it. 
If anyone has an answer, or a place that I could look to find it. 
Currently, the system just uses the bzImage file, and mostly 
busybox for the system, and a few statically compiled programs.
Thanks.
