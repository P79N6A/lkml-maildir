Ingo,
Thanks for the quick reply.
An Andrew's advice a while back, Bob already got rid
of the allocate part -- it just isn't upstream yet.
Re: changing ACPICA code (sub-directories of drivers/acpi/) like this:
>-	flags = acpi_os_acquire_lock(acpi_gbl_gpe_lock);
>+	spin_lock_irqsave(&acpi_gbl_gpe_lock, flags);
I can't do that without either
1. diverging between Linux and ACPICA
or
2. getting a license back from you to Intel such that Intel can
   re-distrubute such a change under the Intel license on the file
   and
   inventing spin_lock_irqsave() on about 9 other operating systems.
#1 is all pain and no gain, unless the 244 net fewer bytes counts as
gain.
#2 wouldn't make sense either.
If this code were performance or size critical, I would still delete
acpi_os_acquire_lock from osl.c, but would inline it in aclinux.h.
thanks,
-Len
