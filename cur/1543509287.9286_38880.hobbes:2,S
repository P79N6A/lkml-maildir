In order to enforce bounding sets it is neccessary to require rawio access
to kmem in order to prevent rawio being set by other means and violating
the bounding set.
I agree on the compatibility point. I think a good compromise will be to
require raw I/O only if the bounding set for the system is not the set
of all capabilities.
Ok will look at that
