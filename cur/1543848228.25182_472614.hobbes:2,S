That's an isssue too, but it's separate from the one I was describing
(wherein warnings are wrongly issued in the long-established idiom of
"casting into the void").  That compiler bug is causing lots of crap
to be added all over the kernel.
As you implicitly observed, the __unregister() routine really can't
do a thing with faults; it calls "void device_unregister()", which
in turn calls device_del() etc.

Well, not me personally but "we" collectively as kernel developers.

I suspect what they were thinking was the old "if you can't figure out
how to handle the error, don't test for it" thing.  I've never quite
agreed that so many cleanup-path routines should return void.  It's not
as if they _can't_ hit failures.  Or that some of those failures can't
be coped with by at stopping further attempts at cleanup...
