ACPI people claim it would mean rewritting lot of code in
interpretter. And they are probably right: restoring irq states is
done via running ACPI AML code, and it may ask you to grab semaphore;
which is something you can't do with interrupts disabled.
So you'd have to teach ACPI interpretter completely different "irq
disabled" mode, and even then it is not clear what to do if AML code
asks you for some "sleeping operation".
[Hey, it should be Len doing this debate, not me. I hope I'll never
have to touch ACPI interpretter.]
