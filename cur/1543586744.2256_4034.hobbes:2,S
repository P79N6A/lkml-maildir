as you see it's revision 6
i've had no other problems with usb for now and use this
 idVendor           0x046d Logitech Inc.
 idProduct          0xc00c 
usb-wheelmouse all the time
i've never had this kernel or previous kernel (2.4.0test8) oopsen 
and it runs perfectly stable here

since i did'nt cause any troubles here i would not like to have the
complete AMD-756 blacklisted in the ohci-driver
eventually only some revisions are that bad
please correct me if i'm wrong i only don't want to blacklist complete
chipset-series
