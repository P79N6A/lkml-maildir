Hello!

Well, the guess was right and this is pleasant.
The only minor :-) question remained is to guess how rto could happen
to be at this value. I will think. Well, if you have some guesses,
please, tell me. Is this intel btw? I just see that other side
sends bogus misaligned tcp options... not a problem, but it can
be reason of funnyies with some probability.
