Of course it is. Stick your firewall peoples' noses into RFC 1435 and
tell them to let ICMP through, at least the "can't fragment" code.
Without them TCP won't work. In the meantime, try to disable Path MTU
discovery (echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc). Perhaps the
firewall is even so broken to attempt to "correct" TCP options, in
this case you can try to disable them all.
This is becoming more and more of a FAQ nowadays. It looks like the
number of people who think they have to rely on firewalls but don't
know enough TCP/IP to design and operate one is on the rise :-(
