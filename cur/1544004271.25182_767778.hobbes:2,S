Maybe you can do away with the statement-expression extension?  I've seen
cases where it cases gcc to generate worse code.  It seems like it
shouldn't, but it does.  I know DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST (maybe DIV_ROUND_NEAR?)
uses divisor twice, but all the also divide macros do that too, so why does
this one need to be different?
Note that if divisor is a signed variable, divisor/2 generates worse code
than divisor>>1.
