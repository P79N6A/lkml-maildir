I don't have the -ac[5] tree handy, in the 2.4.9-pre4 there's no BUG in
get_empty_inode(). For DVD-RAM + UDF, I would suggest using the version
from CVS. I know it quite recently got some fixes that removed a BUG or
two when used with the -ac kernels.
So could you reproduce with latest -ac or Linus kernel + CVS UDF?
Thanks.
