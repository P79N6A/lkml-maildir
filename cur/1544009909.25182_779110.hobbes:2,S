This patch manipulate the section names of these functions.
The better way would be to keep the section names as they are
and then in init.h decide where to add these sections.
This will require a new set of CONFIG_ symbols but then
it is obvious what happens.
Something like:
config	KEEP_INIT
	bool
config	KMEMLEAK
	...
	select KEEP_INIT
	select DEBUG_KEEP_CPUINIT
	select DEBUG_KEEP_MEMINIT
config HOTPLUG
	...
	select KEEP_INIT
And then use these symbols in vmlinux.lds.h
