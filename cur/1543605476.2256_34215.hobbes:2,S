Do not cc: me on this thread.
Check module.h and insmod.c before making statements like that.  The
BSD no advert license is not considered GPL compatible in the kernel.
Only Dual BSD/GPL is non-tainting, because the code is also available
under the GPL.  Anybody taking advantage of the BSD no adv license to
create a binary only module will be tainted.
That causes a problem for some modules in the kernel tree that have the
BSD no advert license.  Ideally these should be changed to dual BSD/GPL
but that may not be possible.  Since their source code is always
available, we might change them to
  "BSD without advertisement clause, source is in the kernel tree"
and add that string to the non-tainting list.  BSD no advert code that
is not in the kernel tree can either switch to dual BSD/GPL or be
tainted, at the choice of the supplier.
The affected code in the kernel tree is
