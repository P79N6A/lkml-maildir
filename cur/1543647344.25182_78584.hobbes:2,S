Larry is spot on.  I evaluated Clearcase, Bitkeeper, and Perforce
recently
for an 80 developer shop currently suffering with SourceSafe.
Clearcase was ridiculously expensive and complex; I would never use it.  
Bitkeeper appeared to have *exactly* the features we wanted,
and the price was not out of our range.  We eventually settled on trying
Perforce for a while because we know it could do most of what we needed,
but it was a really tough call.  Larry took the time to make sure we
understood the issues, and I have a lot of respect for him.
Anyone who says Larry is evil is smoking crack.  He's good people.
