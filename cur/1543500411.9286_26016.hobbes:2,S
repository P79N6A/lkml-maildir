What exactly goes wrong?  There are several pit-falls:
a) You changed /etc/printcap to use /dev/lp0, right?
b) Don't assume that /proc/ioports will list the port if
   you aren't using it; it won't.
c) If you're seeing Zip drive trouble, there is a known problem
   with ECP+EPP with some motherboards.
d) 2.2.10 has the latest and greatest parport code, and fixes a
   bug that was still present in 2.2.9.
e) Since 2.2.6 or so, parport will believe any parameters you
   give it, so they'd better be correct.
So, without knowing exactly what goes wrong it's difficult to say anything
more specific.  I'm assuming that parport_pc doesn't automatically detect
any ports, in which case:
- please try 2.2.10, which fixes a problem in that area.
- if that doesn't work, insmod parport_pc giving it the base
  address of the port, and show me the kernel messages (from dmesg):
  it should say whether or not it's happy about it, and if not why not.
Tim.
