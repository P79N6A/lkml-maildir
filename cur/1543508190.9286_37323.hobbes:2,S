Please test.  It is really easy to miss file corruption: the metadata
errors here

are spotted for you by the kernel, so I'd like to be _sure_ that the
silent corruptions which would happen if there were bit-flips in data
too are definitely absent.  md5sum or cmp can stress file content
checking quite easily.
Is knfsd a common factor in people seeing these problems, btw?  We had a
couple of cases in the past where knfsd was causing metadata funnies, so
if nobody is seeing these without knfsd I'll have a look to see if there
are any cases we are still getting wrong in there.
