Hello sirs ;
A part of my source is like this :
       static struct tq_struct Task = { /* Some inits */ };
       queue_task(&Task,&tq_timer);
With the line  #include <linux/tqueue.h>
When ever I compile my source as a module ,insmod tells me
"Unresolved symbole queue_task" .It seems that I have problem with
__inline__ functions .
How sholud I write my source ... What's the problem with inline
functions ?
              Regards
                ica
