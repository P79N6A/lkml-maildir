I sent r8169-4{0/1/2/3/4}0 on netdev + Jeff the 22/02/2005. Jeff's netdev
(thus your tree) already had the r8169-3xx changes.
Jeff has acked r8169-4{0/1/2/3}0 on 23/02/2005. r8169-440 (PCI-ID) won't
be applied (there should be no functionnal change nor merge side-effect).
r8169-4{5/6}0 have been published only here (so far).
So you can:
- apply r8169-4{0/1/2/3/5/6}0 if you have not updated to Jeff -netdev beyond
  what is currently available through plain old patch
- apply r8169-4{5/6}0 if you are bk-synced with Jeff -netdev (assuming that
  Jeff acked after he actually pushed to its bk repo)
- do something else until I verify the above and generate a dedicated
  patchsets for your tree.
