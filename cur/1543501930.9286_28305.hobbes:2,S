Well, seems my message struck a lot of nerves, resulting in name-calling
(trolls, the meaning of which the jargon file has englightened me on.) and
a whole lot of lost focus really.
It seems I inadvertantly made some TeX users angry (though I must note, I
was not the one implying that TeX users were abnormal) as their document
formatting DOES use a series of files in directories.
But I still maintain that a kernel hack is unnecessary. What's wrong with
keeping files in a directory? Nothing! It's obviously worked for them for
what... at least 15 or more years. But why try to represent that directory
as anything BUT a directory? That's my point. I see little advantage in
introducing these schizophrenic tendencies for documents.
One thing I stopped short on saying in my first email was this; Can any 
one person name no less that five things that cannot be done (or would be
terribly ugly to do) with the status quo, but could be done with a kernel
assisted 'albod' hack? I've yet to see many potential applications for
this.
If you reply, please ensure I am CCed, as replying to the digestified
version of linux-kernel is rather annoying. Also, if anyone wants to go on
a flame rant (which some of you did) please change the subject line such
that I am not associated with it.
Thanks.
