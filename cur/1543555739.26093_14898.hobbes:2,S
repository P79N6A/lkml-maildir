This is pretty much personal opinion :)
The C language is full of implicit as well as explicit features.  You
are arguing that using an implicit feature robs the programmer of
information.  For you maybe...  For others, no information is lost AND
the code is more clean AND the kernel is smaller.  It's just a matter of
knowing and internalizing "the rules" in your head.
