Sleeping until at most time X is only useful if the kernel can actually
make a guarantee like that.  If you are doing hard real time fine, otherwise
that doesn't work to well.

Actually I have had occasion in dosemu to not use the timeout features
because it did not do a good job of attempting to sleep for X seconds.
There can be a lot of time from when the kernel updates the timeout
value, and when the system call is restarted.
The desired semantics in this case were I want to sleep until time X,
and I want to wake up as soon afterwards as is reasonable.  Calling
gettimeofday before restarting the system call resulted in a much
better approximation of the desired result.
