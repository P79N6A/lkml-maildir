It's like I wrote in the top post. The problem is not command.com or some 
other freedos application, but an old, proprietary clipper DB application, 
which, in a lot of situations, doesn't behave nice but loops while waiting 
for user interaction.
I tested with dosemu 1.4.0 btw. With dosemu 1.2.x, clipper apps aren't even 
working.
