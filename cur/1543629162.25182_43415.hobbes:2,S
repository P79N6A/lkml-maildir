Yeah, I have to say, kbuild 2.5 is definitely a nice thing..
Looking fw to seeing it included in mainline.
Btw, Keith, how's the bug (if it is a bug at all) w/ CONFIG_MODVERSIONS?
Whenever I built a kernel with it set using kbuild 2.5 everything went fine
up to the moment I tried to load a module into the new kernel -- not one would
actually work, complaining about unresolved symbols (at the same time, though,
depmod -ae had nothing to report). Since I couldn't find any info on this
I concluded it might be that CONFIG_MODVERSIONS was considered obsolete and
as such would no longer be supported?
Another question I'd like to ask (soooorry :D) -- would there be a little
cunning target in Makefile-2.5 that'd create the asm-$arch symlink for me
in include/ like kbuild 2.4 does? Whenever I run "make -f Makefile-2.5 clean"
followed by "make -f Makefile-2.5 menuconfig" I get some serious whipping
from kbuild 2.5, cos the asm-$arch symlink gets deleted in the cleaning,
and I have to resurrect it by hand.
cheers,
t.
