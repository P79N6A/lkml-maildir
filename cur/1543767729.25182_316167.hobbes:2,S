I've tried disabling ACPI in the kernel, turning on APM support in the
BIOS, and the combination of the two, and unfortunately the problem
persisted.
However, I found this patch (the one at the very bottom of the page):
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg78894.html
And after adapting it to the 2.6.11.7 kernel, everything works again!
I've rebooted the machine several times, and the 3com cards initialized
successfully every time.
I'm CC'ing linux-kernel in the hopes that this fix can make it into the
mainstream kernel sometime soon.  I'm sure my mother would appreciate it
greatly. :)
Please CC my e-mail address in any replies as I am not subscribed to this

thanks,
