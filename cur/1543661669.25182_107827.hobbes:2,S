The delay should be made controller specific.  On most controllers the 
reading of the alt status we need to do to flush the write command to 
the drive will also cause enough of a delay so that the ndelay isn't 
needed at all.  For example the on the Promise 20265 and 20267 the alt 
status read will always take at least 600ns.
