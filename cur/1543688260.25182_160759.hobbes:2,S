Remember when AT Class machines had a BIOS that allowed you
to low-level format hard drives? When early IDE drives came
out, persons tried to format them and they got destroyed.
So, BIOS vendors took away the format capability.
The IDE drive companies started a lie that was repeated so
often that it seemed true. It was that IDE drives didn't
have 'formatters' and, therefore, could only be formatted
at the factory. Of course, if this was true, how come
the format command did anything??  The truth was that
these drives stored their parameters on the disk platters.
If you re-wrote the first real sectors on the drive, the
drive no longer 'knew' what its parameters were and the
drive was broken forever. The actual seeks to various
logical sectors would bypass these private sectors so,
normally, this was invisible to the end-user. However,
if you re-wrote a whole track (what format does), these
invisible sectors would be overwritten.
With your NVRAM drive, it is likely that the drive parameters
are 'protected' by a partition table. If you overwrite this
partition table, the drive becomes broken. This means that,
whatever you do, you can't modify some important portion
of that table.
