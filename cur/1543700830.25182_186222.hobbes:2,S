I thought I explained this above, quite verbosely :-) 
Rather than make the sound drivers depend directly on GAMEPORT, which
is troublesome because Kconfig has no provisions for this type of
dependancy, we create an artificial dependency, SOUND_GAMEPORT, which
the sound driver depends on. SOUND_GAMEPORT depends on GAMEPORT, and
Kconfig ends up doing the right thing. I hope that was clearer.
