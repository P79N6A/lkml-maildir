Bill, this list is just about kernel development.
Usually, if your screen just got blank, it means you didn't add a
necessary module for your computer. Your best bet is to read "Linux
Kernel in a Nutshell", by Greg KH: 
http://www.kroah.com/lkn/
Specially, Chapter 7: Customizing a Kernel.
Then, if your screen still gets black and you think it is a kernel
bug, report it.
