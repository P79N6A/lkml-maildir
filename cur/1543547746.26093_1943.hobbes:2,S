Hell knows. Let me put it that way: one long-standing bug definitely
had kicked the bucket. The question being: had any other crap survived?
In other words, if you can reproduce fs corruption on clean ext2 (after
forced fsck if you've used it with earlier kernels) - tell.
Notice that there is an unrelated problem with pine - if this sucker
corrupts the mailbox if it has to deal with a message containing long
X-something headers. _That_ bug has nothing with Linux - it can be easily
reproduced on any system (looks like a very sloppy programming and
possibly an exploitable buffer overrun).
