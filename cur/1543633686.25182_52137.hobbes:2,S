There are various flags for memory allocation that prevent it (usually)
from being recursive (or livelocking).
Though I'm not really convinced by Al's argument. I think if you do a
breadth-first traversal of the possible call tree, as you get past a
certain predicted stack depth, you'll be able to manually prune things
that aren't of interest. Very few things should be potentially recursive
or mutally recursive and any that are probably bear closer manual
scrutiny.
How's Checker do on passing through function pointers?
