hi !
i was wondering how to make kernel messages appear on /dev/ttyS0 without a reboot, i.e. kernelparam "console=ttyS0"
after playing for a while with setconsole, setterm and klogconsole i didn`t find a way to make that happen.
i can do "setconsole /dev/tty1 </dev/console" and then "echo test >/dev/console" and see "test" on tty1
"setterm -msg on -msglevel 8 >/dev/console"  (or >/dev/tty1), modprobe loop;rmmod loop - and i see the kernel message there
i can do "setconsole /dev/ttyS0 </dev/console" and then "echo test >/dev/console" and see "test" on ttyS0
BUT :
"setterm -msg on -msglevel 8 >/dev/console"  (or >/dev/ttyS0), modprobe loop;rmmod loop  ......  nothing!
since i came across jan`s posting from 2005, which didn`t get a reply i think it`s not that stupid to ask again...
any clue how to do that at runtime or what`s the issue here ? (see excerpts below) 
i can set 
regards
roland

Hi,
there is a klogconsole utiltity that allows to change the console to which 
kernel messages are printed. However, is it possible to redirect to ttyS0 
without a reboot?
