Hello,
Just installed a Gigabyte MA770-DS3 board: 
http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ProductID=2722
It has an iTE IT8718 chip according to this url.
But:
sensors-detect says:
Trying family `ITE'...                                      Yes
Found unknown chip with ID 0x8720
And:
modprobe it87 says no such device although 8718F is supported.
Is this a known issue?
Anybody working on it?
How to fix?
Need more info?
Can I help?
Etc?
Kind regards,
Udo
