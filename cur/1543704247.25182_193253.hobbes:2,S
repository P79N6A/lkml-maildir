Hi
Is anyone else having problems with vt(s)?  I can switch between X and vt 1 without
problems.  Trying to use any of the other vt(s) fails.   
A+C+F1 flips from X to vt1
A+F2 flips to vt7 (x)
A+C+F2 from X does nothing
In my logs there are messages about init spawing too fast.  Suspect that these are
the processes for the Vt(s) started with:
2:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty2
etc.
Kernel is 2.6.2-rc2, dist is debian unstable with X from experimental.
TIA,
Ed Tomlinson
