One doesn't give capabilities to random executables. One uses them
in place of existing setuid-root settings. Consider this program:
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root     root        14148 Jan 10  1998 /bin/ping
Right now it is setuid-root, with full capabilities.
With my proposal, it gets far fewer capabilities.
If you revert to the old kernel, you should get the old security.
You really need a setuid-root setting that is ignored by newer
kernels, so that you can still run an old kernel with traditional
security. Without this, /bin/ping and others won't run on old kernels.

No, you get back the old holes (if any) when you run an old kernel.

Of course, a buffer overflow would still grant root and full
capabilities. (mount an ext2 floppy with privileged executables)
BTW, this is Red Hat 5.0 mount:
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root     root        34424 Jan 10  1998 /bin/mount

It is a minor missing feature. You should not grant capabilities
to executables you don't trust, and you should not run crummy
old kernels. I had indeed assumed that you would only be reducing
the capabilities that current setuid-root executables have, not
granting capabilities to new poorly-trusted executables.
When replacing setuid-root with capabilities, you certainly do
want a fallback to the old setuid-root system.

The sticky bit would work fine over NFS. In that case, there must be
a header flag to disable setuid operation. This is because /bin/ping
and others must be setuid-root when running with an old kernel, but
should not be root when they can just get the needed capabilities.
I prefer the setuid bit though, because it will be noticed by scripts
that look for suspicious executables. It is much less likely that a
script will notice an executable with the sticky bit set. (but this
is still better than a strange new file attribute)
Well, which do people prefer? (sticky bit or setuid bit)
