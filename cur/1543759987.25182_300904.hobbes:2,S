NO.  I did not say this.  EACH PROCESS'S KERNEL STACK IS A PAGE OR TWO.
That is all I said.
The kernel can consume hundreds of megabytes of data if it wants.  And
it does.

No.  Each process's stack is a page or two.  The rest of the kernel is
free to use a lot of memory.

Yes, the interrupt runs in the stack of the current process or (given
CONFIG_IRQSTACKS) its own stack.  Dynamic memory is free to come from
all over.

That explains what, exactly?  Kernel stacks are in Ch2 (1ed) and Ch3
(2ed), I think.

Yes, a process's kernel stack cannot be resized.

The user-space stack is handled by user-space.  It is tracked by
mm_struct->start_stack.
The kernel stack is handled by user-space.  It is stored in esp,
obviously, while inside of the kernel.  And, yes, alloc_thread_info()
allocates the stack.
