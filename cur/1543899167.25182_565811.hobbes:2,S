This is a very interesting idea.  Are you certain it is safe?  That is,
if a task is waiting for a mutex and sometime later the mutex becomes
available, will the task then enter the freezer immediately -- before
it can do any I/O or call any drivers?
If you can't make this guarantee, then you might as well simply not try 
to freeze any user task until it returns from kernel mode to user mode.  
And then you will face the problem of a user task doing I/O during 
hibernate after the atomic snapshot has been made.
I had in mind something more complicated.  My idea was to define 
certain mutexes as "freezable", with the thought that it would be okay 
for a task in the freezer to own freezable mutexes.  None of the 
mutexes needed by drivers or the PM core during a suspend transition 
should be freezable.
Presumably the VFS locks _would_ fall into the freezable category.  In 
order for this to work, we would have to guarantee the following:
	A thread blocked in the kernel waiting for some response
	from userspace is allowed to hold freezable mutexes but no
	other locks.
	When a thread tries to acquire a freezable mutex, it is allowed
	to hold other freezable mutexes but no other locks.
	When the freezer is running, any task that is blocked on a
	freezable mutex (maybe also any task that tries to acquire 
	an unlocked freezable mutex) would immediately go into the 
	freezer.  So would any task waiting for a response from
	userspace.
I think this would solve the VFS-related problems (FUSE's and others).  
But obviously Raphael's approach is preferable, if it works.
