Thanks.
	I _had_ come across the 8259A before, but I'm ashamed to say that
I haven't looked for it on my board, nor have I seen it in anywhare in
/proc.
Hence the bad judgement :) Your mail just clicked everything to place.
	At any rate, I haven't got this message from the kernel after 2.4.8
_with_ stable compilers. My IRQ7 is used by the printer driver which is
compiled-in.
