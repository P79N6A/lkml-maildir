Well, yes, PowerNP support has been in the kernel for years and embedded
Linux distros like Mvista support them.  It's no longer an IBM chip,
though.  AMCC purchased the PPC4xx network processors (PowerNP) from
IBM and later purchased the entire standard SoC PPC4xx product line
from IBM.  That is, except for the PPC4xx STB chips like are found in
the Hauppage MediaMVP, IBM retained those.  AMCC pretty much owns all
the PPC4xx line and PowerNP 405H/L are still available.
