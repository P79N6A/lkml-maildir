Well, Linus opted not to merge it for 2.6.29-rc1, which means it is dead
for this merge cycle.  This gives us a couple of options, with the aim
to get it merged into 2.6.30:
- We can continue to carry it in the -tip tree, which also means it will
  be in the linux-next tree.
- We can push it to Andrew Morton for the -mm tree.
- Sam could take it in his kbuild tree.
Out of these, I think the kbuild tree is entirely inappropriate.  The
selection of the other two is mostly a matter of testing, and which way
will be easier to add the ARM code and other arch support.
