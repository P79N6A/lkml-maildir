Wow!  Amazing.  I think you're missing the nut.  The sizeof operator
is not sending back a wrong argument, but the variable could be
getting trashed.  You also could be attempting to printk a size_t of
something big in userspace eg, the coda fs guys do a lot of printk's
of the size of stuff on the coda server.  Now the server is in
userspace across the network.  All kinds of things could trash the
size_t.  If you silently truncate it you severly limit its usefulness
as a diagnostic aid.  This has _nothing_ to do with having 4GB data
structures in your kernel.

Its not zero benefit, its portability, and correctness, and a
standard.

Not the sizeof().

This isn't about printing pointers (I know about %p).  Its about
size_t.

Great, now my Alpha is restricted to the size_t of intel.  Very
nice...
