Subject: 2.3.19 vgacon change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Was this change necessary?  Not all implementations of scr_readw are
implemented as volatile references.  The pointer should be cast to
volatile in the implementation of scr_readw(), not in the code itself.
