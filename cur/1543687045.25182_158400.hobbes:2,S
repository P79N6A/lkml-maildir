Well, this is not the desired behaviour, at least not for me. Any
ideas what I could do to solve this problem? I sent an oprofile output
to lkml, perhaps that helps?
I am more than willing to give every information needed to debug this
problem, because this bad interactive behaviuor is really annoying.
Is there a slight possibility that this problem is not specific to
2.5/2.6, because I encounter similar problems on 2.4?
Ciao,
Stefan
