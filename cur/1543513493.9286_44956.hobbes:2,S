The reasoning looks correct to me, and I just used fgrep to analyse
the entire 2.3.22 tree, with the ones you pointed out being the only
naked ones I came across.
However, I also came across a related oddity, which the following
patch appears to convert to the same usage as elsewhere:

This is the ONLY such file with this construct in related to that
variable. WHat I would like to know is whether there is any difference
between the construct used before and after that patch is applied? As
I see it, if there is a difference between the two, then the other
lines comparing "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" to "y" will also need to be
changed in the reverse way to the above.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
