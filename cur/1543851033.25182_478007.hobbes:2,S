Hey all,
I am a Linux newbie.
I read about the huge page corner cases i.e problems may occur on
using hueg pages in Linux , the linux of the page is:
http://linux-mm.org/HugePageCornerCases
The first corner case is given as
-NUMA-aware allocation - don't want all the memory accesses going
through a common controller.
Can anyone please specify what the statement means as I didn't clearly
get its meaning? And what can be a possible solution for it?
