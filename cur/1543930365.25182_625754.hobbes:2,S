Subject: [PATCH 1/3] will_become_orphaned_pgrp: we have threads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

p->exit_state != 0 doesn't mean this process is dead, it may have sub-threads.
However, the new "p->exit_state && thread_group_empty(p)" check is not correct
either, this is just the temporary hack. Perhaps we can just remove this check,
but I don't understand orphaned process groups magic. At all. However, I think
exit_notify() is obviously and completely wrong wrt this helper.
