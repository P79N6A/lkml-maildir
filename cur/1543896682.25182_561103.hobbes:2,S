there are 120 tasklet_init()s in the tree and 224 tasklet_schedule()s. 
Pushing it into thread context should work just fine (Steve's patchset 
certainly works on my testbox), as even today we can execute softirqs 
(and hence tasklets) in ksoftirqd. In fact, -rt has been executing 
tasklets in task context for over 2.5 years meanwhile. Do we really want 
to upset the whole API? Realistically it just wont ever be removed, like 
the BKL.
