I agree totally. I think that MS is just trying to force Linux out of the
market using it's trusty old methods. Having just read the Halloween
documents, I think that that is what they will do. But, soon the courts
split MS up, so they have to share all the protocol info. Like it or not,
currently MS rules and is just going to continue creating more complexed
protocols to try to kill Linux and then, if that doesn't work, I believe
we will see MS linux <shudder> :-((
