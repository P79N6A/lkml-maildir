Now that 2.6.0-test is out, can someone point me at the definative 
instrictions for compiling and booting a 2.6.x kernel?
I understand that the compile process has changed since 2.4.x, and I may also 
need some updated module related things.
This doesnt have to be a handholding guide, just a quick rundown/qhecklist 
will do.
Cheers,
Mark.
