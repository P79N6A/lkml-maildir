Hi
I am implementing a soft switch that can switch packets received on an
interface over certain outgoing interfaces.
The setup is -
	+-----------+		+------------+		+------+
	| Streamer  |-----------|   Switch   |----------| Host |
	+-----------+		+------------+		+------+
The switching functionality is implemented in function netif_rx(). Based
on the list of outgoing interfaces, I am doing the following things.
* Cloning the packets.
* Obtaining outgoing device from outgoing interface index.
* Calling dev_queue_xmit() to send the packet on outgoing device.
I am having the following is PROBLEM with this:
			     ~~~~~~~
When streamer sends a continuous flow of packets to switch, the switch is
able to send upto 3500 (approx. - this varies each time) to the host and
afterwards, the switch is hanging.
I tried sending bunches of 100 packets each with 1 second time gap between
bunches, the switch is functioning without interruptions.
- Is there any problem in the way I am implementing the switch? The
  "bridge" code seems to be doing the same things.
- Or, is there is some limit on the incoming flow rate the kernel will be
  able to handle?
I would be very grateful if someone can help me with this.
Regards
Madhavi.
