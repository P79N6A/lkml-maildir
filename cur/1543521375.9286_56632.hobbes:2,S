Just my 0.2 cent:
   - Etherboot supports loading kernels by TFTP, but also supports
     loading of ``tagged-images'', which are a kernel and a compressed
     initrd. Tested, works.
   - Etherboot may not support all plateforms (I didn't check).
Of course, this means you need kernel + compressed initrd size in memory
+ decompressed size, and this could be a problem if you have little memory.
Recreating a new initrd is possible, independantly from the kernel
image (you use a tool named mknbi to glue them into a tagged-image).
I am not sure this has any relevance to the discussion.
