http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.18pre9/
 does not have -7.

Now running 2.2.18pre17 + -7 since a few days
The problems I had appear to be gone.  However with this kernel I have
bursts of error messages from nscd (from glibc 2.1.95) like this one taken
from daemon.log:
Nov  5 22:36:17 bylbo nscd: 925: while accepting connection: Cannot allocate memory
They usually appear at cron.daily time, although it looks like I kinda can
reproduce them.  I'm still investigating and narrowing - they seem to avoid
me unfortunately :(  Will launch a tracking job for the night, hopefully
I'll narrow to the single cron job this time.
Anyone seen that ?

I prefer running "patch --dry-run", I hate it when I have to wait for bzip2
and tar :}
Best regards,
