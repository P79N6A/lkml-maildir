I've never heard of this problem before. As far as I'm aware the EXTRAVERSION 
usually is not included in version.h so it seems to be a limitation of the 
flgrx installer? That would mean the flgrx installer wouldn't work on any 
kernel with an extra version such as the -rc releases of mainline even. So 
I'm sorry but I don't really know what to do about this problem.
