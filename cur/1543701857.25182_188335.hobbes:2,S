Then you're unlikely to get the feature until someone else finds it
worth their while to implement it.

So do the same thing with NFS now that we've finally gotten RPC over TCP
fully supported under Linux too: everybody else has had it for years.
In 2.6.x, we've also added native RPCSEC_GSS support for kerberos-based
authentication. Packet integrity checking and full privacy are in the
pipeline, as are other security mechanisms.

Dunno if anybody has ever written a proper history of NFS, but I can ask
around. Here are a few sources I found on the fly though. They all tend
to relate to the history of the protocol, and not much about
implementation history (shame that).
NFSv2 transition to NFSv3
        
http://www.netapp.com/tech_library/evolution.html
        RFC1813
transition to NFSv4 
        
http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/nfsv4-charter.html
        (in particular see 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2624.txt
 which
        runs through the earlier design considerations)
        RFC3530 (the final version of the protocol)
I'd also recommend nosing around the Connectathon site on
http://www.connectathon.org/
That contains a record of talks going back to 95 (not really that long -
I know) and so should help out with the more recent history.
...of course if you google around, you'll also find loads of Powerpoint
presentations etc...
Cheers,
