I've already worked round it for the 2.[024] case by reintroducing the
ifdefs. I assume here that we're planning for 2.5. As part of the many
changes that are going to be introduced during 2.5, this shouldn't be too
intrusive.
Once it's actually usable for the common case, it won't just be 'a very few 
special cases' any more. But that's all 2.5 material.
