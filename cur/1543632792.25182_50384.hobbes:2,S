Jeff Garzik was working on that a while back - a separate filesystem
which provides a "metadata view" of a real filesytem.  So you can
poke around and find all these things out.  In theory, different
filesystems should be able to offer the same view.

The e2fsprogs package includes a `libe2fs' library which offers
APIs for accessing the fs internals.  It's exactly what you
say - direct disk access and knowledge of internals.  So
that plus the try_to_relocate_page() ioctl is a shortest-path
route to a defragmenter for ext3, and only ext3.  I wasn't
aiming very high here ;)
A totally different way of performing defrag could be to
copy the entire fs from one partition to a different one,
with kernel support for providing coherency while the copy
is in progress.  It's basically a union/translucent mount
with COW.  Swizzle the backing blockdev, drop the disk
mappings from all incore pages, renumber the inode without
breaking stuff...  (OK, I've talked myself out of it ;/) It's
not super efficient, and it does require the provisioning of a
bounce disk, but it would use infrastructure which would be
useful for other stuff and it is fs-agnostic.
