I have the same problem here. I untarred the plain 2.0.36, applied
the 2.0.37pre4 patch, did "make menuconfig" (without modifying any-
thing) and then saved the config.
The newly created ".config" only lists:
CONFIG_MEM_STD=y
# CONFIG_MEM_ENT is not set
# CONFIG_MEM_SPECIAL is not set
The line "CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE=1024" (or whatever value) is missing.
In 2.0.37pre3 the config file has the "CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE" entry,
but not the CONFIG_MEM_STD/CONFIG_MEM_ENT/CONFIG_MEM_SPECIAL entries,
which are obviously new to 2.0.37pre4.
Another point is:
After hitting return on any of the config options (eg, on
"[ ] Kernel math emulation" the error message
	scripts/Menuconfig: define_int: command not found
appears. From now on the configuration dialog is seriously
broken, because I get this error message not only for modifying
config options but for every action in the config dialog.
In case it is of any interest, I'm using RedHat 5.2 with
included binutils packages (2.9.1.0.15-1).
	Greetings, Andreas
