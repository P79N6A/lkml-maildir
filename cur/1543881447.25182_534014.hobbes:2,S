No matter what actual instruction is used, the SetPageLRU operation (ie.
without the double underscore prefix) must be atomic, and the __SetPageLRU
operation *can* be non-atomic if that would be faster.
As Hugh points out, we must have atomic ops here, so changing the generic
code to use the __ version is wrong. However if there is a faster way that
i386 can perform the atomic variant, then doing so will speed up the generic
code without breaking other architectures.
