Agreed.  But changing every printk in the kernel does not make sense.
Clean up and standardize the printks(), then post-process the printk() info.

If you note, the net drivers I write from scratch follow the Becker 
style of messaging as well.  It is not difficult to have a style guide 
and adhere to it.  We don't need a new API for that.

I think you misunderstand...  If you want to standardize the messages, 
you change the text in the strings, and perhaps the args passed to 
printk, so that they look the same from driver to driver.
This is useful, needed work that benefits POSIX event logging -- while 
at the same time providing better value to normal printk() users.

The backend is fairly sound.  And I agree in general event logging is 
useful, and I fully support integrating [sane] support into the kernel.
But the kernel API is utter crap.
Adding <foo>_problem.h for every subsystem?
Adding <foo>_introduce() for every subsystem?
Changing every printk() in the damn kernel?
Come on dude, I _know_ you have more taste than that.
