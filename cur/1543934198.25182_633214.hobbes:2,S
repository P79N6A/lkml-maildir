Ok...will include this after I pick up some more comments.

Hmm...since enabling preemption is tied to 'ret', anyone reading
kprobe_handler will have to follow around all calls which modify it.
There are some checks in the current kprobe_handler definition made
just to do what you're saying, i.e, to push all preemption
enable/disables in krpobe_handler. LIke this one (from the current x86
kprobe_handler):
------------
ret = reenter_kprobe(p, regs, kcb);
if (kcb->kprobe_status == KPROBE_REENTER)
{
    ret = 1;
    goto out;
}
goto preempt_out;
-------------
This is just confusing because we're not actually making any
exceptions here for the KPROBE_REENTER case (which has been partially
handled in reenter_kprobe), rather just tricking our way out of
preemption enabling for a cpl of cases in reenter_kprobe.
