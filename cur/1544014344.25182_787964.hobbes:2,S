Heh.  Glad to see it wasn't just me that had perrennial problems with
locking in the orinoco driver due to trouble with the hardware.
Incidentally, the approach descibed in the Agere driver sounds
not-dissimilar to an approach I thought about, which I think would fix
most of the problems we've seen, but I never got around to
implementing.
That is to run all the guts of the driver in a single kernel thread,
which just loops most of the time sending any queued packets,
receiving any available packets and otherwise sleeping.  The interrupt
path and the userland entry points would do nothing except flag and
wakeup the main thread.
Because everything would be single threaded, we'd no longer need any
locks for hardware contention, which sidesteps all the problems we've
seen with the hardware taking too damn long to respond for operations
that could contend.  Even for reset, which takes ages, and on Prism
firmware with WEP enabled when the BAP occasionally takes ages to
respond.  The only locks would be to protect the flags/queues that are
used to signal the master thread, and since that's entirely under
software control we can make sure the critical sections are small
enough.
I suspect it would also allow support for USB orinoco hardware to be
integrated more sanely than the current organization.
It's not exactly a high throughput approach, but given the hardware's
so crappy anyway, I don't think it would be a significant problem.
