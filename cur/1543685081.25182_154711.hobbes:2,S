By the way, is your tree visible somewhere?
I have a giant patch with quite a lot of improvements and
minor bug fixes, all in the geometry / IDENTIFY area.
Usually I diff against Linus' most recent version, but we
already had one by Erik and two by me, and stuff overlaps,
and I do not yet see any of this in Linus' tree.
Usually I wait with sending the next until I see the previous
patch applied, but when there are many fragments that process
is excruciatingly slow. So, maybe I can come with a series of
patches against your tree?
