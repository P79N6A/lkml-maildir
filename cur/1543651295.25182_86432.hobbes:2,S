... will give him nothing, since he is not in chroot jail to start with.
He has a namespace of his own with his own root filesystem.  Which has
several empty directories and nothing else - everything else is bound on
these.  He is at his absolute root and can't break out of it - there is
nowhere to break out.  So his /foo will be a subdirectory of root of his
root filesystem.  OK, he chroots there.  His cwd is still at absolute root
and he can follow .. until he's blue in the face - he will stay where he
started.
