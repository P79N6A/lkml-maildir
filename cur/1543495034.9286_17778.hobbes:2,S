On a redhat 5.2 machine.  program compiled with egcs, kernel by gcc:
[gaz ~]$ cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.2.7 (root@REMOVED) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1
SMP Sat May 1 22:19:31 EDT 1999
[gaz ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost 2.2.7 #1 SMP Sat May 1 22:19:31 EDT 1999 i686
unknown
[gaz ~]$ ./test
No signal received.
I can also give an strace, but it doesn't look like its much of a help.
The SIGIO just doesn't appear to the process.
Running glibc 2.0.7-29 from Redhat
