More experience with 2.6.7-rc3-bk6: this is basically the same, although
the console stalled twice during one boot, once after mounting all the
filesystems and then again after the ethernet comes up (as always).
Also, I was wrong about getting one character of output for each that I
type - it looks like I get 16 characters (if that many are available to
be printed, seemingly).
