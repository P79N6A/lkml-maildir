Subject: [PATCH 00/59] trivial - Add missing "space" in multiline quoted strings

Fix quoted string which do not have a space separating
the next word on continuation quoted strings.
for example:
    "a line with a word"
    "but no space"
is equivalent to:
    "a line with a wordbut no space"
which becomes:
    "a line with a word "
    "but no space"
