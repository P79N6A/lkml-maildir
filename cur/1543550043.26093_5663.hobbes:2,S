arch/i386/kernel/msr.c has been there since at least 2.4.0-test1.  A
web search reveals a lot of other patches for performance counter
libraries on Linux.  
http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/Projects/Rabbit/
 is a
good start, it indicates that people are already using the counters.

Agreed, having the support is a high priority.  Changing the default
behaviour of the performance counters is where we differ.

I originally did that but it users have to tweak their boot files
whenever they install a new kernel.  Making it a config option
propagates the user's requirements from one kernel build to another.
Let's just agree to disagree and put your patch in the mainline kernel.
