If you properly handle system-wide OOM situations by killing tasks (see my
other emails about doing this with the OOM killer patch + a userspace
daemon), then you no longer have system crashes.
Yes, your app can be killed, but that is also what happens with quotas. In
fact, it happens earlier with quotas.
