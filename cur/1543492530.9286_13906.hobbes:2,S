I don't expect anyone to remember the problem I was having, but I thought
I'd give some feedback for others who might have had the same symptoms.
I've got an AMI Goliath with an AHA2940u.  This is strange in that the
goliath has dual independent pci busses and the 2940 is on the second
bus.
Ever since somewhere around 2.1.126, the system would boot fine but would
die after a few hours; anything that wanted to touch disk would hang
indefinitely, switching to the console later revealed the scsi driver having
a heck of a time with the bus...it would sit in a little infite loop of
timeouts and bus resets which would never work.  I'm convinced the bus resets
were failing because normally on bus resets, one of my scsi devices makes a
very audible and distinctive KLACK...that wasn't hapening.
At any rate, 2.2.5-ac6 is the first kernel I've tried since 2.1 that works
on this box.
19 hours and running, thanks folks.
