[8/9] netconsole: Update documentation for dynamic reconfigurability
Add myself to parties interested in receiving bug reports, and give lots
of examples. Also fix some whitespace inconsistencies I introduced earlier.

+Dynamic reconfiguration:
+========================
+
+Dynamic reconfigurability is a useful addition to netconsole that enables
+remote logging targets to be dynamically added, removed, or have their
+parameters reconfigured at runtime from a configfs-based userspace interface.
+
+To include this feature, select CONFIG_NETCONSOLE_DYNAMIC when building the
+netconsole module (or kernel, if netconsole is built-in).
+
+Some examples follow (configfs is mounted at the /config mountpoint, say).
+
+To add a remote logging target (target names can be arbitrary):
+
+ cd /config/netconsole/
+ mkdir target1
+
+Note that newly created targets have default parameter values (as mentioned
+above) and are disabled by default -- they must first be enabled by writing
+"1" to the "enabled" attribute (usually after setting parameters accordingly)
+as described below.
+
+To remove a target:
+
+ rmdir /config/netconsole/othertarget/
+
+The interface exposes these parameters of a netconsole target to userspace:
+
+	id		Unique identifier for this target	(read-only)
+	enabled		Is this target currently enabled?	(read-write)
+	dev_name	Local network interface name		(read-only)
+	local_ip	Source IP address to use		(read-write)
+	remote_ip	Remote agent's IP address		(read-write)
+	local_port	Source UDP port to use			(read-write)
+	remote_port	Remote agent's UDP port			(read-write)
+	local_mac	Local interface's MAC address		(read-only)
+	remote_mac	Remote agent's MAC address		(read-write)
+
+The "enabled" attribute is also used to control whether the parameters of
+a target can be updated or not -- you can modify the parameters of only
+disabled targets (i.e. if "enabled" is 0).
+
+To update a target's parameters:
+
+ cat enabled				# check if enabled is 1
+ echo 0 > enabled			# disable the target (if required)
+ echo eth2 > dev_name			# set local interface
+ echo 10.0.0.4 > remote_ip		# update some parameter
+ echo cb:a9:87:65:43:21 > remote_mac	# update more parameters
+ echo 1 > enabled			# enable target again
+
+Note that you can even update the local interface dynamically. This is
+especially useful if you want to use interfaces that have newly come up
+and didn't even exist when netconsole was loaded / initialized.

 ethernet address to send packets, which can cause increased load on
