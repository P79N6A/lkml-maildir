I think most others just define the compat data structures in the
same file that implements the headers, inside the same #ifdef that
hides the functions using them.
This makes sense, because the data structures here don't define
an interface, but rather describe what the interface looks like
in the 32 bit case.

All common compat_* data structures are defined in 
include/{linux,asm}/compat.h, which are empty if CONFIG_COMPAT=n.
It's against our normal conventions to hide declarations
inside an #ifdef, but I can see that it does keep the code
size down to make it impossible to compile code that is used
for compat on architectures that don't need it.
