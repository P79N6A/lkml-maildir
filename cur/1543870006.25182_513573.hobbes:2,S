That could be changed too. The "void *key" doesn't need to be NULL. Wake 
ups to f_op->poll() waiters can use that to send ready events directly, 
avoiding an extra f_op->poll() to fetch them.
Infrastructure is already there, just need a big patch to do it everywhere ;)

The really ancient version of epoll (called /dev/epoll at that time) was 
doing a very similar thing. Was adding custom plugs is all over the places 
where we wanted to get events from, and was collecting them w/out 
resorting to extra f_op->poll(). Event masks going straight through an 
event buffer.
The reason why the current design of epoll was chosen, was because:
o Was not requiring custom plus all over the places
o Was working with the current kernel abstractions as-is (though f_op->poll)
