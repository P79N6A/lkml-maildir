Here are a few reasons off the top of my head:
1. Adding extra unneeded complexity. Debugging would be harder.
2. Not many people can code ObjC when compared to the number of C coders.
3. If it ain't broken... Why fix it. The kernel works, right? Good.
You can find a great explanation somewhere out there, I'm not sure who
wrote it and the thing was explaining why C++ is not a great choice
for the Linux kernel. Some things going against C++ will also go
against ObjC. I cannot find it, but it is out there somewhere.
I'm a newbie and I might be wrong, but the above is what I believe to be true.
