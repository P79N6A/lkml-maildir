What I will do over the next few days is split up the patch to little bits 
(seems to keep the kernel gods happier, cannot say I blame them) and then 
post that for you all to pull apart and mull over?

My code records the number of both the total idle ticks and the overall ticks
at the last interval.  This means if I subtract those values for the ones at
the next interval I can work out what the 'cpu use' is over that period thats
just passed by looking at the percentage difference between (total-idle) and 
if it trips the expected values if an increase or decrease in frequency was 
needed.
This is really the main reason why the polling interval has to be decreased 
by a large amount (I make it occur 50 times fewer times) so the period does 
not get skewed by *very* brief cpu spikes.

Well in the fashion of the netfilter folk, "Works for Me(tm)" :)  Sitting 
there with 'watch' on /sys/.../ondemand/requested_freq seems to return 
perfectly sane results.

I'll split this out as I think it should be in there.

I have been chatting to a few people and on desktop machines this is the
behaviour they of course prefer.  Overshoot and then pull down.  However all
us laptop users have a crotch to protect :) We (well four people out of the
*whole* linux community; better than a US poll I hear though) we prefer a
overly conservative approach; hence my approach.  I did write it to suit more
my needs obviously :)

guess the world domination plans go back to....
1. steal all the pants....
2. ....
3. rule the world
I do though think the step_freq bit should be there.

Not a problem.  I'm in a 'powersaving' mode so will race you if you want to
produce those patches :) After that I have to tell 'wmpower' its a Bad
Idea(tm) to suck up 5% cpu time to poll for the whole ACPI state every 0.5s
with a host of other major issues :-/ Then there is....and...<complains to
himself>
Cheers all
