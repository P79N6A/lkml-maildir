I just build a kernel with everything special disabeled:  no APIC
support, no Athlon specific code (set i386), no AMD specific chipset
code (neither IDE/DMA nor AGP/DRI), no PM, no nothing... 
...and it still refuses to reboot -- so the code change which
prevents my system from rebooting must be anywhere in some quite
generic code.  But where could this be?
Any tips, hints or comments would still be highly appreciated!
Please cc me in any reply, I'm not subscribed to the lkml.
