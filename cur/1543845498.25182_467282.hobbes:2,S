The one with ld.so you mean? But its a user-space issue,
I haven't seen anyone claiming the opposite (and you even
explicitly confirmed it is).

But noone have answered this question:
Which configuration is more secure - the one where all
the user-writable fs are mounted with "noexec" (in old
sense of noexec), or the one without "noexec" at all
because I should no longer use it here and there (actually,
everywhere)?

I can't think of a single real-life example where it will
break something over whatever is broken already by the mmap
check. But I am not encouraging such a change of course.
