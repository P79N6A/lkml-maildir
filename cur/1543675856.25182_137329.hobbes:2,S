I am CC'ing linux-kernel as that is the general kernel list.  There
may be something even more focused on IDE issues but I am
not aware of it.

Yes.  But it is baroque.

Not exactly.  The method is essentially you ping the drives to see
if they are there.

Nope this information is not stored in registers.

No.
But there is also nothing that allows you to force the module
order within the kernel.  So there are no guarantees you will
come before a normal IDE driver.  I assume from the questions
you intend to have this working in the linux kernel.
