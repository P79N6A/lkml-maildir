'unknown' is the output from uname -p, host processor type.  That field
is not supported in the Linux kernel.  uname.c in sh-utils has this
#if defined (HAVE_SYSINFO) && defined (SI_ARCHITECTURE)
  if (sysinfo (SI_ARCHITECTURE, processor, sizeof (processor)) == -1)
    error (1, errno, _("cannot get processor type"));
#else
  strcpy (processor, "unknown");
#endif
HAVE_SYSINFO is always false in sh-utils and SI_ARCHITECTURE is not
defined in glibc so you always get unknown.
