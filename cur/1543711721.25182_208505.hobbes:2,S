To quote jan harkes, who repiled to my original proposal:
"Inode number are not necessarily unique per filesystem. Any filesystem
that uses iget4 can have several objects that have the same inode
number. For instance, Coda uses 128-bit file-identifiers and the i_ino
number is a simple hash that is 'typically' unique. There are also
filesystems that invent inode numbers whenever inodes are brought into
the cache, but which have no persistency when the inode_cache is pruned.
So the next time you see the same object, it could have a different
(unique) inode number."
But I think the current approach is much better anyway since it does 
work for a single directory and its subdirectories instead of globally 
like my initial attempt. If you want to catch hard link issues you will 
have to watch the root of the file system, but that is still not that 
expensive. And on "sane" file systems that use unique inode numbers in 
userspace to solve the hard link problem.

Rüdiger
