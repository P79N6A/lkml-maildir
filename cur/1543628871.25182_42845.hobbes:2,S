Then i understood it right. I hope your change is made in this way only for the 2.5 tree.
Changing all drivers is ok for 2.5, but most third party driver supplier update their drivers
only rarely.

I think your solution is ok for 2.5 but not for 2.4. On the 2.4 series it would be easier to
add a flag which is set if the driver is VLAN ready. This wouldn't break third party drivers,
which are not VLAN ready. And vconfig would report the right thing without changing any
driver code (as it was intended by one of my former postings).
