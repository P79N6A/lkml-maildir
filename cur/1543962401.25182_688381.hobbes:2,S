You can try netconsole: see Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt for 
details on how to set it up.  It may not always work.  Obviously a 
failure in the networking code may not be reported correctly.  But it 
will try its best.
I just use netcat on a separate system to listen on a specific port and 
redirect to a file:
netcat -lu -p 6666 > logfile
This tells netcat to listen, UDP, port 6666.
Then, on the test system, I load the netconsole module with option:
netconsole=@/,@192.168.4.60/00:17:31:98:77:2f
on boot.  After this point every kernel message is logged to the logfile 
via netcat.  You can also build netconsole in and specify the options on 
the boot command line.  But if you do this obviously you need to build 
in your network card driver, as well :)
Hope that helps.
Cheers,
Dan
