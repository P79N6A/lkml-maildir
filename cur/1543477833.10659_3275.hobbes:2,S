   Agreed, it will make the code more robust with a tiny overhead. I repost
   here the _whole_ fix for the bottom-half-function SMP races. I think this
   should go in fast to avoid maintainers of other archs to fix things two
   times ;)
This patch looks strangely like what 32-bit sparc has been doing all
along. :-)
