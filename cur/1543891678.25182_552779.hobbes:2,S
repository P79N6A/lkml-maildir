ketchup already breaks with the current rt9 patch. 
lapdog{rt}$ ketchup -n 2.6-rt
None -> 2.6.21.3-rt9
Unpacking linux-2.6.21.tar.bz2
Applying patch-2.6.21.3.bz2
Applying patch-2.6.21.3-rt9
lapdog{rt}$ head `which ketchup`
#!/usr/bin/python
#
# ketchup 0.9.8
# 
http://selenic.com/ketchup/wiki
As noted before rt9 is based one 2.6.21 so after ketchup brings the directory 
to 2.6.21.3 then applying rt9 fails.
I would appreciate it if you base the rtX patch on the kernel you list as a 
prefix of that patch.  It helps us that use ketchup and it just makes sense.
