Actually the volatiles might be still useful. Or if you drop them
at least add memory clobbers. I had sometimes bugs  on x86-64
with the compiler moving such assembly statements with invisible 
side effects around too aggressively and causing weird problems.
Agreed on the underscores, I hate them too :)
