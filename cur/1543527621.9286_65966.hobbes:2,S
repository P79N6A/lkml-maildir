RAM size has nothing to do with it. I seen the arguments about hwo many
is actually needed. The best thing would be to let teh user decided like
we do with UNIX98 ptys.

Thats alot of memory. I can see seperate scrollback for each head.

This is possible now. If people created more text hardware modes for their 
vidoe cards. Note many modern card no longer a VGA core. Thats the very
reason why we have fbcon.

See other post about hardware panning. A userland app can handle this
(screen).

Sorry if you want to take advantage of TEXT hardware modes you need to
know something about the video hardware.

Then screen has problems. Remember KISS for the console system. We want a
bare bone system. Yet it has just enough of a good design that userland
can build on it.

No problem. I see its time to soon start a linux-console developement
soon.
