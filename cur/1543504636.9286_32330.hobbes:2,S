This is quite likely if you're restoring short names where the long name
restore has generated the wrong shortnames. 
This says nothing about access from standard UNIX commands, they would only
ever see or write long names, short names would be even more invisable than 
inode numbers.

Short File Name backup  of course :-)

The user uses wildcards like (s)he would on a real unix filesystem ...
$ cd Prog*
or even

Use wildcards - or arn't you that lazy ? :-)

The problem with mount options is they are just that, you have to remount
the filesystem to change them, and it might not be very easy at that moment.
The ioctls give you enough control so that a particular program can change
it's own view, or have it changed through a LD_PRELOAD shared library.
There is one more thing ... for consistancy it'd be reasonable for the ioctls
to work on an MSDOS filesystem too, to access the hidden long names.
