Compressing filesystems like jffs2 and logfs gain better compression
ratio with larger blocks.  Going from 4KiB to 64KiB gave somewhere
around 10% benefit iirc.  Testdata was a 128MiB qemu root filesystem.
Granted, the same could be achieved by adding some extra code and a few
bounce buffers to the filesystem.  How suck a hack would perform I'd
prefer not to find out, though. :)
