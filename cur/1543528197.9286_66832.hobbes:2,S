1.) this is a samba issue, not a kernel issue. not really an admin issue,
either, but hey.
2.) It's a question of encrypted vs plain-text passwords; win98 and later
versions of 95 send encrypted passwords, while early 95 sends a plain text
password. your samba is configured to use one or the other. see
ENCRYPTION.txt and the other samba docs.
