I guess I live in a different world.  I do lots of things I'm not 
"supposed" to do.
Moreover, it is very sensible and usable to mprotect malloc pages.  I 
have implemented simple sandboxing this way.  For my dissertation I 
implemented a DSM by mprotect'g malloc'd memory.  This system worked for 
 >6 on several version of Linux and SunOS.  I actually have a better 
track record for this technique than for some things that are within the 
specifications.
