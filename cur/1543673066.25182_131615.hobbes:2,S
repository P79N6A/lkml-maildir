OK, the full messages on starting kscd up are:

sector 0

That is with no disc in the drive; the drive identifies itself as:
'Pioneer DVD-ROM ATAPIModel DVD-116 0109' and driver is 
'ide-cdrom version 4.59-ac1' (in 2.5.69)
But to be honest, my observation is more general - I'm sure I've seen
similar messages from VMware on systems (this system does not have it)
and other things rattling the CD drive on older kernels.  In general I
think I'd just like to tell IDE to be quiet about certain drives so it
makes it easier to spot serious errors in the logs.
