Several reasons.
One is just plain confusion - anybody who uses cdrecord has either been
confused by the silly SCSI numbering (while "dev=/dev/hdc" is not
confusing at all, and uses the same device you use for mounting the thing
etc).
Another is that several things did _not_ work well with ide-scsi. Some
people ended up having to boot with ide-scsi enabled to burn CD's, but
then if they wanted to watch DVD's (on the same drive), they needed to
boot without it.

And you liked the fact that you were supposed to write "dev=0,0,0" or
something strange like that? What a piece of crap it was.
