Subject: [patch] wake-one FIFO semaphores

This patch will make the semaphore wakeup a FIFO wake-one wakeup.
Please note the comment at the top of the patch (the only delicate issue
wrt this wake-one change). The i386 arch is just fine in such respect.
I believe this is the right thing do to also considering that the current
wakeup is basically a LIFO wakeup in SMP (in UP instead it will take care
of the priority inversion issue: it will be the scheduler that will choose
the task to run). But as I anticipated above in SMP once we started the
first blocked process sleeping in the waitqueue (in the middle of
__wake_up), then such blocked process will _just_ run on the other CPU
while we continue to wakeup other tasks (plain LIFO).
So this is not only a performance improvement, but IMHO it's also an
enforcement to better avoid semaphore starvation in SMP systems.

Continuing on the wake-one thing, IMHO in accept() we want a LIFO
behaviour (we don't care at all if some of the apache clients will sleep
forever... or better we _care_ that most of them will sleep all the time
;), so IMHO it doesn't make too much sense to wait for doing some real
workload to choose between LIFO and FIFO in such place. But the problem is
that it's not possible right now to implement a LIFO wakeup in accept(2)
due the current TASK_EXCLUSIVE implementation.
I agree that it's nice to stop browsing the waitqueue at the first
TASK_EXCLUSIVE task (so doing really a wakeup in O(1)), but doing so we
can't really do a LIFO wakeup without breaking in two parts the sk->sleep
waitqueue: one waitqueue for accept() with only EXCLUSIVE tasks inserted
in not exlusive order, and one separate for select().
