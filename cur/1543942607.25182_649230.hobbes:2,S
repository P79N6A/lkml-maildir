I think we can get away with not adding an engine_type field:
1/ For a given platform there will usually only be one driver active.
For example I have an architecture (IOP) specific dma_copy_to_user
implementation that can safely assume it is talking to the iop-adma
driver since ioat_dma and others are precluded by the Kconfig.
2/ If there was a situation where two dma drivers were active in a
system you could tell them apart by comparing the function pointers,
i.e. dma_device1->device_prep_dma_memcpy !=
dma_device2->device_prep_dma_memcpy.
