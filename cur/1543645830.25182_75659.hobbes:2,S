bad luck, the disappearance of the bug was rather accidental - I have
switched to a different swap partition in the meantime. So backing out
the changes doesn't make the bug reappear, restoring previous IDE
configuration does.
Very likely interrupt related trouble, somewhere a missing spinlock_irqsave 
perhaps. The bug manifests itself so that pages from wrong procesess get 
swapped in for some process, however I have also had the luck to crash the 
kernel (no Oops) so it is not likely to be one of the TLB/cache problems.
What strikes me is that is always related to swap and I 've never got any
strange dmesg so far.
