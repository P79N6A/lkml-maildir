Subject: Building WAN card driver as monolythic (3rd round)

Hello,
This is the 3rd round on this problem (and we did have improvements !! :).
The current status is:
- In kernel 2.3.x, the driver works as a module and as a monolythic driver 
  with no problems at all;
- In kernel 2.2.x, the driver works as a module with no problems at all;
- In kernel 2.2.x, the _same_ driver that works as a module has problems 
  when built as monolythic;
In the only situation that the driver does not work (2.2.x, monolythic), I
could see that the sppp_rcv function (which calls sppp_input) is NEVER
called. I don't understand why, considering that:
- the _same_ code works when the driver is compiled as a module;
- the only differences in the driver from module to monolythic are in the 
  device detection / initialization phase;
- the _sync card driver_ is able to send _AND_ receive packets from the
  hardware. It calls netif_rx in case of a received packet (I'm sure
  about this, as I placed printk's on the netif_rx function in 
  linux/net/core/dev.c). However, the syncppp driver never sees those
  packets ...
What could cause this problem ?? The only difference I see here is that
the syncppp / pc300 drivers are built into the kernel when the problem
happens, so they are initialized earlier. Could this be the problem??
Please help! :)
TIA and Regards,
Ivan
