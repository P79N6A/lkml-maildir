Which of the following is more readable:
/* try atomic lock inline, if that fails, spin out of line */
	"\tbtsl $1,%0\n"
	"\tbne 2f\n"
	"1:\n"
	"\t.section .text.lock\n\n"
	"\t2:\tcmpl $0,%0\n"
	"\tbne 2b\n"
	"\trep ; nop\n"
	"\tjmpl 1b\n\n"
	"\t.section .previous\n"
or:
/* try atomic lock inline, if that fails, spin out of line */
"	btsl $1,%0
1:
	.section .text.lock
2:	cmpl $0,%0
	bne 2b
	jmpl 1b
	.section .previous"
or:
	while (unlikely(test_and_set_bit(1, lock))) {
		while (lock.value)
			arch_pause();
	}
Ooops, sorry, ignore 3 -- that's only possible in a world where there is 
intrinsic support in the compiler to generate the assembly we're aiming 
for.  But of the two assembly versions, I think the second is much more 
readable.  The few gcc people I've spoken to locally about this agreed with 
me when I showed them some of the inline assembly bits in the two forms as 
above.
