It is not happy if you put 256GB into one zone. We are fine with 1k nodes 
with 8GB each and a 16k page size (which reduces the number of 
page_structs to manage by a fourth). So the total memory is 8TB which is 
significantly larger than 256GB.
If we do this node/zone merging and reassign MAX_ORDER blocks to virtual 
node/zones for containers (with their own LRU etc) then this would also 
reduce the number of page_structs on the list and may make things a bit 
easier.
We would then produce the same effect as the partitioning via NUMA nodes 
on our 8TB boxes. However, then you still have a bandwidth issue since 
your 256 likely only has a single bus and all memory traffic for the 
node/zones has to go through this single bottleneck. That bottleneck does 
not exist on NUMA machines.
