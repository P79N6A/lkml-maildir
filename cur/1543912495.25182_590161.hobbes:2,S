And the real test of whether someone is a good engineer or a dodgy
consultant then follows. The engineer says "no" the consultant says
"it'll cost ya" ;)
Humour aside don;t knock the people who have the ideas - in amongst all
the people wanting something that is insane are aluable pieces of
information if you can ever work them out - What they actually *want*
to be able to do, and sometimes ideas that are ones people used to the
technology wouldn't have - most are silly but just occasionally you get
the "that would be silly, we'd have to umm, interesting maybe we could,
I'll get back to you" type ideas.
