I have a Shuttle AN35N-Ultra with an Athlon 2600+ on it which had the
infamous lockups under 2.4 until I figured out that it was the APIC and
turned that off.  I just flashed the BIOS with the latest on Shuttle's site
and they seem to have gone, at least for now.  Someone claims that he got
one after five days uptime, but I'm a wimp and turn my computer off every
night so I'll never see that.
