I'd rather not store such policy things on the file system permanently, and 
make it a mount option. I'm wondering how many installations this would 
affect; to me it seems that it's not worth a super block flag.
Eventually we will hopefully move to a more flexible xattr storage mechanism; 
that hack will then just become baggage.
