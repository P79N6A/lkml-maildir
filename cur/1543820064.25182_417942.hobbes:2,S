My thirst thought is:
Is this really the best approach, or could this be done better?
I'm currently more a fan of a separate kabi/ subdir with headers used by 
both headers under linux/ and userspace.
Why?
Unless I'm misunderstanding this, your changes are giving a result 
identical result to simply using the current kernel headers (stripping 
the #ifdef __KERNEL__ stuff doesn't change anything).
If we want to define an ABI and do it right, the resulting ABI headers
should be write-only, and should even continue to contain the ABI for
code already removed from the kernel.
It should be possible to do this incrementically:
- without breaking the kernel at any time
- with no userspace breakages when switching to the ABI headers for 
  userspace (there might be corner cases, and if e.g. the asm-i386/atomic.h
  abuse by MySQL breaks that's not a loss)
This might take a bit longer, but as a result we have:
- an ABI where diffstat is able to tell us if someone has touched the ABI
  (can git trigger electric shocks for everyone trying to commit or pull 
   changes to the kabi/ subdir?  ;-)  )
- as a side effect, some cleanup of the current kernel headers
Unless someone can tell me a reason why this wouldn't work (except for 
being a bit more work than your approach), this is the approach I have 
in mind for working on.
