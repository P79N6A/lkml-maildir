dentry only contains the inode, not the fh.  On the server, the inode
can go away and come back as a new fh, but with the same inode.  Is
that detectable (would comparison hooks have to be added?)?  Although,
I guess the inode is enough; you can do an NFS_I(inode)->fh to get
the fh, but I wouldn't guess you'd want that in the VFS.  Bah, here
I go again ... forgive me if that's nonsense.

You could disallow rename if DCACHE_NFSFS_RENAMED is set.  That would
be easy and makes sense as an "ok" thing to do.  I mean, if you're not
going to allow unlinking of a sillyrenamed file, you may as well disallow
rename as well.
If that's not desirable (again, seems ok to me ... speaking as just a user)
then hey, in rename you just need to check the nfs_delete_queue.

OK, where else besides rename would the dentry change?
