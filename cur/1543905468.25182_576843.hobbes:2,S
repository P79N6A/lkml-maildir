Welcome to the minefield.
This bitops and barrier stuff is complicated. It's very easy to
introduce bugs which are hard to trigger, or happen only with some
specific gcc versions, or only on massively parallel SMP boxes.
You can also make technically correct changes which relax needlessly
strict barrier semantics of some bitops and trigger latent bugs
in code which was unknowingly depending on it.
How you can proceed:
Make a change which you believe is right. Recompile allyesconfig
kernel with and without this change. Find a piece of assembly code
which become different. Check that new code is correct (and smaller
and/or faster). Post your patch together with example(s) of code
fragments that got better. Be as verbose as needed.
Repeat for each change separately.
This can be painfully slow, but less likely to be rejected outright
in fear of introducing difficult bugs.

I vaguely remember that "memory" clobbers are needed in some rather
obscure, non-obvious situations. Google for it - Linus wrote about it
to lkml (a few years ago IIRC).

Do you know any code difference resulting from this patch?

For this kind of things, you really need something more stressing.
Try to find big SMP people who is willing to give it a whirl.

At least it proves that _something_ changed.
