I think Manu is working on that. I don't have any status about this.
If you have any specific questions about DVB hardware, the best would be
to use linux-dvb@linuxtv.org Mailing List. This is a subscribers-only
list. If you are interested, you can subscribe via mailman web interface
at

.
Cheers,
Mauro.
