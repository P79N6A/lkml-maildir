Just FYI, I have also a working minimal VST patch for x86 based
on the OMAP VST patch Tuukka Tikkanen & I did a while back.
I'm hoping to post it real-soon-now(TM).
It currently works with PIT for programmable interrupts and TSC 
for updating time from. Adding more timers, such as PM timer 
should be easy.
I have not looked yet what can be merged with George's patch,
but I'll look at that after I get something posted first.
Regards,
Tony
