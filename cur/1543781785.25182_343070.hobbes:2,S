Wow, blast from the past!  This was one of the very first problematic
code paths Ingo and I identified in the early days of the voluntary
preempt patch (using the crude ALSA xrun debug mechanism which was the
best we had before /proc/latency_trace).
IIRC I was able to trivially reproduce it by leaving gtk-gnutella
running overnight with a few active searches/downloads.
