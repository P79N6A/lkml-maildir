It's actually quite broken in several areas (== bunch of panicable rmmod
races, broken wrt umount(), trivially oopsable in ioctl() on ramdisk,
very suspicious in swapoff(2), etc.).  It _might_ be fixable, but I
would really like to see the patch that went into -pre11 separately from
the rest.  Andrea, could you send it to me?  In particular, I'm deeply
suspicious about changes in blkdev_put() in case of BDEV_FILE.
