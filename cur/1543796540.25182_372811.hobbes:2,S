Looks good. However, I did not test this now since this did not apply to
netdev-2.6 (it does not have hostap_main.c). Did the hostap.c to
hostap_main.c rename go only to -mm? I would prefer to do this kind of
changes in a single place and I thought netdev-2.6 would be that. I'm
not following -mm tree at all and it would be easier to go through
patches if they are against netdev-2.6 upstream branch.
