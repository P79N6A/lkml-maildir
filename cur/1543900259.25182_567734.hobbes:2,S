Just changing the "From:" in pine (configured for my other account)
wouldn't solve the problem. I'd have to first forward the original mail
to my other account and/or copy it manually, which I'd like to avoid ...

Ok, I read through the relevant bits of that page, thanks. My box
here doesn't resolve smtp.gmail.com / pop.gmail.com and there
