Most definitely...  I have a small case (by choice) and no auxilliary fans
(aside from the CPU fans and the powers upply fan).  I am going back to a
single, non-overclocked CPU in an effort to keep ambient noise down.

It also should be noted again that the AGPset is easily capable of 100MHz
FSB as it is part of the BX chipset.  Why it's presenting a problem on the
BP6 is beyond me.

I have heard nothing about 'official' 100MHz FSB Celerons.  Are you
referring to the Coppermine chips?
Mike.
