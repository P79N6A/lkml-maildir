Apart from doing something it's supposed to for !CONFIG_MMU and using
the internal kernel accounting I set up for the CONFIG_MMU=y case I'm
not very concerned about this. I have a vague notion there should
probably be some consistency with the /proc/ precedent but am not
particularly tied to it. We should probably ask Greg Ungerer (the
maintainer of the external MMU-less patches) about what he prefers
since it's likely we can't anticipate all of the !CONFIG_MMU concerns.

I don't really know what the approach to app compatibility used by
userspace for !CONFIG_MMU is; I'll refer you to Greg Ungerer as my
knowledge of the CONFIG_MMU usage models and/or whatever userspace
is used in tandem with it outside the VM's internals is rather scant.
