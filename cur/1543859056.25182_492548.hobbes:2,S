Greg.
It appears commit d71374dafbba7ec3f67371d3b7e9f6310a588808 which
replaced the pci bus spinlock with a semaphore causes some systems not
to boot.  I haven't a clue why.   
So I figure I would toss the ball over to your court to see if you can
look and see what needs to happen to resolve this problem.
There appears to be at least one positive confirmation that reverting
this patch allows this patch fixes the problems.
