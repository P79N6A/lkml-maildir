Can't say for a definite fact that it was reiserfs but I can say for a 
definite fact that something fishy happens sometimes.
If I have a text file open, something.html comes to mind, If I edit it 
and save it in one rxvt and open it in another rxvt, my changes may not 
be there.  If I save it *again* or exit the editing process, I will see 
the changes in the second term.  No, I'm not accidently forgetting to 
save it, I know for a fact that I saved it and the first terminal shows 
the non-modified state with the changes and the second term shows the 
previous data.
Somewhere something is stuck in cache and what's on disk isn't what's in 
cache and a second process for some reason gets what is on disk and not 
what is in cache.
It happens infrequently but it -does- happen.
