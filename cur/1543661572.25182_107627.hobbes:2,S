Andrea,
The change from block_truncate_page to nobh_truncate_page was done in 
Changeset 1.879.43.1.  This was created on January 9th, but not merged 
into Linus' tree until Monday, so it is not in 2.5.59.  I think the 
date of the changeset preceding 2.5.59 is causing the confusion.
Thanks,
Shaggy
