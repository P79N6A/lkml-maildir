Yes, I agree with that suggestion, but I don't see a problem.
Did you look at his .config file?  It's here:

I'm comparing it to the .config on my Pentium-with-f00f-bug, which does
boot 2.5.65 successfully, and I don't see CPU option differences.
I see lots that don't matter and I see PIIX vs. VIA option differences.
Oh, and I have CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV enabled, while Robins does not.
Would that matter?
