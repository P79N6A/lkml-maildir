Well, in Linux there is no separate concept of threads, so each thread
is a separate process with it's own PID and the PPID of the main thread.
In fact pthread_create() sits just on top of clone().
The way each program handles multiple conections is up to the program,
for example apache 1.3 and below does a fork(), mozilla does a
pthread_create(), BOA does a select() in only one process, and apache
2.0 and up does both a fork() and pthread_create().
