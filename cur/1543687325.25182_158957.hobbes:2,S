Dear all,
  I'd like to announce publication of Linux Kernel State Tracer(LKST)
version 1.5, which is a tracer for Linux kernel.
  We release patches to support both IA32 and IA64 platforms.
And we provide watchdog handler and heartbeat program (addons).
#The details are described in changes-1.5.txt.
Remarks:
   To support IA64, we changed some codes in the following programs.
   - KernelHooks
   - LKCD

following site,
