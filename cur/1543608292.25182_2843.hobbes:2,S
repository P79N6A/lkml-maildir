Hi:
That is say: in 2.4.x, the max filesystem size of ext2 is 32T, and i
want know
what is the reiserfs(and others) max size ? and where the limitation
comes from(VFS layer)?
Maybe you can give some clue .
And the max file size now biger than 2G(is 16T), how reiserfs implement it?
Thanx a lot!
zmwillow
