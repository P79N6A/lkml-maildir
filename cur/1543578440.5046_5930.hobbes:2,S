I had a misconfigured swap partition: it went 480 blocks beyond the end of
the disk (last partition, SCSI, OSF/1 disklabels, Alpha).  mkswap -c
reported bad pages, and the kernel said IO error in the log on the last
mumble blocks.
When this system started to swap, the processes would just go into the D
state, and then vmstat, ps, top, et al. would go D.  Now, of course the
problem was that the swap partition was bigger than the physical media,
but there was no error message at all, just procs stuck in D.
Probably there should be an error message, or something.
