tick adjustments are considered obsolete, because if a lcok implementation (or 
hardware) is severly broken, users should reject using that stuff. Meaning: tick 
adjustments are ment to be set once in the life of a computer system. No 
continuous tuning.

Actually, you are compensating for a "tick problem" on a smaller scale (constant 
part), and variations caused by temperature, voltage, and others (variable part).

Yes, that's the "precise" variant of implementing it. Poor implementations are
