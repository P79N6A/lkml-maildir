Oh! I was refering to the other set of workqueue deadlock woes. The
ones caused when subsystems (like cpufreq) try to create/destroy
workqueue from the cpuhotplug callback path. 
Creation/destruction of workqueue requires us to take workqueue_mutex,
which would have already been taken during CPU_LOCK_ACQUIRE.
More often than not, the cpu hotplug protection that we need
is while accessing either cpu_online_map OR one of it's persubsystem
mirrors like policy->cpus. 
So it makes more sense to have all the persubsystem 
mutexes held only during the cpu-hotplug operation (i.e stop_machine_run
and __cpu_up) and release them immediately after sending notifications to
update the persubsystem online_cpu map.
Thanks and Regards
