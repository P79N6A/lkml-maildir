The "problem" is contributor names, although having everything in plain ASCII is resonable, I guess.

A lot of names and some art supposed to be ASCII.

Some degree symbols and microseconds... and names.
I remember having problems with lm-sensors trying to print degrees, how did they fight the problem?

Ok, this Japanese is only in the comments.

There are a few microseconds written properly, but may commonly by typed as us, or just don't use abbr.

Totally agree, although I use Mozilla Mail (and sometimes mutt).
