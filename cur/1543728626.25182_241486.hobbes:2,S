Here are all the log entries produced during this test:
rlrevell@mindpipe:~$ for test in 1 2 3 4 5; do echo; echo "Test $test";
jackd -n 100000 --realtime -d alsa --rate 48000 -D -P hw:0,0 -C hw:0,2
-p 32 -S >> mm2; done

When one jackd process is running, starting another jackd process, 
using a different device produces an xrun in the first.  If mlockall-test 
is run while a jackd process is running, this also produces an xrun in 
the jackd process.
So, it seems that if a SCHED_FIFO process opens a PCM device using mmap, 
then mlockall's the memory, then another process mlockall's memory, the 
result is an xrun 100% of the time.
