So a swapping problem with updatedb should be unusual and we'd like to see
if we can fix it without resorting to prefetching.
I know the theory behind swap prefetching, and I'm not saying it doesn't
work, so I'll snip the rest of that.

It isn't going to get fixed unless people complain about it. If you
cover the use-once problem with swap prefetching, then it will never
get fixed.

Anybody is free to merge anything into their kernel. And if somebody
asks for my issues with the swap prefetching patch, then I'll give
them :)
