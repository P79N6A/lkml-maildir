I don't think you will ever get good time if you EVER reprogramm the PIT.  That 
is why the VST patch on sourceforge does NOT touch the PIT, it only turns off 
the interrupt by interrupting the interrupt path (not changing the PIT).  This 
allows the PIT to be the "gold standard" in time that it is designed to be.  The 
wake up interrupt, then needs to come from an independent timer.  My patch 
requires a local APIC for this.  Patch is available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/high-res-timers/
