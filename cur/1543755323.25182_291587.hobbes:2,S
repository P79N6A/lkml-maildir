Normal process accounting.
If you want to keep the pid of the bio-parent, you also need to keep the
start-time to make it unique. Better would be to have a all-time-unqiue
process handle. But I think it is better to not have that field, but use
audit logs. That is especially needed if you want to track chains, because
it doesnt help you to know the bio parent if you have no idea what that was.
