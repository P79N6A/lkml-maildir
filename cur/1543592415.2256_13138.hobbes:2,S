Ok, I applied Andrea's (nee Ingo's) version, as that one most clearly
attacked the real deadlock cause. It's there as 2.4.5 now.
I'm going to be gone in Japan for the next week (leaving tomorrow
morning), so please don't send me patches - I won't be able to react to
them anyway. Consider the -ac series and the kernel mailing list the
regular communications channels..
Thanks,
