Some people believe bz2 to be buggy or otherwise less tolerant of 
corruption.  For most people these things don't seem to come up; I've 
never had problems with either despite frequent work with large 
compressed datasets.

Linus decided that patches will always be off the previous 
non-extraversion tarball.  Note that -rc3 is not relative to -rc2, so in 
that way its consistent.  The reason Linus gave is that such 
trivial-but-important bugfixes may come *after* the next version has 
releases or release cantidates, so this is the only sane way.  For 
example, if another tiny code bug motivated making a 2.6.8.2, the 
release cantidates shouldn't have to be rediffed.  Hopefully it makes 
sense now :)
