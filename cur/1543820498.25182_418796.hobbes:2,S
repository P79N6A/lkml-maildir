Ok, please document this throughout all AppArmor documentation and
literature.  It will be a source of great encouragement to users.

What is intended goes beyond what names are used - it involves the
actual objects.  When /bin/su asks to open /etc/shadow, it wants the
real system shadow password file, not just any old file to
which /etc/shadow might happen to resolve.  Further, even at this
"primary" goal, AppArmor does a poor job wrt to already existing
virtualization or jail mechanisms AFAICS.

No, it won't protect the data.  You can't have it both ways.  Either you
are only controlling the use of paths and not concerned with the objects
(if so, please document as such, but I can't imagine Crispin et al
admitting to such a position), or you are controlling the objects and
thus protecting the data.

Um, that's problematic then.  If I can't determine what cannot be
accessed, then I can never know whether I have achieved my protection
goals.

No, only the appearance of it.

Dollars to donuts that they won't be willing to document that AA doesn't
protect objects in their documentation.

Pathname resolution is fine, obviously.  Regenerating pathnames in the
kernel and using them as part of your mechanism is...interesting.  Don't
confuse the userspace configuration and kernel-user interface with the
internal mechanisms.  Should inotify be calling d_path internally for
reporting to userspace?

That is precisely what AppArmor does.

AA doesn't even do that - as most of the LSM hooks don't get the
vfsmount info propagated to them, they don't know what specific path
your application took to the file.

I don't see why you wouldn't use a jail-style mechanism if that is what
you want.
