Well, you're absolutely right about native Git being more focused on
tracking the final product.  However, there are tools growing up around
Git that attempt to give similar (although completely integrated with
Git) functionality of Quilt.  One such tool is Stacked Git (StGit)
http://www.procode.org/stgit/.
  Since i'm not actually a user myself,
I can't vouch for it, but it does have a responsive community around it
and seems to be providing what it set out to accomplish.
