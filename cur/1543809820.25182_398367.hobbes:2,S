I'm not too keen on calling it resizing, because that term is 
misleading.  The resizing is one way.  You can't later resize back. It's 
like a window that you can only close but never reopen.  We should call 
it "runtime incremental disabling", or RID.
I don't think we need RID in order to merge these patches.  RID can be 
merged later if people decide they want a special easy reclaim zone that 
could disappear at any moment.  I personally fall in the camp of wanting 
my zones I explicitly enabled to stay put and am opposed to RID.
If only somebody had presented a solution that was flexible enough to 
dynamically resize reclaimable and non-reclaimable both ways.
