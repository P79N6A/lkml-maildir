I guess that refers to me:-)
E-mail is fine, but the unfortunate reality is that due to simple
volume, it is lossy.  The reason we like bugzilla is that it never
forgets:-)
So thanks for taking the extra time to file a bug report
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4193
If it turns out that there is no way a generic solution
can handle the SNC Sony laptops, then I agree that a
platform specific wart is the only way to go.  But
it would be best if we can make the exotic Sony/SNC
look more generic to the user so that the user
(and the distro supporting them) don't need to learn
special things to handle this system.
thanks,
