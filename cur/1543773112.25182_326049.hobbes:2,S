Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.12-rc6: fix __rh_alloc()/rh_update_states() race in dm-raid1.c

Hello,
the attached patch fixes the bug in dm-raid1.c that
the region returned by __rh_alloc() may be freed while
it's in use.
__rh_alloc() write-unlocks the hash_lock after inserting the new region.
Though it read-locks the hash-lock just after that, it's possible
that the region was reclaimed by rh_update_states() as the region
was clean at the time.

     read_lock(hash_lock)
     <return the region>
