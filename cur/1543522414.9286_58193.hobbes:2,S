Subject: 2.2.14 makes X unstable

I've finally gotten around to upgrading both my workstation and
my laptop to use the 2.2.14 kernel from 2.2.12 which I've had
running on them since about the time 2.2.12 came about.  Since
I put 2.2.14 on them, they're both very unstable under X, with
either random apps under X or X itself just crashing without
warning.  (X reports a "signal 11" and drops back to a prompt.)
Unfortunately, since I spend all my time in X, I can't tell if
this is strictly related to running X on 2.2.14 or not.  I do
have a server running 2.2.13 that has an uptime of a few weeks
that hasn't been giving me any problem however.  (It's not running
X for anything.)
I'm fairly confident that my problems are related to 2.2.14 since
I can run booted with 2.2.14 for only a few hours at a time before
something crashes, but if I reboot back into 2.2.12 I can run for
days without any problems showing up.  (Of course, this might
just be because failures are less frequent under 2.2.12. I can't
say for sure that a failure WON'T happen, only that it hasn't.)
They have both basically been RedHat 6.0 machines with my own kernel 
configured and installed.  (Using 'make oldconfig' to carry over
the same configurations between kernels.) X is version 3.3.5.  In the
last week or so I've reinstalled the workstation with RedHat 6.1 to see
if new libraries, new binaries, etc, would help but it still has the
same problem with 2.2.14 being unstable and the same solution of 
continuing to run 2.2.12 making the machine stable again.
The laptop is:
Toshiba Satellite 4015CDS
P-II 266Mhz (Deschutes stepping 02)
96MB RAM
4GB IDE on PIIX controller
C&T 65555 video chipset w/2MB of RAM
The workstation is:
Dual celeron 450Mhz on a DFI mobo (P2/XBL I think)
256MB RAM
Adaptec 2940 Ultra-Wide SCSI
Diamond V770 AGP (TNT2 Ultra) with 32MB RAM
