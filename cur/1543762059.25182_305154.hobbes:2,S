For some Intel processors... Tom Vier just posted his cpuinfo which 
shows all of his processors, which he notes are in separate sockets, are 
identified as physical zero. I didn't find any Intel systems which 
lacked unique physical ID, but clearly that's not true everywhere.
It's not clear if that's bizarre practice on AMD system boards or if 
it's mis-reported. Of course Tom may be running a NUMA setup, in which 
case I won't guess what's expected to be displayed. I've added him to 
the CC list, in hopes of comment.
