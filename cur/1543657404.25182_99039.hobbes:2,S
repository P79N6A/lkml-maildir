dev_kfree_skb_any() can misdetect the context: You must not use the 
function if you hold an irq spinlock and you might be running from BH or 
process context.
cpu 1:    cpu 2:
acquire one of the networking bh lock
             acquire the driver spin_lock_irq()
hardware interrupt
try to acquire the driver irq spinlock
--> spin.
              dev_kfree_skb_any(): !in_irq(), calls kfree_skb
              kfree_skb tries to acquire the network lock that
              cpu 1 owns
              --> spin.
And deadlock.
