First - do you think it's more likely to have a problem with the cycle
counter than to lose a tick?
Second - there is hardware that can't be fixed, and that needs to have
interrupts disabled for more than 10 ms to work. Yes, for example the MS
SideWinder 3D Pro joystick .... (during the initialization, and subsequent
re-initializations).
