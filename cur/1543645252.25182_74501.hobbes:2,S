Note that ATI now has a binary driver available that supports the 8500,
written by their German development group.  Available via their standard
"find a driver" page, using Linux as OS.  See, for example,
http://mirror.ati.com/support/products/pc/radeon8500/linux/radeon8500linuxdrivers.html?cboOS=LinuxXFree86&cboProducts=RADEON
+8500LE&cmdNext=GO%21
The scripts that build a kernel module and link it against their library
work pretty well and are, to their credit, not impossibly tied to one
distro over another.  :-)  I run Slackware.
