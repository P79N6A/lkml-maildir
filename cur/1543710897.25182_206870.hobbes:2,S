Yes, thanks! This is also fixed in mainline by now.
Ths leads me to the next error:
sound/sparc/cs4231.c: In function `snd_cs4231_pcm':
sound/sparc/cs4231.c:1573: error: `SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_PCI' undeclared (first use in this function)
sound/sparc/cs4231.c:1573: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sound/sparc/cs4231.c:1573: error: for each function it appears in.)
sound/sparc/cs4231.c:1575: error: parse error before numeric constant
SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_PCI used to be defined in <sound/memalloc.h> but is now
gone.
