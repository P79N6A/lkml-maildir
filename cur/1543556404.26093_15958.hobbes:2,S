Where can this Lucent driver be found?  The one I use with my Thinkpad is
version 5.68.  It comes as a loadable module (ltmodem.o) with no serial.c, and I
havent gotten it to work with any kernel later than 2.2.14.

This is currently happening with lucent winmodem driver: there's
modified version of serial.c, and customers are asked to compile it
and (staticaly-)link it against proprietary code to get usable
driver. Is that okay or not?
