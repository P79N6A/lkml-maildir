Well, I don't think it's unfixable.  But a full fix would, I think,
require a kernel thread for each callback invokation.  As dicussed
earlier, this could be optimised to only create the new kernel thread
if the keventd thread is presently off doing something else.
Is work_on_cpu() valuable enough to justify doing all that?  Dunno.
It appears to have six callers in three drivers at present, which is
quite a large number.
Or perhaps there's a smarter way of fixing it all.
