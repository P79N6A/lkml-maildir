Not necessarily.  If you're going to build kernels with distcc then you
need the same toolchain on all machines, so you probably build it with
crosstool.
Or if you want a consistent, tested, internally-maintained build
environment then you use a specific toolchain so your developers aren't
dependent on whatever their distro happened to put in /usr/bin
