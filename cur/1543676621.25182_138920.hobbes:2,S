   i imagine marking vcc->dev = NULL would be pretty close to the above.
Yep.  That'd work.
   (see latest rfc patch).
You do know that won't compile with current 2.5.x right?
All the struct sock members got renamed to have a "sk_" prefix
2 days ago :-)
But I did like the general direction you were going in.  I can't
comment on things like getting rid of ATM_*_ITF or whatever it's
called because I don't know what that thing does ;)
