And I'm tired of having people tell me, or tell others to buy a
faster computer or more RAM to work around a real technical
problem.  If a dual 1Ghz system with 1Gb of RAM and 60GB of disk
space broken across 3 U160 drives is not a modern fast
workstation I don't know what is.  My 300Mhz system however works
on its own stuff, and doesn't need upgrading.

Precicely, which underscores what I'm saying: The problem is
acknowledged, and being worked on by talented hackers knowing
what they are doing - so why must people keep saying "get more
disk space, it is cheap?" et al.?  That is totally nonuseful
advice in most cases.  Many have pointed out already for example
how impossible that would be in a 500 computer webserver farm.

I agree with you.  What I want, is when someone talks about this
stuff or inquires about it, for people to stop telling them that
their computer is out of date and they should upgrade it as that
is bogus advice.  "It worked fine yesterday, why should I
upgrade" reigns supreme.

It's not like there is someone forcing you to read it though.

Point noted, however that isn't going to stop anyone from
speaking their personal opinion on things.  Freedom of speech.
