Subject: cdrom related kernel panic

Dear all:
Im using 2.6.0-test2 here (celeron 1.7mhz, 128mb ram and ide cdrom) and
today I experienced reproducible freezes when reading the cdrom.
Everything started when I wanted to get the md5 sum of the cd in the
drive, so I did
md5sum /dev/cdrom
and after some minutes everything froze. I was under X  so I didn't saw
the kernel message.
I rebooted and did the same and it froze again.
Then, I did:
cat /dev/cdrom > /dev/null
in the console and I saw the kernel panic.
I've no idea how to capture that message, since the system is frozen, but
I can write down some data, if you need.
Thanks in advance
