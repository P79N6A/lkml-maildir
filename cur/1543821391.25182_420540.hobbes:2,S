I am working on reviewing / applying fixes to the comments, and will
send you a clean patch set when done.
The only non-IB dependency is in the iSCSI updates for 2.6.18. The git 
from which those updates are pushed upstream is scsi-misc-2.6 . Now, 
James have accepted into it 5/6 of the updates (see below) but there's 
still one which is not there yet. I will let you know.
