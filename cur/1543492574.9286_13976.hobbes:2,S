As you may or may not know, we here at BitMover are checking in all the
tarballs into a BitKeeper repository.  BitKeeper supports the concept of
named lines of development, or releases.  That means that we need nifty
names for each of the following branches (which you can see graphically
at 
http://www.bitkeeper.com/history
 )
	0.*
	1.0.*
	1.1.*
	1.2.*
	1.3.*
	2.0.*
	2.1.*
	2.2.*
The names should be short because you will see them when you browse the tree
(check out 
http://www.bitkeeper.com/lod
 for a screenshot of the browser - this
page is lame but I'll fix it up and include it as part of the screen shots
section of the bitkeeper home page).
So let's have some fun with this, but try for short names.  My wife just
suggested we could name them after Linux kernel hackers or other Unix
luminaries (though her suggestion to name one of the unstable ones "RMS"
might not be the greatest idea - on the other hand, he _has_ been asking 
for recognition :-)
So here's a strawman proposal, what do you think?
	0.*	tso
	1.0.*	drew
	1.1.*	hawes
	1.2.*	sct
	1.3.*	ingo
	2.0.*	alan
	2.1.*	linus
	2.2.*	davem
