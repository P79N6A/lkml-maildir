Hello members of the kernel-list,
I'm new to this and hope I don't misuse the list in any way.
Doing the update from debian sarge to etch on my server I ran into the
bug documented here: bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7177
I already made some comments there. I tried to contact the maintainer of
the DAC960 driver but as far as I found out, Leonard N. Zubkoff
unfortunatly died in a helicopter crash.
Without being impious, I want to ask if anybody can give me an idea of
how this thing will go on. Is there anybody new doing the maintaining?
Is there hope for a fix? Where can I find more information? Can I do
anything to help (testing, logging)?
regards,
Boris Andratzek
