http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/x.bz2
 is a patch against
-rc4 containing everything in -mm up to and including 
...
radix-tree-code-consolidation
radix_tree-early-termination-of-tag-clearing
radix-tree-reduce-tree-height-upon-partial-truncation
slob-introduce-mm-utilc-for-shared-functions
slob-introduce-the-slob-allocator
slob-introduce-the-slob-allocator-fixes
cpuset-better-bitmap-remap-defaults
cpuset-mempolicy-one-more-nodemask-conversion
cpuset-memory-pressure-meter
cpuset-memory-pressure-meter-gcc-295-fix
cpuset-document-additional-features
So a patch against that will be ideal.
(It's very easy for me to create such a rollup - one has but to ask...)
