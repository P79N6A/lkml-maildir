I don't have detailed instructions to hand, but here's a brief outline
of the procedure...
 1. Install favourite operating system.
 2. Install serial terminal emulator software.
 3. Install null modem between logger computer and computer being
    logged.
 4. Run serial emulator software. Set it to use highest reliable
    baud rate at 8N1 (8 data bits, No parity, 1 Stop bit). The
    relevant baud rate is as follows, and the LOWEST speed chosen
    for the IC's at both ends should be used.
	UART IC		Max Safe Speed
	~~~~~~~		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	 8250		   19,200 Baud
	14450		   57,600 Baud
	14550		  115,200 Baud
	14750		Unknown
    Note that all of the above chips CAN be operated at higher Baud
    rates, but the above are the highest speeds that at considered
    safe for logging purposes.
 5. Tell the emulator software to capture all incoming text to disk,
    in a specified file. Make sure the partition this file will be
    on is plenty large enough - the more the merrier.
 6. Set up computer being logged to log to the serial port, then
    reboot it into the serial logging mode.
 7. At regular intervals, and at least once a week, go to the logging
    computer, tell it to close the current logging file and open a
    new one. Repeat this stage Ad Nauseum...
 > As I said, a simple question, thanks in advance
No problem.
Best wishes from Riley.
