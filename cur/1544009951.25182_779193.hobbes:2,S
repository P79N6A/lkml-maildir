Then I have no other idea what to try.
Whether the Ricoh R5C832 FireWire controller or another device issues
the interrupt is IMO still not clear.  If it was the FireWire
controller, then it would be fundamentally broken.  ohci1394_pci_suspend
performs actually two register writes which both independently disable
interrupts on the controller, and I have a hard time to believe that the
controller gets both of these straight-forward things wrong.
