No, that's different.  You are referring to stat.st_blksize.  That is a
different animal, and we can leave that alone.
inode->i_blksize is equal to (1 << inode->i_blkbits) always, all the time. 
It is just duplicated nonsense and usually leads to poorer code -
multiplications instead of shifts.
It should be a pretty easy incremental set of patches to ease i_blksize out
of the kernel.
