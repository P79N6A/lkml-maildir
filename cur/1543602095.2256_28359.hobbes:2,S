The so-called Athlon patch fixed the problem for me on my Abit KK266R
board, I stress tested it at 146MHz FSB (10% o/c) just to see if it was
stable, and it seems all the problems have gone away in both kernel and
user land.
It could be that the bit cleared slows memory, I haven't checked to see if
playing with memory parameters will do the same thing.
