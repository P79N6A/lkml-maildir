How about having two pointers per task:
- exec_bc, which is the one used for charging
- real_bc, which is the task's actual beancounter
at the start of irq, do
current->exec_bc = &init_bc;
at the end of irq, do
current->exec_bc = current->real_bc;
When moving a task to a different bc do:
task->real_bc = new_bc;
atomic_cmpxchg(&task->exec_bc, old_bc, new_bc);
(with appropriate memory barriers). So if the task is in an irq with a
modified exec_bc pointer, we do nothing, otherwise we update exec_bc
to point to the new real_bc.
