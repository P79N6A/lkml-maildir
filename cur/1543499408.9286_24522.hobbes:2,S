My solution wasn't intended to solve a problem with non-continuous memory
regions for low memory machines. I need to solve the problem for machines
with 16MB+ memory. I have big trouble with my 128MB machine - there is not
often free any DMA page.

Could you say me what's wrong with my solution (two independent page
pools)? There are some things to discuss: When the system have up to 16MB
memory, the system should use only one pool for pages (on other side, it
may be good to have reserved some DMA pages). The size of the DMA memory
pool should be configurable.
I think that my solution give us better results than your with
try_to_free_pages() fiddling, because there will be always possibility to
have some pages locked for some reason when they are mixed one another,
thus they can't be freed.
