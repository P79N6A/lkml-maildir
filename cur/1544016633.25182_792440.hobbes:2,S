The USB charge pump should be enabled if DA9030 should supply USB VBUS for USB
devices connected to PXA OHCI port. In the most simple case, when the USB port
is configured to be host only the platform data can be used to setup the charge
pump once and forget about it. However, if the USB port is configured as OTG,
the charge pump should be toggled depending on OTG ID.
In EM-X270 I have a GPIO connected to OTG ID pin of the connector and according
to the GPIO state I toggle the da9030 USB charge pump.
