Hi
This bug has appeared in the past too 
(eg. 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2030
 ), for me it triggers
only when using a broadcom driver and then trying b44 without a cold reset 
or using the workaround in the bug report that runs a part of bcm4400 
initialization process.
Another known bug has been seen when using 4G/4G split and having 
> 1G of memory (
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=118165
, bugzilla is broken currently tho), but if you have more than a gig
mem=900M or whatnot is worth a try in any case.
Since it works perfectly (tm) on my hardware assuming I never load bcm4400 I
haven't put that much effort in tracking the reason what magic
"break b44 bit" bit broadcom drivers  set. I suppose I could give it a few 
hours this weekend tho... On some machines (I think dells) the timeout
waiting for 428 appears to happen even without bcm4400 getting loaded
so finally tracking this down would be really nice...
