CAP_SETUID is the appropriate capability...
This is not a dimension we have not fully explored.
What is the problem with a user controlled mount having different
uid and gid values.
Yes they map into different users but how is this a problem.
The only problem that I can recall is the historic chown problem
where you could give files to other users and mess up their quotas.
Or is the problem other users writing to this user controlled
filesystem?
