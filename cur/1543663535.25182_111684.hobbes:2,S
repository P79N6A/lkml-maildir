My opinion has nothing to do with it, go benchmark them and see for
yourself.  I'm in a pretty good position to back up my statements with
data, we support BitKeeper on AIX, Solaris, IRIX, HP-UX, Tru64, as well
as a pile of others, so we have both the hardware and the software to
do the comparisons.  I stand by statement above and so does anyone else
who has done the measurements.  It is much much more pleasant to have
Linux versus any other Unix implementation on the same platform.  Let's
keep it that way.

"fixing it", huh?  Your "fixes" may be great for your tiny segment of 
the market but they are not going to be welcome if they turn Linux into
BloatOS 9.8.

Thanks for the vote of confidence.  I think the thing to focus on, 
however, is that *noone* has ever succeeded at what you are trying 
to do.  And there have been many, many attempts.  Your opinion, it
would appear, is that you are smarter than all of the people in all
of those past failed attempts, but you'll forgive me if I'm not 
impressed with your optimism.

Really?  How about some figures?  You'd need HUGE profit margins to 
justify your position, how about some actual hard cold numbers?
