Subject: 2.6.0-test4-mm5 SMP got stuck when configuring the NIC

test4-mm5 seems to work on UP, but got stuck on SMP when the
initscripts ran pump.
It responded to sysrq+S, & sysrq+U,
so it seems block io was still working.
There was no fsck on the next boot into plain 2.6.0-test4.
sysrq+P showed:
Pid 38, comm: pump
EIP at __mod_timer+0x34/0x270
do_IRQ
common_interrupt
del_timer
del_timer_sync
schedule_timeout
process_timeout
dev_close
dev_change_flags
devinet_ioctl
inet_ioctl
sock_ioctl
syscall_call
auth_domain_drop
sysrq+T
showed pump as the R process, syslogd Z, and others S.
I'll try without the elv-insertion-fix thing later today.
