Good points.

Ick.  Let's go with (1).  A quick review of the adm1026_set_* functions 
doesn't seem to turn up any other situations where unextracted hardware 
defaults should cause any problems.  In all other cases where a set
function depends on data->* values that may not have been set, the
data->* value default of 0 results in the desired behavior.
So let's just have the adm1026_init_client() function read the hardware
fan divisor values and store them in fan*_div.

The amount of duplicated code is only a few lines, and I think the result is
clearer if it is not extracted into a separate function.  See the following
patch.
