Hum, "wrong" was maybe not the good word.... but kqueue_dequeue_ready() uses a 
spinlock (ready_lock) to protect ready_list. One particular struct kevent is 
given to one thread, one at a time.
If you look at fs/eventpoll.c, you can see how carefull is ep_send_events() so 
that multiple threads can in the same time transfer different items to user 
memory.
In a model where several threads are servicing events collected by a single 
point (epoll, or kevent), this is important to not block all threads because 
of a single thread waiting a swapin (trigered by copy_to_user() )
