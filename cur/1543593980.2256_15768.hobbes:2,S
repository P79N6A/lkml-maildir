I encountered the same problem after 2.4.3-ac6.

So you put your IBM drive on the promise, right?
Removing the hard disc from the promise controller and attaching it on the
VIA-Controller solved my problems. The system is now rock solid. If you do
so, take care that your root partition moves from hde to hda. Prepare a boot
disk and pass a parameter like root=/dev/hda to the kernel. After a
successful boot, modify fstab and lilo.conf and run lilo.

sounds absoluty identical to my problem with ASUS A7V133 I reported some
weeks ago.
