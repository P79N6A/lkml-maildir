Maybe this is better? 
CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO
  This option enables a new standardized data-transport driver. It replaces
  code currently in each chipset/host driver. This should help reduce
  bugs and allow better data protection. This new code also packetizes
  requests to enable rapid performance and reduce system latency. It also uses
  structures so MMIO hardware can be used in second generation Ultra133 and
  Serial ATA chipsets.
  Since this a a major reworking of current code, this will live along side
  current drivers for now. If this doesn't work on your arch yell. 
  If you want to test this new driver (and have backups), say Y here.
