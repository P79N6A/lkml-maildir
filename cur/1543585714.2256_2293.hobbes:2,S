Also for 2.5, kdev_t needs to go away, along with all those arrays based
on major number, and be replaced with either "struct char_device" or
"struct block_device" depending on the device.
I actually went through the kernel in 2.4.0-test days and did this. 
Most kdev_t usages should really be changed to "struct block_device". 
The only annoyance in the conversion was ROOT_DEV and similar things
that are tied into the boot process.  I didn't want to change that and
potentially break the boot protocol...
