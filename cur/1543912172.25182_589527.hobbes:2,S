Democracy is an ideal that is not attainable. A representative democracy 
is usually the best you can get. So you need people that have some 
competence to contribute to the endeavor. And AFAICT we approximate that 
reasonably. Many of the people that were not subject to the git commit 
quota are experienced hands that are valuable because of their experience 
with Linux and the Summit.
