The Python test harness is fairly artificial, but this is just the
best way I found to reliably reproduce the problem in a short amount
of time. It was just for convenience while running git-bisect. When
running the C program directly, there seems to be a somewhat random
chance that it will start up in the "bad" state. Once the single CPU
is stuck in this mostly-idle mode, it seems to stay that way for a
while.

The problem still occurs then, but killing/restarting the test app
seems to trigger the problem more reliably. As I said in the original
email about this, left to its own devices this problem will occur
seemingly-randomly. In the original VMware code I observed this
problem in, the same process would flip between the "good" and "bad"
states seemingly randomly, every few seconds.
