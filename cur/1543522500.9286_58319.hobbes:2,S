Er, not quite.
The Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582 (or shortly thereafter).
But some Protestant countries didn't want to obey the Pope's orders,
you know 8-)
Eg. England (and colonies) stayed on Julian calendar till 1752.
And so, 1700 was a leap year in England, but not in Italy, France or
Poland.
Yes, it _is_ fascinating.
