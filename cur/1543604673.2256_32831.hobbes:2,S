Well yes.  But this is what happens on alpha apparently.
On alpha, it seems that the wmb only has an effect on the cache of the
processor doing the writes, it doesn't affect any other caches.  The
wmb ensures that the invalidates from the two writes go out onto the
bus in the right order, but the wmb itself doesn't go on the bus.
Thus the invalidates can get processed in the reverse order by a
receiving cache.  I presume that an rmb() on alpha must wait for all
outstanding invalidates to be processed by the cache.  But I'm not an
expert on the alpha by any means.
Paul.
