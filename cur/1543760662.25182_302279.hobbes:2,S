Nothing at all. Where is _start: ?
Remove the 'main' label and substitute _start:
It is 'C' convention that programs start with main(). They
really don't. With the Linux API, they start at _start: and
do some housekeeping before calling main. That's what the
crt.o file that the 'C' tool-chain uses, does.
