If among 1000 thousand computers with 2.6.15, and 2.6.15-rcX reported
by klive.cpushare.com are 20 that are affected, you might say that
among 150.000 computers registered 
http://counter.li.org/
 there
are almost 3100 computers affected.
Yeah, a minority, but when you count them up it sums up to a hefty
number of admins or just users that hit a bug and do not know what
is going on.
Andrea Arcangeli's klive could some day be a measure of the bug-affected
fraction. If it already is not. Klive reports hardware setups
and configuration. I am not sure if it is available somehow but
maybe it would be nice to query klive database in an SQL manner?
