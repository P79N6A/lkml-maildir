The real question is who/what is responsible for this state management, X or a device
driver. I completely fail to see the advantage of having X do it. Oh, well.
Just as a random musing, I've got to wonder if RedHat's support of Precision Insight's
work reflects where they see the next market for Linux being (CAD?)... Maybe they'll be
funding GGI if/when they ever go after the consumer market!
