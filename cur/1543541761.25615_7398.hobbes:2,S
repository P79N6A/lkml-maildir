Tar can be updated; the format (AFAIK) already supports 
named streams/EAs, but the tools do not always. What's the point
in making apps written before streams existed work with streams
unmodified? It's like trying to make stereo sound work on a mono
radio -- the mono radio is not aware of two sound channels and
reproduces only a mono signal. Ditto with color TV -- it will
display on black and white TVs, but without color -- without the
extra data channels that create the color image.
Backwards-compatible does not have to mean "the same as."

Files with streams are not directories. I would not expect
readdir() to work on them. There would have to be a different
enumerator function.

Well, the filesystem could register "I support streams" and/or
"I support EAs" with the VFS (by providing function pointers
or something), _and_ provide its preferred namespace
augmentation, ":" for NTFS, for example. After all, ":" is
not a legal file or pathname character on NTFS.
I'm not sure that second part is cleaner than Linus'
straightforward "/dir/file/stream" idea, though. It 
looks like it might break the "consistency" we're
looking for, whereas Linus' idea will not.
On a side note, how many things will _break_ if ":"
is used? I.e., /dir/file:stream ?
