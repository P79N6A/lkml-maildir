- Do you still need the shortcut stuff with your own private buffer ?
I'd like to move to a model where ldiscs free up the tty buffers to both
improve the locking and kill the horrible DONT_FLIP hacks in n_tty. If
you do it isn't a problem but I need to ensure there is a way to
directly allocate a buffer for this use.
