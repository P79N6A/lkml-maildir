I was looking at driver for 8250 in 8250.c file and at the end
of "receive_chars" interrupt handler, it calls "tty_flip_buffer_push"
even if "tty->low_latency" is set since no such test is done before
the call...
I was also wondering why not always calling "schedule_delayed_work"
whatever the state of "tty->latency"?
