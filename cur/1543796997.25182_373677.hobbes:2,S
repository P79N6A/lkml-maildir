FWIW, I think it's not a serious argument.  Interface changes => grep time.
And that means grep over the tree anyway.

That's solved by asking for review...
As far as I'm concerned, the only thing here that looks like a possible
reason to move the entire thing is highly unusual semantics of final
close and interesting use of VFS interfaces in spu_create().  I.e. it's
not that we have a filesystem there.
OTOH, if you go looking for analogs as far as unusual interaction with VFS
is concerned...  net/unix is unlikely to get moved.
