maybe it should be approached from the other side; having a way to mark
connections as low priority (say incoming http connections to your
webserver) or as non-critical/expendable would give the "normal"
GFP_ATOMIC ones a better chance in case of overload/DDOS etc. It's not
going to solve the VM deadlock issue wrt iscsi/nfs; however it might be
useful in the "survive slashdot" sense...
