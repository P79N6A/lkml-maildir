Oh no, it was! commit 9d65cb4a1718a072898c7a57a3bc61b2dc4bcd4d
	Fix race between cat /proc/*/wchan and rmmod et al
	kallsyms_lookup() can go iterating over modules list unprotected which is OK
	for emergency situations (oops), but not OK for regular stuff like
	/proc/*/wchan.

I imagine user running powertop which IIRC trolls /proc/timer_list and
doing rmmod following powertop instructions.
