Well, the most obvious way to do it would be to run the calibration loop 
a large number of times, and observe the statistical variation.  In 
particular, one should see a bi- or multimodal pattern where the 
difference between the peaks amount to the "lost time".
When we have a clue about the loss of time then we can figure out how to 
detect it.
