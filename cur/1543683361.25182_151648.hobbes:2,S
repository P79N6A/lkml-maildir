I must wholeheartedly agree. I have not tried any of the interactivity 
work yet, but it is clear that your particular experience will depend on 
the specific test application used. For instance, using net-rhythmbox to 
play mp3s causes skips every time a web page is loaded, but it does not 
happen with xmms. Perhaps we should write down the various interactivity 
tests people have come up with, so that Con/Ingo/whoever else can test 
their work to some extent.
Thanks,
Rahul
