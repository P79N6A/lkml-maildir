The limits are communicated from the usb layer to the block layer via
the SCSI layer, by setting proper limits in the scsi host adapter
template. SCSI then informs the block layer, by setting the appropriate
limits on the queue. Perhaps there's a usb-storage bug there, who knows,
so far there's been no real info posted.

Someone may very well fix it, but the odds of that happening when a real
bug report exists is a lot bigger. Who reported this issue to you? Get
him/her to file a proper bug report, as I wrote in my last mail as well.
