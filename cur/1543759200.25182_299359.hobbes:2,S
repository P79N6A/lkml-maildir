But what's a "policy"?  And what's its scope?  When the device drivers
can cheaply turn their clocks on/off depending on whether their hardware
is in use, there's little point in having control knobs for that.  And
considering debug and testing, such knobs create pain and trouble.
Yet each different clock that can be gated creates a different family of
such low power "standby" states... all subtly different combinations
of active clocks.  I counted over six dozen clocks on one SOC; do the
math, it's hard to justify userspace caring about that many states!!
(Some characteristics may matter though, e.g. whether the 48 MHz PLL
is currently active or not.  If not, more aggressive power saving modes
might be available.)
There's a cost to having userspace make decisions.  When that cost can
exceed the power savings, it's probably best not to get it involved.
There are policy decisions that probably make sense in userspace,
like "backlight off"; and ones that certainly don't make sense there
(like IMO almost all clock gating decisions).

Actually it works the other way around:  hub status change events
are used to detect device removal, then the device gets told.
I think most hotpluggable busses work that way:  PCMCIA/CF, MMC,
CardBus, FireWire, PCI Hotplug, and so on.

Right, but there are important PM scenarios lurking there.  There's the
example of USB mice autosuspending, to enable root hubs to suspend,
allowing DMA to stop, and thus enabling C3 CPU mode, and saving 2 Watts
on top of the power no longer being supplied to that bus-powered mouse.
(And the same could be done for some other USB devices.)  This is,
you'll note, purely device power management ... it's all in the same
ACPI system state, S0.  (Though the mouse can probably be used to wake
the system from S1, S2, or S3 later on ...)
What we've discussed so far is that the only policy setting there
would be a module parameter for the HID driver, saying whether to
start that sequence after N seconds.  For the other drivers, CONFIG_PM
would seem to be enough of a request.

Using DBUS to allow active policy (re)decisions could work, but I'd
also like to see most PM policies not need to swap in DBUS.  Sysfs
is a fine place to record policy decisions (though the cost of each
new attribute is less memory available for Real Work).
Do you have examples of PM policies where a DBUS agent would need
to make choices on the fly?
