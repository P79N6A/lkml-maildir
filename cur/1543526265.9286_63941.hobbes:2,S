My latest LVM snapshot for 2.3.46 is here:
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/lvm/aa-20000119/LVM-2.3.46-aa-20000217.gz
It's based on a post 0.8 LVM tree.
My home is on top of LVM in stripe on two disks, thus I somehow have to
port LVM to each new 2.3.x kernel before I have a chance to run it ;).
These are the tools for my kernel implementation:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/lvm/aa-20000119/lvm-tools-aa-20000119.tar.gz
and this is the 2.2.x version in 2.2.14aa7 (works only if included into
2.2.14aa7 since depends on rawio).
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.14aa7/z-bigmem-rawio-lvm-2.2.14aa2-5.gz
The main feature is that in it I made snapshotting working and I use rawio
for doing the copy on write to have perfect semantics on both the
snapshotting logical volume and the snapshotted volume. There are also a
few fixes and little improvements. In the tools I now split the
user/kernel structures, so that you don't need to upgrade the tools after
a new kernel implementation came out unless there's a good reasons for
doing so. This in turn mean you can simply run `make` and it will build
all over the place without depending on includes outside the tarball.
I submitted all my LVM work to my friend Heinz Mauelshagen (author of
linux LVM) a few weeks ago and AFIK he is going to merge it in the
official LVM releases soon, then I hope it will be possible to merge LVM
into the 2.3.x kernel. BTW, with the new 2.3.46 ll_rw_block cleanups this
is the only change that I need to do in ll_rw_block to support lvm 8).
