Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.0: Change cryptic description and help for CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/29/182

The description and the help text for this option has bothered me long 
enough... I hope the new strings are more self-explanatory than the ones 
before.
