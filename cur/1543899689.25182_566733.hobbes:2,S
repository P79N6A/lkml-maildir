Yeah, but it seems like having a translations directory in the kernel
avoids that problem - anyone can update, it is a single source, no digging
for sites that aren't tied to the kernel, available in the distros
directly, etc.
I'm not sure that the web site hosting argument is a good one.  Arch
maintainers and Language Maintainers have some similarities.  Also, being
able to clearly mark which version of a document was last translated
would help a bit with the fact that most of us aren't proficient in all
of the world's languages.  But, knowing who the translation maintainer is,
and when the translation was last updated allows both the original doc
maintainer and the translation document maintainer to see when a document
likely needs to be updated.  And that is probably good enough.
