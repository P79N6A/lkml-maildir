My scheduling question is:
  Based on my (limited) experience with freebsd it seems that thier 
scheduling system allows priority to console applications.  This can be 
seen on one of the dual boot machines we have set up.  If the system is 
under heavy load, It appears as though the FreeBSD os will give the 
console interactive apps priority over, say, a compilation in the 
background.  The same situation results in "mouse-stutter" and long 
delays in a cursor response after a request is submitted.  The 4.4 BSD 
redbook confirms that the allow priority to interactive apps. (pg. 79).  Is 
there some way to implement this, or is it purely a tuning issue.
This could (possibly) be useful in thwarting a dos attack.  It would 
certainly makes administering a box more fun when its responsive(even 
under heavy load).
Thanks for your time,
Matt
