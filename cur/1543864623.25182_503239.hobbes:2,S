Well, I did it some time ago, although not very thoroughly.
AFAICS there are not so many, but one that stands out is the worker threads.
We needed two of them to actually go to sleep, so now it's possible to create
a "freezeable workqueue" the worker thread of which will not set PF_NOFREEZE,
but currently this is only used by XFS.
