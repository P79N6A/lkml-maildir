Are you sure?  A suspend takes about 5-10 seconds on my laptop.
(It was noticably faster with 2.3 kernels, btw.  Now it spends a second
or two apparently not noticing the APM event (though the BIOS is making
the speaker beep), then syncing the disk, then maybe another pause, then
maybe some more disk activity, then finally shutting down.  2.3 started
the disk activity immediately and didn't pause.  Perhaps 2.4.3 mm
problems?)
