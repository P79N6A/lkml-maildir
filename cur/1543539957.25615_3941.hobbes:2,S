FYI, both modern motherboards and modern disk-drives have their
BIOS 'flashed' with a JTAG port. The NVRAM chips are soldered onto
the boards and are installed blank. If the chip is bad, it would
have to be replaced, and therefore proves that you didn't break
it by flashing it. If it's good, it is readily flashed.
Other provisions, both front-door and back-door are often provided to
upgrade these BIOS. A bad BIOS on a motherboard, although often treated
as a major event by a vendor (where they tell you the board is trashed
and you need a new one), becomes a minor event when it is sent
to the distributor or manufacturer. They just flash a new BIOS with
a 'Raven' connected between a working PC's printer port and the JTAG port
on the board. In the case of a motherboard, it just has to be powered
up with the 'reset' clear. No existing BIOS need be functional.
