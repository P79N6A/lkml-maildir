Interesting oops.
Basically your "page->buffers" thing seems to be NULL.
Which is certainly interesting. And, thinking about it, quite legal. The
page can have been up-to-date a long time ago, and we ended up pruning the
buffers away in order to be able to free the page later - so when truncate
comes along and wants to look at the buffers they don't exist any more.
This is basically all due to the fact that the new truncate logic does a
"__block_commit_write()" without ever having itself called any of the
routines that establish the buffers (a regular write will always have
called "__block_prepare_write()" first, for example.)
We really should have done a true "block_truncate_write()", but it looked
so clever to just re-use the existing code. Fair enough. 
Still willing to test?
