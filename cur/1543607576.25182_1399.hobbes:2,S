Given that the spinlock would have to be spin_lock_irq (jiffies is
updated in clock interrupt code), is there a way to avoid the lock?  The
following code does it for UP systems, given it is not rearranged.  Is
there something like this that will work for 
SMP systems?
 (assumeing the defines below):
	do {
		jiffies_f = jiffies;
		jiffies_64_f = jiffies_64;
	}
	while ( jiffies_f != jiffies);
If all things are in order, this will work on UP.  Order could be
enforced by using locked instructions for the jiffies access...
