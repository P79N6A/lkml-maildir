OK, got a look at your patch.
You are using this internally, as part of the RCU -implementation-.
You are determining whether this CPU will still be needed by RCU,
or whether it can be turned off.  So how 'bout calling the (internal)
API something like rcu_needs_cpu()?
int rcu_needs_cpu(int cpu)
{
	struct rcu_data *rdp = &per_cpu(rcu_data, cpu);
	struct rcu_data *rdp_bh = &per_cpu(rcu_bh_data, cpu);
	return (!!rdp->curlist || !!rdp_bh->curlist || rcu_pending(cpu));
}
Then you can drop the rcu_pending() check from your 390 patch.
Seem reasonable?
The meaning of rcu_pending() is "Does RCU have some work pending on
this CPU, so that there is a need to invoke rcu_check_callbacks() on
this CPU?"
