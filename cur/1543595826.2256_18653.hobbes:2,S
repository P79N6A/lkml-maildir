Hi there,
i have a Dual-PCU-Board but only one CPU is plugged in.
I've compiled the kernel without SMP.
Now the system runs fine for about 1 Week. After than, it oftens "crashes".
"crashes" is not realy the thing ... diffrent things happen :
* The whole system hangs WIHTOUT any kernel-message on the screen or in the logfiles,
  i still can ping the system
* A lot of processes dieing, system is pingable, reboot with ctrl-alt-del works
* All processes are in state "Z", login is still possible
and so on ...
After the reboot, e2fsck needs to fix a lot of things (ext2 issue...).
The system is running on 2.4.4-ac18

The main use of the box is to serve webpages with apache+php, ftp and ssh, not too busy
(load is about 0.1<->1). Ide drives are absent.
Whats happending to this box? I've never had such problems. Is it because of the
Dual-Board and the non-smp kernel? (i need to know this, because we can't tolerate any more
downtime right now)
Thanks,
  Thomas
