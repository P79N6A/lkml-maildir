Manual page disappeared (no big problem, wasn't even complete). X Window tools 
are required to build it (gccmakedep). Uh.
Looks like parameters also have changed and are incompatible with previous 
irqbalance (--option vs option now).
Long standing typo:
        "eepro100",
        "orinico_cs",
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        "wvlan_cs",
