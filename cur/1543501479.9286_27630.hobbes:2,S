Along with various parport enhancements including an IEEE 1284/1284.3
framework (with most code already done), I have taken some code that Phil
Blundell started for console-on-parallel-port and finished it off.
It is available as a patch for 2.3.9 (which I've sent to Linus) and also
as a patch for 2.2.10 (which will disappear once someone makes lp-console
standalone for 2.2.x).

Note that printing works with this patch (obviously) and so does ppa, but
other parallel port drivers will need some fixing up.
Tim.
