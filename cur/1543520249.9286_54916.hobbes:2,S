I don't think this is necessary: If i am not experiencing a time warp, then
this is already known and fixed for ADSM on AIX. Last time some 2.1.1xx-ac
release triggered it IIRC. 
It is a buffer overflow in the ADSM server when a OS version longer than 8
chars is reported by the client to the server.
