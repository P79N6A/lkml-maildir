The write() prototype in tty_operations is:
	int  (*write)(struct tty_struct * tty,
		      const unsigned char *buf, int count);
Somehow the cast does eliminate the compiler warning (and give
a false sense of correctness).
However, ip2main.c::ip2_write() should be modified like so:
static int
ip2_write( PTTY tty, const unsigned char *pData, int count)
and drop the cast and fix the ip2_write comment (drop old arg 2),
and fix the ip2_write() prototype.
But then you (someone) will have to decide how to handle the
dropped <user> parameter when calling i2Output()...
I don't know the answer to that.
I just changed <user> to 0 to get a clean build of ip2main.o,
but ip2/i2lib.c still needs some work.
