Further datapoint: on a lark, I tried 8k stacks, and my symptoms changed - 
tst-mutex7 never failed, but running tst-mutex7a in a tight loop crashed 
the box reliably though differently.  I then recompiled with no debug 
options enabled, and ran all mutex tests in a loop for a couple of hours 
with no crash.
