systemtap and ltt are the only full-scale tracing tools which target
sysadmins and applciation developers of which I am aware..

My point is that I respect Karim and Frank's experience.  I in fact
disagree with them (or at least, I want to).  But they've been there, and I
haven't.  So I listen.

In the bit of text which you snipped I was agreeing with this...
Look, if Karim and Frank (who I assume is a systemtap developer) think that
we need static tracepoints then I have no reason to disagree with them. 
What I would propose is that:
a) Those tracepoints be integrated one at a time on well-understood
   grounds of necessity.  Tracepoints _should_ be added dynamically.  But
   if there are instances where that's not working and cannot be made to
   work then OK, in we go.
b) Saying "we need the static tracepoints because the line numbers keep
   on changing" is not, repeat not a justification for static tracepoints. 
   It's a SMOP to develop tracepoint-adding code which can handle line
   numbers changing.  lwall did it.
c) Any static tracepoints should be seen as corner-case augmentation of
   existing dynamic tracing framework(s).  IOW: I see no justification at
   this time for adding complete new second set of backend
   accumulation/reporting/management infrastructure (ie: LTT core).
Shorter version: I agree with Frank.
