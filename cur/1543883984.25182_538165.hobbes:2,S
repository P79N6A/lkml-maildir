Having the bugzilla ids in the subject it a bit annoying.  I understand
that cross-referencing bugs to patches is quite useful, but could
you use a special tag in the message body instead, similar to how
XFS use the SGI-PV: tag.  This also means you tell people which
bugzilla the bug actually was in.
