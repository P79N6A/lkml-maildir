Does that work when all of usb is a module?  The point of __initcall is
to avoid all the conditional code that used to be in main.c.

You have it backwards.  Rules.make does *not* sort, the link order is
implicit in the declaration order of objects in the Makefiles.  For
most makefiles, this kludge works, it does not work for USB.  See
