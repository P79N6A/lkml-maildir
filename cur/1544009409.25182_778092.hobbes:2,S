I would love to try, but this is my "production server" (i.e. I need it
for real work) and I'll be traveling the next few days. I will try to
bisect after that (if nobody else has any ideas) but will have to make
sure the bug is actually reproducible after the timeout - for now I only
observed it by accident (via mrtg).
In the meantime maybe someone else will observe it as well.
