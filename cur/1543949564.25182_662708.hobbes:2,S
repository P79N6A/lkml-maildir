Due to CS_CPU_EXCLUSIVE usage?
I had hoped system would be allowed to overlap.

The trouble is, cgroups are primarily about tasks, whereas IRQs are not.
So we would create a cgroup that does not manage tasks, but rather
associates irqs with sets of cpus - which are not cpusets.
See how that would be awkward?

But as long as nobody does CS_CPU_EXCLUSIVE they may overlap, right?
