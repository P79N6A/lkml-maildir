Returns a boolean.

But this returns a module*.
I'd suggest that __module_address() should do the same thing, from an API neatness
POV.  Although perhaps that's mot very useful if we didn't take a ref on the returned
object (but module_text_address() doesn't either).
Also, the name's a bit misleading - it sounds like it returns the address
of a module or something.  __module_any_address() would be better, perhaps?
Also, how come this doesn't need modlist_lock()?
