Hi Andi,
Thanks for the review.  I will try to answer your questions 
as inline.
The idea of declaring the bitmap with a field width was to
give an error if ID_BITS was made larger than the sizeof(int).
It would probably make more sense to set ID_BITS from
sizeof(int) or use an array for the bitmap and allow an
arbitrary value.

Coming up with good names is always hard.  Here is what they mean
what should they be called?
id_lookup - returns a pointer associated with an id value.
id_new - allocates a new id.  It returns the id and  
	saves the poiner in its data structure.
id_remove - frees the id and breaks the association between 
	the id and the pointer.
id_init - Initializes a "struct id" which is the basis for
	this id translation.

I will.  This does look wierd, is this my code?

I prototyped this code in user space and then started thinking
about locking.  How is what I'm doing different than pre-allocating
before locking.  I would still need to lock and re-check that I
had enough data structures pre-allocated and loop.

My assumption is that the id stuff would only be used from
code where I know interrupts are enabled. Saving the flags 
wouldn't hurt though.

When I wrote it I had hoped that it could be used for get_pid. See
my post:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102916884821920&w=2
I guess the argument is that this approach is memory efficient 
and scales well for all possible id -> kernel pointer mappings.

It better not its the resolution of the timer. Only a problem
if Hz is less than 1.

Good point.  It looks like  find_task_by_pid() needs to be protected
by a read_lock(&tasklist_lock).  The timers are linked into
a list so they will be removed when the process exits.  
Any sugestions on a code example that does this right are
welcome:-)

O.K. You caught me being lazy.  I have the same problem in the 
id code as well.
