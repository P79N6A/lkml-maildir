Further addendum:  Another shutdown this morning, and the only line in the 
log is the 3rd one here:

Thats a microsoft wireless mouse it keeps resetting, and I hadn't been in 
the room in 2+ hours.  My logs are littered with that message, but the 
mouse itself works fine.  I'd estimate that the mouse reset is over 90% of 
the content of my messages logs, and has been since back around 2.6.16 
days.  The batteries are fine.
I'm back to 2.6.18, but will build 2.6.19-rc2 shortly.
