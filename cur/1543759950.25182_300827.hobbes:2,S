The release of that source does not depend on software patents (which 
seem to be acked yesterday for europe ... ;-()
However with software patents a company could sue you for violating a 
patent wheter you wrote the code or reverse engeneered it. E.g. for a 
"transmitting information without cables, e.g. binary encoded via a 
radio signal modulated this and that way. claims: any implementation 
that transmit information without cables (including birds in the air) 
... and so on the usual patent fluff ..." patent.
