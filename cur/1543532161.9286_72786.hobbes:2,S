I stand enlightened. Thank you. It doesn't affect the argument above,
however, since the point was that the programmer doesn't control
the (max) stack available to him. So one needs to reserve swap backing
for the max stack size in a secure process.

Please don't tell me how it's done. I'd hate to know how to execute
a program in a malloced area! Come to that. I'd hate to know how to
exec code in a mallloced string. It must be assembler ..
