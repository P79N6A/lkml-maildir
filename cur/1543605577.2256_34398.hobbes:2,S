I have not investigated this very closely, but it seems to me that
/proc/sys/kernel/tainted does not work as intended. 
I use the nVidia binary-only drivers with my Geforce3 graphics card and
if I boot up in runlevel 3 (multi user, no X - on a Slackware 8 box) I
check that I have no modules loaded and at this point
/proc/sys/kernel/tainted is 0. Then I switch to runlevel 4 (multiuser,
with X) and the nVidia drivers load as X is started, I check
/proc/sys/kernel/tainted and find that it is still 0. Since the nVidia
drivers are binary only and not GPL shouldn't /proc/sys/kernel/tainted
be 1 (or at least != 0) ???
I'm currently running 2.4.13-pre6 + Robert Love's preempt patch.
