marcel,
most of the vendors, who claim IP just cite nonsense. There are really
hardly a few vendors who are really bound to the IP issue. Just that
they do not know how to write proper code, they do not want to open up
their code.
In fact , such vendors do have a think probably like this "if we open
up our driver if people see the pathetic quality, the customers would
probably think how bad is the hardware and probably affect our sales"
. So it would be better if we hide under the shade of the IP umbrella.
Little do that these vendors know that customers wouldn't want to go
alongwith such narrow minded vendors in the long run. But somehow due
to a certain void people do the get along, that's it, not for long
though.
regards,
manu
