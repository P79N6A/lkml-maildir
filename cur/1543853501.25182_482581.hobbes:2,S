Even easier and doesn't need any kernel features or special comments:
use git to track your patches, enable CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO and
uname will tell you exactly what kernel you're running:
  erik@kostunrix:~ > uname -r
  2.6.18-gf6057327
To see what's different, just use git:
  git log --no-merges v2.6.18..f6057327 | git-shortlog

        2.6.18-rc6 config for kostunrix
