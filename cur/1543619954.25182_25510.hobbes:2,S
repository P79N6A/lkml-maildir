You are right indeed. I tried a vanilla 2.4.17 kernel at it performs well with a kernel thread (even
better than a tasklet actually) :
TCP STREAM TEST to sci9
Recv   Send    Send                          
Socket Socket  Message  Elapsed              
Size   Size    Size     Time     Throughput  
bytes  bytes   bytes    secs.    MBytes/sec  
262144 262144 262144    10.00     157.73   
Any idea when this bug was fixed (haven't tried the latest RedHat errata kernel yet, but will do).
I guess now that I can use the kernel thread without loosing performance I can start using
generic_make_request() in the block device server.
Thanks for all the help,
Regards,
