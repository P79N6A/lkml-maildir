Hello,
I've a problem with raid.
When triing to build the old raidtools-0.50, it doesn't build because
some constants are unknown.
New raidtools-0.90 builds, but doesn't work without a special patch.
Is there a way to use raid 1 without this patch ?
With the patch, it works great, far more reliably than old raid on 
kernel 2.0
Is there a reason why this patch is not included inside the kernel 
tree ?
Thanks
Christophe
