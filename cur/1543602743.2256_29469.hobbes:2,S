It's just the closest I can get to my own name in hex. ;)

It's possible... I got mine from kernel.org, applied the preemptible-kernel
and ext3fs patches, and  compiled with RH's "kgcc"

Did you have apm=on set before, or nothing at all?  Here's what I've seen so
far:
In all cases, I've got apm compiled into the kernel, not a module.
- With 2.4.10, Before your patch, with no apm= option in the kernel command
line, APM in general works, but suspend doesn't.  When I append apm=on or
apm=off to my kernel command line, APM is disabled.
- With 2.4.10, After applying your patch, apm=on no longer disables APM, but
suspend still doesn't work.

Just for fun, I tried removing all of my loaded 2.4.10 modules one by one,
and attempting 'apm --suspend' in between, and still had the same problem
when I got down to the bare minimum (ext3 and jbd)

I just checked, and the RH-compiled 2.4.9-0.5 doesn't suspend either.  It
appears to suffer from the same "apm=on" command-line bug too.  I'm gonna go
try the 2.4.7 from RH's "Roswell" beta now.
