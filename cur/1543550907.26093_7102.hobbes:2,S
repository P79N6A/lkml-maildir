Forgot to mention, this is linux 2.4.0-test9 with rik's latest vm patch. I
compiled scsi emu support and scsi cdrom support into the kernel and made
ide-cdrom support as module and it's not loaded.  I get this in dmesg:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  Vendor: IDE-CD    Model: R/RW 4x4x24       Rev: C12a
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 32x/32x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.11
When i set cdrecord to sr0, i get read-only device. and device not
recognized errors.  Here is the output to cdrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -inq 
Cdrecord 1.9 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2000 Jörg Schilling
scsidev: '/dev/sr0'
devname: '/dev/sr0'
scsibus: -2 target: -2 lun: -2
cdrecord: Read-only file system. Cannot open '/dev/sr0'. Cannot open SCSI
driver
As far as I know, you cant have id's below 0, what's wrong here? is this a
cdrecord problem due to a change in kernel scsi or is this a kernel scsi
bug?
