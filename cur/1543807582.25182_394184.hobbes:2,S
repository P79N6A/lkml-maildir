This is exactly the reason why we allow host system to see all the 
containers/VPSs/processes.
Otherwise monitoring tools should be fixed for it, which doesn't look 
good and top/ps/kill are not the only tools in the world.
Without such functionality you can't understand whether you machine is 
underloaded or overloaded.
