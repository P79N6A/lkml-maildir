Applying and compiling your patch I see:
  CC      drivers/acpi/executer/exregion.o
drivers/acpi/executer/exregion.c: In function 'acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler':
drivers/acpi/executer/exregion.c:81: warning: 'window_size' may be used uninitialized in this function
After glancing through this file it seems that ioremap_cache is always 0
and acpi_os_unmap_memory will unconditionally be executed at end of this function.
I am not familiar with that code. But I just want to reinsure that this
is what you want. And if so, why is that variable needed?
But maybe I missed something ...
(I'll test it tomorrow, or I better should say later today.)
