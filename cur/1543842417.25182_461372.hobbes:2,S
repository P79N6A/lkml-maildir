The situation is rare if you just have a couple of cpus and it also does 
not occur if you do not pin processors.

Then the load will likely be sitting on a runqueue and run 
much slower since it has to share cpus although many cpus are available 
to take new jobs. The scanning is very fast and it is certainly better 
than continuing to overload a single processor.

Lets say you store the latest set of pinned cpus encountered (I am not 
sure what cpu number would accomplish). The next time you have to 
reschedule the situation may be completely different and you would have
to revalidate the per cpu pinned cpu set.

Could you tell us how this could work?

Can we merge this patch and then I will try to move this as fast as 
possible to userspace?
Ok then we need to do the following to address the current issue and to
open up the possibilities for future enhancements:
1. Add a new field to /proc/<pid>/cpu that can be written to and that
   forces the process to be moved to the corresponding cpu.
2. Extend statistics in /proc/<pid>/ to allow the export of more scheduler
   information and a special flag that is set if a process cannot be 
   rescheduling. initially the user space scheduler may just poll this 
  field.
3. Optional: Some sort of notification mechanism that a user space 
   scheduler helper could subscribe to. If a pinned tasks situation
   is encountered then the notification passes the number of the
   idle cpu.
