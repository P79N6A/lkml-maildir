NP, this is just for fun and maybe for doing something useful for

It helps if you are going to trust a whole group of users.
The procfs entry goes inside proc to make it clearly accessible for the
immediate users, and /proc, in my opinion, is the legacy interface for
such type of things (even the input can not be handled as a sysctl as
grsec's tpe does, because we handle complete acl's and not just one
trusted group nor user).
Anyway, if i must do it i will do it, it's not a problem (i think so).

About the point 1), yesterday i wrote just a simple regression test
(that can be found at the same place as the patch) and of course it
bypasses, this is an old commented problem, Stephen suggested the use of
the mmap and mprotect hooks, so, i will have a look at them but i'm not
sure on how to (really) prevent the dirty,old trick.
About 2), just give it a chance, maybe it's useful and my work is not
completely nonsense.

OK, i will try to work on them but i can't promise, this is my second
month playing around with kernel hacking (and almost C programming), so,
i'll need one or two nights to see how to get it ;-)
Thanks for the comments and your attention,
Cheers.
