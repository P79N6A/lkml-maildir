When I say linux, I don't mean linux servers; just the basic kernel with
its networking features. I am toying with this idea because a DSP chip is
considerably cheaper than the present day pentium.
I was always under the impression that Pentium processors, or even 486's 
were less expensive than DSP's... am I wrong?
