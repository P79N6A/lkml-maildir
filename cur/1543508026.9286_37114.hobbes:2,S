Hi,
    Ted, I think I've found an bug in the new serial driver: the following
line in kernels <= 2.3.16pre1 was enough to have a serial console setup:
append="console=ttyS1,38400 console=tty0 video=matrox:vesa:440"
but with 2.3.16 it no longer works, with the serial console working only
up to the serial.c version banner, then nothing more goes to the serial
console.
If a change the append line in lilo.conf to this:
append="console=ttyS1,38400 video=matrox:vesa:440"
The console serial goes back to full life, but I don't get the kernel
messages going too to tty0, as I want.
looking at the diffs I think the only serial console relevant part is
this hunk:
-static int tioccons(struct tty_struct *tty, struct tty_struct *real_tty)
+static int tioccons(struct inode *inode,
+       struct tty_struct *tty, struct tty_struct *real_tty)
 {
-       if (tty->driver.type == TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_CONSOLE ||
-           tty->driver.type == TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_SYSCONS) {
+       if (inode->i_rdev == SYSCONS_DEV ||
+           inode->i_rdev == CONSOLE_DEV) {
                if (!suser())
                        return -EPERM;
                redirect = NULL;
   Hope this is helpful,
         - Arnaldo
