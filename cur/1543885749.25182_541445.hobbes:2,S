Something is not right here.... was this the patch that I submitted?  If 
so then I definitely screwed up pretty badly.
I thought I had done (sorry for the cut-and-paste):
 
+#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
+#define __CPUINIT	.section	".text","ax"
+#define __CPUINITDATA	.section	".data","aw"
+#else
+#define __CPUINIT	__INIT
+#define __CPUINITDATA	__INITDATA
+#endif
Maybe some wires got crossed along the submit route...  Russell, I'll 
submit a fix against the latest tree.
