Attn: Sales Manager
If you are outsourcing or need to expand your sales force for the short term or long term contract, Telexpand will create a tailored campaign to 
guarantee you and your product success.
We are an established, full service call center with a completely trained staff of 70 plus salespeople with a proven track record to close sales for 
your product or service.
We currently market over $1 million dollars per month in closed sales for one of the largest companies in the Washington D.C. area,  scheduling 
approximately 300 appointments per week...again, these are closed sales! 
We service all industries who would consider an inbound or outbound campaign of any size.
Let's talk...
