This part worries me a lot.  I would alsmost rather all possible
messages get stuck somewhere common so driver writes can't add these
ad-hoc and we can avoid a proliferation of either similar or pointless
messages.
Forcing these into a common place lets people eyeball if a new
messages really is necessary --- and it makes writing applications to
deal with these things easier (since you don't have to scan the entire
kernel tree).
