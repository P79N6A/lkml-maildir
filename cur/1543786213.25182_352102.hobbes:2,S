Ahh, ok... VM_MAYSHARE is the recorded MAP_SHARED, while VM_SHARED says 
whether the pages are actually shared and writable.

Where? Not in the page fault path.... it's as penalized as the rest of the 
system. Or will direct reclaim have a preference for pages of the calling 
process?

Those pages would be either needed (and wouldn't be swapped anyway) or 
unneeded (and thus they'd waste memory).
But the waste is possible even currently. If not having rmap were a local DoS, 
well, an unprivileged user may well mmap and remap nonlinearly some really 
big files.
So, it would really be better to actually enforce the RSS rlimit when mapping 
in pages in *nonlinear* areas (and fallback on setting file PTE's like on 
NONBLOCK & page not in cache), rather than the "current" Rik's idea of 
marking pages as inactive on memory-hog processes.
But oh, right in mm/trash.c, the code which should do part of this is fully 
commented out - and it was in the very first version of the code (looking 
through bkcvs-git repository).
And the RLIMIT_RSS is totally unused - I bet Rik's patch didn't manage to go 
in, or it's me missing something?
