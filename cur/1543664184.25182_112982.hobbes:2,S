I'm having trouble with STRIP in 2.4.20.  While I can configure
and use it (sometimes), I cannot shutdown operation by killing
the slattach process.  The kernel reports that there are still
open references to the device, even after "ifconfig...down" is
performed.
Are there folks out there using this feature with whom I might
discuss this further?
