Yeah, that sounds like trouble.  I expect this may become a problem even for 
PC architectures in the future (IOMMUs on multiple busses for example), so 
maybe it makes sense to change the core to not assume 0 == unassigned?

But we should never hit the l == 0xffffffff case if it's a memory BAR, since 
the low bit will be 0, right?
I think Grant is probably right that the only time we'd hit this is if the bus 
is down and we're getting back all 1s for every read (though that's a PC 
specific assumption).

Yeah, it seems like it could be safely removed, but this is an area where we 
should probably move slowly (i.e. one, very small change to the probing code 
at a time) or it may be difficult to isolate any bugs in the wild.
