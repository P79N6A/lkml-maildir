True, and I just couldn't agree more with Lee that lots of the delays 
that one looks at is because of user space. Still, I have some doubt on 
how faster 2.6 is sometimes, where 2.4 is faster in other things.
i.e. As my newbie view, I can see 2.6 running faster in X, Compiling and 
stuff, but I see 2.4 working much faster when running commands, response 
and interaction in the console. But then again, this could be only me...
