Definitely.  VGER is running fairly liberal mode, while some
other systems I run in extremely strict mode.   As a result,
vger lets in spams, which could be blocked by running strict.

Nope, the protocol line parser in original version was simple,
it reused same code for "MAIL FROM:" and "RCPT TO:" as for
"From:" and "To:", therefore with old sendmails you could
do in SMTP:
   MAIL FROM: < foo@bar >
   MAIL FROM:   foo@bar
and I think even:
   MAIL FROM: Example User foo@bar
There really was no SMTP protocol parser, there was just something
resembling it on surface.   (And tons of security problems...)
