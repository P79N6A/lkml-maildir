The "thrashing" has been going on for roughly 10 hours now.  Is there a
point at which I can expect it to stop?  The load average is at 441 (down 
from > 700 last night), and the stress program was killed at 1:00AM CST
last night.  This (obviously) isn't an important machine so if you want me
to ride it out I will.
