Thanks Ingo!
I'll fetch up the tree you mentoined in prev letter and next time
try to be more carefull with patches I'm sending (i'm a bit busy
with my second machine on which i'm trying to install fc8 but
anaconda hangs again and again so that is the reason I'm not sync'ed
with x86 and mm trees yet, sorry)
