	... changes all occurrences of 'flavour' to 'flavor' 
	Andries, I did a small check if mount uses the fieldnames from
	the kernel headers, which doesn't seem to be the case, can you
	confirm this?
[was this an email mixup?]
Am not sure what you are asking, but if you mean things like
MS_RDONLY, no, these come from a private include file.
As you know user space utilities cannot easily use kernel includes.
