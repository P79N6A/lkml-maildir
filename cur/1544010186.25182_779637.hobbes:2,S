Hmm, I'm not sure I understand why struct kmem_cache_cpu ->freelist is 
never scanned. For SMP, I suppose kmemleak doesn't scan the per-CPU 
areas? But for UP, struct kmem_cache is allocated with kmalloc() and 
that contains struct kmem_cache_cpu as well.
And I suppose we never scan struct pages either. Otherwise ->freelist 
there would be a problem as well.
