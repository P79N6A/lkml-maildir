I assume (and hope) the reason is always the BKL.
I would rather not eliminate any explicit reschedules from the kernel
for the preemptive kernel case only.  That sort of defeats a purpose
(response improvement) of the kernel.
And I wholeheartedly agree that the situations where the BKL is held
should be handled and an ideal solution is to just not explicitly
schedule anywhere in the kernel with a preemptive kernel.  But I suspect
this will involve a lot of dark magic wrt BKL locking semantics.
What do you have in mind?
