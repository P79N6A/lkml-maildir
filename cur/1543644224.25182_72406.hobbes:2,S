as i've mentioned in the previous mail, 2.5.35+ kernels have a very fast
SIGSTOP/SIGCONT implementation, which change was done as part of this
project - a few orders faster than throwing/catching SIGUSR1 to every
single thread for example.
so right now we first need to get some results back about how big the GC
problem is with the new SIGSTOP/SIGCONT implementation. If it's still not
fast enough then we still have a number of options.
