(Replying to myself with an updated version of the patch, apply this one
instead.)
I was wondering how the ID got lost.  I noticed that the file was pretty
much rewriten (the -rc patch is just a huge number of removes, followed
by an equally large number of adds).  So I started looking at the two
files side by side, wondering if any other IDs were missed.  Then I
think I spotted what happened.  In the -rc patch, there is an ID pair
for, "PCI_VENDOR_ID_LSI_LOGIC, PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMI_MEGARAID".  Since LSI
just starting making MegaRAID cards, there would have never been a
device produced with that ID.  The line I added in my patch was for the
MEGARAID3.  Looking at the older version of the file showed just as I
guessed, there wasn't an LSI_LOGIC MEGARAID.  I'm thinking the '3' got
dropped in the conversion between the old and new files.
So, attached is a second version of this patch.  Instead of adding a
totally new PCI ID, I'm just removing the incorrect LSI MEGARAID, and
replacing it with the LSI MEGARAID3.  I've also diffed against 2.6.1-rc3
this time (but megaraid.c wasn't touched between -rc2 and 3).
