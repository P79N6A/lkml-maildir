Unfortunately last time I commented on this the response was roughly
"well, the patch already made it into Linus' kernel, it's too late to
fix it now."  That isn't exactly a very helpful response.
The mem= parameter has the semantic in the i386/PC boot protocol that
it specifies the top address of the usable memory region that begins
at 0x100000.  It's a bit of a wart that the boot loaders have to be
aware of this, but it's so and it's been so for a very long time.
