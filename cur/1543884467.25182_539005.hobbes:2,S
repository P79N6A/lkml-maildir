99% of the fds you'll find inside an event loop you care to scale about, 
are *already* fd based.   The handful of the remaining ones (signals, 
timers, AIO signaling, ??) will likely account for a *very limited* number 
of fds.   On top of that, those fds are very cheap in terms of memory 
(they're basically wakeup targets), since the new code shares the inode 
for them.   So we have a limited number of fds, using a pretty limited 
amount of memory each.
And this approach is not bound to a completely new and monolitic interface.
All these things need to basically deliver notifications of completion, 
and being able to read results.   Things that the existing f_op->poll and 
f_op->read are already able to give us.   Is that really a strange concept 
to base it on?   Because, to me, it seems pretty natural.
