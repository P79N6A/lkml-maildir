Nope, Thunderbird simply got fooled by the added header line:
 Content-Disposition: inline; filename=cpuset-system.patch
These patches were sent by quilt...
  User-Agent: quilt/0.45-1
and as such are the proper way to send patch series.
I pulled this up in Thunderbird, hit reply and it kept the patch. Perhaps
your options are not set up correctly, or you need to upgrade your
Thunderbird.
