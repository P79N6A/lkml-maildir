I seem to mix things up too often. Smaller and correct:
-o rw for ro-exported-fs returns EACCES instead of EROFS for write 
operations on files that exist.

I use nfsv3...

What, the client does not pass the ro/rw flag along? Humm.
But knfsd knows that a certain export is ro, and therefore should return EROFS
for all write operations that it receives.
