OK, we died in release_thread:
266                     if (dead_task->mm->context.size) {
the `mm' has been returned to slab.
Something is wrong with the task_struct refcounting, there is
no doubt about that.  Several people have reported instances where
the slab use-after-free detector has detected task_struct.usage
being decremented against a freed task_struct.   Probably this
is the same bug, detected by other means.
It has been seen on uniprocessor too.  We don't know what is causing it.
