Let me take Alan's example one step further:
o	CPU 0 starts executing xxx_read_lock(), but is interrupted
	(or whatever) just before the atomic_inc().
o	CPU 1 executes synchronize_xxx() to completion, which it
	can because CPU 0 has not yet incremented the counter.
o	CPU 0 returns from interrupt and completes xxx_read_lock(),
	but has incremented the wrong counter.
o	CPU 0 continues into its critical section, picking up a
	pointer to an xxx-protected data structure (or, in Jens's
	case starting an xxx-protected I/O).
o	CPU 1 executes another synchronize_xxx().  This completes
	immediately because CPU 1 has the wrong counter incremented.
o	CPU 1 continues, either freeing a data structure while
	CPU 0 is still referencing it, or, in Jens's case, completing
	an I/O barrier while there is still outstanding I/O.
I agree with Alan -- unless I am missing something, we need a
synchronize_sched() in synchronize_xxx().  One thing missing in
the I/O-barrier case might be the possible restrictions I call
out in my earlier email.
