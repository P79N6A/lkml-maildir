Sorry I didn't have the chance to try this test before: I didn't try it on
2.6.8.1-mm1 as I saw that maybe the patch related to the array sawitching was
dropped.
Anyway, I tried the test on 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 and it fails the test with 2 and 20
threads (delays of about 3 seconds for 2 threads, and 5 seconds with 20).
