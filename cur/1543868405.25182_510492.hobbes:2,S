MTD interface is not flawed, why? It is a good abstraction for flash
chips. 
UBI provide too many new services to utilize MTD interface. UBI != MTD,
but UBI may behave like MTD, although it is wider.

I do not think so, but the idea sounds exciting, please, talk to dwmw2
about this. But surely you know how different flash devices and HDD's
are: 
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/general.html
MTD devices are bare flashes.
Block devices are HDDs, MMCs, SDs, USB sticks, etc.

Why not? UBI is something which works on top of MTD, so it does relate
to MTD. But yes, it has nothing to do with block devices, I do not why
you talk about them. They are just irrelevant in my opinion, lets remove
them from discussion.

All the the conversion things were created as debugging tools. I have
not heard anybody used them in production. But may be someone do, but
this is rare though and they must have _really good reasons_ for this.

I do not see any point in this. SD card is a block device. It was
designed to be a block device. Using it for different purpose does not
look reasonable. Use bare flashes instead.
But technically it is possible to add block device back-end support to
UBI, but I do not know any real use-case for this.

A debugging tool to develop flash software on host. Not normally used
for other purposes.

Close to MTD but also have a lot of new services.

MTD devices emulated by UBI.

Stupid FTL driver, to emulated block devices on top of MTD. Too
straightforward, may only be used in RO mode. Any use in RW mode is
dangerous as you loose whole eraseblock in case of an unclean reboot.

Is MTD here?
