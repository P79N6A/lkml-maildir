I just given my explaination of why pre6 is completly unbalanced (even if
I have never run pre6 myself, but I just tried doing what pre6 does some
time before pre6 was out). I quote myself:
	I think there are problems with 2.2.0-pre6 VM (even if I have not tried it
	yet really). Latest time I tried on previous kernel to use in
	__get_free_pages() a try_to_free_pages weight > than MAX_SWAP_CLUSTER (aka
	freepages.high - nr_free_pages) I had bad impact of VM balance under
	swapping. 
	The problem is try_to_free_pages() implementation. Using a lower weight as
	in pre5 we was sure to return to shrink_mmap with more frequency and so
	getting more balance. Instead now we return to risk to only swapout
	without make real free memory space.
Your patch will not fix the problem. The problem is try_to_free_pages()
implementation.
