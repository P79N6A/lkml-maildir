I don't, in this case. I have proposed a scheme to reclaim
swap space and disk space is cheap was one of Linus' arguments
for rejecting the extra complexity of swap space reclaiming(IIRC).
That said, reclaiming swap space isn't very high on my priority
list since most people do have enough memory/swap anyway and
there are a few VM things to sort out that affect everybody, and
not just those unfortunate people who are short on memory and
swap.
Once I get some more time, however, I will make a patch to
reclaim swap space ... at least for non-shared pages.

This isn't a very big concern for me, though I must admit
that's mostly because I've never seen a production machine
use more than half of its swap space.  ;)
