This is not the adm9240 driver writing this, but the smbus driver for
the SMBus chip your ADM9240 chip is connected to. Which driver is it for
you? lsmod should tell (if not, modprobe i2c-dev && i2cdetect -l
should.)
I suspect that you simply have CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_BUS enabled. Please
check your .config.
