Ah - good catch - thanks, Andrew.  I should put together a fix,
to check these kmalloc calls.
For rebuild_sched_domains(), this can mean we just up and return having
done nothing.
For arch_init_sched_domains(), the code calling arch_init_sched_domains()
is not checking for failure, and doesn't have a trivial fallback code
path in the case of failure.  I'll have to think about that one just a
little.
Thanks, Andrew!
