Not quite.  It's more of a "some overlap," so that as soon as 2.6.x
comes out we don't instantly drop 2.6.(x-1).y stream.  But we don't keep
it going, typically more 1 or 2 2.6.(x-1).y releases once 2.6.x is out.

I had actually queued them up, but we only had 1 or 2 other patches,
and they weren't significant enough to warrant flushing that queue.
