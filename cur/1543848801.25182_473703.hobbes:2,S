Hi,
I'm not sure if this is the right place for questions like these, but I will 
give a try.
I build a cluster for Technological Institute of Athens, here, in Greece, with 
linux of course. My hardware is sixteen HP DL380 with 3.00GHz Xeon(do not 
laugh, I know that my cluster is too small for those, some of you, design and 
maintain). I want to install the pure vanilla-sources but I have problem to 
decide the best version. 2.6.18.1 is out but I think that it' s not a good 
idea to install the latest kernel, so, I would like to tell me your 
opinion(eg, I think debian is using 2.6.8(too old!)).
What would you do?	
I appreciate your help,
with regards,
Panos
