Hi!
Still, the 7411 is just an extension of the 7409 in that it adds some
extra meaning to some register bits. This is still similar enough to say
the vt82c586b to be in the same driver IMHO. The only differences are in
UDMA mode and UDMA mode is different even between different VIA chips.
I don't know about the 7403 (amd-745?) chip. Do you have any docs for
it? Can you send them to me? I'd bet the 7403 is very very much like the
amd-645 chip.
