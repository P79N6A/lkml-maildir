Old IDE is wrong on this and in fact unless it has changed recently
simply can't cope with and doesn't provide functions for it. A libata
driver can use the libata helpers but those also rely on the core ata
code doing certain things so if you cut and paste it over you might have
to make other old IDE changes in parallel.
