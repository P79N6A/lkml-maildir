I think it's just '\n'; other characters that you've mentioned achieve
(1) by exploiting (2).

...except that there are control chars above 0x20:

(scroll down to the end).  One thing that I did not mention in that older
posting is that, IIRC, according to my vt420 manual, macro recording and
playback may be invoked via the 8-bit controls (in some terminal modes).
This is not limited to real (hardware) terminals; of the 8-bit controls,
at least CSI (0x9b) is typically supported by terminal emulators.  Even
our linux/drivers/char/console.c supports it.
Although most terminal emulators don't appear to allow for macro
recording/playback to be requested with control chars, they do support
status requests - to which they respond with certain easy-to-guess
strings (an attack would be to create a script in PATH under that name -
yes, this has multiple prerequisites).
So I think that we should escape chars in the 0x7f to 0x9f range as well.

I'd agree, but what about dmesg?  It reads directly from the kernel and
it is commonly run with output to a tty.  OK, maybe dmesg (the userspace
program) should be fixed.

Yes.
In fact, if you do the escaping right when substituting values for "%s",
then you'll cover (3) as well.
You probably don't want to modify the behavior of vsnprintf() for all of
the kernel; you only want to affect its behavior when called from
printk().  So you might need to be calling a private function instead,
which would accept an additional argument, and make vsnprintf() a
wrapper around that function.  Yes, that would be a hack.
Alternatively, you can do the escaping right after the vsnprintf() call,
but then it will affect more than just "%s".  I am not sure whether this
is acceptable.

I agree.
