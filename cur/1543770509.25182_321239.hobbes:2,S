Using daemon() is generally wise - it is basically a double fork and
then one exits so that the orphan child becomes owned by init. However
it also knows about platform specific considerations like setpgrp v
setsid, whether an ioctl must be done to disown the controlling tty etc
which can be fairly OS generation specific.
