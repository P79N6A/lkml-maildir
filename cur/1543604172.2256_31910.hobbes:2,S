Hello folks,
I was wondering if someone is aware of the existence of a patch for
2.2/2.4 which allow the tuning at runtime of the following values:
timeout_close
timeout_closewait
timeout_established
timeout_finwait
timeout_icmp
timeout_lastack
timeout_listen
timeout_synack
timeout_synrecv
timeout_synsent
timeout_timewait
timeout_udp
You know LVS only affects the tuning of those timers for its virtual
servers, and BTW the patch I'm looking for is not related to LVS.
Anyone?
Regards,
	ph.
