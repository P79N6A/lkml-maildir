Yes, any powersavings without cost are a good idea.

What is D/HIPS? I could not find anything relevant..

For now, powering down controller when disks are spinned down would be
very nice first step.
When I forced disk to be spinned down (with power/state file)
controller actually survived power down/power up... unfortunately with
so long delay (~30 sec) that it is not usable in practice.

Would be nice :-).
