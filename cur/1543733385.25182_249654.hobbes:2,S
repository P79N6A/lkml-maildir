Yes this is a problem with the balancing code in SMP. It will continually 
keep trying to balance the now unbalanced cpus (2 tasks on one cpu and the 
other cpu idle) despite the fact that the affinity is set for those 2 tasks 
to run on the other cpu. The balancing code is not smart enough (yet?) to 
recognise that there is no point trying to balance processes that you don't 
want balanced.
