Since they have to co-operate some way on the resources _anyway_, they'll 
just need to work it out amongst themselves.
One common case is to have a "arbitration driver" that tends to do the
actual low-level accesses and is one level of abstraction over the
hardware (papers over trivial differences in hardware). An example of this
would be the old-style ISA DMA infrastructure (now happily pretty much
dead), where the "DMA driver" was just a trivial layer that had some basic
allocation/deallocation and had somewhat nicer access routines than the
raw IO accesses, but didn't do much more.
Another case is the PS/2 keyboard driver, where the mouse and the keyboard
actually share the controller, and they shared a spinlock and some helper
routines to guarantee some basic serialization (that eventually got 
replaced with the current i8042 driver, but the old setup was trivial).

I'd suggest the minidriver case. You _will_ find common issues anyway
(locking and certain access patterns etc), and the minidriver ends up
being a place to put the trivial shared code too.
