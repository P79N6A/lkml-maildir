That looks like a problem.  If uart_open is just calling schedule() and if
the current process running in uart_open is being selected again, the system
is hung.

The code:
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main (void)
{
int fd = open ("/dev/ttyS1");
printf("Opened\n");
}

Are you sure that CLOCAL is not set on /dev/ttyS0? and that the cat is not
sleeping on a read???  That's my original question: how can uart_open be
changed to put the process to sleep rather than looping like it does now.
