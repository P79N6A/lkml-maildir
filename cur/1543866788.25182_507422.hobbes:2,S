I've seen this as well, on an ancient 4MB card. I'm pretty sure the
-CSEL signal on my test board is incorrectly routed, so I thought it
was because of that. I'll try to strap it tomorrow and see if it
really is the cause of the problem.

In my current pile of four CF cards, it looks like three of them are
buggy, although in slightly different ways. I'd be happy to test a few
patches.
