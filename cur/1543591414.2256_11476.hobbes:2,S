	One can justify any behavior, since this is a datagram socket but the
kernel does know that it has been 'disconnected'. One can even justify the
inconcsistent behavior -- the write definitely has no place to go (now), but
the read can't be totally sure that there is no possible way anybody could
ever find the other end and write to it.	I think it would, however, be
preferable to have it return ECONNRESET in all cases (read, write, and
'select'/'poll' should hit on read and write).
