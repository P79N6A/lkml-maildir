You could do both. Have the x86 directory that Linus suggests for shared
files, then have the build system generate the symlinks for you.
Could have arch/x86_64/kernel/common arch/x86_64/mm/common etc. symlinks.
that point to arch/x86/kernel, arch/x86/mm etc.
This way you know exactly which files are shared and which are not, which
is basically impossible without a grep currently. You also get to do a
single grep of all arch code. Best of both worlds? Or do I miss something?
