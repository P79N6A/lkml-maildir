Subject: 2.2.0pre9: Solid crash when out of mem+swap?!

Today, I accidentally ask gimp to open a 160MB file on a machine
with 64MB RAM + 128MB swap. When mem+swap ran full, the X system froze.
Switching consoles was still possible and one said
INIT: PANIC: segmentation violation! giving up..
On a text console, no reboot did work. Neither did Crtl-Alt-Del.
Finally I had to use the reset button ;-(
I'm not into kernel hacking, but was thinking Linux would handle this
situation more gracefully.
Hope, this is not a bug in the new 2.2.0 series ;-)
