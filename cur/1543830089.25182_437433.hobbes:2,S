Subject: [Suspend2][ 04/35] [Suspend2] Does a filewriter page have contiguous blocks?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/508

To simplify things, pages in the file being used by the filewriter which
don't have contiguous blocks are ignored. This function determines whether
a given page meets this criteria by bmapping each sector in the page to
check.
