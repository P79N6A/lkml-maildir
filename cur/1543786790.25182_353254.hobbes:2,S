  As I've said in the other reply, I'll first rip off three stage init 
thing for cpucontrol.  That added pretty much complexity to it.  And 
with the weird naming scheme, please tell me how to fix it.  I have no 
problem renaming things.

  Using array of rwsems means that every reader-side ops performs 
(unnecessary) real down and up operations on the semaphore which involve 
atomic memory op and probably memory barrier.  These are pretty 
expensive operations.
  What brsem tries to do is implementing rwsem semantics while 
performing only normal (as opposed to atomic/barrier) intstructions 
during reader-side operations.  That's why all the call_on_all_cpus 
stuff is needed while write-locking.  Do you think avoiding 
atomic/barrier stuff would be an overkill?

  I agree that brsem write-locking would be too heavy for mmap_sep for 
usual cases.
  Thanks.
