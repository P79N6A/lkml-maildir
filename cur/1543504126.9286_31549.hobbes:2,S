No, he means that nobody uses them. Ok, I haven't checked every program
but I bet that no program that uses threads currently or in the future
will use fs and gs on x86.
Using fs for some thread-specific pointer improves threaded perl speed
by over 9% consistently. (However, the next thread model of perl will
no longer rely on fast thread-specific data, which is an even better
solution).
