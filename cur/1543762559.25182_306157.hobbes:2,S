Are you serious?  So Documentation/sound/alsa/* isn't maintained by the
ALSA maintainers?
Wow, this would explain why all Linux documentation is at least 2 years
out of date.

At least from my experience, ksymoops is useless on x86 for 2.6 kernels.
Here is a patch to finally bring oops-tracing.txt into the 2.6 era.  :-P

 If you are totally stumped as to whom to send the report, send it to 
 linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org. Thanks for your help in making Linux as
 stable as humanly possible.
