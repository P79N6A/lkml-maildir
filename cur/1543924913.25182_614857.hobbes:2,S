I'm still not receiving the actual patch email on lsm (perhaps its too 
long and should be split up..) so I'll just respond on this email. Using 
the v10 patches on your website I'm still seeing strange behavior where 
echo foo > /proc/self/attr/current changes the label of every process on 
the system to foo (verified with both ps -AZ and cat /proc/1/attr/current).
