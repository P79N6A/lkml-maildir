How can I do this? I have installed mcelog but I
cannot run it after the MCE error because the whole PC
hangs. If I try it after a reboot with 'mcelog --k8
--ascii' or whatever parameter, there is no output at
all. If I try to redirect the output to the syslog,
nothing is in there because the computer stopped
working and did not save the log anymore.
Isn't it strange to say that the controller does
something bad if there is just a bad sector on the
drive that is reported and handled correctly in an
older kernel (I have confirmed a bad sector on the
drive using the Seatools software from Seagate)? In my
opinion a kernel should not stop responding at all
with a bad sector on the disk. I cannot change the
controller's behavior and did all the updates there
are to make in function, but the problem is introduced
using the newer kernel series.
Perhaps nobody has tried accessing a bad SATA drive
before, to simulate such an error? If it helps I could
try a different type of motherboard to see what
happens there? (Asus M2NPV-VM)

Hendrik
