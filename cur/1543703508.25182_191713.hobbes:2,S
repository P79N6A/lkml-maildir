If somebody actually got a module, written in C++, to compile and
work on linux-2.4.nn, as you state, it works only by fiat, i.e., was
declared to work. There is no C++ runtime support in the kernel for
C++. Are you sure this is a module and not an application? Many
network processes (daemons) are applications and they don't require
any knowledge of kernel internals except what's provided by the
normal C/C++ include-files.
Cheers,
