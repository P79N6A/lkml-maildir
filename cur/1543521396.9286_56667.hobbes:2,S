My motherboard #1 is a Atrend ATC-5200 with these chips
VIA, VT82C598MVP, 9833CE TAIWAN, 13G022600
VIA, VT82C586B, S7-SB, 9832CD TAIWAN, 12B014900
The 2nd one ( I guess DFI K6BV3+ )is currently in my office - I will
have a look on it on monday.
Well I bought two different boards with via chipset and both are crap -
this leads to trust in the future only in intel boards - which never
caused so much trouble. I guess I am not the only one with these
problems...
