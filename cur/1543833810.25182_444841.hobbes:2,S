No, Hans. I see a problem that has been fixed elsewhere in an identical
manner. The real solution is to eliminate / from block devices in the
long run, not to start introducing mount points with different pathname
interpretation rules. Those may have a place elsewhere, after a tough
uphill battle, and are most certainly overkill for this problem.
