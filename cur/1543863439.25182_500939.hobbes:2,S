An update from the earlier thread, 
[PATCH] [RFC] remove ext3 inode from orphan list when link and unlink race
I think this is better than the original idea of trying to handle the race;
I've seen that the orphan inode list can get corrupted, but there may well
be other implications of the race which haven't yet been exposed.  I think
it's safer to simply return -ENOENT in this race window, and avoid other
potential problems.  Anything wrong with this?
Thanks for the comments suggesting this approach in the prior thread.
Thanks,
-Eric

Return -ENOENT from ext[34]_link if we've raced with unlink and
i_nlink is 0.  Doing otherwise has the potential to corrupt the
orphan inode list, because we'd wind up with an inode with a
non-zero link count on the list, and it will never get properly
cleaned up & removed from the orphan list before it is freed.
