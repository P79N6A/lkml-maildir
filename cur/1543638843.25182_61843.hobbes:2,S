We are using 64 bit blocknumbers in reiser4, and letting linux limit 
them.  Perhaps my writing style was rather lacking in clarity.....
Linux is going to use some hacks in 2.5 that will let it go moderately 
above the 2.4 limits.  64 bit blocknumbers seem the most flexible thing 
in the face of what will be ever evolving hacks followed by the 
introduction of 64 bit CPUs into the mainstream.
