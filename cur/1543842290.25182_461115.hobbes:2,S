Its behaviour is also defined by the environment, so what gcc can assume 
is rather limited and you have not shown a single example, that any such 
assumption would be invalid for the kernel.

The kernel uses standard C, so your point is?
You already got two NACKs from arch maintainers, why the hell are you 
still pushing this patch? The builtin functions are useful and you want to 
force arch maintainers to have to enable every single one manually and 
to maintain a list of these functions over multiple versions of gcc?
