As I understand it, they want to apply the exec check against the
caller's credential as usual but not apply a read check against the
caller's credential.  This is just like the existing DAC checking (read
access to a program is not required to execute it under DAC, and you can
likely find examples of such programs in a /usr/bin near you - Xorg and
sudo are examples on a recent Fedora).  The reason it doesn't work for
them at present is that they are applying their check from the
dentry_open hook (in order to have the vfsmount available) rather than
from the inode_permission hook.
Note that they would have the same issue if they implemented
file_permission or mmap hooks that revalidate read permission (as in
SELinux).
Note btw that in the DAC case the dumpable flag gets cleared if the
caller lacks read access to the program, so TOMOYO should do likewise if
they are going to support this "execute-without-read" mode.
