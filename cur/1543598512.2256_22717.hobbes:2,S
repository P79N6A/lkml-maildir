Hello,
I have some questions, and I don't know where to ask them, so here it
goes... ( i guess here is the right place ... )
I have a machine, for which vmstat report something like
   procs                      memory      swap          io     system
cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free  inact active   si   so    bi    bo   in    cs us sy id
 3 25  1  48908   5264 402716 262664    0    0  2341   257 42633 28382 44 47  9
 5 14  1  48908   5616 409684 254960    0    0  2393   152 37703 26247 44 50  7
( when i run vmstat, the loadavg grows from 10 to 20 ... ), the machine is
dual Pentium3/coppermine/933, 1G ram. (booted with noapic, without that
parameter it crashes at least twice a day )
My question is - is 40k interrupts/30k context switches the maximum i can
squeeze from the machine? I need to optimize it a bit , but first I want
to locate the bottleneck, any help will be appreciated.
