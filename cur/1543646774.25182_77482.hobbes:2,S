I agree. bcopy should just DIE. Some architectures may have historical
trouble with gcc emitting bcopy for structure assignments (and that's
definitely a memcpy with no overlap), but I think that's long gone (I know 
gcc on alpha used to do this several years ago).
XFS seems to be a big user of bcopy, though..
