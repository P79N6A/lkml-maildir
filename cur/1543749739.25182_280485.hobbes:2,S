that's the short-term workaround. Another model for CPU-bound RT tasks
is the use of isolcpus. (see Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt)
but that's the thinking behind current RT scheduling: no global sorting
of priorities is done on SMP, but if you know the priorities and the
workload in advance you can manually bind them to specific CPUs.

this is obviously more experimental stuff, and feedback is welcome. It
is the current 'playground' for RT related scheduling features.
