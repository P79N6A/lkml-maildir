Only if you are doing something standard, like a regular box connected
to a regular ethernet.
What netmask should I specify to prevent adding the route on a network
10.0.1.0 with netmask 255.255.255.0 and host ip 10.0.1.20 ? Should
I use something other than network netmask, and if so, why? I don't want
this route, it is input-only interface.
It looks for me like Windows NT auto-administration, where you have to
set netmask to 255.255.240.0 (while it's really part of C class), because
other values cause problems.
Doing auto-route setup in ifconfig rather than in kernel, and providing
a switch to ifconfig to disable (or enable) this feature, would make
all of us happy - regular boxes would use simplified scripts, while
other machines wouldn't need to mess with netmasks and deleting routes.
