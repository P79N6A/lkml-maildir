This one works, thank you.
However, with the combination of in-kernel tg3 and
 CONFIG_IN_KERNEL_FIRMWARE=n there is at least a 30" delay
 during boot while waiting for the firmware request (which will fail).
Such wait didn't use to be there, and stuff worked. Could the wait
 be removed, to behave as it used to - as well ?
Thanks again, ciao,
