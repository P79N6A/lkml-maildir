Yeah, I think you'd actually end up with better behaviour by just sharing 
the lock logic, so I don't think there are any downsides there.

No, the cast would cast away any such differences, and since anybody would 
have to use asm for the actual implementation, the code can't care about 
the absense or presense of "volatile" anyway.
