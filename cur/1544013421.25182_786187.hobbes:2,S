Hi,
I get the following error from 'make modules_install' on my test boxes:
  HOSTCC  firmware/ihex2fw

where the configuration is that the kernel is compiled on a build box
with 'make O=<destdir> -j5' and then <destdir> is mounted over NFS read-only by
each test box (full path to this directory is the same on the build box and on
the test boxes).  Then, I cd into <destdir>, run 'make modules_install' and get
the error above.
2.6.28 didn't have this problem.
Thanks,
Rafael
