another reaction below in this thread reported kbd problems in vanilla 
2.6.22.1 as well. What is the X versions, etc.? Does the problem go away 
if the X kbd driver selection is tweaked to a simpler model, say:
 Section "InputDevice"
         Identifier  "Keyboard0"
         Driver      "kbd"
         Option      "XkbModel" "pc105"
         Option      "XkbLayout" "us"
         Option      "XkbVariant" "basic"
 EndSection

For a few days now I have been experiencing a "stuck delete" key while 
reading mail -- I run through the mail with "delete" and every once in a 
while it just keeps on deleting messages while I've already released the 
delete key and was trying to read the next message.
Regular unpatched 2.6.22.1 though and I've recently changed too many things 
to be certain of anything. My X is the modular X.org 1.3.0 since not long, 
and the mailer showing the problem is Thunderbird 2.0.0.5, recently switched 
from 1.5.0.12. The problem was on my "I'll get to it" list but seems this 
could be a good thread to report it into. PS/2 keyboard...
