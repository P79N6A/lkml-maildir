The problem right now is the *reverse* - even though they are in different 
subdirectories (and thus *look* like they are all separate), they aren't.
So the merged end result is much better: at a first approximation 
everything is shared (largely true), and the ones that aren't shared can 
be made more obvious.

So sharing is the default, as it should be.

And these are examples of things that likely *should* be shared, and have 
nothing what-so-ever to do with 32- vs 64-bit issues. For example, neither 
NUMA nor k8 is in *any* way a 32-bit vs 64-bit issue, they are issues with 
chips that can be used as either.

And this is obvious, and correct.

Now, arguably this should be entirely elsewhere (ie in the "mach-visw" 
directory).

.. and that's because of historical issues, and has nothing to do with the 
merge, and everything to do with all the problems that the merge is 
supposed to eventually help us FIX!

Yes. But so are others.

But none of it is "i386 only" and putting it in a directory of its own 
would be stupid and wrong. The visws.c thing is platform-specific thing, 
and the fact that the platform happens to be 32-bit is totally secondary 
to the much bigger issue of the *platform*, so again, it would be totally 
wrong to split it up by wordsize.

I obviously disagree violently. We should absolutely *not* make any of 
this depend on word-size. Quite the reverse!
