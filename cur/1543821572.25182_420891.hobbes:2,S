Hi all,
	to make short a long story:
	a) five pata disks Maxtor 500GB each one;
	b) one big software raid 5 (/dev/md1);[1]
	c) dmcrypt-ing /dev/md1;[2]
	d) after 500GB copied I've got fs corruption;[3]
	vanilla kernel, well tested hardware,[4] debian testing (to have
	dm-crypt).
	I'm using same configuration (md+dm-crypt+ext2/3) on other server,
	without problem, from years.
	It's first time I use it on big partitions (1.9TB), sure there are 
	situations with much bigger storage, and it's first time I've got
	problems. So:
	a) is anybody outthere using this kind of configuration with
	success?
	b) what can I do to debug the problem? I've spent last weeks
	working on hardware (dell servers mostly), to be sure to avoid
	hardware problems;
	c) has someone (OSDL?) regression tests on md+dm-crypt?
Thanks a lot for your time,
gelma

[3] usually metadata, files checksum is good, but I have a lot of files in
    /lost+found, after fsck, and sometimes I have to use debugfs to
    unlink some of them (chatt/lsatt doesn't work on them). I can see the
    problem with ext2/ext3/reiserfs. 
[4] memtest and so on. I also tried the same box of disks on totally
    different hardware, with same results. changed from ATA cable to RAM.
    I tried also different IDE controller (the one on motherbords, old HPT
    370/372, new HPT 302).
