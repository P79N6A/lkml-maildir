Subject: PCI devices (tulip and vortex ethernet cards) grab IRQ 0 :-(

Hi:
I have a new HP 6470Z.  The only ethernet card that Linux can use is an
ISA 3Com 509.  I've tried the Netgear Tulip (with the real DEC chip) and
the 3Com 905 PCI 10/100 cards, but they show up with IRQ 0 and then
don't work (not surprising).  The machine has redhat v5.2 with the 2.2.4
kernel.  The same behaviour was observed with the stock redhat kernel as
well.  Windows 98 can find the PCI ethernet cards.  How is the IRQ
selected?  How can I get Linux to correctly configure the PCI cards?
