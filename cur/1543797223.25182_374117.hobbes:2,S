You are right. I hit the problem when I compiled kernel 2.6.9 on IA64 by intel compiler.
cpu_relax has the compiler barrier if we use gcc, but cpu_relax becomes just ia64_hint which is null when I use intel compiler to compile kernel on ia64. file include/asm-ia64/intel_intrin.h defines ia64_hint as null.
Function stopmachine in kernel/stop_machine.c uses cpu_relax to prevent compiler from moving the reading of stopmachine_state out of the while loop. But when we use intel compiler, cpu_relax doesn't work because it is just null.
The right approach is to define ia64_hint to ia64_barrier in file include/asm-ia64/intel_intrin.h. I tested the new approach and it does work.
Thank Arjan, Pavel, and Venki.
