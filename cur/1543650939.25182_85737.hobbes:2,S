You're making the assumption that the biggest problem facing embedded
Linux developers is that the kernel is too big and that the size must be
reduced at all costs.  It's not.  It's that trying to tweak things which
aren't trivial to do (unlike changing the optimization level) require an
indepth knowledge of the subsystem.  It doesn't have to be this way.
