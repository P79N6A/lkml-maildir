When bk6 comes out tomorrow, I will give it a try and write down the Oops
message by hand when/if it occurs again.  It seems that on June 20th, there
was a large list of changes.  But I have a feeling this has to do with
something using an invalid irq.  Starting with kernel 2.6.7-bk3, the ACPI on
the VIA chipsets seem to now be handling irqs differently.  The ACPI
messages in dmesg have significantly changed:
PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKC] enabled at IRQ 5
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:0b.0[A] -> GSI 5 (level, low) -> IRQ 5
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKB] enabled at IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:0e.0[A] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKA] enabled at IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:11.1[A] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:11.2[D] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:11.3[D] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:11.4[D] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:11.5[C] -> GSI 5 (level, low) -> IRQ 5
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:01:00.0[A] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
Best Regards..
