Hi Marius,

all of the Acer dongles are small and black, but not all of them use the
same Bluetooth chip :)

The problem is not the USB subsystem. It is the manufacturer of the
Bluetooth chip, because some of them didn't read the Bluetooth HCI spec.
part H2 carefully. At least every H2 USB Bluetooth device must have two
ISOC endpoints. Even if they don't support SCO voice transfer.
