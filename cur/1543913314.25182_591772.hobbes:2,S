Ouch, you're right!
And that's been around for a *long* time.  From the original 0.9.2
version (Dec 9th 2002).  ChangeLog says:
	Jim Radford <radford@blackbean.org>'s modprobe -r implementation.
The userspace check still stops most cases of removing used modules.
On the bright side, this one bug has probably done more to deprecate
module removal than any thing else, by making it unreliable...
Good catch!
Rusty.
