Not sure where to post this, forgive me if there is a better place to 
post...
I'm trying to use pivot_root() to change root to a directory that is not 
a mount point, i.e. it is under a mount point of a different device from 
the current root device.
E.g.
# /root is mounted from /dev/sda1
pivot_root("/root/somewhere", "/root/somewhere/initrd");
But pivot_root() returns EINVAL. Both /root/somewhere and 
/root/somewhere/initrd exists.
Any pointers about what might be wrong? Many thanks :)
