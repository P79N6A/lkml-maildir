I assume you know the meaning of the words "bloat" and "proliferation".
A portable application needs the BSD interface anyhow, and adding
another interface just for Linux makes it a testing/maintenance and thus
a reliability nightmare.
I wouldn't call the netlink example that's been posted here "trivial"
with its 215 lines.  You don't seriously expect a portable program to
add 200 lines of C to pull 5 bits of entropy out of the Linux kernel
where ANY other kernel does it with 4 lines of C, and Linux could do it
as well.
If people only commented (not flamed) constructively on my patch rather
than adding fuel to this unnecessary fire.
