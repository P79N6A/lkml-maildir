I'm not sure there is, actually...

... last I checked, usrquota and grpquota weren't being propagated in,
but that's changed sometime in the last, um, wow, has it been two

None presently, but in general it seems strange to have to modify the
kernel in order to be able to reliably associate some new key/value pair
with a mount point, let alone to have to do it on a filesystem-by-
filesystem basis...
