Question is then, what about keeping a main trunk with the vanialle
release, and each dev has its own branch. now at a certain point you
have to merge them. Now where is the difference between a central rep
and a de-central one.
At day X, patches from Andrew's tree have to go to Linus tree and from
his tree into the new vanialla kernel. right?
Somehow I can't see the difference here.
