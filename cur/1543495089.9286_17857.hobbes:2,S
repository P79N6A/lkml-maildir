If you are using copy_to_user and the interrupt driven updates are not
"continuous", one option is to maintain separate fields which hold an
update count and an update in progress flag.  Pseudo code
atomic_t my_update_count = 0;
char my_data[32768];
i = atomic_read(&my_update_count);
do {
	copy_to_user(user_addr, my_data, sizeof(my_data));
} while (i != atomic_read(&my_update_count));
The interrupt driven code does atomic_inc(&my_update_count).  Your
suggestion of disabling interrupts, taking a copy, enabling interrupts
and copying to user space has the overhead of an extra 32K copy every
time and a reasonably long irq off period which can impact the rest of
the kernel.  The above pseudo code has an overhead of two atomic_read
plus an occasional extra copy and does not disable interrupts.
The only problem with this sort of approach is resource starvation.  If
interrupt driven updates come faster than you can copy to user space
then it loops forever.  Mind you, in that situation, a disabled
interrupt copy is going to loose interrupts like nobody's business.
ps.  The above is not SMP safe, only irq safe.  It can be made SMP safe
     but is more complicated.
