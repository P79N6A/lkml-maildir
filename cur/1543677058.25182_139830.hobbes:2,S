IMO this is to be expected and not a problem. In the case of offset of
'-1' the time will jump one usec forward on the timer interrupt, but
that's harmless and nothing worse should happen.

The devel hardware's RTC crystals are quite a bit off the correct
frequency, but still in the range fixable by NTP.

Looks OK to me.
