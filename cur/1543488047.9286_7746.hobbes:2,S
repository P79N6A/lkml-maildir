Wonderful. So what will happen if we will include that sock (unhashed, all
such, but referenced from the skb in listen queue) into the stack, add few
more from the same queue and then try to pop them?

Yes, you are. unix_release_sock() doesn't take the peer skb out of the listen
queue. Heck, that's what your own exploit is based upon - you are creating
connection and closing it without accept() on the other side and it leaves
peer skb's in the listen queue.
