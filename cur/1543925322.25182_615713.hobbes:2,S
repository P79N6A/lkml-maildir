Subject: [PATCH 0/6] MN10300: Add the MN10300 architecture to Linux kernel [try #5]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/9/82

These patches add the MEI/Panasonic MN10300/AM33 architecture to the Linux
kernel.
The first patch suppresses A.OUT support in the kernel if CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT=n
and CONFIG_IA32_AOUT=n and CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT32=n.  MN10300 does not support
the AOUT binfmt, so the ELF binfmt should not be permitted to go looking for
AOUT libraries to load, nor should random bits of the kernel depend on
asm/a.out.h.
The fifth patch adds the architecture itself, to be selected by ARCH=mn10300 on
the make command line.
The patches can also be downloaded from:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/mn10300/mn10300-arch.tar.bz2
A suitable toolchain can be downloaded from:
	
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/gnupro/AM33/
The latest is currently:
	am33-04r2-5/tools/i686-pc-linux-gnulibc2.3-x-am33_2.0-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
Changes:
 (*) Fixed various Makefile stuff.
 (*) Fixed up copyright banners.
