I took this out for a spin in stock 74.  If I do while true; do sh -c 'ps l 
$$'; date; sleep 1; done, the shell is running at priority 22.  In the face 
of any load, that leads to quite long response times.  With a make -j5 
bzImage running, I frequently saw response times of over a second.  In X, 
with a make -j2 bzImage running, opening a new shell takes too long, and X 
loses interactive status considerably quicker than stock when doing window 
wiggle.  Init is at 20, and kernel threads bounce around between 15 and 20 
depending on how active they are (doesn't seem good considering they're 
using practically no cpu).
Thud is still dead, but maybe _too_ dead ;-)  I never saw it get above the 
lowest priority, which is very unfair considering the amount of sleeping it 
does.
