True, but perhaps in this case it's time for POSIX to move, the things 
in filesystems, and which are used as filesystems have changed a bunch.
It would be nice to have a neutral standard rather than adopting 
existing extended implementations, just because the politics of it are 
that everyone but MS would hate NTFS, MS would hate any of the existing 
others, and a new standard would have the same impact on everyone and 
therefore might be viable. Not a quick fix, however, standards take a 
LONG time.
