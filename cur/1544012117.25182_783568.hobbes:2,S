I have been on holiday since last week and I don't really have time to 
comment on all this until my return from great ski weeks, but I have 
been following the discussion very attentively and I will for sure test 
and comment on these patches (camera is very important for our 
application) as soon as I get back to work in January.
It's a bit tricky with this merge window in the "middle" of holidays for me.
