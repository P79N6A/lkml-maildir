Ah, interesting idea: realtime tasks get to dip into the PF_MEMALLOC reserve, 
until it gets down to some threshold, then they have to give up and wait like 
any other unwashed nobody of a process.  _But_ if there's a user space 
process sitting in the writeout path and some other realtime process eats the 
entire realtime reserve, everything can still grind to a halt.
So it's interesting for realtime, but does not solve the userspace PF_MEMALLOC 
inversion.

Not just tight, but bounded.  And tight too, of course.

The PF_MEMALLOC flag is inherited down a call chain, not across a pipe or 
similar IPC to user space.

That's the problem.
