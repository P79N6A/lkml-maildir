(I read kerneltraffic instead, as I'm lazy :)
Having checked the FAQ + KT + Archives, I can't find
any details for how to use my DMA-66 drive and interface
under Linux, preferably as a boot disk. I can set my BIOS
to boot from DMA-66, so all I need now are the drivers :)
If this is a stupid question, flame away :)
Motherboard is a ABIT BP-6 with a pair of Celerons,
drive is a Quantum Fireball KA, and I'm happy to test
"try this" patches. Currently running the standard
Redhat 6.0 SMP kernel, (2.2.5 with patches) but happy
to change to whatever (which'll break my SB Live, but that'll
teach me to use binary only drivers)
