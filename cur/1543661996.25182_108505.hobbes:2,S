That should be impossible to do. :)
Write a simple handler for parport or so, that is called when line #1
toggles from low to high and responds by pulling line #2 from low to
high.
Now hook up a signal generator and an oszilloscope and measure the
time from signal generation to the physical reaction.
This way you get all the latency, not just the small amount you can
measure inside the kernel.
