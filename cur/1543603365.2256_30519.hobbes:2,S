Well, upgrading to a recent 2.4 kernel gives you the possebility to use
the TCPMSS target in iptables which resolves your problems.
I'm also running a Linux masquerading box on a ADSL (T-DSL) line and I have 
no problems at all (I can access the site you mentioned fine) with
the following line in iptables:
$IPTABLES -I FORWARD -j TCPMSS -o $FW_WORLD_DEV --clamp-mss-to-pmtu -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN
Cheers,
Juri
