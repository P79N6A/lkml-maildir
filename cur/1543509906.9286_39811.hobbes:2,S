Subject: compile warnings in 2.3.18ac6

I get the following compile warnings:
/usr/src/linux-2.3.18ac/Rules.make:263: target `uart401.o' given more than 
once in the same rule.
/usr/src/linux-2.3.18ac/Rules.make:263: target `uart401.o' given more than 
once in the same rule.
mtrr.c:317: warning: `main_lock' defined but not used
fault.c: In function `do_page_fault':
fault.c:115: warning: `sem' might be used uninitialized in this function
Root device is (3, 8)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 2484 bytes.
System is 566 kB
The Rules.make problem has been previously reported and is being looked
at I suppose.  At least I did get feedback on it.
The main_lock defined but not used puzzles me though since it IS used
later in the source file.  I don't see any #ifdefs which might excise
the section of code it's used in.
