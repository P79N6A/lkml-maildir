but that does not appear to be the case, the debug info i got from Roman 
includes the following boot options:
  Kernel command line: auto BOOT_IMAGE=2.6.23-rc1-git9 ro root=306
there's no "notsc" option there.
Andi's theory cannot be true either, Roman's debug info also shows this 
/proc/<PID>/sched data:
  clock-delta              :                  95
that means that sched_clock() is in high-res mode, the TSC is alive and 
kicking and a sched_clock() call took 95 nanoseconds.
Roman, could you please help us with this mystery?
