OK, I now have a binary dynamically linked against /lib/libc.so.6,
(according to ldd), and that points to glibc-2.1.92.  And I tried setting
the environment variables you suggested, I checked that they are set and
checked that they appear in /lib/libc.so.6.  But the behaviour is
unchanged:  MAGMA still hits this barrier at 830M (not 870M, that was a
typo).
I guess I conclude that either (1) MAGMA does not use libc's malloc
(checking on this, I doubt it) or (2) glibc-2.1.92 knows of these
variables but has not yet implemented the tuning (I'll try glibc-2.2) or
(3) this is not the problem.
I'll look at Andrea's hack as well.  Thanks for everybody's help!
Cheers, Wayne
