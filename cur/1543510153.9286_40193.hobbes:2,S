While discussing the min() max() issues with DaveM, I'd suggest you prepare
a patch which adds -fno-builtins to the Makefile and makes the abs() work.
stddef.h is fine, IMHO.
I see no reasons why it should not be accepted.
Wait: What about the speed of builtin memcpy and the routines provided by
the kernel? I think I remember a discussion about his. Anybody?
