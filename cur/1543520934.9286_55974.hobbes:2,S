ANSI/ISO C defines time_t as a signed arithmetic type, so
such a change would break correct code.
Note that the use of types not listed in the standard
as the base type for time_t will also break correct code.
This includes _long _long.
Personally, I'd wait for the new ISO C's "long long" type
and use that as the base type of time_t.  This would be 64
bits on a 32 bit architecture.

Fixing the problem now requires increasing the size of "long"
where it is currently 32 bits.  This probably isn't a good idea.
