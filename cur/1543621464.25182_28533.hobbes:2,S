Not necessarily. If the gradual change infers intermediate functions
that are not needed for a hard cut-over, it's no good to do all the
extra work if the already-existing result is known to work. I'd
certainly not drop CML1 from 2.4, but 2.5 is the time for changes.
You don't take an airplane to drive alongs autobahns for a gradual
change either.
It seems to me as though the "rip out existing" issue was rather a
"don't let us maintain two parts of the same type at the same time"
convenience feature than a trait of CML2, and if so, keep both for some
releases and drop CML1 in, say, 2.5.8.
