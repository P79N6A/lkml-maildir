On powerbooks you disable the nonboot CPUs before suspending devices, which
simplifies things _a_ _lot_ in comparison with the general case.
If you additionally disable kernel preemption, then you don't need anything
like the freezer anyway in that case (except for detecting situations in which
the suspend process can deadlock with a task stuck in the D state holding a
lock, but that's overkill).
