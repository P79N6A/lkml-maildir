Not informative.  Why doesn't UNLINK work as-is?
If there's a bug in how that's handled, better to fix it.
I'd be willing to believe there is one, given proof.

I certainly didn't say that, any more than you said
that there's no such thing as an engineering tradeoff!
(With which statement I'd likewise disagree.)
But I certainly did mean to say that I was skeptical
you were actually running into one particular race,
which I've had an eye on for some time.  (And which
shouldn't have the failure mode you reported, though
some other things might...)

It's entered in usb_unlink_urb() as always.  So as I
noted, your patch would make drivers BUG() in cases
that are perfectly reasonable according to the API.

As I've said more than once on this thread.
