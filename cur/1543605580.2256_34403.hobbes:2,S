You have to be prepared to handle both immediate and delayed
connection, especially if you want to be portable.  (Solaris behaves 
a bit differently than Linux in this regard.)  See
http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/dkftpbench-0.37/ftp_client_pipe.cc
for an example of how to handle nonblocking connects more or less portably.
(You have to wade through quite a bit of code, tabstops 4, to find
all the connect-handling stuff -- sorry.)
