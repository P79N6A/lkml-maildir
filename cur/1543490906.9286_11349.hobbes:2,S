Hi,
I have a question on large IDE drive. For IDE HD > 8.4GB, # of
cyliners is > 1024. The kernel always report
	CHS=1024/255/63
That means I cannot use anything above 8.4GB unless I play with
fdisk. However, the kernel reports the correct size of the HD.
That is idedisk_capacity () knows the correct geometry. Is there
a way for fdisk to get the correct HD geometry from the kernel
without breaking things? Since I can use fdisk to set the
HD geometry to use the whole HD, I don't see why the kernel
cannot do it for me.
Thanks.
