EIP is set 0000FFF0H
CS is set F000H
After RESET, lines A31-A20 are FORCED high till a far JMP is done.
So, unfortunately we have to say Linus is right once again. Damn ;-) My 
conclusion is that we are unable to use the CPU reset as the reference for 
warm boots, for we can't control A312-A20 in real mode. But as far as I can 
see, my arguments still hold...
