Hi Linus,
Here's a small optimization for the mm/filemap.c file.
	- The `head = &mapping->pages;' statement is useless inside the
	  repeat, since head isn't modified inside the loop.
	- The `curr = curr->next;' statement doesn't need to be executed
	  if the repeat is taken. I changed the while() into a for() loop
	  to accomodate this better.
Share and enjoy!
