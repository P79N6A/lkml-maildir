Hi,
I have downloaded linux kernel 2.4. 
In /usr/src, I did untar the file: 
gzip -cd  linux-2.4.0.tar.gz  | tar xvf - 
I see several files being copied to several locations (/linux/Documentation, 
/linux/arch/..etc..). The problem is that there's no linux 2.4   directory created 
under /usr/src or anywhere else on my system! Anyway, there's nothing new 
under /usr/src!!! 
Linux is not new to me, so I know that this is weird ( I even tried it with  "tar -zxvf  linux-2.4.0.tar.gz", "gzcat  linux-2.4.0.tar.gz | tar xvf - " ..etc). Same result. 
Anyway, let's say that it doesn't matter whether there's a new kernel 2.4 directory or not..
how can I make sure that I  am  re-compiling my kernel (currently kernel 2.2.5) with 
the right 2.4 kernel?? (Kernel howto talks about going to /usr/src/linux and start compiling..but current /usr/src/linux is a link to my current 2.2.5 kernel !!!)
Current OS: Red Hat Linux 6.0 Kernel 2.2.5
Thanks
