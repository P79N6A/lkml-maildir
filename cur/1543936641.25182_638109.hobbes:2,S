Hmm...good questions and I haven't checked either.  The first one is 
relatively straightforward.  The second is a bit trickier...last time I 
tried the latest e1000 driver the card wouldn't boot (we use netboot).

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to try this.  We require 
kernel mods for our userspace to run, and I doubt I'd be able to get the 
time to port all the changes forward to git head.

It's conceivable that userspace is starving the kernel, but we have do 
about 45% idle on one cpu, and 7-10% idle on the other.
We also have an odd situation where on an initial test run after bootup 
we have 18-24% idle on cpu1, but resetting the test tool drops that to 
the 7-10% I mentioned above.
Based on profiling and instrumentation it seems like the cost of 
sctp_endpoint_lookup_assoc() more than triples, which means that the 
amount of time that bottom halves are disabled in that function also 
triples.
