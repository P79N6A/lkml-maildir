Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core patches against 2.6.25-git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/30/580

Here are a few remaining patches against your 2.6.25-git tree.
They provide a few apis that Tejun needs for other trees, and the
biggest of all is the removal of 'struct class_device' now that it is
purged from your tree through all of the different subsytem merges.
There's also a build fix in there from Randy and a few other minor
things that people have posted problems with.
All of these patches have been in -next for a while.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
