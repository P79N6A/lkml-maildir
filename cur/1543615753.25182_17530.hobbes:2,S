Unless you have i2o hardware  please leave that code alone. It just creates
more maintenance nightmares. I2O on 2.5.x is broken anyway and will oops
when loaded with or without you changes. I know about this. I will look at
it once the block layer changes are stable.
There are 32/64bit bugs, endian assumptions, and the complete absence of the
use of the PCI dma API to deal with too.
