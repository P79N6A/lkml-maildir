So you're saying that sys_alarm(0xffffffff) needs to behave as
sys_alarm(0x7ffffffff)?
I guess if we have to do it that way, the risk of breaking anything is very
small.
What's the 2.4/2.6.13 behaviour of sys_alarm(0xffffffff)?

What does 2.4/2.6.13 do?   Let's do that.
If you're proposing that we depart from previous behaviour by converting
setitimer(0xffffffff) into setitimer(0x7fffffff) then I guess we could live
with that.

No, we cannot warn - it'll enable unprivileged users to spam the logs.
One could generate a once-per-reboot warning, I guess.  The message should
include the PID and current->comm.
