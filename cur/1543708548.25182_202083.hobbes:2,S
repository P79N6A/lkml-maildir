Oddly enough I've been having trouble with ieee1394 too for quite some time (I 
was beginning to think my drive boxes were dead for some reason), and much to 
my pleasure your little trick works.

I however don't have the same problems you describe. Newer versions just 
simply fail to see anything attached to the ieee1394 bus. I'm using a via 
epia M10000. I saw a report similar to mine on the 1394 list, but it went 
unanswered.

I'll be the first one to agree with ben that this is a bad idea.

Unfortunately, I don't have any crashes, errors, or anything else helpful. 
I've tried different settings for debugging, none showed anything more 
revealing.
If there is anything that I can do (extra debugging patches, etc.) these boxes 
were bought for testing, and that's what they shall do.
