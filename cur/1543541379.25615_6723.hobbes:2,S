i done this now as macro, and i came to other def. Could it be 
useful for someone to have this in major.h?:
static __inline__ int disk_blk_major(int m) {
	        return (SCSI_BLK_MAJOR(m)||IDE_BLK_MAJOR(m));
}
i personally think that not, coz i don't see such tests anywhere in the 
code, but what if ...
However, i'll do some if-it-can-even-compile tests on my patches, and if
it'll works i'll post final patch against test6.
