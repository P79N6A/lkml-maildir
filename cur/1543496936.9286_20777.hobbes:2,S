I receive packets from my fieldbus driver. I want to do the
protocol-stuff in userland. How can I pass the raw packets up to a
socket created by a userland application? 
of cause I would like to limit my coding to the driver module and keep
my fingers away from the original kernel files. 
I guess it must be something about skb->mac.raw, skb->nh.raw and
skb->h.raw.
But I do seem to need to register a protocol type with the network core
so my packets would not get droped. Is this right? What else do I need
to get my packets though to userland with minimal effort?
