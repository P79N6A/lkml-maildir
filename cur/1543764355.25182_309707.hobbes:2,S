The NMI code had better be really careful, and yeah, I suspect it needs 
fixing.

That's a good argument, and may be the strongest reason for _not_ doing 
the speculation. However, I don't think it really can happen anywhere 
else. 
If people feel very nervous about the speculation, we can certainly just 
make it do the two branches. It _is_ a hotspot, though, and the 
optimization of the speculatiom may well be worth it.
