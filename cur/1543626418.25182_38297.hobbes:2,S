You should be able to see easily if it is being checked by a forced
fsck, from a message like "maximal mount count reached, forcing fsck".
You can use the "tune2fs -c" option to increase the number of mounts
between full checks (or "tune2fs -c 0" to turn it off, and then use
"tune2fs -i 1m" to reduce the interval between checks to once a month or
whatever).  Note that it is _strongly_ recommended NOT to turn off both
mount- and time-based forced fscks on your filesystem, because things
like bad kernels, bad disks, RAM, cables, etc can still cause corruption.
Note also that some laptops can lose data at shutdown (even on a clean
shutdown) because their disks have problems with flushing the cache.
Cheers, Andreas
