Yes, but you will need many disk space,
issue this command and try to make the dump 
availlable to the tcp/ip people...
Be carrefull, all information passing on your network node will be availlable
in this file ( so use thing like openssh instead of telnet :) ).
tcpdump -s2000 -vvv -w dump
If this is a problem in linux tcp/ip stack, we should be able
to find it using this file..
see you
