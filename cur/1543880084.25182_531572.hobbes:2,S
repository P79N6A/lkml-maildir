Umm, is "allowuser" more clear than "usermnt"?  What is allowed to the
user?  "allowusermnt" may be more descriptive, but it's a bit too
long.
I don't think it matters all that much, the user will have to look up
the semantics in the manpage anyway.  Is "nosuid" descriptive?  Not
very much, but we got used to it.
