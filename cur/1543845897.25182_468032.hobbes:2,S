Subject: [PATCH 0/6]: powerpc/cell spidernet ethernet patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/29/323

Please apply and forward upstream as appropriate.
Although these patches have not been baking in 
any -mm tree, they have been tested and are 
generally available as a part of the Cell SDK 2.0
overseen by Arnd Bergmann. (Arnd, if you want
to lend a voice of authority here, or to correct 
me, please do so...)
The following sequence of six patches implement a 
series of changes to the transmit side of the 
spidernet ethernet device driver, significantly 
improving performance for large packets.
This series of patches is almost identical to 
those previously mailed on 18-20 August, with one
critical change: NAPI polling is used instead of 
homegrown polling.
Although these patches improve things, I am not
satisfied with how this driver behaves, and so 
plan to do additional work next week.
