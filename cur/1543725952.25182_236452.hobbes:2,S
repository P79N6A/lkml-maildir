The problem is not people's email clients, the problem is that xterm,
gnome-terminal, and konsole all mangle tabs to spaces when copying
text.  There is nothing the mailer can do about it.  For now the only
fix for people using an X environment is to pipe to a text file and then
use their email client's 'insert file' feature.  There is an open Debian
bug report for xterm regarding this issue, I encourage everyone bothered
by this to add comments.
I realize it has always been this way, but people coming from any other
OS expect to be able to copy and paste a tab and have it stay a tab.
Many other devel lists encourage patches be sent as MIME attachents due
to this issue.  I would prefer that the console apps be fixed.
