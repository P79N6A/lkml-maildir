Thanks for the explanation.
But, BTW, this seemed not to have been clear for the authors of your
system programming guide. May-be you should make sure that the below is
also well known at Intel.  But my english is not so good and it may have
happened that I missed something important from the guide. If it is the
case, you may want to let us know what part of the doc we should not have
missed. 
Thanks in advance.
Gérard.
PS: I didn't see the correct explanation from the guys that claimed that 
    the single store was just fine for the spin_unlock(). This seems 
    strange to me given that I cannot beleive such a knowledge to be 
    required to be innate.
