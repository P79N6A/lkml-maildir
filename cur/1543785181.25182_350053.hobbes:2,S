That's a nice size reduction.  If we had kzalloc_gfp_kernel(size_t) we
could drop an argument and save even more, but I suspect Linus would come
after me with a cattle prod.
Note that the use of kzalloc() will nullify kmalloc's compile-time
optimisation where it determines which slab to use at compile time -
kzalloc() won't know the size and will have to do the table search.  But
the performance benefit from text size reductions will balance that.
SELinux seems to do a lot of kzalloc(a * b, flags):
 +	mysids = kzalloc(maxnel*sizeof(*mysids), GFP_ATOMIC);
 +	*names = (char**)kzalloc(sizeof(char*) * *len, GFP_ATOMIC);
 +	mysids2 = kzalloc(maxnel*sizeof(*mysids2), GFP_ATOMIC);
Consider using kcalloc() here.
