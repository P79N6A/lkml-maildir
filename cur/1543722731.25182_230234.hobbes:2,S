Ha Anton - you cannot read.
I complain about this strange casting, and you start talking about hardcoded
values (while you write 0xaa55 yourself). The current code is below - a good
name and no hardcoded constants and no strange casts.
Andries
#define MSDOS_LABEL_MAGIC1      0x55
#define MSDOS_LABEL_MAGIC2      0xAA
static inline int
msdos_magic_present(unsigned char *p)
{
        return (p[0] == MSDOS_LABEL_MAGIC1 && p[1] == MSDOS_LABEL_MAGIC2);
}
