I would't let this happen, ever. What if foo does exist and Aunt Tillie
just didn't compile it?

The "provides" is the missing clue... You are taking about "provides" (and
mixing it up with "alias", something I still can't agree on), I'm talking
about "alias". Maybe they should be separate? In your examples netlink
_provides_ char-major-36, xyz3000 _provides_ binfmt-754, eepro100 _aliases_
to eth0 here. First use is clearly in-kernel, second one is (or should
always be IMVHO) out-of-kernel. Sure, could use the same infrastructure for
simplicity.
Now, what if xyz and zyx both provide foo? This will be the case when a new
driver comes along...
[This is looking more and more like a task for rpm/apt...
 /me ducks and runs]
Thanks for your patience!
