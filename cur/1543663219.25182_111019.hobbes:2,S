Sorry, I didn't mean to state that the bug was in the processor. 
The systems consistently hard locks in any accelerated application. The
mem=nopentium does not seem to help at all.
Are there any dependencies that must be taken care of to implement the
new fix? Also, should I be seeing any dmesg output from this new
implementation?
Are there any debugging techniques I could use to track the cause? (I
have no log outputs due to hard lock)
If it helps, here is my hardware config:
	AMD Duron 1300MHZ
	MSI K7T Turbo-2
	ATI Radeon 7500 w/64mb
	Redhat 8.0
Thanks again for any information,
	Craig Sowadski (sowadski@umr.edu)

It's actually not an AMD bug, but an Linux bug that assumed undefined

Yes, there is a new mechanism to address the problem the adv-spec-cache
patch solved. It enforces that there are not conflicting cache
attributes
for memory mappings.

What problem exactly? And does mem=nopentium help ?
