>(1) ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES EXPORT REVISIONS, PRIVACY ADVOCATES 
REMAIN 
>SKEPTICAL
>
>Just as the SAFE Act was about to come to the House floor, the Clinton 
>Administration has announced plans to ease long-standing export controls on 
>encryption products. The changes, if actually delivered as proposed, could 
>make it much easier for people all over the world to gain access to the 
>strongest encryption. At the same time, however, the White House announced 
>its support for new legislation giving government officials access to 
>sensitive decryption keys, when held by third parties, without full Fourth 
>Amendment privacy protections. 
>
>Documents detailing the new policy are available on CDT's web site at
>
http://www.cdt.org/crypto/.
 Major features of the new policy include:
>
>* Export Relief -- The Administration plans to release revised regulations 
>in December allowing export of "retail" encryption products of unlimited 
>strength, subject to a one-time technical review, reporting requirements, 
>and restrictions on sales to the seven terrorist nations. 
>
>* Administration Support for New Law Enforcement Access Standards - The 
>White House to support the Cyberspace Security Enhancement Act (CESA). While 
>abandoning "secret search" provisions floated last month, the bill would 
>establish standards for law enforcement access to decryption keys held by 
>third parties. 
>
>The devil is in the details when it comes to encryption regulations, and CDT 
>will be watching carefully to see that the promised export relief is 
>actually reflected in the new regulations without hedges or discretionary 
>exceptions.  Congressional backers of the SAFE Act, Wwhich would lift most 
>encryption export controls, have vowed to keep the pressure up. Meanwhile, 
>though, they are expected to postpone a vote on SAFE pending satisfactory 
>regulations from the Administration.
>
>CDT remains concerned that the access provisions in the new CESA bill  fall 
>short of the kind of protections needed in the evolving networked 
>environment.
>

>(2) THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS: EXPORT CONTROLS
>
>The Administration policy, if implemented as promised, would represent a 
>major change in U.S. export policy. As described by White House officials, 
>widely-available encryption products like 128-bit web browsers or PGP 
>software would be exportable to all but a few countries after a technical 
>review and subject to reporting requirements about who the product was 
>shipped to.
>
>Officials say that under regulations due to be released before the end of 
>the year:
>
>* "Retail" encryption hardware and software of unlimited strength could be 
>exported without a license after a "one-time technical review" and subject 
>to post-export reporting of transfers. Reporting is to be limited to the 
>information that "companies normally collect" (i.e., who the product was 
>transferred to, not who the end user was.)
>
>* Non-retail "custom" products would face further restrictions on sales to 
>foreign governments and identified terrorist or criminal organizations.
>
>* Export of encryption products with bit lengths up to 64 bits would be 
>entirely decontrolled.
>
>As described, the regulations would represent an abandonment of the U.S. 
>policy that had been based on bit-length limits and the promotion of key 
>recovery. 
> 
>A remaining concern is whether the regulations will in fact give the broad 
>relief promised. On more than one occasion in the years since the failed 
>1993 Clipper Chip proposal, hopes for substantial progress on encryption 
>policy have failed to provide comprehensive reform. (For some examples, see 
>CDT's "History of Administration Encryption Policy" on the Web at
>
http://www.cdt.org/crypto/admin/initiatives.shtml
)
>
>In addition, the announcement leaves many export controls problems 
>unresolved. For example, cryptographic researchers and small encryption 
>distributors would apparently remain unable to easily distribute encryption 
>without satisfying the federal regulatory process. Challenges to these 
>restrictions - such as the Bernstein, Karn, and Junger cases - will remain 
>important in asserting the First Amendment rights of encryption publishers.

>(3) THE PROPOSED CESA BILL AND GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO KEYS
>
>CDT remains concerned that the provisions of the new CESA legislation will 
>not adequately protect the privacy of sensitive decryption keys in the new 
>online environment.
>
>Major provisions of CESA include:
>
>* Prohibits the disclosure of decryption information, when held by third 
>parties, without appropriate legal authority as spelled out in the bill.
>
>* Requires disclosure of keys to government agents with a court order, when 
>needed to decrypt information where there is no "constitutional expectation 
>of privacy" in the underlying plaintext. Many privacy protections stem from 
>laws passed by Congress and not from the Constitution directly. Under this 
>provision, keys could be readily accessible for sensitive encrypted 
>information stored with third parties such as financial records, medical 
>records, or in fact any encrypted data stored on a network server or with an 
>ISP.
>
>* Authorizes  million for the FBI's Tech Center, designed to promote law 
>enforcement tools and techniques for defeating encryption.
>
>* Prohibits disclosure in open court of the techniques used to obtain the 
>plaintext of encrypted information. A delicate legal balance has been struck 
>over time between the rights of defendants and the need to protect law 
>enforcement agents and methods. This new provision could undermine that 
>balance and the ability of citizens to receive a fair trial.
>
>CESA no longer includes "secret search" authority allowing government agents 
>to secretly break into people's homes and install "recovery devices" on 
>their computer if they did not use key recovery. The bill also no longer 
>contains other provisions to promote the use of key recovery.
>
>CDT remains concerned that CESA's provisions do not require the more 
>stringent showing of "probable cause" and notice of a seizure that the 
>Fourth Amendment would demand of keys taken from a person's own computer or 
>data seized from one's own house. In the Information Age, more and more of 
>our most personal data is moving out of the desk drawer and off of the 
>desktop computer and out onto the Internet. CESA has opened a new and 
>complex debate about the standards that are needed to protect sensitive data 
>in networked electronic storage.
