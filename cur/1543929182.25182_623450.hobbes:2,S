Then you would have to do this for tons other *_for_each*, such as
hlist_for_each, etc, but:
[acme@doppio net-2.6.25]$ find . -name "*.[ch]" | xargs grep
'_for_each[a-z_]*(' | wc -l
4370
[acme@doppio net-2.6.25]$ find . -name "*.[ch]" | xargs grep
'_for_each[a-z_]* (' | wc -l
160
[acme@doppio net-2.6.25]$
I'd say that the common practice in the * _for_each_* use is to do just
what checkpatch does right now, complain if the is a space. Ah, and that
is also my personal preference 8-)
