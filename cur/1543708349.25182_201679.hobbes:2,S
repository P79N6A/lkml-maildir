Hi,
I need to build a six disk IDE md raid-5 with-in a month, Is here anyone and
recommed some PATA or SATA chip which is known to be trouble free and kernel
2.6.x friendly?
I found in the market that most PCI IDE card are using "siimage (CMD?),
HiPoint and IT8212 chip, are they working well with 2.6.x ?
Also, is the Intel ICH-5 SATA problem (somthing about interrupt) solved?
Thanks in advance, Please CC my email.
Kyle
