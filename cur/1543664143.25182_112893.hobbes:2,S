Subject: Enabling L2 cache for overdrive CPUs.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Some CPU overdrives (such as those made by powerleap) mean
that we get a CPU with L2 cache disabled by default, and
a BIOS that doesn't know how to turn it on.
The patch below is untested, and I'd like some feedback
from folks (preferably those with these wacky overdrives,
but also from regular intel CPUs too - disable L2 in your
bios and try booting with 'enable-l2' and see what happens).
