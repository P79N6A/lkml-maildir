Hehe.

Mostly because I think that idea sucks, and partly because I think your
ire is misdirected -- it shouldn't be directed at kernel code which
handles signals, but rather at kernel code which sleeps in state
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE but _doesn't_ handle signals.
On the other hand, if you ever find people actually trying to pass
_data_ to kernel threads with sys_rt_sigqueueinfo(), I'll be right
behind you with my own baseball bat waiting to bash the pieces you leave
behind :)
