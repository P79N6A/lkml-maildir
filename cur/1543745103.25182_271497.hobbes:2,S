How would we break userspace, when you can't do either thing today?
Just by adding one new feature, doesn't break anything :)
Anyway, I agree, but the core needs to have it's locking reworked in
order for this to work properly.  I'm working on this now.

Why?

No.  Consider the fact that the "unbind" file will not be present if the
device is not bound to anything.  Once it is bound, the unbind file will
be created, and the symlink will be created.  The symlink matches other
parts of sysfs.  By trying to put the name of the driver in a file, that
makes userspace work a lot harder to try to figure out exactly what
driver is bound (consider the fact that I can have both a pci and a usb
driver with the same name in sysfs, and that's legal.)
So, when a device is not bound to a driver, there will be no symlink, or
a "unbind" file, only a "bind" file.  Really there is only 1 "control"
type file present at any single point in time.
Sound good?
thanks,
