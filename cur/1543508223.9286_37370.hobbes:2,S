Has Linus actually declared a feature freeze yet? I know he said he
was going to, but if he actually has done so, I've seen nothing about
it yet.

My suggestion would be to have a directory in /proc (along the lines
of khttpd/mappings or similar) which allowed root to add symlinks to
it, such that `ls -l` would show something like the following if one
ignores the first few columns:
 Q> Default -> /home/httpd/html
 Q> www.memalpha.cx -> /home/memalpha/public_html
 Q> www.rhw.cx -> /home/rhw/public_html
Basically, the symlinks in that directory would be internally mapped
into a table of hostname/docroot pairs, and khttpd just refers to the
said table to sort virtual hosts out.
