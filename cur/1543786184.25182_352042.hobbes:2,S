Gene,
While kernel.org snapshots will no doubt be working again shortly, you
might want to consider using git.  It reduces the amount you have to
download for each release a lot.
It's really easy to grab a copy of git and use it to grab the kernel:
mkdir kernel
cd kernel
wget 
http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-core-0.99.7.tar.bz2
tar -xvjf git-core-0.99.7.tar.bz2
cd git-core-0.99.7
make install
cd ..
git clone \
rsync://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git \
linux
cd linux
git checkout
The above is given as an attachment as well because of annoying word wrap
issues with the long url's.   Anyway, after that you can stay current with
the latest Linus release with a simple  "git pull".
Cheers,
Sean
