How can a timer have a variable frequency and being used for
timing purposes. Maybe I just do not understand the point on TSC having a
fixed frequency (I certainly hope so but is that true in the power save
modes?).
True it is the applications problem if it breaks but we have applications
for SGI systems that demand access to a time source with the least
operating system interference possible.

Are you sure about that readability argument? A single
statement to calculate the delta is much more readable and verifyable
to be correct than a gazillion of small functions that (one  hopes and
prays) all do the same correctly.

Clarity is gained by centralizing these things. The design results in
numerous functions that are defined and which all mostly do the same. For
clarities sake please change the spec....

Performance as well as clarify as well as arch independence really
demand that these small functions be given up.

The reading from memory only works for well behaved time sources. If
something unusual comes along then a function needs to be called and thus
a performance hit is taken. If its important enough (like the drifty
logic on IA64) then one may consider putting that logic into the
generic code. I did not not say not to have functions at all. I think a
function call must be possible at least to retrieve the timer value for
special cases.
If the CPU freq cases is to be handled by the generic code or a special
function is a design decision that you probably have to make. Over time
other logic will develop that may first show up as new time retrieval
function but that is then recognized to be of universal importance so that
it will then be moved into the generic code.

Exactly.
