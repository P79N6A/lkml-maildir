Whoever sponsors the benchmark usually wins. Had you forgotten that
mongo setup used by 
http://www.namesys.com/benchmarks.html
 was specially
`tuned' to reach peak reiser4 performance? Remember why you decided to
turn OVERWRITE and MODIFY phases off? People on #reiser4 report 90
_second_ stalls with reiser4 under high io loads (large atom is
obviously being flushed and everyone waits on it...). In my opinion, it
is such things that are of utmost importance for real reiser4
acceptance, not how to name `metas' sub-directory.
Nikita.
