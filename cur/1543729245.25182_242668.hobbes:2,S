So what's the target in this process? Should users finally be able to
write cds again without or only with suid bit set? It would be good to
know if I should try to set all cd writing applications suid or just
have to wait for some patches coming up that would allow users to
write cds without suid again...
If the programs must be set suid, is that safe? In the past I was
always told that setting e.g. cdrecord suid was a possible security issue.
But I really don't understand enough of the new security model in the
kernel to judge if that's right or wrong...
Can someone enlighten me? :-)
cu,
Frank
