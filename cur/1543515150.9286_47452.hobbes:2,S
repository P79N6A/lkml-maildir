Subject: Patch: init's cwd is changed by modprobe!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Unlike most people (apparently) I have /var on a separate filesystem.
Recently I noticed that /var was still busy at shutdown.  I tracked
this problem down to the modprobe's filesystem context actually being
*shared* with init... and with a few kernel threads, too.  My modprobe
calls chdir("/var/log/ksymoops"), and when it does, init and the
kernel threads follow along.
If you have a modprobe that doesn't call chdir(), or if the chdir() is
to a directory on the root filesystem, you won't have noticed this
behavior.  If you're curious, just run "lsof" and look for the cwd of
init.  On my system, it was "/var/log/ksymoops".
The below patch fixes this bug by making modprobe's filesystem context
a *copy* of init's.  The patch is against 2.2.13, but I wouldn't be
surprised if 2.3 needs a similar fix.
