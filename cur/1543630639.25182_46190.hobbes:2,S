First you should look at www.suse.de/www.suse.com.
They have a very good support database:

As example for the German Telecom you need:
mtu 1492
mru 1492
It belongs into: /etc/ppp/peers/pppoe
#
# PPPoE options
#
plugin pppoe.so
#
# Plugin enables us to pipe the password to pppd, thus we don't have
# to put it into pap-secrets and chap-secrets. User is also passed
# on command line.
#
plugin passwordfd.so
#
noauth
usepeerdns
mru 1492
mtu 1492
# this is recommended
defaultroute
replacedefaultroute
hide-password
nodetach
# switch off all compressions (this is a must)
nopcomp
# this is recommended
novjccomp
noccp

pap-secret is empty autogenerate with YaST2 (SuSE 7.3)

Try with YaST/YaST2 (in this order).
Good luck.
