This issue is that when I try to use the BLKGETSZ64 ioctl from a user space
program, the version of linux/fs.h shipped with glibc-2.2.5 contains a
u64 type.  u64 is kernel-only, the correct type to be shared between
user and kernel space is either uint64_t (mandated by C9X) or the
__u64 type from asm/types.h.  Either way, u64 is wrong.
You could argue that this is a glibc bug.  But the way that glibc
generates the include/linux headers is just to copy them from some
kernel tree or other, with a little mangling on the side.

You are lost in a maze of BitKeeper repositories, all almost the same.
