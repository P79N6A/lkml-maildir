Thanks.  I tested the new sbf.c and after hacking it a
bit to remove the fail-on-invalid-reg-value, it runs:
root@thanatos:/home/jdthood/src/sbf# ./a.out
BOOT @ 0x07fd0040
CMOS register: 0x33
Read current value := 0x88
Read updated value := 0x89
Here it has set bit 0, the PnP-OS bit.  Do you have any
plans to enhance the program to allow control of all the flags?
