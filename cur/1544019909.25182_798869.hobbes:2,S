Ok, I ended up committing it.
I didn't do the whole "Cc: stable@kernel.org" thing, because maybe the 
non-cleanup version is less controversial for stable, but I decided that 
there's no way I don't want the cleanup done in mainline kernel, and if we 
end up needing a few VM_IO's added, I think it's worth it. Even after -rc3 
(since I suspend we won't actually need them).
