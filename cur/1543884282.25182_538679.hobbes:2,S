Can You send me documentation? I can't find anything in datasheet. 
I will replace bad resitors with correct ones.

No. It is much better. Much less packets need to be retransmitted.  
I was blaming w3cache.tkdami.net earlier.

With code commented out I have 1 error / 30000 transmitted packets from 
DP83815C. I have 1 error / 100000 transmitted packets to DP83815C. Maybe 
it works at all because I have short cable, only 10m long.
I don't remember any errors with plain 2.6.21.1.
