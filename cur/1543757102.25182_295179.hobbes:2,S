That does fix it for me, in 2.6.10-as3 (the -as3 patch doesn't touch anything
near the pty code, so it should be good for vanilla 2.6.10 too).
I noticed while testing that the "lost byte" is occasionally more than one
byte. It's always one byte at the 4k mark, but sometimes a larger group of
bytes is lost around the 8k mark, and (more rarely) an even larger group of
bytes is lost at the 12k mark.
