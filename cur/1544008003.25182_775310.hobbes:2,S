If there are some except for kvm that could use this, it should be
fine, I guess.
Can you add such information (e.g. who could use this) to the patch
description? It should be in the git log if the patch is merged.

Can you be more specific? What IOMMU could use this? For example, how
GART can use this? I think that people expect the name 'struct
iommu_ops' to be an abstract for all the IOMMUs (or the majority at
least). If this works like that, the name is a good choice, I think.
