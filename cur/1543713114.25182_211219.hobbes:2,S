Greets all;
The missus just asked me to scan something, but xsane locks up on the 
opening device scan.  I was booted to 2.6.5-rc3-mm4 at that time.
An lsusb went past the scanner, but hung at the end of the group of 
data from the mouse, a logitek optical wheel model thats working ok 
except for an occasional spastic jump halfway across the screen.
I am now rebooted to 2.6.5-rc3-mm3, and it appears everything is 
working ok, scanner included.
Here is where the lsusb died:
