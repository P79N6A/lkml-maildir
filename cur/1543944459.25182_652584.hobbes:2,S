If that API change doesn't conflict with the work that hundreds of other 
people do, it's obviously not a problem whichever way it goes.
And if the API change *does* cause conflicts, then yes, the onus of fixing 
those conflicts (again) goes to the person who changed the API. Everybody 
else did everything right.

You think that infrastructure is more important than outlying code. But 
you do that only because you write the infrastructure, not because you 
have any logical reason to think so.
The fact is, that "outlying code" is where we have all the bulk of the 
code, and it's also where we have all those developers who aren't on the 
"inside track". So we should help the outliers, not the core code. 
And very fundamentally, API changes are to be discouraged. If we make them 
harder to do and make people think twice (and occasionally say "not worth 
it"), that sounds like a damn good thing to me.
