Sigh, no, the repacker will probably be after 4.1....
The list of tasks for zam looks something like:
fix bugs that arise
debug read optimization code (CPU reduction only, has no effect on IO),
1 week est.  (would be nice if it was less)
review compression code 1 day per week until it ships.
fix fsync performance (est. 1 week of time to make post-commit writes
asynchronous, maybe 3 weeks to create fixed-reserve for write twice
blocks, and make all fsync blocks write twice)
write repacker (12 weeks).
I am not sure that putting the repacker after fsync is the right choice....
The task list for vs looks like:
* fix bugs as they arise.
* fix whatever lkml complains about that either seems reasonable, or
that akpm agrees with.
* Help edward get the compression plugins out the door.
* Improve fsck's time performance.
* Fix any V3 bugs that Chris and Jeff don't fix for us.  Which reminds
me, I need to check on whether the 90% full bug got fixed....
