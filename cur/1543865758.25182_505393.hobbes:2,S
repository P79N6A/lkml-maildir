From my end as an application developer, yes please. Either make it
perfectly ok to have thousands of outstanding asynchronous system calls (I
work with thousands of separate sockets), or allow me to select/poll/epoll
on the "async fd".
Alternatively, something like SIGIO ('SIGASYS'?) might be considered, but,
well, the fd might be easier.
In fact, perhaps the communication channel might simply *be* an fd. Queueing
up syscalls sounds remarkably like sending datagrams.
