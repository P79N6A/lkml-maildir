Subject: 2.2.1-7: Unable to print if printer in ON during boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The situation: If the printer (HP DeskJet 520) in ON during kernel
loading, the printing is impossible without some special means. If the
printer is OFF on Linux loading and is turned ON after that, everything
is OK.
Machine:
Pentium MMX 233/64M RAM
i430TX chipset
BIOS Parallel port settings: EPP1.9+SPP or EPP1.7+SPP.
I tried different combinations: parport_pc as module and builtin in the
kernel, the behavior is the same.  Printing is not possible, reason: Out
of paper.  If I turn the printer OFF and disconnect/reconnect the cable,
the problem disappears.  Finally I wrote small and ugly program which
cleares the port and resets the printer (attached below).  It cures the
problem, but I think that it would be better if something like this is
done in the parport_pc or lp driver.
Thanks.
