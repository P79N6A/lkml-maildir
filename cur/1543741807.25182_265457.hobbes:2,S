Well, if your target is Debian and Ubunto for starts, then you're discussing
this in the wrong mailing list.
BTW, on Debian/unstable:
root@Atlantis:/usr/src/linux# apt-cache search kernel-image | grep 2.6.8
kernel-image-2.6.8-1-386 - Linux kernel image for version 2.6.8 on 386.
kernel-image-2.6.8-1-686 - Linux kernel image for version 2.6.8 on PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/PIV.
kernel-image-2.6.8-1-686-smp - Linux kernel image for version 2.6.8 on PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/PIV SMP.
kernel-image-2.6.8-1-k7 - Linux kernel image for version 2.6.8 on AMD K7.
kernel-image-2.6.8-1-k7-smp - Linux kernel image for version 2.6.8 on AMD K7 SMP.
kernel-image-2.6.8-9-amd64-generic - Linux kernel image for version 2.6.8 on generic x86_64 systems
kernel-image-2.6.8-9-amd64-k8 - Linux kernel image for version 2.6.8 on AMD64 systems

kernel-image-2.6.8-9-em64t-p4-smp - Linux kernel image for version 2.6.8 on Intel EM64T SMP systems
kernel-tree-2.6.8 - Linux kernel tree for building prepackaged Debian kernel images
root@Atlantis:/usr/src/linux#
If you think the blockage is going to happen in 2.6.7, think twice.
