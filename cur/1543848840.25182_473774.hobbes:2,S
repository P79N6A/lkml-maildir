What is the purpose of
config SYSCTL_SYSCALL
	bool "Sysctl syscall support" if EMBEDDED
	default n
Allowing only embedded to turn this *on* ? Normally, you want
embedded to have more freedom in turning stuff off, so this
looks odd to me (and on one of my older boxes I definitely have
at least one OS-provided tool that uses this syscall, so I'd like
to be able to turn it on.
Thanks for an explanation,
Jan
