Subject: 2.6.2 ext3 loopback bug with data=journal
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've been getting an error message upon running e2fsck on a freshly-created 
ext3 loopback filesystem:
	Superblock has a bad ext3 journal (inode 8).
	Clear? yes
	*** ext3 journal has been deleted - filesystem is now ext2 only ***
How to reproduce the bug:
	# /tmp is on an ext3 filesystem mounted with data=journal
	# Create a 1 GiB (approx) empty file
	# (note that the bug still appears when using a non-sparse file)
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/dummyfs bs=1k count=1 seek=1M
	# Make the filesystem
	mke2fs -j -F /tmp/dummyfs
	# Check the filesystem.  This will find errors and delete the 
	# journal
	e2fsck -y /tmp/dummyfs
Things that cause the bug to *not* be reproduced:
	- mount /tmp with data=ordered instead of data=journal
	- create a 2GB ext2 loopback filesystem somewhere, and mount it 
	  over /tmp before executing the code above (i.e. put another 
	  filesystem layer in between mke2fs and the buggy ext3 filesystem)
I've included more verbose output below.
Also, I don't read linux-kernel much these days, so please Cc: me if you 
want me to reply.

Clear? yes
*** ext3 journal has been deleted - filesystem is now ext2 only ***
Superblock doesn't have has_journal flag, but has ext3 journal inode.
Clear? yes
/tmp/dummyfs was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.
