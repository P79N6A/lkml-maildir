True.  It's not what it's doing, though.  It looks for '\n' and ';'
characters, and counts the maximum instruction size for each possible
instruction.
The reason why is that gcc's size estimation is partially designed to
select what kind of branches it needs to use on architectures which have
more than one type of branches.  As a result, it tends to drastically
overestimate, on purpose.
