This is no fair answer, Pavel - I already invested my time to find a solution 
and only found BadRAM at that time. So my impression is that for memmap 
there's so little doc that no average user is able to use it. This will also 
prevent users from making "derived" documentation for other use-cases. And 
again we're back to the chicken-egg ??
You can have the "nicest" solution out there - as long as its 
either "nasty-to-use" or zero-documented, no one will really use it.

I did that and also read kernel-parameters.txt / memory.txt :
But there is _NO_ example line, just the synopsis. 
Do you expect all users to know what's e820 table is ? - this is not 
realistic. Not everybody is an expert in computer science.
Thats why BadRAM is used out there - memtest prints the values and BadRam can 
use them.
Lets try to get an example and document it:
My starting point would be: i wanna exclude this memory-area
badram=0x18690000,0xffff0000
(which means a whole from 0x18690000 to 0x1869ffff )
what would that be in memmap= -Syntax if i've got 2GB RAM in total ?
Best regards
