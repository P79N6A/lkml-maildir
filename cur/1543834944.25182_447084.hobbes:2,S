There is no bug.
What there is is an ill-defined set of rules.  If we want to tighten these
rules we have a choice between
a) Never enter page reclaim while holding i_mutex or
b) never take i_mutex on the page reclaim path.
Implementing a) would be a disaster.  It means that our main write()
implementation in mm/filemap.c (which holds i_mutex) wouldn't be able to
reclaim pages to satisfy the write.  And generally, we do want to use the
strongest memory allocation mode at all times.
So we'll have a better kernel if we implement b).
