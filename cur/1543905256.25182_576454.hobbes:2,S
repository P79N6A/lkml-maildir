Hmmm, that email would have taken how long? 5 minutes maybe?
I just feel that I would have written it if I happen to know that another 
developer spent lots of time and effort into a subsystem I plan to 
rewrite. Its just human logic to me. Especially when I happen to know 
that the other developer may be new to the kernel development process as 
I know it from a internal view point.
The current kernel development process tries to pretend that there is no 
human involvement. Which is plain inaccurate: It is *all* human 
involvement, without a human not a single bit of kernel code would 
change.
I always believed that kernel developers are human beings and no robots. 
And thus the kernel development process IMHO should be designed with 
human developers in mind instead of robots which take no offence out of 
anything. Otherwise things like what happened here will happen again and 
again and again and talent is lost.
It is damn good to take technical merits into full account! But ignoring 
human aspects of development actually will hinder this. Cause then in the 
end its not about technical merits anymore that do the decision, but that 
human aspects that have been ignored and are floating around 
unconsiously.
Actually I do believe that this discussion already took more resources 
than actually writing a few more mails and doing a bit more communication 
here and there... IMHO the fact that this discussion exists already shows 
that something in the process of submitting kernel patches and supporting 
involvement in kernel development can be improved upon.

I am not saying that developer B (Con) does not have his share in how it 
all happened. As written before I got the impression that Con reacted 
hurt where from my point of view no offence was meant - and I told him 
that. But from what I know it would have been possible to actually deal 
with that quite a bit better than has happened. And it would not have 
taken much effort. Well actually I think it would have been quite easy to 
take the talent that has offered itself.
