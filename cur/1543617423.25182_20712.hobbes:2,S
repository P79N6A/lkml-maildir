Where?
The main big thing in 2.5.3-pre1 is the IDE driver update, the rest looks
fairly simple. I've tested the new IDE driver on my system (the famous
"Works For Me" test), and it's been tested quite a lot in earlier
incarnations on other platforms, but there might easily be some BIO or
low-level IDE chipset interactions.
If it's not in the IDE driver, I'm at a loss.
