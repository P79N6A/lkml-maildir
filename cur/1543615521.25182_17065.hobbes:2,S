Isn't this why we use `unsigned long' to represent physical addresses, and
`void *' to represent kernel virtual addresses? Not only helps it against a
user dereferencing a physical address `pointer', but also against gcc trying to
be (too) smart.
Of course this also implies we have to change the pointer argument in readb()
and friends, since it's not a real pointer but a magic cookie. But we already
had that discussion last year...
[ and the conclusion was: keep the pointer, so we can do readl(&base->field) ]
