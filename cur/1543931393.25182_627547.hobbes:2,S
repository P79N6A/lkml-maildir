the problem is, this interface stores historic PIDs too - i.e. PIDs of 
tasks that might have exited already.
the proper way would be to also store the namespace address, and to 
filter out non-matching entries. (If leakage of this data across 
namespace creation is of any concern then flush out existing namespace 
data when a namespace is destroyed)
