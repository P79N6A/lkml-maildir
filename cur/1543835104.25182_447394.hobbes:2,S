Essentially, yes, but the differences are important.  It's important to
have a clear syscall interface instead of nesting through multiplexers.
 And we should get the batching/latency inputs right.  (I'm for both
min/max elements and arguably timeouts, but I could understand not
wanting to go *that* far.)

Yeah, it seems my description might not have sunk in :).  We're giving
userspace a way to collect events without performing a system call.

A few weeks! :)
