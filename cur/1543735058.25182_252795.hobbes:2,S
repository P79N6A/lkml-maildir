Behaviour is REQUIRED by POSIX and SuS.

     If the old argument and the new argument both refer to, and both
     link to the same existing file, rename() returns successfully and
     performs no other action.

So what you get is
	* after link(2) success - FOO and TEMP/BAR being links to the same
file.
	* after rename(2) (required) success - same as before
	* after unlink(2) - FOO is removed, TEMP/BAR remains.
