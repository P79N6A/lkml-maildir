Hi!
Got this in my logs earlier tonight:
Aug  8 23:39:30 narayan kernel: recvmsg bug: copied 0 seq 258EF 
There was no interesting context around that time.
This is on 2.2.10 SMP on a dual PII-450 system with 256 MiB RAM and
simple NE 2000 ISA NIC. If anybody is interested in further
information, please mail.
I have not noticed any problems, related or unrelated. I realize this
is not a very informative report, but that was all I got. Presumably
the relevant developer will know what it means :)
