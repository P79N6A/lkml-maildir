Not everyone that doesn't use BitKeeper is a luddite.  For instance,
Ben Collins has been explicitly prevented from using it simply because
he happens to work on Subversion.  His only option is to shell out
thousands for the commercial version.  It would serve everyone well to
remember that a minority of contributors to this list have the
financial resources to work around the onerous licensing terms of BK.
