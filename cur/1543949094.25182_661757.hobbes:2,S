Hmm. Personally, I don't see those as being a big issue, but they've been 
marked GPL-only for a long while. 
The thing is, I personally don't mind, and I think "derived code" is what 
matters, but others disagree, and quite frankly, I'm not going to force 
them - I have my _personal_ beliefs, but hey, others have theirs.
So you really need to talk to not me, but to the people who actually wrote 
and maintain that code. When they come back and say "yeah, we think 
ndiswrapper is a special case and we're ok with it", I'll happily either 
mark those things non-GPL or just mark ndiswrapper special in the module 
loader again.
Quite frankly, I don't care about ndiswrapper enough (at all) to push this 
along in the least.
