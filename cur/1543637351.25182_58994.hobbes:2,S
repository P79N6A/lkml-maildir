Yes, a number of drivers won't compile on SMP because they want the global
lock (that is gone). This includes the cmd640 IDE driver, and the parallel
port driver (and a largish number of others too, but I think those two are
the really common ones).
It should all work the same way it always did on UP, and hopefully the
straggling drivers will be converted to use local spinlocks soon (and in
some cases the global irq lock might not even be needed at all)
