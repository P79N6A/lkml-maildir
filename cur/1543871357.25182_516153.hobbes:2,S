I don't share your fear when it comes to Xen.
The Xen ABI did involve too, there are a few hypercalls with old and new
versions, just like different linux syscall versions exist.  Guests then
can choose to either fallback to the slow, old version in case the new
hypercall returns -ENOSYS or raise the minimum required xen version to
the one with the new hypercall and leave out the legacy cruft.
The current xen hypercall ABI isn't set in stone, it can and will evolve
too ...

I don't expect that being a problem with Xen.

See above, that path exists with Xen too.
cheers,
