You probably _do_ want readahead for these, if they're of any
significant size, so that the application doesn't block on reading.
The existing cacheing strategies are probably fine for config files read
once, too.  If not, I suggest a two-level cache status, like the old
directory name cache.

A good read-ahead implementation will catch on to this very quickly by
itself.  Discarding the pages immediately after use is trickier...  Then
again, how can an app be absolutely sure you're not about to stop it and
restart it again at the beginning?

We already have write-behind and read-ahead.  I'm not sure how clever
file write clustering is yet.

Again, readahead is pretty good; perhaps it could be improved.
I see no need to tell the kernel about something it could recognise itself.

There's no advantage in reading ahead further than is required to avoid
blocking the read() calls, for most of the calls.  It would be a waste
of memory.
The kernel ought to have a self-tuning algorithm to do this kind of
read-ahead.  I don't know if it does for read() yet.  I do know it
doesn't do mmap() read-ahead, and the suggested algorithms for this
should be very good.

Both the application and the kernel can guess at this, but neither can
be sure in most cases.  No media streaming program can be sure you don't
want to use the data again, though you might trust the hint a bit more.
My feeling is the kernel can guess this stuff very well, though maybe it
isn't that refined yet.

I don't agree that discarding data one app predicts won't be required is
the right thing.  However, discarding it _in preference_ to other data
read by the same app. would make sense.

Good read-ahead will manage these nicely after it's got the hang of it.
For cases where you want to open and then read lots of files, you'll get
better results by making your application multi-threaded instead.
Perhaps there is a case for background read-ahead-when-device-idle of
newly opened files.

This is yet more read ahead, which read() should handle fine once it has
caught on.  (The read ahead algorithms may need a little refinement).
You suggestions only save time between open() and read() if the
application does other things in between.  IMO, that is quite unusual:
most apps. just open() then read() immediately.  The others, could do
their thing using a thread to stimulate read ahead.

We know.  However it's not clear if this is efficient in conjunction
with user-space MMU mappings and the standard socket API.  Remapping
pages has its own overheads, and is not well suited to the usual
read()/write()/recv()/send(), unless everything is page aligned and page
sized.  Receiving is particularly problematic.
On the bright side, zero-copy TCP/IP is already available in the kernel
itself.  If you have one of those embedded applications, you can run it
in kernel mode.
