Hi folks,
There is a slight #include problem introduced by 2.2.0-pre8. The include file
asm-i386/semaphore.h uses as of this version the symbol PAGE_MASK, but does
not include anything to define it. It should probably include <asm/page.h>.
If anybody has a suggestion to which maintainer this report  should be sent,
please tell me.
Keep up the good work,
  Frodo
