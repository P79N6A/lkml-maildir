Hi,
Have anybody tried to install Linux (redhat or slackware) kernel 2.2.0
and
above on a machine with aic 7880 Ultra scsi adapter?. I've tried both
redhat 6.0
and slackware 4.0 and on both occasion, the kernel crashed with a GPF
error.
After trying for several time and using several boot images, I've still
got the
same error so i tried slackware 3.5 with kernel 2.0.34 and it works.
Then I compile a new kernel ( 2.0.37 pre something , comes with
slackware 3.9)
and again it crashed when i tried to boot. Same goes to kernel 2.0.36
but I didn't try 2.0.35.
The machine is a primergy 060 , with a pentium pro processor, aic7880
scsi
adapter and 4gb western digital scsi hard disk, now running with kernel
2.0.34.
