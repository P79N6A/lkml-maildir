Hi Oleg,
   Thanks for the cc: Vitaliy, I never saw that patch.  I've included it in my queue now.
As to this patch, it seems marginal.  I've never been convinced that we should
be trying to rescue root if they choose to set kthreadd's prio anyway, but I'm also wondering why we care about kthread_create scalability!
Still, I'm happy to apply it with one change:

cpu_all_mask is the non-deprecated replacement for CPU_MASK_ALL_PTR.
Thanks!
Rusty.
