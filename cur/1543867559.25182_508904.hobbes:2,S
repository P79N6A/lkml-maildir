Im trying to port some drivers between 2.6.14 and 2.6.19
I find that irqdesc has changed completely. how do i port
the drivers between 2.6.14 and 2.6.19?
is there a porting guide available to port the drivers
which use irqdesc?.
my drivers use variables triggered, ... which dont exist in 2.6.19
irqdesc strcuture.
Could anyone help me on this.
Regards,
Jo
