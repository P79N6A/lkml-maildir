Another option is to have cpusets or cpu isolation tree that I've started 
already. I was saying from the very beginning cpu isolation stuff does not 
imho belong in the scheduler tree. Besides a tiny patch to the sched.c that 
adds/removes the bitmaps there are no scheduler changes needed for this 
specifically.
Peter, Ingo, if you guys are ok with this lets just have this stuff in 
cpuisol-2.6.git. I'm anyway rebasing it ontop of Peter's work. Of course we'll 
go through regular review and stuff and Andrew can track that tree separately.
Just a suggestion. I'm ok with submitting patches via sched-devel. Separate 
tree seems more appropriate though.
