Was this after an unclean reboot?  It looks increasingly as if a lot of
current PC systems have a problem with trashing random disk blocks if
the system powerfails mid-write.  That would explain bad block accesses
on the root device, but other devices should have been fscked cleanly
before they'd get this sort of error.
Can you isolate the problem to a specific kernel version, or does this
seem to be a generic problem?
