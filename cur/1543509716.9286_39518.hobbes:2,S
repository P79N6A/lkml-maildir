No, I really don't know what other Unixen do. SO_REUSEADDR seems to
indicate that you're willing to allow another local user of the port.
On the other hand, if I request a ephemeral port, I expect to get a
useable port from the system (usually for OUTGOING connections), which
is useable for the purpose I intended. So if "servers" keep getting
bigger and bigger, as they are now, we're going to see departemental
servers having tens of thousands outgoing connections in the near
future. If we require "SO_REUSEADDR" in that case before we give a
port number out a second time, we'd need to modify all applications.
I think maybe we should think about what the best way is to outgrow
this 16 bit portnumber restriction. If we have to force applications
to set SO_REUSEADDR on ephemeral ports, we might start warning
application-authors now. (All applications except ftpd want this!)

You reserve it by allocating it...

Either run your server from inittab, so that it gets restarted really
quickly, or write a shadow deamon that just allocates the port with
SO_REUSEADDR set, so that the real deamon (whcih you say occasionally
dies) can bind to the same port afterwards.
