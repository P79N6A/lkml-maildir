Well, I've just had the machine crash another two times, the first time I 
thought it might have been a different bug, but looking back it was the 
same issue.  This time the lockup happened during an ssh session in an 
xterm under X - ie. no disk access, no strace/ptrace.  Again it happened 
during screen update (half a character line on screen, the other half 
still containing the old chars) - obviously this is an Xserver 
Cyber9525DVD issue.  It would seem though that strace and ide access 
greatly increase the probability of a hang happening.  I'm wondering if 
there is any way to get the Xserver running without iopl(3) but using 
ioperm instead - I know that the io bitmap is only 0x400 ports, could this 
possibly be changed to encompass all 0x10000 ports and then redirect 
iopl(n) to ioperm(0,0x10000,n==3), plus patch sigsegv handler to ignore 
cli/sti, thus forcing interrupts to always remain enabled.  Cause that's 
where the problem seems to live.  This would probably allow at least a 
trace via serial console, etc...
Any ideas on how to trace this down (no nmi watchdog available)?
Cheers,
MaZe.
