What you need to have such a library at user-level is access to many
internals of the library.  But this is not possible if one wants to
have stability.  For this reason the internals are not accessible.  It
is simply impossible to develop something if there is code which
depends on the exact behaviour of certain internal functions.  One
cannot remove them, one cannot change them.  Effectively this means no
further development.
Once there *is* no further development you can think about loosing
these rules but even then it's too dangerious since you never can be
sure there are no further changes required.
