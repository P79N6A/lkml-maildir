Hello Andrew,
I am including 2nd version of the patch, slightly modified according
to your comments. See inline my response:

Ok, done in repost.

Agreed and removed :).

Well I am not sure, what is exactly against coding practices (this is
my first patch, so bear with me). Was it the comment? Or the "likely".
But, anyway, I guess I was a bit paranoic. chip->release is set to 
original device::release and this should be set to platform_device_release
at least (and if someone messed with it, it should not be NULL anyway).
So I removed complete condition.

The first condition is needed, since the vendor does not have to
define release function for its own purpose. In fact, for example
current TIS driver does not even know about it.

Subject: [PATCH] TPM: fix for segfault in device removal
The clean up procedure now uses platform device "release" callback to
handle memory clean up.  For this purpose "release" function callback was
added to struct tpm_vendor_specific, so hw device driver provider can get
called when it is safe to remove all allocated resources.
This is supposed to fix a bug in device removal, where device while in
receive function (waiting on timeout) was prone to segfault, if the
tpm_chip struct was unallocated before the timeout expired (in
tpm_remove_hardware).
