I'm trying to track down a specific detail about how Linux handles circular
link
references.  I know that certain system calls will return [-]ELOOP when this
condition is detected, but I need a little more information:
I've seen descriptions that say only a certain number of links will be
followed
before Linux will assume it has a circular reference and give up and
return ELOOP.  Is this true?  If so, what's the limit?  Is the limit hard-
coded, or can it be overridden programmatically?
I found in the Linux source browser one spot that returns ELOOP, at
http://metalab.unc.edu/navigator-bin/navigator.cgi?fs/ext2/symlink.c,
 in
function ext2_follow_link.  This seems to indicate pretty clearly that the
count
is hardwired to 5, at least for ext2.  Is this correct?  Has it always been
5?
Since I need this information for a technical edit of a published article,
and I'm on a very tight deadline, I would appreciate replies directly to
my e-mail address, lgrinzo@stny.lrun.com, if possible.
Thanks in advance.
Lou
