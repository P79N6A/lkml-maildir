Subject: [RFC][PATCH] PM: Acquire device locks on suspend (rev. 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/6/298

Hi,
The patch below is intended as a replacement for
gregkh-driver-pm-acquire-device-locks-prior-to-suspending.patch that deadlocked
suspend and hibernation on some systems.  The present patch contains some
safeguards against deadlocks in that cases and a mechanism to print warnings
if a deadlock is probable.
I've tested it a little, but the error paths are generally untested.
Please review.
Thanks,
Rafael

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>, Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
This patch reorganizes the way suspend and resume notifications are
sent to drivers.  The major changes are that now the PM core acquires
every device semaphore before calling the methods, and calls to
device_add() during suspends will fail, while calls to device_del()
during suspends will block.
It also provides a way to safely remove a suspended device with the
help of the PM core, by using the destroy_suspended_device() callback
introduced specifically for this purpose, and updates two drivers (msr
and cpuid) that need to use it.
Signed-off-by: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
