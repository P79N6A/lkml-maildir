Actually that shouldn't be necessary. Look at my arch-x86-64 patch or
vsyscall-i386 patch for how the arch_vsyscall_gtod_update() function is
used. It provides an arch specific hook called by the timeofday core to
provide the information you desire. 
Please let me know if it is not sufficient for some reason.

Just to clarify for others, this is the same unsynced cpu cycle counter
problem that affects the TSC on i386 and x86-64. ia64 gets around the
problem by checking on every call to gettimeofday() if the ITC value is
less then the ITC value used on the previous call to gettimeofday(). If
the value is less (ie: would result in time going backwards) it just
uses the last value to calculate time. It then uses cmpxchg to
atomically update the last ITC value. 
The problem I have with this is it that if the ITCs are not synced, they
really are not good timesources. If one cpu's ITC is behind another, the
net result of the above algorithm is cpu 2 will always just use cpu 1's
last calculated time. This could cause jumps in time when a process
moves from cpu2 to cpu1.
Since it only affects the TSC and ITC, I think keeping the decision to
use cmpxchg in the timesource code, as you've implemented with the ITC
is the best way to go. If you really want to you can special case the
arch specific fsyscall code by switching on the time source .name, and
that would allow you to use a similar cmpxchg algorithm there as well. 
thanks
