Luck!  Fwiw, I was unable to reproduce the problem at all even on 2.2.0
with your test script.

No spinlock change will fix this race (although the memcpy will).

OK.

No, because the fork/exec race is still obviously present in get_stat,
and because SMP-only synchronisation fixes cannot fix a problem seen on
UP machines.

Any modifications or blocking lookups to the mmap structures, and all
places where we add a new page into the process page tables.  That
includes mmap operations and page faults.

Not at all.  The whole point of the semaphore is to protect the shared
mm when we have multiple threads all mmaping and page faulting
independently within the same mm_struct.  That's why the semaphore is in
the mm_struct, not in the task_struct.

Yes.  Basically, changing an existing pte needs the kernel lock.  Adding
or modifying (but not removing) a new pte or modifying the vma tree
needs the mm semaphore.  We can unmap ptes in swap_out() without the
semaphore but with only the kernel lock.  We can map new anonymous pages
without the kernel lock but with only the semaphore.  Everything else
needs both.
