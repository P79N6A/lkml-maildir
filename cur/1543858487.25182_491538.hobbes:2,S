All comments are welcome, thanks for the revision. :)

The code was based on code presents at security/keys/user_defined.c. This is the reason of why the MMC PWD code was
implemented using this returns types and others implementations.
That file (user_defined.c) implements generic functions to handle keys inside the kernel, using the Kernel Key Retention
Service. Maybe you can take a look there, :).
That zap variable was used to expand the key payload when a new password exceeded a previous configured size. But the
Kernel Key Retention Service has changed and that zap variable is not used on key_instantiate function implemented at
user_defined.c, anymore. I'll update the MMC PWD code.

See the reply above.

data = 0 is different from !data.

Reply above.

Yes. I believe sizeof is a compiler operation and it does not access the data pointed by that pointer, it access just
the type of the pointer.
Wouldn't it be safer to use

I believe there is no difference on using this one and that other declaration.
