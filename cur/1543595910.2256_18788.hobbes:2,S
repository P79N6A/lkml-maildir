Hello Alan,
I mount my bootdisk (minix filesystem) with "mount /dev/fd0 /mnt" and copy my 
new compiled kernel to it. After that I do a "lilo -v -C /mnt/lilo.conf".
All following commands which are floppy related (filesystem) fall into the D 
state. Load goes up by 100 for every D state process.
ls /mnt
umount /mnt
sync
SunWave1#ps aux
root      1039  0.0  0.0  1404   64 pts/1    D    16:24   0:00 umount /mnt
nuetzel   1108  0.1  0.1  1412  500 pts/5    D    16:28   0:00 sync
Only the floppy (Minix) show this symptoms.
All other disk partitions (ReiserFS) working (mount/umount) as expected.
Thanks,
        Dieter
