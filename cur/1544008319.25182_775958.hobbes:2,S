Subject: [PATCH] ath9k: correct expected max RX buffer size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We should only tell the hardware its capable of DMA'ing
to us only what we asked dev_alloc_skb(). Prior to this
it is possible a large RX'd frame could have corrupted
DMA data but for us but we were saved only because we
were previously also pci_map_single()'ing the same large
value. The issue prior to this though was we were unmapping
a smaller amount which the prior DMA patch fixed.
