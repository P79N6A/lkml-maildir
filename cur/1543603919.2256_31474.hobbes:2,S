drivers/scsi/sg.c:319 (sg_open) (2.4.10-ac4) reads:
    if (flags & O_EXCL) sdp->exclude = 0; /* undo if error */
but this variable is linked to a waitlist. Should this not read thus?
    if (flags & O_EXCL) {
        sdp->exclude = 0;
        wake_up_interruptible(&sdp->o_excl_wait);
    }
It reads this way in sg_release.
