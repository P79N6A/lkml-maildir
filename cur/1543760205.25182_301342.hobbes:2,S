Not that I know. For adv7175 it couldn't be reported so far anyway
because people would hit the oops in saa7110 before (same board: DC10+,
oops fixed in a different patch).
It is possible that people are able to get their board to still work
without my patch, if the chips were properly configured in the first
place and they don't attempt to reconfigure them (like norm change). I
don't know the chips well enough to tell how probable this is.
Thanks,
