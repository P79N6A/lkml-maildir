the bug is the following: the 2.5.3-pre2 kernel in essence includes the
-I3 patch. The -I3 scheduler doesnt have the task migration fixes yet, but
has the improved load-balancer. And exactly this improved load-balancer
makes task-migration much more likely to happen during bootup =>
triggering it for ksoftirqd migration, resulting in a hang.
older versions had the migration bug as well, but the first iteration of
the load-balancer was much less accurate at balancing runqueues, so it
didnt trigger the bug.
