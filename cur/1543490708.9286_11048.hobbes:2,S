I posted it already:
: # -*-Perl-*-
eval 'exec perl -w -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
        if 0;
And this also works:
#!/usr/bin/env perl
if you want that -w thing you can add a second line if you're using perl5:
BEGIN { $^W = 1; }

(I think the point must be that it should be portable, a linux-only solution 
just don't cut it.  The above tricks work fine, so why don't we just forget 
about clever new Linux-only hacks?  I'm not going to post more on this issue 
anyway.)
