So this is a hole in the emulation.

No. Well, the translator would change. The old i386
binaries would not.
ELF notes are supplied by the kernel. They provide
data like USER_HZ, the UID, a flag to indicate that
ld.so must take setuid-type precautions, and so on.
ELF notes are on the stack, beyond the environment.

No. I mean enhancing sys_prctl to allow asking for
the file descriptor number. That way, argv doesn't
need to get mangled in the first place.
I'm sure there are many other good ways to pass the
file descriptor number to the interpreter.
