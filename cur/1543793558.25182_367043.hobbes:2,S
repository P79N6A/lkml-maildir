And even then there is no guarantee there isn't something somewhere
converting the 64-bit to pairs of 32-bit accesses. Thus one would in
fact need extra information about the platform to know whether the
entire bus path is 64-bit in order to safely do 64-bit accesses.
However, the changes as I proposed them (and will resubmit hopefully
later today with the adjustments requested by Andi) do intentionally not
do any 64-bit reads, they only use 64-bit writes when resetting counter
or comparator (where all that's needed from the platform is that the
writes to the low 32 bits are done first, which x86 architecturally
guarantees).
