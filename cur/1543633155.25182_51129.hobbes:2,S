Outside of the specific changes suggested by Chris, I can see a
requirement to be able to detect poor connections. While TCP/IP may
not drop packets from the perspective of user space applications,
TCP/IP packets do get lost. For certain applications that require high
bandwidth, or low latency, applications may be able to optimize code
paths by analyzing statistics related to the socket.
Datagram sockets are more straight forward to implement this for, but
that does not mean that TCP/IP does not have similar potential.
I am not certain what the exact requirement is for in Chris' cases,
but I do know that in his field, he is writing something far more
complicated and resource intensive than a telnet server.
