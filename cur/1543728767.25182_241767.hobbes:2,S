Personally I know it's in use, but for some programs it's a fallback if 
SG_IO or a more modern method doesn't work...
Since we have (AFAICS) five interfaces (scsi-send-command, sg v1, sg v2, 
sg v3, and SG_IO) I would rather just go ahead and
static int printed_warning;
if (!printed_warning++)
	printk(KERN_WARNING "SCSI_SEND_COMMAND deprecated\n");
Also, inevitably some of the programs using this will be ancient disk 
tools (some written by disk vendors long gone)...
