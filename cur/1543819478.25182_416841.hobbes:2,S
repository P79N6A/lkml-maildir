I'm imagining that the resultant modinfo output can be used by a tool
for anyone to package up the correct firmware to go with a given
driver. Right now, there's no way to do that - i.e. we've gone
backwards from a standpoint of coupling a kernel with firmware. I
completely understand why firmware doesn't really belong in the
kernel, so let's add this :-)

That kind of thing. It's not just Red Hat who benefit - anyone who
wants to package up a kernel and do something with it will want to
know about firmware they might need. Including everything in
/lib/firmware "just in case" is as ugly as having userspace tools with
duplicated logic that need to understand about the internals of a
driver module.
