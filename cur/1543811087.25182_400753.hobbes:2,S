Jeff G. added an "msi" option to the sata_mv driver recently.
But yes, I expect it to be more of a platform issue than a
driver issue.
s2io network people report MSI interrupt problems on various
platforms (on netdev mailing list).
There are other reports (that I have at home, not visible to me
now).  It would be good to have an MSI expert around.
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/patches/pci_nomsi.patch
 adds a
global boot option to disable MSI interrupt assignments.
