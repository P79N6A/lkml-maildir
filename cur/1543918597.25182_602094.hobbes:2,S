I would agree.  The 64 bit fileids will only become visible when
the server is exporting file systems which contain fileids which
are bigger than 32 bits and then only when the application
encounters these files.
Also, these 32-bit legacy applications are going to have a
problem if they are ever run on a system which contains local
file systems which expose the large fileids.
It would be better to identify these applications and get them
fixed.  The world is evolving and it is time for them to do so.
