Subject: linux-2.4.11-pre4/drivers/mtd/bootldr.c does not compile

	Attempting to compile linux-2.4.11-pre4/drivers/mtd/bootldr.c
fails with a bunch of compiler errors, including a complaint that
"struct tag" is not defined anywhere.  Presumably this is the result
of an incompletely applied patch.
	Reverting drivers/mtd/bootldr.c to the linux-2.4.11-pre3
version makes it compile without problems.
