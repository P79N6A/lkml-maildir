We would need to change man pages for that, and this IMHO w/out a strong 
reason of doing so.

No need thx. I'll be sending the one-liner to the list right now.

I'm afraid you need to bug the glibc guys, since I think they wrap 
sys_poll(). Try the test program below, when defining _X_, that makes it 
call sys_poll() directly. It will have the same epoll_wait() behaviour.
