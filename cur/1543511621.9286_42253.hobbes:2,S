sys_open, sys_close, and the *stat system calls can hold the kernel lock
for a long time.  i believe that adding separate locking for the dentry
cache and cleaning up locking in the file system will help this.  is
anyone working on these projects?  will this work appear in 2.4, or is it
a 2.5 project?  thanks for any info.
