I have a system with 2GB of memory. One of my processes calls mmap to try to
map a 100MB file into memory. This calls fails with -ENOMEM. I rebuilt the
kernel with a few debug printk statements in mmap.c to see where the failure
was occurring it occurred in the function arch_get_unmapped_area. the code
is as follows:
for (vma = find_vma(mm, addr); ; vma = vma->vm_next) {
		/* At this point:  (!vma || addr < vma->vm_end). */
		unsigned long __heap_stack_gap;
		if (TASK_SIZE - len < addr)
                { 
                        printk("%d TASK SIZE - LEN LESS THAN
ADDR\n",__LINE__);
			return -ENOMEM;
                } 
		if (!found_hole && (!vma || addr < vma->vm_start)) {
			mm->free_area_cache = addr;
			found_hole = 1;
		}
		if (!vma)
			return addr;
		__heap_stack_gap = 0;
		if (vma->vm_flags & VM_GROWSDOWN)
			__heap_stack_gap = heap_stack_gap << PAGE_SHIFT;
		if (addr + len + __heap_stack_gap <= vma->vm_start)
			return addr;
		addr = vma->vm_end;
	}
The printk is mine. What exactly is meant by the fact that TASK_SIZE - len <
addr?
