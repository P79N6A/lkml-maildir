The reason is that HPA, who did the recent IA32 CPU detection cleanup,
felt that the information reported in the new 'features' field was
sufficiently different from that reported in the old 'flags' field that
it was worth renaming -- so that programs wouldn't try to rely on the
old flag names.
(Specifically: some flags were renamed to be distinct between Intel,
AMD, etc, because the exact behavior of the flag may vary between
brands.)

This patch is already in test12pre5, and is wrong.  You need two tabs
after 'flags'.
