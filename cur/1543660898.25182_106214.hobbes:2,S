Don't confuse sendfile with zerocopy. You generally need to use
sendfile to take advantage of zerocopy, but you can still get
advantages from sendfile without having hardware support, mainly in
terms of reducing syscall overhead. And without sendfile, you can
still get performance benefits from zerocopy..

Sendfile is mostly used by webservers. You can check the Samba
changelogs for when they started using sendfile. And 2.4 NFS doesn't
use zerocopy, AFAIK.
