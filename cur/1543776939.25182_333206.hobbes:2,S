Ordinarily I'd agree.  But this is a bit like kprobes - it's a funny thing
which other kernel features rely upon, but those features are often ad-hoc
and aren't intended for merging.
relayfs is more for in-kernel "applications" than for userspace ones, if
you like.
Still, first let us get a handle on who wants relayfs now and in the future
and for what.  Then we can better decide.
