No, there isn't.  Ani volunteered for the position, then has been
ignoring patches sent to him for a year or more.   I used to be rivafb
maintainer (look at who wrote riva/fbdev.c...), then didn't have time. 
When I asked around for a new maintainer, he claimed to take up the
position, but no patches have been forthcoming...
Ferenc Bakonyi did a good bit of work, and IMO would be a good candidate
for maintainership, if he's still around.

P.S. Not to knock Ani Joshi himself -- I have many cheers for him, he
got my S3 cards working under XFree 4.0!
