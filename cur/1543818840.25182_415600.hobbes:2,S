Hello!
I have a computer with motherboard VIA EPIA-V.
(
http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/mini_itx/epia_v/
)
I've compiled kernel for it but it doesn't work. It doesn't shows any 
error but stopped with:
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 136k freed.
Executing init=/sbin/init
Then there are no any other messages. Computer is alive (keyboard input 
is worked).
Please help me.
