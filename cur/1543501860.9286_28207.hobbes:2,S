LDAP is becoming the directory access mechanism adopted by
large enterprises for user registration.  So LDAP support in
the Linux kernel allows people to log into Linux machines with
the same userid, password, etc that they use for dial-in, web
server access, mainframe use, etc.  Common corporate LDAP
systems come from Netscape and Novell, but there is a wide
variety of offerings.
There is an LDAP Pluggable Authentication Module for Linux
at:
  
http://www.padl.com/
that adds LDAP support to the Linux kernel for user
authentication and, optionally, registration.
Usual caveats about Linux's 16-bit numeric UIDs exacerbating
the hell of aligning multiple manufacturers `reserved' UID/GID
ranges apply.
