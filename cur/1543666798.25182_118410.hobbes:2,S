It seems to work with this one:
02:03.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev
02)
        Subsystem: IBM 82558B Ethernet Pro 10/100
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop-
ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort-
<TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 32 (2000ns min, 14000ns max)
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 16
        Region 0: Memory at e0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Region 1: I/O ports at a400 [size=32]
        Region 2: Memory at df000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
[size=1M]
        Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=1M]
No problem with more than 10^7 packets
It just drops packets under heavy load, without live-locking, 
so NAPI kinda works :)
Unfortunally, I could not get this NIC to work with oversized frames
to implement 802.1q, both with eepro100 and e100 drivers :(
:wq
                                        With best regards, 
                                           Vladimir Savkin.
