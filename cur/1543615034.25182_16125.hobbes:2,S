You're right - I've just done a "make bzImage" on the same .config
file and the resulting kernel boots fine on my Tecra!
I'm a happy bunny now because I can just use bzImage for all my
systems.
So it looks like the Tecra A20 problem was worked around some
time ago, it's just that I remember the days when it wasn't and had
learnt the zImage workaround.
Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.  I really don't know why
I didn't just try bzImage before.
Although the Tecra problem has been solved, the zImage bug remains,
although I'm not concerned about it now that I can use bzImage.
