C99:
"All identifiers that begin with an underscore and either an uppercase
letter or another underscore are always reserved for any use."
That applies to normal userspace programs.  It allows compiler, libc
and possibly the kernel to introduce new identifiers without breaking
existing programs.  If programs break, it is their fault, they
shouldn't have used such identifiers.
The kernel is quite different.  Basically, all identifiers belong to
the kernel, none to libc/gcc (with very few exceptions).  So
developers are free to use that at their pleasure and most stick to
your description in the first paragraph.
