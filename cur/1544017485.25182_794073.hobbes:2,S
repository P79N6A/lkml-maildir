Good point, but it indicates that the function does not have a caller
within kernel tree.
Ok, there could be other clients.  So this patch might just be a hint
for the original author or maintainer that there is maybe no need to
export this function.

Right, that's why I have made it static and removed the EXPORT_SYMBOL,
all under the assumption that there is _no_ client for this function,
but there may be some outside the kernel tree.  I can not judge this.
