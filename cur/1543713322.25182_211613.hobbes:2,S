Instead of splitting one kmalloc in two, it would also be possible to
add a "struct i2c_client client" field to each of the *_data
structures - the compiler should align all fields appropriately.
Probably this way will result in less changes to the code (and also
less labels and less error paths).
Example patch for lm75 (untested):
