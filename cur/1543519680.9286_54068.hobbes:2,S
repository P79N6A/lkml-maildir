Except I called set_blocksize(dev, 512) prior to attempting the I/O
operation, and the driver failed to change the blocksize from 1024 byte
blocks to 512 byte blocks.  I discovered that the if i do this after
loading the driver in the moules MST file, for whatever reason, the
blocksize function call gets ignored (???).  Technically, since I called
this function, it wasn't off the end, but the driver thought it was.  
I've coded around it so it's not affecting us anymore, but it might be
interesting to determine why the IDE driver is doing this.....
