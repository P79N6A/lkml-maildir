My mistake: calc_vm_prot_bits() is actually in include/linux/mman.h
(which you are already #including, so no problem).

Thanks.  By the way, I hope you noticed that some architectures
(arm, m68k, sparc, sparc64) may adjust protection_map[] at startup:
so the old agp_convert_mmap_flags would supply the compiled in prot,
whereas the new agp_convert_mmap_flags supplies the adjusted prot.
I assume this is either irrelevant to you (no AGP on some arches?)
or an improvement (the adjusted prot more appropriate); but if you
weren't aware of it, please do check that those do what you want.
Hugh
