Subject: why does radeonfb work fine in 2.6, but not in 2.4.29-pre1?

The same radeonfb-setup works fine in every 2.6 kernel I can remember
(last tested with 2.6.10-rc2-mm3) but give the dreaded 'cannot map FB'
in 2.4.29-pre1.
The card has 128 Mb of ram, and my system has 3 Mb of RAM.
Is there any reason the ioremap() call works on 2.6, but doesn't on 2.4?
I've tried searching google for hints, but nothing has turned up.
Is there any way to test 2.4 with my radeonfb and all of my memory?
Thanks,
Jurriaan
