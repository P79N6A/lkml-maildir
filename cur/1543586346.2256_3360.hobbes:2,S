Subject: 2.4.3 compile fail (conflicting types) - Alpha processor - init/main.c

I didn't turn up a previous reference to this with a quick search in the
mailing list archive, so here it goes.
Compiling 2.4.3 on an Alpha processor system failed on 'init/main.c' with
'conflicting types' errors for 'pte_alloc' and 'pmd_alloc'.  If I'm reading
things right, it's a discrepency between 'include/asm/pgalloc.h' and
'include/linux/mm.h'.
