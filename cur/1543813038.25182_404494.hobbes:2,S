It's (should be: it was) worse than that. Under Win98 (Common Platform For
Binary Drivers), you had to install a usbdisk driver for every usb product
class, i.e. Samsung only provides a mass storage driver for Samsung, SONY only
for SONY drives, etc. Luckily this is a little relieved in Win2000 (CPFBD too)
where there is a generic usbdisk driver à la usb_storage.ko, which reads 
more than just from one vendor.
