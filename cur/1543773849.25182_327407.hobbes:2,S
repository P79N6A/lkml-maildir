Just a quick update: With a bit of quick optimizing the current design,
removing most of the 64bit math from the gettimeofday fast path, I've
managed to cut it down to within 2% of the current code using the c3tsc
vs tsc. The c3tsc timesource adds a bit of overhead that the mainline
code doesn't do, so I'm going to see how a more comparable TSC vs TSC
test goes.
