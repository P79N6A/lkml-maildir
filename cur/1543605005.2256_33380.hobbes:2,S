Works here on the inspiron 5k. Parport detects its config correctly, even 
after multiple loads/unloads, lspnp and setpnp seem to be doing the right 
thing, parport detects the new parameters after changing them with setpnp.
Relevant dmesg output:
PnPBIOS: Found PnP BIOS installation structure at 0xc00f7230.
PnPBIOS: PnP BIOS version 1.0, entry 0xf0000:0xa610, dseg 0x400.
