Subject: [PATCH] xen: don't bother trying to set cr4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/12/336

Xen ignores all updates to cr4, and some versions will kill the domain
if you try to change its value.  Just ignore all changes.
