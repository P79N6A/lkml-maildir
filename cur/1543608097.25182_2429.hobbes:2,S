Sorry, I forgot to set INITIAL_JIFFIES to zero before posting the patch.
Testing with high INITIAL_JIFFIES values unfortunately still discloses
instability after the wraparound even for an otherwise unpatched kernel.
I also forgot to mention that the introduced jiffies_high variable is
useless on 64 bit systems, so we might #ifdef it out there.

This of course needs to be
   #define INITIAL_JIFFIES 0
for correct uptime display
