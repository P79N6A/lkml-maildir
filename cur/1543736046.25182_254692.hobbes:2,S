It looks like you are doing 2 different things here with this new macro.
Having it run last, and leting the user not type the PCI_ANY_ID macro
twice.  How about if you want to do a final final type pass, you mark it
as such, and not try to hide it in this manner.
And do we really want to call it "final final"?  What if we determine
that we need a "final final final" pass?  Can't you fix this with the
link order like was previously done?  I'd really prefer to not add
another level.
Oh, and cc:ing the pci maintainer might be nice next time :)
thanks,
