	In 2.3.24, <linux/tty.h> no longer pulls in <linux/serialP.h>.
A bunch of serial drivers were relying on this to get a definition for
SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE.  I am not sure that all of these drivers want to
have the same SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE as the dumb serial driver, but, for
now, I have patched these drivers locally to include <linux/serialP.h>
so that they compile and presumably are no worse than before.  If this
really was the correct thing to do, I would be happy to post the patch,
but I would like to know if this was correct, so I am pinging linux-kernel
and the driver maintainers about it.  The specific drivers effected are:
		drivers/char/ip2/
		drivers/char/isicom.c
		drivers/char/riscom8.c
		drivers/char/specialix.c
		drivers/char/sx.c
		drivers/char/cyclades.c
