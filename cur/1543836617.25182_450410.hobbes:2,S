I suppose....
What would be nice would be to have a plugin that when a node fails its
checksum/ecc it knows to get it from another mirror, and which generally
handles faults with a graceful understanding of its ability to get
copies from a mirror (or RAID parity calculation).
I would happily accept such a patch (subject to usual reservation of
right to complain about implementation details).
