This isn't going to be terribly useful other than giving someone a
heads-up there's a problem with something in 2.6.25-rc1 on the Alpha
PWS 433au.  I get the usual messages out of "aboot", including
aboot: zero-filling 210392 bytes at 0xfffffc0000776740
aboot: starting kernel vmlinux.new.gz with argument ro root=/dev/sda3
and then the screen background switches to red and the machine locks
up solid.  No further console output.  Completely reproducible.  The
2.6.24 kernel is fine.
Unless someone has a good idea what's causing this, I see a massive
"git bisect" project in my future.  Won't be able to spend any time with
this until at least the weekend :-(.
