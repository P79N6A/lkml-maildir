Changing the pointer is theoretically a safe operation since it is a
single memory access (and is basically atomic if aligned). However,
if the syscall may sleep and then the module is removed, you lose for sure
when returning through the code you inserted which is no more mapped (both
UP and SMP, but SMP makes it more likely).
