When the problem appeared, it turned out to be an incorrectly configured
and/or built gcc installation.  (therefore, by definition,  not a kernel
problem.)
I believe the reporter of the problem subsequently fixed his compiler
installation.
I do, however, think we need to lobby the gcc people to get the
"depreciated" status of -iwithprefix reversed - it is a simple solution
to an otherwise disgusting amount of grep/awk/sed.
