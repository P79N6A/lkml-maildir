I've got another one for you: SLOB ignores ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN so
using SLOB in combination with DMA and non-coherent architectures
causes data corruption.
That said, there are currently very few architectures that define
ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN, so I guess it might be something I'm doing
wrong on avr32. But I'd really like to know how other non-coherent
architectures handle DMA to buffers sharing cachelines with unrelated
data...
