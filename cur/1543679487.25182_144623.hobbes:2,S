Correct and if you wish to pursue monetary damages beyond legal costs, you
have to follow the rules.
The misinformation is a result of people assuming while under NDA, I did
nothing to help these companies come clean and get onboard.  The real
humor in the thread is the contempt and total mistrust people put on
others.  Yeah I could have stopped the entertainment earlier, but why.
Any NDA I have is with companies who are clean or are in the process of
dotting the i's and crossing the t's to be squeaky clean.
Also Dell is one of the cleaner companies out there in Linux community and
for people to lash out at Dell is totally wrong.  I tried to make the
point if there is an issue with Dell (which there is not) it will be
addressed.
The simple facts go, to protect yourself and to make a recovery under tort
you have to perform the simple task of registering your copyright.  If
people will do this it will make things easier during enforcement.
