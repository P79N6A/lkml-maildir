I completely agree. Filling the input buffer with timestamps looks quite
uncomfortable but was exactly what the hardware specification suggested.
At least for the initialisation of the PRNG I preferred get_random_bytes()
over get_clock to get a good initial seed. But get_random_bytes cannot
be used during normal operation since the PRNG read should not block.

Yes, if an attacker knows the initial clock value a brute-force attack
would be feasible to predict the output. But I don't know if the
hardware completely relies on the clock values or if there is any
internal state which is not visible by an attacker. I will try to find
out more details...
