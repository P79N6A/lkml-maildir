	if (atomic_dec_and_test(cond->num_waiting))
then you up cond->wait one time to often, leaving it in an invalid state.
II. Your implementation relies on the fact that the signal or broadcast
caller owns the mutex used in cond_wait. According to the POSIX spec 
this need not be the case. The only thing that may happen is that you
miss a wakeup. But it is not allowed to screw up the internal state of
of the condition variable, which might well happen in your 
implementation. (Note: Calling cond_signal without holding the mutex is 
not necessarily flawed software. Think of a periodically occurring 
new_data or data_changed flag where it is not really important to sleep 
race free)
III. Minor nit: You should also clear cond->ack.count
in cond_signal otherwise it may wrap around soon (at least for a
24-bit atomic variable) if you mostly use cond_signal.

As said in a previous e-mail, you need an futex_up(..,n) that
really wakes_up n thread at once.

Your exported waitqueues or my suggestion for a second waitqueue 
associated with a futex.
