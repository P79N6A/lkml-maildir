This is an old gremlin that should have been fixed for a long time... It
happens only, I think, when CONFIG_SCSI is not set, or something like
that. Basically, it never happens on our usual configurations, that's why
none of us never submited a patch for this.
I'll try to get this one fixed in my tree when I'm back on it so that
it's merged along with my bunch of new Macs patches.
