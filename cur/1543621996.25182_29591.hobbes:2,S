yes and no :)
We do not want to limit one-driver one-file, just support it.
And, makefile information needs to be included along with config
information.  For a more realistic example, when I add a new net driver,
I would modify
drivers/net/new-driver.c
drivers/net/net-drivers.conf
and the second file includes the makefile rules necessary to build
things.
For directories like kernel/* and mm/* and arch/*, I imagine that down
the road we will want kernel.conf and mm.conf too, though right now they
would probably remain as makefiles...
If you look closely at the problem, you will see there is no fundamental
reason why we cannot package makefile rules like we want to package
config information.
