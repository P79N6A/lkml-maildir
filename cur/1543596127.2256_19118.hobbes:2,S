Don't count on it.  I had completed a fully 64-bit OS in 1997 for IA64, 
four years before everyone else.  It's been sitting in an archive 
somewhere inside of Novell -- unused for no other reason than I 
wrote it.  I am waiting to see who would want it.  It's open to 
any takers.  Alan may be in a conflict of interest with Red Hat 
since Novell is an investor in them, so this I understand.  I'll 
wait and see who's interested.  I would not be surprised if 
someone from Novell asks to take it over.
