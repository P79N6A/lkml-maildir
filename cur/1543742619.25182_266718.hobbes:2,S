This is kind of weird:
Checking 'hlt' instruction... OK.
spawn_desched_task(00000000)
desched cpu_callback 3/00000000
ksoftirqd started up.
softirq RT prio: 24.
desched cpu_callback 2/00000000
desched thread 0 started up.
But:
rlrevell@mindpipe:~/cvs/wakeup$ chrt -p 2
pid 2's current scheduling policy: SCHED_OTHER
pid 2's current scheduling priority: 0
I do not think I changed ksoftirqd's priority.
