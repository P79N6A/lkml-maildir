I've put it here:
<

Meanwhile, I've traced the breakage to 2.6.24-git8.
2.6.24-git8 changed include/asm-x86/tsc.h:get_cycles() to call
rdtscll() even if CONFIG_X86_TSC isn't set. The call is protected
by a cpu_has_tsc test, but starting with 2.6.24-git8 cpu_has_tsc
is non-zero on this machine, which is very very wrong.
Diffing dmesg between git7 and git8 doesn't sched any light since
git8 also removed the printouts of the x86 caps as they were being
initialised and updated. I'm currently adding those printouts back
in the hope of seeing where and when the caps get broken.
