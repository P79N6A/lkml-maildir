Anaconda will barf and require over 850+ changes to the scripts without
it.  If you look at the patch, you will note that it's a silent switch
that's only there to avoid a noisy error message from depmod.  It 
actually does nothing other than set a flag that also does nothing.  
-m simply maps to -F.
