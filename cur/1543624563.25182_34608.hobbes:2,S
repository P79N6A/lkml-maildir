There's quite a bit of variablility between runs, so it's a little hard to pin
down. The number of locks taken doesn't seem to be affected much, and
that's probably the best indicator of whether this is really working.

No, I don't think I'm doing other stranger things to activate_page.
It does seem distinctly odd that we take the lock, *then* test whether
we actually need to do anything. Is the test just a sanity check that
should never fail?
