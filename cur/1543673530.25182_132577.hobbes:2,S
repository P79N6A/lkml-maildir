True. But traditionally with AFS or DCE at lest they have not. Each had its
own set of credentials, and the PAG was only defined to allow the credentials
to be shared.

Not sure what you mean here, isn't it the other way around,
the file system uses the credentials, which happen to belong to a PAG.
In the past the credentials only belonged to one PAG, so "joining" was 
a way to use the same credentials.

Yes I agree.

How long? Not sure.
It comes down to what is a "session"  A user may say "I will be 
contacting this system for the next four hour, so hold on to any credentials
I send you now, even though I don't have an open connection or an active process."
A user could do something similiar with a sshd and port forwarding, or a VPN,
to keep a session running but they should not have to resort to these
methods if possible.

Yes its an implementation issue.
