Subject: really no way to find a task? was Re: find_task_by_pid() in 2.2.3  unlinkable?

Actually, it appears there is no way to find any task structure
except for current! Is this some kind of lame security thing?
We can always use current->next_task to traverse the linked
list of all tasks, but this appears as a hack to me. The
problem with find_task_by_pid() is that it is inline, great
for efficiency, uncompileable in a module since htable isn't
exported.
Is this really the situation?
