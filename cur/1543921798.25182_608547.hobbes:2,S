Every one is so hysterical about this sg-chaining problem. And massive
patches produced, that when a simple none intrusive solution is proposed
it is totally ignored because every one thinks, "I can not be that stupid".
Well Einstein said: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication". So no one
need to feel bad.
I'm talking about Benney's Proposition of a while back.
(I'm including it below, cause I can't bother with the
stupid Archives broken search)
What Benny was proposing is that the scatterlist pointer
might not have the complete information about sizes and 
allocations, but the surrounding code always has, So why
not just pass this information to the decision maker - 
sg_next() - so it can make the right choice, before a suicide.
So sg_next() becomes:
static inline struct scatterlist *sg_next(struct scatterlist *sg,
                                          int next, int nr)
{
       return next < nr ? sg_next_unsafe(sg) : NULL;
}
Where sg_next_unsafe(sg) is what the original sg_next() used to be.
and a user code like for_each_sg() becomes:
/*
 * Loop over each sg element, following the pointer to a new list if necessary
 */
#define for_each_sg(sglist, sg, nr, __i)       \
       for (__i = 0, sg = (sglist); sg; sg = sg_next(sg, ++__i, nr))
In his patch he shows examples of other uses of sg_next they all fit.
The sg_next usage is new and in few places. Not like the sg->page
all over the kernel.
I know he has a patch for the complete kernel, (I know I helped a bit)
and it is a fraction of the size of all the patches that where submitted
after that. And it does not have all the problems that we still have now
with slob allocators, stack, and such.
OK Just my $0.2
