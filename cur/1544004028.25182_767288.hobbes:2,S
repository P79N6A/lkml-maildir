An idle question...

The above constitutes a sort-of userspace interface.  A number of the
things which are being reported there are fairly common to the
technology and other drivers will be able to report them.
But afaict this interface is unique to this particular driver.  Has any
thought been given to standardising this interface across all similar
drivers?  Too messy?
