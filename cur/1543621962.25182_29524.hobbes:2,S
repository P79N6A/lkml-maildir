Will do.

I'll remove the lock/unlock_kernel from there and shuffle the semaphore 
around.

Hmm i see wdt_pci uses its read call for getting temperature status, the 
only thing i can report back is the status of the watchdog, and that i 
currently send back via an ioctl call (WDIOC_GETSTATUS). The chip i have a 
datasheet for doesn't have temperature reporting via watchdog, but there 
are bits (supported by lmsensors) which can do that.

Its an ISAPNP device so we can probe like that (logical device 8), this 
particular module doesn't have PnP support (i was gonna add it later), i 
was wondering wether there was a possible non PnP probe we could do.

Thanks, but i think i wasted my time on this one, there is a driver for 
most of the SC1200 bits (including watchdog) at
