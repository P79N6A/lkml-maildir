Alan has said (quite reasonably) that he is not interested in inclusion
of the big IDE patch that exists for 2.2.x -- however, a minimal cut and 
paste backport from 2.4.x IDE to just support HDIO_DRIVE_CMD_AEB (and thus
support setmax) is only about a 100 line diff which I did a while ago.
If there is any interest in this I can check it still applies cleanly to 
current 2.2 pre kernel and send it along for inclusion.
Paul.
