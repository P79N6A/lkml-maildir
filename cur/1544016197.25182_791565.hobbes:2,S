For every process? What about short-living ones? Again, parent can not
be changed, since it has to stay, only its children should be killed
(and in some cases not eall, but only those from special set, like cgi
daemons started by the clients, and not database connections).

Which does not work for the specified cases. There is no way to specify
the pid of the short-living processes and parent can not be changed (at
least for long enough time).

It does exactly the same which happens for usual processes, it just
selects the ones with given name and then calculate badness and so on.
It has really nothing with memory group or cpuset, process is selected in
the given memory group.

If user specifies the name of the process he knows what he is doing. It
is always possibble to set it to null and avoid second scan.
More on this: the loop with check inside and loop without it in sum
equal to the loop with check and other processing.
Which means that if I change the patch to select two process: one with
given name and another one among the others, it will take exactly the
same time and will not introduce second loop (module loop prefetch
optimisations). For example:
loop {
  if (a)
    do_something1();
}
loop {
  do_something2();
}
equals to
loop {
  if (a)
    do_something1();
  do_something2();
}
Getting amount of the checks in that loop already, another one to
compare several (and most of the time just one) letters in the
name does not add overhead. So this does not count.
What really counts is the fact, that so far it is while not perfect, but
working solution for the problem I described, and existing (and
proposed) methods do not work.
