APM is special (or rather it SHOULD BE special: a lot of screwed implementations
out there still expect that you'll call them only from real mode). VESA calls
are not (that's why XFree86 4.0 must emulate real mode enviroronment and
why recently was thread about problems with that emulation). As XFree86 4.0
will emulate real time environment for multihead anyway I guess you'll be
able to add DCC support there easily. Not sure about svgalib, though...
