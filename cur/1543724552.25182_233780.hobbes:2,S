Hi,

These bitmaps are pretty much readonly and 4 bytes on most machines and 
this change makes them up to 128 bytes long. They are also naturally
aligned in the 4 byte case so cannot cross a cacheline boundary.
It makes much more sense to have all these readonly structures packed
together in the same cacheline.
