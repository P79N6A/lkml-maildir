Sounds like you were wrong.
This whole thing is silly, I'm very aware of battery life issues, but in 
real ues we are talking about maybe 3% more battery life. People who are 
totally anal about it will build their own kernel, or use a vendor 
kernel with varioble tick rate, but saving <2BTU/hr is not going to let 
anyone buy a smaller A/C unit. The computer user gives off way more than 
that.
I would leave it at 1k and push for variable tick, which should make 
everyone happy.
