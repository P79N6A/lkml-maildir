No, but with a little bit of additional code it CAN be safer.
Or maybe, we can store the classification in a different way.
What about putting the information directly into "ap->device[INDEX].class" 
in the sole caller (ata_drive_probe_reset) so far?

/* Define this to 15, if you need to */
#define ATA_MAX_CLASSES 2
struct ata_set {
        unsigned int class[ATA_MAX_CLASSES];
};
void set_ata_class(struct ata_set *cls, unsigned int idx, unsigned int what)
{
        BUG_ON(idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(cls->class);
        cls->class[idx] = what;
}
set_ata_class(&myclass, 0, what);
You can enforce that even better by making "what" 
a typedef like we do it with pte/pmd/pud/pgd in the VM.
But I prefer not passing this class stuff around, which would even safe
arguments and thus reduce code size.
Maybe we should even have a classify ata port operation instead?
