I haven't used the CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND needed for ACPI much; AIUI
it's still prototypical in various ways (or whatever the right way to
phrase that is), and I'm a bit too overextended to help out with it now.
There is an oddity I forgot to report: it doesn't suspend when I close
the lid if I still have the power plugged in. Also, I tried the suspend
button, and it works perfectly fine here for both suspend and resume on
a standard LTC issue Stinkpad T21, again with the power cord proviso.
