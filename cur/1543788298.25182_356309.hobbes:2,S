The part that you managed to miss is that this is MAC - *Mandatory*
Access Control.  This means that the *sysadmin* gets to say "this user
can't look at that file" - and there's nothing(*) either the owner of the
file or the user can do about it.  There's no chmod or chattr or chacl
command that the owner can issue to let somebody else read it - that's
the whole *point* of MAC.
(*) Well.. almost nothing.  The owner *may* be able to copy the contents
of the file to another file that the other user is allowed to read.  On the
other hand, the ability to do this would generally indicate a buggy policy....
