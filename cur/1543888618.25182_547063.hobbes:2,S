hm, this does not explain the /proc/net/tcp overhead i think - although 
it could be a red herring. Will have a closer look at your new trace. 
if possible please try to generate the automatic softirq trace for 
Thomas, and then a separate trace for the firefox/net-lag thing, using 
trace-it-10sec.c. Btw., for the second trace, could you boot with 
maxcpus=1? That would make the second trace quite a bit more 
straightforward to analyze. You probably need both cpus to trigger the 
softirq problem.
