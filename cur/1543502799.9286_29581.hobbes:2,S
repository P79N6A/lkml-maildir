Hi Ron,
You must get patch-2.2.6  patch-2.2.7  patch-2.2.8  patch-2.2.9  and
patch-2.2.10 patches and than:
1) do a "make mrproper" from inside linux source tree to clean the sources
2) unpack patches, if they aren't, using "gunzip patch-name" for .gz or
"bunzip2 patch-name" for .bz2
3) do "patch -p1 < patch-name" where patch name is patch-2.2.6 up to
patch-2.2.10
Thats all, cheers,
    Davide.
