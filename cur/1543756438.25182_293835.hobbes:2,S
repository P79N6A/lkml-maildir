It's necessary for reliable freezing under I/O load. Signalling the
non-sync threads first removes the race involved in some threads
submitting I/O while others are trying to sync. Try doing a dd and a
sync at the same time. The sync can take ages to return, worst case,
sometimes not until the dd is completed. (Actually, try doing anything
while a dd is running :>)

I don't think there's any issue here - or at least not a significant
one. I've had SMP support for just over a year, and I don't believe
there are any outstanding SMP specific issues in the freezer code (or
anywhere else in suspend2). All the resuming failures people get with
Suspend2 are traceable to device drivers (usb, dri/drm, cpufreq,
8139too, e1000 cards...)

No comment here? :>
