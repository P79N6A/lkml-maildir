I don't get you. The rtc module does something similar (RTC generates
interrupts and notifies userspace about it)
  irqreturn_t uio_handler(...) {
      disable interrupts for this dev;
      set a flag that notifies userspace the next best time;
      seomstruct->flag |= IRQ_ARRIVED;
      return IRQ_HANDLED;
  }
  /* Userspace->kernel notification, e.g. by means of a device node
     /dev/uio or some ioctl. */
  int uio_write(...) {
      somestruct->flag &= ~IRQ_ARRIVED;
      enable interrupts for the device;
  }
