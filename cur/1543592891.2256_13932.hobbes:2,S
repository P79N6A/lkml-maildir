Christopher Cole mentioned that he saw this problem, but it went away
after a reboot.  I rebooted into 2.4.5 again and the problem seemed to
have gone away.
But now, I got something else.... something that looks like a kernel
Ooops.  I was running automake and got the following:
kernel BUG at inode.c:486!
invalid operand: 0000
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[<c013fa2b>]
EFLAGS: 00010286
...
I'm gonna try 2.4.4 for now.  But if anyone is interested in looking
into this deeper, I can send the whole "oops" message and whatever other
info needed to debug this.
