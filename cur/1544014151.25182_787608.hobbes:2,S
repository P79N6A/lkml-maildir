I'm all ears for inputs how to make them even a little more readable.
We actually used several iteratiosn of Jan's patch just to improve
readability in areas the patch touched.
I think at least half of the unreadability comes from the fact that
people do not realise the steps needed to actually build the kernel.
It is a little bit more involved than doing a simple sequence
of gcc; ld.
We have btw. 1140 Makefiles in the kernel of a total of 28000 lines.
Yes - exactly 28000 lines as reported by:
find -name 'Makefile*' | xargs cat | wc -l
But numbers aside - any inputs appreciated.
