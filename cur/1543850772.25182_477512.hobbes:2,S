The final call to swap_free() releases the swap mapping and beyond that
point you can't tell which swap page you were dealing with.
try_to_unuse_page() calls swap_free() each time it removes a reference.
To make sure we control the last swap_free(), I had it take a reference
with swap_duplicate() and then we guarantee we call the last free. The
last free can then mark the page bad and take care of the accounting.
This does mean try_to_unuse_page() succeeds when the refcount is 2 and
not 1 as in the case of the usual try_to_unuse().

The reasoning was that this circumstance should be extremely rare. If it
happens, we have a hardware problem. Recovering from that hardware
problem gracefully is more important than a slightly longer interrupt.
But yes, process context would be nicer, *if* we can find a way to do
it.

Its a custom driver. I'm sure I can force it into using interrupt
context for the completions to try and test things although I'm also
fairly sure the existing patch will break when I do that for the reasons
you mention :-(.

I can't work out the code path it happens in and until I do, I'm not
sure how I can track it down...

Something must be but I wish I knew what/where...

If swap_writepage() is to check for an error, it will have to wait until
the IO is complete with something like wait_on_page_writeback() before
it can check. The performance implication is the extra
wait_on_page_writeback() on every call to swap_writepage(). In the
meantime, it will have to give up the page lock and then reacquire it.
Unless you're thinking of something different?
