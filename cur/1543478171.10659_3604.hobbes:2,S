You can try Alan's -ac stuff. Michael Chastain has already fixed
large menu by splitting it into three columns. 
Also Michael is working on rebuilding the code, I am working on
submenus, more people are working on bugfixes. So, I think, most
problems should be fixed before 2.2.0 (eventually 2.2.1) being 
released.
