I do not object kernel markers, and I have no idea where you got
that crap from.  Quite contrary I've worked with Matthew on
getting both markers and lttng good enough that we can merge

Documentation of kernel facilities should not mention big outside
blobs of crap nerverless, which is something totally different from
not mentionining userspace code contrary to your ill-advised position.
