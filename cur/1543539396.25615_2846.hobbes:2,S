Speaking about processor cache coherency in a multiple access mode look at
the intel developer site 
http://developer.intel.com/
 for a document named
24319202.pdf - Chapter 9 "Memory Cache Control".
If You're speaking about a shared/exclusive resource access, in Your case,
even if You access very few times in writing, You need a SWMR
( Single Writer Multiple Reader ) locking method.
This kind of access method will have anyway a spinlock/semaphore to grant
eclusive access to its data structures, and this can generate a cache
ping-pong
( in MP case ) onto the cacheline(s) holding the spinlock/semaphore.
