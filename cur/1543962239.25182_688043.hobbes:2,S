Yes.  You have a search space of less than 1000 possible combinations 
(64..20 bits), so it hardly is any reason to not search the entire 
universe of possibilities, even if by exhaustive search.
Now, if even that searching can't come up with the optimal solution (if 
one exists) in all cases, then the algorithm is broken.

Right, now we're talking policy, which obviously has to be entered by 
the user.
