Hi Andy,
Be good to try this with files served from ext2/3 as well,
to try isolate it to XFS/NFS.  We have a known issue thats
possibly related to this in XFS - Russell, does this sound
like that problem you've been looking at?
If you have a simple test case to reproduce it (we have an
extremely complex test case to reproduce that other issue,
but from your description I'm not sure its the same), that
would be very helpful Andy.
thanks.
