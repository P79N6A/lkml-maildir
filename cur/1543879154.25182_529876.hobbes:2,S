Hi Rik
I dont understand this last sentence. If not even a page fault happens, how 
the kernel knows that the page was eventually reused by the application, and 
should not be freed in case of memory pressure ?
ptr = mmap(some space);
madvise(ptr, length, MADV_FREE);
/* kernel may free the pages */
sleep(10);
/* what the application must do know before reusing space ? */
memset(ptr, data, 10000);
/* kernel should not free ptr[0..10000] now */
Thank you
