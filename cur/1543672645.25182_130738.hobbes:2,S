But no! Not at all. The context of a user does not need to be saved
on the stack, and in fact, isn't. It's saved in a task structure
that was created when the original task was born. The pointer to
that task structure is called 'current' in the kernel. It's in
the kernel's data space, and everything necessary to put that
task back together is in that structure.
Context switching is usually not done by pushing all the registers
onto a stack, then later popping them back. That's not the way
it works.
When a caller executes int 0x80, this is a software interrupt,
called a 'trap'. It enters the trap handler on the kernel stack,
with the segment selectors set up as defined for that trap-handler.
It happens because software told hardware what to do ahead of time.
Software doesn't do it during the trap event. In the trap handler,
no context switch normally occurs. This is so that the kernel can
perform privileged tasks upon behalf of the caller without the
overhead of a context switch. However, all the user's registers
are saved and the kernel's data selector(s) are set so that they
can access the kernel data and the user's data (the user-mode
pointers for file/IO work, etc.). This happens in the context of
the user, but the privilege of the kernel. If the kernel-mode
function needs to sleep, the user's registers have already been
saved it its "current" structure. The kernel is free to find
some other task to load from the run queue and switch to that
task (see switch_to()).
