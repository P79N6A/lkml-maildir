Hi,
   I upgraded from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4 last night. For the most part
everything went smoothly, except I'm starting to notice an annoying
problem regaurding smb mounted file systems (samba 2.0).  Whenever I
leave an smb share idle for a while, it auto disconnects. In 2.2.3, this
really wasnt a problem, because when I went to access a file on the
share, It would attempt to auto reconnect. In 2.2.4 however, this isn't
the default behavior. So whenever I leave my computer for an hour or so
and come back, I have to remount all the shares, which is somewhat
Irksome.

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated
