Fine :),  My (12 year old) 486DX2 already don't need Math-emu. I just
don't see how in a computer like that will be installed a kernel 2.6 .
So why code of math-emu isn't dropped ? 
Btw I try install a kernel 2.4 in my DX2 and works but very very slow .
I think in this type of computer should be install a kernel 2.2 . 
Thanks,
