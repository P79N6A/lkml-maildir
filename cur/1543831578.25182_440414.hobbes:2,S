A parallelism makes sense even if 1 cpu and 1 user task is there because
of IO.
From other hand if user thread actually does inodes write back, it may
wait a lot (fs, jorn, io queue) events and get context switch.
	The  results of 3-4 repeated runs of "/usr/bin/time -f  "%c"
iozone -i 0 -r 4 -s 1200m " in Pentium-4HT with 1GB RAM show that the
patch is useful for 1 cpu as well as for 2:
                                   Old_1cpu         new_1cpu
old_2cpu        new_2cpu

Maybe we should keep the sync-write logic if there is only one online
cpu, and thus avoiding extra context switches when they are not
profitable?
