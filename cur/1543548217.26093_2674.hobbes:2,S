Subject: [patch-required!] Recent kernels show problems in handling VERY large HDs

Hi everybody,
my name is Andreas Eibach and it's the first time I'm here.
I'm aware of the fact that posting here requires having read ALL FAQs and
available documents before doing that.
I did this, of course.
But since the problem seems brand-new (due to the fact that these huge-sized
HDs are very new), I could, however, find questions and answers on the ML
archives, but still no solution of this recent problem.
Please apologize this being longer than usual posts, but I feel the need to
go into detail very much so that the problem can be fixed soon.
My setup is: (relevant things only)
AMD K6-266 (oc'ed  @300)
Motherboard GA-586 SG  w/AWARD BIOS 4.51PG
(no updates available anymore from the manufacturer! 586sg  BIOS rev. is
1.15)
SDRAM
Maxtor 60 GB hard drive:
   - Capacity Limitation Jumper J46 APPLIED (otherwise BIOS does not
recognize the HD at all!)
   (note: this lets the HD look like a 32 GB one, causing total confusion
with the kernel)
   - EZDrive (aka MaxBlast) APPLIED (as _prescribed_ by original
documentation for older BIOSes)

Well this doesn't look _that_ nice... :)
So what did I do?
Since my Maxtor HD contains already 8 Windows partitions and is supposed to
"get Linux" on the 3rd third, I deleted everything except those Windows
partitions. Then I used MS-DOS FDISK to build two _very  big_ new partitions
in order to fill the thing up entirely to get rid of these
"Warning: Logical drive chain points to sector without partition table"
"Warning: EPBR partition starting at 71987265 is without logical partition"
(messages from PartitionInfo while testing HD - Partition Magic 5.0)
Back to Linux:
With CFdisk, I DELETED those two partitions again and wanted to start with
a, say, 300 MB  /  root partition.
Same error message again! (read_intr stuff....)
What I need is a kernel patch capable of handling this capacity limiter
correctly, because my suspicion is that everything BEHIND 32 GB (like in my
case, for 2/3 is used for Windows stuff) doesn't exist for the kernel, so to
say, an "Input past end" error.
Odd thing is, though, that the 2.4.0 test-x kernels do report the SIZE of
the hard disk all correctly.
Thanks for listening,
Andreas Eibach
