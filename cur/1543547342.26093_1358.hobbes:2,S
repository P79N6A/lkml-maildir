I'm not sure I understand the question. It would basically work like
booting in BSD or most other Unixes: the bootloader knows ext2 and
reads a filename that you pass as a command line option or a default
from /. That file name would be available in the environment that is 
passed to init. 
So nm $KERNELNAME should work usually to get the symbol table of the 
currently running kernel.

I guess a single bootloader that supports it optionally would be enough
for Daniel-Phillips-who-cannot-remember-where-he-put-his-System-maps ;) 
Of course bzImage would still be the standard way to boot.
