OK, then whatever tree contains them needs to eject them or be dropped
from linux-next.

Yes please.  For me it would be against scsi-misc ... for the other
drivers it would be their development tree.  The simplest thing to do is
probably to rebase them all on top of linux-next (which contains all of
our trees) and then send them to the individual subsystem maintainer
lists.
