But, as I understand it, not in PPC64 or in the mainline PC series.
What's really cool about the hashtable design is that each bucket will
have at most one useful piece of information but still fill an entire
cache line.

Which are almost certain to be unrelated, so two consecutive TLB misses
will almost certainly require two  fetches from main memory.
And, reusing a context requires a scrub of the hash table ..
Once you start down this slope, all sorts ofother disadvantages appear
for free.
