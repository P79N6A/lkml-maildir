I think this comes from being the guy down in the trenches implementing
the code.   And it is sometimes hard to look up, far enough to have design
discussions.
I totally agree that having a load/exec split is the right
approach now that I can imagine an implementation where the code will
actually work for the panic case.  Before it felt like lying.  Doing
the  split-up, promising that kexec on panic will work eventually,
when I could not even see it as a possibility was at the core of my
objections.
What brought me around is that I can add a flag field to kexec_load.
With that flag field I can tell the kernel please step extra carefully
this code will be used to handle kexec on panic.  Without that I may
be up a creek without a paddle for figuring out how to debug that code.
To be able to support this at all I have had to be very creative in
inventing debugging code.  Which is why I have the serial console
program kexec_test.  It provides visibility into what is happening
when nothing else will.  That and memtest86 which will occasionally
catch DMA's that have not been stopped, (memory errors on good ram) I
at least have a place to start rather than a blank screen when
guessing why the new kernel did not start up.
