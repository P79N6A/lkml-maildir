Ah, Okay.
confirmation:
1. Because mm->sem is held, there is no page-is-truncated/freed case.
2. Because pages in pagelist are removed from zone's lru, kswapd and others will not
    find and unmap them. There is no page-is-swapedout-by-others case.
So if all target pages are successfuly remvoed from pagelist, newlist must be empty.
Right ?
