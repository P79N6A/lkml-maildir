Last I checked, none of these were 100% open source.  I am certain this 
is true for Atheros, but IIRC it's also the case for the other two?
Anyway, WRT RealTek, they gave me (and others) docs.  If I can locate a 
card, I'll do a driver (or merge an existing one, if any).  RealTek's 
been pretty supportive of open source in the past, what with 
8139too/8139cp/r8169 stuff.
