Most of the problems you describe are the result of (partially)
disabling overcommit. I will be throwing away a few hundred Mb of
otherwise perfectly usable swap space (thereby increasing the chances
of OOM situations).
I know it's not a bright idea to disable overcommit in this way. I
never wanted to disable it at all. We have seen cases where systems
work BECAUSE of overcommit, where they would fail without it. If
someone can now come up with an example of a system failing WITH
overcommit in circumstances where they would not fail without it, I'll
be interested.
Until then, I will continue to regard overcommit as a feature, not a
problem.
James.
