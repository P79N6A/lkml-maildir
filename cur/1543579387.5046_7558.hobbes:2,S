I'm not opposed to that, and think it is even a useful idea. Sort of
like fdopen().

Thanks. I think having the option of the namespace augmentation would be
useful, in terms of supporting existing filesystems. On NTFS, ":" is not
a legal filename character anyway. The namespace augmentation suggested
in the paper would allow filesystems like NTFS to work as they should,
and all other filesystems to ignore it.
