See request_queue_t, the lock can already be shared. And in fact the ide
layer used a global ide_lock shared between all queues until just
recently.

Again, this is not enough! The lock will only, at best, serialize direct
queue actions. So I can share a lock between queue A and B and only one
of them will start a request at any given time, but as soon as request X
is started for queue A, then we can happily start request Y for queue B.
This is what the hwgroup busy flag protects right now, only one queue is
allowed to mark the hwgroup busy naturally. So only when request X for
queue A completes will the hwgroup busy flag be cleared, and queue B can
start request Y.
