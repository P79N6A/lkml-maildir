Gtk1 is going to be around for quite a while because so many apps wont be 
ported over to Gtk2 at all [dropped projects], and Gtk2 is not yet as 
widespread as 1.x either, so using Gtk1 is obvious. Qt2 vs. Qt3 - people tend 
to have the latest KDE if they run it, which means the latest Qt. Nearly all 
of the major distros ship with KDE3 now too (debian is still on KDE2 for some 
annoying reason, and Xandros (major?) have a hacked-to-bits KDE2).
