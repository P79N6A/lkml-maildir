Hi,
	Hope this is not the wrong mailing list.
	I seem to be having some interupt problems with the 3.1.18
version of the PCMCIA modules. Everything works fine until I suspend
my system. After the suspend my network card will complain about
droped interupts and my modem card will not work. I am running
2.2.17pre6 kernel on a Sony Vaio N505ES (from Japan) which uses a
Ricoh card controller. Any help and pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks
