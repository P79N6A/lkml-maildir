I hear you. There are certainly advantages to use a module parameter rather
than a boot argument.
However, there should not be two mechanisms to achieve the same goal. For
better or for worse, the hdX=<driver> construction exists, and people are
using it. Its use is not limited to ide-scsi.
Since it can very easily be adjusted to achieve the desired selectivety,
I believe it is the mechanism of choice. 
Does anyone else have an opinion?
Thanks, Willem Riede.
