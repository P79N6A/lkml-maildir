More specifically, BGP should have treated TCP resets as a transient 
error, to be expected (indeed, they /cant/ be a sign that a link is 
down - if you can receive a RST the link or path is patently quite 
ok). The BGP state machine should instead, in normal operation, have 
only treated Hold time expired as the definitive sign of "peer is 
down" and allowed reconnects.
