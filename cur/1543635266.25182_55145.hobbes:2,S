I have had reports of module threads being shut down by the cleanup
routine, the module was removed then the zombie threads were reaped and
got an oops because the module code that spawned them no longer
existed.  It is not clear why this is a problem, I will follow up with
the reporter.

With preempt it will.  The interrupt drops back through ret_from_intr
-> resume_kernel.  The preempt count is 0, preemption has only been
disabled on the sending cpu, not the receiving cpu.  need_resched is
entered immediately.
