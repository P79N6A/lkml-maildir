I hope I misunderstood you.
HZ is not only exported through /proc . It is an external interface,
which applications can depend on. No matter what. They can depend on
"read" reading in a piece from a file, they can expect "sleep (1)" to
last a second, and they can expect HZ to be the value it was when the
application was compiled. 
This also goes for commercial applications where joe random user
doesn't have the source for.
