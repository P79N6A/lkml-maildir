Unfortunately No ;)
I should rewrite memory notification patchset from scratch.
the new version will construct on memcg infrastrcture.
Why?
last year, I received many feedback from lkml folks and my article reader.
(I monthly write kernel patch introduction article to japanese web
 magazine and receive some feedback periodically)
I learned many people want flexibility notification.
(per workload, per user, et al)
eg. nokia lowmem driver have exception process defined by uid.
at top of last year, I thought memcg don't provide good infrastructure.
the first version memcg is just pretty funny joke. if its config turn on,
memory workload performance decrease ~30% although the user don't use 
memcg at runtime. then nobody use it.
but recently, KAMEZAWA hiroyuki (and Li zefan, Daisuke Nishimura et al)
dramatically improvement memcg performance. 
now, memcg overhead become less than 1%. 
Then, I think any memory accounting activity should use this infrastructure.
That's my homework.
