Suspend2 currently has a proc entry to do the same, but I can easily
hook into the sysfs code. /proc/acpi/sleep is already taken care of, as
is the reboot handler. Suspend2 currently uses resume2= so as to not
conflict with swsusp, but that can be changed too. I always to my utmost
to ease the pain for other users. If something doesn't work the way you
want, just tell me and (assuming it's reasonable), I'll fix it.
