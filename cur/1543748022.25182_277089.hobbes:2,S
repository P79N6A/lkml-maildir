What is your workload? Except the massive amount of inode's/dentries in your 
system do you have anonymous memory hungry applications running? 
If you do have a significant amount of anonymous pages on your system you might
want to try 2.4.29-pre1 which contains a VM change which should decrease their 
impact on the VM page freeing efforts (including kswapd CPU usage).
Since you have massive amount of inodes/dentries you might want to tweak
/proc/sys/vm/vm_vfs_scan_ratio (increase from 6 to 10 and so on...)

Can you boot with profile=2 and use readprofile tool to read the functions which 
are using most CPU time with
readprofile | sort -nr +2 | head -20
Do that on a 2.4.28 and 2.4.29-pre1 kernels.

Yes, v2.6 VM design is way better than v2.4's in many aspects.
