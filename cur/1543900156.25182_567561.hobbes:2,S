Hi,
Ok, the guilty bit is gcc: in my box, compiling kernel with gcc 4.2.x 
(which is installed on my debian/sid) turns into a hang (in init, 
seemingly, maybe not even in kernel itself), while gcc-4.1 is allright.
Probably it's something I had to know before... but the light lit when 
gcc crashed when compiling 2.6.22-git1...
Bye.
