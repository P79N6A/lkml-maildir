The bug (simultaneous calls to the interrupt handler on SMP) existed in
most 2.0 versions was fixed before 2.2.  A driver that needs to work
with multiple kernel versions must have the check.

The better solution, which I've been adding to the drivers, is to check
again for a just-cleared Tx queue after setting tx_full.
That trades an extra comparison on a rarely followed path for a spinlock
that is taken for every transmit and interrupt.
Remember: spinlocks are expensive!
