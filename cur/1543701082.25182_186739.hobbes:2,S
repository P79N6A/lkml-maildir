I've found that using "rivafb" does not work with my Geforce3, and from
talking to various people on IRC about it I get the impression that rivafb
is broken for any card newer than Geforce2. "vesafb" though works quite
well with never NVidia cards.
If I build my kernels with "rivafb" enabled I get a blank screen as well,
but using "vesafb" all is fine (so is just plain vga=normal or
vga=extended, but I prefer the fb console :)
