True, but the sensor returns the value as a signed integer in C.  That
is where the earlier negative number problem was, it would have to do
yet another conversion to go to Kelvin, and it would be just one more
potential for error.  Everyone knows that a bad conversion doomed at
least one space craft, let's stick to Centigrade.

The range for the sensor is -55 to 125 C, if an application didn't
care about precision they could store it in a signed 8 bit value just
fine.
