Hm. My BIOS claims that the C3 transition period is 85usec (and even my 
C4 is 185) , but I've hit the error path where C3 gets disabled. Is this 
really adequate? Also, by the looks of it, the C3 disabling path is 
still present - is it still theoretically necessary with the above, or 
is this just a belt and braces approach?
