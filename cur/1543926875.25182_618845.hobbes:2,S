Okay, well if that is the case I think you are going to have another problem 
in that you could end up throwing away skbs that haven't been through your 
security_post_recv_datagram() hook because you _always_ throw away the result 
of the second skb_peek().  Once again, if I'm wrong please correct me.

Where did the 'if (skb) return skb;' code go?  Don't you need to do you LSM 
call before you return the skb?
