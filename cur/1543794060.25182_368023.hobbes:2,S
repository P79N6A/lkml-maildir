Subject: [PATCH 02/11] unpaged: private write VM_RESERVED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/17/194

The PageReserved removal in 2.6.15-rc1 issued a "deprecated" message
when you tried to mmap or mprotect MAP_PRIVATE PROT_WRITE a VM_RESERVED,
and failed with -EACCES: because do_wp_page lacks the refinement to COW
pages in those areas, nor do we expect to find anonymous pages in them;
and it seemed just bloat to add code for handling such a peculiar case.
But immediately it caused vbetool and ddcprobe (using lrmi) to fail.
So revert the "deprecated" messages, letting mmap and mprotect succeed.
But leave do_wp_page's BUG_ON(vma->vm_flags & VM_RESERVED) in place
until we've added the code to do it right: so this particular patch is
only good if the app doesn't really need to write to that private area.
Dave Jones has changed vbetool & ddcprobe to use MAP_SHARED or PROT_READ
just as well, but we don't want to force people to update their tools.
