Hi Al,
Very neat!
Ron Minnich and I built something similar: we built private namespaces for
login sessions.  Ours have slightly different semantics I think.
To do so we changed mount+chroot into "imount" (i = invisible).  This landed
a process in a file system that had no root in the Unix directory tree.
(see the "Private name spaces, PNS" project on SourceForge.
We added another goodie, which was called "memdev".  It provided a new block
device from a private, i.e. copy on write, memory mapped block device.  See
"memdev" on SourceForge.
We used it as follows:
 - when you login, you get imounted into an environment where you have full
priviliges (except mknod).  The "/" of your environment is not a directory
in the Unix tree.
 - in this environment the system file systems are available to you on a
copy on write private basis.
 - any files you change get out over a network file system to a server.  We
used InterMezzo backed by a ramfs cache.
When the user logs out, everything is gone, except possibly footprints in
swap.
