I've made the changes, there is a psmisc 20.2 sitting in the sourceforge
CVS.  I will release it tomorrow morning.  Thankyou for your patch.  The
IPv6 related bug was also there and that is fixed too.
If you want to roll-back your kernel device code, you can do that or
not.  It seems the fuser patch doesn't care.
