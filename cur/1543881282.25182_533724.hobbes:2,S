Hey, thats a nice idea :). But, this woundnt reproduce the same
corruption right? Because, say, on first run of the tool there is
metadata stored at locations A and B and then on the second run there
may be user data present. I mean the allocation may be different.

You are right. Will modify that.

Right. I didnt think of that. Will look into it.
