I disagree. The big issue with the duplicated code is not how long it
is, but that it needs N changesets to fix something instead of one.
Typically a new ioctl also adds a new include.
If you keep the includes separated it'll have even more mainteance
overhead than before (you need N+1 commits to add the new ioctl)
