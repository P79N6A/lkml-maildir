Working on only two platforms is not really what I'd call portable.

True, we are relying on undocumented assumptions.  On the other hand, 
there's plenty of programs that rely on undocumented assumptions. 
Binary compatability to me means that the same binary will work even 
when the underlying system changes... is there a caveat that I missed?

If you don't care about binary compatability, you can change whatever 
you like.  At least some people out there seem to care about it.
