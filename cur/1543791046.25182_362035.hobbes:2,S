In current GIT kernels (2.6.14+) that patch is now merged, and
also usb-handoff is the default.

Huh?  That's not what you'd reported before.  What changed?
You're saying that _with_ that patch, and usb-handoff, it fails?

If the problem was IRQs getting somehow enabled after the handoff,
that patch would probably be a very useful thing.  If that does
help, I'll suggest that be merged into 2.6.14.x ... it'd have been
good to merge for 2.6.14.0 but quick merges seem mostly to be a
thing of the past any more.
