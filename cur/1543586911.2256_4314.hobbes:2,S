Probably unrelated to the issue below. Try a more recent 2.2 ?

You should be able to confirm this with my x86info tool.
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/davej/x86info/x86info-1.0.tgz
If this isn't the case, can you send me the output of
x86info -a on both CPUs ?
Note, that 2.4 should be disabling the serial number by
default.
(Unless you booted with the `serialnumber' bootarg.)

Dave.
