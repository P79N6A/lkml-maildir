OK, fine. I'll merge it into next -hf (probably within a few days). Please
insist loudly if you consider it important to fix quickly because it's a
real regression, as I don't want to have people wait for long if one hotfix
causes trouble.

OK, if it was your only concern, then I can say that it compiles and
runs on x86.

I know this, that's why I asked about the setup, config files and
test scenario :-)

Of course this is not the easiest setup just to chase a bug down. But with
such an explanation, a good manual on IPVS, and a lot of spare time, it
could be done if it was the only solution. But I'm not willing to spend
so much time on this yet :-)
