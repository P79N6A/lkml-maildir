Done. I've tried with 2.6.18-rt5. CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE is enabled.
Here are the results (still with running "ac3dec -C " and "md5sum *"
on a SATA drive): 
- I get no more ALSA xrun.
- /proc/latency_trace is empty
- dolby digital output is still considerably chopped.
Note that the dolby digital output works fine when:
- No I/O is done 
- heavy I/O on pata HDD (md5sum *)
- heavy I/O on DVD reader (md5sum *)
Did I miss something with the latency_trace ?
Cheers
