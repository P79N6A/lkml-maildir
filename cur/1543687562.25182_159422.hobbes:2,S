Hello,
I've been using kernel 2.4.22-pre6 with the smbfs LFS patch and the 
airo-lock-tx-fix.patch from Daniel Ritz <daniel.ritz@gmx.ch> with much 
success relative to 2.4.21.  Since I needed to make a minor change to my 
configuration, and because I got another "BAP setup error" and effective 
crash (it scrolled a stack dump continuously and kept scrolling slower 
until it got so confused it just locked up) I decided to try 2.4.22-rc2 
which seems to have incorporated [other?] airo patches.
However, with this new kernel, I can no longer 'modprobe airo_cs' 
successfully, even though I've done a proper(?) 'depmod -a'.  I can 
'modprobe i82365' successfully followed by a successful 'modprobe ds', 
but a 'cardctl ident' gives a series of "unable to map address space" 
type errors, that go something like this:

Thought someone might like to know ... I'm going back to -pre6 ...
