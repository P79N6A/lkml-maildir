Hi Andrej,
	Thanks for the excellent info; you've stimulated some possibly
good thoughts for me...

Ok, I agree completely with this; I don't see any good use for fE, it
really doesn't enhance security; if someone can explain to me why it
might, I'd be interested (Ted?)

Ok, this is what gave me pause; I've been considering how to design a
system around our capabilities model, and pI' = pI can be a problem in
many cases.  I suggest we drop the fE concept, and use it instead as an
inheritable mask, fM, and change the formula for inheritable to: pI' = pI
& fM.  This is nice for 'dead-end' programs, such as telnetd or httpd,
which really shouldn't allow spawned process' to inherit from it.
Instead, these should merely have CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE for fP, for
instance.  Using this extension, you allow programs to inherit privs when,
say, run by an administrator; but they inheritance will 'dead-end' with
that program.  This is good for, say, Ted's example of a trusted program
calling 'more'.
Thoughts?

Well, if we all agree that fE is pretty much useless, I think fM would
give a useful added flexibility to use in designing a secure distribution.
cheers,
