Yes. I'm definitely not claiming the code is beautiful. 
I think it happens to be working ;)

Yeah, the IRQ_INPROGRESS removal in handle_irq() was buggy: it caused the
bit to be spuriously cleared if an interrupt happened while the previous
interrupt was active (which will _not_ happen in the i8259 case, but does
happen in the edge-triggered case).
The problem, I think, is that all this code grew fairly organically, and 
nobody ever sat down and wrote down the rules. 
Which is why I think it _works_, but it's clearly nonoptimal and sometimes 
confusing.
I suspect the 2.4.x situation is even worse.
