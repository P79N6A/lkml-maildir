Fyi, another fact that was missing from the quoted thread: gcc 2.95
catches bugs that 3.x compilers simply miss.  Support for the old
compiler is more work, no doubt, and at times requires to work around
plain compiler bugs as well.  But there is some return on investment.
Is it worth the effort?  Not sure.  But the "it's old, drop support
for it" argument just doesn't cut it and it doesn't get any better by
repetition.
