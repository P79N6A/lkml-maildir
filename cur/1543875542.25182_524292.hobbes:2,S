If you think mangling patches by hand is a more effective use of time, no
one is stopping you -- some people even prefer that. On the other hand, if
you're struggling with an effective methodology before things are merged,
what reason is there to suspect that things will get better afterwards?
Going by Bryan's post, it's clear that the current system isn't working
for you at least.
