Hmm, I can't see them in my recent archives, I'm doing a Big Grep to try
and track them down. Perhaps you should repost the messages; if the panic
is preceeded by an oops, make sure that the symbols are resolved in some way
-- ksymoops is probably easiest. Knowing what kernel version would also help.

What 'diagnostics'?

Long term, you probably want to filter at your border routers. But you're
right, it shouldn't bring the machine down.

Two possible options spring to mind:
	i) He's looked at the source, and has found this out. In which case,
	it would help if he told us (the list) what they were, and someone
	would fix them. Perhaps you could ask him to do this.
	ii) he's talking utter bollocks.
I have my suspicions, but I'm not going to voice them.

Probably; first, I'd make sure you're running the latest kernel, or have
applied patches to fix any known bugs in the version you're using (for the
last few versions of  2.2, Alan Cox has got some detailed info at
<URL:
http://www.linux.org.uk/>
). Have a poke around in /proc/sys/net/ and see
if there are useful options to turn on -- Documentation/proc.txt is quite
useful to discover what some of them do. Investigate using ipchains or
equivalent to drop the offending packets. 
Oh, the grep finished. Can't see anything with your name or email address
on it, and my archives go back to mid-January :-(

Only it doesn't leave you much time to think about anything else.
