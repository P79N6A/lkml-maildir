This we can add now.

I see the value in this for weird mask devices, but I don't think it's a
"must fix" for 2.6 since the weird mask devices can advertise a lower
standard supported mask.
The aic driver, for instance, seems to have a 39 bit addressing range
(it uses 32 bit addr and 32 bit len descriptors, but reduces len to 24
bits to steal the extra byte for 7 bits extra addressing).  However, it
is forced to request the full 64 bit address mask---I've never worked
out what will happen to it on a machine with more than 512GB memory.
The lack of a coherent_mask is causing breakage on some platforms, so
putting it in is a 2.6 must fix thing.
