Hi,
I spent last evening hacking around  in the serial driver doing things like:

That way I found out that receive interrupts are not enabled when DTR is 
set and CTS cleared. When you put the signals in the other direction it 
works! Of course CLOCAL and CREAD were both set. IMHO if CLOCAL is set the 
driver should NOT care about the modem status lines...
BTW: Reading the IIR in my patch above might be dangerous as it could reset 
the interrupt request...
Regards,
Ulrich
