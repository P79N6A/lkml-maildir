Yes, and it is, as others have said in this thread, which is a good 
reason why ISRs can't sleep.

Depends on which book or article you are reading I suppose.  The 
generally accepted and often used thought is that ISRs technically are 
running in the context of the interrupted process, but because that 
context is unknown and therefore should not be used, it is often said 
that they run in no context, or outside of any context.  Sometimes 
people then assume that because they run outside of any ( particular ) 
process context, they must be in their own context, but this is a mistake.
