It would be possible to use a work queue similar to the socket lock:
You lock against interrupts with a counter and when it is >0
they queue items (in this case function pointer + data) into a special
queue. The queue is processed after unlock with the functions called in turn.
A cheap variant for infrequent accesses of this is to start a 1 jiffie
timer.
To serialize user context you use a semaphore or the BKL. 
Unlike networking there are no ready allocated data structures yet so 
it would require an additional kmalloc/kfree (probably better spent time
than spinning)
