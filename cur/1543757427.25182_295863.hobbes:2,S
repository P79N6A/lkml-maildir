	It doesn't sound like you've programmed in functional languages all 
that much.  While I don't have any practical experience in Haskell, I 
can say for sure that my functional code in ocaml blows my C code away 
in maintainability and performance.  Now, if I could only get it to 
dump core...
	Haskell was a draw for me.  It's very rare to find someone who 
actually knows C and can write bulletproof code in it.

	Then what gets transferred over the wire?  The full modified ,v file?  
Do you need a smart server to create deltas to be applied to your ,v 
files?  What do you do when someone goes in with an rcs command to 
destroy part of the history (since the storage is now mutable).
	I use both darcs and arch regularly.  darcs is a lot nicer to use from 
a human interface point of view (and the merging is really a lot 
nicer), but the nicest thing about arch is that a given commit is 
immutable.  There are no tools to modify it.  This is also why the 
crypto signature stuff was so easy to fit in.
	RCS and SCCS storage throws away most of those features.
