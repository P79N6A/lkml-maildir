OK
Why haven't they been subscribed already, then?
I think you would agree that right now the choice of subsystems in the Bugzilla
doesn't reflect the current status of the kernel (some subsystems should be
added, some should be called differently, some should be moved to different
places etc.) and some addresses to which the bug reports are assigned by
default are not the best ones ...

I do.  Some architectures have multiple platforms that are maintained by
different people, etc.

I just realize that there are people who wouldn't like to use the web interface
and would prefer to use email instead.
Moreover, you won't force people to use the web interface only for reporting
bugs, because frankly for some kinds of problems it's too heavywieght
(compilation problems and purely software, reproducible things like that are
much faster resolved using email; this also applies to easily reproducible bugs
in general).  Still, it wouldn't hurt if they were automatically tracked.

Sure.
