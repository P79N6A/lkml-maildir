I'm not sure. It may not impact other filesystems, but it impacts the
internal consistency of the dentry tree, and can cause some really nasty
aliasing issues.
If d_invalidate() returns a failure, that means that the dentry is still
hashed (because it was busy), and returning NULL and leaving the dentry
there sounds very wrong, since it can never be fixed with a new lookup.
