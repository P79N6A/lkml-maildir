I had _lots_  of corruptions on my box with  2.2.8, the last
new kernel i tried. I had to reinstall the hole box and went
back to 2.0.36. 
I'm not using  quota but an adaptec u2w  scsi. Old ide disks
are  used  for  backups  from time  to  time.   Kernels  are
compiled  with gcc-2.7.2.3  which has  internal errors  from
time to time.
I wont switch back to 2.2.x til this gets fixed. Sorry.
	Regards,
	Micha.
