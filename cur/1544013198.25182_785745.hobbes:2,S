Here is a series of trivial patches. The only
one I'm doubting about is
	mm: hugetlb -- get rid of redundant if operation
since this form of 'if' was here pretty long time either
there is nonobvious reason for it or it just happened
to take place (well there is also a third varian which
I would prefer to not reveal -- I've missed somthing :-).
Please review
