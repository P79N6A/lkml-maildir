Umm, I don't have that lsprop installed, let's see if this is enough:
cat /proc/device-tree/openprom/ibm,fw-vernum_encoded
TCP00032
cat /proc/device-tree/openprom/ibm,loc-code
P1
cat /proc/device-tree/openprom/model
IBM,TCP00032
cat /proc/device-tree/openprom/name
openprom

Ah, that could be it, yes.
But this doesn't explain the problem we are having with the card under linux
once we boot from the net ;-)
Thanks again!
