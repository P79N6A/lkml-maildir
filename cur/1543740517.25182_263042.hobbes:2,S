Yes, but my concern was having to backoff in out-of-sequence
spinlock acquisition paths. Looking at it again if the canonical
lock acquisition sequence is a task's mutex-owned list then a
mutex's task-owned list, the nondeterministic backoff (if any)
gets pushed to the case of a waiter blocking on the lock.

My concern is removing what should be available reader
concurrency for the mutex in question. I can't assess
how un/common that may be over all application scenarios.
