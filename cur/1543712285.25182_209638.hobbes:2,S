OK.  I can reproduce this under both 2.4.25 and 2.6.4.
To prepare for the test, you need to arrange for an ext3 file system
which is short on space.  In the following example, I'm using one with
around 12Mb of free space.
You'll also need a way to write/delete files quickly.  The above shell
fragment probably doesn't in bash since it's very slow.
So I've attached a C program which does a similar thing.
I've also attached the script output of it running in my VMware machine
running 2.6.4.
Cheers,
