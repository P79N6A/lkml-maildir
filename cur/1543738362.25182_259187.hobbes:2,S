Assuming that ioctls passing _pointers_ are declared correctly with _IO*
that shouldn't be the case:  _IOC_DIR(cmd) == _IOC_NONE means _IO()
means no pointer passed in.

Hmm, it broke for videotext, checking ...
Ok, you can drop it.  The videotext ioctls (include/videotext.h) don't
use the _IO*() macros but pass around pointers anyway, thats bad.
Michael, you'll have to fix the saa5246a driver.  video_usercopy() will
not work for you because the videotext ioctls doesn't use the _IO()
macros.  You have to do the userspace copying in the driver yourself.
