Subject: [patch] bigmem fix for random out of memory (for 2.3.25)

Leonard spotted a bug in the bigmem initialization code. I couldn't debug
it as it can't trigger with the bigmem emulation.
Actually GFP will return NULL if RMQUEUE grabbed the physical page at
address -PAGE_OFFSET. Lenonard fixed this to just avoid to put the
bigmem in the freelist and I would do the same too as one page is not a
big deal with real bigmem hardware.
I merged his plain fix in my 2.2.13 bigmem and I reworked it for 2.3.25.
The other cleaner way to fix this bug is to change GFP to return a `struct
page *' or the `pfn' and the other way is definitely not a one-liner ;).
Even if we want to fix it properly in the other way we can go with this
trick today (it will be trivial to remove the check later).
