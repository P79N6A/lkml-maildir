Absolutely.
And if overall system design is good, there is no problem to change
(well, for those who fail to read to the end and understand my english
replace 'to change' with 'to create and commit') interface to the state
where it will satisfy all (majority of) users.
Situations when system is designed from interface down to system ends up
with one thread per IO and huge limitations on how system is going to be
used at all.
