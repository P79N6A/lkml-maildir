I know suns can do this.. I just set up an enterprise 6000 with dual
fiber channel controllers going to one a5500 storage array. It works
pretty well. I believe it is a feature of veritas that implements this.
I dont think it is a kernel or hardware feature. You might want to 
search sun's website a bit and maybe you can get some technical data
to get you started.
