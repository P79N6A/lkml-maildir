You're *absolutely* correct about the issue that these "fixes" that remove
such conditions end up remove range-checking making the code more
flakey / less readable.
However, gcc is _just as correct_. It is only crying about seeing a condition
that the programmer could have written with some purpose in mind but which
is being completely compiled away by it when generating the code because
of it being a tautology / contradiction ...

No, shutting gcc up wouldn't be the right thing, IMHO. These warnings are
a good reminder to the programmer to go and see if there is a real bug
somewhere and if something really needs to be done with the code (could
be simply to change the type of a variable to signed that was mistakenly
declared unsigned, f.e.).
But yes, the kind of "fixes" you pointed out that _remove_ these conditions
are definitely *not* what we would want to do.
