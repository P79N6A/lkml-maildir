If you want to fix them I won't stop you...
Until they are fixed I'm staying at using the defconfigs.
But then there's still the other problem that at least I simply don't 
want to wait two weeks for having the test compiles of a patch finish.

That can't be true.
Can you name what architectures you think of and why you think noone 
tried to compile them before?
