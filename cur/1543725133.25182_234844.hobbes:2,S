You've really got to eliminate the binary bcm5700 and nvidia modules in
order to diagnose this. Based on the oops, bcm5700 looks suspect, but it
could just be the unlucky guy whose memory was stepped on by nvidia or
some other part of the kernel.
Switch to an open NIC like e1000 temporarily (or better yet,
permanently) and see if the lockup persists. Do the same with nvidia. If
you can reproduce the problem without ever having loaded either module
(unloading the module once it's loaded is not sufficient), post the new
oops and you'll have a solid foundation for debugging.
