Hi,
after applying mem=nopentium as a boot parameter
I've been able to play tuxracer _for the first time_.
Prior to this any OpenGL application deepfroze
the system after 10-20 secs.
Tried some other Loki-Demos, they run just fine
now.
I do _not_ have an NVidia card, it's a Matrox G450.
I wasn't able to use OpenGL on both Athlon-systems
I used (was Athlon 600 w/ G400, is a Thunderbird 1333 
w/ G450 now), been trying it ever since XFree86 4.0 and
with (almost) any kernel that was released since then
(It's 2.4.16-pre1 right now).
So whatever the deeper reason, there _is_ something
fishy that this workaround seems to fix and it seems
not to be tied to NVidia drivers.
Mark.
