Slight problem. This paper is about a patented SGI method for handling
defragmentation into large pages (6,182,089). They patented it before
the presentation.
They also hold patents on the other stuff that you've recently been
discussing about not keeping seperate rmap structures until there are
more than some value 'n' when they switch from direct to indirect lists
of reverse mappings (6,112,286)
If you are going read and propose things you find on Usenix at least
check what the authors policies on patents are.
Perhaps someone should first of all ask SGI to give the Linux community
permission to use it in a GPL'd operating system ?
