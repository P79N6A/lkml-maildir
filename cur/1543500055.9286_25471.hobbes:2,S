Absolutely.  In recent years, I have looked at the gross code expansion
done by the X server build (where some substantial code is compiled
multiple times, and in each case there is some pretty aggressive loop
unrolling) and thought that this might well be wrong given today's cache
issues.  But I never did anything to test that theory.  I'm glad to hear
that Keith has (as ever) been doing some good work in this area.
