In the it-would-be-nice department... While I was twiddling with swappiness 
and benchmarking some code, I thought it would be pretty cool if there was a 
node in /proc/<pid> that would show which pages of a process are resident or 
nonresident. I'm not sure that it would be useful very often, but I was 
thinking one could get a snapshot of that, correlated with traces from a 
malloc profiler, to show what portions of a program's memory usage was in 
active use vs idle.
