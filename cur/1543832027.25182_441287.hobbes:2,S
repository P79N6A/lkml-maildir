Copies like the one on the glass I used in the restaurant ...

That's why every waiter will assiduously clean your glass. won't he?

That's the problem: You can't know who is acting responsibly and who isn't.
Therefore you can't reuse your fingerprint on different sites.

ACK. It should be protected by a nonce, too, as long as you depend on
encryption. You should also authenticate the reader before prompting for
a fingerprint, otherwise the replacement device might store the image to a
secondary location. And don't forget to prompt for cleaning the scanner, I
have heared rumors about scanners erroneously authenticating the previous
user. You should also install a camera preventing an attacker to place his
own scanner on top of yours.
