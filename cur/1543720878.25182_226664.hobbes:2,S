Hi,
I've come upon a strange problem using a stock first generation iMac
from Apple.  The system is running a 2.6.6 kernel, and loads most of
the modules via hotplug.  Unfortunately, some keys do not work, and
the log shows the following two entries:
 drivers/usb/input/hid-input.c: event field not found
 drivers/usb/input/hid-input.c: event field not found
I played with this a little, and it turns out that the problem goes
away if I either boot with the keyboard detached and plug it in when
the system is up and running, or build evdev into the kernel instead
of as a module.  Both solutions are not acceptable, so I'd be grateful
for hints or fixes.  If there is any information I can provide, please
let me know.
Regards, Jens.
