Well it's just 'breaking' old behavior in certain error cases.  I.e. if
audit fails, or no handler is found for the binary, we never reach
compute_creds (which is called from within the binary loader), so in 
the past keep_capabilities would have remained 1 until something was
actually executed.  Now in all likelyhood the process would try to
exec something else, but if it should happen to decide to setuid()
instead, with your patch keep_capabilities will have been unexpectedly
set to 0 during the failed exec attempt.
