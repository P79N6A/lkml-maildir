I generally have to agree with you about the unsigned char* vs char*. It 
is a problem of the C language that char can be signed and unsigned, and 
that people, as a result, have used it for storing 
"shorter_than_short_t"s.
What C needs is a distinction between char and int8_t, rendering "char" 
an unsigned at all times basically and making "unsigned char" and 
"signed char" illegal types in turn.
