correct.

Exactly what you get when the owner is hidden. Whose app got executed
that created/destroyed someone elses files? What files were created?
It all runs under the web server account... but the results are owned by
the attacked user so it looks like the user did it. Anything a CGI can
create, a CGI can execute or cause to be executed.
If you want a secured web server, DON'T let users create CGI. and don't
give the CGI the capability to execute other programs either. And this
is where compartmentalization comes into play.
All you know is that maybe the attack was via a web server. But you can't tell.
