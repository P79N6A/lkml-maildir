I think there was pretty good agreement, when we started doing that,
that taking out the if statements in the callers was a good idea.
If it turns out to have been a net loss that's not good, but I don't
think it's been a wasted effort - there were a *lot* of places that
checked for NULL before calling [kv]free, and now that we've gotten
rid of them we can consider adding them back where it makes sense, not
just all over the place.
We could also consider changing the
 if (unlikely(!obj))
 return;
in kfree into simply
 if (!obj)
 return;
