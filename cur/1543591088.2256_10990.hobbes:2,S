Are you maybe talking about scsidev? It can produce names like /dev/scsi/ 
sdh24-e000c0i12l0p1 (ugh). It can *also* create names like
/dev/scsi/QAt-p3 for "that's the third partition on the Quantum Atlas, I  
shouldn't put important stuff there because Quantums like to break". (The  
QAt part comes from a config file.)
The latter I've used for quite a while (until I found mount-by-UUID). The  
former is unspeakably ugly.
