So here is the report :
1) The file which affects the playback is
/proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/sub0/status
2) I tried to remove only
 snd_pcm_stream_lock_irq(substream);
 snd_pcm_stream_unlock_irq(substream);
3) I tried to remove only
entry->c.text.read = snd_pcm_substream_proc_status_read
4) I tried to remove irq calls, substream proc calls and
proc_status_entry calls
And it still doesn't work but...
pcm.c from my 2.6.2-rc1 and pcm.c from my 2.6.0 are the same...
Or on my 2.6.0 the sound works without any problem...
I use the same elevator "deadline".
I've Preempt enabled on both...
I'll maybe try the standalone version of alsa-drivers with 2.6.2-rc1...
Btw I'll try the 2.6.2-rc2 kernel before.
