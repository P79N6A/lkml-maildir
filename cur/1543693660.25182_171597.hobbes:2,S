Hi,
Got 5 minutes to look at this today, here is the proper fix. This allows 
to compile for Winchip when CONFIG_MTRR is off. The alternative would be
to pull in asm/mtrr.h and asm/errno.h, but it seems a bit overkill since
we only need mtrr_centaur_report_mcr.
Booted and working fine here on my small gateway box for the past hour.
Please apply.
Regards,
Nuno
