Teaching esd to talk to NAS is one solution. However, everything else
here is chattering to esd happily (and no, that doesn't include GNOME,
that's not installed here).
Also, NAS appears to be effectively unmaintained. At least, it's
unchanged since 1995, and there is lots of stuff in TODO, so it's not
`stopped because finished'. And I'd rather give a program that's being
maintained control of /dev/dsp.
To be frank, I'm not using esd's network-awareness at all; it's no good
at that. However, NAS is not very good at the audio output side compared 
to esd (it never lets go of /dev/dsp, and so can't interoperate with
non-NAS-aware audio systems at all). So I'd rather use both.
Frankly, we need *one* mixer, not five hundred... (maybe alsa will be
the solution to this...)
