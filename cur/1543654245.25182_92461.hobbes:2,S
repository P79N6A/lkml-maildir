IDE does handle the I/O quite differently so Im not sure about that.
Accidentally fiddling with an in flight request tends to do horrible
things on IDE but not on scsi for example.
The base 2.5.47/8/9 Linus tree PIIX code has had no corruption reports
(except someone whose box failed memtest86) and its about the most
tested IDE controller.
I would be interested to know what happens if you boot a base 2.5.49
without raid6 adulteration and stress it on your hw there, just to be
sure.
