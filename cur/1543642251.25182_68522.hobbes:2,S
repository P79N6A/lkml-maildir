It is not the controllers that know, but the type drivers.  The controller
drivers should be conduits for commands, nothing more.  With the proper
events and error codes, the type drivers can maintain mode parameters
and only the type drivers know what parameters are appropriate for their
type of service.
For FC, you need to use ECA/ACA anyway as that is the only way to deal with
inflight commands at the time of an error.
