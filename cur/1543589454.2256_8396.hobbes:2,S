Oh for fsck's sake.  You've now wasted 1000x more bandwidth bitching
about sig length than the the actual sig used up.
Get a life.  Ignore that which displeases you.  Ignorance is bliss.
You are no longer a republican.  Eat your vegatables.
Just stop whining about ESR's sigs already.
And now back to your regularly scheduled kernel hacking.
(woo! sluggy freelance. poing!)
