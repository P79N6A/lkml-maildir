Not sure if this question concerns this group .. Writing a small
application which creates schedules based on the ( Least Laxity First )
LLF algorithm . Not sure at what instants is the scheduler invoked ?
i.e. the task with least laxity is selected at every time unit ? Also,
if i take into consideration the context switch time , how would it
effect the algorithm ?
Thanks ,
