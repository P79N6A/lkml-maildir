I tested with 2.4.19-rc2-ac2 and it is effectively far far better.
With previous kernels, it used to reset the card every few (2 or 3) 
megabytes transferred.
With this one, the reset happened only one time in a 600MBytes 
transfer, so it is incomparable.
(and I had to make several tests to eventually see this bug happen)
Thanks a lot for your support.
