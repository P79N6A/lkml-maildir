"strings" on the fw binary shows there is some debugger (SACHEM-LT and
possibly more things). It probably needs some terminal interface,
there might be some diagnostic port (usually TTL-level RS232) on board
or (in this case almost certainly) it's created over USB.
It would require some amount of work, not sure if it's worth it.
