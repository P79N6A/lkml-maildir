What does this mean? The raid is syncing at 20MB/s, not each disk, so I do
not see what the multiplication is about.

I do not see this as relevant, but four concurrent hdparms (each to a
different disk) give about 30MB/s per disk. I expect the controller
to talk to the four disks at their full speed so concurrency should
not be the issue.

'hdparm -T' gives about 1250 MB/sec so this is not the limiting
factor.
