I had a related problem on 2.0.36 (final); I had outgoing client connections
(i.e. from a web browser on my server) stuck in CLOSE_WAIT for a couple of weeks
or more (long after the associated process went away), then they suddenly went.
I have also seen incoming ftp connections (i.e. to wu.ftpd on the server) hanging
around without an attached wu.ftpd process, but this went after an hour or two
if I remember correctly. I can't remember what state it got stuck in, unfortunately.
I did mail Alan but quite understandably didn't get a response - either because
I didn't provide enough info or it just got lost in the huge torrent of email
he no doubt gets each day.
I started poking around in the tcp socket guts but it will no doubt be years
before I get up to speed on it all. Expert advice would be much appreciated..
Cheers,
Steve
