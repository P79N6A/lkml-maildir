I think Pavel's idea is brilliant. "Includes driver sources"
captures exactly the essence of dependable support for Linux.
Aunt Tillie will eventually learn that this strange sentence means
that, even if the thing doesn't work when she attaches it to her
PC, her nephew will be able to make it work for her.
And in a few years, when she buys a new PC with a new distribution,
there will probably already be a driver included.
What else could she ask for ?
