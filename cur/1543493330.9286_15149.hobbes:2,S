One thing to think about for caps in elf headers: what should be done
for the case of elf on a file system with intrinsic support for caps?
Ok, so you probably have a mount option so you can mount with or without
that intrinsic support, but with support enabled there's some interesting
issues with respect to conflicts between the elf and the fs.
