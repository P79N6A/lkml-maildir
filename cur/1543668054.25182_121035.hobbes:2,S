hi all,
it appears this type of error hasn't been seen since the late 90's or so,
and the fix then doesn't apply to now.  i tried this first on linux-net,
but go no response, so i thought i'd try LKML.
i have a remote-mountable HP logic analyzer (HP 16500B) that provides an 
NFS export at /control and /data.  network-wise, it's configured fine -- 
it can talk to the world, the world can talk to it via ping, telnet, and
ftp.
where it's falling down is when i try to NFS mount the spaces:
   root@hammett # mount hp16500b:/control /mnt/16500b/control/
   mount: RPC: Authentication error; why = Invalid client credential
i've tried playing with "-o nfsvers=2" and such, but nothing i do seems
to really change it.  way back in '95-'98, there was some discussion 
about seeing this error on occasion.  the answer was to be sure "root"
didn't belong to >= 8 groups.  on the PC (modified RH8) that's not
an issue.  root belongs to 4 groups.
obviously on the HP box, there's very little i can configure.  the idea
of "root" doesn't even exist.
does anyone have any suggestions for how to get around this problem?
thanks,
josh fryman
