This can be a potentially harmful change, suddenly exposing compiler 
bugs and other compiler related problems in the kernel code we have not 
yet seen. On one side, these bugs _should_ get fixed, on the other side, 
we might not find them all before release. Also, the pentium3 and 
pentium4 options have been known to compile for example bad SSE code in 
some gcc versions, something that's giving me a feeling those gcc 
options may be a little immature to use for a stable kernel series.
In my opinion, of course.
