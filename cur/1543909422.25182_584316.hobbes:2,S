the other angle is this: if someone becomes the new maintainer, does he
really want to "maintain" all the really old versions of the code out
there that predate him, or does he only want to go forward? 
He wouldn't know anything about, say, the 2.4.21 version of the driver
anyway... nor would it be reasonable to expect him to.
I can an option where distros just set all the maintainer data to
themselves for long lived enterprise products... since effectively they
are the de-facto maintainers of those codebases.
