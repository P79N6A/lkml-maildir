LK and Linus,
I have put forth the first steps in address a problem in the ATA-SPEC.
This action should now protect Linux, because we have shown there is a
problem and it needs to be corrected or not every hope Linux copable for
any actions performed by the OS/Driver.
Thanks for you time and your flames while I figured out the final best
solution, return the buck back to the manufacturers.
