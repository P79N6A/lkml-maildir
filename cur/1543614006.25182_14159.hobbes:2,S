Oh well, sorry, so let's say about 'k' and 'm'. However an engineer friend
of mine has just say that 'K' is 1024, and 'k' is 1000 ... I dunno anymore ...
[however I've never seen 'Kg' instead of 'kg', but 'mB' or 'mb' are ugly
when compared with 'Mb' and 'MB', not counting that 'b' is bit and 'B' is
byte ... well ... it's confusing sometimes ...]
