acpiphp: Identify more removable slots
    According to section 6.3.6 of the ACPI spec, the presence of an _RMV
    method that evaluates to 1 is sufficient to indicate that a slot is
    removable without needing an eject method. This patch refactors the
    ejectable slot detection code a little in order to flag these slots as
    ejectable and register them. Acpihp therefore binds to the expresscard
    slot on my HP test machine.
    Signed-off-by: Matthew Garrett <mjg@redhat.com>
this makes acpiphp handle hotplug of (now one, sd reader is somehow
always present) card reader.
