IMO this is very incorrect -- the high volume submitters have never 
posted their stuff to lkml when sending to Linus.   BK did not change 
this at all.  Andrew is the notable exception.  [1]

posted to lkml, security patches should go out-of-band, etc.  Do you 
_really_ want to see boring and huge arch merges posted to lkml?  Ug.  :)

[1] One might argue that Ingo is another exception, but I don't count 
him among the high-volume submitters.  This is not intended to diminish 
him, either:  Ingo probably has one of the highest "important/trivial" 
patch ratios of anybody in the kernel...
