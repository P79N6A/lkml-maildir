I can live with the change - powersaved has a setting "consider_nice" to
configure this and i can put out a support article telling people to
"invert" this setting if they are running custom kernels, so it is not
really a showstopper for me. Most of the users don't understand thos
settings anyway ;-)
I'm not sure what is better for me - a nice short name or a clear
indication on which version we are running ;-)
