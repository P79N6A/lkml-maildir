Well, yes and no. cancel_rearming_delayed_work() requires that dwork
re-arms itself unconditionally, otherwise it just hangs (actually, the
patch to fix this shortcoming is ready). However, ata_pio_task() for
example, re-arms only when ATA_BUSY.
So it is very possible that the code is correct, if the caller of
ata_port_flush_task() ensures that ATA_BUSY is not possible. Otherwise
we should change cancel_rearming_delayed_work() and use it.
Oleg.
