ok - ie we ignore HW that may be present.
In a way, this makes sense since LAPIC was used for
IRQ "load balancing" - ie IRQs could get redirected
to another "less busy" CPU.  IIRC, discussions about
"XPR" should explain how that works.

Yeah, my preference would be PCI_MSI only depend on Local APIC.
(Note that having a Local APIC implies having an IO APIC as well
- but MSI should completely ignore it.)
But I don't know enough x86 history to know if thats feasible
or not. And I'm not blessed with the time to unravel the x86
APIC support - if the dependencies are necessary, so be it.

Interesting. I'm suprised an MSI can get "lost".
It implies MSI code is allocating a CPU vector but the vector is
not getting enabled/unmasked or the Local APIC is ignoring it.
Yeah, we don't want to be using irqpoll for this - entirely
defeats the purpose of MSI.
thanks,
