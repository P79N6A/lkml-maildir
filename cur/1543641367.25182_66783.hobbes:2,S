What is the accepted way to deal with Makefiles when building a module
that lives outside the kernel tree?  (I'm playing with kernel 2.4)
I thought that the answer was to:
    include /usr/src/linux/arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile
    include /usr/src/linux/Rules.make
in your makefile.  However, the arch/i386/Makefile (and a few others)
define some targets which wreak havoc with another project's Makefile
(in particular, the 'install' target).
It is absolutely necessary to include the arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile in order
to get the proper CFLAGS needed to build a kernel module, in an
arch-independent manner.  (for instance, alpha needs -ffixed-8 or gcc
will build a bad module, and other archs need similar things)
The ALSA project has a long block of configure magic which basically
duplicates the CFLAGS in arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile without including them,
but this is hardly desirable.
Looking through make.info I do not see a way to override all targets in
an included Makefile.
