Hi All,
I had a look at the NetBSD pciide.c driver and found this interesting
bit of code:
	/*
	 * Rev. <= 0x01 of the 3112 have a bug that can cause data
	 * corruption if DMA transfers cross an 8K boundary.  This is
	 * apparently hard to tickle, but we'll go ahead and play it
	 * safe.
	 */
	if (PCI_REVISION(pa->pa_class) <= 0x01) {
		sc->sc_dma_maxsegsz = 8192;
		sc->sc_dma_boundary = 8192;
	}
This is basically the same as setting hwif->rqsize to 15, but the NetBSD
folks apply the restriction only if the SiI3112 chipset revision is 1 or
lower. As I have a rev. 2 chip, I raised the rqsize to 128 and made some
disk intensive tests: kernel compilation while recursively copying some
huge (~400MB) files. A couple of hours later, my system remained stable
and getting transfers over 55MB/s with my 120GB Seagate. I'm running
2.4.22-ac1.
This silly patch makes the siimage driver to set rqsize to 15 only for
older, supposedly buggy chips, and leaves the default for the rest.
Regards,
Eduardo.
