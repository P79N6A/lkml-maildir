By default, every task has enough room for 32 gids.  If you need more than
32, it uses a dynamically allocated 2-d array, stored in blocks.  Always
use the GROUP_AT() macro, and you can treat it like a 1-d array.  I think
there is a hardlimit of 64k groups, but that is simply a #define that can
be changed.  You can have as many groups as you need, dynamically
allocated per-task, with CoW between tasks.  Sorted and bsearch()ed.
