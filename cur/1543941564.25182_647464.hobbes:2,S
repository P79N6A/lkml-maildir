You sent one message on this topic to me, back in Feb of 2007,
disagreeing that you could write a userspace USB driver running at full
speed in a non-racey manner.
Unfortunately, many other userspace USB drivers seem to disprove your
statement, including a number of vision systems running in military
applications (tanks running Linux!).  Perhaps this is just a matter of
using the api properly :)
I do know that the current usbfs interface is a major pain, hence the
work to create usbfs2.  I know those developers could use the help in
getting that cleaned up and into the kernel tree.
Also see the rapid development these days in wrappers around usbfs.
There is competing projects right now with OpenUSB and the
revitalization of the old libusb project.  I know those developers are
looking for examples where their new frameworks do not meet the needs of
developers for stuff exactly like you describe (lots of threads, async
callbacks, high throughput, cross-platform portability, etc.)

Again, I have asked for examples, and only received 2.  One (sound
driver) is totally not needed at all, as the kernel provides that
capability, and the other hasn't run in a modern distro for years.

It comes down to the simple fact, if you wish to use Linux, abide by the
license it comes under.  To do otherwise is both disenginous and
illegal[1].

See statement above about vision systems in tanks, it can, and is done
all the time...
If a company wants to keep a driver closed, then use another operating
system, it's not like there isn't other options out there.  I hear the
BSDs and Microsoft are quite comfortable with things like that.  :)

lawyers, and a number of other companies whom hold copyright on the
Linux kernel tree.  So it's not like this is a minority decision these
days...
