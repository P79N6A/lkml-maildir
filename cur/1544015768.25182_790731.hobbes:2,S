Apparently you have qualms with people who chose to reimplement the perl bits 
in one of the languages kernel developers already needed to know this time 
last year (shell, C, make).

I submitted a change, you insisted that I justify it to your satisfaction.  
That pretty much summarizes your participation in this thread.

Large additional dependencies without benefit are unreasonable.  My primary 
objection to perl is that it happens to be an additional large dependency 
without a correspondingly large benefit.
Your position is not internally consistent.  There was no need to scrutinize 
it when it went in, but there is a need to scrutinize patches reimplementing 
those bits without it.  You don't need the word "perl" in that sentence for 
your position to be a touch unbalanced.

I didn't say it was incapable of being supported.  We're _capable_ of 
reimplementing the entire kernel in perl except for a microkernel interpreter 
running on the bare metal.  Or cobol.  Sun spent some time trying to do one in 
Java a few years back.
"It can be done" and "It's a good idea" are two completely different criteria.

Stop getting so hung up on the word "perl".  Did you ever notice the _shipped 
files in the kernel so you don't have to have lex or yacc installed?  That's 
been kernel policy for how many years now?  The arguments about "dash vs bash" 
when reviewing the shell versions of these scripts are a similar impulse: 
trying to reduce unnecessary dependencies.
My first version of the timeconst patch didn't remove the perl script that 
generated the file, it simply shipped the pregenerated .h file so it was 
possible to _build_ without perl.  That was not sufficient for technical 
reasons (due to the two architectures that allow you to enter arbitrary 
values), so I redid the patch.
