After playing around with .4[234], I see problems in 43 and 44, but 42
seems fine.
(/usr/bin/nnrpd is the canary for me. Reboot into 43: crashes. Reboot
into 44: crashes. Reboot into 42: no problem. I've repeated this many
times in various orders. I now wonder if moving nnrpd around on the
disk would change things.)
But wouldn't TLB problems be intermittent, and tend to affect
everything rather than very speific programs? When I see a program
SIGSEGV unusually (sometimes it's SIGILL or SIGBUS), and md5sum on the
relevant binary, then reboot into a plain old 2.2 kernel, then md5sum
on the binary again, I get a different result! Unless the TLB changes
in 43 could plausibly cause these symptoms, aren't the changes to
fs/buffer.c a more likely culprit?
