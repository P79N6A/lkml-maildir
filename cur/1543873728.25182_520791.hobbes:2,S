I'm not quite familiar with the context.  And I'm to lazy to look right now.
What is the difference with COMPAT_VDSO that it doesn't do relocation?
What are we preserving?
The practical question here is if we already have all of the relocation logic
for the VDSO why do we need to add more?
I'm tempted to rant on the pure insanity of address space randomization but
that is a whole other issue...
