I think it's a mistake to interleave this data into the C source. It's
expensive and tedious to change relative to its volatility. What I was
proposing was something like, say, arch/i386/popularity.lst, which
would simply contain a list of the most popular n% of functions sorted
by popularity. As text, of course.
