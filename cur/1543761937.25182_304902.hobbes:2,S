I _think_ that answer means that my current code is fine in this respect.
But I'm not entirely convinced.  Since sparc64 is the only architecture
which implements a flush_tlb_pgtables which actually uses start,end,
we do need to suit your needs there - informed reassurance welcome!

Fine.  The patch I just sent, moving the tests, is how I'd like it to
be fixed finally, but what you've done in the interim should do fine.

And no way would your change be causing this.  Oh dear.

Seems so.  I did have an off-by-one originally,
but that version never leaked out.

Yes, odd.  I'll have to have another think later on.
