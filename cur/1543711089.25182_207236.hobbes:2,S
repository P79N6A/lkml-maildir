Stop right here.
Update to the latest 2.96 compiler or go to 3.x before proceeding.
I believe that one you have there has more bugs than a windows system.
Well.. Almost. The newer ones were good however but the early ones
weren't.
I'd recommend you install 3.2.x and try again but if you don't then
grab latest errata update to 2.96 and use that. Then if it still
doesn't work you can always ask here again.
