The changes to ad1848_detect made between 2.1.132 and 2.2.0-pre1 seem to
have broken things for me. What was previously detected as a CS4231 gets
detected as a CS4248, and some of the mixer settings are missing. I'm
going to try and fix it, but I thought someone else might have already
done it.
Soundcard is an opl3sa-something, which the newer opl3sa2.c doesn't like,
as it reports id=7. Currently I've hacked opl3sa2.c to think its an
opl3sax, and it seems to work. After I figure out what it really is I'll
send a patch.
later,
Andrew Kieschnick
