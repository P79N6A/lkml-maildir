I thought about that a little more...  I was thinking that devfs or the
driver could have a link to the above or something...

No it wasn't directories, they were files.  Ie: s0i0l0p0 would be first scsi
controller (I feel first found scsi controller is better than first found
drive) scsi id0 lun0 partition0.  s0i0l0 would be whole disk.  Something
like h0i0p0 would be for ide, but after thinking about it, hd[x] might be
better...  I dunno...  I'm just throughing ideas around.  I surely wouldn't
want something like
/devices/pcibus/slot1/scsi0/id0,lun0:a or something like that....  (I'm
thinking in sparc terms if you didn't know).
I really like the idea of solaris having this for scsi0 id0 lun0 partition0:
/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0  I just don't like the letters they used.
Above where I said bus[0-9], forget it, it would be too hard to do that and
it would be easier to have c0 and c1 being controller 0 bus 0 and controller
0 bus 1.  Whoever thought of /dev/sdb being 2nd found scsi hard drive should
be shot (IMO)  I thought about running that user space thing, but I don't
like the idea of it since the rootfs is mounted via /dev/sdx by the kernel. 
This is the exact reason I put my hard drives as close to id0 as possible
and all my other drives as close to id6 as possible.  if my cd changer goes
out, my burner goes from scd5 to scd0..  ouch!  I only have 1 tape drive in
this machine so that I'm not TOO worried about.  But I thought about this,
if I ever get a wide card, there's no way I'm putting a wide hdd on an id
less than 8.  This leaves enough room for all my narrow drives
Anyway, I don't feel it would be right to yank the /dev/sda out of the way
for people who like it, but it would be a nice config option...  Atleast
that would suit the people who love /dev/s{cd,da,t} and for those who can't
stand it..  Me I can live with it, but I don't like it...  Where's my choise
=)
(I'm kidding)
