But no messages from the time just before the BUG occurred.  :-(

After looking at the debugging output, no.  That "invalid opcode" is a red 
herring.  What you encountered this time was a BUG() in the source code of 
start_unlink_async() in drivers/usb/host/ehci-q.c:
#ifdef DEBUG
	assert_spin_locked(&ehci->lock);
	if (ehci->reclaim
			|| (qh->qh_state != QH_STATE_LINKED
				&& qh->qh_state != QH_STATE_UNLINK_WAIT)
			)
		BUG ();
#endif
You could try putting a printk() just before the BUG() to display the 
values of ehci->reclaim and qh->qh_state.  Maybe also change the BUG() to 
WARN(), which might help prevent your system from crashing so badly.
Monty has been making changes to this driver recently; maybe he has some 
ideas about the problem.
