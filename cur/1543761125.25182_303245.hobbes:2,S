Yes, the constraints on when children can be added/removed aren't
always useful.  In fact they can seem nastily arbitrary, and some
of them need careful workarounds elsewhere in USB.  The current
usbcore code should behave well in all common cases outside of
suspend/resume.  (Yes, it's routine to unplug USB devices when
the system is suspended.  That's not wholly worked around yet.
By the time World Domination is achieved, it'll be fixed!)

That was a FIXME that I added, and indeed it's now fixed.  The
patch had a dry run around 2.6.0 but had some issues, and they
took time to fix/test properly given more pressing issues.  The
drivers that used those APIs needed changes/retesting too.  :)

Those particular interfaces still exist even after Greg's patches
for the class support... he didn't change the physical device tree.
I tend to think the class support really does need to be treated
differently from the driver model core.  It's all sort of separate
anyway, since class devices aren't "real" ones.  They don't show up
in the physical device tree, and I understand the main reason to use
them is to mask that physical view behind a more "logical" view of
the hardware.  Keeping those views separate makes sense to me,
although I've not paid close attention to class device support.
