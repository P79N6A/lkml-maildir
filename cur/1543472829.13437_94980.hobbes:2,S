Hi Geert,
nice to see this.
Just let me add that moving the penguins to the right is not just because I
prefer right to left but to allow scrollback of boot messages even with
displayed logos. Yes, it works.

 There is  something  frustrating  about  the quality  and  speed  of  Linux
 development.  I.e. the quality  is too high  and the speed  is too high, in
 other words,  I  can implement  this XXXX feature,  but I bet  someone else
 has already done it and is just about to release his patch to Linus soon...
