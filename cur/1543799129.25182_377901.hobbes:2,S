To whomever is in charge of the sensors code in the kernel:
I just noted that the temperatures being reported by gkrellm, using its 
internal sensors stuff, are not correct by over 100F too low when -rc6 
is running.  -rc5 seems to give good readings consistent with what 
I've been observing for the last year, a slowly rising cpu reading due 
to the zallman flower becoming dust packed, to the point of about 150F 
for a normal reading.
Today, after rebooting to -rc6, I'm seeing cpu temps ranging between 
39.2 and 41.7 degress F. As the room is probably around 74F, thats a 
bit of a dubious reading.
Whom do I contact about this?
