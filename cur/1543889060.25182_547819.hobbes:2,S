The FS is 40GB and the log is 32768 blocks.  So, writing 2,000 blocks as
part of a checkpoint seems reasonable.  If you're whipping up a quick
and dirty patch to sort all the blocks being checkpointed, working in
bigger batches will increase the changes the writes are sequential.  So
I don't think smaller sub-transactions will do the trick.

I don't know the jbd code well enough, but it looks like it is putting
things down in the order they were logged.  So it should be possible,
but every FS is going to have a pathological worst case.  I'm actually
trying to tune the benchmark such that any bad performance is only from
allocator decisions and not writeback decisions.

Each tree is 222MB, plus metadata.  It works out to about 10GB when you
factor in space wasted due to partially used blocks.  writeback will be
somewhat sorted, well enough that file data seems to do down at 30MB/s
or so.  It's the metadata slowing things down.

128MB chunks would probably perform well, it isn't so much the size of
the group that helps but not having mixed data and metadata in the same
group.

It's an option, but not a light programming chore.

I would guess it'll score the same way.  The files are fairly small in
this dataset and ext4's jbd code is based on ext3.
