Hi,
We are currently running 2.4.18 (Marcelo) on a Dell PE4400 with
Perc3/DC and 2 on board adaptec controllers (two 7899 channels and one
7880).
On the first 7899 channel we have attached 2 Quantum DLT 7000 drives and a
BHTi Quad 7 changer, on the second there are another 2 Quantum DLT
7000 drives and a BHTi Q2 changer as well as the internal CDROM.
Now, what is happening is when we are initializing the JBs, the host
system will abruptly hang.  Turning on aic7xxx=verbose on the kernel
command line has given additional output, but still nothing solid as far
as trouble shooting information.  The only information I have been
able to get out of it has been:
scsi1:0:6:0: Attempting to queue an ABORT message
This is the stock 6.2.4 adaptec driver in 2.4.18 and with the 6.2.5 driver
under 2.4.18 (I've patched and tested this one today).  Attached are
kernel log segments of the information from boot to hang for 6.2.4 and
6.2.5 driver revisions...
Any information would be extreamly helpful.
TIA and regards,
James Bourne
