Nearly onbody has. However, you can download the latest kernel source
tarball, do your hacks and send us a patch to LKML. Then, you'll
possibly get some comments (better change this to do that, some
potential to do things better, ...). Send it again, until it's quite
good. Then, send it to Linus (or to the guy that's maintaining the part
you've changed) and LKML until it gets accepted.
That's the way it works.
MfG, JBG
