That's done, despite that I disagree with your line of argument (see below).

Nathan, you are ignoring the design of the inode operations: They are on 
purpose passing extended attributes by value. This is good as a kernel/user 
space interface, but inappropriate for passing around references to kernel 
internal structures. There is no further optimizing to be done behind that 
interface.
In the current design no filesystem independent part of the kernel would 
benefit from a faster interface except that one NFS hack. Since that appears 
to be no serious performance bottleneck and the hack will eventually go away 
using ->getxattr() seems acceptable.
As soon as any filesystem independent part of the kernel needs an interface 
more efficient that pass-by-value we will again have exactly the same 
problem.

I'm not sure if you have looked at how the [gs]et_posix_acl() operations are 
implemented for ext2/ext3/reiserfs/xfs. They are caching the ACLs per inode 
instead of repeatedly copying around the xattr values; permission() calls 
therefore are very efficient. XFS is the only exception; it always goes 
through the xattr interface and does not cache ACLs. I think XFS should also 
use caching, at least for ACL_TYPE_ACCESS ACLs.
Going to disk and fetching EAs only causes disk accesses once; afterwards the 
block is cached.

File system capabilities are in a different league that ACLs. They only need 
to be read once for each exec(), so going through the xattr interface is no 
problem at all. (In comparison, all ACLs along the path to a file are 
accessed whenever that file is accessed.)
Cheers,
Andreas.
