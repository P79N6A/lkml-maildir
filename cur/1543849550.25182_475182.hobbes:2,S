Actually, all the locking here is fine, that's why it checks
poll_owner for current smp_processor_id().
Otherwise it is safe to sit and spin waiting for link up/down or
TX full conditions to pass.

Not true, we should spin and retry for some reasonable amount of time.
That "reasonable amount of time" should be the maximum of the time
it takes to free up space from a TX full condition and the time it
takes to bring the link up.
That is what the current code is trying to do, and you've erroneously
deleted all of that logic.
