Yes, but we don't like to apply kernel hacks regardless if they "help"
embedded, desktop, server or anyone else.
Note that these tricks to limit file cache will only paper over the
actual issue, which is that large allocations must be contiguous and
thus subject to fragmentation on nommu kernels. The real solution to
this is simply not a kernel based one.
