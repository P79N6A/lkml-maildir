I saw the same thing happen with latest 2.2.14pre last night.
I mounted a vfat zip disk, copied files off it to hard disk, umount'd
the zip, ejected and then inserted another zip disk.
When I mounted it, there appeared to be no files on it,
but the output from df shows 95% used.
umounting the disk brought up the message above..
The zip disks are fine in another machine using 2.2.13
They also appear fine in 2.2.14 when viewed with mtools.
regards,
Dave.
