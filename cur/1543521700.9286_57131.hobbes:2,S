Until you write it to file or send it across a network
and it is used by a machine with a different value of
epoch_t.
People will have to alter code to write both time_t and
epoch_t to files with persistence or in network protocols.
I can't see that this is superior to changing the base
type of time_t during a future move to ISO C9x.
