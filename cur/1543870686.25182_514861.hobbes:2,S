What ibm-acpi backlight control does is *very* different from what the
radeon backlight control does.
ibm-acpi talks to the ThinkPad EC to change the brightness of the backlight,
it has *NO* on/off support.  Radeon talks to the video chipset to turn the
LVDS output on/off (or something to that effect), and thus to turn the
backlight on/off.
