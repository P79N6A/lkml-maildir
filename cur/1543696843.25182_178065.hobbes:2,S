The point. You got one major o/s project hosted on bk when you ought to have 
them all. Loads more developers using bk at home means loads more demanding 
it at work.
And all it would take is a lobotomised, redistributable, license free client 
so anyone can pull o/s software from bk repos.
And, for the record, you'd be a hungry fool if you GPLed bk.
