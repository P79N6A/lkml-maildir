Hi, while configuring 2.5.40, I attempted to enter the "Advanced Linux Sound Architecture" section, sub-section of Sound, it died with the following output.
=======================================================================
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> ./scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu74: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
[root@anduril][/usr/src/linux]$ 
=====================================================================
Regards
Colin Stubbs
