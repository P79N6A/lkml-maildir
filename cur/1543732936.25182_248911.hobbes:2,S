I tried it with a full build of a BK tree pulled last night, and it
definitely didn't work.  Some relevant output:
    tg3.c:v3.9 (August 30, 2004)
    eth0: Tigon3 [partno(none) rev 2003 PHY(serdes)] (PCIX:133MHz:64-bit) 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet 00:0d:60:1e:88:56
    eth0: HostTXDS[1] RXcsums[1] LinkChgREG[0] MIirq[0] ASF[1] Split[0] WireSpeed[1] TSOcap[0]
    eth1: Tigon3 [partno(none) rev 2003 PHY(serdes)] (PCIX:133MHz:64-bit) 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet 00:0d:60:1e:88:57
    eth1: HostTXDS[1] RXcsums[1] LinkChgREG[0] MIirq[0] ASF[0] Split[0] WireSpeed[1] TSOcap[1]
and then as soon as the init scripts try to bring up the interface:
    Setting up network interfaces:
        lo
        lo        IP address: 127.0.0.1/8                                 done
        dummy0
        dummy0    No configuration found for dummy0                       unused
        eth0      device: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5
    system>
    system> console -T system:blade[11]
    SOL is not ready
(the last three lines are the management console taking over again
after the serial-over-LAN has died)
Just to be clear, I'm running a ppc64 kernel on a JS20 blade (dual PPC
970) with BCM5704S.  The HS20 blade (dual Xeon) also has a BCM5703X
but I haven't tried the latest driver on one of those yet.
Thanks,
  Roland
