At least on i386/x86-64 it is largely used for hardware/firmware bug 
workaround and these have been traditionally always compiled in
Or do you want to spend a lot of time on a bug report from
a user only to discover they didn't enable the workarounds for
their particular platform?
You might not need that right now but I can predict that 
at some point you'll need board specific workarounds - and
then it will be very useful to have.

Well, i suppose it will be more common in the future. Perhaps
get over that particular hatered?
