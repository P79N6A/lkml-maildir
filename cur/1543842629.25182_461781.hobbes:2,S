Changing the device order in the middle of the 2.6 cycle doesn't sound
like a sane idea to me. Many people have changed their systems' configuration
to adapt to the 2.6 ordering and this patch would break their setups.
I have seen many such examples in my vicinity.
I believe that not breaking existing 2.6 setups is much more important
than keeping compatibility with 2.4 kernels, especially when the problem
is discovered after more than 2 years after release of the first 2.6.
				Have a nice fortnight
