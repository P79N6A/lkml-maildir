Well, the problems I have (had; I'll get to that) are:
* Hard lockup whenever you try to access an USB audio device
* Sudden reboot sometimes when streaming video from an USB webcam.
The first problem appeared in 2.4.3 and only on SMP, but I know work around
that by using the alternate UHCI driver which seems to work well so far. The
second problem persists, but that is probably just a bug in the camera
driver. Nevertheless, all USB devices I tried on { SMP, kernel >2.4.3,
non-alternate UHCI driver } failed, so my statement was correct. :)
Since the alternate UHCI driver works I am satisified, but perhaps someone
interested in the normal driver should look into what happened between 2.4.3
and 2.4.4.
