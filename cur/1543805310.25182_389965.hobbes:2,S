I thought test_bit can operate on array beyond unsigned long.
It's perfectly legitimate to do: test_bit(999, bit_array) as
long as bit_array is indeed big enough to hold 999 bits.  It
is the responsibility of the caller to make sure that the
underlying array is big enough for the bit that is being tested.
I don't think you need to change the flags size.
