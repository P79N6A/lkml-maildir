2. from pm.txt
  "If a working ACPI implementation is found, the
ACPI driver will override and disable APM, otherwise the APM driver
will be used."
What is meant here by -working-
3. Does anybody have acpi working to their advantage?
4. What does DSDT stand for?
5. Do any of the above error msgs make sense to anybody.
6. Is there any *real* advantage to acpi vs apm?
7. Has it been implemented in *any* drivers?
