It's a statement about the deadlock detection which is true, it's not a
negative comment. A negative comment would be something ala "the
deadlock detection code is crap". Note, to avoid further confusion in
this thread: I have not read the deadlock detection code, nor do I
intend to. The sentence is only an example of what a negative comment
would look like, in no way does it reflect my view of the deadlock
detection code. End disclaimer.
As I said, I have no personal motivation to work on the deadlock
detection. My interest in the thread pertained only to code in the
kernel and its use of semaphores - something that we already cleared up
many mails ago.
So, please, lets just end it here. This branch of the thread has already
dragged on for way too long.
