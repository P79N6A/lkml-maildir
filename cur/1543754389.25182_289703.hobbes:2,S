LSI would leave no stone unturned to make the performance better for
megaraid controllers under Linux. If you have some hard data in relation to
comparison of performance for adapters from other vendors, please share with
us. We would definitely strive to better it.
The megaraid driver is open source, do you see anything that driver can do
to improve performance. We would greatly appreciate any feedback in this
regard and definitely incorporate in the driver. The FW under Linux and
windows is same, so I do not see how the megaraid stack should perform
differently under Linux and windows?
