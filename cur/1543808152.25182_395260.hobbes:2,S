Sigh. Can everyone please stop assuming gcc can output to /dev/null? On 
several platforms, ld tries to lseek in the output file, and fails if it 
can't.
Is there any reason this problem can't be solved the same way it is
for libcurses in menuconfig, by using gcc -print-filename? Or perhaps
using tempfile?
Cheers,
