Well, it's not sending the patches that's the hard part. :) It's getting to
the point where you're feeling a 100% confident that the code is a 100% 
correct and without side effects that is. And since I'm so inexperienced in
kernel programming getting to that point simply involves reading just
lots and lots of code, and hence ends up taking a lot of time...
But enough about that. :)

So, yeah, it was on the device and your version is obviously better. It
does, however, have one little "problem" in common with mine:
Plug in GPS.

I'll do that.
