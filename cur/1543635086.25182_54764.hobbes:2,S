Do you or anyone happen to know if this firmware update fixes UDMA problems
with the drive (i.e. I can't use the drive on my HTP366 cause it'll lock up
the machine). I'm wondering if the firmware also addresses the issues that
caused the drive to be listed in the DMA blacklist.
Also I tried going to page earlier and wasn't able to get to it because of a
bandwidth threshold. I've since gotten through and mirrored the site to
