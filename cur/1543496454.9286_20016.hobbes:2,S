You don't even need that, as Linux doesn't care what the BIOS
supports. All that matters is that the contents of /boot are all
located within the first 1023 cylinders, and I normally ensure this by
making /boot a separate partition corresponding to the first ~16M of
the primary hard drive, as follows:
 Q> # fdisk -l /dev/hda
 Q> Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 623 cylinders
 Q> Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

 Q> /dev/hda1   *         1        2    16033   83  Linux native

Note that the reason for splitting /dev/hda5 and /dev/hda6 into two
partitions was to avoid problems connected with the 2G limit, and I
chose to use two partitions smaller than that limit rather than one
partition larger than it.
Best wishes from Riley.
