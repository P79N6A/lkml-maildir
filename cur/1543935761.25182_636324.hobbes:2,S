Actually, Blackfin BF54x on-chip SDIO host controller is supposed to
support 1-bit and 4-bit MMC or SD. But in the real platform, when MMC
works at 4-bit mode there will be a FIFO underrun error
(
http://blackfin.uclinux.org/gf/project/uclinux-dist/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&tracker_item_id=3535
).
While SD works at 4-bit mode is OK. We believe this is a hardware
issue of the SDIO host controller of BF54x.
We intend to workaround in our own BF54x SDIO host controller driver,
but there is no place for us to determine MMC or SD. One choice is to
hack common code like this:

Another choice is to use Mike's patch to split the 4-bit mode into
MMC-4-BIT and SD-4-BIT. So we can support 1-bit and 4-bit SD as well
as 1-bit MMC.
