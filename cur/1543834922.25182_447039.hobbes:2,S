we'd also need a facility to wait on that refcount - i.e. a waitqueue. 
Which means we'd have a "refcount + waitqueue", which is equivalent to a 
"recursive, sleeping read-lock", where the write-side could be used as a 
simple facility to "wait for all readers to go away and block new 
readers from entering the critical sections". [which type of lock Linux 
does not have right now. rwsems come the closest but they dont recurse.]
Also, the hotplug lock is global right now which is pretty unscalable, 
so the rw-mutex should also be per-CPU, and the hotplug locking API 
should be changed to something like:
	cpu = cpu_hotplug_lock();
	...
	cpu_hotplug_unlock(cpu);
To enable a task to schedule away (and potentially migrate to another 
CPU) with the per-CPU lock held but still be able to unlock the right 
per-cpu lock. [this above approach is quite similar to how we do 
sleeping per-cpu locks in -rt.]
