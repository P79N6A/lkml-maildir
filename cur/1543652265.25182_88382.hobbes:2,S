It'd be nice if you specified which kind of workloads. Generic
handwaving is easy, but if you think about this problem a bit
more you'll see that most workloads which look like they might
suffer at first view should be just fine in reality...

Note that async-IO shouldn't make a big difference here, except
maybe in synthetic benchmarks.
This is because the stream of data in a server will be approximately
the same regardless of whether the application is coded to use async
IO, threads or processes and because clients still need to wait for
the data on read while most writes are asynchronous.
