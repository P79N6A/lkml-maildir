	Not too interesting - most of these calls simply disappeared in
2.4.0-test. pcmcia ones didn't, though. That subsystem is still not fixed.
Ditto for ATM and net devices.

Hmm... No comments on these.
Thanks for pointing to the ATM stuff - looks like they are also worth
shifting the refcounting into callers.
It would be great if you would run your tools over the recent 2.4.0-test -
_many_ things had changed in that area.
