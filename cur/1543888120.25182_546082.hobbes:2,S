Subject: [PATCH] Fix roundup_pow_of_two(1)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/18/74

Fix roundup_pow_of_two(1)
1 is a power of two, therefore roundup_pow_of_two(1) should return 1. It does
in case the argument is a variable but in case it's a constant it behaves
wrong and returns 0. Probably nobody ever did it so this was never noticed.
