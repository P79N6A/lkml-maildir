Hi,
I've recently installed the 2.4.21 kernel. But with this version I
don't have sound. That is, sound coming from the CD is played, but
all other isn't.
I don't know how I can help you discover the problem, so I'm asking
some assistance to better report the problem.
For now I'll show you what is returned when I install the modules:
i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 2 channels.
i810_audio: Defaulting to base 2 channel mode.   
i810_audio: Resetting connection 0
ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: CMI65 (CMedia)
AC97 codec does not have proper volume support.  
i810_audio: only 48Khz playback available.
i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 Unable to map surround DAC's (or DAC's not present), total channels = 2
The 5th line didn't appear before....
Thanks,
---
