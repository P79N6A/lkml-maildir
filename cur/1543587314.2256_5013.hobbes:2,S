Granted.  If, that is, the representation you generate supports that kind
of backtracking.  This turns out to be very hard if you're starting from
an imperative representation rather than a declarative one.  
But, as a separate issue, the CML2 design *could* be reworked to support
a multiple-apex tree, if there were any advantage to doing so.  I don't
see one.  Do you?

Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of
authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was
made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions. There
are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to
govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.
