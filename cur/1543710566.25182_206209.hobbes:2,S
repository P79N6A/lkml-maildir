Could you perhaps describe which architecture this is a problem on, and 
what its entry condition looks like?

I removed it because I removed the VISWS dependency, thus making it 
redundant.  What you seem to be saying is that the dependency should 
have been on SMP not X86_SMP; if that's the issue then please make it so.
I think you just needed to apply your own rule to the above statement.

It doesn't anymore.  The only reason it did was because of stupid 
partitioning between head.S and trampoline.S, which the patch cleans up.
