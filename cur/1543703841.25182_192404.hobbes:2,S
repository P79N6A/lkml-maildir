THAT is where the hardware designer went wrong.  An interrupt is really the best 
way for hardware to notify the cpu of an event.  Details may then be read from 
hardware registers, if needed.
The request of a 0 timeout is really asking for a timeout on the last jiffie.  I 
suspect that relying on this to actually not happen until the next jiffie is NOT 
a good thing.  I am not aware of any spec that says that is what it should do 
and I am aware of timer patchs that will run the timer immeadiatly.  A request 
for 1 jiffie will do the same thing in the current kernel AND under that patch. 
  That thing being, by the way, is to wait for the next jiffie which will be any 
time from ~0 to 1 jiffie.

Lots of words, which did not explain why an interrupt was not used to signal the 
event, deleted :)
