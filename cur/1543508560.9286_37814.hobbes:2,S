Subject: New info on 2.3.13-17 no boot on i486 (memory detect?)

FYI:
Have a '93 vintage i486 (bios same) which has not been able to boot
since 2.3.12.  Displays 'Ok, booting the kernel' and nothing more.
Have 36M physical RAM but limit to 32M with the lilo
mem=32M directive because performance goes south above 32M.
Have been using a bzImage. (487.4-525.5K)
Removing the lilo mem directive allows the system to boot.
Built a stripped zImage using 2.3.17 (392.6k) this evening and the 
zImage boots with the lilo mem=32M directive.
System has 128K shadow ram which cannot be disabled. I don't know any
better but would assume that the shadow ram is at fault here?
Glad to assist if anyone would like to fix. Otherwise, will go with
the zImage and modules work around.
