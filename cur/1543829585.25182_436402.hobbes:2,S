I think this would meet our needs--we (MVFS) need to initialize some new
state in a child process based on our state in the parent process
(essentially, module-private inherited per-process state).  It may still
be a bit clumsy to find the per-process state in other situations,
though.  While a process is executing our module's code, would it be
safe to traverse current's notifier chain to find our state?
