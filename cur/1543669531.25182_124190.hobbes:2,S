I try to make sure there are no assumptions about the
size or structure of device numbers anywhere outside kdev_t.h.
In particular I object to the use of KDEV_MINOR_BITS.
Apart from this formal point, there is also the practical point:
suppose 64 = 32+32 is used, so that KDEV_MINOR_BITS equals 32.
Then LAST_MAJOR_DISKS is 2^28 and sd_index_bits[] would be 32 MB array.
Unreasonable.
The conclusion is that the easy way out is to define MAX_NR_DISKS.
A different way out, especially when we use 32+32, is to kill this
sd_index_bits[] array, and give each disk a new number: replace
	index = find_first_zero_bit(sd_index_bits, SD_DISKS);
by
	index = next_index++;
