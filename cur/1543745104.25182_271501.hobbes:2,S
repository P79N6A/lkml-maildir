OK, another part of my standard build script (which is now failing to
boot) includes:
#
# Character devices
#
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_SERIAL_NONSTANDARD=y
# CONFIG_COMPUTONE is not set
...

No, the standard (old) kernel that comes with Fedora Core 3 is working
ok, but I prefer to run my own custom kernels.  The official Fedora line
is that it's wrong to build your own kernel, and you are silly for
wanting to do so, but I like to build/run them anyway.

Thanks for your reply though.  Your question as to whether /dev/console
exists at boot time is making me question whether /dev/console exists at
boot time.
