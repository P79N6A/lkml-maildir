Subject: Can and should the kernel HZ value be changed?

The default value of HZ is 100hz.  Since the DEF_PRIORITY in sched.h is 20, that
means a processor intensive process gets a maximum of 200ms or 1/5th of a
second.  Two intensive processes can hog the processor for 0.4 seconds and so
on.  That's a long time when one is running multimedia apps, games, or burning a
CD.  I presume that there are good reasons to keep HZ at it's present value, but
I'd like to find out more about it.  Can anyone point me to more information or
perhaps a previous discussion of this subject?
Thanks,
Steve
