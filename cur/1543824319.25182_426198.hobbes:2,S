Subject: i386 Kconfig options out of order

Options NUMA and EFI in arch/i386/Kconfig depend on ACPI but they
appear before the ACPI option.  make oldconfig with no initial setting
for CONFIG_ACPI will prompt for these options, but if you then say No
to CONFIG_ACPI the options will silently be turned off.  Conversely if
you turn on CONFIG_ACPI you do not get prompted for the options that
are out of order.
