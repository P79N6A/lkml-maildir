Hi!
The following four patches improve the ACPI C-States handling. The first
three ones are independent of dynticks.
Len, please take a look at the first three patches, and if you think they're
correct, please merge them.
Con, regarding your dyn-tick patches: please remove the two patches from your
patchset which touch drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c and
include/acpi/processor.h, and replace them with these updated versions.
Thanks!
	Dominik
