For MWI, it will cause data corruption.  For READ LINE and MULTIPLE, I 
think it would be okay.  The memory is prefetchable after all.  Anyways, 
this shouldn't be of too much problem and probably can be handled by 
quirks if ever needed.

Oh yeah, that's what I was trying to say, and I don't want to go down 
that route.  So, I guess this one is settled.
Thanks.
