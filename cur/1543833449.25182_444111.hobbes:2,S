Doing core-dumping in user space would be insane. It doesn't give _any_ 
advantages, only disadvantages.
Why do people keep thinking that doing things in user space is "safer" and 
"easier". It's quite often not. For example, all the "fragile" stuff would 
be true for a user-space dumper (don't tell me it's safer - it would 
obviously have to run with elevated capabilities), and a lot of it would 
be a hell of a lot harder.
