Replying to my own mail.  Solution 2 would not work, depmod can be run
before the kernel is booted so it is not guaranteed to have access to
exported symbols in the kernel that goes with the module.  The value of
ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS must be available in the module that uses struct
isapnp_card_id or in the System.map.  Go with solution 1.
