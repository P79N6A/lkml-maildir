I agree, with an appropriate fix to recalc_sigpending_tsk() to only
clear TIF_SIGPENDING if tsk == current (the patch Linus posted
basically) _along_ with a fix to avoid the notifier thingy if stealing
from another task, that would work.

I agree there too. I don't see the point of the 'feature' of allowing
those to be stolen and can only lead into all sort of new headaches
nobody needs.

Heh, well, as you say later, it can't be delivered anyway... I don't
think we need to do anything explicit to prevent them from being read()
in signalfd, it will just not happen.
