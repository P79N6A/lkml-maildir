It appeared to me a generic issue though I believe a number
of solutions are possible.  asm-generic/tlb.h:tlb_gather_mmu()
expands to linux/percpu.h:get_cpu_var() which does a
preempt_disable() and __get_cpu_var().  This caused the debug
assertion to kick when __page_cache_release() and to a lesser
extent activate_page() attempted to block on a mutex (though
other paths may well exist).  My approach was to replace the
outer layer preempt_disable/enable calls with a mutex-spinlock.
The fix was fairly easy once it was known from where the
gratuitous call to preempt_disable() existed.  I cobbled
together a logging mechanism which detected the problem.  As it
wasn't very general I removed it from the patch.  I didn't see
an alternate means of diagnosing such a scenario so I'll likely
address generalizing the code.
