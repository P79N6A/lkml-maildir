Hi,
i have two servers with performance-problems since the last update to
2.4.23.
In the meanwhile i have the following informations from the first
server:
CPU:
model name      : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.40GHz
After a fresh Reboot with the old Kernel, 2.4.22 (there is nobody beside
me logged in), the Apache takes exact 5 Seconds CPU time until the first
child is started.
After a fresh Reboot with the new Kernel, the Apache takes 60-70 Seconds
CPU time until the first child is started.
I took the .config-file from 2.4.22 to compile the 2.4.23.
I have selected P4 and 386, it didn't changed anything.
Where can be the problem?
Are there others with the same problem?
The second server has a Duron-CPU, but the same problem.
Regards,
Ralf Dreibrodt
