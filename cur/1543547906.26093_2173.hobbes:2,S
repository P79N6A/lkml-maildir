I'm trying to compile 2.2.17 with gcc 2.96, and it shows a lot of
warnings like this in several files.
warning: pasting would not give a valid preprocessing token
And fails to compile with the error:
checksum.S:231: badly punctuated parameter list in #define
It's the update to gcc2.96 causing this problems?? How can i get to
compile the kernel?
