First of all, there is ->read_super() side of the things.  If it fails
after iget() on root, we have nothing to kick inode out of cache.  And
no, we can't call invalidate_inodes() here - too late for calling any
methods.
What's more, for stuff like inodes held by superblock (e.g. fs keeping
block bitmaps in a file - in that case the earliest point that _can_
do iput() on that sucker is ->put_super(); ditto for $BIGNUM similar
cases - journal, other fs structures of that kind - ACLs, etc., etc.)
we get final iput() _after_ invalidate_inodes().  And doing anything
after ->put_super() is again too late.
IOW, we can kick inode out of icache only between successful ->read_super()
and ->put_super().  Any iput() done outside of that range must go immediately
and yes, such cases are not only possible but actually exist.
