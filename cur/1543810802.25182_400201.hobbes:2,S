Actually, we know what's present as soon as a bus reset completes, which
is measured in microseconds (1394a) or 300ms at worst (1394-1995.)
There is the case of a device that has to boot and isn't initially
available, but it will issue a reset when it comes online and our
subsystem will do detection again if needed.
