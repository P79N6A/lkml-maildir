Actually, no, you need to check 2.5.53 Justin.  Your latest stuff (6.2.24 
or thereabouts I think) has been sucked in and several of the "It breaks 
in 2.5.53" reports that have floated through linux-scsi in the last week 
are in fact about that specific version of the driver.  From the Changelog 
of 2.5.53:
<gibbs@overdrive.btc.adaptec.com>
	Update to aic7xxx 6.2.22 and aic79xx 1.3.0_ALPHA2
<gibbs@overdrive.btc.adaptec.com>
	Remove generated file.
<gibbs@overdrive.btc.adaptec.com>
	Enable highmem_io.
<gibbs@overdrive.btc.adaptec.com>
	o Kill host template files.
	o Move readme files into the Documentation SCSI directory
	o Enable highmem_io
	o Split out Kconfig files for aic7xxx and aic79xx
	Host template and large disk changes provided or inspired by:
		Christoph Hellwig <hch@sgi.com>
<gibbs@overdrive.btc.adaptec.com>
	Complete the upgrade to aic7xxx 6.2.23 and aic79xx 1.3.0_ALPHA3.
<gibbs@overdrive.btc.adaptec.com>
	Update to aic7xxx version 6.2.24 and aic79xx version 1.3.0_ALPHA5.
So, in short, your going to have to change your autoresponse to 2.5 
kernels now because Linus bit the bullet and grabbed your tree.
