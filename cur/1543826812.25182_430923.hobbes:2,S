Currently there are two uses of this API.
The first user is the code that provides inotify support to userspace,
which lives in inotify_user.c in this patch.
The second user is an audit patch which provides path-based rules via
inotify directory events.  An inotify kernel API allows audit to take
advantage of inotify's hooks, list management, and inode removal
handling, instead of duplicating that functionality.
I'll send the audit patch in a new thread.
