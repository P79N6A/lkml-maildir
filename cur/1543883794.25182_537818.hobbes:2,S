Followup: I reran with sd-0.46, setting rr_interval to 40, and then 5 
(default was 16). Neither appeared to give a useful video playback. I 
did try setting the make to nice 10, and that made the playback 
perfectly smooth, as well as response to skip forward and volume change 
happening when the key was pressed instead of eventually.
I also tried raising the nice of X to -10, that made things better on 
display, but I winder if it will let X run ahead of the nice-0 raid threads.
Is this my hardware or is there a really odd behavior here? The sd seems 
to be too fair to cope well with this realistic load, and expecting 
users to nice things is probably morally correct but unrealistic.
