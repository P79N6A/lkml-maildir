Note the usb sound driver does that same thing even on a UP box (with 
SMP kernel and UP kernel)
I've tried to debug the problem but setting nmi_watchdog=1 at boot time 
does seem
to catch the problem so I don't have much to go on.
If you haven't set nmi_watchdog yet you may want to try it and see if 
you have
better luck.
And yes comfirmed 2.4.3 works 2.4.[45678] does not.
