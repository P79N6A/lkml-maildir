Hi Andrew!
The change from 
	EXPORT_SYMBOL
to
	EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
for class_simple_* makes the nvidia module useless as it uses several:
nvidia: Unknown symbol class_simple_device_add
nvidia: Unknown symbol class_simple_destroy
nvidia: Unknown symbol class_simple_device_remove
nvidia: Unknown symbol class_simple_create
I don't want to start a flame war and long discussion, just want to ask
wether this change (to _GPL) was intended, and if yes, if there is a way
to fix nvidia kernel modules (or others) using this device management
interface.
Best wishes
Norbert
