You've made your point, here and elsewhere.
Both parties involved disagree. I suggest
you spend your efforts elsewhere:
OpenBSD should merge with NetBSD.
XEmacs should merge with GNU Emacs.
CinePaint should merge with The Gimp.
Windows should merge with OS/2.
After you solve those problems, you can
tackle projects that aren't truly forks.
For example, we only need one editor.
