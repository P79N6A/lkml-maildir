Aren't you forgetting about CPUfreq governors? Which mean: use the 
maximum CPU frequency when the system is busy, throttle down (or lower 
voltage) when the system is idle.
So yes, throttling will save the battery.
Besides, not all CPUs support power management (voltage control).

And for reducing power on CPUs that can't do any power management, just 
throttling.
For example, a server that doesn't crunch any numbers at night will 
certainly use less power when throttled.
