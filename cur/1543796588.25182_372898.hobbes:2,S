I have to use the 2.4.18 kernel because We use an
application which is build on this kernel.
The module are the next one (lsmod):
Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
wdpiano                 1920   0  (unused)

jbd                    49400   2  [ext3]
The kernel is (uname) :
Linux Republique_ncl_a 2.4.18-3 #1 Thu Apr 18 07:37:53
EDT 2002 i686 unknown
Zine.
