I can't get this to happen at all.  2.2.1/msdos, 2.2.1-ac6/msdos,
2.2.1-ac6/ext2.  It just says "No space left on device" for me.  Here's
what I'm trying:
modprobe ppa
mkfs.ext2 /dev/sda4
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt
dd if=/dev/zero of=zeros bs=1024 count=10240
for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do cp -v zeros /mnt/$n; done
I'm using EPP 32-bit mode, if that's likely to make a difference.
I _have_ had crashes when reading from the Zip drive (with a vfat fs), but
only about twice ever.  I'm still hunting for that one.  The most recent
time that happened was with 2.2.1, so it's still there.
Tim.
