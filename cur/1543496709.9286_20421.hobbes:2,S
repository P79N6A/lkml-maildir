Um...last I checked Linus Torvalds did hold the trademark on the world
Linux when pertaining to the kernel known as Linux.  There was some smuck
who tried to do this in the U.S. Eventually he did back down.  And so
Linus does have a trademark on it.

I'm not quite sure there is such a thing as an "international trademark".
Also I am not sure if the Berne Convention covers trademarks(I think it
might but I could be wrong, maybe there is some other treaty that covers
trademarks??)
