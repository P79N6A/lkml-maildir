That could be easily extended if needed. But I don't see why we would
need that much setup data anyways. Limiting it to let's say 16KB
seems entirely reasonable. And if some kernel ever needs more it can 
be still extended.
The biggest item is probably the command line and i don't see why
that should be more than a one or two KB.

That will be all freed and again the data shouldn't be that big.
