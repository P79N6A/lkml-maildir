No, a one-line patch adding the module to the set is all they'd see.  There's 
no reason to think this will cause more review.

Then mark those symbols internal and only allow concurrently-built modules to 
access them.  That's simpler and requires much less maintenance than your 
solution.

So in your head you have a notion of a kernel API, and you're trying to make 
that API explicit in the code.
Sorry, but no.
