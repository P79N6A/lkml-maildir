Hi,
It seems BH_Req is set on a buffer_head by submit_bh.
What part of the code unsets this flag during normal
operations? One path seems to be block_flushpage->unmap_buffer
->clear_bit(BH_Req), but IIRC block_flushpage is used only
for truncates. There must be another path to unset BH_Req
under normal memory pressure, or (more unambiguously) on IO completion.
So: in what ways can BH_Req be unset?
Thanks for any input, i've been staring at the code for long without avail ...
cheers,
ananth.
PS: In case why the question: I've got a system with tons of
pages with buffers marked BH_Req, so try_to_free_buffers() bails
out thinking that the buffer is busy ...
