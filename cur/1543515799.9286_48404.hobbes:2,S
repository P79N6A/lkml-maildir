Hi,
  I need to write a certain function in /usr/src/linux/mm/filemap.c which
references a lot of functions distributed over /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4.
Can anybody suggests what are the changes I need to make in the Makefile
in each of ths subdirectories and that in the main Makefile ?
Thanks,
Koushik
