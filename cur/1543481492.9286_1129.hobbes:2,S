oh...
Well is there any effort currently underway to document them?
If not, is there a desire to have better docs?  I would think
there would be...
(hmmm... thinking I may have just voleentered :)
well, I'm porting some code that will be needing ioctls to linux over
the next few months.  I'll start docs on the ones I use, and if people
think it is a good idea, I may try starting up an effort to document
all of them (or at least the most common ones)
