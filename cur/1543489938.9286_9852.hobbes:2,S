Hello James,
You may be interested in the new LLC layer for Linux, it is not integrated
into the standard Linux kernel, but will be once testing is finished. It
includes good support for LLC type 1 and type 2.
You can pick it up at ftp.linux-sna.org, it is included in the standard
Linux-SNA distribution, so you will need to grab the whole patch.
I would be glad to see some one test it. Writting a NetBeui layer for the
new LLC layer should be a rather less painful chore than using the LLC in
the kernel now.
Feel free to contact me if you would like more information.
