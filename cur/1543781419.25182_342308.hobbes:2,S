i've released the 2.6.13-rc6-rt1 tree, which can be downloaded from the 
usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
as the name already suggests, i've switched to a new, simplified naming 
scheme, which follows the usual naming convention of trees tracking the 
mainline kernel. The numbering will be restarted for every new upstream 
kernel the -RT tree is merged to.
the 2.6.13-rc6-rt1 release includes a number of fixes. Changes since 
-53-11:
 - more HRT fixes (Thomas Gleixner)
 - more RCU-tasklist-lock fixes (Paul E. McKenney)
 - IPC message-queue and IPC messages wakeup fixes (Daniel Walker)
 - VIA VT8237 southbridge quirks to fix IOAPIC issues (Karsten Wiese)
 - NMI preemption-count fix (George Anzinger)
 - various latency tracer fixes: lost trace entries, SMP weirdnesses (me)
to build a 2.6.13-rc6-rt1 tree, the following patches should to be 
applied:
