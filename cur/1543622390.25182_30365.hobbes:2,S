Is there work being done on a filesystem extension that allows admins to
'undelete' files similar to the way Netware does? My company uses Netware
only for that fact, and I would like to see more Linux boxes here. I have
sold them on a couple of webservers and one application server, but they
hold fast to the Netware file servers because loading a backup copy of some
file from tape is not feasable with the amount of data we have (approaching
1T). I have looked across the web and only found this:
http://www.timpanogas.com/
but I don't want a Netware filesystem running on Linux, I want a *native*
Linux filesystem (i.e. ext3) that has the ability to queue deleted files
should I configure it to. Is there such a thing? If not, do you feel it
would be worth developing into the kernel? This would make Linux much more
attractive to Netware houses I believe.

Known problem.  Apparently difficult to fix, unfortunately.  It's not so
much that ext2 adds deleted inodes to a list, as that it simply marks the
inode "deleted" and doesn't overwrite any of the inode data on the disk.
