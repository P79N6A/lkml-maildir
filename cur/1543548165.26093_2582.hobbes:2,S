Subject: Compilation failure on Alpha with test8-pre[2-6]

While attempting to compile the 2.4.0test8-pre series on Alpha, I ran into
the following problem in the drivers/block/xor.c modifications:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/src/kernel/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8 -mcpu=ev5 -Wa,-mev6
-fno-strict-aliasing -DMODULE   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c xor.c
xor.c: In function `xor_block_alpha':
xor.c:1791: inconsistent operand constraints in an `asm'
xor.c: In function `xor_block_alpha_prefetch':
xor.c:2213: inconsistent operand constraints in an `asm'
I can supply my .config if needed, but the only relevant thing I can think
of is that I got the same problem with the 'generic' and 'sx164' machine
types (and even that isn't terribly relevant since the #ifdef is just
__alpha__).
I had other problems with test8-pre1, but I'm still working on a patch for
those and making sure that they weren't already handled in later test8-pre
patches.
