if using you patch, the
"synchronized TSC with CPU" never come out.
then with your patch, I add back patch that moving set callin_map from
smp_callin to start_secondary. It told me can not inquire the apic for
the CPU 1....2....

Initializing CPU#1
masked ExtINT on CPU#1
Calibrating delay using timer specific routine.. 3600.30 BogoMIPS (lpj=7200601)
CPU: L1 I Cache: 64K (64 bytes/line), D cache 64K (64 bytes/line)
CPU: L2 Cache: 1024K (64 bytes/line)
CPU 1(2) -> Node 0 -> Core 1
 stepping 02
CPU 1: Syncing TSC to CPU 0.
CPU 1: synchronized TSC with CPU 0 (last diff 0 cycles, maxerr 1415 cycles)
