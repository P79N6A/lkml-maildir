This is re-send of cleanups which where acked by Paul.
Patches 1-2 are unchanged and already applied to the git tree,
I am re-sending them just in case.
"[PATCH 3/3] rcu: join rcu_ctrlblk and rcu_state" was updated
to match kernel.org/git/, the only change is
-	____cacheline_maxaligned_in_smp
+	____cacheline_internodealigned_in_smp
