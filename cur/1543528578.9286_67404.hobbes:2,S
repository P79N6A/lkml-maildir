You can add the fields back but the wanpipe drivers are right now such a 
mess in 2.3.x (and ugly as hell in 2.2.x) that Im beginning to feel we should
throw them out of the 2.4.x kernel.
I looked at making them work. They make assumptions that arent valid in 2.2
and are totally invalid in 2.3.x. The softnetting of them is blind and I
believe untested (certainly if it worked Im amazed)
