Hi,
your suggestion to use it with the Mickeysoft Intellimouse driver does not
help.
- Everything except the wheel works fine with the normal ps2.
- The pointer just jumps around when I try imps2
- There is still no output on /dev/psaux when I tried imps2 and turn the
  wheel
There are different models of this logitech mouse.
http://www.inria.fr/koala/colas/mouse-wheel-scroll/
states that my mouse's wheel won't work with imwheel/gpm.
But if you say that this is just a gpm issue, well... you are
the expert :-)
Bye, Patrick
