I know nothing about the former site, so can't comment thereon.

I'll do what I can.

Following moving the boot code there, the next step is to load the
kernel image, either from 0x10000 (64k) or from 1M upwards, this
being dependent on various factors. However, the boot sector holds
several flags whose values are important AFTER the kernel image has
been loaded, so is moved out the way first.

That area of memory contains parameters configured by the BIOS of
the machine in question. I would suspect it's the parameters for
the floppy drives, and the code that follows is presumably that
used to determine how many sectors per track the floppy in /dev/fd0
actually has.

No problem.
Best wishes from Riley.
