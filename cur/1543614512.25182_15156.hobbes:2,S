If Midnight Commander does similar to the above it's pretty silly...
In Perl I normally do something like this in a loop (with a max-loops
limiter):
	opendir
	@dirs = readdir(FOO);
	closedir
	last unless @dirs;
	&remove_the_dirs(@dirs);
Clearly that's slack since you could have a million files in a
directory, but you see the point.  readdir(2) and getdents(2)
are inherently racy.  If your code does not assume such and take
appropriate action, it's broken.
