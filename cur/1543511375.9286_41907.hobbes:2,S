This is a heartfelt thank you to all of those involved in developing the
Linux kernel, it is a fantastic achievement.   
Personally I run linux (2.2.12) on a dual processor Pentium 90 (over
clocked to 100) and am very pleased.  (Originally based on Linux
Mandrake)
My linux server does a very nice job of serving the internet connection
for my house, as well as files via Samba, amongst other things.
BTW Linux with SMP and a S3 Trio64 (2MB) - using X (3.3.3.1) and fb
console - crashes (hangs, with screen half redrawn on a virtual console)
soon after boot, so I swapped to a S3 Virge and have not looked back.
