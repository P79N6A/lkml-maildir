Hmm. Actually the patch *does* use pci_bus. What got me confused is
definition in include/linux/pci.h:
+#ifndef CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS
+#define pci_domain_nr(pdev)    0
		       ~~~~
+#endif
I think it should be changed to 'pbus' to avoid confusion.

Root buses often do not have the self device, e.g. on alpha.
