Only question I have is how you make an efficient scheme for finding the block
number for an offset several gigabytes into the file.  You either get to run
through the list linearly (gaak) or you need to stick a tree or hash on the
front to allow semi-random access to a starting point to scan linearly from, at
which point you've probably blown any space savings unless you have a VERY low
fragmentation rate...
On the other hand, dynamic allocation of inodes is interesting, as it means
you're not screwed if over time, the NBPI value for the filesystem changes (or
if you simply guessed wrong at mkfs time) and you run out of inodes when you
still have space free.  Reiserfs V3 already does this, in fact...
