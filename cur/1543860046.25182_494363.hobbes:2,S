Right, this is obviously true in general. I don't understand enough
about selinux (who does?) to be sure what went wrong there on top
of this, but my impression was that I could have solved the problem
if I had been able to remount the root partition, or mount the selinux
file system, which was made impossible by the fact that I had no
permission to access one of the libraries for the mount binary.
The location of the library file was not the problem I had, as that
system doesn't have a separate /usr partition.
