Just too lazy to turn it off for 'that one' mail to a public place.
The following note spans every "welcome" mail for some lists I run...
"Please make sure, should you be away, that *NO* auto-response messages
(like "I'm out of office until ...") appear on the list. Failure to do
so will get you removed from the mailing list."
Either nobody's gone on vacation anymore or they stick to it. :)
