I think we got crisscrossed.
The original idea but using your helper suggestion would have been this:
dm->make_request_fn(bio)
{
	rq = __make_request(bio)
	if (this is a new request) {
		allocate clone from either a real device/path specific mempool() or a
dm q mempool
}
dm->prep_fn(rq)
{
	setup clone rq fields based on orig request fields.
}
dm->request_fn(rq)
{
	figure out which path to use;
	set rq->q;
	send cloned rq to real device;
}
The second idea based on Joe and Alasdair to break up make_request would
just have been a more formal break up of the dm->make_request_fn above,
because I thought your comment about not knowing how to allocate the
clone request meant that we did not know which q's mempool to take the
request from if we were going to take the cloned request from the real
device/path's mempool. I guess this does not really matter since we can
have just a dm q mempool of requests to use for cloned requests.
