That's the worst thing you could do for those of us maintaining
2.4/2.5 compatibility in drivers etc.
Having to check "oh I'm in 2.4, let's see if I'm in 2.4.23 or
$VENDOR 2.4.blah because then these random 2.5-like changes occurred"
sucks like h*ll.
It's much better to have 2.4.$x be like 2.4.$y than 2.5.$z.
