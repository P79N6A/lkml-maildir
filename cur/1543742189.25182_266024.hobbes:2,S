yes and no. its troubling that we're using an extra 100usecs of time
for the max process cycle, if the statistics make that number
meaningful. and why a 30% increase in the context switch rate? is that
an artifact or a real behavioural change? the xrun rate is not bad,
although i'd need to know the period size. 4 clicks per hour would
actually be unacceptable to most professionals, but this may have been
with significant loading outside of JACK - i don't know.

"maximum delay" is computed like this:
	 a) we know that jackd should be woken at regular, known
	    intervals based on the interrupt of the audio interface.
	 b) jackd is (often) blocked in poll(2), waiting for the
	    audio interface to become readable+writable.
	 c) on return from poll, we check the time we are returning
	    and compare it to the last wakeup. the difference should
	    be almost exactly the interrupt interval. 
	 d) any amount larger than this is a delay caused by
	    kernel scheduling. we track the largest such delay.

yeah, some ALSA drivers have broken stuff like this in them. its a
definite problem. this is why we know that some audio interfaces are
not able to provide acceptable performance for JACK - that is OK, the
same is true under Win/Mac where some h/w just can't be used for low
latency work.

we absolutely do not use SIGIO - i am one of the most vocal critics of
this interface even be present. POSIX says that signal handling
context is essentially crippled, so there is very little you can do
from there. in addition, measurements of signal delivery time on Linux
suggest that it is really quite slow. i considered using signals to
wake jack clients, but it was dramatically slower than using a FIFO
plus poll(2).
we block in poll(2), waiting for the interrupt from the audio
interface to mark the relevant jackd thread as runnable.
i don't know what you mean by "channel" information in this context.
