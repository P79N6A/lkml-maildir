I don't give two shits about S508.  For one thing that is a
U.S. statute.  It has no relevance here.

Even though, pci gets initialized pretty early in the boot sequence
doesn't it?  Considerably before init?

I don't really know.  I haven't had time to really get into the BIOS
accessibility yet.  I know for serial synths we can turn serial on in
lilo and at least hear what is going on.  Without modifying lilo for
each synth other than serial we have no way of knowing whether we have
the full lilo prompt or what.
If we could modify a linux BIOS and then flash it onto any flashable
BIOS that would be really useful.
