Right, spurious interrupts aren't a big deal on i386. They happen now 
and then with some devices because some hardware timing tolerances are a 
little too tight. See for example sections 5.7.1.3/5.7.4 of the intel 
850 chipset databook 
(
http://developer.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/29068702.pdf
) :
"6. Upon receiving the second internally generated INTA# pulse, the PIC 
returns the interrupt vector. If no interrupt request is present because 
the request was too short in duration, the PIC will return vector 7 from 
the master controller."
"In both the edge-triggered and level-triggered modes, the IRQ inputs 
must remain active until after the falling edge of the first internal 
INTA#. If the IRQ input goes inactive before this time, a default IRQ7 
vector will be returned."
