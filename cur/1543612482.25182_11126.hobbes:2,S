If you can afford rewriting/rearchitecting your application it's pretty
clear that the share-nothing model is the winner one.
But if you can rewrite your application using a share-nothing model you
don't need any fancy clustering architectures since beowulf like cluster
would work for you and they'll give you a great scalability over the
number of nodes.
The problem arises when you've to choose between a new architecture
( share nothing ) using conventional clusters and a
share-all/keep-all-your-application-as-is one.
The share nothing is cheap and gives you a very nice scalability, these
are the two mayor pros for this solution.
On the other side you've a vary bad scalability and a very expensive
solution.
But you've to consider :
1) rewriting is risky
2) good developers to rewrite your stuff are expensive ( $100K up to $150K
	in my area )
These are the reason that let me think that conventional SMP machines will
have a future in addition to my believing that technology will help a lot
to improve scalability.
