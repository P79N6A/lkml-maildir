Well, I initially come here from DOS/Win world and in fact actually used 
umsdos for some time (heck, it's still installed on one abandoned box).
But I presume there are other worlds (maybe Mac?) with filesystems unsuited 
for Linux root fs (like fat), why invent u[fs] for them too?
OTOH it means extra effort in umsdos rewrite, and since I don't do that 
effort, I'd better shut up now.
