Subject: [PATCH] sleep: Fix oops in enter_state
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

If ACPI sleep is not configured, but someone still wants to run
swsusp, he'd get oops in enter_state. This is regression since 2.6.14
and this fixes it.
