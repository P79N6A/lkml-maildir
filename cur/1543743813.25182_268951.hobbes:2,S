Ahh.. Interesting. One improvement might be to make sure that this driver 
links in very late in the game, so that if any other drivers have 
allocated the IO, at least it won't override that. Also, it might make 
sense to say that the dang thing can share interrupts.
But yes, we should probably make sure to make it harder to enable the
driver by mistake, and try to do minimal probing of it. I have no idea how
to probe for the thing, though.
Alan, Vojtech, do you have any register information on this thing? Some 
docs to try to realize when it's not there? Or some other way to detect 
the IBM PC110 hardware (BIOS strings, something?)
