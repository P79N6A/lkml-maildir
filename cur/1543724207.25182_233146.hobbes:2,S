i`ve done some of my favorite under-bridge-crafted tests, so to speak.
the test looked like this:
time find / -xdev | \
bzcat --compress | bzcat --decompress | \
bzcat --compress | bzcat --decompress | \
bzcat --compress | bzcat --decompress | \
cat > /dev/null
The patches applied were Con`s autoswap + autoregulate
it was performed on a p3-600, 10krpm scsi in two following scenarios:
1. mem=48M, swap=off
2.4.20-pre9:		3m20
2.6.7-con:		4m09
2.6.7-vanilla:		4m09
2. mem=32M, swap=on
2.4.20-pre9:		5m37
2.6.7-con:		6m37
2.6.7-vanilla:		7m31
which still leaves 2.4 the leader.
