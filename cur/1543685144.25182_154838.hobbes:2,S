Subject: [patch] [Kconfig] disable CONFIG_FD on ia64, which has no floppy drive

As of linux-2.6.0-test2-ia64-030729, there is no asm-ia64/floppy.h,
and so the fd driver won't work.  Other architectures have various
legacy floppy controllers, but ia64 does not have one and is never
likely to.
David Mosberger says:

There is no reason to ever have CONFIG_FD on ia64, but if it does get
turned on then the build will fail.  Therefore, I suggest this patch
to keep it off:
