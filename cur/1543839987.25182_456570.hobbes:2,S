Evgeniy already enumerated this, both on his web site and in the
current thread.
Unlike some people seem to imply, Evgeniy did research all the other
implementations of event queueing out there, including kqueue.
He took the best of that survey, adding some of his own ideas,
and that's what kevent is.  It's not like he's some kind of
charlatan and made arbitrary decisions in his design without any
regard for what's out there already.
Again, the proof is in the pudding, he wrote applications against his
interfaces and tested them.  That's what people need to really do if
they want to judge his interface, try to write programs against it and
report back any problems they run into.
