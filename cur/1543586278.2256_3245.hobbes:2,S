You can get patches for 2.4.1 which work fine in 2.4.2 (at least on my 2400)
at:
http://domsch.com/linux/
Along with a decent collection of information about dell poweredge systems
and linux in general.
I recommend 2.4.2, as far as I've seen it run, it seems to fix various
problems I had with the eepro driver in SMP as well.
