I started to get these messages while formatting floppies on a 2.2.5-ac6
SMP machine:
 Verifying cylinder  0, head 0 floppy0: unexpected interrupt
floppy0: sensei repl[0]=80
 Verifying cylinder  7, head 0 floppy0: unexpected interrupt

and so on...
Not to mention some lost interrupts on an IDE disk, causing most of the
processes being caught in an uninterruptible wait for that disk (it was
with 2.2.2-ac7 SMP on the same machine)
now should these be considered as kernel or controller failures?
Thanks,
Andras
