no really :-)
I don't wanna start here another-*nix-vs-nt-religious-war just telling of
my eperience.
I use NT since 3.1 Advanced Server (which was installed from diskettes
:o|) and I can tell that M$ is doin' anything to make their monolithic
kernel reliable (or MORE reliable).
We're running mission critical ERP applications on NT and our productive
machine was last rebooted in February, so because there's no 'uptime'
utility, I don't know the exact dates. Our logbook shows last reboot entry
in Feb. From the WORKSTATION point of view I should tell that NT is
bloatware for most our users. They don't need all these colourized icons
flying arround to do their work, they're only doin' some letters in Word
and some Excel sheets, and a gui for the ERP app, not more. So everything
beyond is unnecessary.

I agree.

...because without at least ONE M$ station in your company you will not be
able to read all these little word documents, that come through your
e-mail, these excel sheets, that're exchanged. M$ is the quasi standard,
although it's as proprietary as it can be. (although there is very good
work from stardivision p. ex., the import filters are excellent)

M$ is not able to handle their own products, because they simply cannot
handle all the dependencies because of the monolithic style of the kernel
and the gui integrated.

I guess so too... :-)
We're goin' into pilot in January 2000 to switch our ERP to Linux, let's
see if it can handle such loads :-)
