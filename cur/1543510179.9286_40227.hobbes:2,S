   The common interface wouldn't have to try to use every feature of the
   ACLs in the underlying filesystem.  Even a least-common-demoninator
   interface would be much better than nothing.  Maybe restrict to
   directory ACLs only, etc.
The problem is that systems that use per-file ACL's are very different
from systems that use directory ACL's --- apples and oranges.  You can't
map one to the other; there is no least common denominator.
