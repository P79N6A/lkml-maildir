I'm sorry, I don't know, I have no time to test these drivers now and 
I have received no help from you regarding test methodology so far, 
so I have even no idea how to test these drivers.
Everything what I know about IDE VLB chips is at 
http://www.ryston.cz/petr/vlb/
and there is also a list of VLB IDE controllers I own. I also own 
several ide drives - old Alps DR-312C, ST3120A, WDC: AC340, AC22100, 
AC33100, AC24300 and other and some ATAPI CD-ROMS. As a test box I 
can use OPTi895 motherboard with 32 MB RAM and AM486DX5-133 
processor, I have also A80486DX-50 processor for testing 50 MHz VLB 
bus.
So if anybody give me exact test directions, I'm able to do these 
tests if they will be not too much time consuming. But please no 
"compile the kernel" or "make some copy" advices.
In fact, I think at first shall be all IDE/ATA/ATAPI drivers tested 
whether they give correct timing on IDE bus according ATA/ATAPI 
specifications and with various load. Then problem drives can be 
tested. But it needs good laboratory equipment.
Back to a.m. drivers. What about the problem with region stuff? Was 
it rectified already?
