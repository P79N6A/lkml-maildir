I was assuming that the code really does something like:
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_MC
		some_global_thing = <expr>
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
		some_global_thing = <expr>
#endif
	}
	...
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
	some_other_global_thing = <expr>
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_MC
	some_other_global_thing = <expr>
#endif
Which, looking a bit closer, was wrong (yes?)
It is a bit irregular that in one place we do the SMT processing first and
in another we do the MC processing first, but I guess it'll work OK.
We do need to be super-careful in the reviewing and testing here.  If we
slip up we won't have a nice crash to tell us.  Instead we'll find that
some machines with some configs will, under some workloads, take a few
percent longer than they should.  We could waste people's time for years
until some developer stumbles across something.
