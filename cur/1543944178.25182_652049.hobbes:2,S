I am not aware of any.
The hardware related parts of the 1394a PHY layer spec have AFAIR
enhancements over 1394-1995 to avoid bursts of bus reset events when
connectors scrape into or out of the ports.  But what I saw on a few
occasions now were proper self ID complete events, not merely bus reset
events.  (The firewire stack only cares for self ID complete, therefore
multiple bus reset events before one self ID complete event aren't a
problem in the first place.  I don't know though whether these bursts of
bus resets which 1394a addressed had self ID complete events in them or
not.)
