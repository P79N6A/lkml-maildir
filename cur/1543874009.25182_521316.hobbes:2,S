Subject: ACPI initialization failure with v2.6.21-rc4

Hi,
The kernel version mentioned in the subject won't boot because the ACPI
system does not get initialized; the system freezes on an outb() in
acpi_os_write_port() i.e. it does not do anything anymore and just hangs.
Here is the `stack trace' I managed to extract via debugging output:
	-- acpi_os_write_port(0xb2, 240, 8)
	-- acpi_hw_set_mode(ACPI_SYS_MODE_ACPI)
	-- acpi_enable()
	-- acpi_enable_subsystem(~ACPI_NO_ACPI_ENABLE)
	-- acpi_early_init()
	...
Notes:
	* acpi_os_write_port(): I printk'd the arguments; the port
	  formatted with %#x and the value with %u.
	* acpi_enable_subsystem(): I removed ACPI_NO_HARDWARE_INIT
	  from the arguments because it is not used anymore.
	  In this context I want to mention that it probably can be
	  removed from include/acpi/actypes.h generally.
Random question:
	I noticed that acpi_gbl_FADT is declared in
	include/acpi/acglobal.h but where is it actually defined and
	initialized?
HTH,
Hannes
