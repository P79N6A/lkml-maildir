Let's put it in another way:
I'd go with Linus suggestion, as it is not icky (although it is a lot more
limited in scope than adding a flag to EV_* that could be use for any event,
etc).
I am not going with the current icky hackery that makes every consumer of
EV_* need to know when they are real events, or "notification" events using
outside information.  It is not "userspace already handles it", even.  it is
"HAL already handles it", BTW.
And unless Dmitry agrees with Linus' suggestion (maybe as a temporary
stopgap while something better gets written?), we are not going anywhere,
anyway.
