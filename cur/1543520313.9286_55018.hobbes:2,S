Of course no, but there are some things that benefit from being put in the
kernel - especially daemons serving huge files - nfsd and httpd for example.
Also, don't forget that sooner or later linux will be used in embedded
systems, very often with limited space for user-space stuff and also
requiring speed and reliability (think of web-manageable switches, hubs,
routers, RAS servers, gasoline distributors etc.) - and most certainly
daemon implemented in the kernel will most certainly be faster and more
reliable than the user-space one (and certainly much smaller). Also, that
one thing or another is in the SOURCES doesn't mean you have to use it. I
won't use khttpd most probably, but I don't mind it being in the sources -
if it's good for some people, it's good for me as well. The key to success
is a CHOICE and FLEXIBILITY, IMHO.
