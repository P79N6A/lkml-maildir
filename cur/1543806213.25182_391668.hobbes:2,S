Whoops.  Let's try that again:
Pristine (with build_sched_domains measurement):
[    9.942253] Brought up 64 CPUs
[    9.942904] Total of 64 processors activated (143654.91 BogoMIPS).
[    9.943995] build_sched_domains: start
[   32.108439] migration_cost=0,32232,39021
[   37.894391] build_sched_domains: end
Patched (with build_sched_domains measurement):
[    9.942267] Brought up 64 CPUs
[    9.942930] Total of 64 processors activated (143654.91 BogoMIPS).
[    9.944032] build_sched_domains: beginmigration_cost=0,31854,38739
[   23.868304] build_sched_domains: end
