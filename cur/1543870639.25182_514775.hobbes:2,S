Oops, I guess so.  I've been doing a lot more Xen pagetable work for the
last couple of weeks, so it caught my eye this time.

Those are bugs that can occur, but they don't apply in this case.  The
vmi implementation of kmap_atomic_pte() would be:
static void *vmi_kmap_atomic_pte(struct page *page, enum km_type type)
{
	void *ptep = kmap_atomic(page, type);
	vmi_map_pt_hook(type, ptep, page_to_pfn(page));
	return ptep;
}
Right?  Which is functionally identical to the code in your patch,
except wrapped up in a new function.
