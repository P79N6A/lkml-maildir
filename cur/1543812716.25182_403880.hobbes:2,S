Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/6] support separate namespaces for sysv
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is more followup on this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114108773827517&w=2
The following series makes it possible to isolate different
sets of sysv structures (msg, sem, and shm) on one kernel.
The initial patch makes it much more feasible to access these
disparite sets from the traditional sysctl interfaces.
