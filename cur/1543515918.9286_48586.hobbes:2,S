I agree that the current code is a total mess (I have converted it to
the ipc/util.h helper functions, and I found further SMP and UP races)
_if_ I find a simple serialization, then I'll kill the semaphore.

What about a 100-gigabyte shm segment (on a 64-bit platform) with a fast
scsi disk system? The semaphore will prevent any tagged commands, and it
will downgrade (performance wise) the scsi system to a slow ide disk.
Btw, I'm sure that for multi-threaded applications, the mmap performance
of Linux will be poor because everything is single-threaded. I'll
write a benchmark and compare it with WinNT/Win95.

shm_swap() must not acquire a semaphore, or we could lock-up during
low-memory.
