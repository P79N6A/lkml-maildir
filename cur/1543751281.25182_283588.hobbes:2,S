You got to be kidding now?
99% of the features distributions have applied to their 2.4 based kernels 
are "enterprise" features such as direct IO, AIO, etc.
Really I can't recall any "attempt to make 2.4 stable" from the distros,
its mostly "attempt to backport nice v2.6 feature".
Do you have any example?

It took sometime to happen, but instability related to "high memory pressure" 
has been fixed in almost all cases long ago (the only remaining issue to
my knowledged is loopback device with highmemory).
I hardly see complaints of "crashes under load" problems since v2.4.19/20 
or so.
