As far as I know, volatile requires that the compiler actually perform
all reads and writes implied by the program, in whatever order is
implied by the program.
In the case of GCC's extended asm, that means it is ok to read a
volatile, pass the effective address of the /copy/ as the asm operand,
then write the modified copy back to the volatile.
