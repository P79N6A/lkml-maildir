I'm on the "Linux Support Givaway" list, and have been contacted with
a rather bizarre problem.  
She was trying to install RedHat 6 (with kernel 2.2.6, I suppose) on
an Olivetti Pentium 120, and the Redhat boot disk wasn't working.
After fixing this problem, she discovered that her performance was
extremely poor (it took 20 minutes to change the wallpaper) .
The amount of RAM the kernel found was normal, the bogomips value at
boot was sane (56 or so), and it doesn't thrash, it just takes forever to
perform any disk activity ( the hdd light is on constantly but it
isn't constantly seeking).
I had her do hdparm -t , which gave a transfer rate of .38 Megs per
second.  Any ideas on what could cause this?  Unfortunately, I don't
have any information about the chipset and such, though I do have the
output of hdparm -i:
