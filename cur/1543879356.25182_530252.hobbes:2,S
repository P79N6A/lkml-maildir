But you can't mmap() a directory anyway so ... oh.  Interesting.
afs_file_readpage() does directories too.  The only thing I can think
of then is
struct address_space_operations afs_file_aops = {
        .readpage       = afs_file_readpage,
}
struct address_space_operations afs_dir_aops = {
        .readpage       = afs_key_readpage,
}
int afs_file_readpage(file, page){
    return afs_key_readpage(file->private, page)
}
but that's a lot of code to avoid a single stack allocation.  The
whole fake file pointer thing still strikes me as a little ugly, and
you're definitely not the first one who needed this sort of hackery.
ugh
