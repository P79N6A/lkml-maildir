The correctness of this particular change (IMO) is not predicated on the
later patches, otherwise I would have done just that.  It accomplishes
what I intended as is here in this patch.
Why do you think moving the logic to pick_next_highest is a better
design?  To be honest, I haven't really studied your new logic in
push_rt_tasks to understand why you might feel this way.  If you can
make the case that it is better in the other location then I agree with
you that we should move it there in this patch, and potentially adjust
it later.  Until then, I see no problem with it being here.

I think the only one real solid case of that is the removal of on_rq
from the double_lock conditions.  I agree with your point that it should
come later.  I'll put it back in and adjust it later.  I'll wait to hear
your argument on the pick_highest_task before moving the other one.

?
I generalized the core functionality so it worked as I believed it
should in the two places that I used it.  I don't follow your objection
here.  Did I break something (besides the on_rq thing?).  My feeling is
that both need the same locking semantics, but we don't need the check
for the priority shift in the optimized case as we do in the loop.  So
that is where I delineated the common code from the specialized.

If that's the case then you are already broken if we hit the wake_idle()
case, no?  We can drop the lock there too.
But I am not convinced it cannot be done in a race free way.  I can be
convinced otherwise.

Hmm...I'm not sure I follow.  Can you elaborate more?

Fair enough...I'll fix it.  But my point still stands that a decent
comment from you would have stopped my "cleverness" ;)

Sure we do! (unless I introduced a bug)
task->cpus_allowed and task->nr_cpus_allowed is updated for *all*
classes.  It is only acted upon to change the migration state if the
task is of an RT class.

No, other way around.  (de)queuing an RT task, or changing an RT tasks
mask will change the migration state.  So if you have a normal task, its
tracking its hamming-weight...and then you convert it to RT, it would
update migration state on the enqueue.
Likewise, if you alter the mask of an RT task, it would update the
migration state right away.  It never would flow the other way.
