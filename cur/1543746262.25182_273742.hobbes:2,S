I know from personal experience that it *does* break Acrobat Reader,
which, unfortunately, is binary-only and also a programm that I 
use quite often. For me this means I cannot use reiser4 (as root fs anyway)
without metas disabled.
How about making metas a mount option? Right now disabling metas 
requires patching the source.
