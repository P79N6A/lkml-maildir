And what it's changing ?

Yeah ? What's the difference: you should keep kludges spread around
kernel up to date, ifdef's or separate patch ? All choices requre more
or less the same amount of work for kernel developers (IMHO most simple 
one is first choice BTW).

No. It would be worse: if user downloaded patch and patch is rejected it's
NOT kernel maintainer headache but user's (or patch maintainer's :-)
headache. When you are using something distributed with kernel you EXPECT
it to apply cleanly unlike separate patch.

Yes and there exist ONLY ONE way to guaratee this: maintain patch just
like it was adopted and included in kernel. Where is the win ?

If it does not run then why patch is there in first place ? You can do it
yourself without problems. Just do 
-- cut --
patch <patch options here>
find -name '*.rej' -o -name '*.orig' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
-- cut --
But if you want manual change of patch so it'll reflect kernel changes
it's called maintainance and is MORE difficult for patch then for part of
kernel.

See above.
P.S. Have you EVER maintained non-trivial patch for any program ? I did.
