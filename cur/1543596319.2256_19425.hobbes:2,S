 I think that the message above  doesn't matter with your nescape crash,
 When linux kernel boot, it reserve all usable low memory,for example
       kernel:  BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
       kernel:  BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 then kernel call find_smp_config to get MP configuration table if your machine
 is SMP, and the function will reserve the MP-table at 0xfa000,0xfb000, 0xf4000,
 and because these regions were reserved by kernel, so kernel would
 print the message, so it doesn't cause any problem on your machine.
