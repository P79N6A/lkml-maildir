This is broken, do_ide_request() is already called with the request lock
held. tq_disk run -> generic_unplug_device (grab lock) ->
__generic_unplug_device -> do_ide_request(). You just introduced a
deadlock.
This code would have caused hangs or massive corruption immediately if
ide_lock wasn't ready held there. Not to mention instant spin_unlock
BUG() triggers in queue_command()
