I went back through and marked most of Jeff's "resolved" bugs as closed.  
The one I left as closed is number 85, concerning use of cli and friends 
in hamradio.  An inspection of the source in 2.5.62 shows they are still 
there.  If there was a patch to correct this, it apparently still hasn't 
been merged in latest bk.
