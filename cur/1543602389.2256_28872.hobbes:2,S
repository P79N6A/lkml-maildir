That's probably the default of most chipsets, but I wonder if you could
tell it to send the busted packets up the stack anyway.  Then, the driver
could make the decision in software whether or not to correct/foward, or
discard the packet...  I assume that in order to detect a CRC error,
the NIC already has the packet in it's buffers somewhere...
