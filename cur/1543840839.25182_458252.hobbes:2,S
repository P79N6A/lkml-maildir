If we revamp the entire kbuild infrastructure to allow building the
_whole_ kernel with --combine then I might be inclined to agree -- we
could do that instead of a CONFIG_COMBINED_COMPILE option.
But if, as I suggest, we're doing the simple option which combines only
the files which tend to get most benefit from it -- those which are in
the same directory -- then there's not a lot of point in the separate
target. It really doesn't take that much extra time.
