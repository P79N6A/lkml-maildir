That's pretty much what Linus suggested. He proposed having a new
syscall interface which was just calls into the magic page. All
syscalls would thus be available via the magic page. The kernel could
then selectively optimise individual syscalls (like gettimeofday(2))
or optimise the interface into kernel space, without libc ever having
to know about the details.
