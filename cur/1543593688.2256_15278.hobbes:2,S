 after following the several [very entertaining/enlightening] threads on
VM [mis]behaviour, I wanted to ask a similar question: are there any
counters/statistics about the various buffers/caches in the VMS system,
that are easily available to userland? I know other Unix OSSes, where
you can get a lot of information about the efficiency of the subsystem.
