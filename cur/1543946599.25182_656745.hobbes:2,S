Option 1 would be best, I think:
 1) Remove the #ifdef CONFIG_DMI around DMI fixup tables and callbacks
    definition, so that everything exists and gcc is happy. gcc is able
    to optimize out the DMI fixup table (it is not present in the binary
    when compiling with DMI=n), but gcc doesn't seem to be able to
    optimize out the DMI fixup callbacks (they are still present in the
    binary). So this would leave some unused code in the binary, which
    is not completely satisfying.
gcc _should_ be able to remove the callbacks as long as they are static and
have no references.  If even the latest gcc versions are still incluing the
unreferenced, static function in the final vmlinux then let's get gcc fixed?
