Subject: [PATCH] Define the shmem_inode_info flags directly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew: This is a pretty basic and obvious cleanup IMO.  How about a ride in
-mm?
Defining flags in terms of other flags is always confusing.  Give them literal
values instead of defining them in terms of VM_flags.  While we're at it, move
them to a header file in preparation for the introduction of a
SHMEM_HUGETLB flag.
