Its in the high mem handling routines. It means the machine stalled for
a moment doing I/O because it had no memory below 1Gb to use.

The answer is yes. You can actually build yourself a custom none bounce
buffer 1.8GB kernel with about 2Gb of user virtual space per app. For some
applications it will perform better.
