most (if not all) modern BIOS's have an "Init {AGP/PCI} display first"
option. You may need to fiddle with that.

Extremely unlikely. WRT agpgart, it pokes chipset registers, not
graphic card registers.
It may even be that the two cards you have won't play together.
Try them both _independantly_ before jumping to conclusions about
