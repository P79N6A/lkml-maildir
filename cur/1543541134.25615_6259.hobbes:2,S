Hmm, is it still broken?  I'm using xterm from X 4.0.1a in 2.4.0-test6-pre2
and it seems to function fine.

This is pmcia related and is still broken on my hardware using in-core
pcmcia.

Haven't seen this happen in a long time and I use shm a lot.

bzzt.  ppp and irda.  clashes.

yep, fixed.

hmmm.  not fixed imo.  my laptop w/ dhinds pkg works fine, slot 0 is the
bottom, 1 top.  w/ in-core, the bottom shows up as 1, and the top is
unusable.  it hangs or crashes when a card is inserted.  sometimes i can
un-hang it by removing all cards and inserting a tulip card in the bottom
slot.  last tried several kernels ago so ymmv.
