They've got some newer stuff.  The best way to get the latest numbers
would be to call Craig Miller 801-861-7000 (cmiller@novell.com), Dana
Henriksen (dhenriks@novell.com), same # or Drew Major, Darren's brother,
same # (rdmajor@novell.com).  Drew will have the latest numbers for
certain since he wrote the Web Server on NetWare, but both Craig and
Dana are the guys to talk to about NetWare and could get them.  Dana is
the maintainer and principal architect of NetWare and knows more about
it than anyone except Drew and Darren.
