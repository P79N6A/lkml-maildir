A better way to phrase that is to say the don't fit into the unix
culture well.

Yes. :)

Roughly the set can be found with:
find /proc/ -type f -uid 0 -perm -0200 ! '(' -path '/proc/[0-9]*' ')' ! '(' -perm 0022 ')'
find /sys/ -type f -uid 0 -perm -0200 !  ! '(' -perm 0022 ')'
Very few writable files in /proc or sysfs do any sort of capability checking.
In essence every little file by every little driver out there has
this problem.  
The unix permission way to handle this would be to chown these files
after bootup to the appropriate users (because the permissions cannot
be stored in the filesystem).
I have a hard time believing that chasing ever little driver is going to 
be a tractable solution to this problem.

Sorry. Too many email messages that just seemed to miss the point,
when we had that miscommunication...

Cool.
