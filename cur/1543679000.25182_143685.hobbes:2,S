(simple?  decode stack, find out where he was sleeping, and then have to 
decide what to do based upon that after _every sleep_?  sprinkle scheduling 
decisions around every place that does wakeups?... i can just imagine Al's 
reaction to someone suggesting that for the VFS... someone better run fast 
and hide well:)

What I think kills the priority redistribution idea is _massive_ 
complexity.  I don't see anything simple.  You would have to build the 
logical connections between tasks, which currently doesn't exist.  Wakeups 
and task switches are extremely light weight operations, and no decision 
you make at wakeup time has a ghost of a chance of not hurting like 
hell.  Just using the monotonic_clock() in the wakeup/schedule paths is 
fairly painful.  There is just no way you can run around looking for and 
processing "who shot JR" information in those paths (no way _I_ can imagine 
anyway) without absolutely destroying performance.
