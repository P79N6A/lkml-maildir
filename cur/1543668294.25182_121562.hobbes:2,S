   This is basically a patch from Randolph Chung who tells me that when
   a syscall is done from the kernel, you cannot pass user mode pointers
   to it on some architectures.  So we need to copy the sock_filter
   array into kernel space before we pass it to the real system call.

   Please apply.
Applied, thanks.
