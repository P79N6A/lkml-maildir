Whoa, calm down. 
The patch was meant essentially for Dominik only, so he could verify that
it worked with his new PCMCIA code. The only reason the patch is untested
is because I don't have the hardware in question.
The reason the patch was unwritten in the first place is because, as I
mentioned in the previous email, no one has used this feature. Dominik
followed the usage model exactly, and the feature was simple, and
predefined. That's the only reason it was obvious, and sent in the first
place.
Surely you're sore that your code has required some modifications since
Dominik has started working on PCMCIA, and I'm sure that no harm was
intended. It's had some bumps, but IMO, he's done a great job, and the 
result is a vast improvement. The least you could is give the guy some 
slack, instead of whining about your own inconveniences. 
Thanks,
