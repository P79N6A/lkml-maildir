  I seem to have been wrong about the kernel update fixing my mtu issue. 
I am not 100% sure, but I think 7200 works if the forcedeth system is 
sending, but not if the r8169 system is sending.
  I tried a mtu of 3000, and basically the same errors, but I did 
noticed something interesting. Note the three different byte sizes.
DMA: Out of SW-IOMMU space for 2410 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0
DMA: Out of SW-IOMMU space for 3014 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0
DMA: Out of SW-IOMMU space for 3014 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0
DMA: Out of SW-IOMMU space for 3022 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0
  On a side note, leaving the mtu at 1500 seems to work without error, 
and I get about the same performance.
