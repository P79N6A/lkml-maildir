This is a serious bug in misrouted_irq().  disable_irq() is a software
state and must be repsected.
[IRQ]: Check IRQ_DISABLED in misrouted_irq
The misrouted interrupt function didn't check the IRQ_DISABLED flag
before calling the handlers.  This is highly undesirable as handlers
are usually disabled for a good reason.
