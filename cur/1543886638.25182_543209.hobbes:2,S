Subject: [RFC] - LXR on kernel.org ? was: Re: What tools to use?

Hi !
I like lxr pretty much.
i`m not a programmer, but i often need some information on "what`s the driver version of xyz in latest kernel" or "was this or that feature/patch already being merged" or "i have this line of code in kernel - how does it look in recent kernel , did it change " ?
over the years, i have downloaded tons of kernels for this, very much waste of bandwidth and time - because whenever i need to take a look, i have no recent kernel source around - so i need to download that big thing and go trough that untar orgy. having recent browsable/searchable and easy to find lxr`ed kernel-source online would be really great
i seldom find lxr for current kernels on the net, so i just wonder: 
why not adding a link to every kernel an kernel.org kernel, pointing to recent lxr`ed kernel source - or - even better - make lxr`ed kernel source part of kernel.org (so we have "B V VI 	C Changelog LXR" ) ? 
sure, i know kernel.org itself is very busy, but maybe this can be done via dedicated lxr machine/webserver someone is willing to donate !?
for myself, i would happily donate some bucks for this.

lxr is pretty good (glimpse on its own as well can be useful). If you
don't want to set it up yourself, then you could consider to use the
online version at 
http://lxr.linux.no/
Another good thing is "make ctags" in the kernel source dir - this
will  let you quickly jump to declarations etc and back with a few
simple keystrokes in editors like vim.

"make cscope" is another good option. It'll generate an index usable
by the cscope tool (

).
