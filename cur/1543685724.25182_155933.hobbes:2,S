I have a pc with a VIA MVP3, that I use as an x-terminal.
Using dma is not an option, I got the impression that ide
developers consider the chip so broken they don't want to
try make that work. That is ok with me, I wouldn't consider
running anything needing good io performance on that old thing.
What is worse is that 2.6 ide don't work with it at all.
Booting attempts die early of io errors, sometimes it don't
even find the root fs superblock, other times dies a little later.
So it is sort of left behind, running 2.5.69-mm3 which at least works
in pio mode. The harddisk is a old 240MB thing with debian
shoehorned onto it.
There is no AGP card in the machine, so AGP is clearly not necessary
to get io trouble.
