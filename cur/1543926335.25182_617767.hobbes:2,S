I dont know, (what a strange idea is it anyway ?) but reading two Solaris 
functions just gave me the example of non true software perfection.

I would say this code was OK 10 years ago.
Now that a processor (say an Opteron in 64 bits mode, used on SUN hardware), 
can perform a multiply in few cycles, ts2hrt() could use a normal multiply and 
an addition.
Processors are improving, compilers are improving, memory sizes are 
increasing, source code (and algorithms) should be changed accordingly.
(gcc for example already knows the reciprocal division trick and so can 
compile this :
hrt2ts_div(hrtime_t hrt, timestruc_t *tsp)
{
     tsp->tv_nsec = do_div(hrt, NANOSEC);
     tsp->tv_sec = hrt;
}
to :
         movq    %rdi, %rdx
         movabsq $19342813113834067, %rax
         shrq    $9, %rdx
         mulq    %rdx
         shrq    $11, %rdx
         imulq   $1000000000, %rdx, %rax
         movq    %rdx, (%rsi)
         subq    %rax, %rdi
         movl    %edi, 8(%rsi)
while
hrtime_t
ts2hrt(const timestruc_t *tsp)
{
return tsp->tv_sec * NANOSEC + tsp->tv_nsec;
}
can be inlined as it is trivial (and much faster than Solaris version)
         movq    (%rdi), %rdx
         mov     8(%rdi), %eax
         imulq   $1000000000, %rdx, %rdx
         addq    %rdx, %rax
