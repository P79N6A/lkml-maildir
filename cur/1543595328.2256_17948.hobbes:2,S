Yes, I did.  It's even faster than xfce but there's one problem: it just 
isn't very much like a modern desktop.  xfce is, to a surprising degree, like 
a modern desktop.  It's roughly equivalent to W95 I'd say - more 
sophisticated in some areas, less in others.  Oh, did I mention I haven't run 
into a bug yet?  It's true.
