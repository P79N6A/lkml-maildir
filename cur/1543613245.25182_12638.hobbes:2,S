   If more of the internet fit in to the 'A' catagory than the 'B'
   catagory, I'd be very tempted to enable ECN and crusade against the
   remaining deviants, but right now it seems like merely an annoyance
   with no real gains.
Amusingly the only web site I regularly visit for which I have to
explicitly turn ECN off is www.sun.com :-)
