I've had similar problems as you describe on completely different machines
due to a RAM compatibility problem. It was OK for memtest86, but burnBX
(from cpuburn) could detect the problem within 8 seconds. It seems to me
that this RAM had problems with its I/O in general, possibly with back-to-back
timings, etc... memtest86 is very good at detecting defective memory cells,
but not as good at detecting I/O problems it seems.
Cheers,
Willy
