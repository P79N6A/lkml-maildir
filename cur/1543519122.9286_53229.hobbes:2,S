Ok, will do.
I should mention that I am running a couple of other minimal patches
(small ptrace things).  They've been working well for over 9 months and
I'd be completely astounded if they were at all related.  But I can back
them out if you really feel it's important.

Hmm.  For me, `mount /doshd; ls /doshd; umount /doshd' reproduces it
quite reliably.  The filesystem is in /etc/fstab as follows:
/dev/hda1       /doshd   vfat        gid=102,rw,noexec,umask=007   0   0
It's a 4 gig partition.  Oh, and it's FAT32.
