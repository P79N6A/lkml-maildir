Sure! You can check OpenVZ project (
http://openvz.org
) for example of 
required resource management. BTW, I must agree with other people here 
who noticed that per-process resource management is really useless and 
hard to use :(
Briefly about required resource management:
1) CPU:
- fairness (i.e. prioritization of containers). For this we use SFQ like 
fair cpu scheduler with virtual cpus (runqueues). Linux-vserver uses 
tocken bucket algorithm. I can provide more details on this if you are 
interested.
- cpu limits (soft, hard). OpenVZ provides only hard cpu limits. For 
this we account the time in cycles. And after some credit is used do 
delay of container execution. We use cycles as our experiments show that 
statistical algorithms work poorly on some patterns :(
- cpu guarantees. I'm not sure any of solutions provide this yet.
2) disk:
- overall disk quota for container
- per-user/group quotas inside container
in OpenVZ we wrote a 2level disk quota which works on disk subtrees. 
vserver imho uses 1 partition per container approach.
- disk I/O bandwidth:
we started to use CFQv2, but it is quite poor in this regard. First, it 
doesn't prioritizes writes and async disk operations :( And even for 
sync reads we found some problems we work on now...
3) memory and other resources.
- memory
- files
- signals and so on and so on.
For example, in OpenVZ we have user resource beancounters (original 
author is Alan Cox), which account the following set of parameters:
kernel memory (vmas, page tables, different structures etc.), dcache 
pinned size, different user pages (locked, physical, private, shared), 
number of files, sockets, ptys, signals, network buffers, netfilter 
rules etc.
4. network bandwidth
traffic shaping is already ok here.

this is the price to pay. but it happens quite rarelly as was noticed 
already...
