In that case, I'm missing 0.02, 0.03 and 0.13 out of that set...
 >> 	0.95b
 >> 	0.95c
 >> 	0.96d
 >> 	0.97.1 through 0.97.5
 >> 	0.97.7 through 0.97.? (one or more versions)

Good. Now I've found the 0.99.14a-z and 0.99.15a-j tarballs and added
them, I'm solid from 0.99.14 to date...
Best wishes from Riley.
