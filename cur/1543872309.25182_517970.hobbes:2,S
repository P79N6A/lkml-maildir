It worked ok on thinkpad x32. BIOS did the setup in resume case (with
acpi_sleep=..., anyway), and radeonfb could pick the card up from there.

suspend.sf.net, s2ram there has a long list of tricks. If you invent

...or you can try vbetool; it is similar hack to acpi_sleep=... , but
it works for more people.
