Age of the disk doesn't matter, they'll die at any age.  They seem to die
most frequently either within one year, or after 3 years.
Turning off UDMA probably won't help, it looks like it's time to restore
from backups.  If you try to recover data from the disk, make sure you mount
it in read-only mode if you can get the drive that far up if you reboot.
