OK. I'm not sure what gave you the impression I thought they were.

	All of these places are highly likely to also be in the context of the
task that has the lock in it's task->delays struct. This could be a
strongly recommended practice for taking the lock -- we can add a
comment next to the lock suggesting as much.

	It could be good for establishing a lower bound on contention resulting
from locking implementations of task_notify. I think in that respect
it's comparing two species of apples.
	We need to clarify what locking we're talking about -- locking in
task_notify to protect the notification list vs. locking in delayacct to
protect the accounting data consistency. I think that a simple lockless
approach may only be possible for task_notify.
