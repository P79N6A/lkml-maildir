Just a little word of caution here.  Remember the
apache-flock-synchronisation fiasco, where removal
of the BKL halved Apache throughput on 8-way x86.
This was because the BKL removal turned serialisation
on a quick codepath from a spinlock into a schedule().
So...  I'd suggest that changes such as this should be
benchmarked in isolation; otherwise we end up spending
quite some time hunting down mysterious reports of
performance regression, and having to rethink stuff.
And llseek is *fast*.  If we're seeing significant
lock contention in there then adding a schedule() is
likely to turn Anton into one unhappy dbencher.
