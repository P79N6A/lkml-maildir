Ok I have tried it on a Pentium-M ( 32 Bit ,) with 512 MB RAM and  Core 
2 Duo with 1Gig RAM  ( running SMP kernel , 2 CPUS) with same results. 
Cant go more than ~4K addresses. I have tried them with vanilla and 
custom kernels all 2.6.19+ versions.  Results are same on both systems , 
so thats the reason I am thinking that there is some limit in kernel 
source tree which I cant seem to find . Really appreciate your help in 
this regard.
Thanks,
-d
