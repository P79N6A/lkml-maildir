   I was testing our new server (500 MHz Xeon with 512 megs of ram and IBM's
   raidcontroller). Because IBM supports only 2.2.x -kernels with their
   raidcontroller, I'm currently using 2.2.10-ac4.
   I was testing the raidarray (mainly dd:ing /dev/sda to some file on
   /dev/sdb and then copying the file around) when I decided to look at dmesg
   and saw this:
   EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): ext2_getblk: block < 0
   As I've read Linux-kernel for some time I've noted the ongoing discussion
   about fs corruption with 2.2.x, and therefore I'm asking you wheather the
   error message is in any way serious (or actually, what's causing it ;). Or
   could this be related to IBM's ServeRaid (whose linux-drivers are still in
   beta)?
No, this most commonly happens when a user process tries writing to a
file which is greater than 2GB.  The user process doing the write gets
an error, but ext2_getblk also logs a warning message, which is a bit
confusing (in this particular case, it probably shouldn't log the
error).
