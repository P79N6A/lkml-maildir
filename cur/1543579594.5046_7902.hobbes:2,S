Mine too and I think it's a good idea.  I have code in BitKeeper where I
both did and did not do that for command line options and I much prefer
the structure version.
Another habit I used to use and have fallen out of, which is a bad idea, is
one where you use a prefix in stucture files so that you can see
the difference between
	p->st_mode
and
	p->f_mode
In other words, the prefix implies the structure name.  Early versions of the
C compiler had all structure fields (I mean _all_) in one name space so this
wasn't style, it was required.  I must say that it makes code more readable.
