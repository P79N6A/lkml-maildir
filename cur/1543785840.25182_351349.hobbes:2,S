Hi
I've done a little test, I've remove this line from serial_core.c
+#ifdef CONFIG_KGDB
+       {
+               extern int kgdb_irq;
+
+               if (port->irq == kgdb_irq)
+                       return;
+       }
+#endif
and now the make modules_install works fine.
thanks for the help,
trem
