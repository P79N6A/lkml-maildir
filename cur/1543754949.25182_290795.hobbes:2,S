Hi,
>This dmesg looks like the keyboard works perfectly OK. Do new lines
>appear in dmesg when you press keys while the system is running?
eeeeeeee.....no? no, they don't. i've new dmesg for you - it reports 
timeouts while trying to perform keyboard reset (by atkbd.reset=1). 
after detection pressing any keys has absolutley no effect. maybe it's 
some timeout-violation?
