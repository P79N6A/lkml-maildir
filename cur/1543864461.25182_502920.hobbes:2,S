Using your little test app, the longest fsync() stall I can demonstrate on
2.6.20-rc4-mm1 on plain-old-sata-disk is 1.2 seconds.
What's the max stall you're able to see with the test app?
Perhaps the file is just super-fragmented.  If your production app does
something like: 
	for (a lot) {
		fd = open(name);
		write(fd, a little bit);
		close(fd);
	}
in multiple threads, or against a lot of different files then you might be
fragmenting the files a lot.  This is because ext3 discards its in-core
anti-fragmentation data structures on close().  So
- Please check your app, see whether or not it is frequently opening and
  closing the output files.
- Using `bmap' from
  
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ext3-tools.tar.gz,
  determine whether the offending files are highly fragmented.
- Tell us how much dirty data is being written out by these fsyncs?
- Try mounting the filesystem with `-o data=writeback'.  Probably won't
  help much if it's also demonstrable on ext2.
- Can you reproduce the stalls on a plain-old-disk?  Get RAID out of the
  picture?
- You've seen the stalls with both CFQ and AS.  I guess you could try
  deadline and no-op, but it sounds like that won't help.
