yeah - but m68k has been a holdout from pretty much every optional core 
kernel facility that has been introduced in the past 5-10 years. So if 
sparc32 converts to genirq we have a stronger case for saying:
   "Convert, else ..."
[ where the three dots stands for something not nice. ]
Sparc32 on the other hand had a clean IRQ layer long before x86 found its 
desire for a clean genirq layer - so genirq is a nuisance for Sparc32 at 
best and it deserves none of the not nice actions. What i am hoping for is 
that perhaps the Sparc unification changed that equation.
