I agree. However, I was not sure if anything else other than for cpu_hotplug,
needs a self-reentrent rwmutex in the kernel. 
Which is why I did not expose the locking(at least the write side of it)
outside. We don't want too many lazy programmers anyway! 
However, even in case of cpu_hotplug, if we want to prevent
a hotplug event in some critical region where we are not going to sleep, 
we may as well use preempt_disable[/enable]. Because __stop_machine_run waits 
for all the tasks in the fast-path to complete before it changes
the online_cpus map, if I am not mistaken.
Only when you want your local online cpu_map to remain intact when 
you wake up from sleep, should you use cpu_hotplug *lock*.
