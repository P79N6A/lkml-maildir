According to Paul it is fine to use RCU primitives (when accompanied
with proper comments) when the read-size critical section is guarded
by spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_lock_irqsrestore() instead of
rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() and writers synchronize with
synchronize_sched(), not synchronize_rcu(). Your patch will trigger
warnign on such valid usages.
