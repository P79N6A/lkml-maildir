    Can this be fixed?  I've *never* had to futz with initrd.
    Probably most systems are the same.  It seems a step
    backward to make it necessary.
I don't think so. It is necessary, and it is good.
But it is easy to make the transition painless.
Instead of the current choice between INITRD (yes/no)
we have INITRD (default built-in / external).
The built-in version can then slowly become smaller and die.
