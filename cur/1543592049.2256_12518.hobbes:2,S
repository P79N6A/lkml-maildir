I also point out that handling disk partitions as a -tiny- remapping
blkdev also has the advantage of making it easy to have a single request
device per hardware device (a simple remap shouldn't require its own
request queue, right?), while remapping devices flexibility to do their
own request queue management.

think of the simplifications possible, when partitions are just another
block device, just like anything else...  No special partitions arrays
in the lowlevel blkdev, etc.
