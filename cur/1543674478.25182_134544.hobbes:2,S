I have seen this with SpecJBB on high warehouse runs in around 2.5.66, I am 
testing now to see if it still exists in 2.5.69.  In 2.5.66 adding a bit to 
try_to_wakeup to relocate p-task_cpu to an idle cpu (if available) if the 
p->task_cpu is currently non idle helped dramatically.  This change is also 
in Andrea's 2.4 kernel tree I believe.  Basically in some situations, a quick 
push load balance before task activation.  
Also, in this particular case, this behavior may go away with the use of 
futexes in JVM, not sure yet, so I don't know if JVM and JBB are good 
justifications to make this change.
