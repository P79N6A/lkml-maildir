I have seen a similar problem with a Geode SC1200 based system which
basically is a GX1 and a CS5530 integrated on one chip.  I'm starting
to wonder if the same bug has popped up again in the newer chip.
Unfortunately, I haven't got access to the troublesome system anymore
so I can't test the patch.
