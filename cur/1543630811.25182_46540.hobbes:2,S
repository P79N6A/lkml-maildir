Sorry - I did omit that..
Sun E10000s are Sparc based, and 64 bit. I realize this doesn't refer to
the 32 bit boundaries, but they were operating in 32 bit mode for the initial
installation (Solaris 2.6) and since some of the filesystem support was 3rd
party and didn't work when the kernel was in 64 bit mode.
