I think both should be using ENXIO.  From the glibc docs:
 - Macro: int ENXIO
     No such device or address.  The system tried to use the device
     represented by a file you specified, and it couldn't find the
     device.  This can mean that the device file was installed
     incorrectly, or that the physical device is missing or not
     correctly attached to the computer.
 - Macro: int ENODEV
     The wrong type of device was given to a function that expects a
     particular sort of device.
