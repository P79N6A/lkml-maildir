Subject: [2.6.0-test10(-mm1)] 8139too vs. 8139cp

Hardware in question: HP compaq nx7000 (8139c+ network card), using ACPI
With the 8139too driver everything works smooth except a "please use
8139too for increased performance and stability" message on bootup.
At first 8139cp works fine, but the machine freezes after 1-2h without
any accessable oops (I'm running X, there was nothing in the logfiles).
This happened while audio or video playback (i dunno if it's related,
eth0, radeon, uhci-hcd, and intel chipset use the same interrupt).
