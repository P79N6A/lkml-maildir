Greg dropped it because he's radically changing the way he handles
patches.  I still have them around here somewhere...
Yeah, here they are.  Hm, I'd really like to stop carrying them around,
as my workload doesn't lend itself to handling these.
If you don't mind, can you create up a new connector, super-io, and
kobject-connector patch and send them to andrew for him to add to -mm?
That way I'll not have to worry about them anymore, as they keep
floating in-and-out of the -mm releases depending on the state of my
trees.  I can still handle your w1 patches, and have 2 of them pending.
Is that ok with you?
thanks,
greg k-h
