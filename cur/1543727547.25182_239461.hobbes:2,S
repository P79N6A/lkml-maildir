Thanks.
One more question, if you don't object. How after some variable 
assigment to make other CPUs *immediatelly* see the assigned value, i.e. 
to make current CPU immediately flush its write cache in memory? *mb() 
seems deal with reordering, barrier() with the compiler optimization (am 
I right?). The similar memory barrier spin_lock() does, but it's not 
easy to uderstand its internal magic.
