Subject: [bad PATCH] - arch/ppc/config.in for 2.{3,4}.* to get PCI right on G4

   The following is a little patch I've been having to
do to get development kernels to configure PCI right on
my G4. I know it's not the right thing to do, but I've
never managed to figure out what's wrong with the original;
maybe somebody who understands config-speak will know.
   Anyway, without this trick, I can't configure
tulip ethernet, firewire, etc, so I'm still wondering
if it's just all a big mistake on my part - surely
someone else should have hit this problem...
