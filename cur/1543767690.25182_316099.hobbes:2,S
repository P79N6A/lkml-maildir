If I understand your point correctly, I think this is achieved by
TIMERINTERVAL_BITS in my patch (not to claim my patch is function, but
conceptually). No matter what you actually request, the best you can do
is 2^TIMERINTERVAL_BITS nanoseconds, and usually worse because the
tick-rate and timerinterval length do not necessarily line up.
Thanks,
