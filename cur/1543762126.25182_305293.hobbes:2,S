If the SMT (apart from SMP) support is enabled in the  .config file, does 
the kernel recogonize the 2 logical processor as 2 logical or 2 physical 
processors?
Also, as the hyperthreaded processor may schedule 2 threads in the 2 logical 
cpu's, and it may not necessarily be form the same process i.e., the 2 
thread it schedules may be from the same or from the different process.
So, is there any way I can tell the scheduler (assuming I make the scheduler 
recogonize my 2 threads..i.e., it knows their pid) to schedule always my 2 
threads @ the same time? How do I go abt it?
Pls. help.Thanks in Advance.
