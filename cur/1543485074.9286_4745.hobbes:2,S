Arla's not too terrible; file accesses are intercepted and exchanges with the
AFS servers are done if necessary to get the file into the cache, from that
point on it's all local processing redirected to the cache inode until the
file is closed.  (Arla caches by files, not by blocks, which has the advantage
of speed while the file is open but the disadvantage that the entire file
has to be shuttled between the server and the client on open/close.)
The biggest speed hit in this proposal is the double network access, between
Linux and the translation server and between the translation server and the
AFS server.  The AFS-NFS translator is anything but fast, in my testing,
even when hosted on a box with fast networking.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
