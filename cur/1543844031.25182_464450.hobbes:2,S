Hi,
My new Intel E6300 with Intel DQ965GF motherboard does not boot 2.6.18-rc7, 
it just freeze at:
...........
...........
PCI: Using MMConfig at f0000000
ACPI: Interpeter enabled
ACPI: Using IOAPIC for interrupt routing
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0[ (0000:00)
ACPI: Assume root bridge [\_SB_.PCI0] bus is 0
then nothing more. It boots with "acpi=off" option, but it will lose one 
core and EIST! Fedora 5 stock kernel 2.6.15.x also have the same behavier.
The motherboard is already updated with latest BIOS.
Vanilla kernel 2.6.17.13 boot well without the "acpi=off" option.
Please cc me if possible. Thank you
Kyle
