After reading carefully the HOWTO (doh!) , my best bet is that it is a
memory probe  failure: The cardmgr is started properly and the core
modules (ds, i82365, pcmcia_core) are loaded properly (see the
/var/log/messages excerpt in  my previous postings). _Then_ inserting a card I
get OOOPsed. 
So I tried the following:

But i still got the same OOPs. I wil try to install a Win* to see the
card working there and __maybe__ i can get the params properly from
there (i.e. include only a small mem range). 
In the first place I thought it's a 3c575_cb driver problem, but
(many thanks to Donald B.) seems it's the general PCMCIA/CardBus
control code problem.

Again, my card is a 3Com Megahertz 3CCFE575BT, so AFAICT it's a
different  driver than the one for your card. But this tells me once more is
the CardBus code to blame and not a driver specific  bug.

All the best,
Florian.
P.S: Sorry for re-postings and for huge attachments. I didn't realized
that vger has such a lag (albeit understandable considering the amount 
of traffic exchanged). Apologies once more.
