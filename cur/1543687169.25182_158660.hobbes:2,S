This is an IBM thinkpad t21. the cardbus bridge is:
00:02.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1450 (rev 03)
00:02.1 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1450 (rev 03)
The problem is occurring with an orinoco gold pcmcia card.
the unable to map cs memory errors were the only odd thing in the
kernel messages, and it looks like your diagnosis was right on the
money. i these cardmgr messages:

let me know if there is more info that would be useful.
