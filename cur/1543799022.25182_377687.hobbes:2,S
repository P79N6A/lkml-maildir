I should have said up front that I don't know of any remaining
problems with 4k stacks and support switching to them. Remember, I
dusted off the 4k stack code, cleaned it up, and fixed up some of the
worst offenders in my -tiny tree well before Arjan pushed it to
mainline.
So why am I raising this idea now at all? Because I think Neil's patch
is too clever and too specific to block layer stacking and I'd rather
have a more general solution. Block is by no means the only part of
the system that allows nesting and pathological combinations surely
still exist. And will be introduced in the future.
Also note that my approach might make it reasonable to use one-page
stacks everywhere, not just on x86.

One man's fix is another man's work-around.
