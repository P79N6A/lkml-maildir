Subject: [2.6.12-rc2][suspend] resume occuring twice before suspend to suspend-to-disk

I've noticed that when I do a suspend to disk. The
machine suspends PCI devices once (I notice this
because the ipw2200 wireless card shows its
suspending, then it locks/parks the HD heads, but then
all PCI devices are woken up and resume. The HD spins
up and then dumps memory contents to swap partition,
then it suspends all devices again? :)
Is this the right behaviour?
