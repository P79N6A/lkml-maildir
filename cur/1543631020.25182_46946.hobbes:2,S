hi all,
i'm having trouble extracting a packets source and destination 
address from the sk_buff. i want to be able to see if a packet does 
in fact pass through my router.
for no particular reason i choose dev.c and a function called 
netif_rx to do this.
at the beginning of netif_rx() i added the lines:
int this_cpu = smp_processor_id();
........
        char *p;
        int i;
        
                 //  p=   (char *) (skb->mac.ethernet);
                    p=   (char *) (skb->h.uh);
then just before return softnet_data[this_cpu].cng_level;
i added this:
for( i=0; i<8;i++){
            printk(KERN_DEBUG"netif_rx() ->ethernet: %02x ",*(p+i));
            }
it complies but as soon as i pass a packet through it the router 
freezes up.
am i even on the rigth track?
regards will.
