Hi,
I would suggest to increase the 8bit waitstates in the BIOS by +1 (or
more). - you might have to increase the 16bit waitstates as well (or
instead of the 8bit ones).
It cured such a problem for me: - A Intel Pentium PC that had run Netware
3.12 perfectly happily for years didn't boot up with a CRC error after
installing RedHat 7.0 on it. - Increasing the 8bit waitstates from 1 to 2
cured the problem completely and the PC is rocksolid now. - The PC also
ran Windows quite happily (I installed it after the trouble with Linux
just to see if it would work - I was worried about the hardware having
gone dodgy.)
Hope this helps.
Regards,
	Anton
