I boot from CF in a PCMCIA sleeve. Sorry for not being clear about that.
But in any case:
even if these toshibas you mention above "fake the attached CD-ROM used for 
booting as a native IDE device", that IDE device has to be visible
after the operating system has initialized? Pretty hard to install anything
from CD-ROM otherwise...?
The way it looks to me, this is more a question about the PCI subsystem
in the toshiba.  Of course, I could be totally off base.
Anyone got any great ideas about how to beat the Toshiba into submission
and make it admit that it has the cardbus slots it just booted from?
Perhaps some poking in the magic registers of these animals?

Not sure if Jonathan still maintains the Toshiba utilities/docs, though.
