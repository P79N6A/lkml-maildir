There is a Majordomo 2 in development.  I'm using it for all of my
lists now.  The upgrade from Majordomo 1 wasn't terribly painful.
Note that it's not really a new version, but rather a total rewrite.
MIME, archives, digests, and everything else you would expect to "just
work" does.  Of course, the catch is that there hasn't been an
official, stable release yet.
