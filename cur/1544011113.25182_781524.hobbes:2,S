FWIW, how do you plan to deal with include/asm once everything gets moved
to arch/*/include/asm?
Right now O=... builds create asm-offsets.h in $(objtree)/include/asm; do
you plan to take it to $(objtree)/arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm?
Another bloody annoying thing is dangling include2/asm on such builds, along
with include/asm-x86 created on non-O=.. ones.
If/when we stop doing that and just put asm-offsets.h into arch/*/include/asm
we'll need to update the rule for kern_constants.h to
$(SHARED_HEADERS)/kern_constants.h:
	$(Q)mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	$(Q)echo '#include "../asm/asm-offsets.h"' >$@
Not a big deal, just something that'll need to be taken care of when we
switch...
