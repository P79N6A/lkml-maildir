Hi
This patchset contains next round of various UDF fs cleanups.
[PATCH 1/6] udf: udf_get_block, inode_bmap - remove unneeded checks
[PATCH 2/6] udf: create function for conversion from timestamp to timespec
[PATCH 3/6] udf: convert udf_stamp_to_time to return struct timespec
[PATCH 4/6] udf: convert udf_stamp_to_time and udf_time_to_stamp to use timestamps
[PATCH 5/6] udf: remove unneeded kernel_timestamp type
These 4 patches can be folded into one if requested, but I think it's
easier to analyze them when they are split.
[PATCH 6/6] udf: super.c reorganization
Pretty mechanical work. Can be dropped and redone if it will
conflict with someone else patch.

Jan: Are you going to create git tree for udf?
