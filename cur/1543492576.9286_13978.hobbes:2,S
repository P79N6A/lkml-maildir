I current use a HP5100C scanner that runs off of my parallel port.
Does 2.0.36 support this?  If not which kernel does and what are the
selections in the kernel config?
Oh, by the way, I am celebrating a little tonight.  I have been
surfing the web via LAN at work on Linux for quite some time, but
tonight is my first time to get PPP dialup working from home using
Linux.  Just one step closer to running FDISK on my Windoze partition.
:-D
Thanks in advance,
