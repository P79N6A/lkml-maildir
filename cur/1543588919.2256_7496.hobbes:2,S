I'm finding this report very puzzling.  Both front ends parse the
.config in exactly the same order.  In fact, it's done by the same
code.

Because of the order tree traversal is done, I think ttyconfig should give
you the effect you want.

The config.out isn't exactly compatible; it has explicit CONFIG_FOO=n settings
in it.  The .config file generated from that by configtrans should be, however;
if it's not that's a bug.  Can you send me your "incompatible" .config so 
I can see the problems?
