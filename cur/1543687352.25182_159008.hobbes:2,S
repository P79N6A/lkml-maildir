Hello,
I've been reading about SCTP for some time now and I was wondering
if I could write a simple SCTP application to get to know it better.
If possible, what do I have to get to compile my first SCTP program?
I think I need something like sctp.h and the library in glibc or
elsewhere, but I do not know where to get that.
Help and pointers would be appreciated.
Regards,
Maciej
