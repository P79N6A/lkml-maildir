Btw, what we can do is delay closing the actual revoked file until the
task terminates. This has the unfortunate side-effect that a task has
no way of freeing the resources now. But, I am beginning to think it's
not a big problem because the inode mapping will be zapped immediately
upon revoke anyway...
