Yes, this is ugly and that is why I hesitated so long before posting this patch.
But I don't see the simple and correct fix. The lock ordering is not the only
problem. In fact we don't need to take the ->it_lock in the itimer_delete() at
all. The problem is that itimer_delete() can't delete k_itimer.it.real.timer
while holding tasklist_lock, because this lock will prevent (without this patch)
the completition of posix_timer_fn(). It is unsafe to unlock tasklist in __exit_signal()
before calling exit_itimers(), and it is too late to call exit_itimers() after
unlock_irq(&tasklist_lock) in release_task(), at this moment we don't have
->signal/->sighand already.
I beleive the only sane fix would be to eliminate tasklist_lock from signal
sending path (see the patches from Paul and Thomas), but this is hard and
(I think) needs more working/testing.
Oleg.
