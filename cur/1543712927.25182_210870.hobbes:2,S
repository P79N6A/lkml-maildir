indeed, the most of the softirq load happens within irqs even with NAPI
as we were talking about, so Alexey and DaveM were wrong about the
hardirq load being non significant.
Maybe the problem is simply that NAPI should be tuned more aggressively,
it may have to poll for a longer time before giving up.

this is the one I prefer if it performs.

yep, this may be desiderable eventually just to be fair with tasks, but
I believe it's partly an orthogonal with the rcu grace period length.

I consider this as the approch number 2 too.
