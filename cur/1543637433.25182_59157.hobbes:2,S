NOT waittimeofday.  You need a *new* measure which can't be set forwards
or back if you want this to be sane.  pthreads has absolute timeouts (eg.
pthread_cond_timedwait), but they suck IRL for this reason.
Of course, doesn't need any correlation with absolute time, it could be a
"microseconds since boot" kind of thing.
