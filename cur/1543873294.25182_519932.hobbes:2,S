I have couple of comments/requests:
1. KEY_OPEN and KEY_CLOSE should not be used to signal state of the
lid, they correspond to Accpication Control Open and Close keys from
USB HID HUT spec:
     
http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/Hut1_12.pdf
SW_LID shoudl be used to signal lid state instead.
2. I also have a concern about using KEY_SCREEN to signal toggling
display on and off. I am CCing Vojtech - he must know what the
original intent of this key code was. BTW, when user presses
corresponding button - does the display actually goes off? Maybe we
need another switch.
3. The number of keymap tables grew considerably ;) Do you think it
woudl make sense to allocate memory for keymap at device creation time
and copy selected keymap and them mark all original keymaps as
__initdata so they are discarded one module completed initialization?
Thank you.
