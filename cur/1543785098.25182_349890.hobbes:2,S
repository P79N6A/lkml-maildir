James, even Christoph understands this: no HCIL in SCSI Core is needed.
The whole problem is not what you *keep grinding about over and over above*,
but the fact that I have to _invent_ channel, id and emaciated LUN to give
to the broken, outdated and Parallel SCSI-centric SCSI Core.
Christoph understand this, why cannot you?
That bitmap was added in the last moment when I needed to register devices
with SCSI Core.  There is a lot of other problems which I've pointed out
int the scsi glue file, which do you not want to talk about or you do
not bring up.
Concentrate on SCSI Core, _not_ IDR.
I hope that by the time people start plugging in hardware with more
than one LU into a SAS domain, SCSI Core's new part would not need
HCIL.  Currently SAS hardware is scarce at best.
