Yeah, I also thought about that, but here are reasons why I still think 
merging is better.
1. The added overhead is small.  It's just a dozen more if's per every 
disk io.  I don't think it will make any noticeable difference.
2. If hot path optimization is needed, it can be easily done inside one 
do_taskfile() function with one or two more if's.
3. Currently, do_rw_taskfile() isn't used by __ide_do_rw_disk().  We can 
think about optimization when actually converting it to use taskfile 
transport.  And IMHO, if hot path optimization is needed, leaving hot 
path optimization where it is now (inside __ide_do_rw_disk()) is better 
  than moving it to separate taskfile function (do_rw_taskfile()).
