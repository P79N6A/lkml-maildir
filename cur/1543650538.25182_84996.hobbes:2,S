Anyone that uses multimedia keys without X will see changes in how the
kernel handles those keys.  People who customize keymaps or keycodes in
2.4 may need to make some changes to those scripts in 2.5
A new keyboard package was released, but I haven't tested it yet to make
sure everything works.  I hacked up loadkeys and setkeycodes on my own
to get it to work, and I just haven't upgraded to the new package yet.
