Please apologize: I fear I have not specified the setups we address 
precisely enough: I think it helps to imagine the following scenario:
1. SERVER1 mounts some NFS stuff exported by SERVER2.
2. SERVER1 has two NICs.
3. The souce IP address of the related packets is the IP address 
of the NIC the kernel identifies for the outbound route, or the IP 
address specified via a static route (ip route .... src SVIPA)
4. In case no static routes are allowed and iptables NAT is no 
option, the relevant packets thus have the IP of a NIC.
5. In case the corresponding NIC dies, we have a serious problem.

It allows to configure on a per device basis via sysctl an IP address (Source Virtual IP Address - Source VIPA) that is set as IP source address for all connections for which no bind has been applied. ?To allow for NIC failover one then just needs:

This is works of course, too. But it does not solve the problem described 
above. But, maybe I misunderstood you. Please correct me, if I am wrong.

I think this is the same as the first point.

NFS works in kernel. Therefore we could not intercept the corresponding
"connect" calls. As a result, the problem scenario described above could 
not be solved.

You are right, but the packets do not come in, they go out, as I tried to 
illustrate above. Anyway, in the other case you are completely right.

Bonding offers a failover facility. For more details, please refer to:
Documentation/networking/bonding.txt in the kernel tree.
