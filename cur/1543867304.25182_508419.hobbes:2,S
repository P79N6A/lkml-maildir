the same thread is allowed to continue execution even if the system call 
blocks: take a look at async_schedule(). The blocked system-call is 'put 
aside' (in a sleeping thread), the kernel switches the user-space 
context (registers) to a free kernel thread and switches to it - and 
returns to user-space as if nothing happened - allowing the user-space 
context to 'fill the pipe' as much as it can. Or did i misunderstand 
your point?
basically there's SYSLET_ASYNC for 'always async' and SYSLET_SYNC for 
'always sync' - but the default syslet behavior is: 'try sync and switch 
transparently to async on demand'. The testcode i sent very much uses 
this. (and this mechanism is in essence Zach's fibril-switching thing, 
but done via kernel threads.)
