I will admit, I may have a failing burner.  It doesnt work well in
windows after linux... I have no burned 3 coasters because of odd errors
out of cdrecord and ruined a cdrw (can't blank it).
I get a scsi reset shortly after the "retryable" error message.  To be
honest, I don't know if it worked before 2.2.8.  Cd burning was the last
thing I used windows for (Save for an occasionaly game).  Is it possible
that the timeout messages and scsi subsystem reset are the problem and
not my burner?
