Subject: [PATCH 31/40] mm: balance_dirty_pages() vs throttle_vm_writeout() deadlock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

If we have a lot of dirty memory and hit the throttle in balance_dirty_pages()
we (potentially) generate a lot of writeback and unstable pages, if however
during this writeback we need to reclaim a bit, we might hit
throttle_vm_writeout(), which might delay us until the combined total of
NR_UNSTABLE_NFS + NR_WRITEBACK falls below the dirty limit.
However unstable pages don't go away automagickally, they need a push. While
balance_dirty_pages() does this push, throttle_vm_writeout() doesn't. So we can
sit here ad infintum.
Hence I propose to remove the NR_UNSTABLE_NFS count from throttle_vm_writeout().
Akpm's recent GFP checks don't much change this picture, any __GFP_IO|__GFP_FS
alloc can still get stalled by this. It turns into a deadlock when swapping
over NFS.
