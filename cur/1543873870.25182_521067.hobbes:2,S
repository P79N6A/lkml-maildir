Should we use "inline"? Isn't it better to leave that to the compiler?
Why the "const"?

That's better :)
But I think a simple
static char *yesno_str(bool value)
{
	return value ? "yes" : "no";
}
is to prefer, don't you? It is simpler and we don't need to deal with an unnecessary array (unless it may be used by itself, that is. Then I would go for your implementation).

Why not "(bool)value" instead? We cast all the other times we want a 
something to be of a different kind.
Any thoughts where to put a function like this?
