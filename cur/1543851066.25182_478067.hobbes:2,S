It's actually CONFIG_MII, not PHYLIB.
Probably David B. needs to resend patch 2/2.
They seem to have been lost in the noise^W recent travel.
Patch 1/2 is below.

pegasus and mcs7830 drivers use MII interfaces and should
select MII in the same way that drivers/net/ drivers do.
However, the MII config symbol should not be in the 10/100 Ethernet
menu, so that other drivers can use (enable) it or so that users
can enable it without needing to enable 10/100 Ethernet.
