It gives us a bogus value, but we know it's always there. This was
discovered in the -rt patch where we had a hard hang at early bootup.
Seems that the tracer was calling for a clock source before it was
initialized, and it called a null pointer.
The original fix was to just make a dummy timer source that returned zero.
But using jiffies seemed a better solution.
