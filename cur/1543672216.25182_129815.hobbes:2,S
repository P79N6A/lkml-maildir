Again, the throughput doesn't matter so much.
The problem is latency and fifo size.
You lost a complete frame of 1500 Byte if one IRQ is missed and you need
about 46 IRQ per 1500 byte frame. So if you only miss 1% of RX IRQ, you
loose 33% of you troughput (every 3. frame).
On a High Speed Ethernet controller with 1% IRQ loss you don't see a effect,
since you loose also only 1%.
Thats why throughput doesn't matter in this case.

Its not so bad, the problem is how do you tune the system. If you prefer to
not interrupt the IDE transfers, which seems to be the default case, you
loose IRQ latency, which doesn't matter in much cases, but not on
this. You can tune it (hdparm work also with cdwriters, since
even if it use ide-scsi, the underlying driver is the ide driver.

Yes at least you must have 4+x ms interrupt lock outs, I didn't meassure it,
but reports show that hdparm -u1 helps in much cases. Note enabling IRQ
don't say that now the ISDN IRQ will handled, here maybe other IRQs with
higher priority which are served first and add extra latency.
This all don't say that here maybe also other problems around, but I have no
better explanation.
