You pay for what you use, no less no more.  C++ compilers don't generate
bloated code `per se' but, yes, it's easier to make mistakes that degenerate
into bloatedness.

You don't need it.  And if you don't use it you don't pay for it.

Let's put it the other way... there aren't many people who know
C++ around.  Well, there are less people who understand the kernel.  Then,
maybe, to make it more accessible, we should dumb it down.

Sure :)
Someone mentioned they preferred C because they knew exactly what the
compiler would be generating.  I wonder if they got this knowledge in some
magic way, and what makes them think that they couldn't learn what C++
compilers do (at least G++) 
Of course, yes, I do agree that if the kernel is in C and putting in C++
requires more than some little localized glue or similar, C++ shouldn't go
in.
But I'll never understand this C++ aversion.
