Hi Alan,
Your compiler must really like you, seeing as it would barf on any 
significant I/O here.  Somewhere along the line, somebody removed
the INIT_LIST_HEAD for current->local_pages from fork.c and didn't
put it back somewhere else (like INIT_TASK or whatever was in mind.)
I just put it back where it was for now, not knowing what the 
original intention was.  As long as it is put somewhere...  :-)
Paul.
