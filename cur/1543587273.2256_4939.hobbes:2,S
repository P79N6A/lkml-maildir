Hmm.. I just looked at my GCC problem report from December, perhaps you're
interested, too:
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2000-12/msg00554.html
The example in there compiles out-of-the box and is much easier to
experiment on than the whole kernel :-)
It should reflect the situation in the kernel as of December 2000, where no
outputs were declared at all.
I can try this examples again with current GCC snapshots and will see if I
can find a working solution without reserving more registers.

Perhaps, I'm no real expert on this things, and "=m" worked for me, so
I used it :)
Greetings,
Andreas
