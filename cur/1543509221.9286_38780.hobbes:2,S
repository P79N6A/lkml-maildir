Hmmz very weird al this stuff.
I am using kernel version 2.3.18 (which was hard to compile, I had to
filch some scripts from 2.3.13) & 2.3.13.
My config:
ABIT BP 6
celeron 366 mhz (socket 370)
1 quantum fireball ex 3.1GB (udma/33)
1 quantum fireball ck 9.1GB(udma/66)
128MB+32MB+64MB=app. 226MB total memory
ASUS TNT2 32mb
running suse 6.2 (kernel 2.3.13 & 2.3.18)
_________________________________________
I did dd if=/dev/hde of=/dev/null 
And crashme.sh
#!/bin/sh
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  for i in hda1 hde1
    do
      dd if=/dev/$i of=/dev/null count=500000 &
    done
    dd if=/dev/hdk1 of=/dev/null count=500000
done

And now comes the weird thing, It just worked out, no lockups(at all)!!
I even compiled my kernel at the same time. (ok the load was 15.7).
The one who gets the lockup what kind of HD are you using, because I think
same HD's can't handle such bandwith (or someting like that.
Or is it just newbie(I'm just in business for approxemetly 6 months)
luck.?
So keep me informed about the lockups.
Or didn't I stressed my HD not enough? (ok there comes a very awwfull
sound from my HD buts all sound from my udma/66 are awwfull).
