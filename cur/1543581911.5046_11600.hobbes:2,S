Yes, you already said that, and I understand you very well.
My suggestion, and I have not checked the code to make sure,
but off-hand it seems to me that it should work,
is to use a partition.

Maybe. I think that you'll find that these blocks are
relative to the start of the partition, not relative
to the start of the disk.
So if you add a 1-block partition that contains the last
sector of the disk, all should be fine.
