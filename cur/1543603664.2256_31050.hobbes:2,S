Why not just say "if we have swap cache pages, we aren't oom".
If we've scanned all lists twice, we should have unmapped all users of
swap-cache pages, and we should have dropped them.
And make the test be not quite black-and-white: we're almost always going
to have a _few_ swap-cache pages around under heavy memory load, if only
because of read-ahead etc that pins the pages. But if the swap cache is a
noticeable fraction of memory, we're obviously not oom _regardless_ of
what the VM balancers say.
