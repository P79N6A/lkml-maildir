	Has anyone out there tried to move the >32GB IDE disk support
(i.e., >16-bit cylinder numbers) in the 2.3 kernels to 2.2?  It does
not look like a huge task, but if it has already been done or if
there is some reason why it would be hard to do in 2.2, I'd be
interested in hearing about it.  (We just got a 36GB 3.5"x1" drive
from the local CompUSA today.)
