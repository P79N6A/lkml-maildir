Yes, AC, NT, IOPL, ID are bad to leak.  DF / TF / RF are impossible to 
leak by privilege contract.  SF, ZF, PF, OF, CF can be clobbered.
VM / VIF / VIP are dealt with in separate switch paths (although I have 
witnessed a VIF leak once from a userspace process that managed to get 
VIF set).  These can't even be set with popf, and require iret to fix.
But 99% of the time, only SF / ZF / PF / OF / CF will be different, so 
you can avoid the popf.
