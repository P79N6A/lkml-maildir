: Why should config.guess care what vendor variant of Linux is used?  It's 
: mostly irrelevant; the differences are things which differ on other systems 
: as well and therefore should be tracked by non-Linux-specific rules.  
Because redhat/debian/slackware/suse put admin stuff in different places
and under different names.
It is useful information to see redhat/suse/etc - gnu-linux tells me
nothing more than Stallman is being a twit.  I don't really care if it
is redhat+gnu-linux or suse+gnu-linux, but it is a total lose to not
have the correct vendor in there somewhere.
