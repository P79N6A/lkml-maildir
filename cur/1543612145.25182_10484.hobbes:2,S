Hi, 
 I have recompiled the linux 2.4.7-10 kernel to get ntfs readonly support.
 this is what I entered in the lilo.conf in the fllowing order,
 NEWLY COMPILED KERNEL IMAGE
 OLD KERNEL IMAGE
 WINDOWS 	
 image=/boot/wmlinux-2.4.7-10
	label=xunil
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda2
 image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.7-10old
	label=linux
	initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.7-10.img
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda2
other=/dev/hda1
	optional
	label=windows
If you notice the first declaration of image the 
"initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.7-10.img" is not present . Of course I removed it so that there would be no kernel panic and I am able to boot into the new kernel (xunil). 
What I want to know is what is this .img file why is it required in the original kernel compilation and not in the newer . 
 Am I missing something here that could later on create problems.
All help will be gratefully ackd.
TIA,
Rohit
