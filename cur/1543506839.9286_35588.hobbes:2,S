Hi Alan,
Here is the smoking gun from 2.3.1:

This is in the middle of 'struct msqid_ds' which is exported to user
space.
Here is an outline of a solution:
(1) Copy the structure.  'struct msqid_ds' has to remain available to
    user space forever as part of source compatibility.  Name the new
    one 'struct kernel_msqid_ds' and put it inside the __KERNEL__ line.
(2) In 'struct msqid_ds', make wwait and rwait have type 'void *'.
(3) Carefully change ipc/msg.c to create msqid_ds and copy them to
    to user space.  This is not much code but just a matter of keeping
    the types and pointers straight.
(4) Do "grep -r -l msqid_ds *" at the top of the tree.  Pay particular
    attention to functions which CALL sys_msgctl, as they still have to
    use msqid_ds, not kernel_msqid_ds.  arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sparc32.c,
    arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sunos32.c, in particular.
Someone can write this up, or I can write it up this weekend.  I already
have a patch from Clemens Huebner but it doesn't handle (4) at all,
it will break sparc64.
And then after that:
(5) The Stallion character drivers have the same problem.
(6) People who copy structures to and from user space, please make real
    ABI structures, don't copy arbitrary kernel structures that have
    internal data types in them like wait queues.  Because then this
    problem happens.
