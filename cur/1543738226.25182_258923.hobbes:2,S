Hi
Followings are patches for removing bitmaps from the buddy allocator,
against 2.6.9-rc3.
This is  benefical to memory-hot-plug stuffs, because this removes
a data structure which must meet to a host's physical memory layout.
Difference from one I posted yesterday is using CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE
instead of HOLES_IN_ZONE and some fixes on comments.
This patch removes bitmaps in zone->free_area[] used in the buddy system.
Instead of using bitmaps, this patch records a free page's order in a page
struct itself using page->private field.
I removed "#define HOLES_IN_ZONE in asm/page.h" and added CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE
to Kconfig. An architecuture which has memory holes in a zone has to set this CONFIG.
As far as I know, only ia64 with virtual memmap has to set this now.
In my performance test on ia64 SMP, there is no performance influence of this patch.

============= patches for include files ==================
This patch set removes bitmaps from the page allocator.
Purpose:
This is one step to manage physical memory in nonlinear / discontiguous way
and will reduce some amounts of codes to implement memory-hot-plug.
About this part:
This patch removes bitmaps from zone->free_area[] in include/linux/mmzone.h,
and adds some comments on page->private field in include/linux/mm.h.
non-atomic ops for changing PG_private bit is added in include/page-flags.h.
zone->lock is always acquired when PG_private of "a free page" is changed.
