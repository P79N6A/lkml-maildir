Subject: 2.6.22 x86_64 : kernel initial decompression hangs on vmware
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
After upgrading kernel to 2.6.22 on a Vmware workstation guest version 
5.5 and 6 , the kernel decompression stage ("Decompressing Linux...") is 
hanging for a very long time (~5 minutes) before finally  succeeding 
(displaying "done.\nBooting the kernel.\n"). During this time, the VM 
process is eating all the CPU time during the decompression, like an 
infinite loop.
Between these 2 strings is the gunzip() function at 
boot/compressed/misc.c which does the real job, and the problem seemed 
to appear since commit 1ab60e0f72f71ec54831e525a3e1154f1c092408. 
(2.6.22-rc1 hangs, 2.6.21.6 works). The problem occurs with or without 
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE enabled.
What are the possible solutions to confirm where the problem is coming 
from ?
Thanks,
Gabriel
