Thinking about this some more this does have a significant aspect
on the design.  For architectures that support this, on the
primary kernel the command line option becomes:
crashkernel=size instead of crashkernel=size@location.
Which means the kernel needs to call alloc_bootmem instead
of reserve_bootmem.  So it results in a primary kernel implementation
difference.
In addition if we really can push all of the dump specific
functionality into user space as it appears we can, this allows a
generic kernel to be used for the crash dump process.  It will
probably still be a special hardened build where reliability is
more important than performance.  So that any micro hit we take in
performance by modifying __pa() and __va() will be irrelevant.
I like it.
I have already demonstrated that there is a general technique that
any architecture can use to build a kernel that runs at a non-default
address.  So for the architectures that cannot build a PIC kernel
there is still a proven solution available, it simply will not
be as nice to manage.
x86_64 should pretty straight forward.  i386 will be a little more
difficult but doable.
Patches are still welcome.
