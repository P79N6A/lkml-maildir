kbuild is told to visit these directories - and then it build an empty
.o file to make linking step possible.
The only solution is to tell kbuild not to visit these directories
unless they are in real use.
Following untested patch should do the trick. But the media people must
check if before being applied since I have only taken a brief look at
the Kconfig and Makefile files.
