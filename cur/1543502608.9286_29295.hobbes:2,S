And what if you have to interact with something through a library, such as a
database API?  You can't use select/poll, nonblocking/async IO in those cases
since you don't have direct access to the underlying IO mechanisms.

Depends on the design.  I can see how threaded applications can be difficult
to test and debug, especially with a dirth of good thread aware debuggers.
Most things have their drawbacks I suppose.
