Just wondering ... should we really be returning HANDLED?  What if the
IRQ is shared?  Will the hardware de-assert the level interrupt when it
puts the device in reset (ie is this a transitory glitch?), or do we
have to cope with a screaming interrupt?

Hm.  If we need to call pci_set_master, then we're also going to need to
call pci_set_mwi (if appropriate) which is currently done in
sym_set_workarounds().  Except you don't have a sym_device, or a
sym_chip around at this point.  Bother.  Need to do some refactoring to
take care of that.

I like the first unlikely ... but I'd drop the second one.  If they are
both ffff ff, I'd say it's quite likely ;-)  Anyway, the first unlikely
is good enough a hint to GCC, IMO.
Thanks!
