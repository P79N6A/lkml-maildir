just to clarify this, that's not my idea of "deprecated".
"deprecated" means that there *is* a complete replacement available
*right now* and you should consider switching to it.
if you can't offer someone a completely functional, better alternative
to what they're using now, then you can't say that what they're using
now is deprecated.
