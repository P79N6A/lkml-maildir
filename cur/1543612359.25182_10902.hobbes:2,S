Hello,
Maybe not for this list but I would appreciate any help
I have two Linux 2.4.10 boxes on the same subnet 10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0
1) 10.0.0.1
2) 10.0.0.2
My goal is to run PPPoE so the client is 10.0.0.1 and server is 10.0.0.2. On
both hosts kernel is compiled with experimental pppoe support. I have
dowloaded pppd and run into configuration problems. As I am an absolute
beginner it would not make much sense to list the problems here. If someone
tried the same scenario as I am trying I would appreciate any help
So
How exactly to setup pppd to use pppoe kernel module (all pppxxx modules I
did insmod)?
Cheers!
Rade
