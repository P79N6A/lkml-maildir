the buffers will hold a reference on the page. So the pagecache is
either in the LRU with refcount > 1, or the refcount is 1 and the page
is not in the lru.
In short Ben's patch was useless but it was faster and cleaner than what
we had before with the special page_cache_release, and so it was good.
Said it in another manner: we'll never effectively free a page that is
in the LRU, unless it's an anonymous page (no brainer for
sendpage/sendfile).
Hugh's patch is definitely valid and it's a nice bugcheck to have, it
should be merged IMHO (it's in a slow path), but there's no bug to fix I
think, the bugcheck is paranoid-in-slow-path kind of thing.
