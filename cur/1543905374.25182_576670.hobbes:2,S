 Look for calls to ->throttle() and ->unthrottle().  XON and XOFF might be 
used instead as a result of these calls though, depending on terminal 
settings.

 Well, the UART only has its FIFO which is rather small, so automatic flow 
control would be useful.  Though, admittedly, tty_insert_flip_char() might 
return some kind of a status related to how much space is left in the 
receive buffer which would indicate that there is a lag in data stream 
processing -- which in turn may relate to the system being loaded, so that 
the receive ISR could decide whether to negate RTS itself for the less 
capable UARTs (i.e. ones with no autoflow and a tiny or no FIFO).
