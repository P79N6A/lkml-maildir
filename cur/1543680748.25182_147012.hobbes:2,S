I just went from 2.5.70 to 2.5.75 and discovered that sound no longer
works. After short period of investigation, I found that "/dev/snd" is
pointing to "/proc/asound/dev" that now, for some unknown reason, is gone.
'dmesg' shows
> ALSA device list:
>  #0: Intel 82801BA-ICH2 at 0xe800, irq 9
And '/proc/asound' seems  to be there, aswell.
> siim@void:/proc/asound$ ls
> I82801BAICH2@  card0/  cards  devices  oss/  pcm  timers  version
But no 'dev' there. I am also missing those control0* stuff. Strange...
Can anyone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?
I used exactly the same .config for both kernels:
#
# Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
#
CONFIG_SND=y
# CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER is not set
CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL=y
CONFIG_SND_MIXER_OSS=y
CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS=y
CONFIG_SND_RTCTIMER=y
# CONFIG_SND_VERBOSE_PRINTK is not set
# CONFIG_SND_DEBUG is not set
# PCI devices
CONFIG_SND_INTEL8X0=y
# Open Sound System
# CONFIG_SOUND_PRIME is not set
