whee, an si_swapinfo() maintainer.
Your function sucks :)  I'm spending 15 CPU-seconds
in there during a kernel build.  The problem appears
to be that a fix from 2.4 hasn't been propagated
forward.
2.4 has:
                if (swap_info[i].flags != SWP_USED)
and 2.5 has:
                if (!(swap_info[i].flags & SWP_USED))
and I think the 2.4 version will fix the accounting
problem you're seeing?
(I haven't checked whather it's the _right_ fix, but
it looks like it'll make it go away?)
