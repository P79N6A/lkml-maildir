I believe you misunderstand the configuration I was thinking about:
eth0.1000        br0
     |             |
eth0 with VLAN stripping
Its slightly different that I thought though, __vlan_hwaccel_rx
drops packets for unknown vids, so as soon as you configure a VLAN
locally on the same device that is used for a bridge, no VLAN
packets will be forwarded at all.
Slightly inconsistent with how other layered devices work, but
can be avoided by adding the VLAN to br0.
