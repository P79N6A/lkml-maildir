Could be just a development glitch on my part, but there were times (IIRC)
I would not get a dump from a fault inside the interrupt handler, but I
would get the report of the killing of the interrupt handler.
Seems that I need to start recording the issues I've had with a kernel bug
not dumping a stack and doing a panic (which did nothing). And then I can
get back to you ;-)
