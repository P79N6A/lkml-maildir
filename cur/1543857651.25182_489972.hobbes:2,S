Please calm down a bit. I didn't claim that glibc should be linking to
libnl. glibc is obviously a special case which can simply copy the existing
macros into some internal compat header just like any other application
that doesn't wish to use any of the libraries available.
The point is to stop new applications from using the interface which has
resulted in buggy code in the past.
