well, since i am using only devfs and i don't see (personaly) any reason
to continue standard /dev directory structure i didn't wrote that part,
but if somebody really want it - patches are welcomed.
I've tried to remove all unneded parts, make it more kernel style of
programming compatible.
new version is on the same place where older one was, as i assume it
does not make sense to keep old one.
