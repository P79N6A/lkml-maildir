Let's rephrase that a little more accurately, shall we? "Andre knows
perfectly well that MOST disks out there will have their warranty
invalidated by running software which allows unrestricted access to the
RESERVED vendor-specific functions in the ATA spec."
Even MS protects their customers from this sort of damage. Failure to do
so is fscking stupid, dangerous, and likely to end up with dead penguins
lining the road. It's even possible that just running Linux on an IDE HDD
will void your warranty ATM - do you REALLY want that??
