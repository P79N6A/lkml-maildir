oh, OK, whatever, that's easy.  I dropped the old patch and queued this

-What:	PCMCIA control ioctl (needed for pcmcia-cs [cardmgr, cardctl])
-When:	November 2005
-Files:	drivers/pcmcia/: pcmcia_ioctl.c
-Why:	With the 16-bit PCMCIA subsystem now behaving (almost) like a
-	normal hotpluggable bus, and with it using the default kernel
-	infrastructure (hotplug, driver core, sysfs) keeping the PCMCIA
-	control ioctl needed by cardmgr and cardctl from pcmcia-cs is
-	unnecessary, and makes further cleanups and integration of the
-	PCMCIA subsystem into the Linux kernel device driver model more
-	difficult. The features provided by cardmgr and cardctl are either
-	handled by the kernel itself now or are available in the new
-	pcmciautils package available at
-
