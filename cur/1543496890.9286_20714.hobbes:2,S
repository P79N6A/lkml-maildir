One option would be to provide a separate open-source module that can
be compiled as part of the kernel, and whose only task is to call the
non-versioned routines in your module. The said module would then set
itself up to depend on the binary-only module.
Probably a more realistic option would be to split your binary module
into an open source header routine and a binary only module that the
header routine calls, with the latter containing all the proprietary
stuff.

I'm no kernel expert, so the above is just my personal thoughts...
Best wishes from Riley.
