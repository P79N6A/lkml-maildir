That's why I think that any process that holds a lock should have its
priority boosted to just above all other SCHED_OTHER/SCHED_IDLE
processes. This should be done not only for SCHED_IDLE processes but
also for those with a policy of SCHED_OTHER.

It's ok that SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO processes can kill the system.
They have to be root to do it, and it doesn't surprise anyone. As long
as SCHED_IDLE is available to root only, it's somewhat ok for it to be
able to kill the system. It's surprising though, and that is bad.
It is not ok for SCHED_OTHER processes to be able to penalize other
processes unfairly. That really should be fixed.
