Ouch... would creating another semaphore or flag 'dumping_core' work
or is that jut a bad idea?
I ask this because like it or not; people use threaded applications
and having threaded core dumps would be cool. Requiring a copy to
dump isn't really elegant or an option if you run a process who's RSS
is 400M on a 512MB machine as I do.
