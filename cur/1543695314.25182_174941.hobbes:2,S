At first I wasn't sure.  I noticed that the drive was behaving differently
when I told dd to use bs=4096 instead of 512.  Until seeing Oleg Drokin's
message about ReiserFS, I thought that the drive itself was doing something
differently.  That didn't make much sense to me because the physical sectors
are much longer than 4096 and the pseudo-sectors are the conventional 512,
so why did 4096 cause different behaviour?  From Oleg Drokin's message, I
guess that the use of 4096 might make a difference in the sequence of
read-modify-write cycles involved in the logical write operation.
This doesn't seem like a complete answer, but I don't think I'll ever know a
complete answer.
