I'm not sure this works, since the use count also counts for skb's,
icmp_error_track(), makes the skb refer to this conntrack in case of
success, intentually not calling ip_conntrack_put(). 
So now I'm clueless, although I'm almost certain it's a use count
problem. I'd be happy to hear from Rusty or someone on the netfilter
mailing list about this.
