> That's pretty specific. I dont think this comes under the umbrella of statistics as such. Sure it can be modified to do it but I was looking for a tool to find where specific latency hotspots still exist. Of course I'm not capable myself of tackling the actual hotspots but those who code those areas certainly can tackle them knowing what firm data shows.
Guess so. Thought it might be nice to have a measurement of worst case
latencies across various functions ... I'll have a play with it, and see
if I can come up with something.
