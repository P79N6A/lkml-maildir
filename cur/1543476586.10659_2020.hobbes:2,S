Another way to fix the thing could be to left only to kswapd the work to
sync shared-mmapped page out to disk when needed. We could wakeup kswapd
from the inside of filemap_swapout... It's dirty but should work fine
without the need of reentrant semaphores. BTW, before my
always-async-swapout idea kswapd was hiding the bug pretty well ;). 
Personally I like far more the clean solution but...
