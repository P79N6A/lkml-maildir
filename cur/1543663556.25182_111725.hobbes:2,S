Oh, it's definitely different hardware.  Maybe the 16550-related portion
of the ASIC is the same :) but just do an lspci to see huge differences in
motherboard chipsets, on-board parts, more complicated BIOS, remote
management bells and whistles, etc.  Even the low-end rackmounts.
But the better margins come simply from the mentality, IMO.  Desktops
just aren't "as important" to a business compared to servers, so IT
shops are willing to spend more money to not only get better hardware,
but also the support services that accompany it.  Selling servers
to enterprise data centers means bigger, more concentrated cash pool.
