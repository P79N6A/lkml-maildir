Subject: [patch] scheduler cache affinity improvement for 2.4 kernels

i've attached a patch that fixes a long-time performance problem in the
Linux scheduler.
it's a fix for a UP and SMP scheduler problem Alan described to me
recently, the 'CPU intensive process scheduling' problem. The essence of
the problem: if there are multiple, CPU-intensive processes running,
intermixed with other scheduling activities such as interactive work or
network-intensive applications, then the Linux scheduler does a poor job
of affinizing processes to processor caches. Such scheduler workload is
common for a large percentage of important application workloads: database
server workloads, webserver workloads and math-intensive clustered jobs,
and other applications.
If there are CPU-intensive processes A B and C, and a scheduling-intensive
X task, then in the stock 2.4 kernels we end up scheduling in the
following way:
    A X A X A ... [timer tick]
    B X B X B ... [timer tick]
    C X C X C ... [timer tick]
ie. we switch between CPU-intensive (and possibly cache-intensive)
processes every timer tick. The timer tick can be 10 msec or shorter,
depending on the HZ value.
the intended length of the timeslice of such processes is supposed to be
dependent on their priority - for typical CPU-intensive processes it's 100
msecs. But in the above case, the effective timeslice of the
CPU/cache-intensive process is 10 msec or lower, causing potential cache
trashing if the working set of A, B and C are larger than the cache size
of the CPU but the invidivual process' workload fits into cache.
Repopulating a large processor cache can take many milliseconds (on a 2MB
on-die cache Xeon CPU it takes more than 10 msecs to repopulate a typical
cache), so the effect can be significant.
The correct behavior would be:
    A X A X A ... [10 timer ticks]
    B X B X B ... [10 timer ticks]
    C X C X C ... [10 timer ticks]
this is in fact what happens if the scheduling acitivity of process 'X'
does not happen.
solution: i've introduced a new current->timer_ticks field (which is not
in the scheduler 'hot cacheline', nor does it cause any scheduling
overhead), which counts the number of timer ticks registered by any
particular process. If the number of timer ticks reaches the number of
available timeslices then the timer interrupt marks the process for
reschedule, clears ->counter and ->timer_ticks. These 'timer ticks' have
to be correctly administered across fork() and exit(), and some places
that touch ->counter need to deal with timer_ticks too, but otherwise the
patch has low impact.
scheduling semantics impact: this causes CPU hogs to be more affine to the
CPU they were running on, and will 'batch' them more agressively - without
giving them more CPU time than under the stock scheduler. The change does
not impact interactive tasks since they grow their ->counter above that of
CPU hogs anyway. It might cause less 'interactivity' in CPU hogs - but
this is the intended effect.
performance impact: this field is never used in the scheduler hotpath.
It's only used by the low frequency timer interrupt, and by the
fork()/exit() path, which can take an extra variable without any visible
impact. Also some fringe cases that touch ->counter needed updating too:
the OOM code and RR RT tasks.
performance results: The cases i've tested appear to work just fine, and
the change has the cache-affinity effect we are looking for. I've measured
'make -j bzImage' execution times on an 8-way, 700 MHz, 2MB cache Xeon
box. (certainly not a box whose caches are easy to trash.) Here are 6
successive make -j execution times with and without the patch applied. (To
avoid pagecache layout and other effects, the box is running a modified
but functionally equivalent version of the patch which allows runtime
switching between the old and new scheduler behavior.)
stock scheduler:
  real    1m1.817s
  real    1m1.871s
  real    1m1.993s
  real    1m2.015s
  real    1m2.049s
  real    1m2.077s
with the patch applied:
  real    1m0.177s
  real    1m0.313s
  real    1m0.331s
  real    1m0.349s
  real    1m0.462s
  real    1m0.792s
ie. stock scheduler is doing it in 62.0 seconds, new scheduler is doing it
in 60.3 seconds, a ~3% improvement - not bad, considering that compilation
is exeucting 99% in user-space, and that there was no 'interactive'
activity during the compilation job.
- to further measure the effects of the patch i've changed HZ to 1024 on a
single-CPU, 700 MHz, 2MB cache Xeon box, which improved 'make -j' kernel
compilation times by 4%.
- Compiling just drivers/block/floppy.c (which is a cache-intensive
operation) in parallel, with a constant single-process Apache network load
in the background shows a 7% improvement.
This shows the results we expected: with smaller timeslices, the effect of
cache trashing shows up more visibly.
(NOTE: i used 'make -j' only to create a well-known workload that has a
high cache footprint. It's not to suggest that 'make -j' makes much sense
on a single-CPU box.)
(it would be nice if those people who suspect scalability problems in
their workloads, could further test/verify the effects this patch.)
the patch is against 2.4.15-pre1 and boots/works just fine on both UP and
SMP systems.
please apply,
	Ingo
