Kernel 2.6.12.5:
1- 400GB Seagate 8MB cache, 7200RPM, ATA/100 drive.
2- ATA/133 Maxtor (ATA/Promise Controller)
1) Attached 400GB to Seagate 400GB drive.
2) (Not mounted yet)
3) See below
hde: 781422768 sectors (400088 MB) w/8192KiB Cache, CHS=48641/255/63, 
UDMA(100)
4) Partition with fdisk (hde1).
5) mkfs.xfs /dev/hde1
*** KERNEL FREEZE *** (ENTIRE MACHINE LOCKS UP)
Do the SAME EXACT THING on the motherboard (INTEL) controller or an 
ATA/100 Promise Controller, there are NO problems.
Either people with this problem are *not* reporting it or do not know 
where to report the problem to.
This is the second machine I have seen this problem with.
Has anyone looked into this?
Justin.
