But, Richard, it does not matter of it is 100%, you have not right to ask
that your name be on it. Example: If I use Debian to create a new distro
and I call it george Linux, even though 100% of it comes from Debian, I
have no requirement to call it Debian/george Linux.
You claim has no basis. I am free to take GNU grep and call it preg if I
want. 
On this subject, please go away.
