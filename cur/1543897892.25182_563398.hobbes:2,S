Well, yes, I don't have much need to include ELF headers in asm now, but 
I still think its worth separating the arch-specific definitions from 
asm/elf.h and all the other stuff they pull in.  Specifically, the 
structure forward declarations and constants have very few external 
dependencies, but the structure definitions - particularly the 
arch-specific ones - have very wide dependencies, which is what I'm 
trying to solve.  Very few pieces of code care about the arch-specific 
structures.

No, that's not the real problem; its a side-effect of the real problem.  
The real problem is that linux/elf.h ends up bringing in too much.  
arch/powerpc, for example, has its own stripped down copy of elf.h for 
bootloader stuff in order to avoid this extra crud.  The fix is to make 
it possible to get just the appropriate ELF definitions without getting 
everything else.
There's the secondary problem that lots of ELF stuff is copy'n'paste 
duplicated across all the architectures, but all they really care about 
is one of two sets of parallel definitions (32 or 64 ELF structures).  
That was the secondary

Well, it seems like a large fiddly patch which only solves part of the 
problem I want to solve; actually it doesn't help me at all, but it 
achieves one of the side-effects of my patch. The arch changes make it 
look pretty awkward to merge.
