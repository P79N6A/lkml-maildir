I really don't understand why fs-cache is always rejected. Actually it is the 
perfect solution for NFS booted systems - you have a big cluster of nodes and 
in order to minimize administration overhead the nodes are booted over NFS 
from one common chroot. With unionfs (preferred solution here is unionfs-fuse) 
one then maintains files required to be differently by different clients.
Caching files on the local disk minimized the network access and boosts the 
performance, so at least for this usage example fs-cache would be great.
(Actually I have been thinking about to implement a caching branch into 
unionfs-fuse, but if the kernel can do it on its own, it is also fine.)
In the past David already posted many benchmarks and just a few weeks ago 
again:
