The current one is readable, which is good, and Linus asked for it,
which makes it kinda moot.  And really, if you compile a module with
M686 and insert it in a kernel with M586, *WHATEVER* scheme you we use
for CPU seleciton, I want the poor user to have to use "modprobe -f".
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
