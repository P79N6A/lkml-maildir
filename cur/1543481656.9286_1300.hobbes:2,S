This one is quite old. I hoped to track it down myself, but no luck yet.
If the MTU on a ppp link is set to 296 (to reduce broken packets) and
the MTU on the local ethernet is left at 1500 access to the outside
network becomes very erratic.
Logins sometimes stall, connections hang on large dir's.
Dropping the MTU on the local ethernet to 296, the same as the ppp-link
and everything works again.
And yes, IP-defrag is on.
If anyone can suggest ways to track this one down, let me know, it's 
very easy to reproduce.
I'm fairly confident it's not a ppp-problem, connections from the
machine running as the masq server via ppp are always fine (modulo the
occasional problem caused by packet breakage).
This certainly affects 2.2.0-pre-8 and 2.1's as far back as I can remember.
I wouldn't call it a show stopper by any means as the defaults for
ppp and ethernet mean it doesn't normally occur.
