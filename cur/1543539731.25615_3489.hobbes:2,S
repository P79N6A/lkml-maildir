Darn. I just realized that I did, in fact, do that. Mea maxima culpa -
when I took BKL from the do_mmap() I've totally missed the fact that not
all instances of ->mmap() were SMP-safe. Worse yet, during the
BKL-shifting in ->release() I found ones that were not, fixed them and
_still_ did not realize that the rest may have problems. The only
semblance of excuse being that it was an oversight (read: sudden idiocy
attack), rather than decision to break it now and fix afterwards ;-< Oh,
well... Self-LART commenced, list of instances that still need fixing made
(fortunately it turned to be very short - only 1 left, drm_mmap() in
drivers/char/drm/vm.c), patch goes to Linus. Oh, and you have my
apologies.
