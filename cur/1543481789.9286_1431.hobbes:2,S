You, sir, are a hacker supreme!
Not only does this patch eliminate freezing, it has doubled or tripled the
effective load time for every web site I've tried.  Since setting up with
cable-modem service, I've blamed persistant stalls and pages which never
seem to load on network conditions outside my ISP.  
You have uncovered the true culprit <g>.  Thanks VERY much for searching
this out.
