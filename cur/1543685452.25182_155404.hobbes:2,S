	Hello Larry ,  Could we please put a 'annotated' button at
	
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/
 &
	
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/
	in the search function ?
	Doing a search for sym53c8xx_2 in ChangeSet comments get me
	output that is a little bit odd to read ( see below) .
	ie: Note the lack of formatting after the Rev position .  Not all
	entries are like this but if the Rev string is long they all are .
ChangeSet        1.1046.398.19[PATCH] make sym53c8xx_2 not reject autosense IWR
ChangeSet        1.1046.398.19This patch makes sym53c8xx_2 silently ignore the Ignore Wide Residue
ChangeSet        1.1046.398.16[PATCH] small patch for sym53c8xx_2
ChangeSet        1.1046.398.16dma64_addr_t in the sym53c8xx_2 driver was wrong, but it's still
...
