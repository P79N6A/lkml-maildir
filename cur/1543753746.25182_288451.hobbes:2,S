Well, I know that current code works. It was produced by C compiler,
btw. Now, new code works for you, but it was not in kernel for 4
releases, and... this code is pretty subtle. And it is hand-made, not
C produced.
So... your code may be better but I do not think it is so much better
that I'd like to risk it.
