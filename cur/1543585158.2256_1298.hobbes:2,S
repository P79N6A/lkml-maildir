No, I tried both SMP and non-SMP version of kernel, the machine is however
single processor Athlon 900. CONFIG_ACPI is not set, CONFIG_APM is not
set. The 2.4.3pre4 still performs 66M/s without "the load" and 124M/s+
with  load. However there is much different between 2.4.2 and 2.4.3pre
about 33M/s to 66M/s.
