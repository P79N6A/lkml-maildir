IIRC it is more complicated than that. Free fall is too late, laptop
usually fall from 1meter. Thats not enough time to park the
heads. Fortunately, laptop usually tilts before it falls off the table
-- and they are measuring the tilt before the fall. That buys them
enough time to actually do anything with it.
Story says, that they once had version that worked from 2meters+. It
was kind of useless, because no laptop ever fell from that height and
those that did were destroyed anyway.
[ s = a t ^ 2.
  s = ~1m.
  a = 9.8m*s^-2.
  t = sqrt( s/a )
  t = 
ucalc> (1 m / (9.8 * (m * sec ^ (-2)))) ^ 0.5
OK:  0.319438  sec
...ouch, it should be way faster, 0.3sec is definitely enough to park
heads.]
