   Oops, I used 2.6.14-rc4-mm1, I'll retest.  However, this does work on
the Superdome.  Not because of the iterating over the nodes code, but
because of the call to alloc_bootmem_low_pages() fallback case.  Adding
a printk(), I get this:
Node 0: 0xe000074104e6b200
Node 1: 0xe000082080723000
Node 2: 0xe000000101532000  *Note this is the interleaved memory node
Placing software IO TLB between 0x4cdc000 - 0x8cdc000
Looking at the memory map of the system, I see these major ranges:
Node 2:
0x00000000000 - 0x0007ffdefff (~2GB)
0x00100000000 - 0x0017fffffff (2GB)
0x04080000000 - 0x040f0000000 (2GB)
Node 0:
0x74100000000 - 0x741fbbfffff (~4GB)
Node 1:
0x82080000000 - 0x820fb453fff (~2GB)
So, it looks like we're iterating over the nodes, but
alloc_bootmem_node() isn't even guaranteed to try to get memory from the
low memory on that node.  Thanks,
	Alex
