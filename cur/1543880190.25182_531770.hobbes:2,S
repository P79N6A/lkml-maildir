Both my T30 and R51 aren't waking up when I open the lid any more. I
have to hold down the power button for a moment. On my R51, I see this:
$ cat /proc/acpi/wakeup
Device  S-state   Status   Sysfs node
LID       S3    *enabled
SLPB      S3    *enabled
PCI0      S3     disabled  no-bus:pci0000:00
UART      S3     disabled  pnp:00:09
PCI1      S4     disabled  pci:0000:00:1e.0
USB0      S3     disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.0
USB1      S3     disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.1
AC9M      S4     disabled  pci:0000:00:1f.6
..so it ought to work?
