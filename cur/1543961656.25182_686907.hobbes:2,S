It does seem pretty bad to create the same-named function in two
architectures, only with sometimes-different argument types.
A minimal fix would be to make powerpc's implementation be an out-of-line C
function which takes a resource_size_t and which calls ioremap_flags()?

I'm not a big believer in making new code match broken old code.

I blame Rusty.

whatever ;)
