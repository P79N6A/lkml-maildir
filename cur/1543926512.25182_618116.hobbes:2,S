Hmm, something strange going on here. With this patch applied on top of 
2.6.24-rc2-mm1, I can't see no lockup or warning from kobjects code, which 
is good. But this happens:
...
Creating device nodes with udev
resume device  not found (ignoring)
Waiting for device 
/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_HDS722516VLSA80_VN6D3ECDE5BD9D-part6 to appear:  
ok

in short write).

        (i.e., without -a or -p options)
Error writing block 1542 (Attempt to write block from filesystem resulted in short write).                                                                                         
(and this keeps looping forever).
However the very same kernel, with the very same .config, but with just 
	gregkh-driver-kset-convert-block_subsys-to-use-kset_create
	gregkh-driver-kobject-remove-subsystem_register-functions
	gregkh-driver-kset-remove-decl_subsys-macro
reverted, boots perfectly fine.
