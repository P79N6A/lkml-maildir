I haven't seen any other reports of this, but fdisk is suddenly unable to 
figure out the geometry of unpartitioned SCSI drives with 2.4.15pre2!  It 
comes up complaining that the number of cylinders must be set at the 
expert menu.
If I reboot with 2.4.10-ac12 it works as it always did; assuming a 
reasonable geometry and permitting me to partition the disk.  Once 
partitioned, it IS recognized correctly by the newer kernel.
Quite repeatable.
