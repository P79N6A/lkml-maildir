Oops, turns out this doesn't work.  data_ready is never NULL, look at
how netlink_kernel_create() works.
Also, the broadcast case probably needs to be handled
too?
As an aside, to be honest what's so wrong with the socket receive
buffer filling up?  The damage is limited to the receive buffer size
of the kernel netlink socket, but that's it.
