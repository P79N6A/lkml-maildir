Can cpu affinity really be changed for a running process ?
Does it need something like io or yielding to take effect ?
I am playin with Robert Love's taskset (symlinked to runon, it is easier
to type and I'm more used to it), because I want to play with hyperthreading
and wanted a method to force two threads on the same physical package.
It works fine to bound a new process to a cpu set, but I does not change
anything for a running process.
I try runon -c -p 0 <pid> for my numbercruncher and it does nothing, top
shows it is in the same cpus where it started:
werewolf:~# runon -c -p 0 8277
pid 8277's current affinity list: 0-3
pid 8277's new affinity list: 0
werewolf:~# runon -c -p 8277
pid 8277's current affinity list: 0
The program uses posix threads, 2 in this case. The two threads change from
cpu sometimes (not too often), but do not go into the same processor
immediately as when I start the program directly with runon/taskset.
Any idea ?
TIA
