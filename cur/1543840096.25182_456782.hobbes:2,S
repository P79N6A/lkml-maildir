Nice.
The SUSE kernel has a crasher module that is also quite useful for testing.
What it does basically is to always allocate/free memory and overwrite
the memory and check if the memory hasn't been changed by someone else.
Perhaps something like that could be incorporated into your framework too?
I put a copy of the suse patch in

However I'm not sure they're too useful right now.  The problem is
that they're too global and might render the system unusable. Have you
considered adding some more filters, like uid/gid to fail only (
I think that would be useful because then it would be possible
to run test suites with faults while keeping other parts of the system
functional) or maybe even a list of callers to test? e.g. only
failing for module foo would be nice.
