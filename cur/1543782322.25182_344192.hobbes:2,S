Yes, hacks like that often causes a long non-preemptible section because
code that was only intended to run on boot now gets hung off a timer and
can run in the middle of real work.
I have an EPIA 6000 with a via Rhine and I've never seen this bug, so it
must be something specific to your network.  Better to find the bug and
fix it rather than add stupid hacks.
