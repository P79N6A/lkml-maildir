It's not that insane: the address space is allocated at open time.
After you drop it with BLKFLSBUF you will have to open the device again
to reallocate a new address space. I could just truncate the physical
address space, there are no other users, but then the inode would remain
pinned forever, and so until we include your ipinning fix this looked an
acceptable two liner band-aid I guess (again, real fix is yours, all I'm
saying is that it can't oops any longer ;).
thanks,
Andrea
