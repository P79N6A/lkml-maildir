No, this is the result of a serious problem with gitweb.
We run gitweb behind a cache (otherwise it would be unacceptably 
expensive), but when httpd starts timing out on gitweb, it spawns gitweb 
over and over and over again, and the load on the machine skyrockets, 
throttling other services.
This happens every time we're on one server instead of two (one server 
is down right now for network rewiring.)
I think for now I'm just going to put a loadavg cap on running gitweb...
