Hi all,
I am encountering a strange situation with IPv6. I have
a simple server which creates a PF_INET6/SOCK_STREAM socket,
binds it to a sockaddr_in6 with sin6_port 12345 and sin6_addr
in6addr_any, then listens on it and accepts a connection.
As expected, I can establish an IPv4 connection to this server
from a purely IPv4 client. The problem is, in that case, getpeername
on the server correctly returns a struct sockaddr with sa_family == AF_INET6
*but** the contents for that address do not correspond to the
IPv4 client's address (whereas it should contain the IPv6-mapped
form of the IPv4 client address).
IS this a known problem?
Feel free to ask for more information or source code...
Thanks for your help,
Thomas.
