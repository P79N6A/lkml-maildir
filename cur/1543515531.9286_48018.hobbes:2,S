It's in here...

Still required as of 2.2.14prex.  I also am wondering if this stuff will
make it into the 2.2.x kernel proper.

???  That's a pretty big hit!  For me it's ~16MB/s vs ~6MB/s, and quite a
difference in CPU usage also.  It of course depends on the hard drive - I
have one of those IBM 13.5GB 7200 jobbies, with an advertized sustained
throughput of 16MB+/s, so I'd guess a faster drive will also be utilized
quite well.

Has been perfectly so for me *so far* - I've been running it for less than
two weeks.
