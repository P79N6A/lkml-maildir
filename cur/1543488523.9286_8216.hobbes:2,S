Assuming you're not suggesting calling the daemon synchronously, then
there still is a delay between when the FS starts getting full, and
when the daemon can start purging. The delay between this and when
free space becomes available may be a significant fraction of a second
(especially if a lot of small files need to be deleted to make room
for a big one). So polling once or twice a second might not have any
significant impact, anyway.

And I still wonder whether you really need to bury this in unlink(3)
rather than rm(1).
