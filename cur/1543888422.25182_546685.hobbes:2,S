of course we'd like to use exactly as many (or few) nodes as are in use right 
now and without fixed limit for their number; which implies that nodes should 
appear and go on as needed basis.
But right now there is no kernel mechanism that user level program could use 
to request allocation of new loop node. I won't discuss whether it is 
legitimate to mandate new version of util-linux for kernel 2.6.22; but it is 
obvious that any kernel patch that adds such mechanism goes far beyond simple 
bug fix and is not acceptable at this stage.
So let's revert this change and discuss it for post-2.6.22 timeframe.
