Subject: [PATCH 0/15] CFQ IO scheduler patch series
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I have a series of patches for the CFQ IO scheduler that I'd like to get
some more testing on. The patch series is also scheduled to enter the
next -mm, but if I'd like people to consciously give it a spin on its
own as well. The patches are also available from the 'cfq' branch of the
block layer tree:
git://git.kernel.dk/data/git/linux-2.6-block.git
and I've uploaded a rolled up version here as well:
http://brick.kernel.dk/snaps/cfq-update-20070424
The patch series is essentially a series of cleanups and smaller
optimizations, but there's also a larger change in there (patches 4 to
7) that completely rework how CFQ selects which queue to process. It's
an experimental approach similar to the CFS CPU scheduler, in which
management lists are converted to a single rbtree instead.
So give it a spin if you have the time, and let me know how it performs
and/or feels for you workload and hardware.
