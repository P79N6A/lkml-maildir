Good job.

I think your #1 is "obviously correct", but the fact that it breaks rmdir 
sounds like a bummer. However, since it only breaks rmdir when 
silly-renames exist - and since silly-renames should only happen when you 
have a file descriptor still open - I'd be inclined to say that this is 
the right behaviour.

This sounds like a hack, even if it happens to work.
I dunno. I'm personally inclined to prefer (1), since that seems to just
fix a bug in the VFS layer and doesn't introduce any conceptual
complexity. But I think I'd let Trond make the final decision, I don't 
hate (2b) enough to say "over my dead body!".
Trond?
