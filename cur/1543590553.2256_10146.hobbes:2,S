Sounds like someone has just clarified what the heck it means.  "tty"
and "typewriter" aren't exactly the same thing (even though "tty"
stands for "teletypewriter" it has come to mean something completely
different in a Unix context)... "not a typewriter" is just a
completely confusing error message for the uninitiated.
