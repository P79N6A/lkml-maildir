No. Check the numbers first, d_lookup() doesn't do anything heavy (it just
follows a linked list of entries - even assuming a lot of cache misses
that would probably imply more dentries than you can fit in 512MB).
Basically, if d_lookup() takes 80ms, there's a bug somewhere. Don't try to
paper it over by adding "reschedule" calls. 
The bug may be a completely buggered hash function or similar. 
Or the bug may be the latency measurement.
In either case, trying to add band-aid over it is the wrong solution.
