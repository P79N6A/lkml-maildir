Huh?  What if my cipher consists of XOR-ing with a k-bit pattern?
That's a permutation on the set of k-bit blocks but it happens to
decompose as a product of (non-overlapping) swaps.
In general for more realistic block ciphers like DES it seems
extremely unlikely that the cipher has only a single orbit when viewed
as a permutation.  I would expect a real block cipher to behave more
like a random permutation, which means that the expected number of
orbits for a k-bit cipher should be about ln(2^k) or roughly .7 * k.
