i know.  believe me, i *know that*, since i'm fairly sure it was my
observation that initially started that discussion about isdn4linux.
i did make it clear in that previous post that all i was doing was
listing stuff in the source tree that is currently marked with
"obsolete" or something like that, with no regard to any discussion
that's taken place about it recently.
all i was interested in was feedback along the lines of, "oh, yeah,
*that* feature is thoroughly dead and can be tossed," nothing more.
