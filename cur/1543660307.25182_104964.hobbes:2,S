Only while installing a new kernel. And you install the kernel on the
box it needs to run on, which is not necessarily the box it's compiled
on.

Only for stand-alone machines which only ever compile and run one
kernel. You don't need a data center to violate that, you just need
the fairly usual three-boxes home network (one of which is mainly a
router/firewall which has no development environment if only for
security reasons, or because it's a scavenged '486).

Frankly, I think the main reason is that Linus doesn't care at all
about the kernel build process. We've had a _much_ better solution
already in the 2.5 cycle which was rejected for completely bogus
formal reasons coupled with an explicit "why do we need this at all",
even though it was pointed out over and over again what is broken
currently (or was back then, granted it has improved but not as much
as is desirable and possible).
This blatantly erroneous decision[1] just smells of a blind spot or
carelessness more than careful consideration.

[1] it's about of the same category as the original Unix' designers
putting utmp and wtmp in /etc. Linus would never have approved _that_.
