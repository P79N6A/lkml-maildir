Ingo, you happily still ignore my primary issues, how serious do you

That would assume the choices are mutually exclusive, which you haven't 
proven at all.
To put everything in yet another perspective: We have the kernel full of 
security hooks, which are likely more invasive than any trace marker ever 
will be. These security hooks are well hated by a few developers, but we 
merged them anyway, because they are useful.
So the big question is now, why should it be impossible to create and 
merge a well defined set of markers, which can be used by any tracer?
bye, Roman
