As said before, the i/o probe isn't that intrusive, and tries to back
off as soon as the thermit charge becomes warm ...

udelay() could work by eg setting an irq routine than upon receipt of a
char sends another, and enabling loopback mode. Then by counting how
many times the irq is called during some time interval, measured by
udelay(). This is pretty clumsy, though.

I'm not sure how much precision we can get in userland. On the other
hand, this might be an interesting feature.

Guess I'll have to try sometime. :)

* The question is: Are there any PCI serial cards, that say 'serial       *
* controller' as class, '16550' as prog-if, and don't have a single       *
* 16550-like interface on each of their i/o address regions and base-baud *
* of 115200?                                                              *
I think there are not any such beasts, but it has to be proven by evidence.
(As said before, the base baud condition isn't that importand.)
So, if no, all these cards can be treated as generic-pci-serials. I
think all other cards can be handled by the table, because they are not
going to be that numerous, hopefully.
