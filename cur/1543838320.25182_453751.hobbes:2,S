The Coverity Checker spotted the following obvious NULL dereference:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int cypress_probe(struct usb_interface *interface,
                         const struct usb_device_id *id)
{
...
        if (dev == NULL) {
                dev_err(&dev->udev->dev, "Out of memory!\n");
                goto error;
        }
...
}
...

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
