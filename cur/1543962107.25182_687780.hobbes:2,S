Subject: [GIT PATCH] hwmon update against v2.6.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus:
Please pull from:
	git://lm-sensors.org/kernel/mhoffman/hwmon-2.6.git release
You'll get a relatively small number of minor changes, all of which have been
in -next for many weeks.
Also, there is a larger pile of changes queued in my email, most of which have
been reviewed by other hwmon contributors even.  It is absolutely my fault for
not getting through this pile by now.  To all hwmon contributors, I apologize.
I have done a crappy job as maintainer this past month.
Linus: I'll ask you to pull again between rc1 and rc2, in order to kill that
backlog.  However, I understand if you choose to reject that request.
Thanks & regards,
