So if apache were using a listen()/clone()/accept()/exec() combo rather than a
full listen()/fork()/exec() model it would see most of the same benefits?
Some additional overhead for the user/kernel syscall path but probably
pretty minor, right?
Or did I miss a piece of data, like the time to call clone() as a function
from in kernel is 2x or 10x more than the same syscall?
