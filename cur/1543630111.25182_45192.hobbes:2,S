    It depends on an application.  It certainly shouldn't be the default, but
   a user may choose such an option for some reason.  E.g. for debugging a
   system with an ICE or a similar tool.
   
He's talking about how SIG_IGN should behave.
If you want non-default behavior, specify a signal handler instead
of SIG_IGN.

    Why should we enforce policy on a user?  If one wants to ignore such
   signals for whatever reason, let him do that. 
   
We don't specify any policy other than the behavior of SIG_IGN which
is to kill off the process for SIGBUS.
If you specify a handler you can have SIGBUS do whatever you want it
to.  There are no enforced limitations, only a specified behavior
for SIG_IGN when used for SIGBUS.
The original poster has solved his problem, yet you continue to argue
one and on and on.
