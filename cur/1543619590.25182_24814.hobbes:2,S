We could do it something like what I did with inflate_fs -- build it
as a module if the kernel proper doesn't need it (and modules are
enabled.)
It *does* mean the configure rules need to contain these dependencies,
though.
crc32 is an interesting case... you can create code to make the tables
with a very small amount of code.  This saves space on disk, but not
in memory; in fact, if you can't jettison this code you lose in
memory...
