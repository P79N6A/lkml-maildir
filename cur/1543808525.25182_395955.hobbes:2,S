That all makes sense.
To make uswsusp a success you need it tested [T], supporting scripts [S], 
someone [B] who puts work in the webpages [W] with decent documentation [D], 
and a bunch of spiffy features [F].

I, as a contributors to suspend2, have been working on all that stuff for 
about two-and-a-half years, and it makes me really sad to see that someone in 
a position to make a decision towards progress wants to start that whole 
process all over, rather than acknowledging the existance of a technical 
superior solution - including a well-functioning supporting community - and 
working towards getting this solution available for a wider audience.
Judging from experience, uswsusp is probably two years away until it can even 
come close to what suspend2 offers right now, and that would be the ideal 
case of having a lot of people helping in the progress, involving being 
actively involved and dedicated to fixing problems.
