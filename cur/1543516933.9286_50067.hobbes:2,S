Try it! strace vi 2> /dev/null gives good overview of that
situation. And yes it is nicely usable.
Worst-case slow down (and I mean worst-case) is 10 times. That is not
_that_ bad.

Ioctls should be banned. They make network transparent remote exec
hard, for example. Disabling all ioctls for user-level applications
should not hurt too much.... [clapity clap] Hmm, it will: console
operations are done using ioctls. Ok, disallowing ioctls is not possible.

Who is expected to read such a huge ammount of logs? ;-)
