ok:-)
But if the the timestamp doesn't have to be entirely accurate
the name should perhaps reflect that, since at least on the cris arch
you can save some cycles if you can accept a glitch now and then.
We want to be able to separate it from similar functions used
for high-res timers etc. which need a more accurate function.
