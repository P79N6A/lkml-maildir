Because I want to deal with weird cases like :
kernel calling tracing code, causing a user-space page fault, which
calls the tracer, which could be interrupted by an NMI, it would become
tricky to find out how many contexts could be stacked in the worse case
for each architecture. Therefore, using a cmpxchg-based algorithm is the
solution I used. However, in order to make this fast, I extented the
"local atomic operations" to offer a local_cmpxchg.
