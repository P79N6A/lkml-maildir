That seems like a good plan to me - they really don't want that cross-node
balancing. It might be cleaner to implement it by just tweaking the 
cross-balance paramters for that system to have the same effect, but it
probably doesn't matter much (I'm thinking of some future case when they
decide to do multi-chip on die or SMT, so just keying off 1 cpu per node
doesn't really fix it).
