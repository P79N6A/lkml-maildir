   Wow, nice dream. And please share you experience from 
organic farming with others in need (e.g. me)
  This (Perl 6 OS), with khttpd, would allow a complete 
web-server in kernel mode, so we could get rid of apache/mod_perl. 
Furthermore, if the OpenBios project goes further along, we could 
have not linux booting linux, but a perl bios! And when you would 
want to update your bios, you could use perl's CPAN shell!
   Just my (inspired by your dream) thoughts.
