I want a true ip_id from the kernel and this id will not be used by
any other packet.
Although there are few chances that our randomly chosen ip_id collides
with the other packet's ip_id generated by kernel, I don't want this
possibility to happen.
So is there any method to get a true ip_id from the kernel? 
I want this ip_id to do my own fragmentation on a packet.
Thanks!
Xinwen
