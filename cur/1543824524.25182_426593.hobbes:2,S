We use it in Fedora/RHEL if a module is loaded that hasn't been gpg signed.
It's been handy to spot things like 3rd parties replacing jbd.ko with
their own variant in bug-reports.
The signed modules stuff went over like a lead balloon when that was posted
last time.  Pushing the bit of the patch that describes the taint flag
may make sense though to make sure there aren't collisions like this.
I agree there is scope for confusion here, and imo kernel.org should be
the canonical place where these flags are defined, even if the kernel.org
tree doesn't actually use them all.
