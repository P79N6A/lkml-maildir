Hi, 
I just was browsing the code I found that in the follwoing functions
./kernel/signal.c:void __init signals_init(void)
./net/core/soc.c:void __init sk_init(void)
kmem_cache_create is called by there is no check in what they return, that
is, they do not panic() if they can't create cache entry, wich seems to me
wrong
Thanks
	Ulisses
