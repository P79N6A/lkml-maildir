Jan, what's the policy on people writing their own debugging printk systems.
I've looked at what other file systems do, and found out that it varies a
lot: some use a simple mapping wrapper from printk->dprintk, while others
define complex ways to have debugging levels/bitmaps where users can
selectively decide (say, by a mount option), what debugging output they'd
like to see or not.  Here's a small sampling of what some file systems use:
9p/fid.c:		P9_DPRINTK(P9_DEBUG_VFS, "fid %d dentry %s\n",
autofs/inode.c:		DPRINTK(("autofs: shutting down\n"));
lockd/svcproc.c:	dprintk("lockd: GRANTED_RES   called\n");
ncpfs/dir.c:		DDPRINTK("ncp_lookup_validate: result=%d\n", val);
nfs/client.c:		dprintk("<-- nfs_free_client()\n");
nfsd/export.c:		dprintk("found domain %s\n", buf);
partitions/efi.c:	Dprintk("GPT my_lba incorrect: %lld != %lld\n",
Not much standardization there :-) but "dprintk" does appear to be the more
common use.
I wanted something simple to allow me to not printk something that's just
for informational/debugging purposes, but w/o having to #ifdef the printk in
question, or define a complex debugging-level printk system.
Now, looking at pr_debug (in linux/kernel.h), and indeed some filesystems
(e.g., affs and configfs) use it.  But pr_debug is only active when #define
DEBUG is on (not CONFIG_DEBUG).  I didn't see a config option that enable
DEBUG: is there one?
From other file systems, it appears that the more common convention is for
filesystem XYZ to offer a config option CONFIG_DEBUG_XYZ, which makes its
debugging more self-contained and keeps the config option closer to where
the f/s itself is enabled.
Thanks,
Erez.
