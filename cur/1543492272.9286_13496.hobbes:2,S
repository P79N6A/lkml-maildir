Hi Riley.

I believe 700Mb is too much for kernel image, etc.: I can run two
processes simultaneously each one malloc'ing and intensively memset'ing
its own (1GB - eps) without Any swapping.
BTW 700Mb looks like a hardcoded constant - it is always the same
(0x2aaab000) with the only exception: systems with 3:1 split prefer to
start allocation at smth like 0x4000b000.
Alexander.
