I think netlink is perfect as it is for now. 
Our scheme just demonstrate how flexible is this code.
Before being added "permanently" (I don't like this word) we should get
out with something better than an alpha release. :)
But, even if the process is long, we are still working on it. 
And hopefully one day it will be possible to try Netekeeper easily
on your own network (I have to admit now that the user-space tools are
difficult to get to work, even if I trust a lot the kernel-space code).

Yes, this is true, but it doesn't matter so much for experimental things
(in my humble opinion).
