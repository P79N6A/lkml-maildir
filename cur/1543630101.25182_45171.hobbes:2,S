Subject: how to redirect serial console to telnet session?

I have an embedded box with serial console.  I have a debug version of a driver
that wants to dump so much stuff to console that the poor serial can't keep up
and I can't run other commands.
I would like to redirect the stream of stuff going to the console to a telnet
session over ethernet.
Accordingly, I grabbed what looked like the important bits of xconsole, but it
appears that this only gets me stuff written to /dev/console from userspace. 
How do I go about getting the output of kernel-level printk()s as well?
Thanks,
Chris
