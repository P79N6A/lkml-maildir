Andre,
Here's the info you called about today.  The DVD next door is a SCSI (I
thought it was an ATAPI device, but it's SCSI).  The other burner with
the speed=8 problem is the MATSHITA and it is an ATAPI device.  Here's
the technical info.   This is the drive that returned all the packet
corruption errors I posted Saturday on 2.4.0.
Jeff
