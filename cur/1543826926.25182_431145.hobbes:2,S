The implementations in mainline generally use all the bits or they'd
have been fixed by now so its not really a problem. I'm sure Russell
would take patches :)

This is where you start to add ugly ifdefs and generally start making
the code look horrible. The device model separated the drivers and the
devices to deal with this issue as I see it. Generally I'd say its
cleaner just to let the device register, then if a module comes along at
some later point, the device is there for it.
