Right.  Those messages will call attention to pieces of code that you need to 
pay special attention to, or which are more complicated than they need to be.
99.9% of the theorems that need to be proved are completely trivial.  The only 
ones that are at all complicated as a group are the ones involved in ruling 
out infinite loops.

If you're serious about this, you'll prove them by hand, or simplify them to 
that they can be proved automatically.
