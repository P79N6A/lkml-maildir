Hi all,
  I'm writing a driver which uses also kernel_threads
and file operations (/dev and /proc).
I was not able yet to find out why and when to use
[un]lock_kernel()
Can someone please give me a hint where to find some
infos in using lock_kernel() for 2.2 and 2.4.
What exactly is/must be protected by lock_kernel() ?
Thanks,
Armin
