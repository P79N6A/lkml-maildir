Ummm, unless the code is actually part of Linus' kernel tree (which I don't
think it is), this should not be mentioned in the main section.  If you want to
add a separate section of modules available elsewhere (usb, pcmcia), etc. thats
ok.  Otherwise, you will continually get people saying we lied about the USB
support.

Umm, 2.0.3x has support PCMCIA for some time (or else I'm dreaming that the
office laptop I use which runs 2.0.36 supports PCMCIA modem, lan, and scsi
cards).  IRDA is no longer a separate module.
You probably should put a web site for further information, including one that
outlines all of the utilities you need to upgrade (linuxhq for instance).
