It is until you have very stateful filesystems.  Then you have to have
persistent storage somewhere that tells you what the heck you were
thinking of last time you created a filehandle.  You end up doing a table
lookup, dispatch, and possibly a copy on every incoming packet.  You never
know when a client has finished with a file.
All of the problems with the user-space NFS server should be sufficient
evidence that NFS is limited at best as an abstraction for arbitrary
filesystems.
