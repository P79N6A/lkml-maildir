One I like to name of the file system to be something else. This way apps
can move over to it. You will still be able to do the above. I plan to
have for each framebuffer
/dev/gfx/frameX. 
So say your card can do double buffer you could do 
cat /dev/gfx/frame0 > file1
cat /dev/gfx/frame1 > file2
So you could access the double buffer as well :-)
