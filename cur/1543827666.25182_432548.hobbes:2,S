Great! Show us how. I'd be delighted to use it here.

Didn't say that. Spammers /are/ finding ways to fool greylisting, that is
all.

I don't know where you got the idea I consider SPF a "single point
solution". FYI, here we use greylisting, spamassassin, ClamAV (much junk is
malware), and blacklists (both local ones and via DNS). We analyzed SPF and
rejected it a while ago as unfixably broken. No "single point solution" in
sight, sadly.
