Very useful, thanks.  Without it, we would be shutting out the 99.99%
of the Linux universe who never use Git.
Git is really only used by a handful of core developers -- that's who it
was built for and by.  Sure, there's dozens or even a couple hundred names
in that handful now, but a heck of a lot more people never use git,
and never should have to use git.
Cheers
