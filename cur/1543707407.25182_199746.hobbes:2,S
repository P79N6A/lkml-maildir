It's clear this could be fixed by making sure parport won't call
request_module from cleanup_module, the primary reason I fixed it in the
module code is that I don't know if other drivers are doing this, do
you? What parport did was legitimate, and it was working fine in the
past, sure the parport code could be made slightly more complex and
aware about the fact it doesn't worth to try loading the lowlevel module
in cleanup_exit, but it wasn't obviously wrong, the cleanup/init module
are slow paths, it didn't matter if parport tried to load a lowlevel
module there.
