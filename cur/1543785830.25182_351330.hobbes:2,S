Subject: [PATCH] Fix bd_claim() error code.

Problem: In some circumstances, bd_claim() is returning the wrong error code.
If we try to swapon an unused block device that isn't swap formatted, we get
-EINVAL.  But if that same block device is already mounted, we instead get
-EBUSY, even though it still isn't a valid swap device.
This issue came up on the busybox list trying to get the error message
from "swapon -a" right.  If a swap device is already enabled, we get -EBUSY,
and we shouldn't report this as an error.  But we can't distinguish the two
-EBUSY conditions, which are very different errors.
In the code, bd_claim() returns either 0 or -EBUSY, but in this case busy
means "somebody other than sys_swapon has already claimed this", and
_that_ means this block device can't be a valid swap device.  So return
-EINVAL there.
