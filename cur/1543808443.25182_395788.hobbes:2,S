The quoted sentence certainly implies _at_least_ that much.

However, I don't think this is a reasonable interpretation, and it's
clearly _not_ the one that Joerg is implying.
Joerg is claiming that the quoted sentence also implies that
_different_ st_ino/st_dev pairs will _always_ identify different
files.  Taken in just the immediate context of stat.h, this is a
very reasonable interpretation.

If you want to show that his interpretation is incorrent (which it
may be for all I know), you need a better argument than this.
