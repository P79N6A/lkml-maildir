Various ksymoops patches.  The main change is support for sparc and
sparc64 (I hope) plus the ability to do cross system Oops decoding.
Patches tested on ix86, untested on other architectures.
patch-ksymoops-2.0.gz is against 2.0.  It also fits 2.1 and 2.2 up to
and including 2.2.2-ac2.  You may get offset differences on the top
level Makefile, ignore them.
patch-ksymoops-2.2.2-ac3.gz is the same patch, reworked to fit 2.2.2-ac3
and upwards.
Feedback to kaos@ocs.com.au, please include "oops" in the subject.
