The whole *point* of the sys_call_table "abuse" was to avoid having
the whole damn lot in the export list!
As a side effect it meant that any module that patched the
sys_call_table (funky tracers, security hot-fixes, whatever)
would work seamlessly with non-Linux binaries.

I can't see why? iBCS always was a module for years before
linux-abi dumped it back in a humungous kernel patch.
