I set this up on a Debian box quite a while ago, before the packaged
stuff, but it's trivial to implement this in the hotplug scripts and
works fine - simply do a "pppd call adsl" after you've had the
firmware loader squirt down the firmware. The issue here is "what if I
have a weird setup where at init time the device is found but the
firmware loader or pppd are not available then" - well in that case
I'd argue that the system is broken because you can't expect something
to be available at init if you don't help it to be so.
Sticking pppd on an NFS volume in the original example is overly
contrived and unlikely - it'd be like me sticking fsck on an unmounted
NFS volume and expecting to be able to write some reasonbly generic
and portable initscripts. Let's have cool stuff like udev - but let's
also have some limits with potential startup headaches by having some
utilities fixed.
Cheers,
Jon.
