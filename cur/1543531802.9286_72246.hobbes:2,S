Yeah, some other people have noticed this. I can reproduce it with a simple
test. I'm sure the blockdev and VFS gurus are aware of it, but they've been
strangely silent. I've had a quick look and am horribly confused. I tried
mapping out the bits of the call tree which looked relevant and got as far as
 this ..
user app calls write(), etc.
  sys_write
   generic_file_write
    __grab_cache_page
     page_alloc
      __alloc_pages
       zone_balance_memory
        try_to_free_pages
         shrink_mmap
          try_to_free_buffers
           wakeup_bdflush(0 = don't block)
         swap_out
    block_prepare_write
     create_empty_buffers
      create_buffers(async)
       run_task_queue(tq_disk)
       wait_event(buffer_wait, ..)
     ext2_get_block
     ll_rw_block(loop dev owned bh)
     wait_on_buffer(loop dev owned bh)
    generic_commit_write
     __block_commit_write
      atomic_set_buffer_dirty
      mark_dirty
      balance_dirty
       wakeup_bdflush(0 or 1)
.. and gave up :-) Maybe what I should really be doing is writing some
documentation as I go along which shows which functions are re-entrant and
which aren't.
