This morning I wondered, why I was using a list to drop the dentry's inodes
after the dput() has visited all parents.
It is not enough to fix prune_one_dentry() to hold the lock until the parent
is dereferenced since prune_one_dentry() calls __dput_locked(). And in
__dput_locked() we have the same problem again:
from __dput_locked():
                list_del(&dentry->d_u.d_child);
                dentry_stat.nr_dentry--;        /* For d_free, below */
                /*drops the locks, at that point nobody can reach this dentry*/
->              dentry_iput(dentry);
                parent = dentry->d_parent;
                d_free(dentry);
                if (dentry == parent)
                        return;
                dentry = parent;
+
+               if (atomic_read(&dentry->d_count) == 1)
+                       might_sleep();
+               if (!atomic_dec_and_lock(&dentry->d_count, &dcache_lock))
+                       return;
+
+               spin_lock(&dentry->d_lock);
                goto repeat;
        }
  }
Between -> and the atomic_dec_and_lock() the reference count on the parent is
wrong and no lock is held. I fixed that by using d_lru to keep track of all
dentry's which inodes still have to be dereferenced. This should happen after
all parents have been dereferenced.
