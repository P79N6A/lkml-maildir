	Same here. Not with diskless boxes, but with normal boxes.
	However, it seems to be more a client problem than a server
	(our servers are Solaris or Linux 2.2.1-ac6 machines).
	The client in our case is a 2.2.2-ac7.
	A more thing I have observed with that client against
	the 2.2.1-ac6 knfs server is data corruption (I have
	sent a email about that problem, but I think it has
	been lost somewhere). When compiling, data read from
	the server is corrupted : it is sometimes the content
	of some random data in memory (content of /etc/termcap
	for example). Never happened with a 2.2.1-ac6 client.
	I have also trouble using autofs. It takes really a long
	time to remount umounted partition (between 10 and 15 secondes).
	Again, never happened with a 2.2.1-ac6 client. Nothing in the
	logs, nothing on the console.
