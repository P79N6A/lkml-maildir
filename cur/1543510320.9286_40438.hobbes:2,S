I've seen the same with 2.2.12pre6 here, AMD K5, PCI-NE2k Ethernet, 48mb
RAM, S3-Virge. Installed is a heavily customized SuSE 5.3 (libc5), gcc
2.7.2.3
The Lockups occured without X, without ppp (I've been offline that
time) and the machine ran lokal mail, http and dhcpd, main use via ssh.
ssh connections and console (no fb) stopped dead, nothing in the logs,
nothing on screen, magic sys-rq did'nt respond, only pushing the
reset-button helped.
Can't use serial-console as both serial ports are in use (modem and
mouse).
