No.  y2k compliance *must* be mentioned.  Anyone starting to
use a product nowadays will want to know whether it is compliant.
Not referring to it in a press release will appear a little
suspicious...
It should be referred to, and also the fact that Linux has *always*
been compliant.  That solves the problem. :)
