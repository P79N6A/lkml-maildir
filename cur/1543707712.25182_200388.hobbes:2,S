Hi,
I had kernel 2.4.22-ac4 + laptop mode patch 
and it worked perfectly.
Now I'm on a 2.4.24 kernel where the aforementioned
patch has been merged in, but it seems
that it does not work properly,
I've set bdflush as follows:
cat /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
30 500 0 0 60000 60000 60 20 0
cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode
1
and using
echo "1" > cat /proc/sys/vm/block_dump
in syslog there are only such messages:

.

that is only journaling is writing to my HD
and anyway every minute more or less something
gets written to HD preventing it from being spinned down
thx Cristiano
