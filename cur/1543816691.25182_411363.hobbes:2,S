We use lighttpd on our servers, and I can say with 100% that this problem 
happens alot. Because of this , we were forced to use to userspace mechanism 
that the lighttpd author made to cirvumvent this issue. However with this 
patch, I'm unable to produce any of the problems we had experienced before. 
IO-Wait has dropped significantly from 80% to 20%. 
I'd be happy to send over some benchmarks if need be.
