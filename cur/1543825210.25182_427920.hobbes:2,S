Since this document reveals no information about such a MAC device, it is 
still unknown whether forcedeth is truly to blame. From the silence of the 
original poster I'm inclined to assume he's fixed the problem..
I was suspicious because in contra to the original post, it is NOT the case 
that Windows XP (even SP2) will automatically detect and support NVIDIA 
ethernet; a third party driver must be installed before the device is usable. 
Realtek chips, however, tend to work out of the box..
