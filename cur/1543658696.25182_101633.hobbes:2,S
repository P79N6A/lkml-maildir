The 'emulation' really defines the linker-script to use. The name
is pretty much a misnomer. Different architectures require different
linking parameters and you can force the linker to provide a `a.out`
(ZMAGIC) output as well as ELF.
Execute  `ld -V` and the linker script will be displayed. If you
do `ld -V -m x` it will show the emulations provided, on ix86
machines, it's i386linux (for a.out) and elf_i386 (for ELF).
