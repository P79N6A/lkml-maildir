Should be ok to remove it.  I only see fb_find_mode using it, and as
you've concluded, usage is not very clear.
BTW: The global_mode_option, previously, is filled up when no driver is
specified in the boot options, such as "video=1024x768@60".  But this was
removed during the fb initialization cleanup.
