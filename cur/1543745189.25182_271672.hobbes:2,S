If you think it is fixable in userland, please write at least the pseudo
code that you believe should work.  We have spent quite a lot of time
on that code and don't believe this is solvable in userland.
E.g. the futex IMHO must be incremented before FUTEX_WAKE, as otherwise
the woken tasks wouldn't see the effect.
I believe the only place this is solvable in is the kernel, by ensuring
atomicity (i.e. queuing task iff curval == expected_val operation atomic
wrt. futex_wake/futex_requeue in other tasks).  In the RHEL3 2.4.x backport
this is easy, as spinlock is held around the user access (the page is first
pinned, then lock taken, then value compared (but that is guaranteed to
be non-blocking) and if equal queued, then unlocked and unpinned.
In 2.6.x this is harder if the kernel cannot allow some spinlock to be
taken while doing user access, but I guess the kernel needs to cope
with this, e.g. by queueing the task early but mark it as maybe queued
only.  If futex_wake sees such a bit, it would wait until futex_wait
notifies it it has decided whether that one should be queued or not.
Or something else, whatever, as long as the right semantics is ensured.
Just FYI, current pseudo code is (not mentioning cancellation stuff here,
code/data to deal with pthread_cond_destroy semantics, timedwait and
pshared condvars):
typedef struct { int lock, futex; uint64_t total_seq, wakeup_seq, woken_seq;
		 void *mutex; uint32_t broadcast_seq; } pthread_cond_t;
pthread_cond_signal (cond)
{
  mutex_lock (lock);
  if (total_seq > wakeup_seq) {
    ++wakeup_seq, ++futex;
    futex (&futex, FUTEX_WAKE, 1);
  }
  mutex_unlock (lock);
}
pthread_cond_wait (cond, mtx)
{
  mutex_lock (lock);
  mutex_unlock (mtx->lock);
  ++total_seq;
  ++futex;
  mutex = mtx;
  bc_seq = broadcast_seq;
  seq = wakeup_seq;
  do {
    val = futex;
    mutex_unlock (lock);
    futex (&futex, FUTEX_WAIT, val);
    mutex_lock (lock);
    if (bc_seq != broadcast_seq)
      goto out;
  } while (wakeup_seq == seq || woken_seq == wakeup_seq);
  ++woken_seq;
out:
  mutex_unlock (lock);
  mutex_lock (mtx->lock);
}
pthread_cond_broadcast (cond)
{
  mutex_lock (lock);
  if (total_seq > wakeup_seq) {
    woken_seq = wakeup_seq = total_seq;
    futex = 2 * total_seq;
    ++broadcast_seq;
    val = futex;
    mutex_unlock (lock);
    if (futex (&futex, FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE, 1, INT_MAX, &mutex->lock, val) < 0)
      futex (&futex, FUTEX_WAKE, INT_MAX);
    return;
  }
  mutex_unlock (lock);
}
