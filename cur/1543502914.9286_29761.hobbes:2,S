The gcc asm uses the ATT command-set. Therefore it's backwards from
Intel Assembler.
The asm extension puts text into the intermediate code that gcc
generates, i.e., do `gcc -S -o att.asm program.c`. The result is
that you have to put in some '%' characters to show that registers
are registers. There are numerous examples of such assembler in
../linux/arch/i386/* and ../linux/include/asm/*.h
FYI, your code snippet above sets a segment register from the contents
of some memory operand. This is something that you probably don't want
to do in Linux. If you do, you move it directly :
		mov es, [some_variable]
