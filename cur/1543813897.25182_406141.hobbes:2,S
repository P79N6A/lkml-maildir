Hi all,
Here comes an 8-piece patch set for the zoran drivers. The first 7 of
these were already posted to the mjpeg-users and video4linux lists two
months ago [1], the last one is new. There are both fixes and cleanups.
Andrew, Ronald says he is too busy these days to deal with my patches,
but otherwise he was OK with them. Could you please take them in -mm so
that they get wider testing? Then we'd be able to merge them.
