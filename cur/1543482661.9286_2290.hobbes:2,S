Hmm, 2.2.0-pre9 also dies on `/lib/ld-linux.so.2 --verify "./core"`.
core was rather old, about four weeks, and ldd 1.9.9 worked without
problem today morning. Before running this ldd2.0 that there was 84KB
in swap, I do not know whether swap was used today morning, but I think
that it was.
  Kernel is compiled as SMP, but only one CPU here. I have to revert down
to pre8 and older...
  And of course, before reboot there was 'bad pmd_ ...'. I have to turn
matroxfb acceleration off to read whole message, it reboot very quickly.
                                        Best regards (?),
