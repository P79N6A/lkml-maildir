I was taking my cue here from ext3 which does something similar. The
filemap_fdatawrite() is done by the VFS before this is called with a
filemap_fdatawait() afterwards. This was intended to flush the metadata
via (eventually) ->write_inode() although I guess I should be calling
write_inode_now() instead?
