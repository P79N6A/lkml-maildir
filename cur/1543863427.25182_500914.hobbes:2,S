That's fixable.  Just bias in favor of the already active
pages and only let pages with a clearly smaller interreference
distance replace them.

Your CART-r seems reasonable, too.

Getting rid of swappiness is a very good thing, IMHO.
I have heard about a few customer workloads that required
changes to swappiness in order for the system to be able
to handle their workload at all.
Systems should not have to be tuned like that...

Yes, this is always a problem.  I am not aware of any complete
test cases to test page replacement.
It would be easy to simulate some database by having part of
the dataset be the index and referencing that in an r^2 way,
and the rest being the data which is referenced less.  At that
point you can see how taking frequency into account helps.
However, tests like that are simply not complete.  They are
not representative of the things most people do with their
system.
Something like AIM-7 suffers from the same problems...
Anybody?
