Did you change that since you posted the patch?  Sounds like a larger
change than the one I'm proposing.

Sure.

I can deal with the change going into -git, but it does seem awkward
knowing that it is the wrong change and it will be replaced by something
else almost immediately.
My main concern is that the Xen patch queue is complex enough as-is, and
I've been trying hard to remove dependencies on other uncommitted
patches.   It's doubly complex because I'm not really sure if I'm
targeting Andrew or Andi's tree as a base, though at the moment -git
seems to work either way.
