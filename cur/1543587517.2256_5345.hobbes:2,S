No, I will be busy fixing the hole that allows to get untrusted code loaded.
I don't give a fsck whether it's a virus or not - if admin authorized it
it's his responsibility, if not - ability to get it into the kernel space is
a gaping hole that should be closed.

Yes, it is. It's a kernel counterpart of open() - the only difference
is that instead of installing a reference to file into descriptor
table and returning the descriptor it returns the reference itself.
Arguments are the same as in case of open() and it's certainly there
to stay.
