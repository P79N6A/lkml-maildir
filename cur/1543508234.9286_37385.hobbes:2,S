I'd like to offer a way for user level programs to be informed of state
changes on the USB bus. (ie device plugging in, device unplugging, new
bus registered)
I can think of a couple of ways to provide this, but I'm unsure what
would be the favored way of doing it.
1) opening /dev/bus/usb and poll'ing on read, then rescanning the
/proc/bus/<busno> directory to find the change. Kinda weird doing file
type things on a directory tho
2) opening /dev/bus/usb/devices and poll'ing on read, then rescanning
the /proc/bus/<busno> directory to find the change
3) opening /dev/bus/usb/devices and use a blocking ioctl
I can't think of anything which is similar enough in the kernel that I
could mimick.
Anyone have any ideas?
