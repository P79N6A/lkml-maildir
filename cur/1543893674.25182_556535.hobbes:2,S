You found the right one.  The ACPI CA in Linux is really the same
as the one from Intel.  Len integrates the Intel one into Linux
periodically.  He uses scripts or something to format it so it looks
more like Linux.
I think Len sometimes takes patches against the "Linux-ized" ACPI CA.
He probably has to apply those by hand to the Intel one, which is
the real "upstream" in this case.  So it might be a bit easier for
him if you generated a diff against the Intel version.  Then it
would show up in Linux, too, in the fullness of time.
In any event, you want to end up with one patch, not two.
You probably would have to add something like:
  #ifndef ARRAY_SIZE
  #define ARRAY_SIZE(x) ...
  #endif
somewhere in the ACPI CA header files.  That way it will work in
non-Linux OSes as well.
