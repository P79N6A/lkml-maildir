Because it is not "readable"? Umm, "*totally wrong*" is a pretty strong
comment to make just because _you_ find something less readable /
maintainable! Anyway, your initial post did give the impression that
you weren't aware of the "default y if ..." mechanism at all, and so
somehow thought the removal of select would cause some graver
problems because somehow the "dependency on XYZ which was
implied by select XYZ" had been lost by the removal of select ... etc.

??? I didn't get this entry, can you give a solid example (you can consider
the case at hand, MOUSE_ATARI and ATARI_KBD_CORE itself). Better
still, if you really think that the above is a better way to solve the
problem at
hand, why don't you submit a patch instead?

What you are suggesting is not practically possible / convenient. See, we
_want_ MOUSE_ATARI to appear in the arch-agnostic area which is along
with the other input devices and hence it is placed in drivers/input/Kconfig.
However, it does depend on arch-specific helper code. This is a real issue,
and we can't simply wish it away.

See, if you really _still_ think this could / should be done some better
way (which is more maintainable, does not cause build failures and
also does not cause those bogus warnings to be printed etc etc),
then please submit a patch instead.

Well, the shortcomings of Kconfig / build scripts that you mentioned are
are somewhat valid indeed, but as I said, unless you or someone submits
patches to clear up the above issues, we do need to solve problems within
that framework itself, isn't it?
