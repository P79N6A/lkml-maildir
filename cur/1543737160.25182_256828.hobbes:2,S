Resize is very rare, whereas the s_groups_count is checked all the
time.  So I really want to use the most lightweight primitives possible
on the read path.  It may even be possible to downgrade the smp_rmb() to
an smp_read_data_depends().
So I don't want to make it atomic if I can avoid it.  It's just an
unsigned long, and I don't know of any cases where a simple read
colliding with a write is going to give the reader a corrupt value.  As
long as I get either the old or new value, everything should be fine
with the read/write barriers as they are.
There are a couple of other values being updated by resize: the reserved
block count, and the s_group_desc index into the group descriptor
buffer_heads.  Unfortunately, the latter simply can't be an atomic_t
(it's a pointer).
So if you really think there's a risk of getting inconsistent reads,
atomic_t isn't going to be enough to fix it.
Cheers,
 Stephen
