David Hinds offered a number of suggestions which included downloading
the beta 3.1.13 pcmcia-cs (pcmcia-cs.09-Mar-00.tar.gz).
With some further research related to my laptop it seems that
my laptop was reporting some wrong information and the 3.1.11
pcmcia utils and the sound system were conflicting.  This conflict
did not happen with 3.1.3 because 3.1.3 wasn't smart enough to do
what it should have.
pcmcia-cs.09-Mar-00.tar.gz utils included a feature that allowed
me to manually override that automatic behavior of pcmcia-cs and
produce a system that worked properly.  Another bug was discovered, and
pcmcia-cs.10-Mar-00.tar.gz quickly came into existence to eliminate it.
All is well now.
Thanks to David Hinds for all his help.
