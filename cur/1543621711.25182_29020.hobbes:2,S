I seem to remember back in either Kernel 2.0 or 2.2 there was a limit of 256
aliases within the ethX aliasing (eg, eth0, then eth0:0 thru eth0:255).
Has the limit on this been expanded with Kernel 2.4, is it stable and/or
advised?  I have a need to bind more than 256 addresses to a single
interface.  Without installing additional network cards.
Thanks,
Jim Roland, RHCE
