Not all card models are tested, yet. It could be possible that 
something is broken. There is a lack of bugreports for ISA cards...
Be aware that the driver for the radio part of the miroSOUND PCM20 
still depends on the OSS aci driver. Someone has to move those files 
drivers/media/radio/miropcm20* to ALSA. Meanwhile I got a miroSOUND 
PCM20 and so I'm still waiting that the ALSA miro driver will be moved 
into the kernel tree for doing it... 
Any plans about moving ALSA miro driver into the kernel? Or is there 
something completely wrong which has to be fixed at first?
