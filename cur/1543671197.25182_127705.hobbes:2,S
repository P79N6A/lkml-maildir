How does the server _know_ that the BIOS is what it says it is? Again,
what's the protocol?  Saying that they 'have a chat' is bypassing
the hard bits.
If I have the BIOS, any secrets it holds are now knowable to me.
This means that any protocol that relies on a secret in the BIOS is
broken from the start.  So now you need to define a protocol which
does not rely on any secret being known to the BIOS.  What is this
protocol?

The proposed 'end-to-end' copy protection schemes for entertainment
media etc, rely on proprietary _hardware_.  This is still beatable,
although at a higher cost.  Nor is the problem quite parallel.  The
broadcast problem is 'how do we keep content encrypted till the
last possible moment?' and 'how do we keep the decryption engine tamper
proof reverse engineering proof'.  The first part is easy.  The second
part is not possible in an absolute sense.  It can only be made more 
or less dificult.  Hence the DMCA etc.

God forbid! ;-)
