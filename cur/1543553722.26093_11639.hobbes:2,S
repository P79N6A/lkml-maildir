Subject: swapout vs. filemap_sync_pte...?

The address_space::writepage callback is called from try_to_swap_out()
path, and also from the filemap_sync_pte() path.  There appears to be no
way to tell the difference between the two callers.  This is not good
because the semantics are very different:  "sync this page" versus "page
is going away".
Should address_space::writepage get passed an additional arg, indicating
the caller?
Should filemap_sync_pte call address_space::sync_page instead of
::writepage?
Either way, this allows the writepage function to know whether it really
needs to store the page, because it is going away, or not.
I will admit I might be missing something obvious...  I'm pretty new to
this part of the code.
