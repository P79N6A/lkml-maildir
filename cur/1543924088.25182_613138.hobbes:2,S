Because it gives a steady feel to things. For humans its most essential
that things run in a predicable fashion. So no only does it matter how
much time a task gets, it also very much matters when it gets that.
It contributes to the feeling of gradual slow down.

Agreed, I've realised this since my last mail, one group should not
influence another in such a fashion, in this respect you don't want to
flatten it like I did.

What made me start tinkering here is that the nested level is again
distributing wall-time without being aware of the fraction it gets from
the upper levels.
So if we have two groups, A and B, and B is selected for 1/2 of period,
then Bn will again divide period, even though in reality it will only
have p/2.
So I guess, I need a top down traversal, not a bottom up traversal to
get this fixed up... I'll ponder this.

Agreed.

Well, its basically giving up on overload, admittedly not very nice.
