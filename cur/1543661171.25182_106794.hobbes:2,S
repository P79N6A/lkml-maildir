Well, could you not do something like:
 +----------------------------+ 4GB
   devices
 +----------------------------+ VMALLOC_END = 0xc2000000
   vmalloc/ioremap
 +----------------------------+ 0xc1000000 + sizeof(linux)
   kernel direct-mapped ram
 +----------------------------+ 0xc1000000
   module
 +----------------------------+ TASK_SIZE = MODULE_START = PAGE_OFFSET =
                                VMALLOC_START = 0xc0000000
   user space
 +----------------------------+
And then arrange for a (start=0xc1000000,len=sizeof(linux)) entry which
describes the kernel itself to be added to the vmlist before anything else?
