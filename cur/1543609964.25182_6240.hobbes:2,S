Sounds sane.  UFS sync mounts also update the inode bitmaps
synchronously, and in order, so that they can tell exactly when an
inode is valid.  I guess that we don't need that, at least on ext2,
since the i_dtime gives us the necessary information automatically.

It's important for people running MTAs which expect dir sync
behaviour: admins have to pay the performance cost of all file updates
being sync as well as the directory updates if they enable chattr +S
on the dir.
