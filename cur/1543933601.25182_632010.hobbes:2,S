Well, you have a number of devices which cannot do runtime pm.
They can do suspend/resume with the whole system. For them these
operations mean saving/restoring state.
So for these devices implementing autosuspend makes no sense.
They would sensibly do only idle/busy detection.

In these cases the devices involved should report themselves busy,
shouldn't they?

We lack a notion of telling devices that they are opened only for
detecting wakeups. Currently a driver has to assume that an opened
device has to be fully functional.
