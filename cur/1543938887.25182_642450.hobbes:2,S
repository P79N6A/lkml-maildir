Subject: [PATCH 4/4] firewire: fw-core: react on bus resets while the config ROM is being fetched
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/23/440

read_rom() obtained a fresh new fw_device.generation for each read
transaction.  Hence it was able to continue reading in the middle of the
ROM even if a bus reset happened.  However the device may have modified
the ROM during the reset.  We would end up with a corrupt fetched ROM
image then.
Although all of this is quite unlikely, it is not impossible.
Therefore we now restart reading the ROM if the bus generation changed.
Side note:  The barrier in read_rom(), inserted by patch "firewire:
enforce access order between generation and node ID" is not necessary
anymore because the sequence of calls
	fw_device_init() ->
		read_bus_info_block() ->
			read_rom()
			read_rom()
			read_rom()
			...
will take care that generation is read before node_id, won't it?
