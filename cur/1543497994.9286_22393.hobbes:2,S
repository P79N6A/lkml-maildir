How about also hot plugging of random ide/scsi drives?  (I can do it if they
are modules).  I know with some devices there are risks.  I have yet to
toast a scsi controller, ide controller, scsi/ide device doing this (and I
have done over 30 hdd's in 1 day on the same pair of controllers)
I dare not hot plug pci/isa or even cpu's into a x86 machine (non laptop). 
From what I understand about solaris and sparcs, if you have a dual or
better sparc, you could take a cpu off line, swap it for a faster and put it
back online w/o rebooting or shutting down.  Now that would be nice for x86
eh?
