It's mostly unmaintained (although the MAINTAINERS file still mentions a
five-year-old entry) and broken; you must be confused with the zr36067
driver, which works perfectly fine, is being (passively) maintained by
me and which has a copy of the relevant files from the kernel sources in
the CVS of mjpegtools.
