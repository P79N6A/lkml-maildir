If he sees the packet it should alert on the local MAC or IP on an 
external packet. As noted you won't get the external packet in all cases.

I like the idea of sending ARP after changing the MAC. I would hope to 
have an option in the switch which prevents MAC takeover by locking the 
MAC to a port as long as the link is up. This doesn't prevent sending a 
packet to another host with the real (evil) MAC and spoofed IP, to set 
the arptable in a single host. In the long run help from the switch is 
probably needed to do it right.
