Again:
Plenty of headers are only exported for some architectures.
In other words, for all architectures where things work.

Now you are really wrong. :-)
The Linux system I saw using this hack was carefully tuned
for hard real-time performance. Latency was a few dozen
microseconds. Disabling the scheduler essentially put you
at the highest SCHED_FIFO; aside from that there was
working priority inheritance for both kernel and user code.
The real-time folk love this kind of thing.
Anyway, it's fine to just not let ARM export the header.

No. The normal interfaces are dreadful.
App developers will just cut-and-paste the i386 kernel
code if you take away the header files. They do that
often enough already. So all you succeed in doing is
eliminating any hope of portability to ppc and similar.
This is not an improvement.
