The /proc interface is registering with &context->ids of init_task.  So,
all other contexts using that interface will be looking at the wrong
info, AFAICT.
As you can tell my concerns are in resource consumption.  If a user can
create contexts which it can hide from sysadmin, and they aren't subject
to sysadmin mandated resource limits, it's effectively a leak, esp. since
these resources don't die with exit(2).
