Hi,
 I would like to use the Real time signalling mechanism. When I try to
use "F_SETAUXFL", compilation fails. While looking through the
archives I found a patch  one-sig-perfd-2.4.4.patch.gz at
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0105.2/0642.html
 which
needs to be applied for the support.
I am using Linux 2.6.16 kernel. So I can't apply this patch directly.
Is there a different patch for this kernel or is the support in built.
If the support is already present, then any pointers on usage(RT
Signalling) would be of great help.
Thanks and Regards,
Sreenath.
