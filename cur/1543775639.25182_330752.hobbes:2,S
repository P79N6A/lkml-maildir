I amafraid this will not help in this particular case - the problem is
with driver-specific memory which is freed way before device disappears.
Consider unloading aiptek module - we need to free aiptek structure when
we unbinding driver but corrsponding USB device will stay there (fully
fucntional with its 'struct device' not going anywhere) until you
physically pull tablet's cord out.
