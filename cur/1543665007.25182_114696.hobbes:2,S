And two more things:
1. every process will already use the prctl(ARCH_SET_FS).  We are
talking here only about the 2nd thread and later.  We need to use
prctl(ARCH_SET_FS) for TLS support.
2. May I remind you that you were in the crowd who complained when we
requested a dedicated thread register?  Yes, I still would prefer that
but I have no energy to battle for that.
