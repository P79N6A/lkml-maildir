As per the toplevel Makefile, target 'modules_install' installs
modules in "$(INSTALL_MOD_PATH)/lib/modules/$(KERNELRELEASE);"
Hence, all you need do is a:
	"make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/var/tmp/somehost"
and tar up that directory...
On another note, if you don't like looking at makefiles, 
isn't this covered in a FAQ/HOWTO somewhere?
