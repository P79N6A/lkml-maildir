I also have a ECS K7S5A, but I have an acer 2010A cd-writer.

My problem was, that the system load was almost unbearable at higher
speeds, but only when I was burning DAO. Do you burn DAO? Is your
system load (top) also very high?
Now I just upgraded to 2.4.20-pre3 and everything is just fine :-) I am
not really sure if it was only the kernel, because I still have the
same problem when I tell the kernel to umask the drive's IRQ (hdparm -u1).
I am not 100% sure if I tried it without umask before.
But without umask, everything seems to work fine now. There's just a
few percent CPU load when doing c2scan or writing DAO.
The only thing is that if I do a c2scan under X, X consumes all my CPU
time after some time and gets unresponsive. Doing the same in the
console there's no problem at all. So I am pretty sure this is a X
problem and not the kernel's.
