There's an Adobe SVG plugin that works on Linux (at least on FC3).

This works fine with a test SVG link at Adobe but after installing it 
Firefox only displays the above link as source :-(
Before I installed the plug in Firefox displayed the above link OK but 
couldn't display the SVG stuff. :-(

Yes, it seems that it needs some work.
