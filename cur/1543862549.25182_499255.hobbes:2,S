Subject: [PATCH] adjust use of unplug in elevator code

Hi Chris, Jens,
Can you look at this, and push upstream if this looks reasonable
to you? It fixes a bug I've been tripping over.
--linas
A flag was recently added to the elevator code to avoid
performing an unplug when reuests are being re-queued.
The goal of this flag was to avoid a deep recursion that
can occur when re-queueing requests after a SCSI device/host 
reset.  See 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/17/254
However, that fix added the flag near the bottom of a case
statement, where an earlier break (in an if statement) could
transport one out of the case, without setting the flag.
This patch sets the flag earlier in the case statement.
I re-discovered the deep recursion recently during testing;
I was told that it was a known problem, and the fix to it was
in the kernel I was testing. Indeed it was ... but it didn't
fix the bug. With the patch below, I no longer see the bug.
