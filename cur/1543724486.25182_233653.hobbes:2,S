FWIW, I have been using Nigel's swsusp2 for a long time now on a 2.4
kernel. It has been exceptionally well-behaved and stable. And it's an
extremely important part of my Linux world. I will not move to 2.6
unless I'm sure swsusp2 will work well.
In fact, it seems to me that many kernel developers underestimate the
importance of software suspend to actual real Linux users. I guess when
you reboot your monster PC rig five times a day to upgrade kernels, you
don't much care. But if you use a laptop and you actually care about
opening it and getting a stable, working environment within 20s, trust
me -- software suspend becomes more important to you than all the
scheduler improvements in the world.
I would gladly trade all the performance improvements of the last couple
of years for a stable, working swsusp2 and a USB subsystem which doesn't
a) prohibit my CPU from using C3 sleep and b) crash and burn regularly
bringing the whole machine down with it.
