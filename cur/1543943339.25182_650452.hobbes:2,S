I forgot to mention this earlier, but RHEL/Fedora/Rawhide has a patched 
version of SSH (see RH bugzilla #202856 for the discussion/patch) that 
fixes the problem of IPv4 options causing SSH to reject the connection.  
It turns out that SSH is being a bit overzealous (rejecting all IPv4 
options) in trying to reject source-routed packets.
