umm, OK, if you say so.  I'm not sure I understand the point behind
all this, but I'm sure there is one ;)

Lots of git goodies there - I didn't actually receive the patch: the parts
which move files around were communicated via git metadata, not diffs.
Presumably there's a way to tell git to not do that.
But probably it's best that this change be merged via git anyway.  David,
are you interested in handling it?
