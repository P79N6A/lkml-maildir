Looks sane to me.
+ * syscalls.h - Linux syscall interfaces (non-arch-specific)
...
+#include <linux/aio_abi.h>
+#include <linux/sched.h>
+#include <linux/socket.h>
+#include <linux/sysctl.h>
+#include <linux/time.h>
+#include <linux/posix-timers.h>
+#include <linux/uio.h>
+
+#include <asm/signal.h>
+#include <asm/stat.h>
I'd be inclined to lose the includes and just add forward decls for
structs.  Of course, you'll need the includes for typedefs.  
+extern asmlinkage long sys_unlink(const char __user *pathname);
+extern asmlinkage long sys_chmod(const char __user *filename, mode_t mode);
+extern asmlinkage long sys_fchmod(unsigned int fd, mode_t mode);
Maybe lose the `extern' too.  It's just a waste of space.  I normally put
it in for consistency if the surrounding code is done that way, but for a
new header file, why bother?
