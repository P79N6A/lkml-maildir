     - use fast pte quicklists on non-pae machines           (Andrea Arcangeli)
Does this work on SMP?  I remember they were turned off because
they were simply broken on SMP.
The problem is that when vmalloc() or whatever kernel mappings change
you have to update all the quicklist page tables to match.
Andrea probably fixed this, I haven't looked at the patch.
If so, ignoreme.
