Well, pci_* is a legacy API in Linux 2.5 now.  Currently architectures
can either implement dma_* or pci_* and the other one will be emulated,
but I hope we can get rid of this mess soon and dma_* is the one
implemented on the architectures and pci_* emulated in a single
place - and maybe it can go away two stables series from now.
