Subject: 2.2.19 and ide.2.2.19.04092001.patch error
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/4/27/142

While trying to use this patch to access /dev/hde1 on my Promise controller, 
I get  the following errors:
dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=21233782, sector=21233712
This fs has errors on it, and trying to run fsck on it I get:
Error reading block 2654557 (Attempt to read block from filesystem resuleted 
in short read) while doing inode scan. Ignore error<y>?
I use the following in my /etc/lilo.conf:
ide[0-2]=autotune
This is 2.2.19 with the IDE patch, and the EXT3 patch (though this drive is 
still ext2).
Kernel config is attached. So is a description of my computer. Anyone got any 
ideas?

Ambivalent? Well, yes and no.
