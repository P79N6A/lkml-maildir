Subject: [PATCH, V2] i386: instead of poisoning .init zone, change protection bits to force a fault
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Chasing some invalid accesses to .init zone, I found that free_init_pages() 
was properly freeing the pages but virtual was still usable.
A poisoning (memset(page, 0xcc, PAGE_SIZE)) was done but this is not reliable.
A new config option DEBUG_INITDATA is introduced to mark this initdata as not 
present at all so that buggy code can trigger a fault.
This option is not meant for production machines because it may split one or 
two huge page (2MB or 4MB) into small pages and thus slow down kernel a bit.
(After that we could map non possible cpu percpu data to the initial 
percpudata that is included in .init and discarded in free_initmem())
