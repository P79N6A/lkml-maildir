Don't get me started on OOM killer.  If the OOM killer is killing hotplug
scripts, there's another problem.  What's the chance of hotplug scripts
being the memory hog? :)
That said, I understand what you're saying.  It's rough.

IFF the app is designed to handle it.  The existence of a SIGPWR handler
does not necessarily imply that, though.  a SIGCPU or something might
correlate 1:1 with this, but SIGPWR doesn't.
Solving it from hotplug scripts means the task's affinity is not
automatically violated.  It means the decision to violate the affinity was
made in user-space, probably by the admin, who CAN know what the affinity
means.

I remembered that after I sent it, sorry. :)
