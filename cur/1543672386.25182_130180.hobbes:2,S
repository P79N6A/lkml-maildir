Okay, didn't think of that, so I now tried using ide-cd for the MO drive
(2.5.68+bkcvs). I still had to patch ide-probe.c, just passing "hde=cdrom" 
did not do what I wanted. ;)
Now I get the following at bootup:
hde: FUJITSU MCC3064AP, ATAPI OPTICAL drive
hde: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04

This doesn't look encouraging. However, the MO drive sort of works:
# mount -t ext2 /dev/hde /mnt/mo
mount: block device /dev/hde is write-protected, mounting read-only
The disk gets mounted and reading works just fine. No write support,
though. To reiterate, everything works under 2.4 using ide-scsi.
What can I do to help get this drive supported under 2.5/ide-cd?
I'll check if reading from the MO drive works with ide-cd under 2.4
as well. If it does: what about a patch that makes ATAPI MO drives
and CD writers behave the same on 2.4: read-only with native ide drivers,
read-write with ide-scsi?
