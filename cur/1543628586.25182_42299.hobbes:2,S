  No thread and timer associated with it.
  I am a kernel newbie. I just managed to make the module's release function to cope with "ctrl+c", nothing more is done. I do not know how to impove my code to make it cope with the TERM signal(No. 15 signal ?). In closing the dev file of a device, IMHO, all signal trigger the same function.
