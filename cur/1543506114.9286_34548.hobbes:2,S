 	Just to add to the amount of gathered data about mouse problems:
 	I have a Logitech Mouseman+ Wheel.  This is the FOUR button one
 	with the button on the side and the middle button is also a
 	wheel.  RedHat 6.0 sets it as "pnp" for the type with GPM,
 	however my /var/log/messages file gets gpm errors printed in it
 	all day long.  Some times it says "message repeated 238 times"
 	and stuff like that.
 	The mouse WORKS fine.  No noticeable problems, but the errors in
 	the log make the log grow fast.  Note that there are bootleg
 	mice like this, and I know mine is NOT a bootleg.  It is an
 	official Logitech mouse (just so nobody tells me my mouse is
 	broken and a clone bootleg).
 	If anyone thinks that this might also be related to the problems
 	with mice, I would be glad to send syslog chunks, and any other
 	debugging info I can to aide in this matter. Re: bezerk keyboard/mouse

there is definately some buffer getting corrupted with the bezerko
mouse.  However do make sure that you are NOT running gpm while running
X.

    do a gpm -k if you are in X and getting these messages.   I wrote a
script and posted it to one of these lists that checked if gpm was
running and then stopped it before starting X, but not sure which X
startup script this should have gone into...
something like
if [ps -aux|grep gpm |grep -v grep] then
    gpm -k
fi
    If your mouse is working fine, I would not worry. the best thing to
do is see some of my other posting to this list about the mouse bug.  it
is well described
    Also try 2.2.11 as there were many keyboard, serial, and irq fixes.
    Incidentally I have switched to a ps/2 mouse and 2.2.11 and have not
had the problem since.
