Hello
While making enhancements to the 3com driver(vortex) I stumbled upon a grey
stone regarding the ioctl calls. can there be more than 16 ioctl calls for
the device ? The question arose from the fact that whenever a new ioctl
command is issued the kernel by default returns one of the Private ioctl
command. Hence would like to know more regarding these.
Please CC me the answer personnally.
Thanks & Regards
Sujit Menon
