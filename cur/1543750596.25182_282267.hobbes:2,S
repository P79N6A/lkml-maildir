RESOLVED.
I enabled support for hotplug devices and installed an initrd; then it works.
They tell me there's a way to make it work without initrd, but it's ugly, messy, and not recommended:
http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/udev/
I haven't yet tested to see if it works with initrd and without support for hotplug devices, but from the documentation I've read my money is on no.
