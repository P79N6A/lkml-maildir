I just wonder - what is the problem with this convoy formation?
It can only happen when the cpu is overloaded, and in that case
someone has to wait.  In this case, the mutex waiters. 
Aggressively handing the cpu to whoever holds a mutex will mean the
mutexes are free more of the time - but it will *not* mean less waiting in
tghe system.  You just changes who waits.
