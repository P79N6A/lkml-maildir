Thanks, Dave.  This driver is interested in property existence and
length-- some OBP versions don't create all expected envctrl
properties, and due to lack of implementation documentation the
property lengths are being checked as well; so of_find_property()
seems appropriate in this case.
Would you consider assigning -1 to lenp (if provided) in
of_find_property() when no matching device is found?
Thanks,
