No, I don't think there are even "moved to RCU" users. It's just never 
been used very much, since the writes are _so_ expensive (in fact, there 
have been various live-locks on the writer side, the whole brlock thing is 
really questionable).
It's entirely possible that the current user could be replaced by RCU 
and/or seqlocks, and we could get rid of brlocks entirely.
