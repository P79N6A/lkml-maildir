you don't say the kernel, X, or hardware, but I've seen that personally
with radeon 7500... that what you have?

seems to be ich4 audio - you need 0.23/24 driver for this to work -
check with the AC series - OR -
with my _particular_ i845E chipset - commenting out the "break;" immediately
after the line that goes "Primary codec not ready" makes this work fine --
probably your computer will burst into flames if you do the same or
something... this is *NOT* a recommendation.
