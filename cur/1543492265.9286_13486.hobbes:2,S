Subject: udp port unreachable - what behavior ?

/*
  Hi kernel hackers.
  The following program shows a strange behavior
  of the udp handling of the kernel.
  In the source, it is said that to an udp packet
  sent to an unreachable port, it SHOULD be returned
  and icmp packet (don't remember what) as stated by rfc XXX (don't remember).
  But, on my system, this program sometimes runs 5 turns (on 2.2.1) sometimes
  less, sometimes even 0 (ie no ICMP reply). Try it very quickly.
  So my question is, what does this "SHOULD" mean ? It is not "always", it
  is not "never", but it doesn't seem to be "at least one".
  In fact, all this comes from the libc with the resolver. I had a bad
  configuration with /etc/host.conf, and it did a connect to port domain
  of localhost where no named runs (i don't need one). So i changed
  /etc/host.conf to point to an non-existing host so now i don't have
  unreachable port but unreachable host or something like that, and it
  does reply (well, in fact it doesn't block anymore, don't really know what's
  going on).
  So is it the kernel that is wrong or me ?
  Sed, not on the list, a CC is welcome.
