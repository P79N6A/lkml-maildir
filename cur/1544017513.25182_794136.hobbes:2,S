I recd. this error while trying to resize  root partition thru lvm
using the system-config-lvm utility :
umount command failed. Command attempted: "/bin/umount /" - System
Error Message: umount: /: device is busy
umount: /: device is busy
However using command line it works absolutely fine.
Why does this happen ?
