urgh.  zone->free_pages is very small - probably zero.  We shouldn't have
got here at all, so something else is wrong.
But local `free_pages' can go negative in normal operation.  I guess
that'll cause us to incorrectly return `true' from zone_watermark_ok, thus
ignoring the watermarks.
The below, I guess.  But we still don't know why this got called against an
empty zone.
