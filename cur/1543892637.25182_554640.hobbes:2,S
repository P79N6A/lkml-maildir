Disagree Adrian
For quoted strings you want to include Unicode where appropriate, and the
names of people happens to be highly appropriate. Trashing non US names
is just rude, and in many cases extremely problematic because losing
accent marks totally changes the meaning of the word and the
pronunciation of the name.
Now anyone who puts UTF-8 in the driver name or module options should get
a lot of NAKs but putting it in the Author name is precisely where it is
appropriate and correct. I suspect Author names are almost the only case
where this is appropriate and/or neccessary.
