Just to be clear: you think there should be cases where pspace x can
kill processes in pspace y, but can't enter it?
I'm not convinced that grounded in reasonable assumptions...

What sort of interfaces do you envision for these two?  If we
can lay them out well enough, maybe the result will satisfy the
openvz folks?
For instance, perhaps we just use a proc interface, where in the
current pspace, if we've created a new pspace which in our pspace
is known as process 567, then we might see
/proc
/proc/567
/proc/567/pspace
/proc/567/pspace/1 -> link to /proc/567
/proc/567/pspace/2
Now we also might be able to interact with the pspace by doing
something like
	echo -9 > /proc/567/pspace/2/kill
and of course do things like
	cd /proc/567/pspace/1/root

And where are we talking about?  Is this an identifier for userspace
tools?  Or just in kernelspace?
