Hallo,
It's Petkan again. I finaly patched string-486.h in order
to work. My 2.2.12 and 2.3.18 kernels are working with it
without crash until now. The only known problem is when i
tried  to compile sound drivers with 486 string routines.
It appears to be some macro error, but i haven't time to debug
so i just switch off the sound modules from the config.
I had to coment three routines: strtok, strpbrk and strstr.
They're moved from arch dependent file (.../asm-i386/string.h)
and are used C routines placed in linux/lib/string.c.
Please, test this.
TIA,
Petkan
