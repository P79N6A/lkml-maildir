You want stuff like critical shutdowns to work even if userspace is
dead.
I do not think you can control passive cooling adequately from
userspace, and you can certainly not prevent kernel from slowing
machine down too soon.
Plus, this is actually nasty user-visible change, and a regression
from 2.6.21. I am not sure why we are even debating this; user-kernel
interface changed without warning. Patch should be simply reverted.
