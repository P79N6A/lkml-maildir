Yeah, this is where my Athlon64x2 goes into the weeds.  I followed it
down into the routines that calculate processor migration costs and
got lost in the context switches.  I suspect that the forced
migrations aggravate a problem down in the 64-bit arch specific code
that hasn't been looked at in a while (I believe most people running
AMD are doing so in 32-bit mode).
Maybe it's time for round two...
