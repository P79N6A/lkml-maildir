That would be 100% pure overhead. The nfsi->commit list does not need to
be sorted and with these patches applied, it no longer is. In fact one
of the cleanups I still need to do is to get rid of those redundant
checks on wb->index (start is now always set to 0, and end is always
~0UL).
So the overhead you are currently seeing should just be that of
iterating through the list, locking said requests and adding them to our
private list.
Cheers,
