Does the fcntl() one originate from anywhere other than find_pid() in
f_setown()?  It seems like, perhaps, the error checking is being done at
the wrong level.

OK, I think it is makes sense to me to say 'get_pid(tsk, pidspace)' and
get back a NULL 'struct pid' if that task isn't visible in that
namespace.  However, I don't get how it is handy to be able to defer the
fact that the pid wasn't found until you go do a pid_nr() on that NULL.
