Yes agreed.  What we need to do is to give the compiler enough information
to know that the sysctl table is not used.
Making the function an inline and having the table marked "static"
should be enough for the compiler to do the optimization for us instead
of having to manually remove sysctl tables by hand.
Doing it with an inline function should save us a lot of work and maintenance
in the long run.   I will see if I can cook up that patch.

Agreed.
