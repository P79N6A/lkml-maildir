That's a very poor filter, I don't write much code lately in the
networking.
I only provide theoretical direction in a few specific areas I care
about.
As Ingo already knows, I think this "put everything on lkml" argument
is bogus.
And about bisectability, every time I apply a networking patch I do at
the very least a "allmodconfig" build with just that new patch added,
for every patch.  Often I do more extensive build testing.
And when I rebase the tree, I rerun this check after each
patch gets re-applied to a new base tree.
In fact I'm working on such issues as I fly over the Australia
for LCA08 :-)
So this isn't an issue that posting to lkml is going to help.
