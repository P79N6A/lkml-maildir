> I've tested out various things (see below for a summary), and 
Thanks for testing out the code.  I had meant to mention that there is a
test program for waitid in the glibc test suite, which is what I used to
test the code before submitting it.  It's in posix/tst-waitid.c in the
glibc CVS sources.  You can tweak that program slightly to build it
independent of glibc.  For anyone who wants to try it out using glibc, I'll
attach below the patches that enable use of the system call (if you build
glibc against kernel headers including the waitid patch).

This is something I did consider in detail, though I overlooked commenting
on it.  The POSIX wording on this is not entirely unambiguous.  What it
does say is, "If waitid() returns because a child process was found [...],
then the structure pointed to by infop shall be filled in by the system
[...]"  It does not say that *infop is written in any other case.  So, I
think a POSIX-compliant application must not assume that it will be.  
Given that specification, I made the system call do just what it says and
no more.  For a WNOHANG return without a child, it doesn't touch the structure.
The tst-waitid program intends to be POSIX-compliant (in its use of
waitid), and so I wrote it to zero the si_signo field before the call and
check whether it got set to SIGCHLD or not.  The POSIX specification for
waitid specifically requires that si_signo be set to SIGCHLD when the
siginfo_t is filled in.  Taking the standard as a whole, you can also
conclude that it requires that si_pid be filled in and not zero.  So that
is also a reasonable test--if you zeroed the structure (or at least the
field you want to test) before the waitid call.
I think one could even construe the POSIX wording to mean that a WNOHANG
return-without-child should not touch the structure at all.  However, I
would not argue for that and say Solaris should not zero si_pid here.
Thanks,
Roland
glibc patch follows:
2004-08-04  Roland McGrath  <roland@redhat.com>
	* sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/waitflags.h
	(WSTOPPED, WEXITED, WCONTINUED, WNOWAIT): New macros.
	* sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/waitid.c: New file.  Use new syscall when
	available, or fall back to the waitpid-based generic code.
