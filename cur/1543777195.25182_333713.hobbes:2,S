I had also faced this problem and I had simply used Alt-Sysrq-c to force
kexec on panic. As mentioned in the report below the problem goes away
if mpt driver is compiled with MPT_DEBUG_IRQ support. 
In kdump environment, device might not be in a reset state while driver is
initializing in second kernel. Hence we probably need two things from the 
driver to be able to successfully initialize over kdump.
- Reset the underlying device before enabling the interrupts.
- In interrupt handler, make sure the interrupt belongs to the driver 
  before processing it further.  (Shared interrupt lines)
