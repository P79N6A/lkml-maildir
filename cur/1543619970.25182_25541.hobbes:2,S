Can you play with it a bit more?
Go to that file, uncomment it back, fiddle with
pci_fixup_via_northbridge_bug(): try to clear only bit 7,
then only 7 and 6 and see which cause it...
Make it print reg#, old, new contents:
...
printk("Trying to stomp on VIA Northbridge bug: [%02x] %02x->%02x\n", where, v, v & 0x1f);
...
etc.
Original function for your reference:
static void __init pci_fixup_via_northbridge_bug(struct pci_dev *d)
{
        u8 v;
        int where = 0x55;
        if (d->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8367_0) {
                where = 0x95; /* the memory write queue timer register is
                                 different for the kt266x's: 0x95 not 0x55 */
        }
        pci_read_config_byte(d, where, &v);
        if (v & 0xe0) {
                printk("Trying to stomp on VIA Northbridge bug...\n");
                v &= 0x1f; /* clear bits 5, 6, 7 */
                pci_write_config_byte(d, where, v);
        }
}
