I think the problem is probably all those "printk()" calls
within timing-sensitive code (really). A Bus master arbitration
failure is supposed to result in a retry. It is not supposed to
be fatal. For kicks, just comment out the printk() and see if
the box starts to work. If that makes it work, an appropriate
permanent fix would be to just keep track of the number of
such failures just like the dropped-packet and collision count.
If removing the printk() doesn't fix it, there may be a retained
spin-lock on an error exit path.
