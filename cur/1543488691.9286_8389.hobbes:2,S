Subject: Strange Network/X lockups under 2.2.2-ac7

Ok, after getting 2.2.2-ac7 installed, I had hoped that it would solve my
random, complete lockups when using an Xserver on my Windows box and
launching Xterms on my linux box. But it hasn't.
I still can't MAKE it happen, but about once every 12 hours, my box will
lockup solid.
Now, at least, SysRQ works (even though Unmounting filesystems doesn't
work).
Does anyone have a suggestion on how to go about debugging this? It makes
my homenet unusable for all practical purposes. Mayhaps some information I
can pick up via a SysRQ key or somesuch? Be explicit please.
I'm willing to do almost anything to get this to work. In fact, my next
step is to completely remove the / filesystem and install RedHat 5.2 to
see if that fixes things.
Thank you!
*** I want to make sure everyone understands that I _AM NOT_ running an X
server on the box. Just doing a 
xterm -display winbox:0.0
In fact, all I have installed are the Xlibs and a few choice xapps
(xfontsel, xterm, etc.).
G'day!
