None of this matters :)
The kernel standard is 'static inline', so that is the preferred
usage in standard kernel code, without overriding reasons.
(also note that it is an outstanding cleanup item to replace
 'extern [__]inline[__]' with 'static inline', unless there are
 overriding reasons not to do so.)
