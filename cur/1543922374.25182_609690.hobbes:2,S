The driver is one of the grotty drivers people are afraid to touch, 
therefore it bitrots even faster, in a vicious cycle.  You don't have to 
look hard at all to find checkpatch pukeage, very real bugs, and 
Pythonesque silliness.
Not having hardware I went only for changes that are provable and 
obvious, really...
