Hi
I'm not able to rip audio-cds under any recent 2.3-kernel.
This happens both when I use a cd-ripper program and when i try to dd
directly from /dev/hdc (my IDE cdrom drive). The error message i
recieve is: "Unable to open /dev/hdc: Wrong medium type"
I am sorry if this is a known error (or if I'm doing something
obviously wrong  :), but it seems to me that this is an error that
should be fixed.
Normal playing of audio-cd's work perfectly, but as this is done
mainly (fully?) in hardware, it would probably be quite hard to
break...
