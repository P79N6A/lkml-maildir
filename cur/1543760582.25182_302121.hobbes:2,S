First: I didn't write the patch, only forwarded it, so I just guessed why it 
was done.
The latter is spin_lock_init(&lock); (since someone got confused about this).
However, this is a .lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED  -> 
spin_lock_init(&struct.lock),
so I don't understand what changes... the structure is initialized inside a 
function, so there's no change.

I don't see the need here... and the initialization is not in static code; it 
changes this code snippet:
void *port_data(int port_num)
{
//...
        *port = ((struct port_list)
                { .list                 = LIST_HEAD_INIT(port->list),
                  .has_connection       = 0,
                  .sem                  = __SEMAPHORE_INITIALIZER(port->sem,
                                                                  0),
                  .lock                 = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED,
                  .port                 = port_num,
                  .fd                   = fd,
                  .pending              = LIST_HEAD_INIT(port->pending),
                  .connections          = 
LIST_HEAD_INIT(port->connections) });
So you are all doing some confusion (in fact I guess Andrew realized this when 
he merged this anyway).
