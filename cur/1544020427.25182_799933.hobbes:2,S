Subject: [PATCH 0/2] TPM: refactoring and integrity

This patchset contains a refactoring patch and integrity one. The first addresses Matt Helsley and Dave Hansen's comments on replacing the data[] vectors by packed structures making the code easier to read and debug and also consolidates most of the tpm_show_* functions. The second one provides an interface to read and extend PCR values, which is widely used by IMA.
This version also addresses Matt Helsley's last observation on the timeout_t structure usage to access TPM_CAP_PROP_TIS_DURATION capability, now a new structure is being used, duration_t, whose fields now match exactly as defined in the TPM specification.
