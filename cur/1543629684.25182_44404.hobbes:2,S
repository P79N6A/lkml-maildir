Yep, that is a good summary.  And the problem arises from the very large
penalty for the syncronization form used for CPU v I/O ordering.  You
only want to pay that when necessary, certainly not when only CPU v CPU
ordering is required.  The difference can be on the order of a 1000
cycles (depending on many factors, of course).
