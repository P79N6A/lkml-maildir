Maybe this is a nitpick, but consider what happens with timeout=MAXLONG
(actually 1000/HZ-1 values up to MAXLONG).  The macro is
#define ROUND_UP(x,y) (((x)+(y)-1)/(y))
so for timeout==MAXLONG, HZ==100, the numerator evaluates as MAXLONG+9,
which is negative.
This is a problem with other occurences of the ROUND_UP macro too.
The easy fix is to cast to unsigned long
	timeout = ROUND_UP((unsigned long)timeout, 1000/HZ);
