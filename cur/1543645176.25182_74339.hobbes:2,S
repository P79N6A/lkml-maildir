But can there be more candidates for one route, in which case one would 
run something similar to this algorithm then?
Or would you have an already-sorted list of possible candidate addresses 
for each route in the order of preference?  And recalculate always when 
address changes?
Or..?

This is IMO a wrong approach from user's perspective.  Perhaps not if the 
algorithm was run and e.g. additional, temporary "address selection" 
routes were created by kernel.

Hmm.. this depends on the interpretation of the concept above.  If the
list is refreshed always when addresses change or change state, this could
perhaps work..
