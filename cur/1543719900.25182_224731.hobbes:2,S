It's not just the matter of dropping one kernel parameter.  The procfs
support, _already  implemented_, allows  one to fine-tune  the binding
between serio  ports and  devices, which is  a new and  useful feature
that  your kernel  parameter  doesn't provide.   
Can you unbind the keyboard port?   Can you bind/unbind any of the AUX
ports  *dynamically*  without   reloading  the  i8042  module?   These
functionalities are  already there in the serio-related  code.  Just a
userland interface is missing.  My patch is to fill this gap.

sysfs  looks  good  for  simple parameters:  integers,  strings.   For
anything more  complicated (sets, graphs),  I don't see it  fit (yet).
Unfortunately, the serio port<-->device relation is already a graph (1
to n).
I'd like  to see  how you implement  the device<-->handler  binding in
input.c using sysfs.  It'd be a nice feature.  Imagine how annoying it
is for 'evbug' to report your keypresses, when you're just debugging a
mouse driver.   Being able to adjust the  device<-->handler binding is
what I  want.  I don't  care whether it's  a procfs approach  or sysfs
approach, as long as it is  reasonably useable.  (You could even do it
with ioctl(), if you provide a  nice command line tool so that I don't
need  to care about  the ioctl  parameters.)  I'm  not going  to touch
input.c,  because  I  don't  want   to  reboot  everytime  to  test  a
modification.  It's hard to compile input.c as a module.
