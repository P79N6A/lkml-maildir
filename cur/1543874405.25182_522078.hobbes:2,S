Not to mention that it seems to only be tested thus far
by a very vocal and supportive core.  It needs much wider
exposure for much longer before risking it in mainline.
It likely will get there, eventually, just not yet.
I've droppped it from my machine -- interactive response is much
more important for my primary machine right now.
I believe Ingo's much simpler hack produces as good/bad results
as this RSDL thingie, and with one important extra:
it can be switched on/off at runtime.

Subject: [patch] CFS scheduler: Completely Fair Scheduler
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
add the CONFIG_SCHED_FAIR option (default: off): this turns the Linux 
scheduler into a completely fair scheduler for SCHED_OTHER tasks: with 
perfect roundrobin scheduling, fair distribution of timeslices combined 
with no interactivity boosting and no heuristics.
a /proc/sys/kernel/sched_fair option is also available to turn
this behavior on/off.
if this option establishes itself amongst leading distributions then we
could in the future remove the interactivity estimator altogether.
