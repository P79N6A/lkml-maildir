Subject: __pa(vmalloc()) considered harmful?

It sure doesn't make sense to me, but that's effectively what 
elf_kcore_store_hdr does:
	for (m=vmlist; m; m=m->next) {
		[ snip ]
		phdr->p_paddr	= __pa(m->addr);
		[ snip ]
	}
This doesn't actually hurt when __pa(addr) == addr - $SOMETHING, but it
does produce meaningless numbers.
It does hurt when your __pa() is something more complicated and it can
tell that it's being asked to do something stupid.
So what's p_paddr supposed to be, anyway?
