I've been having a problem with memory since 2.4.0test9...for some reason,
shortly after my system boots, my hard drive begins to seek rapidly for no
apparent reason, and suddenly about 150MB of my 256MB RAM is filled up with
something gtop labels 'Other.'  whatever's filling my memory isn't attached
to any process.   the one time I managed to get gtop open while the hard
drive was seeking, I noticed that kflushd was using about 98% of my
processor (an Athlon 900MHz).  I'm running Redhat 7.0 (although I have no
idea whether that makes a difference).
regards,
j.d.
