This is solved by many other projects by asking the submitter to open a 
bug for the issue when he sends it in an email.
The submitter then simply copies the information from his email to his 
newly opened bug in the bug tracker.
-> no problem

I said a web interface is not worse than via email.
And it's enough.
(And I e.g. wouldn't oppose using the Debian bug tracker where the web 
 interface only allows reading and everything has to be done via email
 if all kernel maintainers would agree to use this.)

After all discussions about crazy bug tracker features we are back at 
the real problem:
Where do we find the tree these people grow on?

We will never get 100% of all bugs fixed.
Let's get back to the fact that we have many bug reports that could be 
fixed within a reasonable amount of time but are not.
