There it is ;-). However I still didn't extend the semantics
of the struct blk_dev_size blk_dev[] array into a conglomerate of
per device not just per major object, becouse basically:
1. The speed optimizations I have applyed to ll_rw_blk.c are
interresting
for theyr own sake. All the setup done in blk_dev_init where blk_dev
just get's
initialized in one run will later be moved to some kind of per device
allocation
function. They help to reduce the number of direct refferences of
blk_dev there too...
(BTW. Just compare the size of ll_rw_blk.o befor and after and you will
basically
scream about the exhaustive switches on hardcoded major numbers found
there....)
2. I Have to think over about what exactly to do with the similiar
static arrays
blkdevs and chrdevs in fs/devices.c. (Fortunately all the lookup done on
this
isn't in any place timinig crucial.
3. I wonted to give this patch out, since it's entierly clean in itself,
so can be easly
tested. (Or even permanently applyed.)
4. I still need time to dig a bit deeper into the loop and raid driver
*mess*.
BTW. Surprisingly the transition for 2.3.29 to 2.3.30 went entierly
smooth for me...
