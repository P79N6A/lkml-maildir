And it turns out it was spot on.
Applying  4g-2.6.0-test2-mm2-A5.patch (on top of preceding -mm1
patches) causes my server not to boot.
I tried all the broken out patches except
     4g-2.6.0-test2-mm2-A5.patch
     4g4g-locked-userspace-copy.patch
but then it couldn't find /sbin/init, even though the root filesystem
was successful found (I don't know if that is significant).
With all of mm1 applied, and with X86_4G selected, it boots fine.
But without X86_4G it doesn't get to print out any messages at all,
even with 'earlyprintk=vga' set.
I am happy to experiment with if you or anyone has patches you would
like tested.
