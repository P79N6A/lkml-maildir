[PATCH] fs: struct file move from call_rcu() to SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU
Currently we schedule RCU frees for each file we free separately. That has
several drawbacks against the earlier file handling (in 2.6.5 f.e.), which
did not require RCU callbacks:
1. Excessive number of RCU callbacks can be generated causing long RCU
  queues that in turn cause long latencies. We hit SLUB page allocation
  more often than necessary.
2. The cache hot object is not preserved between free and realloc. A close
  followed by another open is very fast with the RCUless approach because
  the last freed object is returned by the slab allocator that is
  still cache hot. RCU free means that the object is not immediately
  available again. The new object is cache cold and therefore open/close
  performance tests show a significant degradation with the RCU
  implementation.
One solution to this problem is to move the RCU freeing into the Slab
allocator by specifying SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU as an option at slab creation
time. The slab allocator will do RCU frees only when it is necessary
to dispose of slabs of objects (rare). So with that approach we can cut
out the RCU overhead significantly.
However, the slab allocator may return the object for another use even
before the RCU period has expired under SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU. This means
there is the (unlikely) possibility that the object is going to be
switched under us in sections protected by rcu_read_lock() and
rcu_read_unlock(). So we need to verify that we have acquired the correct
object after establishing a stable object reference (incrementing the
refcounter does that).
