BTW, I got your other e-mail with the patch. I'll see if I can try the
patch sometime in the next few hours.

100% reproducible for me:
---begin quote---
Shutdown: hda
Power down.
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
---end quote---

Earlier in boot it says "apm: bios not found" or something like that. I
can try again without ACPI or APM compiled into the kernel at all and
see what happens. (IIRC, on all of my systems with working APM, the patch
doesn't introduce any problems -- shutdown just works.)

Yeah, I need to give that a try, but it's possible that I won't be able
to do that for a couple of days.

For me, it's absolute 100% correlation over 20-30 test runs or so
(unfortunately it didn't occur to me to keep an exact count).

Yes, I should have time to test patches.
