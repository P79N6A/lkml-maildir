What are you talking about?  Neither O_LARGEFILE nor open64 is in POSIX.
 But both are in the LFS extensions.
This whole change seems dubious at best.  Who has argued that
O_LARGEFILE mustn't be returned?  I do not agree at all.  If the test
suite checks this the author must defend the position.
I suggest to not make any changes.  It is perfectly OK to define new O_
flags and the open() specification does not require that none of them
must set implicitly.
