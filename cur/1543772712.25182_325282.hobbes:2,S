The problem with the patch at this time is that many of the headers,
including the one you mention, need clean up as well as some
reorganization. The problem with general sloppiness of the patch from
rapid patch inclusion is different than the big event of integrating
the patch into the mainline. Also, folks like me and you in our
respective companies are much more aggressive about doing things with
the patch which is the exception of Linux kernel users and not the
norm. A little more testing wouldn't hurt as well, but I think the
patch is certainly worth getting into an semi-experimental kernel.
IMO, the patch should go eventually, but after some significant clean
up. There will be other areas in the kernel that will force some
more proper abstraction and compartmentalization.
That's my view on the matter.
