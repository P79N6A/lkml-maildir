To your Good Attention
My name is Mr. Idris A.Alameyah. I was a director in ministry of
Land and Natural Resources in the Western Saharan Republic. 
My country is of about 10 million people,very happy and rich but
developing. I have an offer to make to you which will benefit both
of us.
Through the award of contracts to three German Companies in three
years, I was able to make US$55 million. Due to the small size of my
country, if this fund is injected into the economy, it will instantly
attract suspicion so I decided to use a foreigner to secure it out of
Western Sahara. I have properly rendered and closed the accounts for
the three years last December of 2001 and so the US$55 Million is
safely 
mine now.
The money is secured in two separate ways of US$25m and US$30m. Due
to our poor banking system here I want you to assist me to secure the
funds for me in
Europe. You will have to travel to the European nation, which I will
later tell you and secure the funds for me. For this assistance, I
will give you US$10million. The rest will be mine and you will also
help me in investing it in real estates and other
profitable businesses. This transaction is planned to be concluded
quickly. I will give you the necessary documentations to claim
ownership of the money on my
behalf. The documentations will officially legalize the transaction
in your name so that it will be completely safe for both of us.
I am also aware of the attention large movement of funds attract
now
since the September 11th 2001 attack on New York, so I will provide
you with Clearance Certificate.
Once again, I assure you it is going to be a risk free transaction. 
Once 
I get your response, I will give you further information/details
of how we are going to
quickly and safely conclude the transaction and start investments.
I await your response through my above e-mail address.
Best regards,
Mr.Idris A.Alameyah
