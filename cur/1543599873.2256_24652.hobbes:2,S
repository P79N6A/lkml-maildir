There was a kernel patch (or possibly a user-space tool) which allowed
one to change the "priority" of IRQs and their handlers.  This was back
in the 1.2 or 2.0 days, when _any_ disk or other interrupt activity might
be enough to cause problems for serial connections (especially if you
only had a 16450 UART (1 byte buffer) instead of a 16550 (16 byte buffer).
You could make your serial interrupt (handler) take priority over disk
interrupts.
Maybe Ted Ts'o or other long-time Linux folks will know what was actually
called, and whether it is still applicable to modern hardware/kernel.
Cheers, Andreas
