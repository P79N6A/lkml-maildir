That's a little misleading: all your memory is consistent, the point
is that it is a shadow area of PCI-mappable memory.

Ah, ok, now I understand.  The issue here is actually nothing to do
with consistency, since your platform is fully consistent.  The issue
is that there are other constraints for DMAable memory and you want
drivers to be able to easily mallocate with those constraints.
Actually, it occurs to me that PC ISA DMA is in a similar situation -
there is a constraint on DMAable memory (sufficiently low physical
address) which has nothing to do with consistency.

Ok... see also my reply to one of James's posts.
