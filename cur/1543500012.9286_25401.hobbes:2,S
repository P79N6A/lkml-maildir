Well, I don't see what else it could be, since the fact is that with
exactly the same configuration, 2.2.9 works for me and 2.2.10 doesn't.
Sure it might have something to do with the hardware I have here (it's
a rack PC with the CPUs and basic I/O connectors on a card, so not
quite the "standard" PC), but still the problem definitely did appear
with the 2.2.10 patch.
The strange thing is that the hang occurs so early in the boot
process -- I don't even get the "Uncompressing kernel" message. I'm
not familiar enough with the innards of the kernel, but I would think
not much is running at that stage besides the uncompression code...
