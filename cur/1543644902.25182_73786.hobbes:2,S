Indeed, but I'd wonder why someone whould start syslogd on a r/o
filesystem, so probably /var/log/messages is not used at this time
anyway. You could set up syslogd to do remote logging to another machine
and fire it up before the troubles to capture anything. But of course
this requires
a) another machine
b) syslog set up on both sides for remote logging
c) a working network
An alternative would be to mount another disk with a different
filesystem (reiserfs/FAT) and log to there.
