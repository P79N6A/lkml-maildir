Yes, of course that would be fine. I started with the implicit 
assumption that the license could not change, sorry.
This might open another can of worms however. Once you get a binary blob 
into the kernel and you know that it really is code for an embedded 
microprocessor or such, what is the "preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it"? Wouldn't that be source code in whatever 
language that blob is written in? Wouldn't that also require a toolchain 
to build it? MY opinion is that it' much better to get it out of the 
kernel anyway.

I did not allege anything like that. I never doubted that Linus and most 
other maintainers do, in fact, understand legal things quite well, 
contrary to what SCO said or implied several times.
