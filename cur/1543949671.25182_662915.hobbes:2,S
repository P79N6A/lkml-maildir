No problem. Let's use __maybe_unsed then, it gives the same effect.

Subject: introduce pm_call() macro to get rid of most #ifdef CONFIG_PM
Currently drivers handle CONFIG_PM this way:
#ifdef CONFIG_PM
drv_suspend() {}
drv_resume() {}
#else
#define drv_suspend NULL
#define drv_resume NULL
#endif
struct driver drv = {
	.suspend = drv_suspend,
	.resume = drv_resume,
};
With this patch, the code above converts into:
__maybe_unused drv_suspend() {}
__maybe_unused drv_resume() {}
struct driver drv = {
	.suspend = pm_call(drv_suspend),
	.resume = pm_call(drv_resume),
};
GCC will optimize away suspend/resume calls if they're really
not used.
