This is what I currently have hacked into kcore.c which works (but
*will* break for non-ARM stuff.)
I suspect the easiest thing may be to arrange for the discontig direct
mapped memory blocks to appear on the vmlist and then remove the special
case for the direct mapped RAM.  I don't see why architecture support
needs to come into the picture really.
I don't believe any races here are that important (except of course
ensuring that we produce consistent data for a particular read() and
not oopsing the kernel) - take a moment to think where the information
/proc/kcore provides ends up and realise that as soon as it hits
userspace, you can't rely on it.  eg, Today, if you're using it and
you insert a module, the structure of the file changes, and gdb's
idea of offsets of data into the "core" becomes invalid.
