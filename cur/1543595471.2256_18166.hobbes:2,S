Hi,
> Shhh ;-)  Last time that hack was mentioned, someone wanted to _remove_
> it.  It's a very nice little hack to have around, and IKD uses it.
I am not saying it should be removed. But IMO it is a legitimate (if
not the originally intended) use of "start" to serve as a pointer to
a memory area allocated in the proc_read () function. This use is broken
with this hack in its current form, because reading from such a file
will fail depending on the (random) order of the page and start pointers.
If I understand the "hack" right, legitimate offsets generated for it
are always between 0 and PAGE_SIZE. Therefore the patch below would
not break it, while overcoming the abovementioned problem, because
legitimate page pointers will never be < PAGE_SIZE.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
Cheers,
Martin
