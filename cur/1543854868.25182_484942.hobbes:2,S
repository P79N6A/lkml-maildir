Subject: [PATCH] dont insert pipe dentries into dentry_hashtable.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We currently insert pipe dentries into the global dentry hashtable.
This is *suboptimal* because there is currently no way these entries can be 
used for a lookup(). (/proc/xxx/fd/xxx uses a different mechanism). Inserting 
them in dentry hashtable slow dcache lookups.
To let __dpath() still work correctly (ie not adding a " (deleted)") after 
dentry name, we do : 
- Right after d_alloc(), pretend they are hashed by clearing the 
DCACHE_UNHASHED bit. 
- Call d_instantiate() instead of d_add() : dentry is not inserted in hash 
table.
__dpath() & friends work as intended during dentry lifetime.
- At dismantle time, once dput() must clear the dentry, setting again 
DCACHE_UNHASHED bit inside the custom d_delete() function provided by pipe 
code, so that dput() can just kill_it.
This patch, combined with the next one (avoid RCU for never hashed dentries) 
reduced time of { pipe(p); close(p[0]); close(p[1]);} on my UP machine 
(1.6GHz Pentium-M) from 3.23 us to 2.86 us 
(But this patch does not depend on other patches, only bench results)
