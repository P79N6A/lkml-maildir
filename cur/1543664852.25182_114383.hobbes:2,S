Yes the kernel is uncompressed to the right location (0x200000), in my case. When I try to uncompress it to a non standard address (other than 0x100000), the address mapping is affected. Thats why I tried to change the PAGE_OFFSET value to 0xc0100000, which should be the right value corresponding to (0x200000). 
So the problem now is that, when a function is invoked it is unable to fetch the right physical address, since my address mapping (System.map) does not change when I change the value of PAGE_OFFSET and recompile the kernel.

The kernel should decompress itself to the right space anyway ... check
arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S ... should be minimal changes needed,
if any.
