Subject: [PATCH] Restore shmid as inode# to fix /proc/pid/maps ABI breakage

Andrew,
Can you include this in -mm ?
Thanks,
Badari
shmid used to be stored as inode# for shared memory segments. Some of
the proc-ps tools use this from /proc/pid/maps.  Recent cleanups
to newseg() changed it.  This patch sets inode number back to shared 
memory id to fix breakage.
