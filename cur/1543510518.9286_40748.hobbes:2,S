In the early '90s, this concept was very new, and we (at CMU) did a
lot of work on it.  Our final paper (from SIGCOMM'95) is under
http://www.acm.org/sigcomm/sigcomm95/sigcpapers.html,
 or I have a copy
at 
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~karl/general/95sigcomm.ps.
At the time, 100Mbps ether didn't exist, and the 80386 was
simultaneously new and boring (due to being slow).  We worked with
DecStation 5000s and later early Alphas with a custom-built (by NSC)
HIPPI interface, off the DS5K & Alpha turbochannel.  Manufacturing a
new mbuf type which contained iovecs was exactly what we did.
