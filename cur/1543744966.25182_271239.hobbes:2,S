You'll need invalidate_inodes-speedup.patch and
break-latency-in-invalidate_list.patch (or an equivalent).
That'll get you most of the way, but the BKL will still be a problem.
Removing lock_kernel() in the umount path is probably a major project so
for now, you can just drop and reacquire it by doing
release_kernel_lock()/reacquire_kernel_lock() around invalidate_inodes().
(You'll need to use that pair rather than unlock_kernel/lock_kernel because
it seems that invalidate_inodes can be called under various depths of
lock_kernel()).
