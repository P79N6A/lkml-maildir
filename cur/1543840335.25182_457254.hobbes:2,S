I still fail to imagine a useful case for printk("%s") to output non-printable
chars verbatim. I really think that the right solution would be for printk()
to output all non-printable chars escaped (eg: \n, \r, \xXX). It would
definitely fix the problem without removing useful information. I remember
having had the problem a long time ago with a name extracted from a string
supplied by the BIOS which mangled the dmesg at early boot.
It would be too much work (and too risky) to expect from all drivers to check
their strings for correctness, so the hardening way would be the best one IMHO.
Cheers,
Willy
