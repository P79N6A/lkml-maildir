I suspect you're in for a rough time of it.
There are a considerable number of gcc extensions to the C language, as
listed at:
  
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.3.3/gcc/C-Extensions.html#C
%20Extensions
and the Linux kernel uses quite a few of them.
What processor architecture is this that gcc doesn't run on it?
