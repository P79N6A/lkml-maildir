Hmm, wierd:
[~] tar jxf downloads/linux-2.6.21.5.tar.bz2
[~] cd linux-2.6.21.5/
[~/linux-2.6.21.5] patch -p1 --dry-run < ../quilt/i8042-trust-pnp-more.patch
patching file drivers/input/serio/i8042-x86ia64io.h
Hunk #1 succeeded at 313 (offset -43 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 361 (offset -43 lines).
[~/linux-2.6.21.5]
The patch must have gotten corrupted on the way to you. Let me try
resending it, but this time as an attachment.

Input: i8042 - give more trust PNP data on i386
On some boxes that don't have PS/2 mice connected at startup BIOS
completely disables AUX port and attempts to access it result in
hosed keyboard. Historically we do not trust ACPI/PNP data on
i386 and try to poke AUX port even if we did not find an active
PNP node for it. However in cases when BIOS writers got KBD port
properly described we can assume that they did the right thing
for AUX port as well.
