Yes you have a very good point there, that I mentioned in a private
e-mail.  The BIOS does that at bootup, so we would have to assume
control of that ourselves.  That wouldn't be too difficult, but would
add some housekeeping to the PCI layers -- mainly allocating and keeping
track of IRQs and base addresses/ranges.  We also have to be careful
to make sure we don't share IRQs with devices that don't want to share
them -- introducing the possibility the user could insert a card that
can't get an IRQ (ouch) because there are none available.  (Dang those
broken cards that don't share..  Why doesn't everybody just read the
friggin' PCI spec??? :) )
