This happens to me too (Asus A7V, KT133). It happens since I remember -
at least since Christmas, and for me it happens after unspecified time
after boot - varying from few seconds (during initscripts) to few
minutes. After it happens once, everything is apparently satisified
and no more spurious interrupts occurs (until next reboot). I always 
assumed that it is broken VIA again...
