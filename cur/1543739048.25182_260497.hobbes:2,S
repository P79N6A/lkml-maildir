There are systems, such as the P3-based Dell Inspirons and Latitutes
that caused the dmi blacklist to be implemented, that fail whether
they're using APM or ACPI. So in the interest of consistency, we should
either always automatically override the BIOS, requiring "nolapic" on
broken systems, or never automatically override the BIOS, requiring
"lapic" on systems that work but have stupid BIOSen.
None of this is ACPI-specific, so I don't like the idea of tying
auto-enable/disable to ACPI.
