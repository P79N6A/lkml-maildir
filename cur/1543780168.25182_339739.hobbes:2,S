Ok, true, but we should do a best effort.

I don't think we even need to think about such rare cases,
until the easy cases ("everything hangs when the cable is pulled") 
are not fixed.

That just makes netconsole useless in production. If it causes frequenet
hangs people will not use it.

You're solving a completely different issue here?
