Hi Sam,
Thanks for the review. This makes sense to me. Move const.h into
asm-generic and let everybody use it.
This is more of a small cleanup issue and involves changing few header files
in asm-sparc64 and make sure nothing is broken on sparc64. This patchset
is already becoming big and complex. Is it ok if we let the patch 
remain unmodified for now and once this gets in and settles down, I can
post another patch to do above modification?
Thanks
Vivek
