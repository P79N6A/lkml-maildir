It's hard to come up with a fix without knowing what's wrong.  The current 
development version of that subroutine is essentially the same as the 
version in 2.6.17.
If you want to pin down the problem more precisely, try adding a whole 
bunch of printk() statements to the quirk_usb_handoff_ohci() function in
drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c.
