OK, what about the patch below?

Make it clear that users usually shouldn't manually enable CONFIGFS_FS.

 config CONFIGFS_FS

 	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
 	help
 	  configfs is a ram-based filesystem that provides the converse
 	  of sysfs's functionality. Where sysfs is a filesystem-based
 	  view of kernel objects, configfs is a filesystem-based manager
 	  of kernel objects, or config_items.
 
 	  Both sysfs and configfs can and should exist together on the
 	  same system. One is not a replacement for the other.
 
+	  This option is provided for the case where no in-kernel-tree
+	  modules require configfs, but a module built outside the kernel
+	  tree does. Such modules require Y or M here.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.

 config RELAYFS_FS

 	---help---
 	  Relayfs is a high-speed data relay filesystem designed to provide
 	  an efficient mechanism for tools and facilities to relay large
 	  amounts of data from kernel space to user space.
 
 	  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be
 	  called relayfs.
 
 	  If unsure, say N.
