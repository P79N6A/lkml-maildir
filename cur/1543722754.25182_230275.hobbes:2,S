I have a much simpler idea that both implements the EQFS and doesn't 
touch the kernel.
Each user is given a quota which applies to their home directory.  (This 
quota is not elastic and if everyone met their quota, everything would 
fit.)  In addition, there is another directory or file system (could be 
on the same disk or even the same partition) to which their quota 
doesn't apply AT ALL.  Let's call this "scratch" space.
Periodically, a daemon checks the disk usage, and whenever the disk 
usage approaches, say, 90%, its starts deleting the oldest files from 
the scratch space until its gets below the watermark.
So anything in "/scratch/$USER/" is free to be deleted by the daemon.
BTW, they did something similar to this when I was in college (I 
graduated in 1996), although they deleted from /scratch manually.
