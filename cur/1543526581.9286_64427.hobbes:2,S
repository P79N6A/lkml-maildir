Mike, frankly I don't understand your concern :)) - want to protect the
encrypted from anyone, including root? Make a driver that understands the fs
structure, sends the client read data, but doesn't decrypt it - this task
belongs to the client. You protect the client with the password - root can
read the fs (encrypted), can sniff the connection (data still encrypted),
but if the client is additionally tunnelled with, say, ssh - root can only
dream that reading kmem would reveal any data - if the encrypted data is
tunnelled to another machine, the data leaves the source machine encrypted.
Only the person that knows the client's password can read the data.
