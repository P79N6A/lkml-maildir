Hello,
I wish to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments posted to the list in 
response to this post .
The I/O devices are equipped with dedicated processor to free the  main CPU 
from doing the low level I/O operations. However, if i am editing and 
updating a big size file and i want to save
it afterwards, i  notice my PC getting blocked while saving the file which 
theoritically should NOT happen as it is up to the I/O device processor and 
not the main CPU to save the data into the disk; the main CPU could switch 
to another process after giving the high level command -save-to the device 
processor; so why the main CPU is blocked while saving such big size files
thanks
