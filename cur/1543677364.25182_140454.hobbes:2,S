   can we have the TCP retransmit side take a performance hit if it needs to 
   realign buffers?
You don't understand, the person who mangles the packet
must make the copy, not the person not doing the packet
modifications.
   for a "high performance app" requiring gigabit-type speeds,
...we probably won't be using ppc64 and e1000 cards, yes, I agree
:-)
Anton, go to the local computer store and pick up some tg3
cards or a bunch of Taiwan specials :-)
