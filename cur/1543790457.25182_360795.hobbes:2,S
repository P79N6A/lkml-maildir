sb_bread is used to read the blocks containing file-system data not
the files, and for writing file-system data blocks back to storage
mark_buffer_dirty and sync_dirty_buffer functions are used as you can
see in the function ext2_sync_super (I am not FS expert, rather just
worked on it for understanding because i am going to use file-system's
stuff in my current project). sb_bread is actually reading the data
from the storage directly means with-out going through the
buffer_cache layer.

I am pretty sure that pages here will be refering to the file data,
and as far as unmounting case is concern, synching of the file data
might be done so you are noticing them called by the VFS layer for
writing the un-synched data of file to storage.

I can't say much about this, but I think writepages are called by VFS
layer might be with nr_pages=1, so that a single page can be written
with small data ! Have you checked the nr_pages field when it is
called ?

AFAIR there are books which contain chapters explaining the
file-systems like EXT2/3 and you can also search for "Simple File
System" or "sfs" on the google for the code of small file-system which
works upto 64MB storage but on the real device not on the memory !
