Ok, I think I led you on a merry goose-chase, and the "base == 1" check 
was the only one worth bothering with after all. Sorry about that.

The do_div() optimization is a trivial one, and one that gcc should 
definitely have recognized. It's not like a compiler cannot see that you 
have a 64 / 32 divide, and realize that it's cheaper than a full 64 / 64 
divide.
But hey, even if the gcc people finally did that optimization today, it 
would take a few years before we didn't support old compilers any more, 
so.

Yes. There are tons of places where we'd love to have a constant
compile-time "log2()" function. And yes, I could do it in sparse in about
ten more lines of code, but..
I guess you could do it with a lot of tests...  Something like this should
do it
	#define __constant_log2(y) ((y==1) ? 0 : \
				    (y==2) ? 1 : \
				    (y==4) ? 2 : \
				    (y==8) ? 3 : -1)	/* We could go on ... */
	#define do_div(x,y) ({					\
		unsigned long __mod;				\
		int __log2;					\
		if (__builtin_constant_p(y) && 			\
		    !((y) & ((y)-1)) &&				\
		    (__log2 = __constant_log2((y))) >= 0) {	\
			mod = x & ((y)-1);			\
			(x) >>= __log2;				\
		} else {					\
			.. inline asm case ..			\
		}						\
		__mod; })
which looks like it should work, but it's getting so ugly that I suspect I 
should be committed for even thinking about it.
(And no, I didn't test the above. It is all trivially optimizable by a 
compiler, and I can't see how gcc could _fail_ to get it right, but hey, I 
thought the previous thing would work too, so I'm clearly not competent to 
make that judgement... ;)
