The kernel locks up completely whenever I launch any particularly large 
application under X (xterm is fine, netscape locks up the box).
I've confirmed that this isn't just X locking up, as the machine is 
completely frozen (doesn't respond to pings, doesn't respond to three 
finger salute, etc).
Just to make sure that this isn't a VM/Memory problem:
I've run (and the machine passed) memtest86.
I've tried running X with swapoff (and the machine still locks up).
- Kernel 2.4.19
- GLIBC 2.2.90
- XFree86 4.2.0
I can reproduce this error every single time I run X.  However, I have 
not been able to see the problem on the shell.
Anyone ever see this problem?  Does anyone have pointers on how I can 
better troubleshoot the problem?
