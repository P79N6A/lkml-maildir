Sorry, my brain must have been overheating, I missed this in my other 
reply to your post, when I asked what drive.
Don't know if case cooling would have any bearing on this or not, but I 
think I'll run some tests of my own.  I seem to recall one incident 
while I was unrolling a tarball off a CD onto a hard drive, that 
happened to involve a VIA chipset.  I'll see if I can reproduce the 
incident.
