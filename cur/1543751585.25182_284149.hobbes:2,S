Subject: SCHED_BATCH not stopped (swsusp fails)

SCHED_BATCH processes dont seem to heed the `stop' request (order?) by
swsusp.  I run httpd and mysqld (for my wiki page) with SCHED_BATCH (so
that I can work on my computer even if the load is very high) but when I
try to suspend the system, it tries to stop the tasks and simply returns.
Here is the dmesg output (paritial)
#dmesg
