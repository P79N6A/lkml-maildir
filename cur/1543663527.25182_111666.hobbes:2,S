This is interesting. Very interesting, even. A plain UP_APIC kernel
(with IO_APIC not enabled or not detected) shouldn't need to touch
APIC_ID at all. I strongly suspect this is a remnant of apic.c's old
SMP-only history, and that it should be removed for UP_APIC-only.
I need to get some downtime (zzz...) but I'll look into this ASAP.
