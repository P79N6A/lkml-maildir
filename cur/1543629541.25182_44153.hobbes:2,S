Hi
as vanilla linux 2.5.13 compiled beautifully for me
last night one I couldn't resist the temptation to
boot it up and give it a whirl on my workstation (a
monoprocessor AMD  ATHLON on VIA motherboard with
recent 20GB IDE disk and EXT2 file system, NVIDIA
video card). 
Boot went OK until a message something like "checking
filesystems - check forced -mounted  31 times without
verification - verifying now". Shortly afterwards I
got an OOPS message. 
EIP : 0010: [<c01d59cb> Not Tainted
....
<0> Kernel Panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler! In
interrupt handler - not syncing
Not to worry I try to reboot my stable kernel - this
fails at the mount command (library's needed by mount
command are missing). Impossible to login (password
file must be corrupted too). 
With the rescue disk I run e2fsck and home partition
is  dead (bad superblocks) and nothing recoverable.
The root file system is also corrupted (bad
superblocks but not as badly as home). I have some
other partitions which I haven't checked yet - maybe
some of them survived. 
As I am not subscribed to the list please CC me in any
response. If I can recover the kernel compile I will
try to give some configuration options and try to
decode the full oops message. More details available
on request.
Best regards

P.S. 
 The hard disk is using VIA bus master PCI IDE and the
distribution is a "vanilla" mandrake 8.1. I have a
REALTEK  RTL8029 Ethernet Adaptor. USB is with VIA
VT83C572/VT82C586 PCI to VIA Universal Host
controller.
