Subject: 2.6.10 USB devices generate descriptor read error?

Is anybody else having a similar problem as the
following...
My USB keydrives use to work fine in 2.6.9.
Since I upgraded to 2.6.10 now they just
generate a device descriptor read error.
Specifically:
/var/log/kern.log.0:Jan 26 18:18:18 mail kernel: usb 4-2.1:
device descriptor read/64, error -32
Also I noticed that a new Sigmatel based USB IRDA
device also produces similar messages...
/var/log/kern.log:Jan 27 12:31:19 mail kernel: usb 2-2: device
descriptor read/64, error -71
Is this a known problem or is it just me?
I noticed that the precompiled debian 2.6.10 kernel
works with at least the usb flash drive ok.  But my
compiled version produces the above.
But I don't think I changed any relevant kernel config
items from 2.6.9 to 2.6.10 and I've compiled lots of
USB enabled kernels before so I'd like to think I'm
not an idiot but maybe I missed a new option or
something.
Please help,
- Jeff
