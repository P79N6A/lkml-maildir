People are used to a mrproper that does NOT delete their editor
backup files and patch rejects. Thats the only arguments against
mrproper=distclean.
The main purpose should be to have a clear and logical
distingush between the two/three.
As it is today people are confused, and there is no consistency - 
especially between architectures.
I'm fine with a change that moves MRPROPER_{DIRS,FILES} to clean - except
.config.
But I'm not fine with the current situation where I have to say goodbye
to all my .rej files + xx~ files just to force a full recompile.
I will do a new patch tomorrow.
