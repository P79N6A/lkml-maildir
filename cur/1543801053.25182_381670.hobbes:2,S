2.6.14 was indeed the latest mainline/Linus release, all the 2.6.14.x
kernels were -stable kernels released by the -stable team, and when
2.6.15 shows up noone knows how many further -stable kernels the team
will release for 2.6.14 (most likely 1 at most, but it's not set in
stone).

but, a 2.6.14.6 kernel might come out *after* 2.6.15, then what?
There's a 2.6.15 patch on the kernel.org frontpage that's a 2.6.14 ->
2.6.15 delta, if people are using 2.6.14.x then I think it's fair to
assume they have that .x patch around somewhere (or know where to find
it) and can easily revert it to then apply the 2.6.15 patch.
