Not really. 
It should prevent _future_ abuse.
The notion of "preventing existing xxx" is insane. You can't "prevent" 
something that already happened unless you've come up with some new 
interesting theory of causality.

I do. The thing is, the people who _notice_ the breakage are often the 
people who don't know what the hell to do about it.
The way to prevent _future_ abuse is by adding something like
	#ifndef __KERNEL__
	#warning "This really doesn't work"
	#endif
which does that, and has the advantage of not breaking anything at all.
In other words: if you want to move things around just to break things, 
THEN THAT IS INCREDIBLY STUPID. We don't do things to screw our users 
over. 
Feel free to send a patch.
