Yeah, I talked with Daniel too about it. I need to look more into it.
I haven't had time since I'm spending the weekend (Monday too, since it's
a holiday in the US), moving to my new house.
There is a race, but honestly, it will be a merical to happen, and if it
does, it only gives the results that we had "before" the patches ;-)
But take them out, until I get to the bottom of them. But that won't be
until "earliest" Tuesday.
Thanks,
