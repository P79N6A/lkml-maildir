Well, the ntfs driver from the 2.4.20 vanilla kernel has really dangerous
write support for the ntfs partitions. It is strongly discouraged to use
it.
You can use though the backport driver from the 2.5 kernel series (aka
ntfs-tng). It allows you to overwrite the files using mmap() and write().
So, neither size changes, nor attribute changes. You'll find mode detailes
along with the driver itself at 
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/.

Not really. See
