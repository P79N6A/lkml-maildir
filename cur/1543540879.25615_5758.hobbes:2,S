Hi, 
I don't really know if this could be a kernel bug or not but ...
The problem turns around cpu temperature when it is idle. I'm one of those
pc users that take care about cpu temperature, and as i've not been able to 
make the lm-sensors program work, I test temperature with a digital thermometer
attached directly to cpu.
Well, it sounds strange but if I boot my machine into my 2.2.16 kernel,
login into console, execute 'top' to see system idle 99.8%, then cpu temperature
keeps growing and growing as if I'd be recompiling kernel now and then.
But if I get into an X session (e.g. KDE), and stay doing nothing again,
then cpu temperature inmediatly starts going down to get to it's normal
operation temperature in 5 minutes or so.
And, if I turn again into console mode, then temperature starts growing quickly again.
It does the same with a 2.2.13 kernel, but temperature doesn't grow up so much,
neither as quickly as with 2.2.16 one.
It seems as if linux kernel could not properly send HALT instruction to cpu while
not being under X. ¿?
Kernel is compiled with this options:
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
System:
AOpen AX6BC Pro Gold (BX chipset)
Celeron 466
128MB PC100 SDRAM
Riva TNT2
Opti931 Soundcard
Realtek 8139 Fast Ethernet
Miro PCTV Bt848
If you consider this is not a bug, I'd like you to give me a clue about the
cause of this behaviour. And if you want me to send you more info, feel free
to email me.
My opinion is that if this is a general behaviour for everybody, then it's a thing
to take care cause temperature can produce system malfunction and decreases
stability.
Regards.
