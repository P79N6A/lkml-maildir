doh myself. :) this won't be very helpful though, as i get the same on 
all machines (with both drivers):
Offload parameters for eth0:
Cannot get device rx csum settings: Operation not supported
Cannot get device tx csum settings: Operation not supported
Cannot get device scatter-gather settings: Operation not supported
Cannot get device tcp segmentation offload settings: Operation not supported
no offload info available
> ethtool -k eth0 rx off tx off
ditto. i'll try to reproduce this on a machine with e1000 though...
cheers
