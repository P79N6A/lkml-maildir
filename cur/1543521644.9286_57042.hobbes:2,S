Nope. All of these terminate the process. I believe what is desired is
more like:
	kill -STOP pid
Which will suspend the process. Use the debugger to look at memory.
Other than this, I don't know of a way to extract the core dump.
After looking at the suspended process, remember to do
	kill -CONT pid
to resume it.
