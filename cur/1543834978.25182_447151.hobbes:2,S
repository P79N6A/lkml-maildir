Sure, you don't need any data to estimate anything.
But if your estimate is based on bad data it sounds better than if it 
was based on no data although the value of the estimate is the same.

Giving low quality raw data and then saying "it wasn't me who did the 
estimate" is silly.

That's completely wrong.
I consider those results neither positive nor negative for reiser4.
They could only be considered positive if someone expected less than
35 reiser4 users worldwide.

And 90% of all people will misread it.
And many people will spread it wrong.
That's exactly where such data is worse than no data.
You could claim you know your the suboptimal quality of the data and 
that you had a disclaimer.
But did you read Hans' reaction on your email?
If you are intelligent (which I assume), you should have learned by this 
how to not present your data.

I have no plans to use reiser4 myself (I'm a happy ext2 user).
But I'm not against mergng reiser4, either.
I'll leave this technical discussion to the people who know more about 
this.
