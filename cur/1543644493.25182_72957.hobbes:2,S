   Surely we wouldn't want to define a new API that can't be supported on
   all 32-bit platforms, no?  Perhaps writeq_nonatomic()?
I'm saying we define writeq() to be implementable as two 32-bit
transations, that will be the API.
I think adding some weird new writeq_nonatomic() will just create
more confusion than it saves.
