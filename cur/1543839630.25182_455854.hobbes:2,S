I agree about the rest and I'm certainly not trying to make life easy
to the binary only drivers, but for completeness I'd like to add that
IBM at some point released binary only drivers for some virtual device
on s390. I think they're all GPL by now, but my point remains that
even IBM must have thought they could legally ship binary only drivers
in the past (like everybody else did until recently after all).
My only worry is what's the legal status of the vsyscall if the only
thing that matters is the COPYING file and not its generally agreed
interpretation.
