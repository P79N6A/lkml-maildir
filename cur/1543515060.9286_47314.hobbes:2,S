Subject: How do I get heap and static memory information for /proc?

Hi,
I am trying to figure out where I can dynamically figure out information
about the Heap.  The /proc/self/stat gives information
about the stack like where the stack begins and the size (at least
that's what it looks like).  But I can't find out where to find that
information about the heap (ie, where it begins and the size of the
heap).  I need similiar information about the static data
area which I can hopefully glean from the /proc because I have to do it
at run time.
I have found information about /proc/self/maps.  I have found that the
second and third entries are the static data segment and the heap
segment respectively.  But I am still not sure if this is always the
case.  I am still looking a more detailed information what is in the
maps file.  I have also looked at the man page for /proc.
If anyone has ideas about where to look for more information and can
answer my questions, your help will be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks
Usman
