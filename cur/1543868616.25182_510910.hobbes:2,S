Well it is starting to look like it isn't a caching issue, but more
likely an issue of which order writes are performed in.  I think the MAC
might be seeing the ownership bit change before the rest of the
descriptor, which shouldn't happen.  With X86_OOSTORE, wmb() is called
between setting the fields in the descriptor and setting the ownership
bit to the MAC.  I still have to investigate a bit more to find out for
sure, but that could certainly explain why X86_OOSTORE makes the problem
become much less frequent.  It doesn't completely elliminate it though.
Of course maybe there are two different problems with the same symptoms.
