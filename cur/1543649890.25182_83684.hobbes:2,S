I've always wanted something like this.  It really is not too difficult to
do, but it is entirely a library problem.

unlimited groups requires a TRIVIAL change to libc.

gahh..Why does the kernel need to know about a group and members?  At login
time (or rather, setgroups() time, likely login, but could be other)
getgrent() or whatnot does a full expansion on the nested group file
(handling recursion properly!).  You call setgroups() with the full list of
GIDs for your user.  The kernel should not know about a group beyond a GID,
unless we're talking about vastly different semantics than traditional users
and groups.

Line length is/was an real issue.  Last I tried to do something like having
5000 users in a group, libc would not parse it.  Can't say I've tried
lately.  That, however, is another purely library problem.

No, it wouldn't work on NFS except to another system which understands this
scheme.  The patch I proposed uses CoW grouplists.  This is good
enough for the vast majority of cases - not too many apps call setgroups()
themselves, being a restricted syscall, and all that.

So have I, but it is a different problem...Patches should be sent to
glibc developers.
