So now everyone writing commercial apps for Linux are going to set
SO_CRITICAL on sockets in their apps so their apps can "survive better
under pressure than the competitors aps" and clueless programmers all
over are going to think "cool, with this I can make my app more
important than everyone elses, I'm going to use this".  When everyone
and his dog starts to set this, what's the point?

Hmm, so if I fire up an app that has SO_CRITICAL set on a socket and
can then somehow put a lot of memory pressure on the machine I can
cause traffic on other sockets to be dropped.. hmmm.. sounds like
something to play with to create new and interresting DoS attacks...

To be a little serious, it sounds like something that could be used to
cause trouble and something that will lose its usefulness once enough
people start using it (for valid or invalid reasons), so what's the
point...
