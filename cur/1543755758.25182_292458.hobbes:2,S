Recent 2.6 does a more advanced form of port randomization already
using address hash at connect time.  tcp_v4_get_port is only used for the case
of applications that explicitly bind to port zero to find a free port.
So the sequence:
	socket(); connect(); 
will assign a random port in a manner similar to sequence number creation
The sequence:
	socket(); bind(); connect();
assigns a simple linear increasing port value.  It could be randomized, but
most applications don't bother binding, so the first case is sufficient.
