So executing "make KBUILD_VERBOSE=0 defconfig"
results in ~930 lines of output, including one warning message.
What I request is that conf outputs essential stuff only, for example
warnings.
That would remove 900 lines of output when building a kernel,
and maybe people actually paid attention to the warnings generated
by kconfig.
In general I prefer minimum output when building the kernel, without
loosing the ability to follow progress.
One reason why we have some of the warnings left all around in the kernel is
due to the fact people does not see them when building their drivers etc.
With default options to make, warnings simply does not show up as visible,
and when the build proceeds the relevant parts scroll out.
See my point now?
Also speaking about warnings. How about sticking in a "warning:",
to make the format gcc compatible.
Something like attacted patch.
