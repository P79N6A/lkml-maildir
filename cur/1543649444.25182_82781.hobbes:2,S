Hardware restriction.  Somebody read that "all locks can be implemented
in terms of a single hardware primitive" and believed it :(.  The only
atomic operation on parisc is load and clear word.  According to the
comments in asm-parisc/atomic.h, atomic_set should not require a lock,
but it is coded to use one.  Atomic add/sub obviously needs a lock.
