And further, this "consistent call environment" is *required* for correct
operation of certain callers, e.g. invalidate_bh_lrus(), whose callback
function is invalidate_bh_lru().  If invalidate_bh_lru() is called without
IRQs blocked, it might be interrupted by an IPI that causes nested execution
of that same function on behalf of another cpu's call to on_each_cpu(), and
this can lead to duplicate brelse() calls on a buf head (and ultimately to
ext3 journaling crashes due to invalid concurrent use of that buf head).
