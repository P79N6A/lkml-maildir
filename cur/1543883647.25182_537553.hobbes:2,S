The compiler is fine, it's the setCx86() macro that is utter crap
because it fails to behave like a function by not evaluating its
arguments before performing its outb() statements.
Converting them to static inlines would be the best solution. Something like
static inline u8 getCx86(unsigned int reg)
{
	outb(reg, 0x22);
	return inb(0x23);
}
static inline void setCx86(unsigned int reg, u8 data)
{
	outb(reg, 0x22);
	outb(data, 0x23);
}
ought to work.
