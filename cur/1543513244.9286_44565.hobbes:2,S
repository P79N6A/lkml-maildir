My monitor appears to shut itself off when using any smp kernel (tried
2.2.12, 2.3.18-22) .. it only seems to happen with smp.. could this be
because my chipset is overhearing or something? The machine it still
telnetable, but I can't get the monitor up at all.
I also get those APIC ESR messages too; abit bp6.
Any help would be appreciated.
