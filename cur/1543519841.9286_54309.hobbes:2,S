I am aware of this, I have even seen IDE implementations where people
connect the IDE data lines directly to the CPU bus without buffering -
veeery scary.

This is still way better than enforcing the use of
disable_irq()/enable_irq() on everybody. Even on the PC it should be
fairly noticeable to branch to a sub routine that disables the
device's interrupt with a writel() rather than going out to the PIC
and doing it there.

This has nothing to do with being m68k nor IDE specific, my point is
that no generic device layer has enough information about interrupt
sources to know whether an interrupt is shared or not.
