Thanks. 
I moved further with the 2.6.20 sata_mv driver. Here
are the excerpts from dmesg with ata3 error messages
as follows:
sata_mv 0000:00:0d.0: version

scsi3 : sata_mv               
physmap flash device: 800000 at 1f400000 
  What is the significance of the
ata3: qc timeout (cmd 0xef)                           
ata3: failed to set xfermode, disabled 
 I am not able to get to the drive as attach is not
happening yet.
Thanks for the help.
