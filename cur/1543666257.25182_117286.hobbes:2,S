I'd suggest you hit 
http://www.mandrakesoft.com/search?query=Red
+Hat&l=english
and you'll see all of 9 instances of the term Red Hat on their web site and
I can't find a single one where they are saying what you say they are saying.
I'm not sure why you think what you do but it's simply incorrect.  Brand name
is a well established business asset and businesses are absolutely allowed,
and as someone else mentioned (thanks), obligated to protect.
