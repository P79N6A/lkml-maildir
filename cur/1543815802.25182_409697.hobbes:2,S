It would be more like
	$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=Makefile count=2
	$ git commit Makefile
        $ git checkout HEAD^ Makefile
        $ git commit Makefile

... because the point is that the end-result tree being what is
desired is not the only thing that matters, but the history to
get there should not have unnecessary garbage.
I am curious how you found it initially.  After you pulled but
before you did further work on top of the updated HEAD, I am
suspecting that there is some sanity check done by you to detect
that you pulled a faulty tree and decide to discard the merge.
It might help to share that with your subsystem maintainers, so
that they can do the same when merging from their feeders.
