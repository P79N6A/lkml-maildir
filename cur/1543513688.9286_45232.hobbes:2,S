One word: YUCK!
Type typedef's are a pain when there is no real reason for them,
ie. for atomic types and spin locks there is a good reason, for simple
pointers there aren't. The term 'physaddr' referring to things to be
used with ioremap() is just bogus, ioremap takes a bus address not a
physical one.
Addind yet another random typedef just makes the code even more
obfuscated. You will be able to do just as much damage with this new
type as you can do with unsigned long's. Basic rule is that you need
to know what you are doing anyway.
