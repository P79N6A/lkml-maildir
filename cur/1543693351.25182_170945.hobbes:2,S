Subject: [Resent 2.6 patch] Correct case sensitivity in make mandocs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/10/6/273

The attached patch corrects case sensitivity in the mandocs make target. XML is
case insensitive, and a bunch of the kernel-doc assumes this. The makeman and
splitman scripts incorrectly cared about case. This patch also updates the
Docbook DTD version which the script generates.
Cheers,
Mikal
