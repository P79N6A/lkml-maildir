Yes, when the BIOS is trustworthy that sounds reasonable. 
The nasty theoretical case I can think of is what happens when that
annoying PCI device is behind a bridge?  How do we reserve the
bridge resources and become a child of them?

The case I care about is BIOS ROMS.  That case is fun because frequently
the reserved region is smaller than region the ROM sits in.  But it
really comes down to trusting the BIOS.  And anytime we trust the BIOS
to do the right thing some BIOS will do it wrong.  So when we have a
conflict and we know we are right I would much rather throw away what
the BIOS has told me.
If we are somehow scanning the busses and stop and oh wait there is a
bridge above everything that I had not noticed before.  And in a root
complex (the pci express term) where the resources are non standard, I
can really see this happening.  I know on Opteron systems we currently
omit the resources on the cpu/HT chain.  That is what I think
insert_resource was designed for.
And there was another case a few days ago where someone was having
similar BIOS problems with the AGP GART window.
