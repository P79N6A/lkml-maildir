Please use
	git diff -M
for things like this.
In fact, even if you weren't a git user, I'd ask you to *become* one just 
because I think that it's a *lot* more productive if people actually see 
renames as renames, and will see what - if anything - changed when 
renaming.
The "-M" flag isn't the default, simply because it generates patches that 
cannot be applied with regular "patch", but for something like this, I 
think it's practically imperative. The old kind of "remove file" + "add 
file" patch just isn't acceptable when there are very viable alternaties.
You don't even have to use a git repository to use a git rename patch - 
you just need to use "git apply" to apply it.
