I'm getting a kernel panic in running 2.6.0test8 which I just compiled
today.
After chatting this up with #Kernelnewbies, erikm told me to post here.

Attempt to mount a particular CD, which I'm thinking is just an ordinary
data CD.
It could be a VCD, but then I would suspect it would play on my DVD player.
Windows sees it as a data disk with one big AVI file on it.
Anyway, I was impressed by the magical symbol lookups in the crash dump,
but I really just want to mount my CD.
I am not subscribed to this list, so please CC me on any correspondence.
I will gladly help debug this.
