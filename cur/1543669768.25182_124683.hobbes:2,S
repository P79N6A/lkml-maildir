Oh please.
This is my network, and there is nothing
insane about it - FYI the stock 2.4.18 RH
kernel had severe stability problems on
this system - OTOH 2.5.67-mm1 is like
the rock of gibraltar in comparison.

Sorry,  -mm fixes a number of bugs that
render the vanilla kernel unusable for me.

By running 2.5 and reporting, maybe we
can help expose those bugs - but since .65
or so, I haven't really seen any show stopper
issues - everything works, and works well,
on my particular hardware, and workload.

My clients get official vendor kernels, but
in the sanctity of my own domain I run the
latest and greatest and take a look at what's
coming - what I'm running today is a sneak
preview of what my clients will be running
tomorrow.
