here it is in english ;)
This driver emulates a standard UART using the SPORT peripherals on a
Blackfin processor.

i'm not sure i follow ... these are the names given to request_irq()
which means this is what shows up in /proc/interrupts ... does this
function also create an actual file somewhere in /proc that i am not
aware of ?
the rest of the comments look good to me, thanks !
