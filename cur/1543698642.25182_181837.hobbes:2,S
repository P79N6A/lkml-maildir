As I wrote above, for XFS use XFS_IOC_GETBMAPX and read only the blocks in
use from the disk and dump a preallocated buffer filled with zeros for the
holes.
For other filesytems you should use FIBMAP but it's so inefficient,
limited, etc that probably it's not worth doing because in general you
would end up being slower.
