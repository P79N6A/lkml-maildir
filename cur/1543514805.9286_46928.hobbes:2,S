Agreed.  It's just asking for trouble.  The only time I use
software delay loops is on a processor where _I_ control the
clock speed and I have no other choice...

It's just a few instructions at assembly level.  Windows
virtual device drivers (oh the horror) have access to a
function which returns a 64 bit count of roughly 0.8 usec
intervals since boot.  It's nothing more than current timer
contents + (divider * overflows since boot).  Implementing
a delay wouldn't require anywhere near as much, you just need
to be a little careful if the current value plus delay wraps.
