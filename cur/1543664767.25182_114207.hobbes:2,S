Well why not make mapcount an "int" and move the places where it is modified
inside pte_chain_lock()?
That does not increase the number of atomic operations, and it makes me stop
wondering if this:
                if (atomic_read(&page->pte.mapcount) == 0)
                        inc_page_state(nr_mapped);
is racy ;)
