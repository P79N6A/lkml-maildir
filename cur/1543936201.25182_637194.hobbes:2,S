More information. You have not provided any speculation as to why it doesn't work, or what you've done to figure it out. You haven't even described how it fails, just that it does. No information about what cards you've tested and how you've tested them to confirm that your theory on 4-bit data is accurate.
You have no track record with me, and you're proposing something that goes against all known information. So you have to understand that I'm sceptical about your claims. I won't dismiss them off hand, but I need to be convinced you haven't made a mistake when coming to this conclusion.

Fair enough. But if it's a new driver that hasn't seen real-world testing, then there might be other bugs influencing things.
