I am also seeing similar problems with 2.3.41, but not 2.3.40.  But
here, it is the hdb interrupt that is missed.
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.30
PIIX3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL1080A, ATA DISK drive
hdb: Maxtor 92720U8, ATA DISK drive
ide2: ports already in use, skipping probe
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL1080A, 1039MB w/83kB Cache, CHS=528/64/63
hdb: Maxtor 92720U8, 25965MB w/2048kB Cache, CHS=3310/255/63

I will also try both of these.
By the way, I initially considered that my problem might be an interrupt
controller problem, since in one crash event, my ethernet card, a 3com
vortex, got stuck in a flood of interrupts.
