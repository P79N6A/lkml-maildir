Hello,
i wrote a kernel driver which sends data as payload of an udp packet via
a udp kernel socket.
The problem is that _not_ every sock_sendmsg() call puts a packet onto
the wire. Instead the data from several sock_sendmsg() calls will be
merged in one big udp packet and then put on the wire. (Is THAT called
CORK?)
How can i force the kernel to put one udp packet per sock_sendmsg()
call (immediately ) onto the wire?
Please CC because i am not a subscriber of this list!
