Hi,
> nf-hipac is a drop-in replacement for the iptables packet filtering module.
> It implements a novel framework for packet classification which uses an
> advanced algorithm to reduce the number of memory lookups per packet.
> The module is ideal for environments where large rulesets and/or high
> bandwidth networks are involved. Its userspace tool, which is also called
> 'nf-hipac', is designed to be as compatible as possible to 'iptables -t
> filter'.
Looks great!
Any chance on a port to 2.5.x?
