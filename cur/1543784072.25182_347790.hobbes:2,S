If you really need C++ then creating your own ruleset in the Kbuild file
should do the trick.
Something like:
$(obj)/file.o: $(src)/file.cc
And you must provide rules for .cc -> .o
The link part may prove a bit difficult since you may have to link .c
and C++ code. Again writing your own linker ruler is probarly the way
forward.
I can give at a short look if you send something like a minimum set of
sample files (mixed .c and .C++ where you have tried doing some of the
obvious stuff yourself).
This is not about adding C++ to mainstrem kernel if someone thinks so,
this is just about helping Marco.
