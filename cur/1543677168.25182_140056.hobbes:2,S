I'm not sure if this is related to recent TTY changes or not, but this
does bring up a small 'issue'.  To get at uart_port, you need
<linux/serial_core.h>, which currently requires but does not #include
<linux/tty.h>.  But I haven't been following close enough to know if
this is new breakage due to TTY changes or just no one had done
linux/serial_core.h w/o linux/tty.h before..
