See my previous response to Greg.
The only outstanding build issue is that the userspace stuff gets
rebuilt unconditionally on every make, and I don't know why.  You're
welcome to clone the repo at 
http://klibc.bkbits.net:8080/2.5-klibc
 and
figure it out.

The build integration in the repo above is based on Kai's changes,
forward ported from 2.5.60 or so.  You are more than welcome to prettify
the hacking I had to do to get it working.
