  Hello,
  I've released cogito-0.18.1, bringing few minor new features and
random bugfixes to the cogito-0.18 version. Nothing groundshattering.
* cg-switch -c as a shortcut for cg-switch -r HEAD - use it to create a new
  branch with less typing
* cg-patch -e to edit log message before autocommitting (useful esp. as
  cg-patch -m -e)
* Support for cg-version --lib-dir, --share-dir
* cg-admin-rewritehist now defines a map() function for filters' use,
  translating from old to new commit ids
* cg-commit -e now runs editor on /dev/tty even if input is not a tty
* Trivial documentation improvements
* Random details fixed
  Happy hacking,
--
