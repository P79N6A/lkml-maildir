Subject: [PATCH] i2c-core: i2c bitbang gpio structure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi folks,
A new structure is added to i2c-core for GPIO-based I2C interface
adapter. My latest GPIO based I2C adapter driver for Blackfin system
will use this stuff. And also IXP4XX GPIO based I2C driver can also be
moved to this.
