ok - according to unistd.h we now have exactly 256 syscalls allocated (unless im missing something).  my code needs to be able to account for every single possible syscall and so i need to be able to store the syscall number in a standard way.  not all syscalls are catered for on the outset by at any time the user can say "i need to use syscall x which takes y parameters" and the code will be able to take care of it.
the problem is that i am currently reserving only 8 bits for the syscall number.  this is ok for now but if we ever get another syscall its going to be unuseable by my existing code :) - should i be reserving 16 bits now in preperation for some new syscalls being added ?
