Nice. :-) and :-(
With that patch, now I'm happy user of 2.6.0 ;-)
[I was that since 2.6.0-test1, but only on one machine of mine, where fb
 was not important at all]
My only question is: why was fb layer modofied to a state which is UNUSABLE
without a patch which reverts to the 2.4 interface? I'm trying to search
archives and various document, and now I've got the feeling that several
author thinks fbcon only a toy and its ONLY purpose to get the tux logo
on booting. Which is completly false of course ;-(
SORRY (!) if I missunderstood something ...
Or at least please give me some points what is the advantage of the
framebuffer in the state it exists in the official 2.6.0 if it is unusable.
Or maybe I've missed something. My only headache that I would like know
what is the goal with fb in 2.6.x then?
And again: sorry, I would not like to be offensive or something, but I'm
really interested in this topic!
