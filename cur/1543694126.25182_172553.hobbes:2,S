With netlink you may receive the data asynchronously however you
wish after you've requested a dump.
I would like to ask that you go study how netlink works and is used
by things like routing daemons before we discuss this further as
it looks to me like half the conversation is going to be showing
you how netlink works.  And hey there's even an RFC on netlink :)
