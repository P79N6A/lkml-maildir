Thats one of the problems I am seeing on x86 as well. Recovering
wall-time precisely after sleep is tough esepcially if the interrupt
source (PIT) and backing-time source (TSC/PM Timer/HPET) can
drift wrt each other. PPC64 should be much better I hope (which is what I 
intend to take up next).

Tony was using it to signal that all CPUs are idle and timer are
being skipped. With the SMP changes I made, I felt it can be
substituted with the nohz_cpu_mask bitmap and hence I removed
it.
