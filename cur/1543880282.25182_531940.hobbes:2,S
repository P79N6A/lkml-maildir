[ i've Cc:-ed Ulrich Drepper, this CFS-triggered hang seems to have some 
  futex and pthread_cond_wait() relevance. ]

update: i've reproduced one kind of a hang but i'm not sure it's the 
same hang Ismail is seeing. It was quite hard to trigger it under CFS, i 
had to do wild forward/backward button seeks on a real DVD and i mixed 
it with CPU-intense workloads on the same box. Here are the straces and 
gdb backtraces:

what's weird is that all threads are in a pthread op and seem to be kind 
of busy-looping. Maybe xine-lib has some buggy use of pthread condvars 
that CFS happens to trigger? (If CFS broke futexes in general i think 
we'd be seeing far more widespread breakage.)
