If the memory bus speed doesn't change, can you do an uncached busywait on some
memory?
I don't know how practical this is on the x86, but on the PPC I turn off
rate-limiting for the duration of the udelay, and restore it when its done. 
This assumes that 1. you can switch it on and off quickly, and 2. that you
don't spend too much time in udelay.
It's ironic that busywaits like udelay are the only case where slowing down the
CPU gives you any power saving...
