What exactly is the problem with creating the userspace ABI in 
include/kabi/ and letting distributions do an
  cd /usr/include && ln -s kabi/* .
?
Or with creating the userspace ABI in include/kabi/ and letting 
distributions install the subdirs of include/kabi/ directly under 
/usr/include?
These are two doable approaches with a new kabi/ that avoid needless 
breaking of userspace.
