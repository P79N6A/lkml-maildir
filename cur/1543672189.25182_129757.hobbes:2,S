What you actually would do is have the LSM module turn exec into MAY_EXEC_IF
where the IF is done to match security context information to the binary being
execed. ssh shouldn't exec (well most of the time anyway) a root shell. 
Instead it should switch security context, (including a security id and 
uid's/gids) first, then exec if the new security context is valid for what is 
being execed. (and the new securid is not necessarily selected from kernel 
mode - it may depend on network connection + user id/gids requested + 
security level permitted)
More complicated, but the full security context being switched to cannot be
selected by the application itself.

true.
