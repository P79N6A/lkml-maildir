Thanks,
It will make merging the MANOS kernel happen faster.  My DLL prototypes
are using subsets
of Linux 2.2.16 for MANOS at present, and what I really need is for the
support issues to dovetail into a supported effort.  This one might fit
the bill.  I have no desire for TRG to support the 100's of LAN and disk
drivers all by our little lonesome in a divergent code base.
