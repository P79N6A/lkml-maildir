Hi,
2.5.68 is much smoother, quite less swap is used, my editors are not
pulled out of the swap all the time:
$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        515848     505804      10044          0      92808     173876
-/+ buffers/cache:     239120     276728
Swap:       524624      35612     489012
