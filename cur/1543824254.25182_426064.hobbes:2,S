The fact that lm_sensors disappeared could indeed be caused by this
patch if the system is based on one of the affected boards (which are
NOT only Asus board, despite of some comments in the code). I _did_
expect people to complain... There's nothing we can do for now though.
The error messages are definitely not related though. I suspect that
they were already there before, or this is just a coincidence.
What does the following command return?
cat /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-*/device/name
(Or even better "i2cdetect -l" if you have that installed.)
I'd guess that i2c-0, i2c-1 and i2c-2 are from either a framebuffer
driver or a tv card driver. Anything like that on this system? Probably
the eeprom driver (if you load it as I presume) is trying to probe
these busses and they don't want to be probed.
