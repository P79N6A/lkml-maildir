Speaking as someone who _does_ use a system for tracking patches, I
believe that patch management systems are a right pain in the arse.
If the quality of patches aren't good, then it throws you into a problem.
You have to provide people with a reason why you discarded their patch,
which provides people with the perfect opportunity to immediately start
bugging you about exactly how to make it better.  If you get lots of
such patches, eventually you've got a mailbox of people wanting to know
how to make their patches better.
I envy Alan, Linus, and Marcelo for having the ability to silently drop
patches and wait for resends.  I personally don't believe a patch tracking
system makes life any easier.  Yes, it means you can't loose patches, but
it means you can't accidentally loose them on purpose.  This, imho, makes
life very much harder.
I hope this makes some sort of sense 8)
