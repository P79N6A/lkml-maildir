Subject: kernel hangs at startup (immediately after decompress)

I've searched dejanews and found 9000 messages 'lilo hangs at LI', but
that's NOT my problem, I'm not that stupid to post this here. I also
tried the HOWTOs and FAQs, because I thought a lilo problem could only
be something that's in the FAQs. Wrong, didn't find anything.
My problem is on a Dual XEON 450MHz Siemens Primergy (670?) with Mylex
controller (patched 2.2 kernel), 1GB RAM (will be used for SAP R/3 on
Linux tests). Root partition 2 HDs RAID 1, rest (6) is RAID 5 and
doesn't matter at this point. There's a small extra, first partition
/boot.
Mylex-patched 2.2.2 (SMP) boots fine from floppy (created with dd
if=kernel of=/dev/fd0), but same kernel with lilo from disk is loaded,
Uncompressing kernel.... OK - and that's it, hang hang hang (after the
very first two lines of output after lilo).
A similar (a little smaller) system has no such problems.
