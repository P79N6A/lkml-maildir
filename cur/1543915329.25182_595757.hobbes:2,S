So currently there's nothing to prevent this:
				- write passes locks_mandatory_area() checks
	- get mandatory lock
	- read old data
				- write updates file data
	- read new data
You can see the data change even while you hold a mandatory lock that
should exclude writes.
Similarly you might think that an application could prevent anyone from
seeing the intermediate state of a file while it performs a series of
writes under an exclusive mandatory lock, but actually there's nothing
to stop a read in progress from racing with acquisition of the lock.
Unless I'm missing something, that makes our mandatory lock
implementation pretty pointless.  I wish we could either fix it or just
ditch it, but I suppose either option would be unpopular.
