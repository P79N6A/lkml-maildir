Some OSes use fcntl() F_FREESP/F_FREESP64 to be able to free allocated 
space in files (ie make holes if supported by underlying fs)
AFAIK, linux can generically do this only at the end of a file 
(ftruncate()) , not at random points.
XFS has special support for FREESP (it comes from IRIX), implemented as 
an ioctl()
Check for XFS_IOC_FREESP and XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP in fs/xfs/xfs_fs.h
