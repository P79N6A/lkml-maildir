It's easy to suggest a sysfs attribute.  What you've failed to do is
suggest the pathname of the sysfs attribute, the contents of it, or the
semantics of it (read-only?  read-write?  write-only?  blocking?)
My personal favourite would be to add a new verb to /proc/scsi/scsi, but
James dislikes that idea.
I'd *really* like to hear from distro people.  What is the most
convenient way for you to implement "load all the scsi modules, then
wait until all devices are found"?  James and I had thought that loading
a new module would be the easiest way for you, but it seems inconvenient
for you.
