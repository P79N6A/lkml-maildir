Or come up with a way to export some interface to userspace.
Or make a standard description format in something like XML that can be
used for arbitrary files and have userspace interface with that metadata
stream that is the XML.
This is, however, dangerously close to what we have now and does. not. work,
so the only added bonus we might have is the fact that it's endorsed by the
kernel.
I don't like this idea except as a last fallback solution...

Linux does not need to be screwed up by that.
It can be done right.

They also make perfect sense to me, and I would like this to have

So what do you do if you use someone else's system and he doesn't have
Arabic man pages but you want them in Arabic?
And a description that doesn't make sense in many years is badly formed.

Sure, but they store it differently in different places. Having them in
the actual file makes it universal.
I think the biggest issue is that you are arguing against this out of
some principle. There is a certain want for these new features among
the users, there are people who are willing to implement them, there
is Linus who seems to agree and accept.
What do you, and people who agree with you, lose if this gets implemented?
Drive space when you have the slightly-grown kernel sources downloaded?
