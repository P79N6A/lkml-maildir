As Dave suggested, I think there is too much other code that depends on
these atomics to be barriers for us to change it (at least not in this
patch! :)).

I guess your vmscan.c hunks are slightly nicer, though I might put
'cannot_free' right at the end, because it will be a very uncommon case.
And no, I don't have a test case. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if
nobody anywhere has ever hit it :) I was just browsing code...
