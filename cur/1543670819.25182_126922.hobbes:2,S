Linus - following are 6 patches against 2.5.68-bk3 to clean up the
remaining uses if '#if CONFIG*' in the source tree.  After these 6
patches, there are still remaining uses, but all are of the form
  #if CONFIG_VAR > VALUE
and it looks like the majority of them are "safe" in that the usage
is protected by some other #ifdef, and the corresponding Kconfig
assigns a default value.
