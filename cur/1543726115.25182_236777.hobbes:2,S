Neither the behaviour I'm seeing on my SuSE 8.2 box, and the code I see
in some random procps-3.2.1 I happened to have laying around, agree with
your description.
Rather, both behaviour and code have the 'e' option as a BSD option
(applicable if no '-' option flag) requesting that the environment be
shown, and I get the environment so shown, regardless of whether the
output is a pipe or a tty.
... This subthread is of course off-topic to Rob Landley's
original post - he wasn't using the 'e' option.
