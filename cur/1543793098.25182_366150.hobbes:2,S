Ok.  I've reviewed the usage of the memory model selectors in the
architectures in 2.6.14-mm2.  It appears that only i386 is affected by
this change, the others that use the selector have explicit enablement
of FLATMEM.  This patch will interact badly with the current code to
enable SPARSEMEM on non-numa systems.  However, this code is under
review at this moment, and the proposed replacement (Message-ID:
<4370BC30.40100@shadowen.org>) is compatible with this change.
In short as long as they go in together this change looks good.
Magnus, any feedback on the replacement SPARSEMEM enabler on non-NUMA
i386 systems??
