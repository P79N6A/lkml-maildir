I've tested on dash, that is `sh'. Everybody is welcome to test on his
favorite `/bin/sh' compatible shell.
It's very unclear from bash man page, where are extentions, and where are
common features. That particular script is small and non-bash oriented,
unlike gen_initramfs_list.sh [s/sh/bash].
Thus it's OK, even in scope of SUSv3 "incompatible" "%ul" in `printf'
(see my other reply on that).
