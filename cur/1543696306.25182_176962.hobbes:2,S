No problem. After all, you're the first one to answer, too ;)

OK, I'll write a unified driver then. Just one more question. Any reason
to prefer direct I/O access (ELV/Velleman) over parallel-port-style
programming (i2c-philips-par)? I'd say that the second is preferable,
but you might have had a reason to use direct access, that I ignore. If
not, I'll somehow use i2c-philips-par as a base for my unified driver,
which I'll probably call i2c-parport (since it won't be Philips-specific
anymore). That driver would support Philips adapters, ELV, Velleman and
ADM evaluation boards (I have one here for testing).
Thanks a lot for spending some time replying.
