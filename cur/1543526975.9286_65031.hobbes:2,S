	I know my manager runs with an open 'root' account (no password) because root has no special caps on his system.  It's sorta like a 
guest signon.  On our capability based machines, UID=0 means no more than
UID=34567.  Imagine the poor hacker who hacks the root account only to
discover he has less privilege than a normal user....:-)  Neat concept!
