Thats exactly the problem we described earlier in the ktimer discussion:
Changing HZ from 100 to 1000 while keeping the primary wheel size
unchanged caused increased cascading load.
HZ     CONFIG_BASE_SMALL=n     CONFIG_BASE_SMALL=y
 100    2560 ms                 640 ms
 250    1024 ms                 256 ms
 1000    256 ms                  64 ms
A lot of timeouts are in the range of 500ms. While the HZ=100 and HZ=250
settings keep them in the primary wheel either until expiry or early
removal, HZ=1000 and CONFIG_BASE_SMALL with HZ > 100 make cascading more
likely when the system load goes up.
Thats hard to balance for sure.
