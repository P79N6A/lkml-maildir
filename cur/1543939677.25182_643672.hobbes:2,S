Exactly right to some extent, but don't forget the underlying data=ordered 
starvation problem, which looks like a genuinely deep problem maybe related 
to blockIO.

See the 'konqueror deadlocks in 2.6.22' thread.

8M-record insert into indexed db-table:
         ordered  writeback
sqlite3:  75m22s    8m45s
mysql4 :  23m35s    5m29s

I hope so, but even with a fix available addressing the data=ordered 
starvation issue, this tunable could remain useful for those apps that 
misbehave.
Thanks!
