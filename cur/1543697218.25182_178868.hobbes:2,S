These two symbols not exported on sparc made my life (well, my evening
anyway) hell (well... long anyway). I couldn't load a bunch of modules, like
sunrpc and ipv6 until I added them.
Note that these two lines are probably in the wrong place in the file.
Bleh, my mailclient is doing evil things to the patch, but it's only two
lines, so it should be clear.
Also, I wonder what the status is for keyboard, mouse and framebuffer is for
2.6.0 on sparc. None of them seem to work right now.
