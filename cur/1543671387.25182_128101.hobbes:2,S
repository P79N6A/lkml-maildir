Please, this part I definitely want cleaned up.

This in particular is just too ugly for words. Why can't you just have a
	static const char *intel_nops[] = {
		NULL,
		INOP1, INOP2, INOP3, INOP4, INOP5, INOP6, INOP7, INOP8
	};
	static const char *k7_nops[] = {
		NULL,
		K7NOP1, K7NOP2, ...
	}
	....
	/*
	 * This will be overridden at boot once we find out what kind of 
	 * CPU we actually have
	 */
	static char **nops = intel_nops;
and then just use
	.. nops[size] ..
when you want a nop of size "size".
