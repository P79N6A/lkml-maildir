Well, if you want to go through all of swapfile.c, changing it over
to use pointers rather than type/indexes.  But I don't think it's
worth it, and I don't think it should be mixed in with this fix.

And that check, also Martin's I believe, has very good justification:
it will vary from arch to arch how big a swap area they can handle, and
his check is the right way to do it - no more obscure than it has to be.
