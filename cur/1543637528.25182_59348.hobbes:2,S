*I* said that, and it should be noted that it was completely obvious
from context that it was tongue in cheek:

(Get it?  The obvious, "newbie" question is answered by the experts in
a dozen different ways.  HAW HAW.)
Anyway, I hope you realized that.

Is "semantic rape" supposed to be good or bad?
The name "inode" (or i-node or I-node or eye-node---haw haw) doesn't
have to mean anything as long as it's conveniently short and
immediately evocative to people who use the name.  On its face,
calling something a "widget" isn't very descriptive either, yet its
meaning is obvious enough in the context of GUI programming.  See also
the Linux kernel's "dentry" and "skbuff".
People don't invent these shared languages to alienate newcomers.
They are invented to facilitate efficient communication and, just as
importantly, to encapsulate big, complicated ideas in tiny,
manipulable pretend-words.  They facilitate *thought* (and, so, the
design process) as much as they facilitate communciation.
That's good, right?

This has been explained by others, but let me note that the Jargon
File is an excellent resource for these types of questions:
        
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/
It doesn't include "inode" (which falls a little outside its scope),
but it has entries for "atomic", "foo", "bar", and "foobar".

By definition, "foo"s and "bar"s are ambiguous.  That's why they
should be used sparingly.  Typically they're used in little examples
of shell or C code where you need a *name*, but it's exact value and
meaning aren't important, like so:
>> Hey, there's a bug in the kernel!  Do "ln -s foo foo; mkdir foo"
>> and watch the fireworks.
They're rarely used to talk about new data structures except at the
earliest speculative design state.
