Subject: possible deadlock in smp_call_function()?

if the smp_function area is busy, then smp_call_function() executes the
following code:
>  if (retry) {
>         while (1) {
>                 if (smp_call_function_data) {
>                         schedule ();  /*  Give a mate a go  */
			  ^^^^^^^^^
>                         continue;
>                 }
>                 spin_lock (&lock);
>                 if (smp_call_function_data) {
>                         spin_unlock (&lock);  /*  Bad luck  */
>                         continue;
>                 }
>                 /*  Mine, all mine!  */
>                 break;
>          }
>  }
Is that ok?
e.g what if the current thread is a realtime thread, could this
deadlock? Is is possible that schedule() will never return?
I've written a small patch which enables _PAGE_GLOBAL for module memory,
but currently, the kernel locks hard during X startup.
