Please dont start a low level flamewar over this. Latency is firmly on the 
agenda and under consideration for the mainline kernel now. 
There is nothing wrong with using a dedicated alternative patchset for 
specific tasks, as long as any lessons learnt from it are also taken into 
consideration for mainline. Mainline kernels must have (high gain)/(low 
risk) ratio changes only. 
Rather than just saying that the desktop and multimedia is not considered it 
would be more helpful to say what helps where and why in the public forum of 
the main kernel mailing list. Off list discussion can go completely 
unnoticed (even I wasn't aware of my patchset being used and quoted!)
