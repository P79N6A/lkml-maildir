It does, thanks.
Would it make sense to enumerate these low-power states, rather than a bare
u32?
How, from the above message, is the driver to know that it's being asked
for a low-power state rather than an `off' state?   Via `state' I guess.
I can see that the kernel would have trouble asking a device to go into a
particular low-power state because of the variation in capabilities between
devices.  Perhaps the kernel should send the driver some higher-level piece
of information informing it what's going on, let the driver choose an
appropriate power state?
