When all drivers are safe, stopping user processes on ACPI S3 will no
longer be needed.
But they are not safe for now, and I believe that stopping processes
makes some hw drivers safe where they were not safe before. At least
if process is sleeping within some driver, stopping user processes
will wait till it exits the driver. That should help for simple
devices.
