ok - that may need attention, but its also my misunderstanding of the 
rootpath field;
which describes only what it got from dhcp, I was looking for the 
cmd-line arg
to show up there also.  the 'complete' threw me.
Anyway, I passed it in via dhcp.conf, so I now get this, (and 
command-line override)
IP-Config: eth0 guessed nameserver address 192.168.42.1
IP-Config: eth0 complete (from 192.168.42.1):
 address: 192.168.42.100   broadcast: 192.168.42.255   netmask:

 gateway: 0.0.0.0          dns0     : 192.168.42.1     dns1   : 0.0.0.0
 rootserver: 192.168.42.1 rootpath: /nfshost/truck
eth0: state = 4
kinit: do_mounts
kinit: name_to_dev_t(/dev/nfs) = dev(0,255)
kinit: root_dev = dev(0,255)
nfsroot=/nfshost/truck overrides boot server bootpath /nfshost/truck

Ive added this, but havent yet seen its output :-/
