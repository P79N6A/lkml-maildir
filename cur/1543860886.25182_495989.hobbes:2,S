It could be.
Or it could be something completely different.
If the same kernel compiled with gcc 3.4.6 works fine, you might run 
into one of the mysterious problems with gcc 4.1.
It could also be hardware problems (e.g. try running memtest86 for a 
longer time).
Does the machine hang completely, or is any useful information like e.g. 
an oops available?
