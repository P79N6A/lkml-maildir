This is my guess as well. Though performance will likely drop when I make the 
noinline macro mean something. (This may be offset by figuring out a way to 
make likely() and unlikely() also have a meaningful effect in userspace).
This benchmark should be run on BE machines, but I'm still trying to figure 
out a way to open-code a *fast* and *reliable* version of cpu_to_le16.
Suggestions for the above bits will always be appreciated.

I don't see that 'take 6' has had too much changed from 'take 4', although I 
haven't do a full comparison.
