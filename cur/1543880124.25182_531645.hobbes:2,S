OK, i tested both plain -rc7 and -rc7 + CFSv2 with while 
sched_child_runs_first enabled/disabled.
I'm always using same video file and try to reproduce freeze with constantly 
pressing forward/backward buttons. With CFS 2-3 forward/backward attempt 
reproduces this behaviour. 
And here are the results.
Mainline still has no issues with both xine-lib/kaffeine and xine-ui 
(kaffeine-0.8.4, xine-lib-1.1.5 [both xcb enabled], xine-ui-0.99.4). I really 
try hard to reproduce the freeze, but i can't...
And CFSv2 still fails for both child_runs_first and parent_runs_first cases 
with same strace output (FUTEX_WAIT).
If you want me to test something else just ask please :) 
Cheers
