Mark has determined that this is not a regression but rather an 
already-existing problem, caused by invoking kexec from within an xterm 
window.  See

Of course, this means there's liable to be something wrong with the way
kexec interacts with uhci-hcd or the other drivers sharing the same 
IRQ.  Failure to call the shutdown() method could cause the problem.  
But I don't see why using an xterm should make any difference (unless 
the only device being used was a mouse, and it was not in use while X 
wasn't running).
