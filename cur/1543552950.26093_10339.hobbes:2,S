Unfortunately, it doesn't fix the thing. ->sync_page() is called when we
do not own the page lock and nfs_sync_page() uses page->mapping. Yes, we
check it before calling the bloody thing, but we don't own the lock.
Problem only for NFS, but I'm not sure what to do about it - the whole
point of ->sync_page() seems to be (if I understood Trond's intentions
right) in forcing the ->readpage() in progress.
Another place you've missed is in read_cache_page(). That one is easy - we've
just locked the page and we should just repeat the whole thing if it's out
of cache.
One more is in filemap_swapout() - dunno, I just shifted the check to
filemap_write_page().
One more: check in do_generic_file_read() for ->mapping->i_shared_mmap.
Fix: trivial.
The last one is in deactivate_page_nolock() - there we check the ->mapping
without pagecache_lock and without page lock. Hell knows whether it's a
bug or not. Rik?
Minimal patch (against -pre7) follows. It still leaves sync_page() problem
open - any suggestions on that one are very welcome. Other than that and
deactivate_page_nolock() we should be safe wrt. ->mapping. Please, apply -
after that we will be in sync. nfs_sync_page() is still a problem and if
somebody (Trond?) might tell WTF it is supposed to be...
