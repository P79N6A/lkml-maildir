Something tells me that fun patches are going to show up.

Try the patch below or something similar. This was done by memory,
without testing, for 2.5. The equivalent for 2.4 would be even
simpler.
Actually, this should not work yet, the real trick would be to
generate the .o files from .c *and* the .i, so the linker stage will
find correct .o files and keep running.
In case you want to do allyesconfig, you will several hours fixing
compile problems. The resulting .config after doing all that is on my
system, you can have it if you want it.

Not all Makefiles, just one. :)
