> 1) There is a link in /lib/modules/2.4.0.11: build->/usr/src/linuxcreated by the Makefile (make modules_install). What for?
Many people limit their e-mail messages to 80 columns.  What for?
The 'build' symlink is to make it easier for external module
installation scripts to find the build directory for a given kernel.
This build directory, in turn, will yield the correct header files,
correct .config, correct compiler flags, etc., all of which can be
important for building a working module.
