You think it's worth supporting futexes on non-linear mappings?
I see your point of view; they could be useful.
In that case, the (vma & VM_SHARED) case needs to look up the correct
pgoff or page after all.
It might be worth a VM_NONLINEAR flag, to skip walking the page table
in the non-linear case, but that's just an optimisation.
