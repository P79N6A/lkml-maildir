Hello!
OK. I've solved my problems with storing data (problem was with improper DS 
setup - thanks to all, pointed me to this). And now I should perform a search 
in the BIOS are for particular string (version of BIOS ). Here is my code 
(it's located in the setup.S, so executes in the real mode, not ptotected).
-->
start_of_setup:
	jmp cl_start
cl_id_str:      .string "BIOS 0.1" 
cl_start:
        movb    $0, %al
        movw    $0xe000, %bx
cl_compare:
        incw    %bx
        movw    %bx, %si
        cmpw    $0xefff, %si
        je      cl_compare_done
        movw    $cl_id_str, %di
cl_compare_inner:
        movb    (%di), %ah
        cmpb    $0, %ah
        je      cl_compare_done_good
        cmpb    (%si), %ah
        jne     cl_compare
        incw    %si
        incw    %di
        jmp     cl_compare_inner
cl_compare_done_good:
        movb    $1, %al
cl_compare_done:
<--
This code don't work... I'm sure, that's because of inproper registers setup 
(or maybe address range is wrong). Please help me.
Best regards,
Andrew.
