I am using slackware (8.0), and the shutdown script on my system uses:
# Turn off swap, then unmount local file systems.
echo "Turning off swap."
swapoff -a
echo "Unmounting local file systems."
# Don't remount UMSDOS root volumes:
if [ ! "`mount | head -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 5`" = "umsdos" ]; then
  umount -a -r -t nonfs
  echo "Remounting root filesystem read-only."
  mount -n -o remount,ro /
else
  umount -a -r -t nonfs,noumsdos,nosmbfs
fi
# This never hurts:
sync
---
I guess that's not the probem, then... Actually, whenever I shutdown I never 
see any messages about the unmounting (or the mounting in readonly mode) 
failing, which only adds to my confusion.

Yes, that's the warning I see.

Does it? I know next to nothing about these issues, but I thought that I had 
read somewhere that log replays only occurred after a system crashed and 
couldn't be shutdown properly.
Thank you both,
