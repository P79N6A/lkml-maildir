Hi!
A bug in videodev.c lets you mmap device memory and free it
via close() - this leaves you with a nice "Blanko" mapping
of some memory. For example the bttv driver is vulnerable
as it frees its buffer in close(). (The drivers itself
cannot fix it, since they dont get the vm_area_struct)
Richard.
PS: patch is against 2.2.3-pre1
