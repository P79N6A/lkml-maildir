yes exactly, only the bootdrive LUN is registered after bootup. I have
to selectively scsiadd the other LUNs if there is a gap between the 
boot LUN (1-8 in our setup) and the shared storages (9-14). I don't
consider this a bug though, I had to remove some devices otherwise, 
and old drivers had to be patched to allow this at all.

It does, thanks for the hint :-)
I see this is in rc7 too.

it does not list the non-registered LUNs the driver knows about, as the
old proc interface did.
