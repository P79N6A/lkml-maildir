The specifications _are_ the laws conformant hardwares and softwares shall
follow, and nothing else. People that use them as toilet paper are not
doing the right thing, in my opinion. ;-)

The piece of software that inspects the device status registers (or
memory) that tell about things to do must not care about the reason for
which it has been called, and must do proper things to synchronyze
correctly with the device, since INTERRUPTS ARE NOT SYNCHRONISATIONS
EVENTS in PCI.

NOT A SYNCHRONISATION EVENT as I wrote.

Donnot know what a PYROSYNCHROGEM is, but the prefix PYRO may let think
you wanted to flame somebody. ;-)
Indeed a software based in "fast enough" sorts of considerations is way
broken and is just race-based. It must base its behaviour on ordering
rules.
The order in which the PCI controller deals with data and raises the
interrupt, and the way both the PCI device and the C code access shared
memory or IO registers makes a GREAT difference, especially when posted
transactions are used. 
Obviously, the PCI device must make available the data to the CPU prior
to raising the interrupt. But both the PCI device and the C code must
behave correctly in order not to stall and not to see inconsistent data.
