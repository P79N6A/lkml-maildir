Changelog diff between 2.6.5-rc3-aa1 and 2.6.5-rc3-aa2:
Only in 2.6.5-rc3-aa2: aic7xxx-suspend
	Fix aic7xxx swap suspend (from Pavel).
Files 2.6.5-rc3-aa1/anon-vma.gz and 2.6.5-rc3-aa2/anon-vma.gz differ
	Added hardness check for PageCompound in rw_swap_page_sync
	(it's a slow path and decoding the asm once is more than enough ;).
Only in 2.6.5-rc3-aa2: disable-cap-mlock
	Andrew's version of the original disable-cap-mlock implemented
	by Ken Chen. Long term userspace should learn to drop all
	capabilities but CAP_IPC_LOCK as Andrew suggested.
Files 2.6.5-rc3-aa1/extraversion and 2.6.5-rc3-aa2/extraversion differ
	Rediffed.
Only in 2.6.5-rc3-aa2: gfp-no-compound
	By default always generate compound pages for order > 0, and give the
	ability to drivers to allocate non-compound-multipages with
	__GFP_NO_COMP, and last but not the least always initialize
	all the page->counts if compound isn't selected. This also
	fixes the collision on page->private of swap-suspend and anon-vma.
	Swapsuspend now works.
Files 2.6.5-rc3-aa1/prio-tree.gz and 2.6.5-rc3-aa2/prio-tree.gz differ
	Added EXPORT_SYMBOL for prev/next prio-tree operations needed
	by xfs dmapi (not in this tree though).
Files 2.6.5-rc3-aa1/tag-writeback-pages-fix.patch.gz and 2.6.5-rc3-aa2/tag-writeback-pages-fix.patch.gz differ
	Fix -mm writeback crashes on rw_swap_page_sync.
