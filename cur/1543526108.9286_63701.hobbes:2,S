   No.
   On a real operating system, the OS would simply notify userland, which
   would do whatever it wanted to do.    A sensible userland might then
   spit out a dialog telling the user to put the disk in question back into
   the machine, or it might ignore the frantic request from the kernel,
   at which point the OS would return EYOULOSE to the poor process that 
   tried to access the no longer existing process.
   Think about kerneld/kmod/whatever it is this week.
