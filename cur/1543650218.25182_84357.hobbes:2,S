Perhaps what is really needed is a memory hierarchy in /proc (or elsewhere)
that enumerates its associated processors:
/proc/mem/
         /node0..n
               /main   => processors: 0 1 2 3
               /cache/
                      cache0 => processors: 0 2
                      cache1 => processors: 1 2
As I understand, many times ypu want to put a process in some processor
based on its sharing (or independence) of some memory level (numa local
preference, or hyperthreading)...
