That's OK - they should all do set_current_state() before sleeping.  It's
the bare schedule() without previously setting TASK_foo which is the
problem.  We used to do that sort of thing in 2.4 as a lame yield point but
we really shouldn't be doing that at all anywhere any more.

current always points at the current process.  In the situation
ptrace->access_process_vm->get_user_pages->pagefault we'll have mm !=
current->mm.
