I'll look into it. I find DocBook very verbose to write in at the moment
and much prefer LaTeX but I'm guessing I won't have a lot of choice in the
matter when I release the rest of the documentation if anyone else is
going to build on it.

In this case, it was deliberate. I didn't want shrink_cache to be
advertised on the kernel-doc because it's not a function people outside of
vmscan.c should be calling so did not see the point in having it picked
up.
