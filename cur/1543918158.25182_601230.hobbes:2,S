Subject: [PATCH] Fix SH DMA API so it works with PVR cascade
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch - hope it is not too late for 2.6.24 queue - gets the SH DMA
API to work properly for the PVR2 DMA cascade.
Currently the comment suggests that dar should not be set for the write
DMA but the API forces a set. This code fixes that. Furthermore there is
no read on the PVR2 CASCADE DMA (at least for the PVR) so that code is
removed.
