John Cherry has been running 'make buildcheck' regularly,
but apparently nobody has been looking.
Latest (2.6.9-rc4) is here:
http://developer.osdl.org/cherry/compile/2.6/linux-2.6.9-rc4.results/2.6.9-rc4.reference_init26.bzImage.txt
My experience with output of buildcheck is that it's verbose and has
lots of false positives.  (Yes, I have used it and generated patches
from it.)  First thing I do is delete all lines that match
"data.*init" or "data.*exit".  These are (usually -- famous word) OK.
Then someone can look at the entries that really need to be checked,
such as this list, derived from the larger list above:
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/doc/2.6.9-rc4.reference_init26.bzImage.txt
I'll look over it in the next few days.
