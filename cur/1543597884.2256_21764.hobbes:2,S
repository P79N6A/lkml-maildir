Face it, unsigned long *is* the correct data type. The API has been
specified like this for years, no reason to change it. long us
guaranteed to be able to hold a pointer on Linux, ie. the largest
natural data type.
And no, you are more likely to find a 32 bit size_t on some systems and
we do not need yet another obscure data type flags_t when unsigned long
does the job fine as it is.
