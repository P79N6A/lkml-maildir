Well...
After Linus saying that the real creators of Linux are "the Tooth Fairy and
Santa Claus" ( 
http://www.linuxworld.com/story/44851.htm
 ), Andy Tanenbaum
wrote Some Notes on the "Who wrote Linux" Kerfuffle
( 
http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/
 ) and today made a follow-up
(
http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/followup/
 ) telling what were the motivations
of Ken Brown, President of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution.
Interesting readings...
Anyway, I think this is kind of an off-topic theme for this Mailing List.
