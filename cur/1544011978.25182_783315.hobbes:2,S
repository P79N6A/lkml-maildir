Precedence: bulk

Hi,
This is version 5 of dmaengine and framebuffer drivers for i.MX31.
Changes since version 4: addressed comments from Sascha Hauer, apart from: 
the idmac driver still uses two locks - a mutex and a spinlock, the "ugly" 
construction like "to_ipu(to_idmac(ichan->dma_chan.device));" is still 
there, still all 144 IRQs are registered. So now the driver is under 
drivers/dma, also fixed all docbook comments.
Changes since version 3: fixed idmac_issue_pending() to not reset the 
current buffer, fixed return value from idmac_tx_submit(), fixed 
framebuffer panning.
Changes since version 2: now uses a tasklet to clean up completed 
transaction descriptors, as suggested by Dan Williams.
Changes since version 1: rebased on the updated dmaengine framework.
Aimed at 2.6.29.
Based on linux-next as of commit f0e0e8954d03b414927650a6129ace01d554afdc.
Thanks
Guennadi
