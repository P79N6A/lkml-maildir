hmm, at least now I know where that strange sound comes from.
I'm not quite sure that SpeedStep does not work,
with SpeedStep disabled in the BIOS the fans turned on again with
cpu load. this doesn't happen with SpeedStep. so I suppose it works
to some extent, right?
> noise, so linux need not.
so what options should I set?
as I've already stated it's not bearable to do coding (incl. compiling)
on this box without "Battery Optimized Mode" as SpeedStep calls it.
on Linux I did that with a simple tool called speedstep.
I've seen autospeedstep from Fritz Ganter which seems to use ACPI,
dunno how that compares to cpufreqd.
anyway, this laptop is not-so-nice anyway, I'm just happy I didn't
buy it but my employer did ;)
