Huh.  Well, I have a 3CCFE575BT "3c575" card and I have
had success using the 3c59x driver to enable the card.
I only have one bug I am tracking:
If I have two cardbus cards active in my cardbus slots,
the 3c59x driver locks up.  I doubt this problem would
vanish if I were using your 3c575 driver, but I will give
it a try.
There's one other annoyance:
The config files for pcmcia-cs expect the 3c575_cb driver,
so I either have to hack the configuration files or load
the 3c59x driver by hand.
In case it isn't clear, I am only using the PCMCIA/Cardbus
drivers from the 2.4.0 kernel tree (yenta and friends).
I am only using pcmcia-cs utilities and configuration files
for PCMCIA support and to give me a decent /etc/pcmcia/config.opts
file.
