Oh I realise it doesn't work with current implementations (powerpc at
least also would be broken I think). And I've always assumed no... But
the question was just whether the Linux memory model requires it (it
theoretically could require that smp_rmb is sequentially ordered WRT
smp_wmb without actually sequentially ordering stores around itself).

OK, good to hear it has been discussed. I didn't see anything explicit
in the documentation about it.  A lot of the literature often says that
"barrier instructions" have a sequential ordering, so it could be useful
to explicitly say this isn't the case for Linux for rmb vs wmb.
