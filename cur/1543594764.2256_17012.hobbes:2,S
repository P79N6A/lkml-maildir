System-design and elegance are easy to get
in Java, and in fact are independent of language.  Good c code will beat
Java in most cases, performance wise, but lately the difference has become
small enough not to matter for most applications.  Speed is not the most
important feature in a great many programs, otherwise we'd all be using
assembly still.

When was the last time you wrote a large cross-platform GUI that just
worked on other platforms, without any additional tweaking, after you
developed it on your Linux machine?
