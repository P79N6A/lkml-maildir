I found the culprit: CPU hotplug.  The problem is that 
prefill_possible_map() is called after setup_per_cpu_areas().  This 
leaves the per-cpu data sections for the future cpus uninitialized 
(still pointing to the original per-cpu data, which is initmem).  Since 
the cpus exists in cpu_possible_map, for_each_cpu will iterate over them 
even though the per-cpu data is invalid.
