Avoiding the kernel-side PCMCIA-stuff and using the standalone package
got me a lot further. After a few tweaks int he config files I get the
interface up and things startes to happen:
lapper root # ifconfig eth1
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:09:5B:27:DC:F9

Some things may be broken...

Seems I need to get the wireless tools rebuilt and I'll be in touch
with a WLAN in a few hours, but this all seems swell now.
After inserting the card (NetGear MA401) I get this in my log tho:

If you have an idea about the errors, drop me a line, and if not I'll
dig into it :)
