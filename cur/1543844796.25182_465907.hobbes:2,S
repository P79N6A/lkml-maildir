Thank you all very much for your reviews!
In this particular case, I chose the American spelling because it 
existed too in the same file (see 
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/DocBook/kernel-hacking.tmpl#1098
). 
I guess it is fine to have 2 different spellings for the same word in 
the same document, right? Otherwise, arbitrating between the 2 options 
can be pretty tricky.
