Apparently that's still too much knowledge ;)
Or, in other words: 6 reboots already and not a single problem!
So yes, the removal of the NULLing line in this patch most likely
has caused this issue on my box.
Now the question is whether something as simple as that is a fully
correct fix or whether something should be done entirely differently.
I'll let people more familiar with those parts decide about it...
Thanks!
