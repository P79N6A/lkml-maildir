  Presumably something like this patch?
  I've had problems with PCMCIA since (after) 2.1.124 or so filling
up its Rx/TX queues and hanging up networking.  Anyone else?  2.1.124 is
a little rough and there was a fairly major kernel change that required
a lot of PCMCIA fixes.  Certainly hasn't been happy since then.
  For *low* traffic PCMCIA ethernet traffic, no problem.  Try doing a
big scp (ssh secure copy) over even a half-duplex 10MB network and it
will choke pretty quickly most of the time.  Doing a FTP or whatever
out to the internet over ISDN speeds won't tickle it.
