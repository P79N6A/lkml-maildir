Hi,
d_delete() doesn't appear to ever create negative dentries when
called via vfs_unlink() due to the extra reference on the dentry.
In fact, a printk() in the d_delete() spot never ever triggers...
This could explain the behavior change, wherein rm -r on a large
directory no longer works in ramfs/tmpfs, because the dentries are
now destroyed instead of going negative. [1]  Is it intentional
that no negative dentries are created via vfs_unlink() method?

1. if that's true, memory pressure could make readdir fail too.
