Yo All!
I just tried to compile SMBFS in test12-pre8.  Here is the error
message I get:
make[3]: Entering directory `/u3/local/src/linux-2.4.0-test12-pre8/fs/smbfs'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/local/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686  -DSMBFS_PARANOIA  -c -o sock.o sock.c
sock.c: In function `smb_data_ready':
sock.c:166: structure has no member named `next'
make[3]: *** [sock.o] Error 1
This has worked in the recent past.
This is the failing line 166 in fs/smbfs/sock.c:
	job->cb.next = NULL;
It looks like tq_struct has been changed so that the tq_struct->next
member is now tq_struct->list.next.
So can we just delete line 166 in fs/smbfs/sock.c?
Or do we still need to initialize next by changing line 166 to:
	 job->cb.list.next = NULL.
Ideas?
