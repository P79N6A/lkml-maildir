It is problems like this that worry me.  Wouldn't this cause silent data
corruption?  My stat() test just shows the window is small but there.
Of course, I would also prefer that stat() always gives the right
answer.  Taking i_sem in sys_stat() would add more overhead to
sys_stat() and it would write the inode cache line.
The overhead on reading i_size is an extra 4-bytes and and 2 rmb()s
and this in only on preempt or SMP.  Also, i_size_read() only reads
the inode fields, so on SMP it does not bounce the cache lines around.
The overhead on the write side is very small with just the updates to
the sequence value.
I ran some bonnie++ tests on 2-proc machines and did not notice any
difference between 2.5.68 and 2.5.68-isize.
The i_size patch fixes the file systems that use the generic interfaces
and added i_size_write()s for ext3.  I wanted to get these changes in
before checking and fixing all the other file systems.
I'll see if I can think up a test to see the problem shows up somewhere
besides sys_stat.  Any ideas?
Any ideas on tests to run to measure the overhead of this patch?
Thanks,
