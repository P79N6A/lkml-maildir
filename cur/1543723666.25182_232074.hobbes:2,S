this is only about terminal settings like flags  and line speed, it is not
related to presenting the login on the serial console. It is a good idea to
remove this file and set the baud rate on the boot command line.
You must configure /sbin/sulogin which is called from init to run on
/dev/console, then you will be fine. Also you should start a getty on
/dev/ttySx for multi user modes (see the serial console howto)
