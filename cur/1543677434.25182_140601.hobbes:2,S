Subject: [PATCH] fix weird kmalloc bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Last night, Manfred and I found an interesting bug with kmalloc on
ppc32, where the kmalloc in alloc_super() (fs/super.c) was requesting
432 bytes but only getting 256 bytes.  The reason was that PAGE_SIZE
wasn't defined at the point where the kmalloc() inline function
occurs.  Thus the CACHE(32) entry got omitted from the list in
kmalloc_sizes.h, and kmalloc therefore used the entry in
malloc_sizes[] before the correct entry.
This patch fixes it by including asm/page.h and asm/cache.h in
linux/slab.h.  The list in kmalloc_sizes.h depends on L1_CACHE_BYTES
as well as PAGE_SIZE, which is why I added asm/cache.h.
Paul.
