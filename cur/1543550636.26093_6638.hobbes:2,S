Let me try this and find out...
Hmm. I get an error when trying to run 'make xconfig':
gmake[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.0-test9/scripts'               
cat header.tk >> ./kconfig.tk                                                   
./tkparse < ../arch/sparc/config.in >> kconfig.tk                               
-: 97: unknown command                                                          
gmake[1]: *** [kconfig.tk] Error 1

...Ok...Making boot...
Damn. A good 2 hours later and it looks as though the compile exited
cleanly :) yaaay! 
The answer to your question is yes, the fix Linus put in today fixed the
problem :)
Talk to you later,
