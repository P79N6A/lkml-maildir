Can sockets be "labeled". Like creating a label for each process, and then 
apply a label to each socket they open. If a socket gets shared, then it gets 
multiple labels.
I see that you talk about SELinux labels below, but is there a way to "label" 
anything without using SELinux? (Maybe by writing another LSM module that 
does just this socket labeling?)
I could then just check the labels to see if a packet is allowed to pass/ or 
not.

Could you tell me on which thread/mailing list this discussion/(work in 
progress) is taking place? I'd like to follow it.
Thanks
