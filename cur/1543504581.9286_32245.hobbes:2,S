Subject: PATCH for 2.3.12: swap-related deadlock

Linus:
Two things: a patch and a question.
First, if there is no swap space available, "try_to_swap_out()" can
exit without unlocking the "page_table_lock" spinlock.  I tickled this
bug during a boot-time "fsck" before swap space had been added.
The following patch (against 2.3.12) fixes this problem:
--- linux-2.3.12/mm/vmscan.c	Sun Aug  1 19:01:42 1999
+++ linux-2.3.12-mine/mm/vmscan.c	Sun Aug  1 22:42:03 1999

+		goto out_failed_unlock; /* No swap space left */
		
	vma->vm_mm->rss--;
	tsk->nswap++;
Second, I originally observed (and debugged) this problem under
2.3.11.  When I'd applied the above patch to 2.3.11, the hangs were
replaced by reboots.  I narrowed it down to a change in "fs/buffer.c"
introduced in 2.3.11 to switch "bdflush" to a "lazy TLB mode".
Backing out the change stopped the reboots.
I hypothesized a race condition: to enter lazy TLB mode, the
"sys_bdflush()" function set "current->mm" to NULL.  If this happened
immediately after "swap_out()" had checked its validity, then
"swap_out()"'s helper functions would dereference a NULL pointer.
Since "swap_out()" was running with the kernel lock held, I added a
"lock_kernel()/unlock_kernel()" pair around the "current->mm = NULL"
statement, and that stopped the reboots.
However, I wasn't able to duplicate the reboot problem under 2.3.12,
so perhaps my hypothesis was incorrect.
What is the purpose of "task->active_mm" versus "task->mm"?  Should
"start_lazy_tlb()" perform "current->mm = NULL" while holding the
kernel lock?  Or should "swap_out()" and its helper functions be
looking at "tsk->active_mm" instead of "tsk->mm"?
Thanks.
