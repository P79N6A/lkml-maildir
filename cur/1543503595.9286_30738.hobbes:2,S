Yes, that _has_ happened!...recently I wrote
a program to tickle it harder...a a large number of
threads (e.g. 50) in tight loops hitting a mutexs.
Completelly craps out on SMP. This is still
a module in my program, probably the next step
is to write the 10 line proggy that exhibits this.
I don't believe you can code around it. It's a race
I bet and if you have a lot of mutex contention or
are just unluckly, wham.
