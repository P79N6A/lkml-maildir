That's correct.  It can't be mapped.  It's a private mapping only used
for metadata.
I'm really not sure the code in question is having the intended effect.
Maybe one of the gurus on cc: can take a look at the code and tell me if
it's worth keeping.  I apologize in advance if it makes anyone lose
their lunch.

I'm not sure whether zero or PAGE_CACHE_SIZE would be better.  The
situation is where some page of metadata is no longer used, say
shrinking a directory tree or truncating a file and throwing out the
extent tree.
