let's do a few examples here, just to illustrate the
advantages and disadvantages of nsproxy as separate
structure over nsproxy as part of the task_struct
1) typical setup, 100 guests as shell servers, 5
   tasks each when unused, 10 tasks when used 10%
   used in average
   a) separate nsproxy, we need at least 100
      structs to handle that (saves some space)
      we might end up with ~500 nsproxies, if
      the shell clones a new namespace (so might
      not save that much space)
      we do a single inc/dec when the nsproxy
      is reused, but do the full N inc/dec when
      we have to copy an nsproxy (might save
      some refcounting)
      we need to do the indirection step, from
      task to nsproxy to space (and data)
   b) we have ~600 tasks with 600 times the
      nsproxy data (uses up some more space)
      we have to do the full N inc/dev when
      we create a new task (more refcounting)
      we do not need to do the indirection, we
      access spaces directly from the 'hot'
      task struct (makes hot pathes quite fast)
   so basically we trade a little more space and
   overhead on task creation for having no 
   indirection to the data accessed quite often
   throughout the tasks life (hopefully)
2) context migration: for whatever reason, we decide
   to migrate a task into a subset (space mix) of a
   context 1000 times
   a) separate nsproxy, we need to create a new one
      consisting of the 'new' mix, which will
      - allocate the nsproxy struct
      - inc refcounts to all copied spaces
      - inc refcount nsproxy and assign to task
      - dec refcount existing task nsproxy
      after task completion
      - dec nsproxy refcount
      - dec refcounts for all spaces      
      - free up nsproxy struct
   b) nsproxy data in task struct
      - inc/dec refcounts to changed spaces
      after task completion
      - dec refcounts to spaces
   so here we gain nothing with the nsproxy, unless
   the chosen subset is identical to the one already
   used, where we end up with a single refcount 
   instead of N

sure it is one to many, i.e. each task points to
exactly one context struct, while a context can
consist of zero, one or many tasks (no back- 
pointers there)
> Does task_struct store pointers to those objects directly?
it contains a single pointer to the context struct, 
and that contains (as a substruct) the accounting
and limit information
