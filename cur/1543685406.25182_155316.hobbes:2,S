You don't want to use DMA on your ATAPI devices?
If you want DMA on ATAPI and have PCI IDE chipset you need
"PCI IDE chipset support" + "Generic PCI bus-master DMA support"
+ driver for you chipset.

Yep. Proper fix is to make setup_pci.c independent of ide_dma.c (requires
some more thought and work).
