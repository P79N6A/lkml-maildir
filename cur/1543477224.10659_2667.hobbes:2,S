1. 'make bzImage' after a failed 'make zImage' (too big kernel) results
in full recompilation of everything.
This is annoying, though evidently doesn't take too much time on modern
hardware.
2. *Feeling* of multitasking is reduced to zero when one of the running
tasks performs disk access in such a way, that caching cannot make it
smooth. My example is building a set of index files for an obsolete
version of some database (not to blame its vendor). Random disk access
on a range of several hundreds
of megs. (RAM: 64M)
This situation under 2.2 seems to be better than under 2.0, but still
unpleasant.
It takes minutes to launch emacs during that time, not speaking about
netscape.
All other things seem to go smoothly. No problems with NFS and NTFS, to
mention a few of not them.
