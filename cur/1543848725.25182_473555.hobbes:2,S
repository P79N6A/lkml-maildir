So the answer is that -rc1-mm1 doesn't quite have the most recent
version of this patch.  Grab the final patch at the end of this post
from Andrew:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/11/234
It fixes up a misunderstanding that came from
generic_file_buffered_write()'s habit of adding its 'written' input into
the amount of bytes it announces having written in its return value.
From mm-commits it looks like -mm2 will have the full patch.
