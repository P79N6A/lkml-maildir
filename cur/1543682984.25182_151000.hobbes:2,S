I wretched horribly when I read that driver.  Then I started to renounce 
my computer ways to become a Tibetten Monk and live out the remainder of 
my days in peace and solice.  Unfortunately, about that time, a space 
thread passed another thread, opened up a short lived wormhole, and I 
got a futuristic glimpse of myself in a robe and bald and I immediately 
came back to my senses.  I still couldn't handle that driver code 
though.  The urge to fix massive brokenness other than just PCI DMA code 
issues was overwhelming to my right hand's obsessive/compulsive disorder.
However, as a hint to anyone out there, I fixed the other initio driver 
a long ways back.  A person could pull those 3 (I think) changesets from 
the kernel tree and see what I did.  If you ignore all the changes to 
eliminate the fixed array of hosts and that kind of crap, and just 
concentrate on the changes that involve the PCI DMA mapping, they should 
apply almost perfectly into this other initio driver as they are very 
close copies of each other.
