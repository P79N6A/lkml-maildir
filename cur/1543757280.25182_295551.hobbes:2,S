The kernel code is supposed to prevent module removal when it
is still in use. Have you discovered a bug where the kernel
will allow unloading when it's still being used???
There used to be MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT
macros to be using in open() and close(). However their
use has been depreciated in favor of some internal kernel
magic. So, unless you have discovered a bug, your code
doesn't have to worry anymore.
