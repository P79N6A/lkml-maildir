If we are going to create 1000 threads each second, then it is better to
preallocate them and queue a work to that pool - like syslets did with
syscalls, but not ulitimately create a new thread just because it is not 
that slow.
All such micro-thread designs are especially good in the case when 
1. switching is _rare_ (very)
2. programmer does not want to create complex model to achieve maximum
performance
Disk (cached) IO definitely hits first entry and second one is there for
advertisements and fast deployment, but overall usage of the
asynchronous IO model is not limited to the above scenario, so
micro-threads definitely hit own niche, but they can not cover all usage
cases.
