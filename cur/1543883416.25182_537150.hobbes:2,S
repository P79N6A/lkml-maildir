And what would you use instead?

Sure, but do you have alternatives?

So you want to do the work that should be done by a computer in
a database done by a human.  Does not sound particularly efficient.

You need a few people in bugzilla that ask the questions to narrow it
down (= bugmasters). e.g. the opensuse bugzilla works this way :- 
everything new gets assigned to a few screening people who 
ask some questions and then reassign to the right people.

An unmaintained bugzilla yes. A well maintained one would have someone
asking them the (often quite repetive questions) to narrow it down
to a subsystem or a driver. And then it could have been assigned.

There have been a couple of email thread trackers; like jitterbug -- 
in fact bugzilla can do that with an email interfaces. But in my experience 
they don't work well because a bug tracking system has slightly different
requirements than normal emails (e.g. it wants you to roughly
stay on topic for the current bug). With email people always
forget that and in the end you end up with lots of stuff in there
not related to the bug at all.
Also with distributed solutions it would be hard to get
a global "how many regressions do we really have right now" statistic,
which is fairly important.
The web interface is slow and ugly but at least it puts
the people in the right mind set for this unlike email.
And it gives you a central point to get an overview of the bugs.
Anyways I'm sure bugzilla could be improved, I just don't know
of anything better currently.
