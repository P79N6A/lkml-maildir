Okay, statement here seems to be "it is technically possible to write
BK2something using documented interfaces", problem is just that nobody
but Halle Berry is allowed to do the work. So Larry claims that he's
not doing lock-in because you can export that data. Only catch is that
you are not legally permitted to do that with free version, and Larry
is not going to sell commercial version to you if you do something
like this. So we have unique lockin at legal level, instead of
technical one.
If I misunderstood this, Larry please clarify.
