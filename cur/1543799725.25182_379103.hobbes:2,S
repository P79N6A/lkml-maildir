HI Doug,
Thank you for your quick reply.  There was no "address error" - the only
 thing on the serial console is what I posted.
In the past, this board, the CPUs, and these memory DIMMs have passed 24
continuous hours of memtest, but perhaps something has deteriorated in
the mean time.  I'll run memtest again to see if I can find a problem.
FYI:  This MB (MSI K8T Master2 FAR) has been problematic since day one.
 A BIOS upgrade improved stability, but I've never gotten more then 21
straight days of uptime on this machine (compared to 200-300 days on
several other machines in my house).  I've had *many* random hangs but
seldom does something get printed on the serial console.  When it does
hang, the serial console is unresponsive.
I'll be swapping out this MB in favor of a Tyan.  I've put up with it
long enough.  Assuming that the Tyan MB solves the problem, I won't be
purchasing any more MSI MBs (and neither will my friends if I have
anything to say about it).
Thanks again for the help!
Andy
