Because interactive tasks tend to spend very small timeslice at one
time, scaling timeslice for these tasks is not effective to control
CPU spent.
Or, do you say that lots of non-interactive tasks are misjudged as
TASK_INTERACTIVE(p)?

Yes. But these non-sleeping CPU-hog tasks tend to dominant CPU, so
it is worth controlling them.
