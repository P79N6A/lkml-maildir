     Yes.  This is a failure in the current implementation that would be
     corrected if it could be union-mounted onto a physical filesystem.

     How?

     Yes.

     No, it's not even close.

 - it makes the kernel device knowledge available to userspace.
 - no more /dev/root in /proc/mounts
 - you don't have to grovel through 17 different places to find out
   what known hardware is attached to the system.
 - allows you to run a Linux kernel on a filesystem that does not
   have Unix semantics.
>Also: It is extra code, has to be maintained and updated,
 Richard Gooch has been maintaining this code for over a year now, in
 the face of nonstop abuse from the ``It's not traditional, so it's
 icky!!!'' core team members.   I'd guess that his commitment to keeping
 the code working is better than 90% of the people here.

    david parsons \bi/ I'm sure that black magic is well and good, but I'd
                   \/                      rather have the kernel tell all.
