if speaking of recent 2.6...
CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_ACPI are independent.
So if you select CONFIG_SMP and don't select CONFIG_ACPI,
then your PC will need to support MPS if Linux is going to bring up the processors...
There no longer exists a build-time concept of "minimal part of ACPI that is needed" --
you either include CONFIG_ACPI or you exclude it.  However, at boot-time, "acpi=ht"
is still present -- primarily for some old systems with HT  that didn't run ACPI well.
No idea if this this is still needed in practice but occasionally acpi=ht comes in handy
to debug table related issues.
