Hi, well
he is using RAID card !
his 2.2.x promise hacked modules work fine, but I didn't install that old 
modules, it's not support SCSI emulator
well, if using 2.2.x hacked kernel, it can tell out that HD are SCSI HD ( 
sda0 ), but in 2.4.x, it's display ( hde ) and can not boot up to linux!
what's problem is it??
