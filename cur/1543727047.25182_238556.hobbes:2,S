Good point, I forgot about that.  Theoretically, as long as a device has been 
POSTed, vgacon should work just fine with some small tweaks on platforms that 
allow mapping of the VGA framebuffer.

Sounds good.  Cards usually POST pretty quickly, so that won't be a problem 
until someone puts 32 cards in a system (oh wait, that's not too far off :).

I personally don't care about anything but PCI, AGP and PCI-Express, but you 
make a good point about embedded stuff.

Yeah, that sounds reasonable.  I'd vote for a real device as opposed to sysfs 
files, for now at least.
