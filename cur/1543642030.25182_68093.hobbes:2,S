We've been through this before.  Last time, the winning solution was:
   printk("at least %lli of your u64s are belong to us\n", (long long) sect_num);
and I expect it will be this time too.  It's just a printk!  Who cares if it
wastes a few bytes.  It's even conceivable that if we use this idiom heavily
enough, some gcc boffin will take the time to optimize away the useless
conversions.
