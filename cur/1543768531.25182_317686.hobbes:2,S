Pretty sure.

Or good, depending on your point of view :)
Don't think of "namespaces".  Think "set of mounts".
Then what Linux does makes more sense.
Don't forget that if you couldn't do this, you could still use ptrace
to traverse the child's namespace by tracing it.

I'm not convinced the functionality is all that useful.  It doesn't
address the need which arose in this thread, which is roughly
equivalent to per-user namespaces (the precise meaning determined by
userspace policy).  So what applicatins is it useful for?  Do we have
examples, or is it just a nice idea?
