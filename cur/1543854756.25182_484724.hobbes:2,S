This is a power-off request, did someone push the power-off button
or give the power-off command from the System Controller console?
I should add proper support for this, this report is a good reminder
:-)
All resumable errors of type 0x4 are power-off requests.
Unfortunately these encodings are not in any of the publicly published
documents.
