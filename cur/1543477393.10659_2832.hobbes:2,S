You can find it as an gziped attachment ...
Here you can see, that CPU1 is frozen. In normal case the values of 
the respective interrupt counters are nearly equal ...
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      21752      16826    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        437        289    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:          2          0    IO-APIC-edge  soundblaster
 12:       1953        950    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
 13:          1          0          XT-PIC  fpu
 19:       7476       6747   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
NMI:          0
ERR:          0
Some seconds or minutes later you can see, that the the
timer interrupt for CPU0 "hangs", too. The other values are 
increased:
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      21752      16826    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        664        289    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:          2          0    IO-APIC-edge  soundblaster
 12:       1953        950    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
 13:          1          0          XT-PIC  fpu
 19:       7517       6747   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
NMI:          0
ERR:          0

The box said "Requires Win95, NT, or better," and so I installed Linux.
