Hi,
I'm sure this must be in some FAQ somewhere...
I've been having problems for a while now with setserial.
My PPP script looks something like this:
/bin/setserial /dev/modem spd_vhi
exec /usr/sbin/pppd /dev/modem 38400 \
        $LOCAL_IP:$REMOTE_IP \
        connect $DIALER_SCRIPT
And this generates the following kernel message:
Aug 22 10:24:48 skinner kernel: Use of setserial/setrocket to set
SPD_* flags is deprecated
Aug 22 10:24:49 skinner pppd[2904]: pppd 2.3.5 started by root, uid 0
Aug 22 10:24:49 skinner kernel: Use of setserial/setrocket to set
SPD_* flags is deprecated
Aug 22 10:25:16 skinner pppd[2904]: Serial connection established.
Aug 22 10:25:17 skinner pppd[2904]: Using interface ppp0
Aug 22 10:25:17 skinner pppd[2904]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/modem
Anyone any ideas?
(This has been happening for a while and I have been searching the web
but the only thing I found was someone else who had a similar problem)
If this is deprecated then what is the current way of setting the serial
port to 115kb?
