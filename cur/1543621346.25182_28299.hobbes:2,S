From a netfiler point of view I don't see any problems with your approach,
and in fact it seems cleaner to have a consistent behaviour with regard
to the id field.
But since the change is not inside the netfilter code, but in the core
networking, it's up to the core networking maintainers to decide if this
patch is acceptable or might break something.

Please always use unified diff - it's difficult to understand your patch
just from reading it since it doesn't contain context (diff -u)
