You don't seem to realise that this is a BUG (somewhere, could even be
in the generic mapping functions)! blk_rq_map_sg() must never map a
request to more entries that rq->nr_segments, that's just very wrong.
That's why I'm suspecting the recent pcidma changes. Just a feeling, I
have not looked at them.
