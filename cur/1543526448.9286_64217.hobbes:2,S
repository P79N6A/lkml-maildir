   At the very least, the sym53c8xx driver needs to be merged in from the
   vger CVS tree (I tried an older one from about four days ago and that
   did not work correctly either).
I am working constantly with Gerard to merge the PCI mapping
support into his driver.
Folks with have to be patient and wait for Gerard to finish
this work and submit to Linus before it is in his tree.
Later,
