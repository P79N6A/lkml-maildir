You still lack correct attribution -- see for example the first line of
my mail; it states when the message I'm quoting from was written, and by
whom.
This is exacerbated by your lack of correct references, which
artificially disconnects your mail from the mail to which you're
actually replying.
Also, why did you (appear to) say "No" in your own 'voice'? Surely that
should have been part of the quoted message?
Please use a non-toy mail program. This is real life, and real
communication -- not a game. Take it seriously, or take it elsewhere.
