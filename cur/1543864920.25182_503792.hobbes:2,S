I've test 2.6.20-rc7,
still messages that ordinary catch syslog-ng, also go
to console, unlike 2.6.18(my default kernel) and 2.6.20-rc4(or rc3).

When I booted last time with 2.6.20(as I remember -rc4),
I don't see this issue:
all kernel message instead of just
go to syslog-ng and then into /var/log/messages
also go to console.
