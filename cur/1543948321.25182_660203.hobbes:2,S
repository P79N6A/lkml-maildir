This should work. Untested for now. Can you give it a try ?
Fix Immediate Deadlock
Jason Baron <jbaron@redhat.com> :
In testing this patch, i've run across a deadlock...apply_imv_update() can get
called again before, ipi_busy_loop() has had a chance to finsh, and set
wait_sync back to its initial value. This causes ipi_busy_loop() to get stuck
indefinitely and the subsequent apply_imv_update() hangs. I've shown this
deadlock below using nmi_watchdog=1 in item 1).
Mathieu Desnoyers <mathieu.desnoyers@polymtl.ca> :
Hrm, yes, Jan pointed out the exact same problem in my ltt-test-tsc TSC
test module in LTTng a few days ago. His fix implied to add another
barrier upon which the smp_call_function() caller must wait for the ipis
to finish. Since this immediate value code does the same I did in my
ltt-test-tsc code, the same fix will likely apply.
Thanks to Jason Baron for finding this bug and proposing an initial
implementation.
