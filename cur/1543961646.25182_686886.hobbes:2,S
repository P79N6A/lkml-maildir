I just ssh'd into three embedded boards I have handy, and they have
respectively four, four, and seven entries there.  That "seven"
case is actually incorrect ... the other three serial ports aren't
connected to anything.
So:  yes, adding a few hundred useless sysfs nodes *IS* a problem
in the target environment of embedded boards.
Note that "read-only until export" is far from straightforward
to achieve.

Which fails in a common case:  chip labels are not unique.

Apples vs oranges.  Use the same command syntax if you're going
to make comparisons; I can save even more with "+export/-unexport"
syntax.  For comparable syntax, your stuff *IS* bigger.

The #3 option presumes some file listing chips and ranges too,
since GPIOs are exported only on demand.  Ditto #2 and #4...
