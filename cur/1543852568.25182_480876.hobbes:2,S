It is quite possible. All I've done was:
# make all
# make modules_install
# make install
And update of /boot/grub/menu.lst. Additionally I've tried to do it using:
# make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers
And installing the deb package. Please correct me if I've made any mistakes.

Here you are, this is output of 'mount' while in recovery mode using
kernel 2.6.18.1
$ mount
 /dev/hda3 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
/sys on /sys type sysfs (rw)
varrun on /var/run type tmpfs (rw)
varlock on /var/lock type tmpfs (rw)
udev on /dev type tmpfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
devshm on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda5 on /usr type ext3 (rw)
As you can see, no trace of /dev/hdb1.
Best regards,
Jano
