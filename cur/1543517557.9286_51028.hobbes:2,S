I was running an upgraded RH6.1 system
with a RedHat 2.2.12-20 kernel
and a Realtek PCI-NE2k NIC.
Everything worked well, but the NIC
was terible.
So I go a NetGear card, and configured
the tulip driver from RedHAt.
I started getting nfs errors.
from the log:

I have nfs mounted home directories. It makes using X horrid.
The system freezes untill nfs get OK for the errors.
The reason for the new NIC was to get *BETTER* nfs performance
not worse.
tedpc is my Athlon running linux
pr is a Sparc20 running Solaris 2.6
I never had these problems with the old NIC.
I've also tried the 2.2.13-0.4 kernel from Rawhide
with the same results.
