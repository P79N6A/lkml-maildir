Hi Lars,
I presume you meant "DFS".  I can't comment on the details of the plan for GFS 
just now, however consider OpenGFS: yes, it needs and has a cluster 
infrastructure.  The kernel does not dictate anything about that 
infrastructure.  Each DFS is free to implement its own infrastructure, 
possibly involving kernel extensions.
