It is impossible to do that way. If you need to protect your condition
variable you probably actually want to disable interrupts while the
driver is unsafe to receive. If the driver is slow you should make the
irq routine atomically test a bit flag and queue the packet to a seperate
sk_buff queue for delayed processing. When you sort the condition out, clear
the bit flag and empty the delayed queue
