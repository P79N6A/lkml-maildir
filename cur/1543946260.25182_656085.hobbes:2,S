Do you still have it?
I thought about writing my own but ended up being too lazy for that @)

Yes.

They do have a longer pipeline, so yes more penalty (5 or 6 stages more iirc),
but also a lot better branch predictor which makes up for that.

Well if it still happens on gcc 4.2 with P4 tuning you should
perhaps open a gcc PR. They tend to ignore these bugs mostly in
my experience, but sometimes they act on them.

At least the respective optimization manuals say they should be used.
I presume they only made this recommendation after some extensive
benchmarking.

Yes, but a lot of the heuristics are pretty strong (>80%) and gcc will
act on them unless it has a very strong contra cue. And that should
normally not be the case.
