hm, function-exit is a quite bad name i think that tells nothing to 
the user. I like "function-cost tracer" because that tells the user 
what it's all about in the end.
Or perhaps we could name it the "callgraph" tracer? (as opposed to the 
simpler function tracer which traces function entries) Note that we 
could use the output to build function call coverage graphs.
It definitely must convey the idea that this is a more capable (and 
also more expensive) form of function tracing.
