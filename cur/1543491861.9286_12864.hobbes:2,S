Hello,
I have a PCI ESS sound card, SOLO-1, with the ES1938S chipset.
I saw in the latest alan's patch, 2.2.5-ac3, there is a ess_pci, but there is
no author of that code.
I think there is only (at the moment) the MAESTRO support, but in the source
code I saw some mention to SOLO card.
The pci device list doesn't detect the card... I have Unknown vendor. 
Any help is welcome!
thanks in advance,
Fausto
