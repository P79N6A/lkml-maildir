That's a load of bull.
It results in the fact that you need to have a _clear_interface_ between
the hard realtime parts, and the stuff that isn't.
Yes, that does imply a certain amount of good design. And it requires you
to understand which parts are time-critical, and which aren't.

Most real life apps have nothing to do with hard-RT.
