N is the number of objects.
So, for large N, the overhead of SLUB of allocations of size m, where
m % alignment == 0 (for simplicity):
 kmem_cache_alloc case:
  (PAGE_SIZE % m) / m
 kmalloc case:
  nextpowerof2(m) - m
And for SLOB (with Nick's improvements):
 kmem_cache_alloc case:
  0 (the remainder of the page is usable for other allocs)
 kmalloc case:
  2 bytes (or whatever the minimal arch alignment is)
SLUB wins by two bytes on kmallocs that happen to be a power of two,
ties on kmem_cache_allocs that happen to evenly divide PAGE_SIZE and
kmallocs 2 bytes smaller than a power of 2, and loses everywhere else.
It also loses whenever a particular type/size has both short-lived and
long-lived objects because of pinning. This effect is worse on small
machines as it's easier to pin all of memory.
The downsides of current SLOB are:
 - single lock
 - potentially long walks to find free blocks
The average case walk has been shortened quite a bit by Nick's
patches. The combinatorics here are enough to make Knuth hand-wave,
but we can in theory get close to O(1) performance when we don't have
much memory pressure. Needs some serious benchmarking. When we DO have
memory pressure, both SLOB and SLUB will degrade to forcing the kernel
to walk a bunch of pages.
