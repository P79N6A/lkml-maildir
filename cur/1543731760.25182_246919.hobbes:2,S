I mostly agree, like I was saying earlier, file types are needed!  The kernel doesn't have to know about all of them, just some of them.  It should be possible to attach a file type to everything so you know what kind of thing it is, not just block or character device or file, but something like a MIME type.  If space is a concern, add to the inode a unique 8 byte character code for each popular type and a global translation table to get back the MIME string.
The kernel (includes file systems and plug-ins) would have to know some standard file types and how to compare them for indexing purposes.  For example, an integer attribute like the year a music album was released would be stored as a 4 byte attribute "file" with a type like "primitive/int32", which tells the kernel to use 32 bit integer number comparison for indexing order.  Another type the kernel could be aware of are the file types used for security attributes.  A third kind it might need to know about are the computed attributes, which get set whenever related attributes they are computed from change.  For any unknown types, the kernel just stores the data and doesn't do any extra processing.
Optionally the kernel could also maintain the global list of all file types and their properties (such as which ones are indexed, which are computed), though that could also be done in userland if you aren't doing indexing or computed attributes or other fancy operations.
The determination of the types would be in userland (smart programs would write the type when they created the file).  Like you said, a daemon could classify unknown files in the background (BeOS does this).  Most of the uses of the file type would also be in userland, such as deciding which program can handle a given file, or what icon to display, or to hint that a file/directory/attribute thing should be interpreted as an old style directory to the user, or to mark a file thing as being worth backing up (don't need to back up the computed ones).
