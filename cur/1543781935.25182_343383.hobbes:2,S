Hi,
I now use a notebook that uses RTL8139, and I encounter exactly the same
problems as this:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0402.3/1289.html
I know use Fedora Core 4 on this box.
With a Linux FC4 kernel (not customized yet).
As well as I still encounter the problem, I guess the solution has not
been found. 
Is there a summary of what should be done to resolv it? 
I would like to apply the needed patches. The only problem is I am not a
very very good C coder so that I could do it the wrong way.
Thank you :-)
