I did a lost of testing and experimenting, and found the assembler loop
the best solution (it has the finest granualrity even on slower
systems).

Oh! Shame on me! I must have missed something here!
I could swear that this didn't work for me. I tried it yesterday, you
are right, there is microsecond resolution. Even on an old 2.0.38
kernel...
This solves all my problems. I'll loop on gettimeofday().
Thanks a lot!
