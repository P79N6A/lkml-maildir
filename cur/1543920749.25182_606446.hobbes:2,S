Ah ok, I see why you are confused. The SCSI case is one, it allocs and
frees the sg table each time. The entries are thus always initialized
when they end up in blk_rq_map_sg(). However, other drivers allocate one
at driver init time and use that one all the time. It needs to be
initially cleared, but it wont be cleared before each request mapping.
And that is fine, as long as we do clear entries in blk_rq_map_sg().
