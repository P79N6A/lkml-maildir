Sorry but this patch is pointless.  If I wanted to prevent you from
connecting to www.kernel.org 80 and I knew your source port number
I'd be directly sending you fake SYN-ACK packets which will kill
your connection immediately.
If you want reliability and security you really should be using IPsec.
There is no other way.
Cheers,
