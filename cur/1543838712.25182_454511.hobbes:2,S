Hey Roman,
	How much real-world testing have you done with these patches? I've been
running w/ this set of patches for a few days and I've been noticing my
system is having difficulties synching up w/ the NTP server.
I haven't been logging anything, so its currently uncertain data, but
normally I've seen NTP sync the time within 1-2ms in just an hour or so,
however since this morning (~6 hours ago) I'm seeing it still 10ms off.
I'm going to let it run for the rest of the day then try to bisect the
patches to see where things went wrong. I'll let you know as soon as I
find anything.
thanks
-john
