Me too, well, mine wasn't quite complete yet, so I'll switch to
reviewing yours later instead.  I've not glanced at it so far, but
what you've said about it leaves no doubt that you got my point.

Gosh, I thought it was just a bit of one-up-man-ship from Andrew,
futex on non-linear!  I doubt anyone really cares about that case.

No, it should be VM_MAYSHARE (if the behaviour is to depend on
whether user said MAP_SHARED or not: which is a good starting point,
but if odd readonly compatibility issues force us away from that
position, perhaps VM_MAYSHARE won't in the end be the right test).
I agree it's peculiar, I agree (search LKML archives for VM_MAYSHARE)
that again and again I'm having to make the distinction (I can't pretend
to explain it, just indicate it), which strongly suggests it should be
done better.  But that's some other patch, some other time,
for now use VM_MAYSHARE.
Observe fs/procfs/task_mmu.c show_map checking VM_MAYSHARE for 's'.
Observe mm/mmap.c do_mmap_pgoff vm_flags &= ~(VM_MAYWRITE | VM_SHARED).
VM_MAYSHARE reflects whether user chose MAP_SHARED, VM_SHARED may not.

Yes, I had that flag removed while it served no purpose,
but I'm happy to have it back once it's useful for efficiency.

Will it be worth the code added to handle it?  I wonder the same of
non-linear (sys_mremap and sys_remap_file_pages, familiar troublemakers).
But all credit for handling them, good to reduce "undefined behaviour"s.
