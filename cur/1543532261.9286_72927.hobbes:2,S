Okay.  I was just a concerned newbie.  Some document I hit
mentioned that bdflush was no longer used in the latest 2.2 kernels.

Tune the I/O subsystem?  I think that is _exactly_ what I am
looking for, but have absolutely _no_idea_ where to begin.  I've
hit the source (apparently not enough ;-), but would like to hear
any suggestions anyone has.
And I _do_ concur that I need to flush regularly instead of less
frequenty.  When I get a big write, it seems that Linux will just
let the memory fill up and then write when its full.  While this is
fine for a workstation, it's killer on a server with NFS clients
(the SMB clients are not affected).

Actually, these large "flushes" happen only occassionally (every 30
minutes), but for 15-60s.  That's the problem.
> may be larger than the write-back buffers in your RAID controller
Yes, that is exactly it.
My GDT controller has 64MB of RAM, but it is flushing 200MB+ to
disk.  Hence why the RAID controller reports 30-50% full and it
seems to go up and down (as the controller is feed data to write
by the OS).  The second the controller just starts steadily going
down, the "stall" ends because the controller is no longer being
feed data (still writing to disk, but not the PCI bus).

Yep.  When the controller is just flushing its own cache, it's no
problem.  It's when it's being feed over the PCI bus, that's the
problem.

Er, I have not figured out how to do that exactly.  And I've read
quite a bit.  Do I do it with ./update?  Do I have to reboot for
the changes to take effect (I hope not)?
Sorry for such a newbie question.
