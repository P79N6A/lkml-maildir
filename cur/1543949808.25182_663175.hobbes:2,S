If you accuse your testers of coming crying when they report issues then
you'll find less of them bother coming forward. I've worked round the
problem locally by disabling the kernel DRM support and was reporting
the issue:

   to avoid it.
and 
*) In case there was anything I could try out that might help to get the
   problem fixed going forward.
I understand the support for the RS690 is experimental; I'm very pleased
to see it at all in the Free xorg driver. I've also been able to ditch
the fglrx driver on my work machine (which has an X1300 running dual
head). Please don't think I'm unappreciative of your work; if I was I
wouldn't have bothered trying to improve things by reporting my issue.
(I can make the X server crash by trying to use Xv as well; I assume
there's no point in reporting that somewhere?)

Perhaps rather than just automatically enabling the new experimental
support in the kernel there needs to be a CONFIG_DRM_RADEON_EXPERIMENTAL
option or similar to enable support for chipsets that aren't believed to
be stable?
