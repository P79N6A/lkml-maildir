for normale usage I'm happy with it, even under heavy load (two kernel
compiles with -j4 on a single processor machine) I can type into my
xterms mostly instantly.
However starting new applications/xterm's is a pain, a plain xterm which
starts normally within a second takes about 3-5secs. Openoffice isn't
usable at all. But on the other side I normally don't compile with
-j4...
However the xmms didn't skip once while playing. I applied this patch
ontop of 2.5.73-bk7.
