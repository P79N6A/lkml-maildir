My concern is that the tests are rather pointing that something in
kernel is not implemented correctly. _The_ checks in particular.
Because if they _are_ implemented correctly, you don't need to patch the
functionality in the user space.
And if the kernel code does check the incoming arguments correctly,
what is the point to check them again? Just to make the point, that
passing in not an absolute path is not portable?
