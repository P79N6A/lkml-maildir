Also, I don't like the overloading of ->trylock, this is really hackish.

Agreed.
Perhaps it is a bit easier to use spin_lock_nested() + __wake_up_common()
directly (we have a lot of wake_up_xxx helpers), but this is up to you.
Offtopic question. Why do we have so many lockdep stuff in timer.c and hrtimer.c ?
We never lock 2 bases at the same time, except in migrate_timers(). We can kill
double_spin_lock() and base_lock_keys[] and just use spin_lock_nested in
migrate_timers(), no?
