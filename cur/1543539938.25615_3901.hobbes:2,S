How so? The kernel doesn't look at each instruction before it is
executed... it does clean up _after_ the fact, or arranges so that the bug
can be caught when it tries to bite (f00f case). This is _very_ different
from exhaustively checking beforehand (as is being adovocated here), and it
is done in cases where the fix is cheap (luckily).
