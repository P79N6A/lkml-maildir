Sorry, I meant lots of processors. Does Ultralinux still display "N
penguins found" these days, or did that go the way of "lpN on fire"?

I don't know how expensive it is, you are probably right.

This is the approach Rik van Riel's patch takes, but only with
SCHED_IDLE (based on my reading). It looks like it could easily be
adapted to do what I propose. -- the big question is whether it would
be any help.
To test the effect, we would need a benchmark for which the kernel
currently scales badly due to lock contention, but which also does a
significant amount of user space processing.
