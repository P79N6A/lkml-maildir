Does the debug tools rely on files named *.s then?
There are today ~1400 files named *.S in the tree, but none named *.s.
So my idea was to do it like:
*.S => *.asm => *.o
But if this breaks some debugging tools I would like to know.
Btw. this is not about "case-challenged" filesystems in general. This is
about making the kernel usefull out-of-the-box for the increasing
embedded market.
Less work-around patces needed the better. And these people are often
bound to Windoze boxes - for different reasons. And the individual
developer may not be able to change this.
