I disagree here. Red Hat uses "must pass the cerberus test" as one of the
criteria for kernels. The are other similar criteria, most are obvious (must
boot :). All other distributions have similar tests and a few even use the
cerberus testsuite as well.
Maybe your problem is "absence of tests before Linus releases", well 
even that isn't fully true as distros run these tests on -pre kernels as
well (or -ac kernels, which are mostly in sync with -pre kernels)...

There are a few basic creteria here as well, and 2.4.10 fails on some of
them so far:
1) Must not kill processes as long as there is plenty of swap
   or (possibly dirty) cache memory
2) Must not deadlock (as that is a code-bug)
3) Must not livelock without any progress
Note that no 2.4 kernel so far really achieves 1) in the presence of
highmem; the obvious deadlocks are just pushed further by tuning.

2.4.10 isn't better than 2.2.19 given the criteria above. 2.4.10aa2 might
be though... and 2.4.9acX+Rik's patches are solid in testing.
