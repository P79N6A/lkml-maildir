Not within a particular container. If the process exits but leaves around
some memory charge, then that just remains within the same container.
If you want to remove a container, then you have a hierarchy of billing
and your charge just gets accounted to the parent.

So if someone says they want it 100% correct, I can tell them to use
Xen and not put accounting into any place in the kernel that allocates
memory? Sweet OK.
If we're happy with doing userspace only memory, then a similar scheme
can be implemented on an object-accounting basis (eg. vmas). I think
there is something that already implements this.

That's nowhere near the overhead of pte chain rmaps, though. I think it
is perfectly acceptible (assuming you *did* want to account kernel page
allocations) and probably will be difficult to notice on non-crazy-highmem
boxes. Which is just about everyone we care about now.

In my proposed scheme, it is just the first who allocates. You hope that
statistically, that is good enough. Otherwise you could go into tracking
what process has a reference to which dentry... good luck getting that
past Al and Christoph.

Not the problem of accounting. Any other scheme will have a similar
problem.
However, having the container in the struct page *could* actually help
directed reclaim FWIW.
