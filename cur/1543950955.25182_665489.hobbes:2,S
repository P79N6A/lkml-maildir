Hi all,
This is just a quick dump of my patch stack that is not already in
sched-devel/master (read: this is on top of sched-devel/master).
These patches are lightly tested - compiled only with a single .config
and booted only. Will repost in somewhat smaller chunks once I get around
to actually testing more.
The newest code (and thus least tested) is the new SMP balancer.
Just posting to get it out-there... :-)
If it breaks you get to keep both (or rather, all) pieces, although I'll try
and fix reported issues in a timely manner.
Patches can also be found here:

Happy hacking,
/me off to enjoy the last few hours of weekend remaining.
