I have not put out any patches for 2.3 for three reasons. The first is that
I am myself not using a 2.3 kernel. The other is that there does not seem
to have been much interest in this patch for the development kernels. The
third is that the 2.3 kernel releases happen a lot more frequently than 
updates to the kerneli patches at this point, so there is a certain overhead 
associated with putting this patch out for a development kernel.
But as you bring this issue up, I will start the 2.3 branch soon.
