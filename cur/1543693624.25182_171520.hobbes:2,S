When using 2.6.0-test7 on an ibm thinkpad t21, pmdisk works properly,
though it takes quite a while to write out pages to disk. On my last
suspend to disk, it took on the order of 8-10 minutes. After this
completed, i was able to successfully resume, fairly speedily, however
my hardware clock was 8-10 minutes behind. Does anyone have any ideas
why this is happening? thanks...
