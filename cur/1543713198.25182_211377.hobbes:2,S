pretty useless if you do not see "USB Mass Storage support" config options due 
to disabled SCSI ;)
I'd suggest a comment, when SCSI is disabled, that USB Mass Storage is 
disabled unless you select SCSI. I tried to cook up a simple patch but it 
seems I don't know kbuild very well. The menu structure messed up after I did 
it.
