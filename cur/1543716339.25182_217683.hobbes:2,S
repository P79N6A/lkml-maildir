The EFI spec is here: 
http://developer.intel.com/technology/efi/EFI_110.htm
(SMBIOS pointer is mentioned in section 4.3), but arch/ia64/kernel/efi*.c
already reads EFI.  You may want to look at dmidecode
(
http://freshmeat.net/projects/dmidecode/
), which has code to read
/proc/efi/systab (which, last I checked, itself required a patch).
In kernel space, I think you could just use efi.smbios, but I'm not an expert
on that myself.
