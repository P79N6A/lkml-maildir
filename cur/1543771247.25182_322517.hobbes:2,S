Allocating lots of MAX_ORDER blocks can be very useful for things
like hot-pluggable memory.  I know that this may not be of interest
to most.  However, I've been combining Mel's defragmenting patch
with the memory hotplug patch set.  As a result, I've been able to
go from 5GB down to 544MB of memory on my ppc64 system via offline
operations.  Note that ppc64 only employs a single (DMA) zone.  So,
page 'grouping' based on use is coming mainly from Mel's patch.
