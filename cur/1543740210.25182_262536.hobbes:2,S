Lets try to remember that the x86 WRT time is a real pile of used hay.  Even the 
"fixes" the hardware folks are spinning out reflect a real lack of 
understanding.  A pm_timer that you can not trust is doubly bad, but then they 
thought it was part of the powerdown code so...  The new timer which we may see 
on real machines some day, is still in I/O space (read REALLY SLOW TO ACCESS) 
for starters.
Back in my days at HP we (HP) talked with intel and, to some extent, caused a 
change in the IA64.  That machine, and a lot of other platforms, have decent 
time keeping hardware.  All we have to do is wait for the x86 to die :).
