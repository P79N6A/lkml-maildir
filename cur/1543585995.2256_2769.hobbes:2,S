Having a SIGDANGER would be a fine thing, but this will need patching in all
current daemons and there has to be a possibility to configure the behaviour
of the process when recieving a SIGDANGER. i.e. it is a good idea to kill
apache on a workstation, but a very bad idea to kill apache on a webserver.
Generally I'd like to see such an implementation, but wouldn't it be better
to have a pre-seclction of the processes getting SIGDANGER?
For example: if OOM occours, send SIGDANGER to all non-root-processes with a
nice-level of n or higher (where n should be discussed).
This would make it easy to "configure" SIGDANGER-unaware Applications - in 
the meantime, until all applications are SIGDANGER-aware -  to deal with
OOM-situations. You just do an "nice -n -1 httpd" and one's httpd won't
get killed when OOM occours.
IMO this would dramatically improve the OOM-Problems right now.
