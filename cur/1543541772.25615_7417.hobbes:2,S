Hello to everybody !
	I'm using the linux-2.4.0.test6 kernel and I noticed the
following error during the boot time:
 devfs: v0.102 (20000622) Richard Gooch (rgooch@atnf.csiro.au)
devfs: boot_options: 0x0
kmem_create: Forcing size word alignment - nfs_fh
ACPI: support found
ACPI: PBLK 1 @ 0x4010:6
ACPI:         -0176: <7>ACPI: *** Error: Object type returned from
interpreter differs from expected value
ACPI:         -0176: <7>ACPI: *** Error: Object type returned from
interpreter differs from expected value
ACPI: S1 supported
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Mounted devfs on /dev
Can somebody explain what this is and if it has to be fixed some way ?
I have an SMP dual PII350 box.
Thank you in advance and best regards
