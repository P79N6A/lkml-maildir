Yeah. _But_, all deduced from the code.

Humm... Wouldn't that have made itself evident? The card's not running
in promisc mode all the time, so there should be some problems if the
card would expect the MAC in the reversed order, right? (At least I see
some code that can switch it into promisc mode, so I assume that it is
not enabled all the time).
There _is_ a comment about some cards not generating any TX interrupts
at all. But that seems to predate any card that stores the MAC address
in correct order (the patch for that came after git, the comment
predates git). So assuming that the card wants the address in reversed
order at runtime, would likely imply that _no_ card would generate TX
interrupts (unless promisc?), and the comment basically invalidates that
assumption.

There was once a patch that checked the vendor specific address part,
long ago. No idea what happened to it. But for kexec, I'd say that that
is broken, too.
- ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:00:00:01
- $kexec_incantation
- nv_probe sees 00:11:22:00:00:01
- doesn't match the vendor stuff
- becomes 01:00:00:22:11:00
Oops, that's not quite the expected thing.
No way to tell whether we have to reverse from the address alone AFAICT.
