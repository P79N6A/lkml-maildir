parted and fdisk both write into the MBR signature space, so your
disks should have unique MBR values in them.
Then, F8 anaconda / kickstart can be told on which disk to write its
bits.

  describes this.
I've given up trusting any BIOS to get EDD 3.0 device paths right,
there are just too many broken implementations out there, and
seemingly no real desire on the part of the component vendors to fix
it.  MBR signatures work pretty well - Dell uses this method for every
one of our factory installed Linux systems we ship, so I _know_ it works.
