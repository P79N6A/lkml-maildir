Hi -
I've got a program (a search engine) that will mmap the whole disk if
you
let it, and since I want to run it on my website, I'd like to limit its
physical memory usage.  "ulimit -m", corresponding to RLIMIT_RSS, seems
to be what I want (right?), but I can't figure if it actually does
anything
on Linux.
According to "top", it doesn't seem to limit the RSS size.
Furthermore, a search on RLIMIT_RSS through the kernel source tree gets
only a few hits - the include files, the /proc filesystem entries, and,
under 2.4 only, a single check in the madvise() code.
So, my question - does RLIMIT_RSS do anything?  And how should I go
about limiting this process's real memory usage?
I don't subscribe to linux-kernel, so please include me directly in
any reply to this query.  Thanks.
