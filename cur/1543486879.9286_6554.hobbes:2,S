  Richard B. Johnson mentioned MS negotaiting w/ Disney for a mascot, and
sugested Daffy Duck.
  I was going to suggest Elmer Fudd, both because of the neat last name
and the fect that he never seems to get what he goes out hunting for.
Rabbit season!
Duck season!
Now I'm going to have to go buy a couple WB DVD's and piss my SO off.
Be vewwy quiet, I'm hunting Linux.  Huhuhuhuhuh...
