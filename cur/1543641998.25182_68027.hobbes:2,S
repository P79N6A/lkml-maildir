Your approach is not feasible.
Distributed filesystems have a lot of subtle pitfalls - locking, cache
coherency, journal replay to name a few - which you can hardly solve at the
VFS layer.
Good reading would be any sort of entry literature on clustering, I would
recommend "In search of clusters" and many of the whitepapers Google will turn
up for you, as well as the OpenGFS source.
Sincerely,
