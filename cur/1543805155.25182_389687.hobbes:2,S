Well, I can't say for sure the problem is with ATI's code, but since
we can't see their code to debug it, it's effectively their problem.

That's doesn't matter, since the problem could be in the ATI code
which blows up in mm/swap.c

Umm... isn't there an MESA OpenGL driver stuff out there?  Prboably
not for your ATI card though.  If you can reproduce the crash without
any closed code, then people will try to help you.
