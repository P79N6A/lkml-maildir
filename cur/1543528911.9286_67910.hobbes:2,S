	As Linus seem to allow them to be there, I guess
	they are ok.  (They have been there for a *long* time..)
	Unlike other reply at this indicated, reason for them
	being compiled *modular* is not BSD/GPL license issue,
	rather it is the LZW compression algorithm used in there.
	If you *really* want to know, do ask Linus about it.
