Actually I had to mount it (I  hope that not having it mounted does
not change a lot in this matter). Here is the cat of "devices"  from

I have CONFIG_USB_DEBUG=y set in kernel. However I do not see any of
the messages you are referring to. It does not say that it tried isoc
and falls to bulk, nothing like that. Also nothing about "setting
interface to ?? failed". Which debug option should I switch to see
these?
