Tangential question, what's up with the prism2 driver?
It seems like everybody I meet these days has a wireless card which uses 
the prism2 driver from linux-wlan.org.  And since I just got two of 
these cards (D-Link DWL-650), I am strongly tempted to merge the driver 
into the kernel.
How well does the prism2 driver work with the current wireless driver API?
Is there any particular reason why it is not in the kernel now?
