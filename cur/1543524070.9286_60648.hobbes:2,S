So I'm not the only one having problems with lo ? :-)
I noticed them because fetchmail was unable to deliver my mail.
I just made a test:
1) booted into 2.3.41pre3
2) netstat -s
3) telnet localhost
   ok, I see the login prompt as expected
4) ^D - abort telnet
5) another telnet localhost
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   ***but nothing else for at least 5 minutes***
6) ^C - abort
7) 2nd netstat -s

I've attached both netstat outputs of my example.
This is an alpha 'Noname' AXPpci33 ev4 system.
