Still waiting on a response at 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-video&m=114787670927881&w=2
Oh wait, there was one, but apparently I wasn't CC'd. Adding the right 
list now.
DVB people:
Attila Stehr in a Gentoo bug report pointed out that the DVB frontends
do not link without CONFIG_I2C, and there is no dependency listed in the
Kconfig files.
e.g.:
drivers/built-in.o: In function `stv0299_readregs':
stv0299.c:(.text+0xa4d8a): undefined reference to `i2c_transfer'
I checked and I see this is the case for other DVB components too, such
as the dvb-usb drivers.
I'm happy to patch this, but I'm not sure which approach should be best. 
Should I make CONFIG_DVB or CONFIG_DVB_CORE depend on I2C, or should I 
modify the config blocks for all of the individual options which use I2C 
stuff?
Thanks,
Daniel
