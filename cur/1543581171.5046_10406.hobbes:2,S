Er, what exactly is the CONFIG_PREP stuff in this driver supposed to be
for?  "CONFIG_PREP" doesn't exist anymore to start with, and secondly I'm
not sure if any PReP boxes ever shipped with a riva card to start with.  The
only real way to handle this in 2.4 is something like:
#ifdef CONFIG_ALL_PPC /* CHRP/PMAC/PREP */
#include <asm/processor.h>
#define isPReP (_machine == _MACH_prep)
#else
#define isPReP 0
#endif
That is, if there's really any need to test explicitly for a PReP box.
I asked Ani Joshi about this a while ago, and he wasn't quite sure why they
were in there either..
