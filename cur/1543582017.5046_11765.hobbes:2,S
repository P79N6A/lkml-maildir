Here is a complete trace of the Oops I have.
I have a new compiled kernel with NFSD in the kernel with vmlinux available
for it.
I attached the ksymoops and the gdb stuff
oops.orig : as found in /var/log/messages
oops.ksyms : output of ksymoops
oops.disassemble : output of "echo disassemble nfssvc_encode_diropres | gdb
-batch -x /dev/stdin vmlinux"
Thanks to give an eye
