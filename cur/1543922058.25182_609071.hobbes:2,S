I do not believe the anti-frag status will make a difference as this is
a order-0 failure. Looking at the OOM messages;

No reclaimable memory, no free swap and free memory is below the min free
watermark on the DMA32 zone being allocated from. That system is genuinely
out of memory although I am surprised it didn't fallback to ZONE_DMA but
the likely explanation is the lowmem reserves.

Same again - really OOM.
It seems to be the same all the way through.
I am somewhat at a loss to explain why SLUB would fail in this case when
SLAB wouldn't. One possibility is that SLAB is artifically holding up
processes in allocation so that fewer are running at the same time allowing
the overall job to complete. For a compile-time benchmark, it might not be
very noticable as the processes are already pretty short-lived. It would be
interesting to add more swap so that SLUB doesn't fail and see if there is
a difference in time-to-completion.
If SLUB is faster, it might imply that it is letting more compile-jobs
running at the same time. Output of vmstat during both runs (preferably with
an indication on the SLUB failure where the OOM occured) may tell us. If the
"running" and "blocked" column for SLUB are significantly higher than the
averages for SLAB, would it support that theory Christoph?
Another possibility is that SLUBs runtime overhead is higher although I find
that one harder to believe.
