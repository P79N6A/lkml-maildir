Proper kernel auditing is harder than it looks.  Check the LSM mailing list
archives for the last attempt to get auditing into the kernel - the idea
was basically dropped.
The basic problem is that there exist standards and best practices on how
auditing should be done, and doing it correctly in the Linux kernel would be
quite invasive.  For example, although LSM already provides an exit in the
open() syscall, you can't use it for auditing because not all failures reach
the exit - there are cases (failed on permissions/ACL checks, etc) where the
call is failed and returns before LSM exits are call, and the standards say
those should result in audit records.
Placing the hooks isn't easy either.  You can't hook right at the syscall
level. because you end up having to do a lot of work twice (looking up
pathnames, etc) - both wasteful and prone to race conditions.  Hooking at the
filesystem level isn't right either - if you hook ext2 and ext3, you miss any
events that happen to be on xfs or reiserfs or what have you. If you can't
think of 3 "gotchas" of doing it at the VFS level, you shouldn't be poking in
that code either.. ;)
Good Luck.. ;)
