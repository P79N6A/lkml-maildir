  Yeah - but I wrote that I tried both options - I have emu10k1 new source
  too... I really compiled it from the source.
  However I'm still getting those annoying messages about missing references
  (like I wrote in the last mail)...
  Only to add - you can sometimes run binary module in more versions.
  Before Creative released source I (and there was more of us) used binary
  they provided for 2.2.10. It works up to 2.2.13 - only they added switch
  -f to get rid of version error. For some modules which can last over a few
  kernel releases it is able to "reuse" them...
  I understand it is not the good idea in general but there was no one else.
  So there is different problem here, anyway.
    Regards,

P.S. Besides, is anybody using emu10k1 with the 2.3.x kernels ?
