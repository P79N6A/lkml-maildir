I can't do much testing atm but the similar symptoms happen whilst running
Heroes3 which tends to suck CPU so I think mp3 encoding would work just

Prakash also reported similar problems whilst compiling the kernel. This is
something I can duplicate also. As my kernel compiles the system can't
even keep up with my typing.
