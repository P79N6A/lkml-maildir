Its so slight its useless, and the randomness makes it hard to verify you
fixed a problem. Remember once an exploit appears a box will get scanned
hundreds of times - someone will get the right offset 8)
There is another good reason for offseting stacks within the page -
especially the kernel stacks which is to avoid things like each apache
task sleeping with wait queues on the same cache colour
