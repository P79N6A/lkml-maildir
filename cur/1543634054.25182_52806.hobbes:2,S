Sure it does.
The kernel can offer you the knowledge of a hardware path to your device,
which is given by controller,bust,SCSI target and unit numbers. This is
pretty stable in most configurations.
If you want to have more, you will probably use some sort of signatures.
But that's nothing which happens at SCSI layer.
For plain old SCSI devices, you may e.g. inquire the serial number (INQUIRY,
page code 0x80) which gives you a unique identifier if combined with
vendor and model strings. scsidev does this for you. But it occasinally
fails, as the open on scsi device may fail and we don't know the relation
between the sg devices (that can be used reliably to collect such
information) and the other high level devices. /proc/scsi/map solves this.
