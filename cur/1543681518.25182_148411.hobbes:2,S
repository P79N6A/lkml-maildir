That issue seems to have worked itself out now. I think someone already
munged the relevant Kconfig. It's been a while since l-k got a flood of
"I booted 2.5 and my keyboard doesn't work any more", whereas if you
look at all the "2.6test doesn't boot" bug reports of the last week,
and count how many of them were due to CONFIG_VT=n, you'll notice a much
bigger ratio.

One bug at a time. With the CONFIG_EMBEDDED hack, yes it will 'hide'
this problem, but it'll likely be many months before embedded folks
start thinking of using 2.6 anyways.
