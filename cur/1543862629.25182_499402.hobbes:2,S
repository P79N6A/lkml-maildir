Hi!
I started using el-cheapo usb mouse... only to find out that it breaks
suspend to RAM. Suspend-to-disk works okay. I was not able to extract
any usefull messages... 
Resume process hangs; I can still switch console and even type on
keyboard, but userland is dead, and I was not able to get magic sysrq
to respond.
