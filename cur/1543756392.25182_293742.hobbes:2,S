Roman, if you want this so bad why don't you just pay Larry for the
three month's work? It's just not reasonable to ask someone to do work
for free that the only purpose of is to help someone clone their
system. He's never said he won't make the changes, he just said he
won't do the work for free.
Don't bother with a big response about how all of the revision history
should be available for free and that you shouldn't have to pay to get
it.  For historical reasons we're in the current position and you have
a solution which is to pay to have the work done.
