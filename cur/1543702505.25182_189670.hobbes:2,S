The network cards in this IBM came up great once I found the right port.
Now though I'm trying to find what SCSI driver to use.  lspci reports
"Symbios Logic unknown device (Formerly NCR)" but if I do a modprobe on 
all 3 drivers as well as the one ncr driver no go.  All of them report
no such device except the sym53c416 which says unresolved symbol:
isapnp-find-dev.
Thoughts?
:wq!
