No suprise. 
1Gbit is a bit over 100Mbyte/second
Thats from the card over PCI to memory
Then over PCI from memory to the disk controller
We are up to 200Mbytes/second
Best case performance for a 32bit PCI bus is 133Mbytes/second and you
won't get close to that. Even if both devices are PCI 66Mhz you are
right on the bus limit.
And if its an earlyish PIV what is your main memory bandwidth ?
