	Sorry for the delay - I did the test on other filesystems
as well: "random" (i.e. not rewritten) data after the hard reset were
inside the files in the following filesystems:
XFS
ext3 data=writeback
JFS
and my test program did not manage to put those "random" blocks into the
files when running on ext3 with data=ordered mode (as expected).
	I have tried ReiserFS as well, with mixed results:
- when I hit "reset" soon enough (but well after the HDD LED starts
	blinking), I end up with an empty directory after the reboot.
	It seems ReiserFS caches the filesystem operations much longer
	than other filesystems.
- I have not seen truly random data in the files on ReiserFS after the
	hard reset, but I have seen blocks of zeros instead of either
	old or new data. This may be a pure coincidence, so ReiserFS
	may belong to the same group as ext3 with data=writeback mode,
	but I was not able to make the files contain truly random
	blocks by hitting the reset button.
	So, does ReiserFS do some kind of data journaling/ordering as well?
