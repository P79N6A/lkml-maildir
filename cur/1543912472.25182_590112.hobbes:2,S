Hi all,
on my IBM ThinkPad T23 I often get the following messages (together with
a beep from the speaker):
-------------------
Message from syslogd@stefan2 at Thu Aug 30 22:02:17 2007 ...
stefan2 kernel: Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 30 on CPU 0.
Message from syslogd@stefan2 at Thu Aug 30 22:02:17 2007 ...
stefan2 kernel: Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
Message from syslogd@stefan2 at Thu Aug 30 22:02:17 2007 ...
stefan2 kernel: Dazed and confused, but trying to continue

------------------
There seems to be no pattern in the "interarrival times" of this signal.
Sometimes I get it about every 30 minutes, sometimes only once a day.
It also doesn't depend on the kernel version. I now see this behaviour
on this notebook for 3 years now.
My current kernel version is 2.6.23-rc3 (plain vanilla kernel), Ubuntu
Gutsy Gibbon.
I have googled "Uhhuh. ..." and got exactly 3 (!) entries, but no
solution. But it seems that this is somehow typical for some notebooks,
especially ThinkPads.
Any ideas ?
Stefan
