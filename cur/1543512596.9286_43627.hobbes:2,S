[PLEASE CC me]
I have a zombie on my system that won't die with 'kill -9'...
Extract from 'ps ux' output:
ml267    24078  0.6  6.8  4304 2120 pts/1    S    18:06   0:08 [enlightenment]
Extract from 'ps xlwww' output:
000  1000   290     1   0   0  5128    0 down_f DW   ?  2:18 [enlightenment]
I've been told that "down_f" is a semaphore, and the problem is in the
kernel, not enlightenment, so I thought I'd report it here.
My system is still running at this point, and I'd gladly send some sort of
core dump to be analyzed, if someone would tell me how.
If it's too minor to be bothered with, let me know too, and I'll just 
reboot to regain my resources from the zombie.  (Tears well up in my eyes
as I think about losing my 21 day uptime...)
Also, I wonder why a zombie takes up CPU time?
