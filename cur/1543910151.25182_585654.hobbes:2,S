                ^^^^ This function doesn't exist in recent kernels, so I
guess you are using an older kernel. Which version is it?

Yes, it does look a bit odd. There was a bug fix (which has only very
recently made it into Linus' kernel as of the last GFS2 pull a few days
ago) which fixes a problem in the DLM, although this doesn't look like
that, at least at first sight.
The other thing which you can check is the glock state which you can
find in /sys/kernel/debug/gfs2/<fsname>/glocks on each node. The list is
usually quite large, so its best to just email a url where it can be
found. That will tell you which processes own which locks and thus what
is holding the lock which is causing the problem. Likewise there is also
a debugfs file which contains the locks from the DLM's point of view
too.
Steve.
