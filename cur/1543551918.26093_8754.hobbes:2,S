/usr/include/bits/errno.h assumes that /usr/include/linux/errno.h
always exists.  Linus says that /usr/include/linux should contain
constant versions of the kernel headers that reflect the kernel used to
build glibc.  However on many distributions, /usr/include/linux is a
symlink to some directory under /usr/src, which is fine until that
directory changes or goes away.  The same problem applies to
/usr/include/asm.
You probably do not have a /usr/src/linux directory any more.
Reinstall the kernel headers that came with your distribution then ask
the distributor why they ship in that format.
