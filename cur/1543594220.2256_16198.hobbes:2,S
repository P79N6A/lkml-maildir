You're missing the point -- it's a bad precedent.
How many kernel forks and patches exist out there on the net?
Many of these patches will get merged eventually.  But it is a bad idea
to include bits of such into the Linus tree, when they are not used in
the Linus tree.
-Exceptions- to this policy should be carefully considered...  reserving
syscall and sysctl numbers certainly makes sense.  Bloating kernel_stat
with tons of unused numbers, some specific to web servers AFAICS, does
not make sense.
Tangent:  Why is this webserver-specific crap in kernel_stat anyway?  It
looks like there should be a separate per-cpu structure for webserver
statistics.

Even when merging Tux, I would hope Linus would not apply this
particular change.
