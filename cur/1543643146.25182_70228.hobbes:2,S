On IA-64, I've got the arch/ia64/kernel/efivars.c module that exports
/proc/efi/vars/{NVRAM-variables}.  It violates several rules of /proc
which I'd like to address in 2.5.x via driverfs.
1) It's in /proc but isn't process-related.
2) It exports its data as binary, not ascii.
Proc was chosen because it was simple, didn't require a major/minor
number, showed easily the set of NVRAM variables that were available
without needing a separate program to go and query a /dev/efivars file
to list them; cat and tar are sufficient for making copies of
variables and restoring them back again.  These exact features make
driverfs make sense too.
1) is easy to fix.  2) a little less so.  The data structure being
exported is a little over 2KB in length; The data is binary (itself a
variable length set of structures each with no ascii representation).
An ascii representation in "%02x" format will be longer than a 4K page
given to fill out and return.  Undoubtedly there's a better way to
handle this, and I'm open to suggestions.  The thing being exported is
efi_variable_t.
For such cases where the data being exported is really binary,
having a common set of parse/unparse routines would be nice.
