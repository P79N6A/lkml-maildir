Read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/sysrq.txt

There were a known problem with reiserfs that it might sometimes
deadlock in out-of-space situation.
This is fixed in 2.4.21

This is raid5 stuff resyncing. Probably it is normal if you just
setup the raid5 array.

Ok, that's where sysrq-T/sysrq-P traceswould be most useful.
And if you'd try with 2.4.21 that would be even better.
