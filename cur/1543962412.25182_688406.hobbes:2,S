OK, so one approach would be to check for irqs being disabled,
perhaps as follows, on top of my previous patch:
		struct call_single_data *data = NULL;
		if (!wait) {
			data = kmalloc(sizeof(*data), GFP_ATOMIC);
			if (data)
				data->flags = CSD_FLAG_ALLOC;
		}
		if (!data) {
			if (unlikely(irqs_disabled())) {
				put_cpu();
				return -ENOMEM;
			}
			data = &d;
			data->flags = CSD_FLAG_WAIT;
		}
		data->func = func;
		data->info = info;
		generic_exec_single(cpu, data);
That would prevent -ENOMEM unless you invoked the function with irqs
disabled.  So normal callers would still see the current failure-free
semantics -- you really don't want to be inflicting failure when not
necessary, right?
There could only be one irq-disabled caller at a time, which could be
handled using a trylock, returning -EBUSY if the lock is already held.
Otherwise, you end up with the scenario called out above (which Keith
Ownens pointed out some years ago).
Does this approach make sense?
