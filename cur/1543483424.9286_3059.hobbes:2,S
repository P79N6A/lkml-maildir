  You know,  People who start insulting others to make a point just show 
they need a reality check.  I have a P2 with 30Gigs of disk space.  Great
for compiling kernels.  It's not my only machine.  It's the best set up of
them for just this reason.  However, before I had it, it was extremely 
agonizing when someone would come across with an attitude like this. 
  Part of the draw for linux is that it can run on anything down to a 386.
Now unless you're willing to go buy computers for everyone who doesn't have
alot of disk space to play with or provide cycles and custom kernel 
compiling services, SHUT UP.  It's attitudes like your that make it REAL
hard to convert people away from windows and keep em.
