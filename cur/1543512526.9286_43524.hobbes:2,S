This was my biggest concern, but I noticed the other oddities, so I
brought them up.

hrm, i guess it's time for me to look at the whole source file in scope
then, which explains the next question:

As i was brushing my teeth (I read mail first thing in the morning) this
occured to me. Of course, i felt stupid. More i thought about it, we'd
have to create a global-ish buffer for it, that the driver just assigned
to cgc.buffer. 
eg:
void* master_buffer;
master_buffer = (void *)kmalloc(CD_FRAMESIZE_RAW*MAX_FRAMES); 
/* MAX_FRAMES to avoid this confusion in the future */
...
memset(master_buffer, 0x00, CD_FRAMESIZE_RAW*MAX_FRAMES);
cgc.buffer = master_buffer;
which is not fun, as there could be potential locking issues and
it's generally messy. Sorry to ask a stupid question.
