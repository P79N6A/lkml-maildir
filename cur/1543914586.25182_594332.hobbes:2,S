The to_video_device and the container_of (cd, struct video_device,
class_dev) (as you noticed at the above drivers) are used to provide
procfs interface.
On videodev, there's the v4l2 core stuff, used on all V4L drivers. It
allows some control to the V4L devices (basically, see/change the
modprobe loading parameters).
The other drivers that uses to_video_device (or the container_of
alternative) to create other userspace interfaces, specific to each
driver and not documented at V4L2 API:

>From the above, you can clearly see that et62x251 and s9c102 provides an
interface to directly change a register at the device. The other drivers
allows reading/changing a few controls directly via /proc (this is also
possible, using V4L2 interface). This is not recommended, since V4L2 API
should be the proper way to control the devices.
>From my POV, a driver that is creating its own userspace API is not
fully compliant with V4L2 API.
So, the proper fix is to make those drivers dependent of V4L1, where
this kind of usage were valid.
