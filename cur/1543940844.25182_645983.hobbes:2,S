Hi Stephen,
Thanks for your helpful reply and especially for the literature pointers.

Yes.  If you look further down the page, you will see that with jumbo 
frames (which we have also tried) on Gb/s ethernet the maximum throughput 
is:
   (9000-20-20-12)/(9000+14+4+7+1+12)*1000000000/1000000 = 990.042 Mbps
We are very far from this number -- averaging perhaps 600 or 700 Mbps.

At least in principle, we should have NO congestion here.  We have ports 
on two different machines wired with a crossover cable.  Box A can not 
transmit faster than 1 Gb/s.  Box B should be able to receive that data 
without dropping packets.  It's not doing anything else!

This is extremely helpful.  The typical oscillation (startup) period shown 
in the plots in these papers is of order 10 seconds, which is similar to 
the types of oscillation periods that we are seeing.
*However* we have also seen similar behavior with the Reno congestion 
control algorithm.  So this might not be due to cubic, or entirely due to 
cubic.
In our application (cluster computing) we use a very tightly coupled 
high-speed low-latency network.  There is no 'wide area traffic'.  So it's 
hard for me to understand why any networking components or software layers 
should take more than milliseconds to ramp up or back off in speed. 
Perhaps we should be asking for a TCP congestion avoidance algorithm which 
is designed for a data center environment where there are very few hops 
and typical packet delivery times are tens or hundreds of microseconds. 
It's very different than delivering data thousands of km across a WAN.
Cheers,
