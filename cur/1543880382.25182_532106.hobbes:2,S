Lying to the VM doesn't seem like the best way to handle this.  A lot of tasks, 
including interactive ones have some/many pages that they touch once during 
startup, and don't touch again for a very long time, if ever.  We want these 
pages swapped out long before the box swaps out the working set of our 
non-interactive processes.
I like the general idea of swap priority influenced by scheduler priority, but 
if we're going to do that, we should do it in a general way that's independent 
of scheduler implementation, so it'll be useful to soft real-time users and 
still relevant if (when?) we replace the current scheduler with something else 
lacking a special "interactive" flag.
