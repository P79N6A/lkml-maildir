You _DONT_ have 256MB sound DMA buffer. Apply this one and look how
much you _really_ have.

Take a look at sound drivers, they already subdivide DMA buffer into
smaller chunks (dmap->nbufs, ...). _Maybe_ it would be possible to
make these chunks physically non-contignuous... (It is _not_ trivial,
I took a look myself).
