Subject: [patch] 2.5.70-mm3: sdla.c doesn't compile

It seems the following compile error when trying to compile sdla,c 
statically into the kernel comes from Linus' tree:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      drivers/net/wan/sdla.o
drivers/net/wan/sdla.c: In function `sdla_cmd':
drivers/net/wan/sdla.c:443: warning: comparison of distinct pointer 
types lacks a cast
drivers/net/wan/sdla.c: In function `exit_sdla':
drivers/net/wan/sdla.c:1685: `sdla0' undeclared (first use in this 
function)
drivers/net/wan/sdla.c:1685: (Each undeclared identifier is reported 
only once
drivers/net/wan/sdla.c:1685: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [drivers/net/wan/sdla.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
I'm not sure whether the following is the best solution but it fixes the 
problem:
