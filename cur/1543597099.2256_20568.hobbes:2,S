Subject: [PATCH] More pedantry.

Using 'errata' as singular instead of 'erratum' seems to one of the more 
common illiteracies found in the kernel.
I'm not sure what the text for the IA64 CONFIG_ACPI20 option 
("Enable ACPI 2.0 with errata 1.3") is supposed to mean, so I can't tell 
whether that's wrong. It's the only user-visible instance.
As the other instances aren't user-visible, it's probably not worth the 
bother of fixing them. 
However, I think we should make an exception for arch/ppc/kernel/misc.S and
arch/i386/kernel/smp.c, in which which we invent a new plural 'erratas' for
the word 'errata' which was already a plural. That is just such an abuse of
the language that I felt it needed to be fixed even though it isn't
user-visible.
English or C. Pick one. Be incoherent in the other.
