well, I guess all existing OS-Level virtualizations
(Linux-VServer, OpenVZ, and FreeVPS) have stated more
than one time that _sharing_ of resources is a central
element, and one especially important resource to share
is memory (RAM) ...
if your aim is full partitioning, we do not need to
bother with OS-Level isolation, we can simply use
Paravirtualization and be done ...

Linux-VServer (and probably OpenVZ):
 - shared mappings of 'shared' files (binaries 
   and libraries) to allow for reduced memory
   footprint when N identical guests are running
 - virtual 'physical' limit should not cause
   swap out when there are still pages left on
   the host system (but pages of over limit guests
   can be preferred for swapping)
 - accounting and limits have to be consistent
   and should roughly represent the actual used
   memory/swap (modulo optimizations, I can go
   into detail here, if necessary)
 - OOM handling on a per guest basis, i.e. some
   out of memory condition in guest A must not
   affect guest B
