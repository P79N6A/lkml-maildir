Subject: [PATCH] clear PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY for truncated pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/1/202

The `truncated' page in block_write_full_page()/nobh_writepage() may
stick for a long time.  For example, ext2_rmdir() will set i_size to
0, and then the dir inode and its pages may hang around because of
being referenced by some process.
To produce this situation:
In terminal 1:
                $ mkdir hi; cd hi
                $ sleep 1h; cd ..
In terminal 2:
                $ rmdir hi
The dir 'hi' is deleted in terminal 2 while still being referenced by
the shell(as working dir) in terminal 1.  The deleted inode 'hi' with
its dirty-and-truncated page will stay for 1 hour, during which the
pdflush will retry the page _at least_ once every 5s.
So clear PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY to prevent pdflush from retrying on it.
