I'm trying to cleanup the config for Promise IDE, see
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109849081408193&w=2
Original code in drivers/ide/Kconfig for 2.6.9-mm1:
config BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_OLD
    tristate "PROMISE PDC202{46|62|65|67} support"
config PDC202XX_BURST
    bool "Special UDMA Feature"
    depends on BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_OLD
config BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW
    tristate "PROMISE PDC202{68|69|70|71|75|76|77} support"
config PDC202XX_FORCE
    bool "Enable controller even if disabled by BIOS"
    depends on BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW
(helps stripped...)
I want to make PDC202XX_BURST and PDC202XX_FORCE be selectable if any of
_OLD or _NEW is selected. So I wrote:
menu "Promise PDC support"
config BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_OLD
    tristate "PROMISE PDC202{46|62|65|67} support"
config BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW 
    tristate "PROMISE PDC202{68|69|70|71|75|76|77} support"
config PDC202XX_BURST
    bool "Special UDMA Feature"
    depends on BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_OLD || BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW
config PDC202XX_FORCE
    bool "Enable controller even if disabled by BIOS"
    depends on BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_OLD || BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW
endmenu
Result (menuconfig) is:
  x x      <M> PROMISE PDC202{46|62|65|67} support                        x x  
  x x      < > PROMISE PDC202{68|69|70|71|75|76|77} support               x x  
  x x      [ ]   Special UDMA Feature (NEW)                               x x  
  x x      [ ]   Enable controller even if disabled by BIOS (NEW)         x x  
ie, the two flags are grouped inside the PDC_NEW config, instead of at
the same level.
I tried grouping things under submenus in several ways, with dummy config
variables, anyways it always ends up grouped below PDC_NEW, instead that at
the same level that both PDCs...
I have no idea on how to do it...
Any clue ?
TIA
