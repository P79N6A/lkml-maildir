Use rsync only if it is available:
    rsync-available := $(shell rsync --version > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo y)
    copy := $(if $(rsync-available), rsync --delete, cp)
    modules_install:
               [...]
               $(copy) source target

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
