The system will be more responsive but won't ever come back to normal 
operation and if I use my computer just for some chatting/writing/browsing 
the ksoftirqd-problem won't ever happen. 
It is also very hard to reproduce with only high network load. I ran some 
test with 100Mbps load (RX and TX both) for 24hours without any problems 
but soon as I started to compile some stuff or doing something 
cpu-intensive the system would do crash-boom-bang.

When the system has gone to this state you will have to wait quite a long 
time to receive a new line.
