Sure, a reasonable enough requirement.

I suspect we can avoid maintaining separate hierarchies if not required.
        mkdir /dev/res_groups
        mount -t container -o cpu,mem,io none /dev/res_groups
        mkdir /dev/res_groups/A
        mkdir /dev/res_groups/B
Directories A and B would now contain res ctl files associated with all
resources (viz cpu, mem, io) and also a 'members' file listing the tasks
belonging to those groups.
Do you think the above mechanism is implementable? Even if it is, I dont know 
how the implementation will get complicated because of this requirement.

This requirement that each process should be exactly in one process container
is perhaps not good, since it will not give the fleixibility to define groups
unique to each resource (see my reply earlier to David Rientjes).

If the user intended to have a common grouping hierarchy for all
resources, then this movement of tasks can be "atomic" as far as user is
concerned, as per the above example:
        echo task_pid > /dev/res_groups/B/members
should cause the task transition to the new group in one shot?

Sounds good.

Ok, sure.

I suspect the manipulation to resource group hierarchy (and the
resulting lock contention) will be more frequent than to the cpuset 
hierarchy, if we have to support scenarios like here:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/5/178
I will try and get a better picture of how frequent would such task
migration be in practice from few people I know who are interested in this
feature within IBM.
