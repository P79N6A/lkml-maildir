yes, i still get build failures:
kernel/sched_rt.c:574: error: 'struct rq' has no member named 'cpu'
kernel/sched_rt.c:619: error: 'rq' undeclared (first use in this function)
kernel/sched_rt.c:619: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
kernel/sched_rt.c:619: error: for each function it appears in.)
kernel/sched_rt.c:667: error: 'rq' undeclared (first use in this function)
so i've excluded tip/sched/rt from tip/master for now.
