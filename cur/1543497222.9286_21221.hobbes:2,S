	Ah, now this sounds familiar.  You are running out of memory,
	and that horrendous sluggishnes is due to swapping to disk.
	You need more of physical memory, and/or swap space.
	But like Alan said, telling your CURRENT kernel version would
	also help at solving this.  What is the one you are running ?
	What kind of disk system you have ?  (IDE/ATAPI, SCSI/...)
	What distribution are you using ?  Have you customized anything ?
	If kernel 2.2.5/whatever at RedHat 6.0 (for example) is having
	these same problems, then the kernel core coders really need to
	know about it!   If 2.0.* behaves badly, *shrug*...
	Anyway, at the situation of userspace process growing until
	"free" reported space is gone also from swap, the SYSTEMS should
	not deadlock all by itself.

	At an xterm, do repeatedly run "free" program while trying to
	get that problem message with your current method.  Do note
	the amounts of "free" during that time.  Do they go to zero ?
	Then (after recovering from the hangup) Try to use some different
	(non-GUI) POP email client by which you can pull the messages out
	of your ISP to your local disk.  (I use  mutt )
	If the message is *large*, systems reading everything into
	memory (like NetScape Communicator does) will require MASSIVE
	amounts of physical ram to produce any decent performance,
	and a plenty of swap to work at all.
