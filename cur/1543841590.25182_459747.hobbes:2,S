Why do you consider this a hack? I have always felt that librpc requiring
you to open separate ports for every program you register was a poor
design. The RPC header contains the program number, and the RPC code
is fully capable of demuxing incoming requests. So I do not think it is
a hack at all.
And yes, Solaris NFSACL resides on 2049 too.
