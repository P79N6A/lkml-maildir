Ntfsprogs is a library and set of utilities to do variuos things with the
ntfs filesystem. It is not the kernel driver.
And the kernel driver is what you give the write ability to the ntfs
filesystem. And you are right -- the old driver in fact does not support
writing (yeah, DANGEROUS means your filesystem will get damaged with very
high probability).
There exists a new ntfs driver called NTFS-TNG, which is present already
in 2.5.x kernel series and it has its backport to the 2.4.x kernel series
(you'll find it at 
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/
).
This driver has no write support yet, but it allows you to overwrite the
files, without changing their attributes and size (ie. mmap() the file,
change the contents, write() the file). And the overwrite is considered
safe.
