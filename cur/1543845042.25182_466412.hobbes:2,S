This was not Rob. I sent this bad code out in a roll up of support for
non-x86 systems (and bad process for not running sparse on the
patch which passed the buck onto someone else to find).
I think it might have been for an IA64 offset issue someone was seeing. I
cannot find the original mail on the issue in my mail archives.
I will try and track down a IA64 system to see if we can verify this is
really needed. If not we should revert back to the original dword
implementation.
