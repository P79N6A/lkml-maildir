Linus,
The patch you provided patched without any rejects. However,
the system won't boot. It will not even get to
  "Uncompressing Linux". After the GRUB loader sign-on,
the interrupts just remain disabled (no caps-lock or num-lock
change on the keyboard).
I patched Linux-2.6.9. Could you please review your patch?
I will await the possibility of a simple typo that I can
fix by hand before reverting.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
