That's exactly the way it seems.

Yes, UDMA/33 is enabled and working on the drive (using hdparm -d 0 makes the
problem way worse and my drive performs about 1/4 the speed).

First, lets be fair, we're comparing a UDMA/33 IDE drive in a 1 year old laptop
(IBM Travelstar, if your interested) to a true SCSI Disk Subsystem with
mirrored/striped Ultra160 SCSI disk connected via 64bit PCI/66Mhz bus, so yes,
the SCSI subsystem is MUCH faster.  Specific numbers:
Laptop with TravelStar IDE HD Max sustained read: 16.5MB/s
Server with Ultra160 SCSI disk array Max sustained read: >100MB/s
That's a big difference.  The Travelstar is probably only 5400RPM and is
optimized for power savings, not speed, the SCSI subsystem has multiple 15000RPM
in a striped/mirrored configuration for speed.
Later,
Tom
