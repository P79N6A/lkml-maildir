What do the Penguins At Large think about this?  The following is a
presentation of simple PCI probe code which I think can be useful.  It
is small, and can easily replace existing probe mechanisms.  As the
structure itself is only three members, it is quick to put into the
code, and painless to maintain.  For small or simple drivers this may be
enough.  For more complex drivers, using a callback scheme makes it
easier to step up to the pci-scan code.
