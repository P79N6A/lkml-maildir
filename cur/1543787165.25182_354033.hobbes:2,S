I think you overlooked alloc_page_buffers call from
create_empty_buffers .... It is called with third argument as 1 and it
is the retry argument in alloc_page_buffers function which checks
if(!retry) return NULL; so it will never return NULL if retry is 1

what kind of difference ?? If its allocation of page buffers then
async IOs are not allowed to fail so it waits to allocate
memory/buffers for it ....
