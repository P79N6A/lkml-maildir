But, it's been called from an __init section, it will also trigger an
warning too. So, it
 will remain as it was. If we goes to hunt these warnings ( I mean
we've to replace __init __alloc_bootmem() with __cpuinit
__alloc_bootmem() ) , it's not certain when it will stop. Likely , we
need to replace a lots of __init with __cpuinit.
