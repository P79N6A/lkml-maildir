Most non-x86 architectures take a large hit for unaligned accesses.
If the ethernet chip cannot land the beginning of the packet at an
arbitrary byte offset (a modulo 2 offset for ethernet is needed for an
aligned IP header) then the rx_copybreak is set to the ethernet MTU
so that all packets get copied into new buffers where they can have
their header aligned.
