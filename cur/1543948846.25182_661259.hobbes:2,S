Hi
just found out that the eSATA connector on my Intel DQ35JO motherboard 
doesn't work... because it is connected to the controller with product ID 
29b6... And this ID is not yet handled by the driver. Can I have a patch, 
please?:-) I think the correct entry would be
{ 0x8086, 0x29b6, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, ich8_2port_sata },
just because it also has two ports. Am I right? I would rather not test 
blindly.
BTW, why are these 2920, 2926, and 29b6 IDs not handled by the ahci 
driver? The board-manual does say ICH9...
Thanks
Guennadi
