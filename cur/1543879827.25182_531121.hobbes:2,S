Ingo's scheduler is completely different to any I've seen proposed
for Linux. And after he did an initial implementation, he did post
it to everyone.
Maybe something he said offended someone, but the process followed
is exactly how Linux kernel development works (ie. if you think you
can do better, then write the code). Sometimes you can give suggestions,
but other times if you come up with a different idea then it is
better just to do it yourself.
Con's code is still out there. If it is better than Ingo's then it
should win out. Nobody has a monopoly on schedulers or ideas or
posting patches.

Well that's some pretty strong criticism of Linux and of someone who
does a great deal to improve things... Let's stick to the topic of
schedulers in this thread and try keeping it constructive.
