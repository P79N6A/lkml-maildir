Maybe a bit pointed, but the question is: would a user perhaps want to 
know about a security fix a month earlier (knowing that bad people might 
guess at it too), or want the security fix a month later (knowing that the 
bad guys may well have known about the problem all the time _anyway_)?
Being public is different from being known about. If vendor-sec knows 
about it, I don't find it at all unbelievable that some spam-virus writer 
might know about it too.

The fact is, 99% of the time, nobody really does care.

I agree. And if i thad been out in the open all the time, the fuss simply 
would not have been there.
I'm a big believer in _total_ openness. Accept the fact that bugs will 
happen. Be open about them, and fix them as soon as possible. None of this 
cloak-and-dagger stuff.
