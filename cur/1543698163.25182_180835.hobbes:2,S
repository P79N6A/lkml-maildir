Hello,
I'm 14 years old, and i'm french. When I've making package for my distribution,
FNux, of the 2.4.23, I see a big problem.
The extraversion variable of the Makefile is very badly interpreted.
When the kernel is installed, I have 2 directory of modules :
/lib/modules/2.4.23
/lib/modules/2.4.23-fnux (my extraversion is -fnux)
This is a very problem for the linux distributions, beacause the EXTRAVERSION is
often used.
Thanks
Alexis ROBERT
