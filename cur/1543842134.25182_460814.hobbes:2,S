indeed, this is a very recent fix from Jarek Poplawski - not yet in 
Linus' tree but already in Andrew's.

With
CONFIG_SMP=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y
# CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is not set
spin_unlock_irqrestore() goes through lockdep but spin_lock_irqsave() doesn't.
Apparently, bad things happen.
