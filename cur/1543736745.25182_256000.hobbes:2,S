I'm of two minds about this.  On the one hand, I agree with you.  2.4 is 
in maintainence mode, and making a big change like this to the graphics 
driver system is outside that scope.  On the other hand, if the 2.4 and 
the 2.6 code bases diverge too much, bugs fixed on the 2.6 side are less 
likely to be fixed on the 2.4 side.  Moreover, with more divergence 
between the two, each gets less coverage.  I could really go either way 
on it.

I guess we'd want something like 'drm_core_version_<version number>'. 
Each layered driver would just have to reference the matching symbol. 
One neat thing about doing this is that we could theoretically make core 
modules that support multiple versions of the interal API and export a 
drm_core_version_* symbol for each.
I have only one problem with this type of setup.  If the user has a 
version mismatch, it's not trivially obvious why they aren't getting 
direct rendering.  There are already a number of ways a user can get 
"stuck" like this, and this adds another one.  It's not a new problem, 
but it is one that needs to be addressed.

Anyone have a PCI card so that we can test actually using more than one 
at a time?  In the mean time, I think just having them all load at once 
and one of them work is good enough.
