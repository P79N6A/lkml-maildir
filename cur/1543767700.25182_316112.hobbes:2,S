A new version of Mercurial is available at:
  
http://selenic.com/mercurial/
This fixes a handful of bugs reported last night, most notably failing
to pull from the http repo. This turned out to be a failure to quote
'%' characters. Thanks to everyone for their feedback.
Once you've got the new version installed, to pull the repo:
  hg init
  hg merge 
http://selenic.com/hg
  hg checkout    # 'hg co' works too
The web protocol is painfully slow, mostly because it makes an http
round trip per file revision to pull. I'm about to start working on a
replacement that minimizes round trips.
