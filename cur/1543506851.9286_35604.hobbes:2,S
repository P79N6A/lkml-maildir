Hi all,
I've recently been fidling with the SCSI CD-ROM driver to support
the new additions to cdrom.c and noticed that no one has been
maintaining that particular code for some time (years?).
I'm prepared to take over maintaining that as well as the
Uniform CD-ROM layer and ATAPI driver I'm managing now if
there are no objections. Please let me know.
