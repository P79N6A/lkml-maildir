 There's no easy way of fixing this up in the handler, so that's the plan
for now.  It also puts more info in the TSS dump right away.

 Looks like the only clean way is to follow the TSS back link and manually
validate the segment registers before returning:
  invalid FS,GS -> 0
     "    DS,ES -> __USER_DS
          CS,SS -> panic?
 Bad things can happen if a debug fault happens in certain places... for now
the solution is to only support int3 breakpoints and avoid those places.
 Given the above, I hope to be able to put int3 instructions in either
kernel or user code and get snapshots of CPU state in the kernel TSS.
