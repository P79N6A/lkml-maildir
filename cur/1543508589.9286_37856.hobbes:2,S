Hi,
	That sound problem that I had a while back is *still* persisting. To
prove the point, I would suggest that I make a recording (using a
different machine) of the sound output of my PII 400 and encode it into
mp3 - just a short sample - 5 secs with CD ripping/then after the 5
second rip you will notice the drastic difference as the rip operation
completes. If anyone is interested in this crude, but *effective*
demonstration, I will do it and put the mp3 on the web so that you get
an idea of the terrible sound!!!!
Please reply to my personal address if you want this for bug fixing
purposes...
Jon.
