I have got the same problem with an older, 3-4 years old, ISA PnP Card (cs4232 chipset)
and kernel  2.2.x and 2.3.x, no problems with kernel 2.0.x
I have posted this problem some weeks ago in this ML and in some NGs, but i got
no answer thats help. :( 
In a german linux NG, there are more Peoples that have the same Problem with kernel 2.2.x.
