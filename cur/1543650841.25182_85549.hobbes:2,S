I think you and I are in agreement (as always has been in the
past), Dave.  LKCD is meant to create a base for disk, network,
or any dump method.  If Red Hat wants netdump to be the primary
dumping method, that's Red Hat's decision, and more power to
them.  If SuSE wants disk dumps, that's SuSE's decision.  But
for both of them to have to roll their own every single release
or kernel upgrade is unproductive.
What's most concerning about this entire discussion is that I
bet < 20% of the people discussing this have actually LOOKED at
the LKCD patches to see whether or not this is as invasive,
difficult, bloated, or anything negative.  We've spent over a
month now posting them, getting comments, responding to all of
the comments, making sure feedback is accounted for and
responded to, only to get an "LKCD is stupid" type response.
