I agree, and I will do just that.

For drivers that don't have an active developer, I'll handle the review
commends and fix things up.  Some of these drivers do have active
developers, and I'm sure they will be the ones handling the review as
well.

As it's "just a driver", the odds of that happening are probably going
to be very slim.  We can cross that bridge when we come to it.

Not yet, but some of the network drivers are looking much better and I
think they will move out soon.
One of the v4l drivers should move out for .30, I need to get some time
to send the patch to those developers.
