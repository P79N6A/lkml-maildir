The manpage was my only reference.  It was enough:
       The -F switch specifies an external  deformatter  program.
       This  program should read data from its standard input and
       write to its standard output.  The  program  must  produce
       exactly  one  character  of  output  for each character of
       input, or ispell will lose synchronization and corrupt the
       output  file.   Whitespace  characters (especially blanks,
       tabs, and newlines) and characters that should  be  spell-
       checked  should  be  passed through unchanged.  Characters
       that should not be spell-checked should be converted  into
       blanks or other non-word characters.  For example, an HTML
       deformatter might turn all HTML tags into blanks, and also
       blank  out  all  text  delimited by tags such as "code" or
       "kbd".
I don't know if aspell has filter support.  I'm running 
International Ispell Version 3.2.06 08/01/01
It came standard on SuSE.

It isn't GPL but the license terms are not unacceptable.
