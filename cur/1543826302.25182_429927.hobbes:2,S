Subject: mixing cache size on xeon4's in smp system

I have a 2.4 gig hz xeon (533) with a 512k cache.
Can I use a 2.4 gig xeon  (533) with a 1Mbyte cache in an smp configuration?
Lets say it "works" -- what tools do I use to determine it really 
"works".
I've  heard advice "see if flakey things happen" -- that's not advice I want 
to follow...
Anyone have practical experiene with this?
