What about compilers chewing on source files coming in over NFS rather
than resident on local block devices?  The network waits need to be
broken out into NFS versus other, or UDP versus TCP or something.  e.g.
waits due to the user not having typed anything yet, or moved the mouse,
are going to be on TCP connections.
