If the avg_slice is very small we know the task will probabilistically
go away soon regardless where the wakeup cames from. I don't think the
logic has connection to the kind of wakeup, it only has connection to
the kind of "running task".
Infact waiting "bash" or "ksoftirqd" to go away is the right thing to do
to fix the suprious migrations of cpu intensive tasks too, no matter
where the wakeup cames from.
The only risk here is that we never know from the scheduler if the
running task with the small avg_slice will really go away this time too
or not. And if it doesn't go away this time, we may not do the best
global decision by not migrating the wakenup task to the idle cpus, but
the probability information provided by avg_slice should cover this
problem.
Of course this is theory, I didn't attempted to test it.
btw, I remeber Ingo some year ago said on l-k that rescheduling
immediatly every idle cpu isn't the best thing to do.

Of course waiting for the slice to end anyways is the natural first
step. As said above the point of the probability information of
avg_slice is to render very unlikely the "task doesn't block THIS time"
case.
