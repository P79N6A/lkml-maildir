We asked for help on this before, but no one responded.
How does kstkeip value relate to values in the symbol table,
startcode and endcode?  Sometimes kstkeip is within
startcode to endcode, sometimes it is possibly related by an
offset, other times it doesn't appear to be related at all.
If this is in documentation, please let us know where.  We
have looked in proc documentation and the howtos.
Please cc me.
