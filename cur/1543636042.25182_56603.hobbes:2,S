Lets look more closely:
#ifndef HZ
#define HZ 100
#endif
#if defined(__KERNEL__) && (HZ == 100)
#define hz_to_std(a) (a)
#endif
And:
$ grep hz_to_std arch-*/param.h
arch-l7200/param.h:#define hz_to_std(a) ((a * HZ)/100)
arch-shark/param.h:#define hz_to_std(a) ((a * HZ)/100)
As I said, tbox is broken, so ignore that.
And hz_to_std gets used (fs/proc/array.c):
                hz_to_std(task->times.tms_utime),
                hz_to_std(task->times.tms_stime),
                hz_to_std(task->times.tms_cutime),
                hz_to_std(task->times.tms_cstime),
So merely grepping for HZ doesn't actually tell you anything.
All /proc values are in 100Hz units on ARM.
