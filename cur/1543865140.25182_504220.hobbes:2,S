Yes. Sleeping isn't enough - we have to be sure it won't wake up and
perform work at inappropriate times (we don't know what process X might
do if it did wake; the result could be an inconsistent image). It
therefore needs to enter the refrigerator function so that the freezer
code can ensure it remains inactive until the suspend-to-whatever cycle
is complete.

No, you don't need to. We have recalc_sigpending() in the refrigerator
function.

Yes, that looks good to me.
