This change went into drivers/block/rd.c in 2.5 recently:

 		if (rw == READ) {
-			flush_dcache_page(page);
+			flush_dcache_page(sbh->b_page);
 		} else {
 			SetPageDirty(page);
 		}
The trouble with that is that there is no variable called sbh defined
in this function, rd_blkdev_pagecache_IO.  Thus we get a compile error
on PPC.  The problem wouldn't show up on x86 since flush_dcache_page
is a no-op (i.e. do { } while (0)) there.
What was the change trying to achieve?  What was wrong with
flush_dcache_page(page)?
Thanks,
Paul.
