Hello!
> Is this right?
Yes, it is almost right. Outdating entry is required if
new state is not NUD_REACHABLE, otherwise it could became reachable
occasionally. Yes, it is bug.

Because we know that we hear it, but we are not sure that it hears us.
NUD_REACHABLE is set, when we have at least some hint, that the host
is reachable from us, f.e. unicast ARP reply to our request.

Do telnet and tcpdump, and you will see. For these 5 seconds
we will know that host is reachable without ARP.

"Neighbor solicitation". Terminology and state machine
is described in details in RFC2461 for IPv6. ARP shares it,
doing some reasonable emulation for missing features.
