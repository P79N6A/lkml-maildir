Nah, It's not worth it.  I have some mutex test modules that search the
tasks to determine what priorities are there and uses that info for
setting the priorities of the threads it creates. Yes, this can be done
from userland as well, but i was being lazy and just wrote eveything in
the module.
So, forget what I asked for and do what you want.  These modules are
really just for testing specific things that I work on and I can find
other ways around it.  Really the easiest thing is to just add the EXPORT
myself since I need to recompile the kernel anyways.
Thanks anyway,
