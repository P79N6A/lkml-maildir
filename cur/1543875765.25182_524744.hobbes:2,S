Andi,
(sorry for the cut-and-paste). 
touch_nmi_watchdogs sets EACH CPUs alert_counter to 0.
void touch_nmi_watchdog (void)
{
        if (nmi_watchdog > 0) {
                unsigned cpu;
                /*
                 * Just reset the alert counters, (other CPUs might be
                 * spinning on locks we hold):
                 */
                for_each_present_cpu (cpu)
                        alert_counter[cpu] = 0;
        }
        /*
         * Tickle the softlockup detector too:
         */
        touch_softlockup_watchdog();
}
The call to touch_softlockup_watchdog here is incorrect -- it is only 
touching the current CPU's softlockup.
