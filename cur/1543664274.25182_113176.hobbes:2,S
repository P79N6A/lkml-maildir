Please use ACPI_MTX_DO_NOT_LOCK flags.
1- all others user land are no more scheduled, and irqs are disabled.
2- the saved memory image is the one that appar 'randomly' when the suspension
   happen, it is then possible that that we enter acpi_get_register()
3- acpi_get_register() touch one semaphore (a mutex) if you pass ACPI_MTX_LOCK,
   then it is possible that this mutex is not released:
   we are supposed to go to 'ret_point' in arch/i386/kernel/acpi/wakeup.S
4- after resuming, any try to acquire this mutex will deadlock (this will happen early
   in acpi_leave_sleep_state()).
