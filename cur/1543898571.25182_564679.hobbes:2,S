(to avoid a possible confusion: I meant, most users of flush_workqueue()
 should be converted to use cancel_work_sync/cancel_delayed_work_sync
 which in turn use wait_on_work()).

Not sure I understand. Yes, we can have false positives, but I think the
ordering in the workqueue doesn't matter.
If A does NOT take a lock L1, then it is OK to do cancel_work_sync(A)
under L1, regardless of which other work_structs this workqueue has,
before or after A.
Now we have a false positive if some time we queue B into that workqueue,
and this is not good.
We can avoid this problem if we put lockdep_map into work_struct, so
that wait_on_work() "locks" work->lockdep_map, while flush_workqueue()
takes wq->lockdep_map.
But probably we don't need this right now, at least until we really
have a lot of false positives while converting from flush_workqueue()
to cancel_work_sync/cancel_delayed_work_sync.

Well, I am not sure, think about the shared workqueues like keventd_wq...

Isn't it better to call lock_release() with nested == 1 ?

Why do we need __wq ?
	+#define create_workqueue(name) \
	({							\
		static struct lock_class_key __key;		\
		__create_workqueue((name), 0, 0, &__key);	\
	})
Actually, I'd suggest to rename __create_workqueue() to __create_workqueue_key(),
and then you need the only change in linux/workqueue.h
	- extern struct workqueue_struct *__create_workqueue(...);
	+ extern struct workqueue_struct *__create_workqueue_key(..., key);
	+ #define __create_workqueue(...)	\
	+	static struct lock_class_key __key;	\
	+	__create_workqueue_key(..., key);	\
but this is a matter of taste.
Btw, I think your patch found a real bug in net/mac80211/, cool!
Oleg.
