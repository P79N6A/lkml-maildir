Decrease rlim_cur then. Usually people dont have several accounts

Nice catch, root can do that and I think current->user->signal_pending can get
negative. Not completly sure though.

Simple app posted by Nikita (attached) together with MySQL and 
sql-bench for creating mysql threads.
The setuid() was added by me now.
