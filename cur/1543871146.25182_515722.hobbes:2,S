Thats why nsproxy has pointers to resource control objects, rather than
embedding resource control information in nsproxy itself.
From the patches:
struct nsproxy {
+#ifdef CONFIG_RCFS
+       struct list_head list;
+       void *ctlr_data[CONFIG_MAX_RC_SUBSYS];
+#endif
}
This will let different nsproxy structures share the same resource
control objects (ctlr_data) and thus be governed by the same parameters.
Where else do you think the resource control information for a container
should be stored?

tsk->nsproxy->ctlr_data[cpu_ctlr->id]->limit (4 dereferences) is what we 
need to get to the cpu b/w limit for a task.
If cpu_ctlr->id is compile time decided, then that would reduce it to 3.
But I think if CPU scheduler schedules tasks from same container one
after another (to the extent possible that is), then other derefences
(->ctlr_data[] and ->limit) should be fast, as they should be in the cache?
