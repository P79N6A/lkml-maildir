The main purpose of my mail was to get an answer whether the NULL check 
should be removed or whether there's a NULL dereference that could 
happen in practice (which would have been a real bug).
A NULL check too much is not a real bug and therefore it can't count as 
a regression, so from my side it doesn't matter whether you push it as 
"trivial enough" for 2.6.25 or as "not urgent" for 2.6.26.
