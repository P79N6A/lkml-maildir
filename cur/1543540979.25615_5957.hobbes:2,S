% mkdir /tmp/abcd
% mkdir /tmp/abcd/xyz
% touch /tmp/abcd/xyz/foo
% ls /tmp/abcd/xyz/foo
/tmp/abcd/xyz/foo
% cd /tmp/abcd/xyz
% chmod 0 /tmp/abcd
% ls /tmp/abcd/xyz/foo
/bin/ls: /tmp/abcd/xyz: Permission denied
% ls foo
foo
 Ie. the kernel still resolves _at access time_ "/tmp/abcd/xyz", _even
though_ it is also ".".

 Assuming you have access to the dir (Ie. you are doing 
open("./abcd", ... ) then you don't need to go any further back[1].
 Also when I do the "chmod 700 /tmp/abcd" I _know_ (assuming there
aren't any acls on it) that xyz and xyz/foo are unreachable from other
users, what I don't want (and what I thought some people were
advocating) is for there to be a dynamic acl on tmp that lets a
group/person go inside "/tmp/abcd".

 If you mean that doing 'chacl -R "user bob: +rx" /tmp/' would do something
clever inside the fs so that only one acl was changed, then
fine. However if you mean that 'chacl "user bob: +rx" /tmp/' would be
dynamically inherited by "/tmp/abcd" then I think that is a Really Bad
Idea(tm)[2].
[1] You could say you never do and that when you do
"/tmp/abcd/xyz/foo" you just have to go forwards through the whole
path. 
[2] If I'm really off base here tell me, but I can't think why you'd
want to base a file system feature around "chmod/chacl -R" ... esp. as
the idea of reference counting acls and just linking to them would
make this operation pretty fast and space efficient anyway IMO.
