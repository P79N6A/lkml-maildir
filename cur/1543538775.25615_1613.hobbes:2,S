Erm? Any cabling that is not capible of reaching full wire rate (i.e. it's
cause bit errors) 24day/365.2x/daysyr is garbage and should be distroyed
right away.
Of course we're talking about a full duplex, switched network here (he
mentions the dual systems in question were used in a cluster). As far as I
recall you should be able to get 12.01MB/sec on 100mbit ethernet. 
I'd start screaming on Linux-kernel if I typically saw less then
10.5MB/sec application to application level performance on switched 100bt.
