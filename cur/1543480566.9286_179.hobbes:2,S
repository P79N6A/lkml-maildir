I have an ES1868, use SB driver (module) from standard kernel tree.
Between pre5(?) and pre7, base volume level dropped significantly.
That is, the same sound files with the same mixer settings are less
loud in pre7 than in pre5.  I think this is not normal.  I have to
shift mixer levels almost to maximum to hear anything.  Is it a known
problem?
