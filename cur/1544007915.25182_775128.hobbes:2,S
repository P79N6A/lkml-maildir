I looked at the full version of this, and it looks really slow.. As I
recall the biggest problem with the -mm version was it's cacheline
bouncing (pointed out by Ingo), and yours doesn't _seem_ to fix that. In
fact your version looks a lot worse..
So really between the two if we want mainline likely profiling the -mm
version is a better choice.. The reason that version never went into
mainline is cause neither me or Andrew felt strongly that this was
useful in more than just -mm ..
If you look at the output from the profiling long enough it becomes
clear that it's frequently misleading .. In the short term a certain
branch might be likely, and in the long term it isn't.. So you can't
really blindly start converting the annotation..
I should also mention that I didn't write the -mm version alone, it was
an effort between three people me, Andrew, and Hua Zhong (CC added)..
