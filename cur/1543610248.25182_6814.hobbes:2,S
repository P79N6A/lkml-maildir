I would anticipate seeing this problem with their kernel source RPM.  In
fact, I do,
you have to do a make distclean before you can use it because of the way
their rpm
script munges all the versioned trees into a tmp area during RPM creation.
There's only
one source tree (usually the last one they built) and lots of binary rpm
versions from the
one tree (i.e. i386, i686, etc.).
