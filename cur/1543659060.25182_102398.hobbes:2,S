	It looks good to me, although I haven't tried it or fully
comprehended every line of Christoph's devfs_{,de}alloc_devnum cleanup
(I have looked at it a bit before sending this email though).
	One really minor suggestion: perhaps Christoph could add an
entry in the giant change log in fs/devfs/util.c so that people know
who to contact if there is a problem with his number allocation
change.
