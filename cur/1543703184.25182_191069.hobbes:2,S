Hi Eddie.
I have Asus A7V, KT 333
AMD 1800+
Gforce 2gts
768 DDR Kingston
settings on
pre-empt
AGPART
not using framebuffer.
As you see, very similar setup, apart from the riva fb.
But I have had  a framebuffer working with help from some patches available on the gentoo forums, but they don't work on the latest
kernel build. So i dropped it.
I never had any problems with the nvidia drivers.
not on 2.4 or 2.6 always worked :)
I dont know how this can help you, but having 2 similar setups
maybe helps finding whats wrong on your setup that makes it not work.
Feel free to ask for anything that might help you.
