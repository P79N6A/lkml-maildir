Let's not. I'd rather have the best kernel developers concentrating on 
finishing important kernel features rather than digging their way out 
of esoteric optimizer debugging sessions only to find it was a flaw 
in gcc. The difference in performance boost between -O2 and greater 
levels isn't usually enough to make a significant impact, not as 
significant as the introduction of important new features, for 
example.
