My guess on the order is this:
task 1 waits for IO in the page fault.
task 2 calls truncate, which does zap_page_range() on the range that page
is in.
task 1 wakes up and maps the page.
task 2 calls truncate_inode_pages which removes the newly mapped page from
the page cache.
Now the state is that the page has been disconnected from the file, but
it's still mapped in task 1's address space.  That task thinks it has valid
data from the file in that page, and may continue to read/write there, and
assume any changes will get written back..
