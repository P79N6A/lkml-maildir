Hello Stephen,
I've just switched from 2.2.18 to 2.4.3 (on a Dell Inpiron 8000, r128 M4
adapter) and I am experimenting some problems with Xfree 4.02 (debian woody)
and (probably) APM. When I resume after a suspend, the X server
hangs. Connecting through ethernet, using strace -p `pid-of-Xfree` wake up
the Xserver. Everything is OK if I use kernel 2.2.18.  I've tryed the NoPM
option, but it is ignored by the Xserver:
(WW) R128(0): Option "NoPM" is not used
Any Idea ?
