Of course not :-) They are indicate just that you are STILL unaware about how

Oops. There are a lot of peoples who can tell the truth far more often then I

Since you are REALLY clueless here. See below. This is really not relevant for

I'm NEVER claim something so stupid. May be on drugs I'll do but I'm not use
drugs.... Of course swap file should not contain holes -- swap subsystem in
Linux is not clever enough to fill this holes on swapon command :-(( This is
not unique requirements and could be easily fullfilled on ext2fs with 10Tb
files (on Alpha or Sparc of course -- on x86 there are famous 2Gb limit :-)

No. I'm not overlooked this sentence. No way. This is why you could not use
cp and should use dd instead. cp will make file with holes. Latest kernels
could use swap files >128Mb BTW.

GOSH. FANTASTIC ! You are THAT clueless !!! This is really shame for more then
year old linux user ! Are you REALLY unaware about what "holes in files" means ?
Damn. Of course you could make 1Gb file on ext2fs without ANY HOLES in them.
File will not be contigous but this is not a problem for swap file... Ok. If
you are not aware about what are "holes in files" then what the hell you are
doing in linux-kernel list ??? Short example:
-- cut --
[root@localhost /root]# cat test.c
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
main() {
  int fd=creat("/tmp/testfile",S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR|S_IRGRP|S_IWGRP);
  lseek(fd,0x40000000-1,SEEK_SET);
  write(fd,&fd,1);
  close(fd);
}
[root@localhost /root]# gcc -O6 test.c -o test
[root@localhost /root]# ./test
[root@localhost /root]# ls -al /tmp/testfile
-rw-r-----   1 root     root     1073741824 Dec 22 16:08 /tmp/testfile
[root@localhost /root]# du -s /tmp/testfile
4       /tmp/testfile
[root@localhost /root]#
-- cut --
See ? There are file /tmp/testfile with 1Gb size but this file use only 4K on
disk since there are VERY VERY big hole. Such file could not be used as swap
file... Non-contigous file is not a problem for swap, file with holes is.

When I'm need really big swap area for some reason I'm use temporarily created
100-120Mb file on ext2fs :-) Like this:
-- cut --
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/swapfile count=120000 bs=1024
mkswap /dev/swapfile
sync
swapon /dev/swapfile
-- cut --
And of course win386.swp CREATED BY Windows 9x is usually NOT contigous :-))

Hm. You are not only clueless but you also do not want to think for minute :-((
Swap partition is improvement of the same level as raw I/O. The only excuse for
them is that they are already in kernel...
P.S. Your archive of old kernels is nice idea though...
