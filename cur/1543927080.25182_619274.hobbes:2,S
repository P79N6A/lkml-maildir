Heh, well... 
In this case, DaveM just proposed something akin to your
__dma_buffer :-)
On the other hand, after discussing with James, it looks like we'll just
be reverting the patch that removed the kmalloc of the sense buffer
since non cache-coherent archs are supposed to enforce kmalloc alignment
to cache lines.
__dma_buffer still seems like a good thing to have if too many other
drivers are hitting that but for this specific problem, it's not the
approach that we'll be taking.
Cheers,
Ben.
