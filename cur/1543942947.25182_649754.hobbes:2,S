Very strange, as the tcpdump you gave shows that the remote peer only 
sent "220-\r\n"
This was ACKed, and then nothing but timeout. We can conclude remote 
peer is *very* slow or a firewall is blocking trafic after 6 bytes sent :)
Could you give a tcpdump for the same destination, on 2.6.19 this time ?
