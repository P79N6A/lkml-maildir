I'd like to point out, however, that Pace sub-license RISC OS.  As
far as I am aware at present, RISCOS Ltd do not distribute the code
in question, and neither does Pace Microtechnology Ltd.
It has come to my attention that some people are trying to implicate
the above companies in this.
I would strongly suggest people do not start to make (unfounded) claims
against neither RISCOS Ltd nor Pace Microtechnology Ltd unless they
have proof, in which case such proof should first contact the
appropriate copyright holders concerned.
