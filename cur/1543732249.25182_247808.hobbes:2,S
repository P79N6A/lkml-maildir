Registering with an ID of 0 is bad because you've no idea what existing
device node you may reallocate and thus what permissions may be present
for access unless you sweep all of storage.

Agreed. It also needs reigstering with LANANA to avoid /dev namespace
collisions irrespective of the device numbering and to ensure the
namespace is common across all vendors regardless of their dev
management tools. Without LANANA we'll get 
#if UDEV_REDHAT
#elif UDEV_SUSE
#elif DEVFS_SUSE
#elif GENTOO
#endif
type stuff in programs .. 8(
Send the proposed /dev naming for the device and details in the same
format as Documentation/devices.txt to device@lanana.org, and Torben
will either disagree with you or assign name and possibly numbers.
