It is not SHF_ALLOC, so it will not make it into vmlinuz either.

?
gcc-2.96-RH (2.96-91 and above) and recent gcc 3.1 CVS together with
recent binutils support merging strings already. Unlike killing
.comment/.note sections, this saves real kernel memory.
This reminds me, I should finally hack up binutils so that it uses SHF_MERGE
for .ident directives automatically.
