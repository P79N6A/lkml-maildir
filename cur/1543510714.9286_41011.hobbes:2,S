Hi,
I've seen some reports of people getting "access beyond end of device" file
access errors in 2.2.12, I have just seen a large number of these myself during
a program run that was doing considerable file io.
However, does anyone know if this particular problem is fixed in the "nearly
there" 2.2.13?  For a variety of reasons I'm not currenty in a position to test
this myself (other users won't let me shut the machines down just yet....).
Mark
