I now have the patches for this, but I have to fix up fs/block_dev.c to
also honour the block size thing because otherwise the two are still not
in sync.
I'll send out a test-patch later this evening, I hope.

It's certainly solvable, but it is also certainly very fraught with tons
of small details. I'll be very happy if people end up looking through the
patches _very_ critically (and don't even bother testing them if you don't
have a machine where you can lose a filesystem or two).
Hopefully in another hour or two (but the first version is going to have
some ugly stuff in it still).
