Well, the main problem is that you are trying to drive a PATA controller 
with a SATA driver :)
If you wanted to list this as a feature request on 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
 that might be reasonable...
I have no idea how different the PATA controllers are from the SATA one 
I tested.  Although it does detect your device, I don't know what 
differences exist...
