If you:
   1. mmap file A at virtual address X
   2. use memory at X
   3. mmap file B at X
   4. look at X
If its a virtual cache, and it wasn't flushed at step 3, then step 4
will see A's contents rather than B's.

If you mmap a file multiple times, then the kernel will assign multiple
different virtual addresses for the same page cache page(s).
