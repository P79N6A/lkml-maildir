I think what he meant was that it is unfair to blame reiser3 for data
loss in a massive failure situation as a case example by itself.  What
would be more appropriate (and fair) is saying something along the lines
of "in a machine with DMA failure, reiser3 hosed a drive, while ext3
only lost x data (or nothing).  In my situation, every bit of massive
failure robustness counts... "  This of course assumes you actually had
the *exact* same problem with hardware under ext3, pretty much in every
detail.  Of course, so many subtleties interact in massive ways with
filesystems and hardware problems, so we have to keep in mind how much
difference that can make (all the difference in the world), and that,
really, without a statistically significant sample size and some real
analysis, hardware failure comparisons are impossible to do fairly.
Of course, if ext3 were proven to be more robust against failures, I bet
the reiser team would be very interested in all the forensic data you
can offer, since, from what I've seen, they are always trying to make
reiser as good as possible---in speed, flexability, *and* robustness.
If they didn't care about the last, they'd benifit greatly from not
journaling!  :-P
