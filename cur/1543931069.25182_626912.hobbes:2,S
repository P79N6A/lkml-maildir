The problems caused by this patch where nagging me at the back of my head
from the begging. Why should we fail on a check of FAIL_FAST in all kind
of weird places like boots, when the only place that should ever set the 
flag should be one of the multi-path drivers. finally it struck me:
It might be a bug in ll_rw_blk at blk_rq_bio_prep() there is this:
static void blk_rq_bio_prep(struct request_queue *q, struct request *rq,
			    struct bio *bio)
{
	/* first two bits are identical in rq->cmd_flags and bio->bi_rw */
	rq->cmd_flags |= (bio->bi_rw & 3);
	...
Now this is no longer true and is a bug.
Second bit of bio->bi_rw defined in bio.h is:
#define BIO_RW_AHEAD	1
but
Second bit of rq->cmd_flags is __REQ_FAILFAST
so maybe we are getting FAILFAST in the wrong places?
(I will look for an old patch I sent a year ago that fixes
this bug)
