I didn't say anything about the _quality_ of the clock. Quality is
unrelated to the intended frequency.
When running without an external reference, how should Linux keep time?
The kernel can assume that a video reference is used, or it can assume
that the system was designed for DOS timekeeping. The kernel can't do
anything about an unstable or out-of-spec clock, but it can at least
start with an estimate that is appropriate for common modern hardware.
