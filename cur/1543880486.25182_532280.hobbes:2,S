hmmmm. How about the following then: default to nice -10 for all 
(SCHED_NORMAL) kernel threads and all root-owned tasks. Root _is_ 
special: root already has disk space reserved to it, root has special 
memory allocation allowances, etc. I dont see a reason why we couldnt by 
default make all root tasks have nice -10. This would be instantly loved 
by sysadmins i suspect ;-)
(distros that go the extra mile of making Xorg run under non-root could 
also go another extra one foot to renice that X server to -10.)
