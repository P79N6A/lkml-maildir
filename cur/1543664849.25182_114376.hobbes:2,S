I am trying to load and boot the kernel from a non-standard address
(0x200000). I am using the SYSLINUX boot loader, which loads the
kernel at that address. I have also made changes to the kernel to
setup code and startup_32() function to effect the same. When I boot
the system It says
Loading.......... Ready
Uncompressing Linux... OK Booting the kernel
and then hangs.
I guess the reason being the System.map entries are still using the
PAGE_OFFSET = 0xc0000000, as opposed to 0xc0100000.
I have the following questions??
1. How do i change the System.map to get the right PAGE_OFFSET.
2. Will it work if I load and boot the kernel from a different address
like (0xdf000000)??
3. Am I in the right track or missing something.
Thanks
