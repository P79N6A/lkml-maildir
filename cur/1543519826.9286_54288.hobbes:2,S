Last night I went through all the bus speeds up to 94 to see when and
how often the messages appear.((my case has extra cooling +300w ps)I was
not aware of them till I read about them on the list.)) My setup is
2x400 Celerons with BP6NJ bios. Up to a bus speed of 82 I had
absolutelly no errors then they started at 83 sporadiclly becoming
commonplace at 94Mhz My cpus seemed to work fine up to that point so I
cut the test off there. I would have to conclude cooling + ps size and
overclocking are all a factor in this.
At normal speeds up to 75Hmz with adequate cooling I don't see this as
being a problem. The reason I aborted at 94Mhz is that any voltage
change above 2.05v saw the temperature rise dramaticlly(over 100
degrees)so for all pratical purposes I would say I was at the chips
limit.
Conclusion: Errors are hardware related.
