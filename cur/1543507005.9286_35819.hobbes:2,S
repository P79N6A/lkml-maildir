Hi all,
What is the best way to have the kernel notify a user space daemon
that some event has occured without user space resorting to polling an
ioctl(ugh)?
Presumably, I could create a /dev/foo device and have the user space
daemon sleep forever in select(2) till the kernel does something, but
this would require I create a new custom device, which I'd rather not do
for something that seems so trivial.
Furthermore, since /proc doesn't contain _real_ files, but auto-created
ones, presumably a select on a /proc entry would be disappointing.
Anybody have any other good ideas? This will be really cool when I
get it working. :) Please CC me directly on replies, since I am not
currently subscribed.
 -Erik
