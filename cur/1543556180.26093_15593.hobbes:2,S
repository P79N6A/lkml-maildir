	I have similar problems, though I don't have any carrier problems:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:A0:C9:66:12:9B  
          inet addr:xx.xx.xx.xx  Bcast:xx.xx.xx.xx  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:214835 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:33050 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:100 
          Interrupt:9 Base address:0xe0e0 
	Seems to just drop out when there hasn't been any activity for
a while for me though.  Give it about 10-15 seconds and it comes back.

Linux junior 2.2.17-raid #1 Wed Nov 8 07:48:57 EST 2000 i686 unknown
	I didn't run this machine very long w/ 2.2.16 so I don't really
know if previous versions had the same problem.  If I have some time,
perhaps over the weekend, I'll try and find out.
