Yes, in that case this 'do while' doesn't make sense. But this is very
unlikely, sigaction() shouldn't be called too much often, better to save
a couple of bytes from icache.
Also, please note that sigaction() is not special, almost any system call
could be started with
	if (current->signal->flags & SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT)
		return ANYVALUE;
to "optimize" for the case when the task is dying.
