Ok, so how many instructions was added by this ?  Or is it
just in the init code ?  What else just add 'just another
one or two instructions' to common paths because of this?
Which ever way, the point I and some of the others (besides the
additional one from the embedded guys) want to make, is if I
select the CPU to be Pentium4, it means I want a kernel that is
optimised for my P4, without extra crap that I do not need.  Sure,
its an extra instruction here, two there, etc - but when will it
be too much ?  Is this not maybe the fabled 'slight slowdown' that
so many  people complain about from round the 2.5.[67]'s ?
Ok, so maybe my opinion about X86_GENERIC is not as intended, but
then IMHO, it should be 'fixed'.  I could not care less if my kernel
only boot just on my box, never mind on another P4 - I just want
the most optimised on possible.  Sure, some guys want a more generic
kernel - get X86_GENERIC to work for them.  Same for distro's.
I have long wondered if everything in arch/i386/kernel/cpu/ is
really linked in (meaning with no #ifdef as it now looks to be
at a quick peek), or if it was just easier to link them all,
but have non generic stuff (amd/cyrix/whatever specific code)
filtered by ifdef's.
This is just me, but why then don't we then just drop the specific
arch selection, and just have generics instead of pulling a sock
over the user's eyes ?
Thanks,
