The question is about what to do if you got a message to root@[10.0.0.1]
through a socket with local address (getsockname()) being 192.193.194.165.
If the local address is 10.0.0.1 also, there is no problem, the message is
clearly for your MTA.
Technically, Andi proposed to do route lookup at the moment of receiving the
message to check if it's local.
It provides a very close approximation to whether the address is "local" from
the point of view of networking engine.
But I'm not convinced that it's what you really want and need to check.

Right.
But how do you check for the destination IP being in the "local ones"?
Will I get this error if I type a message to root@[127.0.0.2] in a telnet
session to your MTA with 127.0.0.3 source address?
BTW, does ZMailer listen on INADDR_ANY by default?
There are different acceptable solutions.
If the message is delivered to root in the above example, it may be ok.
If I get an error, some people may agree to live with that, not sure about
Wietse :-)
Peter told us how he checked for local addresses in autofs, and that's what
may be done at the sending time in MTAs.
Alternatively, you may connect to port 25 on the target and by some "magic"
way determine that you talk to yourself.
But again I'm unsure if that's what you want and need to check.
The absolutely error-prone solution would be to listen on one specific IP
address and handle this address and only it as local in destinations.
That's how mail works on my own system now :-)
But it isn't very flexible.
My suggestion was to allow the administrator to list "local" IP addresses in
the configuration file, for example, in terms of prefixes, like 127.0.0.0/8
and 192.193.194.165/32.  It's a policy not technical decision, anyway.
If the MTA listens on INADDR_ANY, you should list all addresses connection to
which lead to socket lookup on this system, i.e. all "local" addresses from
the networking configuration's point of view.
If the MTA listens on specific addresses, list them.
The configuration file syntax may be optimized whatever way you want, but the
idea is clear.
The advantages are:
 1. MTA never makes mistakes in what addresses to consider as "local"
 2. you can have several different MTA on the same system
 3. you can have policies which addresses to accept connections on, and it
    won't cause any problems in mail delivery.
