Here is the graph for:
- 2.6.17-rc3 + splice reada fix (vanilla-no-gang)
vs
- 2.6.17-rc3 + splice reada fix + gang lookup (vanilla)
vs
- 2.6.17-rc3 + splice reada fix + lockless page cache (lockless-no-gang)
Average of 3 runs graphed, the lockless run didn't use the batch lookup
as that is a lot slower since it basically defeats the purpose of the
lockless page cache until Nick patches it up :-)
Conclusion: the gang lookup makes things faster for the vanilla kernel,
but it only makes it scale marginally (if at all) better.
