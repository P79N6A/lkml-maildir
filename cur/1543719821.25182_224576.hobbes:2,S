Well it's sane only if you think that USB descriptors can be sane :)
Anyway, this loop will always terminate as we have a finite sized USB
descriptor that this function is parsing.  As to how many times we will
recurse, I don't really know as I haven't spent much time looking into
the different messed up USB audio devices out there on the market...
Sorry I can't be of more help, but I don't think you need to worry about
this function.
thanks,
