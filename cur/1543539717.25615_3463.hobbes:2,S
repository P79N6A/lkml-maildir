Hi all,
  this night, my NFS server partially stopped working. One of its soft raid5
arrays gave many error messages when trying to access it and all involved
processes stayed in D state. So I rebooted the server and the raid array
refused to be set up because I have 3 different time stamps on my 3 disks !!!
I don't know how this is possible, and I don't know what to do. I've tried
to manually change a timestamp, but the raid superblock is after 2G and my
dd can't seek to it (and I can't remember where I found one which uses
llseek). So before destroying it totally, I'd like to know if there's a
good method to recover from sort of these problems, because if not, I wonder
if finally raid5 is such solid  :-/
for info, I'm using a 2.2.17pre11 kernel with ingo's raid-2.2.16, reiserfs
3.5.23 and other stuff so I admit this can come from my kernel, but I still
don't understand how !
Thanks for your help, I'd like to avoid to restore a one week backup.
Willy
