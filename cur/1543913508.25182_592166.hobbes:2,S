Andi,
Here is an annalysis of the results I sent you yesterday (I guess you 
don't have enoguh time to look at everything):
ref code:
1) since /proc/sys/kernel/msgmni has been set to 32768, vmalloc(0x20014) 
is called to allocate the entries[] array (see grow_ary() --> 
ipc_rcu_alloc()).
==>
Before msg queues allocation:  VmallocUsed = 2860 kB
After msg queues allocation:   VmallocUsed = 2996 KB
Once allocated this array is never freed.
Unfortunately, in the result I sent you yesterday, you can't see the 
evolution since it was not the 1st time I was running the test, so the 
vmalloc() has not been called.
2) Since 32768 msg queues have been created and a msg_queue structure <
PAGE_SIZE, kmalloc(0x6C) is called 32768 times
==> size-128 in slabinfo: (I slighty simplified the output to make it 
fit in the mail):
                               objs          slabs
          # name   <active>  <num> <size> : <active> <num>
before : size-128     1070   1320    128 :       44    44
after  : size-128    33840  33840    128 :     1128  1128
patched code:
1) since 32768 msg queues are created, idr_pre_get() is called 32768 times
==> idr_layer_cache in slabinfo:
                                         objs          slabs
          # name           <active>  <num> <size> : <active> <num>
before : idr_layer_cache       112    116    136 :        4     4
after  : idr_layer_cache      1189   1189    136 :       41    41
2) This point remains unchanged compared to the ref code.

Nadia
