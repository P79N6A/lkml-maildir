similar behavior at boot, at least since test11, to wit: at boot: 
prompt, hitting tab causes what seems to be several pages of 
scrolling with the odd character here and there, in place of a list 
of available boot options. after several seconds, boot: prompt 
reappears as usual, and one may, if one has remembered their names, 
type in any of the possibilities, and boot that choice.
