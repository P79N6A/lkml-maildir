People who need the computer to _speak_ names need language or
phonetic information attached to a name, for it to be spoken properly.
On this, Alex Belits has a good point.  It's all very well
standardising on UTF-8 so every name can be displayed nicely.  That is
incomplete for a user who needs "ls" to work audibly, though.
In practice, such a user configures their machine to assume a
particular language, or guess it with bias to the one they use most often.
That is, in some ways, the same problem as having a mixture of
filenames in an unknown character encoding, except that UTF-8 doesn't
solve it.
