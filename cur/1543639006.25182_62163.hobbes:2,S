Hi Richard!
This whole argument is useless anyway. The ethtool API already allows
userland apps to change the eeprom, so you can already change the MAC
address (which I also believe is the way it should be, because that allows
manufacturers to program the MAC address without requiring additional
drivers).
People don't like to break their hardware for the fun of it. You don't see
people reprogramming their memory eeproms using the i2c code, but the
functionality is there. I think ripping out all kinds of functionality just
because there is a slight chance of some stupid person trashing his/her
hardware is unproductive and contrary to the spirit of open and free software.
