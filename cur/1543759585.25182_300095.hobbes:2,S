Subject: [PATCH] FAT: Support synchronous updates

received duplicated email, sorry.]
Hi,
These patches adds the `-o sync' and `-o dirsync' supports to fatfs.
If user specified that option, the fatfs does traditional ordered
updates by using synchronous writes.  If compared to before, these
patches will show a improvement of robustness I think.
`-o sync'    - writes all buffers out before returning from syscall.
`-o dirsync' - writes the directory's metadata, and unreferencing
               operations of data block.
    remaining to be done
         fat_generic_ioctl(), fat_notify_change(),
	 ATTR_ARCH of fat_xxx_write[v],
	 and probably, filling hole in cont_prepare_write(),
NOTE: Since fatfs doesn't have link-count, unfortunately ->rename() is
not safe order at all.  It may make the shared blocks, but user
shouldn't lose the data by ->rename().
Please apply.
