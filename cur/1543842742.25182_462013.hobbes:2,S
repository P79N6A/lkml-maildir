I must say that having an unreliable early-current is going to be quite a
pita for evermore.  Things like mcount-based tricks and
basic-block-profiling-based tricks, for example.
Is it really going to be too messy to fake up some statically-defined gdt
which points at init_task, install that before we call any C at all?
