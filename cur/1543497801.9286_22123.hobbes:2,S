I just want to let people know that a IEEE 1394 (aka FireWire)
subsystem for Linux is under development by me (including a TI PCILynx
chip driver), just in case anybody else considers starting his own.  I
know of Emanuel Pirker's attempt of writing a subsystem but this got
nowhere, so I started my own.
I've been working on that for some time now, it actually got pretty
far.  The subsystem runs fine and responds to outside requests.  Things
that are not tested yet are outgoing transactions.  Things that don't
even exist yet are any interface to user space and a real bus manager
implementation.  And drivers for the Adaptec chip and OHCI chips.
Question:  When should it be included in the 2.3 series?  Should it
mature a bit first more or be included it now?  (It ain't no
development release if it doesn't contain unfinished code.)
Note: the patches on my homepage are not really current.  Oh, and I
only tested it in module form so far.
