I do agree it only does something which we do manually with a lot of the 
other members, however i'm not quite sure wether the compatibility thing 
still holds since a number of drivers have a lot of 2.5 specific stuff 
(e.g. pci-dma api changes). Regardless, here is a typical use in a 
netdriver.
	/* dev and dev->priv zeroed in alloc_etherdev */
	dev = alloc_etherdev (sizeof (*tp));
	if (dev == NULL) {
		printk (KERN_ERR PFX "%s: Unable to alloc new net device\n", pdev->slot_name);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}
	SET_MODULE_OWNER(dev);
	tp = dev->priv;
	
	/* followed by ... */
	dev->foo = __foo;
	dev->bar = __bar;
