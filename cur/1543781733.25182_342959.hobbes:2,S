  What kernel are you using?
  Can you do some form of a crash dump (maybe some diskdump thing)? 
It is hard to debug without insturmentation of some kind....  You are
most likely going to have to rebuild/change your current kernel to
sort this issue out....

  How do you know you are spinning on some inode semaphore?  If the
system is only headless how do you know you are dealing with some
priority inversion issue?  Maybe the system has a panic or ????
  It seems to me you might be jumping to conclusions.

  From the present state you have described you would be unable to
load a module or interact with the box in anyway. It is really hard to
debug a kernel without a console.  As others have suggested a serial
console/net console would help a bunch.
Good luck!
