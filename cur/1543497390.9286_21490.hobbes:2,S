Hello all,
I was just reviewing 
http://www.mentat.com/xtp/xtp.html
 and
http://www.ca.sandia.gov/xtp/.
 XTP looks like a very interesting protocol. 
It provides all the features of TCP, plus built-in realiable multicasts, better
speed over networks with packet loss, better speed overall, maximum bandwidth
limiting built-in, and a few other features which make it noteworthy.
It appears that they have defined a few protocols over XTP already, including
SMTP and FTP. 
Is there any projects out there to add XTP to the standard linux kernel?
Jordan
