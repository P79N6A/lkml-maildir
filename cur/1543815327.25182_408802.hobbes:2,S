I just noticed this whilst booting 2.6.16 on a test box
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_ptr_read
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_synth_copy_from_user
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_voice_free
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_synth_free
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_ptr_write
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_synth_bzero
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_voice_alloc
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_memblk_map
snd_emu10k1_synth: Unknown symbol snd_emu10k1_synth_alloc
This kernel was configured with CONFIG_SND_EMU10K1=m
and CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER=m
This looks like it can't possibly work, unless I change
CONFIG_SND_EMU10K1 to =y.  Is exporting a symbol from one
module to another actually supposed to work?
I thought this was why we had the ill-fated intermodule_register() ?.
