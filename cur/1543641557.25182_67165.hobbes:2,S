As a user (for the sake of argument) i don't want to see an
uneccesary proliferation of interfaces.  There is no reason
why the interface cannot be made policy aware from the
beginning even if it starts out only supporting the one
policy of fixed.
Something like 'echo "fixed 500M" >/proc/cpu/freak'
would allow the addition of new policies without having to
add new interfaces.  Notice that i give the policy as the
first parameter.  Each policy should register itself with
its callbacks (read, write, ?).
Probably should have a something like /proc/filesystems
that reports supported policies since supportable
policies would vary according to hardware + emulation.
