That one probably should be a KERN_DEBUG and not KERN_INFO (or simply
not reported unless #define DEBUG or similar in the driver).

That one doesn't have a KERN_XXX at all but according to the comments
the card commonly interrupts twice for one event.

The info from "cat /proc/net/dev" is more informative.  Also note
that no error counters are incremented for the "no status" message.

These cards have been problematic since the introduction of a
linux driver (hence the experimental status).  Quite a few people
have had a go at hacking the driver but the consensus is that the
i82586 databook isn't detailed enough to allow a reliable driver
to be coded that handles all the quirks.
In short if you have a $2 ISA ne2000 card kicking about it will
probably provide more reliable operation.  If not then try setting
your ISA bus to conservative settings (8MHz, default wait states 
etc.)  Some people have reported the complete hack of s/outb/outb_p/
on the whole driver to have helped against lock-up problems, FWIW.
