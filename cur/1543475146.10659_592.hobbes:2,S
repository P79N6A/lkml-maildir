http://www.onsale.com
 has been selling some new and refurbished Alpha
boxes.

Start at the new Alphalinux web site; 
http://www.alphalinux.org
.  Also see
the axp-list@redhat.com mailing list.  A wonderful group of (very
knowledgeable) people discussing Linux/AXP.

Not really, but you will be able to answer that for yourself after doing
some research for a while.  I'd suggest checking out all the websites,
reading all the FAQ's and HOWTO's, and joining the mailing list at least 1
week before you purchase an Alpha.

You can currently buy low-end multias (an older "pizza-box"-size net-PC
type Alpha) for under a $100.  I bought an AlphaStation 200 from onsale.com
for under $400 US (sans disk, monitor, keyboard).
