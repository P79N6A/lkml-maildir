My apologies, I found a logic error in free_all_bootmem_core() which
was not triggered during testing, but deserves correction, in addition
to a leak introduced during verbosity reduction. Without
CONFIG_KERNEL_HACKING the segment pool would be leaked, and also
free_bootmem_core() may invalidate the value of
pgdat->bdata->segment_tree.length_tree read prior to calling it.
This fix was tested on i386.
