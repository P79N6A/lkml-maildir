Nothing is wrong with this case.  Jiffies is guarenteed to be greater
than or equal to "now".  There is no need to cast it to a signed type.
Let me say this again, in another way :-)
	SOME_WRAPPED_AROUND_SMALL_VALUE
	MINUS
	SOME_HUGE_ABOUT_TO_WRAP_AROUND_VALUE
will have the same result, signed or not.  Check this out!
(gdb) p (long)0x2 - (long)0xfffffff8
$1 = 10
(gdb) p (unsigned long)0x2 - (unsigned long)0xfffffff8
$2 = 10
It's math and the computer comfirms it! :-)))
Please show me a failure case for this statement if you disagree
with me.

These cases are indeed buggy.  I'd rather fix these ones with
time_{after,before}() though.  And again, your "signed" casts
are totally superfluous.
Franks a lot,
