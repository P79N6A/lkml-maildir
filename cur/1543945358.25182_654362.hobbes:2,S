kgdb was never expected to be any better than using a sysrq-b.   Unless
you put some really ugly code in to deal with lots of edge cases there
are certainly times it is just going to force you to press the power
button.  If there is a better function for "reset now and cross fingers"
kgdb can be changed easily enough to do that.
Also given that you can have more than one type of "R" packet it would
be easy enough to add other reboot types, such as an R1 which might call
to the bios or another means to reset.  For now the intent is pretty
clear and there is not likely a need to expand the scope.
