Or, you could define an X86_32 config symbol in i386. This seems a
little more backward compatible, and means that you can continue to
just test X86 for the rather large set of code that works fine on both
32-bit and 64-bit.
I guess it depends on whether you think there are more places in the
generic code that the two architectures share code, vs places that are
32-bit only.
