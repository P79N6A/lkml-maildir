It has less to do with lock contention and much more to do with the
design of the tty / console layer.  It isn't the kernel's prettiest
code.
There is probably some cleanup that is possible, but really getting the
thing in gear (which means no BKL, which is probably the hardest part to
rip out) require some level of rewrite.
