I don't have sound on this machine, so I don't get any errors in this module.

I used the same quick-hack, but I was wondering why kmap_types.h is missing... 
Any ideas? Anybody?

The same problems happens here. I'm currently searching for the changelog for 
do_fork, so I may find out what arguments I should add to make this working 
again. At the i386-tree there is sometimes "NULL" as the last argument added, 
but I don't believe that it will be good to simply add "NULL" in every 
function call. :o)
Also the quick hack with kmap_types.h doesn't seem very nice to me, but I just 
tried to compile it fine for the first...
Any suggestions from anyone are very welcome! :o)
