I still have no opinion about your proposal for implementing CLONE_CRED.
What I fail to see is why you appear to insist it would be
incompatible with the idea of copy-on-write VFS credentials (which I
explained are interesting for other purposes).
I also fail to understand why you insist that we need to drop the idea
of copy-on-write credentials in order to optimize for this fringe case
in which somebody calls sys_access() or exec with euid != fsuid.
Now repeat after me
  "changing fsuid/fsgid is *not* the common case that needs optimization."
