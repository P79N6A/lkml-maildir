Hi... I saw your post in the lkml archives (I'm not subscribed either).  I think I'm having either a very similar problem, or the same problem that you are.
Similarities:
	Can't mount root, kernel panic
	Only happening in 2.5.62-ac1 (I haven't tried any other 2.5.6x kernels)
Differences:
	Using IDE root disc
	Using devfs
	root, which contains /boot, is ext3
I think something about device handling may have changed which is causing this problem. (for me, devfs started needing a root= option since about 2.5.50).  Additionally, when the kernel panics, does it specify the correct major/minor device number?  Mine uses the wrong one unless I use rdev, and then panics with the correct one (/dev/hda2, 0x0302)
These are the relevant entries in grub's menu.lst:
timeout 5
default 0
title   2.5.62 ac1
root    (hd0,1)
kernel  /boot/kernel/62.5.2k-ac1 root=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2
title   2.5.51
root    (hd0,1)
kernel  /boot/kernel/51.5.2k-br root=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2
the second entry works fine, but the first entry panics and gives me the same message you described.
