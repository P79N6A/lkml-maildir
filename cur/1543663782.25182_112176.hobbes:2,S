Hello all,
I am experiencing a weird problem with ide-scsi. I try to do a simple CD mount
with above kernel versions. This results in spinning up cdrom drive, then
increasing cpu load and about 1 minute after that a complete freeze of the
system. To be honest I am not really sure if I am doing something wrong, but
cannot image what that could be.
I tried simple "mount /dev/sr0 /mnt" -> spinup, then freeze, "mount /dev/scd0
/mnt" -> spinup, then freeze. I even tried attaching a real SCSI cdrom, which
works as expected. I tried booting a live filesystem directly from the
questionable drive, it works (obviously does not use ide-scsi, but atapi). I
tried another ATAPI cdrom (first acer, then LiteOn), freeze. So it is no
hardware problem.
After beating this unbelievable problem for 5 hours I am now out-of-ideas. 
Any hints welcome.
