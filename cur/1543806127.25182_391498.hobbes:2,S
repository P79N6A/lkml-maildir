Sure there is lesson here.  People have a tendency to resist change, even 
though they know the current way is faulty.

Why would you think that the shortest path between two points is complicated, 
when you have the ability to fly?

You are hitting the nail right on it's head here.
Nothing moves the masses like mass-production.
So with 64bits widely available now, and to let Linux spread its wings and 
really fly, how could tmpfs merged w/ swap be tweaked to provide direct 
mapped access into this linear address space?
Thanks!
