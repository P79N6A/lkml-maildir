Does this race really justify extra locks?  AFAICT the worst case is
that a user can go slightly over their RLIMIT_NPROC, and that will only
occur if they fork on multiple cpus "at the same time".  Given the
timing constraints on that small window, I would be surprised if this
race could be exploited to gain more than a couple of extra processes.
This looks like a case where close enough is good enough.
