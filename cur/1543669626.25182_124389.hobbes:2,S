Is there a special reason why you call mknod?
Otherwise you could simply do:
	syscall(SYS_mknod, name, S_IFBLK | mode, dev); 
This way you don't have to care about major/minor/glibc issues.

To help serialization and perfomance issues, it might help to add a daemon 
mode to hotplug. The kernel calls hotplug with a pipe from which it reads 
the event data, after a certain timeout it can close the pipe and exit.
