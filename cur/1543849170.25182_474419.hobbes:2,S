That seems to be a 16MB memory resource. But we already totally filled up 
the memory space we reserved for cardbus with the memory resources needed 
for 7:0.0 and 7:0.1
That cardbus card seems to have three sub-functions, and it looks like 
they _all_ want a 16MB memory region. We "only" allocated 32MB total for 
it, so the third subfunction gets left out.
(There's another 32MB of memory allocated for the cardbus bridge at 
0x6a000000, but it's prefetchable, so we don't allow a non-prefetchable 
resourc to use it).
I don't think this has _ever_ worked. 
Hmm. I guess the Alvaro could try increasing "BRIDGE_MEM_MAX" in 
drivers/pcmcia/yenta_socket.c. It's currently at 4MB, but I think we gave 
him 32MB exactly because there was a huge memory hole, so we decided to 
extend it further a bit:
                size = BRIDGE_MEM_MAX;
                if (size > avail/8) {
                        size=(avail+1)/8;
                        /* round size down to next power of 2 */
                        i = 0;
                        while ((size /= 2) != 0)
                                i++;
                        size = 1 << i;
                }
but it migth be worth testing with "BRIDGE_MEM_MAX" set to 64MB instead of 
the current 4MB.
Alvaro?
