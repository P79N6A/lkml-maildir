If it doesn't it seems the compression feature is going to be rather
unpredictable and my optimization would be perfectly within spec and
make it pretty much useless.

That would make it tricky to say if you should ever skip compression due
to cpu load.  There is a chance cpu load would be better off by doing
the compression.
