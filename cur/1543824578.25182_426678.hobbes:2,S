In general, I like the cleanup.  See comments below.

I'm not following your change here.  I can't find the problem you
mention in the original code.  And your fix appears to mess up the
printed_len.

Here you subtract from the printed_len to account for skipping
the submitted log level.

But here you don't re-count the chars for the log-level
you are adding back in.  There's a discrepancy here.
Please look at this again.  NAK
