I agree with you here. 
Maybe there are some confusion of mixing up the spi_trasnfer.speed_hz
with the spi_device.max_speed_hz.
spi_device.max_speed_hz comes from spi_board_info.max_speed_hz, it is
for the default max speed value.
spi_transfer.speed_hz comes from upper applications for each spi
transfer setting.
Am I right?
I will fix this later.

OK, we will test this on our hardware.
