This reminds me of good ole IDE:  the first-generation SATA controllers 
carry forward the limits of the older PCI IDE controllers:  neither the 
S/G table nor any single S/G entry may span a 64K boundary.
In theory the block layer / SCSI layer DMA boundary stuff takes care of 
this -- but iommu merging _undoes_ the segment splitting that the 
hardware _requires_.  Thus, in ata_fill_sg in libata-core.c, I re-split 
the S/G list after DMA-mapping it.  A bit lame.
James and BenH discussed a solution at the DMA level, but I don't think 
anything ever happened.
