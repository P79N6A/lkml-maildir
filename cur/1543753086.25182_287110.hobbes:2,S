We now have:
swlab155:/usr/src/linux-2.6.10-gold # grep version.h -rI . | wc -l
2143
swlab155:/usr/src/linux-2.6.10-gold # grep UTS_RELEASE -rIi .| wc -l
47
So it appears that its much simpler to change all users of
UTS_RELEASE to use some other file, say local_version.h,
and have localversion not affect version.h
Opinions?
