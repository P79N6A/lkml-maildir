Thanks for the pointer.

Am I right assuming lat_ctx -s 0 2 spawns two threads that only ping pong
all the time at maximal rate on a pipe to benchmark the speed of
schedule() (not the behaviour of the SMP scheduler!)? Such bench is single
threaded, the pipe don't even use the normal wakeup but it only calls
schedule() strightforward so I don't think my changes can affect such a
benchark. Maybe I am missing something...
Anyway in general I don't mind to have a some usec slower SMP wakeup
latency for interactive tasks if very CPU intensive tasks gets improved a
lot by my changes (thus global performances improves). Here the numbers
about my changes:

I believe Linux is going to be used a lot for very CPU intensive
computation/simulation and I care very much to not waste CPU power by
trahsing the caches all the time.

I'll check ASAP. (Dimitris if you'll check too please take me in CC so we
won't duplicate efforts ;).

Probably. But it doesn't seems to me that the lat_ctx can be caused by my
reschedule_idle changes since the wakeup shouldn't happen in first place
there.
Just and idea maybe it's the wakeup_sync thing that harms lat_ctx? It
shouldn't but that would be at least an obvious change in the path run by
the lat_ctx bench. But that's not a 2.3.4x change IIRC.
