Actually, no we haven't :)
We punt on the "do we remove the driver when the device disappears"
issue, and instead ignore the hotplug REMOVE events right now.
So far, no one's complained.
But to unplug all of the devices in the system in the proper order,
you're probably going to have to use the driverfs tree that is slowly
taking shape.  That's the only representation of all physical devices in
the system that shows the topology correctly.
Hope this helps,
