I think this is just to due missing oss (emulation) drivers. It's
snd_pcm_oss and snd_mixer_oss IIRC.
Anyway that "sounds" :) weired: There might be a mixer be muted or some
bobo with the driver.
I just looked into /proc/asound/cardX/pcm0p/sub0/status and it shows
progress when playing -- This _might_ mean that alsa is working. Did the
same on the box with the Live! now and got little bit lost by the amount
of channels, but it seems to be the same /pcm0p/sub0/status there.
