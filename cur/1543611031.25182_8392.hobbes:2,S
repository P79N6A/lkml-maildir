That certainly seems to be the usual way to do release candidates. For
ongoing enhancement, there can either be a freeze while the -rcN process
is happening, or the next -pre fixes can go against -rc1.
Example:
2.4.20-pre5 -> 2.4.20-rc1 -> 2.4.20-rc2 -(becomes)-> 2.4.20
                   \
              (also called)
                     \
                      \__ 2.4.21-pre0 -> 2.4.21-pre1 -> 2.4.21-pre2 -> ...
It all depends on the choice of the maintainer between holding off
addition of changes and slight increases in version numbering. Alan Cox
sort of "alternates," his releases are stable unless the ChangeLog says
otherwise. I've been using his release as "really stable" for some time,
although now I need patches which are never going to make it into the main
kernel AFAIK.
