I claim that SOCK_RAW allows write() after bind()
because a few days ago I changed dosemu code
to use SOCK_RAW instead of SOCK_PACKET and write()
instead of sendto(). See here:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/dosemu/dosemu/src/dosext/net/net/libpacket.c?r1=1.4&r2=1.5&diff_format=u
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/dosemu/dosemu/src/dosext/net/net/pktnew.c?r1=1.7&r2=1.8&diff_format=u
Of course the fact that I did that for dosemu,
doesn't mean that I was doing the right thing
(so if you know it is wrong - I'll redo it)
but at least it was tested and works.
And since that works for SOCK_RAW, I don't
see any reasons for it to not work for
SOCK_PACKET. And btw, I can use read() quite
happily even with SOCK_PACKET, so why not
write()...
My patch is simply an adoption of the code
SOCK_RAW has. See af_packet.c:packet_sendmsg(),
you'll see under "if (saddr == NULL)" just the
same code as I was doing for SOCK_PACKET.
