    Was the other report by private email?
Yes. Mark McPherson wrote:
  I have an Archos Jukebox Recorder 20 which has never been
  re-formatted since I purchased it.  It fails to mount under 2.6 with
  the same report as the flash card, and also mounts successfully under 2.4.
  Patching around the code as you suggested allows it to mount without
  complaint under 2.6.
  Win2K thinks this file system is just fine.
