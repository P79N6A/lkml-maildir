- Linus has merged per-zone-lru and per-zone-lock, so the NUMA guys should
  be less than totally grumpy for several milliseconds.
- Linus has merged tlb-speedup.  There are new stats in /proc/meminfo
  which boast about how many global tlb invalidations have been saved.
  These will disappear soon.
- The hashed rmap spinlocking patch has been shown to slow down the big
  NUMA machines, and was of marginal benefit for SMP, and it added complexity.
  It has been shuffled to apply after rmap-speedup and the highpte patch.
  So it has basically been dropped.  Daniel is cooking up something else.
+ A BUG_ON(page_count(page)) has been added to put_page_testzero()
  (per Daniel's suggestion).  Should catch the possible double-free
  of LRU pages.
+ pagevec_lru_del() is removed
+ a change to the refill_inactive logic suggested by Ed Tomlinson
+ Janet Morgan's patch which speeds up readv&writev for O_DIRECT is
  included.  It needs some interface changes yet - generic_file_read
  and generic_file_write should be changed to take an iovec, which will
  allow lots of code to be removed.
+ Ed Tomlinson's slablru patch is now included.  This puts slab pages
  onto the LRU in an attempt to balance the various caches against
  other demands on the page allocator.   Seems to work nicely from a
  quick test.  It is early days for this code.
  I added a field to /proc/meminfo which displays the total amount of
  slab memory.
+ pte_highmem is still included, but it has mysteriously broken itself.
  Don't enable this in config.
  pte_highmem touches all architectures in possibly injurious ways.  It
  would be helpful if it received some non-x86 testing, please.  Just the
  "does it compile and boot" test.
2.5.32-mm2 hasn't had a ton of stability testing....
