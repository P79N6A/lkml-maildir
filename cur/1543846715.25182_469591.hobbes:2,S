Change app to use sync_file_range() followed by
posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED).  Problem solved.
We have lots of nice new tools in-kernel which permit applications to
manipulate and to invalidate pagecache.  Please, start using them rather
than pushing bits of oracle into the core vfs ;)

That is strange, because the truncate_inode_pages() will throw away the
dirty pagecache pages which the application just wrote to.  Maybe the file
was opened O_SYNC or something.

Please, no truncate_inode_pages.  For this application, the far-safer
invalidate_inode_pages() would suffice.
However no kernel change is needed.
And no sneaking changes like this into vendor kernels either!  Fix Oracle.
