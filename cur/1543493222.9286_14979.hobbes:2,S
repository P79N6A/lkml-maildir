I've always agreed with the BugTrax comment I saw aeons ago that
pointed out that scripts are subject to so many security holes that
they should NEVER be given extra facilities. For this reason, I have
no sympathy at all with any argument for giving extra rights to
scripts in ANY circumstances, and certainly I've yet to meet a valid
reason for doing so...
Best wishes from Riley.
