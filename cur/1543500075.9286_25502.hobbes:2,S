Jeff, if your filesystem is supposed to work with 2.0 you are in for a
*BIG* work when you will port it to 2.2. Sorry, but It's Your Problem(tm).
VFS changed big way and keeping the same codebase is next to impossible.
Exactly because 2.0 was much dumber. If your design decisions are based on
2.0 - too bad, the thing will suck badly.
