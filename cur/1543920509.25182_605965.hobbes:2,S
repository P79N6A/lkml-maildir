Added Cc:lkml, perhaps someone at VIA could find that strictly
confidential and destroy-before-reading document and spare me
the effort? :-)
All I need to know is:
a) meaning of the config EEPROM data for VIA firewire chips
b) how to read/write the EEPROM from PCI side (i.e., probably
EECS, EEDO, EEDI/SDA and EECK/SCL bit locations or however
it's done).
