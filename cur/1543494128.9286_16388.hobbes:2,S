well, there was 16Mb soldered on the processor board, so now, there are 80Mb.

hum, they work well on another machine.

it's said in the doc that they are.

no way, they are all the same, same date..

can't remove the old... can't disable them.

cannot do that, the compaq icu is really anoying..

cannot do that either.

well, the mainboard is quite old, (10/95)..
so, i'll keep it like this.
You didn't answered all my question, what does NMI means, and do i risk
something if i let it like this ?
