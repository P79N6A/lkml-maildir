Even in the presence of non-executable stack, Linux Torvalds explains 
that "It's really easy. You do something like this: 1) overflow the 
buffer on the stack, so that the return value is overwritten by a 
pointer to the system() library function. 2) the next four bytes are 
crap (a "return pointer" for the system call, which you don't care 
about) 3) the next four bytes are a pointer to some random place in the 
shared library again that contains the string "/bin/sh" (and yes, just 
do a strings on the thing and you'll find it). Voila. You didn't have to 
write any code, the only thing you needed to know was where the library 
is loaded by default. And yes, it's library-specific, but hey, you just 
select one specific commonly used version to crash. Suddenly you have a 
root shell on the system. So it's not only doable, it's fairly trivial 
to do. In short, anybody who thinks that the non-executable stack gives 
them any real security is very very much living in a dream world. It may 
catch a few attacks for old binaries that have security problems, but 
the basic problem is that the binaries allow you to overwrite their 
stacks. And if they allow that, then they allow the above exploit. It 
probably takes all of five lines of changes to some existing exploit, 
and some random program to find out where in the address space the 
shared libraries tend to be loaded."
