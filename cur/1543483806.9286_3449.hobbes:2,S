eh?  just where are these packets originating from?  you've not turned on
ip forwarding already have you?

i was pondering whether someone might make this point whilst i was out
at lunch!  my response is that we are discussing the routing functions of
a general purpose OS.  there is no reason why they should work differently
from they way they might on a dedicated router.  the router is probably
doing it the right way.  would it not makes sense to try to emulate the
routers way of doing things?  (it also occurred to that both teltrend's
network iq series routers and bay's nautica products add the directly
attached interfaces routes automatically too)
Cheers,
