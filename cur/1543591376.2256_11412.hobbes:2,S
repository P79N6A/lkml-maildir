If you have a local makefile with which you wish to build your module 
not linked under the kernel tree in the proper way, you still can
"ride" on the master Makefile.
This way one can eliminate the dependency on your particular 
machine kernel compilation options to be hardwired in the local Makefile.
I.e., once you reconfigure the kernel, your driver will compile
itself when you do a local "make" with the correct set of the new flags.
This is what you can do on 2.2 (Makefile excerpt follows):
EXTRA_CFLAGS := -DDEBUG -DLINUX -I/usr/src/foo/include
MI_OBJS  := your-module.o
O_TARGET := your-module.o
O_OBJS   := your1.o your2.o
# Reuse Linux kernel master makefile on this directory
ifdef MAKING_MODULES
include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make
else
all::
        cd '/usr/src/linux' && make modules SUBDIRS=$(PWD)
endif
In 2.4 the syntax is different. Rename
MI_OBJS to obj-m and O_OBJS to obj-y to achieve the same goal there:
obj-m  := your-module.o
O_TARGET := your-module.o
obj-y   := your1.o your2.o
