yep. I'm too in favor of keeping the need-lockbreak mechanism and its 
type-insensitive data structure. We've got way too many locking 
primitives and keeping them all sorted is nontrivial already. I wouldnt 
mind seeing the need_lockbreak flag move into one of the high bits of 
spinlocks though, to compress size.
