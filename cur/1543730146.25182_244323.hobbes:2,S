I'm in the process of writing a driver for a SD/MMC card reader. Since 
this is the first driver I'm writing I'm having some difficulties 
fitting it into the linux driver model. I've read all the documentation 
I can find to no avail.
The device is attached to the LPC bus and cannot be found using PNP. 
 From what I can gather this driver should therefore be organised under 
the platform bus. I can't figure out how to do this though. I've created 
the device structure, with platform_bus_type at .bus. I've called 
device_register with the structure. Now how to I create a device object 
and attach this to the bus? With PCI I guess this handles itself using 
the PCI id:s.
At the moment I just let the driver play by itself. But that doesn't 
seem to be using the driver model properly.
Any pointers would be helpful. Documentation, functions, example 
drivers, anything.
