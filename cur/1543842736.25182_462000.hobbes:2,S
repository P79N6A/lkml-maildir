Ok, apparently it is my fault...
I traced the failure to
if (cpufreq_driver) {
                spin_unlock_irqrestore(&cpufreq_driver_lock, flags);
                return -EBUSY;
        }
(cpufreq_register_driver in drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c)
Turns out I was modprobing acpi-cpufreq before modprobing cpufreq-k7.
This worked in previous kernels and apparently, not in this one.
If I do not modprobe acpi-cpufreq, it works.
