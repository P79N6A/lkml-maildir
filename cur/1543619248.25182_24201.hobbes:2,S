Ok the oops is not nice. The timeouts point to i2o_scsi and/or the serveraid
in i2o mode not liking one another (it has an official native mode driver
too btw which is the one you wanted)
Can you run the oops through ksymoops so I can see what the symbols are
and I'll take a look. I guess Im mixing a bus/host address somewhere on
the reset command (which just doesnt occur in normal i2o use)
