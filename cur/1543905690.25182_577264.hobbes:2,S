Hello everybody,
here are some small documentation fixes - mostly typing errors.
Please take a look at the last chunk - I think that klibc.bkbits.net 
is no longer the current version, but I'm not sure whether the 
other link is better.
Whom should I CC for other documentation updates? Is the maintainer 
the correct person, or are such small fixes "send and forget"?
Regards,
Phil
