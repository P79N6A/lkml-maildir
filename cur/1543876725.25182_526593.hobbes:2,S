Well, send me the DSDT and dmidecode output (mask off the UUID and serial
numbers), and I will be able to say more.

This is a highly unusual output for thinkpads, but might be the expected one
for your X60, the X-series has always been a bit weird.  I'd higly suggest
asking for X60 thermal data from other X60 owners on the linux-thinkpad ML.
Make sure to state your X60 model number, and to request that everyone does
the same.

Yes, if all sensors are working fine.  That said, people override the EC fan
control all the time, because it seems not to be doing what people want.
Thinkwiki has more on this, and you want to set your fan to level 7 when
doing CPU-intensive work for now, since you are experiencing some sort of
trouble anyway...
