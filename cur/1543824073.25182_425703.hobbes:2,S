no, i think that conclusion is wrong. The FC1 glibc and vdso problems 
*when mixing a FC2 kernel with a FC1 glibc* were due to exec-shield 
enforcing non-exec for the vdso.

this bug has nothing to do with nonexec restrictions. [ Also, this all 
was _years_ and hundreds of bugs ago, when upstream's position was still 
a cocky "who the hell needs protection against overflows" and "go away 
with this non-exec crap" so we were pretty much alone trying to 
introduce those features. So any suggestion of intention on our part 
would be quite unfair. ]
