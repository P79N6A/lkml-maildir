Hi, Andi,
As I dig through this patch, I find it mostly makes sense; seems like it
could be a good idea.  I did have one little API question...
> +struct page *
> +alloc_pages_mask(gfp_t gfp, unsigned size, u64 mask)
> +{
> +	unsigned long max_pfn = mask >> PAGE_SHIFT;
The "mask" parameter isn't really a mask - it's an upper bound on the
address of the allocated memory.  Might it be better to call it
"max_addr" or "limit" or "ceiling" or some such so callers understand
for sure how it's interpreted?  The use of the term "mask" throughout
the interface could maybe create a certain amount of confusion.
Thanks,
jon
