I agree on a purely technical level, but the same could be said about all
the other group ID stuff too, so..
I'll add a gettid(), except I won't be moving reserved system calls
around. I didn't even realize I had removed gettid - it was there in the
2.4.0-test kernels that implemented the signal groups, and I meant to only
revert the unsafe signals stuff..
