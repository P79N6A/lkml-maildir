This is only an example to prove that if an app perform fast switch there is a
higher probability that it touchs few data, and when I say touch I don't mean
only "for(i=0;i<N;i++) touch(data[i]);" but I mean also include I/O operations.
If You fast switch imply that You have a small "time footprint", but to have a
small time footprint You must either load / store few byte or have on both sides
very fast devices.
This does not mean that is always in that way, but, as I've specified in the
previous message, there are a prominent probability.

The TCP/IP layer will split 1Mb into M MTU chunks, but You must wait anyway
to get 1Mb of data. The same for write.
