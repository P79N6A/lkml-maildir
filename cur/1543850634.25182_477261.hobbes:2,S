Feel free to do such a patch yourself, so long as the MII doesn't
go into a separate module.  You'll have to also modify the two
Ethernet adapters currently using that usbnet core code (and MII).
That'd still feel like needless complexity to me, though.  So
unless you're keen on doing that quickly, I'd say to just merge
the two existing patches and be done with it.
