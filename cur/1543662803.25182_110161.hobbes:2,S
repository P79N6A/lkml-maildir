On the ISA COM20020 eval boards from SMC, yes -- that's what my addled
brain seems to recall, and I'm inclined to believe it this time because
com20020.c::com20020_found() still has the following:
        if (!dev->dev_addr[0])
                dev->dev_addr[0] = inb(ioaddr + 8);     /* FIXME: do this some other way! */
