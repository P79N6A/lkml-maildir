Nothing to do with modutils.  Some code marked ___exit is doing a lock
or semaphore operation.  The .text.lock code is trying to call back to
section text.exit but text.exit is discarded when building the kernel.
for i in drivers/char/*.o
do
  objdump -S -r -j .text.lock $i | egrep -B 8 'file format|text\.exit'
done
will list the name of each .o file in drivers/char and pull out any
references from the .text.lock section back to text.exit.  Report which
.o file has a reference to text.exit.
