You are the second person with a Gigabyte motherboard to report this.
We suspect a bad BIOS as the line
> EIP:    0050:[<00008896>]
indicates that the code is being executed out of the BIOS (no the
Linux kernel).  The 0050 is the APM BIOS's 16 bit code segment.  Does
this also crash with previous kernels?
Cheers,
Stephen
