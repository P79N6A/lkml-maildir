Alan,
Apology accepted.  I think you overreacted.  And no, I'd prefer for you
and I to finish what we started -- you told me you would do it -- and I
was not attacking you directly.  If you don't want to work with me on
the clustering projects after NWFS for 2.2 is in -- that's your choice
-- it's not my preference, I like you and have enjoyed wotking with
you.  I have a great deal of respect and admiration for you, Alan, so
get over it and let's get on with life.  I'll shut up now -- Some code
will be ready for you this evening for 2.0.  I have some questions on
2.2 still outstanding.  I will email them to you.
Your Friend (hopefully not Ex)
Jeff
