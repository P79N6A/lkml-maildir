It could just be more available (freed) memleak_objects on one CPU
than on the others and use more memory. Not a big problem though.

At freeing, kmemleak only gets a pointer value which has to be looked
up in the hash table for the corresponding memleak_object. Only after
that, we can know memleak_object->cpu. That's why I think we only need
to have a global hash table. The hash table look-up can be RCU.
It would work with per-CPU hash tables but we still need to look-up
the other hash tables in case the freeing happened on a different CPU
(i.e. look-up the current hash table and, if it fails, look-up the
other per-CPU hashes). Freeing would need to remove the entry from the
hash table and acquire a lock but this would be per-CPU. I'm not sure
how often you get this scenario (allocation and freeing on different
CPUs) but it might introduce an overhead to the memory freeing.
Do you have a better solution here?

That's not that difficult but, as above, we need the hash table
look-up before we find which list it is on.

You are right but I didn't mean that small critical sections are
better, just that in case we need a critical section for the global
hash table look-up, extending this critical region with list
addition/deletion wouldn't make things any worse (than they are,
regarding scalability).
