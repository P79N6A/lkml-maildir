Well, the last time RCU was discussed, Linus said that he would
like to see someplace where RCU clearly helps.
Linus, would you consider this to be such a case and consider
including the rcu_poll patch from aa series of kernels ? It
has been a part of aa kernels for quite a while now. The latest
RCU patches support preemption and AFAICS, new module unloading
and cpu hotplug frameworks can use the RCU synchronize_kernel() 
interface.
Or atleast, we can perhaps discuss RCU and see if there are
potential issues that have not been disected so far.
Thanks
