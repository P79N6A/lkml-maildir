Ummm, on my Dual P-III (650MHz with 524988416 Bytes), my current Seti 
efficiency is 5.35 CpF.   That's a tad high/slower than an Ultra Sparc IIi 
according to their stats.  So, it would appear that being SMP is hurting my 
performance a bit.   Unless that is that you meant to run a seti instance for 
each CPU?   And this reminds me of how "make -j3 bzlilo" is slower than
"make -j2 bzlilo".
