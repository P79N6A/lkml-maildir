this however doesn't offer the protection on the mmap side, but maybe
you limit the amount of mmaps with another logic.

cool, so you're already using this heap-stack-gap API. Then maybe we
could increase the size to more than 1 page. 1 page is the minimum,
infact those apps asking for the feature have to increase it by hand in
/proc.

you recommendation is valid, and this should work, the stack cannot be
read before it's written to. In theory userspace could track the size of
the stack and know it is supposed to be 0 and avoid a potential
memset(0) on local variables the first run, but I don't think gcc is
capable of doing that.
My only worry is that this mess up things with mprotect, I mean I can't
just check only for read-only vmas, I've also to trap when this
read-only vma infact becomes read-write again. So for simplicity of the
implementation I would prefer not to track readonly pages. If you've a
strong reason for tracking readonly pages let me know of course. I think
java already does fine by checking the heap-stack-gap.
