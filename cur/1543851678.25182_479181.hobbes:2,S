You are right. Just now I sent a mail to the administrator of the list and
he told that recently he made fastboot a closed list to avoid spams. But he
is now re-opening the list for everybody as we want to archive the
kexec/kdump related discussions in fastboot list. Finding a past discussion
on LKML is tough.
So now onwards you should not be receiving those annoying messages.
Thanks
Vivek
