there is nothing wrong with using names that have slashes.  The thing

So don't.  Why would user space care how you parse it and whether the
driver or reiserfs does it?

We should distinguish here between names and name components.

I still do not grok why you need to change / to !.
Something is wrong.  Reiserfs is being asked to do something that
somebody else should be doing.
