So essentially when we calculate delta_mine component for each of those
1000 tasks, we will find that it has executed for 1 tick (4 ms say) but 
its fair share was very very low.
	fair_share = delta_exec * p->load_weight / total_weight
If p->load_weight has been calculated after factoring in hierarchy (as
you outlined in a previous mail), then p->load_weight of those 1000 tasks
will be far less compared to the p->load_weight of one task belonging to
other user, correct? Just to make sure I get all this correct:
	User U1 has tasks T0 - T999
	User U2 has task T1000
assuming each task's weight is 1 and each user's weight is 1 then:
	WT0 = (WU1 / WU1 + WU2) * (WT0 / WT0 + WT1 + ... + WT999)
	    = (1 / 1 + 1) * (1 / 1000)
	    = 1/2000
	    = 0.0005
	WT1 ..WT999 will be same as WT0
whereas, weight of T1000 will be:
	WT1000 	= (WU1 / WU1 + WU2) * (WT1000 / WT1000)
		= (1 / 1 + 1) * (1/1)
		= 0.5
?
So when T0 (or T1 ..T999) executes for 1 tick (4ms), their fair share would
be:
	T0's fair_share (delta_mine)
			= 4 ms * 0.0005 / (0.0005 * 1000 + 0.5)
			= 4 ms * 0.0005 / 1
			= 0.002 ms (2000 ns)
This would cause T0's ->wait_runtime to go negative sharply, causing it to be
inserted back in rb-tree well ahead in future. One change I can forsee
in CFS is with regard to limit_wait_runtime() ..We will have to change
its default limit, atleast when group fairness thingy is enabled.
Compared to this when T1000 executes for 1 tick, its fair share would be
calculated as:
	T1000's fair_share (delta_mine)
				= 4 ms * 0.5 / (0.0005 * 1000 + 0.5)
				= 4 ms * 0.5 / 1
				= 2 ms (2000000 ns)
Its ->wait_runtime will drop less significantly, which lets it be
inserted in rb-tree much to the left of those 1000 tasks (and which indirectly
lets it gain back its fair share during subsequent schedule cycles).
Hmm ..is that the theory?
Ingo, do you have any comments on this approach?
/me is tempted to try this all out.
