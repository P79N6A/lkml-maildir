Oh my $DEITY, not this discussion again.
Look, this kind of patches (non-executable stacks, etc.) surfaces
at least twice a year, causes a two-three weeks long discussion
(flame-war), then dies. Linus hasn't taken such a patch into the
kernel so far. Neither has Alan.
Let it rest, or contact Linus directly in about a week or two (when
he has returned from his vacation) and as him if he a.) has changed
his mind, and if so, b.) thinks your patch looks good.

capable to shoot down this idea. Sorry if I'm wrong on that account.
