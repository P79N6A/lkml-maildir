apply_page_to_range has the side-effect of allocating all the pagetable
levels for the address range it walks.  Xen uses this to populate
pagetables (for example, build out the pagetable, and let the hypervisor
plug a mapping into the pte page).
If that's OK for the other uses, then it should be good.
