The PDC20267 is the primary controller, I do not have CONFIG_IDE set.
The issue with my initrd was mkinitrd --with=pata_pdc202xx_old didn't
include sd_mod; setting scsi_hostadapter accordingly in modprobe.conf
took care of this.
Once the kernel booted the system was seemingly starting without any
problems until various services tried to write files to the root
filesystem.  Each write attempt resulted in a "Read-only filesystem"
error yet all filesystems were mounted read-write.
The kernel had a ton of errors:
Buffer I/O error on device sda3, logical block 4869508
lost page write due to I/O error on sda3
