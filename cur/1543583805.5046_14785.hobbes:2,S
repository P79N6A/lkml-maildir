num_physpages is shifted too far in lvm_snap's calc_max_buckets():
would go to 0 on a 4GB, 8GB, ... 32-bit machine.  Okay, not quite all
the 4GB goes into num_physpages, so it's rather an issue with 5GB ...
Naive patch (against 2.4.3-pre2 or 2.4.2-ac11 or 2.4.2 or 2.4.1) below,
but I won't be submitting this to Alan or Linus myself (unless you ask):
I expect you'll want to consider whether the number should go on
climbing linearly in that way above 1GB.
