Sounds promising to me.  I also dislike the verbosity, but getting rid
of the messages completely makes me nervous, too, because sometimes
things do fail and then it's invaluable to have some idea of how far
the boot got (even if the person booting the machines has no clue what
the funny symbols on his screen actually mean).
