This adds the two UML-specific filesystems to 2.5.  hostfs allows directories
on the host to be mounted as a filesystem within a UML.  hppfs allows a UML's
/proc to be modified from the host.  This is useful in honeypots by allowing
the UML /proc to be made to look like a physical box, making it harder for
an attacker to recognize a compromised box as a UML.
Note that these add the filesystems under arch/um/fs since these are only
usable in UML.  If it would be better to have them under fs instead, then
I will fix that.
