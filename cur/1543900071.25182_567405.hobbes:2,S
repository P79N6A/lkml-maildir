OK, how does this look:
CFLAGS          := $(LINUXINCLUDE) -g -Os -D_SETUP -D__KERNEL__ \
                   $(cflags-$(ARCH)) \
                   -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes \
                   -march=i386 -mregparm=3 \
                   -include $(srctree)/$(src)/code16gcc.h \
                   -fno-strict-aliasing -fomit-frame-pointer \
                   $(call cc-option, -ffreestanding) \
                   $(call cc-option, -fno-toplevel-reorder,\
                        $(call cc-option, -fno-unit-at-a-time)) \
                   $(call cc-option, -fno-stack-protector) \
                   $(call cc-option, -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2)
I think dropping -fno-strict-aliasing for this code is probably bad...
it's pretty low-level stuff which does a lot of bitlevel manipulation.
