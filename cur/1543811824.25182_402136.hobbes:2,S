The original patch grabs the port.lock and then
calls serial8250_handle_port() which grabs the lock
again. Just remove the spin_lock/spin_unlock below.

+ if (!handled && (up->bugs & UART_BUG_TXEN)) {
+ spin_lock(&up->port.lock);
+ serial8250_handle_port(up, regs);
+ spin_unlock(&up->port.lock);
+ }
