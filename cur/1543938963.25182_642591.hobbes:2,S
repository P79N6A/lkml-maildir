Subject: [PATCH -mm v4 1/9] MAINTAINERS: Add myself as maintainer of the atmel_serial driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/24/96

The atmel_serial driver never had a MAINTAINERS entry, although Andrew
Victor has effectively been acting as a maintainer since he got the
driver merged into mainline in the first place.
I'll keep Cc'ing Andrew on all patches, but I'm going to take the
main responsibility for getting things moving upstream from now on.
