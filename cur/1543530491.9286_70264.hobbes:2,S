Hello,
I am not a linux hacker, so please advise me on Subj.
I have 2.2.14 and soundcard AcerMagic S23 with chip CS4232.
Audio (cs4232) & synth (opl3) works good, but MIDI
interface doesn't work. (I've just bought a MIDI keyboard
and want to use it...:-( )
My /etc/conf.modules (sound part):
alias char-major-14 cs4232
post-install cs4232 /sbin/modprobe "-k" "opl3"
options cs4232 io=0x530 irq=9 dma=1 dma2=0 mpuio=0x330 mpuirq=12
options opl3 io=0x388
All works fine, but MPU (UART) doesn't - there are no Midi
devices in /proc/sound (see down).
In linux/Documentation/sound/README.OSS is written about
CS4232: "MPU401 mode doesn't work (I don't know how to
initialize it)"
But in linux/drivers/sound/cs4232.c is "Just the WSS codec,
FM synth and the MIDI ports are supported. "
I am confused - can I use MIDI interface with this card
under linux?
(I think, that README.OSS is wrong, because there is also
written "Don't ever try to use isapnptools with CS4232",
and I even try isapnp and it seems it works - see down)
Please say what is wrong?
Regards,
Lada Dobias
