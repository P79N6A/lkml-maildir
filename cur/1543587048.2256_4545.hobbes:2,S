Greetings,
Is anyone having problems with running more than
1 VM on 2.4.3.  I have crashed my host O/S several
times when I try to start two VMs.  Currently,
I don't have an oops or other info to report, but
I did see a post on the vmware list about 2.4.3 SMP
and VMWARE.
Host:
dual PIII/800, 256 M RAM, RedHat 6.2 with updates, 2.4.3
VM1:
RedHat 7.0 with recent updates
VM2:
RedHat 7.0 with 2.4.3 and LIDS 
Cheers,
