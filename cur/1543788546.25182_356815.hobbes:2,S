Sorry, the one who initiated the request, so rka->context in this case
(the one on whose behalf the check is done).

You'll know the serial number any time an action is taken on the key,
and that's auditable.  I agree, if we find a need it can certainly be
resurrected.

Right, that makes sense considering that data is stored on disk and
likely needs to be initialized at some point by an admin or install.
Keys are transient and I'd expect policy engine to label them when
created.  Looks like Stephen sees a use, so perhaps just dropping
surrounding conditional logic and letting module handle it same as
setxattr case.
