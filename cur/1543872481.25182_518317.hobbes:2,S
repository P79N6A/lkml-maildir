I don't think reporting the error is the correct thing to do in the presense 
of the write having completed.  It's a race that the caller can do nothing 
about and is arguably a kernel bug, so I'd rather do something like:
		if (err) {
			if (!retval)
				retval = err;
			else
				printk_ratelimited(KERN_DEBUG
					"dio sucks and hit the race %ld %ld\n",
					retval, err);
		}
Aside from that, I much prefer this approach to fix the problem than going 
around and changing semantics.  Feel free to add my Signed-off-by.
