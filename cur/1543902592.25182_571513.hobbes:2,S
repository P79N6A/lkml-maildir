Can you point me to code where kernel captures process in signal
handling and code which runs after suspend to ram is finished?

No signal is sent. We tell affected processes that they have a signal
pending, 
and capture them in the signal handling code while the suspend to ram is
occuring. After the suspend to ram is finished, we recalculate whether
they 
have a signal pending, and let them continue.
Not being a guru on signal handling itself, I won't try to answer the
question 
itself :\.
