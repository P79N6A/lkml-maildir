Disclaimer:
I'm not a native English speaker.
In my ears, "obsolete" sounds like "there's something newer instead" and 
"broken" sounds like "it doesn't work at the moment".
This might be wrong, but if it's right I do prefer BROKEN.
Anyway, it's not that important whether OBSOLETE or BROKEN is used.
