Hi Jean,
thanks for the reply.

I indeed don't test RC/MM kernels. I'm fairly happy with the current
driver status, so I'm not doing any active new development on it. I run
standard Fedora kernels with CVS of the driver (which is the same as
what's in 2.6.10).

I have this card, but it's no in my computer (not enough PCI slots). Last
test is from a few months back. Other people (co-developers) test this for
me whenever I make small driver changes. They report that it works,
whatever that means. ;). I know they regularly use it for capture, so at
least MJPEG capture and overlay display has to work to some degree. Output
may be untested.

I have those two. Both work fine. I test raw capture, MJPEG capture and
overlay display at least once a week. I don't get an oops on the DC10. I
haven't tested output lately. I basically only test output when I make
changes to the relevant modules, and I haven't done that lately. Last time
I tested it (which must be around the time the driver was integrated into
the kernel, so before 2.6.0...), it worked for me.

See Buz.

My experience is not the same as yours, it seems... I cannot explain why,
unfortunately. Again, I'm sure your patch is correct, I'm just reporting
that I'm not seeing the same thing that you're seeing.
