A damned good reason.  Clearly we want the parent namespace to be able
to control what the child can do.  So whatever interface a child gets,
the parent should be able to somehow address.  Simple iptables rules
controlling traffic between it's own netdevice and the one it hands it's
children seem a good option.

Isn't that the same issue?

Ok, and in the meantime we can all use the network part of the bsdjail
