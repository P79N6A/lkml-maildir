It runs with an small Problem. HD-Led is nonstop burning since I've
installed pre8.
I tried pre7 again and the Problem is gone. So I think it's no Hardware
fault.
I'm using Gigabyte GA-686BXDS Mainboard and the ls-2.2.0-pre8 with  the
patch-int-2.2.0-pre7.4. 
Everything else working fine. Matrox Framebuffer is very nice for my old
HP-Workstationmonitor.
