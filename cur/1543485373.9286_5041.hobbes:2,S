I think because you want to do a pass on the whole list or over ~0UL
dcache entries.

The comment is obsolete I think.

Not every time nr_free_pages is too low but every time your machine can't
swapout and can't shrink the cache at priority = 6. With my latest VM code
it's really unlikely to happens if you really don't need to shrink the
dcache and inodes.
Could you try:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.2-pre2_arca-4.gz
It's against 2.2.2-pre2 (the pre2 patch can be found in the testing
directory of a kernel mirror).
