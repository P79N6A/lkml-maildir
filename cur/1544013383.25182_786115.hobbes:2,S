Unless you've developed abnormal super powers lately,
it's likely that it's doing its job.
Microwaves can't penetrate metal. The grill is keeping
the radioactive nastyness inside.  RF interference is
something else entirely. As to whether its harmful or not,
that's an ongoing debate (see the people who claim
cellphones fry your brain etc).
