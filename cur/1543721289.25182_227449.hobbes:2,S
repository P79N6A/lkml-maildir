If all was correct in first place this patch does not change behaviour.
For the embedded space all: is often not the right choice,
but for i386 (as you note) all: is always OK (except some rare cases).

For ppc I see nowhere documented what znetboot, vmlinux.sm neither
zimage is used for.
In total 5 different kernel targets that is un-documented.
Adding this patch gives you a good way to document
them - and room for it.
For the uimage target, I would at least expect a reference
to the relevant bootloader, and maybe a few notes about
the format as well. But there is not room for it on half a line.
If you know what uImage is, not problem. But for newcomers
wondering what it is - this is relevant.

Did you actually take a look in the mkspec script?
If ARCH equals i386 select bzImage, otherwise select vmlinux.
Not scalable at all - and this type of information should be part
of the architecture specific files, not the mkspec script.

What the patch does is to create a placeholder for
existing targets. No requirements exist for doing what you propose.
But for a given board I would expect the defconfig to select the correct
kernel image.
So when executing:
make ARCH=ppc FADS_defconfig && make ARCH=ppc CROSS...
Kbuild shall build a kernel that works with the selected board with a
default bootloader.
This would be enabled by FADS_defconfig having CONFIG_KERNEL_IMAGE_ZNETBOOT
selected.
In contrast the walnut board has a sane bootloader that accepts a vmlinux,
so here CONFIG_KERNEL_IMAGE_VMLINUX is selected in defconfig.
[Not knowing the baords in question, just as examples].
In this way the board specific config files select the target
to be build, not the other way around.
