On 2.6.13-rc7 the test program fails. It always fails when a wd == 1024.
If I skip inotify_rm_watch when wd == 1024, it will fail at wd == 2048.
It seems the idr layer has an aversion to multiples of 1024.
When I run your test program I get this a lot:
inotify_add_watch returned wd1 5
inotify_add_watch returned wd2 6
inotify_add_watch returned wd1 6
inotify_add_watch returned wd2 7
The pattern of 
add_watch wd1 = X
add_watch wd2 = X+1
rm_watch X
rm_watch X+1
add_watch wd1 = X+1
add_watch wd2 = X+2
Should never happen. We tell the idr layer to always give us something
bigger than the last wd we received.
Also, idr_get_new_above doesn't work all the time. Under 2.6.13-rc7, I
added this to inotify.c:359:
if (ret <= dev->last_wd) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "idr_get_new_above returned <= dev->last_wd\n");
}
I get that message a lot. I know I have said this before (and was wrong)
but I think the idr layer is busted.
