Changed that, thanks.

Changed that one also.
Along with 3 changes in response to Geert:
- DEBUG_KERNEL applies to all arch-es;
- DEBUG_SPINLOCK depends only on DEBUG_KERNEL && SMP;
- DEBUG_HIGHMEM depends only on DEBUG_KERNEL && HIGHMEM;
Updated patch (applies to 2.6.8-rc2-bk6) is now available at
  
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/kconfig/kconfig-debug-268rc2bk6.patch
(approx. 133 KB)

Localize Kconfig debug options into one file (lib/Kconfig.debug)
for easier maintenance and searching.
Summary of changes:
. localizes the following symbols in lib/Kconfig.debug:
    DEBUG_KERNEL, MAGIC_SYSRQ, DEBUG_SLAB, DEBUG_SPINLOCK,
    DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP, DEBUG_HIGHMEM, DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE,
    DEBUG_INFO
  and FRAME_POINTER for some instances of it (if it's freely
  user-selectable) but not for the cases where it's forced or
  it depends on some other options.
. adds DEBUG_KERNEL requirement to some DEBUG_vars;
. DEBUG_KERNEL applies to all arch-es;
. remove KALLSYMS from S390-specific kernel hacking menu;
  use KALLSYMS in the EMBEDDED menu instead;
. add CRIS and M68KNOMMU symbols for use in lib/Kconfig.debug;
. eliminate duplicate "General setup" labels in sparc64 config;
. whitespace cleanup;
. fixed a few trival typos;
Portions of the original patch were also done by
