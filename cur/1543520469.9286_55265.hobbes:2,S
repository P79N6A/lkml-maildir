Yes and no.  Yes I flash the bios at the end of last month. But
the problem only show up when I set the AGP aperture to 256 MB to
try out the Turbo-GL a few days ago.  No, backing out to the last
two version of the bios doesn't help.
I'm surprised I didn't noticed this sooner.  Perhaps running with 
64 MB in Linux feels like 256 MB under Windows I guess.  Anyway, 
this seems to be a BIOS/AGP and linux memory detection related.
Note: Kernel 2.3.34 detected the memory correctly, so it must be 
using a different detection method from the one used in 2.2.x.
FYI:  Using older BIOS, 2.2.13 kernel only detected 15MB, Err..
      With newer BIOS (Nov 25), 2.2.13 kernel detected 64MB. Hmm..
Thanks for the responses, this is no big deal for me.  I'm perfectly
happy to add mem=256M to correct the detection.  Just thought that
this could be of interest to others since BH6 is a very common MB.
