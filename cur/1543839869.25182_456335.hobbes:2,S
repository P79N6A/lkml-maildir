Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: Reload CS when startup_64 is used.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In long mode the %cs is largely a relic.  However there are a few cases
like lret where it matters that we have a valid value.  Without this
patch it is possible to enter the kernel in startup_64 without setting
%cs to a valid value.  With this patch we don't care what %cs value
we enter the kernel with, so long as the cs shadow register indicates
it is a privileged code segment.
Thanks to Magnus Damm for finding this problem and posting the
first workable patch.  I have moved the jump to set %cs down a
few instructions so we don't need to take an extra jump.  Which
keeps the code simpler.
