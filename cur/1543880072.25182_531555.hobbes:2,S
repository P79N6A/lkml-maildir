ok :) (And i guess i was too touchy - sorry about coming out swinging.)

yeah. If you could come up with a sane definition that also translates 
into low overhead on the algorithm side that would be great! The only 
good generic definition i could come up with (nice levels are isolated 
buckets with a constant maximum relative percentage of CPU time 
available to every active bucket) resulted in having a per-nice-level 
array of rbtree roots, which did not look worth the hassle at first 
sight :-)
until now the main approach for nice levels in Linux was always: 
"implement your main scheduling logic for nice 0 and then look for some 
low-overhead method that can be glued to it that does something that 
behaves like nice levels". Feel free to turn that around into a more 
natural approach, but the algorithm should remain fairly simple i think.
