No.
Not what I have seen with db workloads exhibits such pattern.  There are
basically two types of db workloads: one does transaction processing, and
I/O pattern are truly random with large stride, both in the context of
process and overall I/O seen at device level.  A second one is decision
making type of db queries.  They does large sequential I/O within one
process context.
This rawio test plows through sequential I/O and modulo each small record
over number of threads.  So each thread appears to be non-contiguous within
its own process context, overall request hitting the device are sequential.
I can't see how any application does that kind of I/O pattern.
