Hi,
i'm very sorry but i've to bring this topic to your attention again. We've
the source now. Fine. But there is no single sign of a GPL (compatible)
license anywhere. There are some "Broadcom All rights reserved" copyrights.
So i'm wondering wether the files inherit the GPL or do they have to be
declared as GPL by Broadcom? The license of the other files (non linux
kernel related) is somewhat unclear too.
Thanks for sharing your opinions.
Regards,
    Florian
