Dropped for good. The core code doesn't support failing in init_chipset.
Instead I've adjusted via82cxxx to do the check earlier in init_one().
Also avoids an API change and all the noise.

NAK. Fix is to remove bogus must_check from pci_set_mwi (and some of the
other functions)
> * sc1200: handle pci_enable_device() failure during resume
NAK: if the pci_enable_device fails here the best we can do is attempt
to get it back and hope the pci_enable_device failure is bogus. This is
a can't happen case anyway so its a waste of memory. If you insist on
checking pci_enable_device returns everywhere then please move the
printk into the pci_enable_device function so that we don't bloat the
kernel with a load of pointless identically messages for an event that
never happen, one per driver.
