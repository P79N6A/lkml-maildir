Subject: [PATCH 07/13] checkpatch: fix continuation detection when handling spacing on operators
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/7/136

From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@canonical.com>
We are miss categorising a continuation fragment following an operator
which may lead to us thinking that there is a space after it when there
is not.  Fix this up.
