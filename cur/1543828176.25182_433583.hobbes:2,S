If all things about apps are properly maintained/managed, it is reconfigured
by the user/system admin *before* cpu hotremove.
The case "the kernel have to move the task to other cpu which user doesn't want"
means the application is already broken.
So, I think "stop mis-configurated process" can be one way for handling  such apps.
For example)
After exchanging broken cpu, the application can continue its work with the
same # of cpus.
