Aw damn, I missed it again. LKML gets about 300 posts/day. The last
time util-linux was offered, I missed out. Bummer.
Well, how about giving me a chunk of it? I'd like /bin/kill please.
I already ship a nicer one in procps anyway, so you can just delete
the files and call that done. (just today I was working on a Fedora
system and /bin/kill annoyed me)
VERY STRONG SUGGESTION: build a full test suite before you mess with
the source. This isn't some cute toy like xeyes or a silly game.
This is util-linux, which MUST work.
