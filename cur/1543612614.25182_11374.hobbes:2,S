If this becomes true, then Linux fails. If the coreLinux designers did
not "get" the UNIX design and understand what was good about Plan9, then
Linux would look like IRIX without quality control. And the engineer
formerly known as Linus has admitted as much in  past .e.g. with the 
comment about UNIX being about "Desgin with a capital D".

I'm at a loss here. I state that an emphasis on design has been critical
to Linux  and you respond that it would be bad if Linus wanted to
personally engineer every aspect of the Linux kernel. 
In the english language, the word "design" does not have the same
semantics as "control every detail". 
Anyways, enough.
