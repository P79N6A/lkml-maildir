The ibmtr driver got changed together with the tr_type_trans rewrite.

The IBMTR driver used to like packets laid out like this:
	<header> <padding> <data> 
	0                  0x20
which 1) assumes that headers can't be longer than 20 bytes (*), and
2) makes things problematic for DMA-capable cards that want one
packet-buffer (i.e. without scatter-gather).
This rewrite makes things lots easier for other token ring cards, but
you'll have to adjust to the new layout:
	<header> <data>
	0        ??
I hope this helps. 
Best regards,
