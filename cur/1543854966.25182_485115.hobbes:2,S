Legacy/Native IDE mode is designed for compatibility with some old OS without AHCI driver but looses SATAII/AHCI features such as NCQ. This patch will make SB600 SATA run in AHCI mode even if it was set as IDE mode by system BIOS.
is this really the right thing? You're overriding a user chosen
configuration here.... while that might be justifiable.. it's probably a
good idea to at least provide a safety-valve for this one. The user
might have made that selection very deliberately.
