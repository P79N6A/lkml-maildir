Hello all,
Nice to see that this driver gets forward ported to 2.6. I originally
wrote it for pcmcia-cs, but it made its way into 2.4 after a while.
Thanks to all the people who added code and fixes.
I'm not sure how the current Linux pcmcia layer works, and I am not
involved in powerpc land anymore so I have no comments on the porting
work or the driver itself.

I remember it was interesting to write the driver for pcmcia-cs. This
was because the mpc8xx socket hardware did not implement per-window
offsets, and pcmcia-cs required that. So a wild guess is that this
static/notstatic thing is related to that.
