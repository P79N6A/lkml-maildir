In 2.6 there is an API and knfsd code is less interwoven with dcache
internals.  In practice what this means is that the dcache code paths
which are only exercised by NFS move from NFS code into fs/dcache.c
and fs/exportfs/ and have a pretty wrapper but are not any less
unnatural or NFS-specific.  The problem is the need to convert an NFS
file handle off the wire (which contains an inode number) into a dentry.
This kind of bottom-up construction of dentry paths is *painful* as
the dcache really wants to grow from an fs root down.
