make xconfig under 2.5.29 appears to be broken.
Errors occur when make tkconfig.tk
kconfig.tk
fs/partitions/Config.in:28 can't handle dep_bool/dep_mbool/dep_tristate
condition
[blah]
Error in startup script: invalid command name "clear_choices" while executing
"clear_choices"
(procedure "read_config" line 3)
invoked from within
"read_config .config"
(file "scripts/kconfig.tk" line 656)
Hope this helps
make menuconfig all works OK and the kernel partially builds.
Cheers,
Bruce Stephens.
