Welcome to the club. Our PE2650 used to hang hard anywhere from a few
days to two weeks after each reboot. This started after our RH7.3 to
RH8.0 upgrade and may be related to problems with the tg3 NIC driver.
(RH7.3 was stable, but then I think we used a bcm<something> driver.)
After having these problems from January to March or April, with a
a series of RH upgrade kernels, I accidentally found that enabling
the I/O-APIC nmi_watchdog solved all problems. (I can only speculate
that somehow the regular I/O-APIC NMIs prevent some hang somewhere.)
It's now running stable as a rock since April.
