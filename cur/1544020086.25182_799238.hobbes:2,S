I don't think that's right. Now you don't end up calling 
pci_pm_default_suspend_generic() at all, and this no pci_save_state().
But I think it could easily be the call to pci_disable_enabled_device(). 
It does that
	if (atomic_read(&dev->enable_cnt))
		do_pci_disable_device(dev);
and that ends up disabling PCI_COMMAND_MASTER and then calling 
pcibios_disable_device().
Any device we have ever done pci_enable_device() on would trigger this, 
which includes PCIE bridges, for example. And while the pcie driver does 
that
	pcie_portdrv_restore_config ->
		pci_enable_device(dev);
thing to re-enable it, that's a no-op since the enable_count is already 
non-zero.
And we do try to restore it (pci_restore_standard_config() will call 
pci_restore_state()), but since we've done the 
pci_disable_enabled_device() _before_ we did the pci_save_state(), we now 
restore a non-working setup. 
I think. The rules are too damn subtle there.  Rafael, can you look around 
a bit?
