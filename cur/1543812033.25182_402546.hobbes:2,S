Do you mean - does 2.6.16-rc5 work for me?
I haven't tried that yet. The lowest I went in Andrew's 2.6.16-rc5-rc1
patch stack was one patch, which would be 2.6.16-rc5 plus
"linus.patch." That worked for me, as did a few points between that and
gregkh-driver-allow-sysfs-attribute-files-to-be-pollable.patch
I will try a plain 2.6.16-rc5 as well, shortly.
