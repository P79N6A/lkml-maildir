   Exactly a module intended to run on both linux, and say freebsd would 
not be a derived work of linux.  (At least if I'm understanding Linus 
right.) The portion that interfaces with linux would obvious be a 
derived work.  It could be very easily (correctly imho)) argued that the 
module when compiled for linux would be bound by the gpl. In fact you'd 
be better off dual licensing the generic sections under both BSD, and 
GPL, while leaving linux wrapper gpl, and the *BSD wrapper BSD.
