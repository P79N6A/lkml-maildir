Subject: [PATCH] alim15x3.c: M5229 (rev c8) support for DMA cd-writer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Michael De Backer <micdb@skynet.be>
Configuration bits are not set properly for DMA on some chipset
revisions. It has already been corrected for M5229 (rev c7) but not for
M5229 (rev c8). This leads to the bug described at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5786
 (lost interrupt + ide
bus hangs).

This has been tested on ASUS A8R32-MVP motherboard (M5229 c8) with
2.6.18-rc6, 2.6.18-rc6-mm1, 2.6.18-rc5-mm1, 2.6.17.10 and two different
cd-writers. It completely solves the problem. 
The following patch is against the 2.6.18-rc6 or 2.6.18-rc6-mm1 kernel:
