Oh, that's good news. I have not seen them yet...

... so please resend.
We've just frozen the kexec-tools-testing tree for an upcoming
release, but if you resend soon and your patches are trivial you may
be able to talk us into merging your changes before the release..

Right, the mode switching code in purgatory.

For kexec I think it is just fine. But for kdump, are you sure things
will work out ok? There are some differences between the i386 and
x86_64 kexec-tools code and I wonder if feeding i386 info into an
x86_64 kernel will work properly.
Thanks!
