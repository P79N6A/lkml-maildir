Hi,
  when I try my SiS900 under 2.4.10-ac10 with or without Jeff's patch, it
works very well here in my laptop. But I have feelings that this kernel
(fastly configured 2.4.10-ac10 with Rik's eating patch) is little bit slower
than my previous one (2.4.6-ac2) ...
Best regards,
                                                            --Robert V0jta
