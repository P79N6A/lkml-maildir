Hi! Quick question: is it possible to write an IDE driver for a controller
that is not mappable using outp and those memory-mapped thingys ? 
I see all the nice overrideables in struct hwif_s but the main code still
uses OUT_BYTE which is hardcoded to an outb_p.. non-overrideable. Same
thing with ide_input/output_bytes, they do direct in/out accesses also
without consulting any hwif specific routine.
So what do I do if my controller does not have a simple memory-mapping for
each IDE-register into the memory ? Do I have to clutter ide.h and ide.c
with #ifdef's or is there any cleaner abstraction on the way (something
like adding a hwif field to perform the OUT/IN-byte stuff, and
ide_xxput_bytes) ?
(I have a solution working by replacing OUT_BYTE and ide_xxput_bytes, but
wanted to make it without having to patch the "official" ide.c/ide.h)
Regards,
Bjorn
