Hi
Some older Mach32 cards had odd timing issues that were causing video 
memory corruptions. Perhaps something isn't getting cleared from 
memory quick enough? 
Mostly these problems seemed to involve xfree and other graphics 
applications, but most have since been fixed by better drivers.
See: 
http://lom.pvrr.ru/unix/X332doc/ati15.html
Did you try altering the rom location incase you're getting a 
conflict with something else?
