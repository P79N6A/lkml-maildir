Yes.  I didn't do the original port and am now just finishing up my
port to 2.5.X.

For all of these delays, I'd be more than happy to make them all into
sleeps if I can tell, from inside ahc_delay() if I'm in a context where
it is safe to sleep.  On the other platforms that this core code runs on
I'm usually not in a context where it is safe to sleep, so I don't want
to switch to using a different driver primitive.

I don't care when the write occurs only that it will occur eventually.
The buffer will get flushed eventually so there is no need to call
ahc_flush_device_writes().
