Thanks. :)

This should be rather easily fixable, but it has to be done by someone who
is more familiar with whatever prefered toolkit. I'm familiar with QT and
it's absolutely great to get quickly reasonable results, if someone wants
something else I gladly will help, but I can't do it myself.
The interface to the back end is quite simple so it should be no real
problem to add a different user interface.

Well, it happened mostly in my own world, so you didn't miss much. People
seemed to be scared because of the last discussion and are afraid to
invest some time into it. So far I had only some feedback from a few
people (for which I'm already thankful) and it where mostly interface
issues. All the coding work and major design decissions so far are my own.
So what you've seen so far on lkml is pretty much almost all the feedback
I got. It seems unless you state that you're not completely opposed to it,
I'm afraid it won't get better.

Fine with me.

All this is in the archive.

Fine with me too. I don't care much about names (as long as they make
sense) and I thought about a cool name, but I couldn't come up with
something, so if anyone has other suggestions...

Oops,that must have got lost somehow, it's fixed here.

Thanks, I hope this will help.
(Hmm, I hope your mail still makes it to lkml, in the meantime I left a
few more quotes than I usually would do.)
