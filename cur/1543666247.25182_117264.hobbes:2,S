It feels just fine, perhaps because I haven't stepped off any cliff. 
You might want to stop and consider what SuSE would do if someone decided
they didn't like SuSE and came up with a pathetic shell script and started
describing it as "a system compatible with SuSE".  I'm pretty sure that
your lawyers would be all over them in about 30 seconds.  Ditto for Red
Hat, Alan.  I believe it is your founder who has carefully explained to
all of us the importance of brand.  In fact, isn't the point that Red Hat
is nothing *but* brand?  So how fast would I get sued if I came out with
"Larry's Red Hat Linux"?  Pretty fast, right?
I stand behind my statements.  If you don't like them, oh, darn.
