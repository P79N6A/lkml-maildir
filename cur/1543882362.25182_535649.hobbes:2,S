Umm. I don't want to be picky, but that's not quite true. The progress
bar is done in userspace.
There's also the possibility of using a userspace app to manage storage
too (I did work on establishing/tearing down an NBD connection as
necessary but didn't quite get it finished and have never released it).
That said, this bit can be torn out by simply removing a file and the
Makefile line.
