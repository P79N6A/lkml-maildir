"run" is a little program I wrote to echo its arguments and exec
the program specified.  That way, I could be certain what strings
were delivered to the execvp() syscall.  Here is the code, the
invocation and the result:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int
main( int argc, char** argv )
{
  printf( "Run\t%s (%d args)\n", *++argv, --argc - 1 );
  {
    int i = 0;
    char** pp = argv+1;
    while (++i < argc)
      printf( "\targ %d\t%s\n", i, *(pp++) );
  }
  return execvp( *argv, argv );
}
> run vi test
Run     vi (1 args)
        arg 1   test
"^IÎë^X~M¶" [New File]:q
:q
Were I to have written out the file (which I have done on occasion),
the result would be a file named, "^IÎë^X~M¶".  Not good.
Whatever the cause of this problem, I think it is the primary
reason for another problem:  after several invocations, Netscape
suddenly complains that I have no default Inbox, and so I cannot
receive my mail.  But it takes several invocations.  The result is
a netscape process that is not talking to my xwindow, so I have
to ps e|egrep netscape and kill -9 the process :(.
I just tried something:
> run run vi xxx
Run     run (2 args)
        arg 1   vi
        arg 2   xxx
Run     vi (1 args)
        arg 1   xxx
"^IÎë^X~M¶" [New File]:q
Interesting.  By the way, this manifestation of the problem
goes away if I set my login shell to bash, instead of ksh.
The Netscape problem remains, however.
This is a highly, highly reproducible problem.
_any_ suggestions at all?  Please?
