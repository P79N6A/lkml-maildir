UHCI has one bad disadvantage: the way it is designed, you can choose
either slow USB or slow system.
If you are doing bulk usb transfers at high speed (faster than ISDN modem,
or so), you need to make loop in the command "tree", which hogs down your
PCI bus (leading to slow overall performance). It is called FSBR and its
ugly. 50% system slowdown due to stupid UHCI.
