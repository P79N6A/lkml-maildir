Could somebody help me increase the number of shared memory segments
above 128?
It looks like I just need to up _SHM_ID_BITS from 7 to 8 in
include/asm/shmparam.h.  Will this do it?  Do I need to do anything else?
Can I up it to 9 without any problems?
Thanks,
Dan
PS: I'm on RH 6.2 with a stock 2.2.14 kernel on an Intel PIII.
