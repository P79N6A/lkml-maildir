I tried basically the same setup here. It works, but on an older machine 
(read: not acpi controlled). Newer mainboards are fully ACPI controlled, 
and therefore use ACPI to configure and detect devices like hard disks, 
hard disk controllers, etc. For some reason, on some boards, devices on 
the fourth logical controller (onboard plus three devices) will not be 
seen. I've found no solution to this problem. All I can do is curse 
manufacturers for implementing ACPI.
This is the only thing I can come up with. 
My next step is to avoid software raid completely and drop some money on a 
3Ware hardware solution. It's more flexible anyways (and guaranteed to 
work). I'm not exactly happy with the Linux software raid (or really, any 
software raid at all).
