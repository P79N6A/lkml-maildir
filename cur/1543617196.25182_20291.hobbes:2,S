That's the case in most of my "benchmarks".
e.g. dbench 32:
2.4.18-pre3
sched-O1-2.4.17-H7.patch
10_vm-22
00_nanosleep-5
bootmem-2.4.17-pre6
read-latency.patch
waitq-2.4.17-mainline-1
plus
all 2.4.18-pre3.pending ReiserFS stuff
Throughput 41.5565 MB/sec (NB=51.9456 MB/sec  415.565 MBit/sec)

What do you think about IO-wait for top/ps like SUN have?
Do you think we lost CPU cycles, there?
