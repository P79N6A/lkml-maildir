Hmm... the problem I would like to solve is that IP-over-InfiniBand
has 20 byte hardware addresses.  One can implement a driver that lies
about its HW address len (you have an internal ARP cache and only
expose a hash value/cookie to the rest of the world).  In fact I've
done just that for IPoIB.
It works but it's ugly and overly complex.  I would like to find a
clean solution for 2.5/2.6, but it looks like it will require changes
to the net core.  I'd like to do those now so the IPoIB driver can
just drop in cleanly later.  (I want to be able to just add
drivers/infiniband during 2.6 without and invasive changes required)
To do that seems to require increasing MAX_ADDR_LEN -- otherwise I
don't see what the driver can put in addr_len/dev_addr.
Thanks,
  Roland
