Does anyone knows if there's something that would make WinNT Domain
Controler (PDC) load user/password/group maps from NIS server???
It's retarded, but I need to maintain unix accounts centraly (NIS) on
Linux, but need to have samba to authenticate agains NT domain, and I
don't want to recreate accounts for everyone on an NT machine after
I create them on Linux.
Thanks!
