(less columns, please)
OK.  So prev_page and prev_offset are now a complexified representation of a
loff_t, no?  
So why don't we just use a loff_t for this?
Anyway, the asymmetry in our handling of prev_index (sometimes called
prev_page!) and prev_offset is unpleasing.  This:

improves things somewhat.  But I think it would be nicer if their handling
was unified, or at least consistent.  We update ra.offset here, and we
update ra.prev_page over there.
And shouldn't offset be called prev_offset?  Or should prev_page be called
page?  Or index?  Or prev_index?  Or Marmaduke?  The naming is all a mess.
Wanna take a look at all of this, please?
