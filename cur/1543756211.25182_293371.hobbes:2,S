But since filesystem detection isn't handled in the kernel, changing the  
link order is pointless. Please fix your /etc/filesystems instead.
~# grep camera /etc/fstab
/dev/sda1 /mnt/camera auto users,noauto 0 0
~# strace -o mount.trace mount /mnt/camera
~# grep filesystems mount.trace
open("/etc/filesystems", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
~# cat /etc/filesystems
ext2
ext3
nodev proc
nodev devpts
iso9660
reiserfs
vfat
udf
Also check man 8 mount, specifically option -t:
[...] Creating a  file /etc/filesystems can be useful to change the probe  
order (e.g., to try vfat before msdos) ...
This is from man-pages 1.66, btw.
