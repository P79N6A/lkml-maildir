He appears to be correct; The driver for the 3c589 at least does hot-swap
in 3.0.12. I can't try the Wavelan/915 right now, but presumably the
WaveLAN/IEEE and PRISM/am930 (linux-wlan) drivers need the same fixes. I
assumed since it happened before with all the cards, that since the
WaveLAN/IEEE and linux-wlan drivers still did it that it was still
happening, and I appear to be wrong.

Nope, it's not. If I get time tomorrow I'm going to try to fix the other 2
drivers I need (and test the Wavelan/915 driver)
