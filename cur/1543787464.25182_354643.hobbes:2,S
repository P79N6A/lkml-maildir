Appreciate your help. 
I applied your patch manually since something was wrong during
patching. I guess we might not use same version of kernel. Mine is
2.6.8. 
But the function parse_args_reloc() still failed even though I have
passed a module param like elf_plt_info=1 during insmod. Here's the
command to load the module.
#>insmod mrbig.ko elf_plt_info=1
And console output is: 
init_module: consider insmod mrbig elf_plt_info=25,27,322144,160
I have no idea what the plt section is and what is going on in
module_frob_arch_sections() function. Any hints or documents I can
refer to?
Thanks,
Wilson Li
