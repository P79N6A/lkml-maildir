Hi Linus,
Here are the bulk of our ocfs2 changes for 2.6.24-rc1.
The biggest feature being added here is inline data support for Ocfs2. This
allows the file system to store file and directory data inside of the inode
block. Since Ocfs2 (like other similar cluster file systems) has rather
large inodes, this saves on space and improves performance on small files
and directories. Most of the patches in the inline-data seres are just
simple function moves or code refactors designed to allow the final
inline data patches to require very little in the way of code duplication.
Inline data is treated as a single contigous inode region starting at offset
0. Internally, the file system detects those inodes via an on-disk flag and
populates pages from their inode blocks. Writes go in the opposite
direction, with the exception that large writes force an inode out to
extents. For simplicity, shared writeable mmap and large extending truncates
also force the file out to extents.
The rest of the patches include:
 * ->show_options support
 * Various small cleanups
Thanks,
	--Mark
