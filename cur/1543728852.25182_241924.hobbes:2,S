The HPT374 only supports 33Mhz timings. If you are overclocking it then
its probably going to mostly work. The lines added are not "from an
older source file" but form a port forwards of long missing and
important fixes from 2.4 that have been there for a long long time.
So the first question is why does your late series HPT37x think its
running at > 33Mhz ? Are you overclocking it ?
