Yep, I guess patch for 1.0.0 kernel would count as Linux compatible. I
even believe that patch for FreeBSD would count as Linux
compatible. As long as you can get source of the driver, it is easy.
Maybe better sticker would be
"includes driver sources".
[Long time ago I got double-speed cdrom, and on its driver disk, there
was C source of the driver. Porting it to linux was matter of two
days, IIRC. And it had korean comments ;-)].
