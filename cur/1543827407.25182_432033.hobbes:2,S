Andrew:
I was a bit afraid about that because I have no CDROM to try it out.
But since Michael has tested it OK, it should be OK for the stable kernel.

Should be ok. I have no experience on it. So Michael and users with
the taste have the last word :)
It might also be helpful to generate some uevent for it. User land
tools can then run blockdev --setra in a configurable way.

The patch operates on a per-fd basis. Thus the readahead size will not
be affected for other files and CDs. The readahead size also restores
on reopening the file :) 
Thanks,
