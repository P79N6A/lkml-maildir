It is just a little tcpdump glitch.
19:34:54.532271 < 10.2.20.246.33060 > 65.171.224.182.8700: . 44:44(0) ack 84439343 win 24544 <nop,nop,timestamp 226080638 99717832> (DF) (ttl 64, id 60946)

It is one ACK (look at IP ID), shown twice. This happens sometimes
with our packet socket.

I understood. I expect when 184*4, when you said 184. But minimum is
still 730 (unscaled 1460*2). If you really saw values lower than 730
(unscaled 1460*2), there is another more severe problem and the suggested
patch will not solve it.
