You do not modify the Makefile. You grab the ".config" file with
which the existing code was compiled, search for "CONFIG_SMP".
Change it from:
"# CONFIG_SMP is not set"
 to:
"CONFIG_SMP=y".
Then execute `make clean ; make oldconfig`. Then make
bzImage (or whatever). This is a reversible procedure.
