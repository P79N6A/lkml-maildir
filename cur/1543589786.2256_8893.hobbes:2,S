It sounds like you are running "make config" after you make your changes.
If you run "make oldconfig" instead of "make config" it will not ask you
questions unless you have added config options to the configure scripts.
Its probably not necessary to run either on of these if you have just made
minor changes to the code.  It does not hurt to do it though, and 
"make oldconfig" is fast.
Hope this helps,
Jim
