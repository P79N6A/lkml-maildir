Yes, there are problems with the active/expired arrays but they're no 
worse with smpnice than they are without it.
Going to a single priority array would eliminate this problem not to 
mention other problems to do with when to excuse tasks from being put on 
the expired array at the end of their time slice (see Mike Galbraith's 
patches).  But I haven't had much luck pushing that barrow. :-)

Yes, but this will get it onto a CPU sooner so it's not all bad.  Once 
again it's no worse than without smpnice.
I said in the patch description that there are active/expired array 
issues that make load balancing less than perfect with and without 
smpnice.  How far we go trying to eliminate them is the question.
If you have a better suggestion for how move_tasks() does its job, how 
about providing a patch and with supporting arguments as to why its 
better.  If it is better then we can use it.

What about the very messy code I had to put in so that 
find_busiest_group() would return a group even if there were no queues 
in the group with more than one task.  Similar for find_busiest_queue().

I meant for you to move the (highly speculative) active load balancing 
trigger out of load_balance() so that we can stop returning busiest 
groups and queues that have no hope of participating in successful load 
balancing.

I'm not sure what you mean here.  I'm not behind it at all.  I can see 
the need for HT systems to be able to move the only running task of a 
CPU to another CPU in another package but I think the implementation is 
appalling.  I think it needs a complete rewrite.
