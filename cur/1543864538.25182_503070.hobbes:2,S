In practice we have to extensively customise policy long before getting to the 
non-proc stage of optimising for small hardware.  The Familiar distribution 
(used on the iPaQ) has /proc but needs significant policy changes when 
compared to a typical Fedora workstation.  Not only is there the issue that 
embedded distributions have different daemons and path names to workstations, 
but the memory constraints mean that even a modular targeted policy is not as 
small as you desire.

I think that is the correct thing to do.  Someone who is prepared to do all 
the work needed to get a recent SE Linux system operating without /proc will 
have no problem changing the kernel config scripts and everyone else would be 
better off not being confused by being offered sets of options that are not 
viable.
