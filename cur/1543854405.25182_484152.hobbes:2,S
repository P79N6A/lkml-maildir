    That was a conclusion to which I came after looking at the 8259 code (that 
PIC being full capable of the priority masking).

    Well, such machines are SMP usually... :-)

    Nevertheless, 8259 drivers are doing exactly this on UP machines -- and 
they were doing this before and after genirq conversion...
