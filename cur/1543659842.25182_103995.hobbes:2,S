Apparently, 2.5.58 with ACPI on VAIO doesnt let the kernel boot. The =
screen goes blank, just after Uncompressing Linux message. I have RAGE =
mobility M1 video chip if thats relevant.=20
Same problem occurs with acpi=3Doff kernel option. But if I remove =
vga=3D788 from boot command line, i can actually see the boot messages =
for very short time. Sadly same thing happens after that - Blank Screen.
Framebuffer support + Mach64 related things are enabled.
