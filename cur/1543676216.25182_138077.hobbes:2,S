I'm puzzled why you did..
-	pci_for_each_dev(device)
+	while ((device = pci_find_device(PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, device)) != NULL)
when you could have just added whatever locking pci_find_device() does
to pci_for_each_dev()  You'd then not have had to touch any of these
drivers, and it'd look a damn sight better to look at IMO.
