I reported the above oops was fixed for me here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103349300620391&w=2
The new oops on boot for 2.5.39 which I referred to in that message,
and which I also reported for 2.5.40 here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103350518802833&w=2
has been fixed (for me anyway) in 2.5.40-ac3.
Thanks,
Steven
