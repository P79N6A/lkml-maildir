Yes, it would be best if the kernel became perfect at once.
But the patch is rather large. Better go in small steps.
Did you read the patch?

[You often do general cleanup. My purpose is not to do
general cleanup, although this is a cleanup. My purpose
is to give us a 32-bit dev_t. After this patch the last
occurrence of MAX_BLKDEV is in raw.c. If Linus takes it,
the next patch will eliminate MAX_BLKDEV.]
