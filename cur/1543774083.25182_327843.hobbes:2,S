Yeah, but so what ? don't freak out and take all of this so seriously.
It's not like nanokernels are going to disappear when this patch gets
broader acceptance. And who cares if you're wrong ? you ? :) Really,
get a grip man. :)
And, of course, DUH, making a kernel fully preemptive makes it (near)
real time. These aren't unexpected results.

Thanks for the numbers, really. I do expect some kind of performance
degradation, but there seems to be triggering some oddities with the
patch that aren't consistent with some of our expectations.
Be patient. :)
