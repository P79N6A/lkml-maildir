this has nothing to do with the bugs on bugzilla.
you're trying to send a janitor patch. It should be logical that the response to
that is not heated or receiving a joyous reception :)
If you have a problem getting your cleanup patch to the driver maintainer, send it
to the subsystem maintainer instead, or even the janitors, or even Adrian Bunk who
will gladly push it to everyone. Or, even to Andrew Morton who will carry it in
-mm for a while and then harrasses the subsystem maintainer to merge it for you!
Cheers,
Auke
