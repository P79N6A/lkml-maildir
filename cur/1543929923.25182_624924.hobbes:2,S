Normally I would let a patch like this sit in my mailbox
for a week and then delete it.
But this time I'll just let you know up front that I
don't see much value in this patch.  It is not a clear
improvement to replace int's with bool's in my mind and
the other changes are just whitespace changes.
And thus I can delete the patch from my mailbox
immediately :-)
Sorry.
