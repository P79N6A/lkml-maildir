Why not: "extX_ops.do_something_useful();", then have fs/ext/ext 
{2,3,4}_ops.c which implement those various operations just like we  
do for the Virtual Filesystem Switch?  Much as there are  
commonalities between all filesystems that get moved into the VFS;  
perhaps we should have a Virtual Ext Filesystem Switch (VEFS?  
VextFS?) which abstracts out the commonalities between the evolving  
ext{2,3} code and data format?  Such code would also provide a  
library of common routines which could be used to implement other  
specialized filesystems in the future.  Imagine a cluster-extfs which  
reuses some of the core extXfs code despite changing the on-disk  
format considerably!
