Easy.  Look at the data you're writing. Don't ever write zeroes, seek
ahead in the file being written instead.  The filesystem will create a hole
if possible.  You may want to optimize this a bit by not seeking past
very small runs of zeroes.
Of course cat is sometimes used to write to things that aren't regular
files, so make sure seek is supported and fall back to ordinary writing
when it isn't.
