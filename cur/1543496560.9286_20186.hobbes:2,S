Hello again,
I was wondering why FreeBSD has so much better NFS performance than
Linux against our 2.2.6-ac1 Linux RH 6.0 server (running knfsd).
The best I can achieve using iozone for Linux is : 6,5 Mo/s writing,
4,8 Mo/s reading.
The best I can achieve with FreeBSD (on a less powerful machine) is :
7,8 Mo/s writing, 5,9 Mo/s reading (with options -2 (NFS V2) -a 4
(read-ahead for large reading) to the mount_nfs command).
Can that be due to UDP vs TCP and/or the Van Jacobson algorithm ?
Trond, is that about to change (and to be improved :-) ?
A+,
