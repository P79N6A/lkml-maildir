Not in this case.

Not true.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again:
http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/
Users *are* willing to trade speed for features, under the right
circumstances.  Tiger *is* noticeably slower.  People *do* make
webservers out of it anyway.
Or, for an extreme example:
http://www.doom3.com/
Doom 3 can be made to run on much older hardware (the Voodoo3, I think),
by disabling things like the dynamic lighting.  The old way of doing
lighting is probably more than 3 times faster, I know it's more than
twice as fast.  The new way looks much, much better, and many people
upgraded their hardware -- at least a couple hundred dollars upgrade,
sometimes an entirely new box -- in order to play this game.
For that matter, the old way of doing this kind of discussion is email,
the new way seems to be a PHP Wiki, which has got to be more of a load
on the server, but people use it anyway.
In the real world, killer features trump performance.
All of this is irrelevent.  The performance isn't that bad.  It may even
be better, even if it's not *much* better.

Not the facility.  The specific example.

I'm lacking a little imagination right now.  It's Sunday night, after all.
Actually, I think it might be a big win for Debian-like package
management systems.  That's also somewhere in the "Silent Semantic"
archives.
Here's another, somewhat better example:  modifying a zisofs CD image.
I'm going to go reply to your other mail now; I think the details belong
there.
