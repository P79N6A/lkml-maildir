in that this is conceivably sufficiently off-topic to be a s/n issue, 
off-list replies are encouraged.
i've got to get another udma ide drive today or tomorrow. i know that 
my w.d. is a little flaky, and i've seen reports that at least some 
ibm drives are kind of screwy with 2.4.0.
my question: who makes drives that have thusfar proved trouble-free 
with 2.4.0?
thanks!

if half the people like red and half the people like blue, the 
country's favorite color is purple.
