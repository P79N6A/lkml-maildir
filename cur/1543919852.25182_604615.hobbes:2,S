After a quick look:
[sam@neptun x86.git]$ find -name '*.i'
./include/asm-x86/alternative-asm_64.i
./include/asm-x86/alternative-asm_32.i
./include/asm-x86/frame.i
./include/asm-x86/alternative-asm.i
./include/asm-um/frame.i
./include/asm-um/alternative-asm.i
[sam@neptun x86.git]$ grep '*.i' Documentation/dontdiff 
*.i
But I cannot see how this could result in the bug you
reported..
Anyway at least one dontdiff buglet - or we should preferably
drop the .i files in the kernel src.
