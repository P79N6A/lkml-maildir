Subject: Making kernel headers compile with C++ & libc5

Someone posted last week that linux/socket.h fails to compile under
c++, because of the use of implicit casts in inline functions that
return NULL.  This is a problem because it means that people using
libc5 (which uses the kernel headers) can't compile some c++
programs.
Further to the patch to include/linux/socket.h I've just posted, I've
just done a quick search through the kernel header files.  The same
simple problem may affect at least the following headers:
ghash.h 
pci.h 
proc_fs.h 
skbuff.h 
sunrpc/stats.h
Are these headers included when compiling libc5 programs with c++?  If 
so, I'll make a simple patch to try to fix the problem.
