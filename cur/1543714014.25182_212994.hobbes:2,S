One solution would be to watermark sigqueue and upon reaching
high mark, find the process with most signals queued and drop those.
This prevents one buggy process, even root-launched, from interfering
with non-buggy ones.
If low watermark is not reached, find _UID_ which have max # of
signals pending, and drop them all. This will work against rogue
user trying to DoS box who's careful enough to do it from multiple
processes.
