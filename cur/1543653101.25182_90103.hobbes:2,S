The tx_timeout code performs a full hardware reset to recover from 
hangs, but it seems that the nic hangs during the hardware reset :-(
The hang could be caused by incomplete tx underrun handling, the 
linuxfet driver resets several registers after a tx underrun.
Could you load the driver with debug=3? For example by adding 'options 
via-rhine debug=3' into your /etc/modules.conf?
If it hangs again, then send the dmesg messages to the mailing list - 
especially the last few lines before the first transmit timeout will help.
