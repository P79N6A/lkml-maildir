Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Keys: Key management updates  [try #3]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/20/318

These patches update a few key management related things, mainly security
related.  They have the following prerequisite patches from Andrew Morton's -mm
tree:
	selinux-add-hooks-for-key-subsystem.patch
	keys-fix-race-between-two-instantiators-of-a-key.patch
Some of these patches have been modified from the originals I've been given so
that they'll all apply in sequence.
