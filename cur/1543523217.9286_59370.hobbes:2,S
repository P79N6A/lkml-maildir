The big problem with putting BIOS code into the kernel is it can do a lot more
harm there. In a user process the BIOS code can be a bit more constrained
on the I/O ports you let it loose with and its ability to hit physical
kernel pages you dont expect. Now it simply COW's some zero pages and does
no harm.
Its a containment thing.
Of course it makes doing a vesa 1.2 console interesting to say the least
