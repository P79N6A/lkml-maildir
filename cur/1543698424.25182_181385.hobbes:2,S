I tested a combination of Takashi's version of the patch to 
drivers/pnp/card.c and Adam's patch to sound/isa/cs423x/cs4236.c applied 
to 2.6.0-test11 and report success. This is on a Dell Precision 
Workstation 410 which doesn't have a MPU device. The card has always 
been detected fine by ISAPNP and now when I modpobe snd-cs4236 the 
modules load just like they should. PCM output and input work fine. I 
exercised the audio system by running, at various times, xmms, aplay, 
alsamixer, and audacity and everything worked OK. No kernel-tainting 
modules were loaded. I would be happy to test the final version of these 
patches.
