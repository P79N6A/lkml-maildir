Okay, thanks for the reply. And, now that I have your attention, while it's 
not important to the issue anymore with the tests removed as the submitted 
patch did, do you have an opinion on (include/linux/pnp.h):
/* pnp driver flags */
#define PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE    0x0001  /* do not change the state 
of the device */
#define PNP_DRIVER_RES_DISABLE          0x0003  /* ensure the device is 
disabled */
I find DISABLE including DO_NOT_CHANGE rather unexpected...
By the way, I also still have this next one outstanding for you... :-/
