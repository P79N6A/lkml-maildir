This is correct; the program "scsidev" by Eric Youngdale has done this
for a long time, for example.
A few more things to remember when you're talking about
"location-based names":
1. PCI bus numbers are fairly volatile; they are assigned sequentially
   by a depth-first search.  Inserting a multiport Ethernet card
   (which usually have PCI-PCI bridges onboard) could move a whole lot
   of bus numbers for you.  Same thing with SCSI controller numbers.
2. Consider if location-basis is really what you want, and if so, if
   it really matters.  Rearranging your SCSI busses, for example, is
   probably quite common.  On busses where you have device serial
   numbers, or for disks where you have labels, it probably would
   provide a better basis.
3. Solaris seems to teach the lesson that if you make the device names
   too complex, noone will use them.  Solaris has a very complete
   location-based device naming scheme, but I know very few Solaris
   administrators who use those names, as opposed to the short
   symlinks.
