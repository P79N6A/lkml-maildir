It's probably something to do with:
# define permanent_kmaps_init(pgd_base)         do { } while (0)
Which is within the #else part of #if CONFIG_HIGHMEM.  So, if
CONFIG_HIGHMEM is not set, permanent_kmaps_init gets wiped out, and
therefore that warning will be issued.
Perhaps changing that to an empty inline would remove the warning?
