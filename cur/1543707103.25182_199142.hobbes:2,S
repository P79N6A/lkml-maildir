It's not THAT ugly, and it's also error-prone to type at the keyboard. The
only fundamental error in my suggestion was the location of tr.
Anyway, if you really want to correct the inconsistencies you need only
edit the sources for the modules in question; the names which appear in
/proc/modules appear to be defined in, for example,
drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c, where the .description section of the module
is set. Or change the filenames, though I don't know how that will fly with
the make process.
