Ingo, are any of the VP patches known to work on x64?  Here is thewade's
latest report:
--
I applied the patch and the kernel built, but like 2.6.9-mm2-VP-S9 it
crashed before it could load. The last bit of the message was a lot of
what I guess are frame pointers, but there was a few lines that had
info.
For example an RIP message having to do with add_preempt_count+16
But it all ended with Aieee...
I have yet to get any VP kernel to run on my x86_64. I suppose I should
try just the mm3 or mm4 patches without the VP portion, so that is what
I will do.
