Subject: [PATCH] local APIC and NMI watchdog on UP P6 systems

An updated version of the UP-APIC patch for Intel P6 processors
is now available at:
	
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/upapic/
The current version is intended for 2.4.0-test12 final.
This version is based on Ingo Molnar's upapic-2.4.0-test9-F8 patch,
with add-on patches from Maciej W. Rozycki and myself. I'm
intending to maintain it until it gets into 2.4 or 2.5.
I've used it since test10-pre and believe it to be safe for
general use, but more testers are welcome.
For those unfamiliar with the patch:
- It enables the local APIC found in most P6 family processors,
  even on UP systems which often keep it disabled.
- The NMI watchdog now works on UP systems too. This is interesting
  primarily for kernel hackers wishing to debug lockups.
- A properly enabled local APIC is a prerequisite for interrupt-
  driven use of the performance-monitoring counters.
