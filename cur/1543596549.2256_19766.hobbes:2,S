Subject: [PATCH] hgafb.c as module (unresolved symbol) 2.4.6+

Hi,
As far as i noticed - since 2.4.6
there should be defined
#define INCLUDE_LINUX_LOGO_DATA
instead of
#define INCLUDE_LINUX_LOGOBW
otherwise linux logos do not get included and unresolved symbol occures
patch against 2.4.7-pre{1,2,3} attached, which afaik also applies for 2.4.6
PS.
in any case - please CC - not subscribed
