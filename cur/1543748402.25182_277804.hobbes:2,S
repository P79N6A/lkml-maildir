Understood. BTW, I wouldn't consider some possible starvation of lower 
priority, non-realtime tasks to be incorrect behavior for a realtime 
system. The comments in the above email as well as previous emails were 
not intended as complaints or questions of correctness. They were more 
just thoughts generated while thinking about some of the reports of 
non-realtime tasks being starved.
