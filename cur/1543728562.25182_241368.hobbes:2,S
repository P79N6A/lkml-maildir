Hi!
With 2.6.8-rc4-bk1 I get "Aug 12 17:33:10 puma kernel:
unregister_netdevice: waiting for ppp0 to become free. Usage count = 1"
in the logs after pppd exit.
Also, the box won't reboot and print that message forever in the
console. sysrq-U && sysrq-R did it :-)
The last version I tried was 2.6.8-rc2-bk11 and, wrt this prob, is
running fine. So, the problem is in that window and the changelog for
rc4 mentions something about ppp:

If someone requires more information or tests feel free to ask!
Regards,
Nuno Silva
