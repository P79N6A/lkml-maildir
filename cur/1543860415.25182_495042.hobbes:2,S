your patch looks pretty ok to me in principle. A couple of suggestions 
to make it more mergable:
 - instead of BUG_ON()s please use DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON() and make sure 
   the code is never entered again if one assertion has been triggered.
   Pass down a return result of '0' to signal failure. See
   kernel/lockdep.c about how to do this. One thing we dont need are
   bugs in instrumentation bringing down a machine.
 - remove dead (#if 0) code
 - Documentation/CodingStyle compliance - the code is not ugly per se
   but still looks a bit 'alien' - please try to make it look Linuxish,
   if i apply this we'll probably stick with it forever. This is the
   major reason i havent applied it yet.
 - the xfs/wrap_lock change looks bogus - the lock is initialized
   already. What am i missing?
