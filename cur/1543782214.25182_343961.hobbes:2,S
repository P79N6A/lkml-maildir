Cool, thanks for updating it :)

A little more would be helpful, like:
get_xip_page: called by the VM to translate a block number to a page. 
        The page is valid until the corresponding filesystem is
unmounted. Filesystems
        that want to use execute-in-place (XIP) need to implement it.
        An example implementation can be found in fs/ext2/xip.c
cheers,
Carsten
