Hi,
After my succes report i _do_ noticed something unusual:
I'm not sure it's preempt related, but you wanted feedback :)
Sep  9 23:08:02 sjoerd kernel: __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x70/1).
Sep  9 23:08:02 sjoerd last message repeated 93 times

This is at the very moment i make a ppp connection to internet, and
get/set the time with netdate (for the first time after a reboot).
I didn't see this a second time (yet).
Btw this is 2.4.10-pre4+preempt-patch+pacht-below.
Greetings,
