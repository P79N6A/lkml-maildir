Here is the modifications I made:
//skbuff.h
//I added the folloing definitions
#define MAX_POOL_SIZE 4096
unsigned char *skbuff_data_pool[MAX_POOL_SIZE];
int skbPoolHead, skbPoolTail;
//skb_init()
//I add the following codes:
 for(i=0;i<MAX_POOL_SIZE;i++)
         skbuff_data_pool[i] = NULL;
 skbPoolHead = skbPoolTail = 0;
//alloc_skb()
//I made the following changes
if (skbuff_data_pool[skbPoolHead])
 {
   data = skbuff_data_pool[skbPoolHead];
  skbuff_data_pool[skbPoolHead] = NULL;
  if (++skbPoolHead == MAX_POOL_SIZE)
   skbPoolHead = 0;
 }
 else{ //Original path
  size = SKB_DATA_ALIGN(size);
  data = kmalloc(size + sizeof(struct skb_shared_info), gfp_mask);
  }
//skb_release_data()
//I made the following changes:
  if ((skbPoolHead == skbPoolTail) && (skbuff_data_pool[skbPoolHead] != 
NULL))
  //Original path
   kfree(skb->head);
                else{
   if (skbuff_data_pool[skbPoolTail])
    panic("Tail pointer must be null");
   skbuff_data_pool[skbPoolTail] = skb->head;
                        if (++skbPoolTail == MAX_POOL_SIZE)
    skbPoolTail = 0;
  }
