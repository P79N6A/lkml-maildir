Look in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Configure.help
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF
  Enable the ability to power off the computer after the Linux kernel
  is halted. You will need software (e.g., a suitable version of the
  halt(8) command ("man 8 halt")) to cause the computer to power down.
  Recent versions of the sysvinit package available from
  
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/daemons/init/
 (user:
  anonymous) contain support for this ("halt -p" shuts down Linux and
  powers off the computer, if executed from runlevel 0). As with the
  other APM options, this option may not work reliably with some APM
  BIOS implementations.

Red Hat Fix is to edit /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt
   change command="halt" to command="halt -p"
