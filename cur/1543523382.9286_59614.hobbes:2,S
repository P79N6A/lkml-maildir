Hi,
I'm involved in a project that includes instrumenting the kernel and
capturing all packets on the network for some traffic analysis studies.
Whenever a packet is received or transmitted, the instrumentation should
be printed out.  My problem is to figure out where to put this
instrumentation (in which file or function)  in order to capture all
packets (transmitted and received).  I know tcpdump also does a similar
thing, but I want this through the kernel.  Any hints would be greatly
appreciated.
Sincerely,
Aamir
