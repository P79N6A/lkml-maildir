The commit message for that thing is badly worded. It definitely hits 
ata_piix too, and it concerns a lot more than just the LITE-ON CD-ROM 
drives (ie that patch fixes a bug for me on a PIIX system I have access 
to, with a TDK drive).
But if it doesn't help for you, you have some other issue (which is not 
surprising - yours wasn't a SETFXSR error, and I don't think it would have 
worked very well before either).
So since it apparently _did_ work for you before, can you bisect it?
