Great. Thanks for the report. I too use them all day every day on each 
machine I have with distributed computing clients so they're pretty well 
tested.

It could easily be modified to suit the current scheduler. Obviously I want 
my scheduler to be considered for mainline at some stage in the future but 
there needs to be a good reason for that to occur, and the 12 other 
schedulers out there need to also be tested (we better hurry up or it could 
be twice that soon :P). At this stage I'll hold onto these patches and see 
what happens. I'd rather not have to rewrite it to suit the current 
scheduler and go through all the bugtesting again since there isn't a 
burning need for this scheduler policy in mainline at the moment. The 
lack of a large amount of feedback about staircase shows that most people 
aren't really interested in the cpu scheduler at the moment anyway.
Cheers,
Con
