I'm almost done with the latency tracer work, and there are only a total
of 6 hooks that I needed.
 - schedule context switch
 - try_to_wake_up
 - hard_irqs_off (which is already there for lockdep)
 - hard irqs on (also for lockdep)
 - lock_contention (already in for the lock contention code)
 - lock acquire (also in there for contention code)
With the above, we could have this (if this is what I think you are
recommending). For example in the context_switch case:
	trace_switch_to(prev, next);
	switch_to(prev, next, prev);
and in sched.h I could have:
static inline trace_switch_to(struct task_struct *prev,
			struct task_struct *next)
{
	trace_mark(kernel_schedudule,
		"prev_pid %d next_pid %d prev_state %ld",
		prev->pid, next->pid, prev->pid);
	trace_context_switch(prev, next);
}
and have the trace_context_switch code be something that is turned on with
the latency tracing utility (config option). That way production code can
keep it off.
