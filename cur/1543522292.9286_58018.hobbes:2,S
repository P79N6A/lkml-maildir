The only point of delaying flushes to disk is to merge two writes into one
single flush. This applyes even more strongly to floppies that are very
slow to write data. The slower the disk is, the more delay you want to
have between the flushes.

It's not catastrophic for linux (or it's an implementation bug that has to
be fixed and not a design one as far I can tell) but you'll find your fd
corrupted when you'll read it from another computer, and that's expected.
Personally I don't want to fallback in luser-windows-mode just because
soembody doesn't know what unmount is good for, so the kernel I run on my
machine will continue to cache writes on floppy like with (or more then)
IDE/SCSI harddisk.
Setting a lower flushtime won't fix the hard-floppy-unplug problem either,
it may only happen to reduce the damage.
