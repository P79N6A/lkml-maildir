Hm, something went wrong there, 'nousb' should not be a module.
Do you have the usbcore built into the kernel, or as a module?

I don't see the empty directory here:
/sys/module/nousb/parameters $ ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    0 Jun  8 11:04 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root    0 Jun  4 16:59 ..
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun  8 11:04 usbcore.autosuspend
Care to send me a .config?
thanks,
