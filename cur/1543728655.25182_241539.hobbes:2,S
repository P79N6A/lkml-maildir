That's something completely different (used for stack overflow
debugging, I think).  (and ".globl mcount, _mcount" means it's also
called mcount)
Look at Ingo's patch; it only adds mcount() to arch/i386 (although
__mcount is defined in kernel/latency.c, there's no way for any other
arch to call it).
