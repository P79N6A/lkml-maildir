I'm having a devil of a time finding the tcpblast sources on the
net, can you point me to where I can get them?  The one reference
I saw to get the original sources was:
ftp://ftp.xlink.net/pub/network/tcpblast.shar.gz
But even that directory no longer exists.
The kernel error you see is a gross fatal error, the TCP retransmit
timer has fired yet there are no packets on the transmit queue :-)
My current theory is that tcpblast does something erratic when the
error occurs.
