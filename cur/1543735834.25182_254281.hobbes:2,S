In acpi_eject_store(), eject_operation() is called regardless of the
result of acpi_bus_trim().  I think that eject_operation() should be
called only when acpi_bus_trim() returns success.  Otherwise, a
device stil being online will be ejected forcibly.
Two steps might be needed to do this.
    1. Modify acpi_bus_trim() to return success only when all the
        acpi_bus_remove() are done successfully.
    2. Modify acpi_eject_store() to see the result and call eject_operation()
        only when the result is success.
Here is a patch just to show what I have in mind.  It is still based on
the recursion, so please fix it as appropriate ;)
Thanks,
Keiichiro Tokunaga
