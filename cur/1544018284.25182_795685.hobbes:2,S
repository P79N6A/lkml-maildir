Thanks Avuton - i've updated the commit with your Tested-by tag, see the 
final commit below.

Subject: [PATCH] x86: unmask CPUID levels on Intel CPUs
Impact: Fixes crashes with misconfigured BIOSes on XSAVE hardware
Avuton Olrich reported early boot crashes with v2.6.28 and
bisected it down to dc1e35c6e95e8923cf1d3510438b63c600fee1e2
("x86, xsave: enable xsave/xrstor on cpus with xsave support").
If the CPUID limit bit in MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE is set, clear it to
make all CPUID information available.  This is required for some
features to work, in particular XSAVE.
