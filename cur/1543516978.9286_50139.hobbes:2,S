Hello,
my Advance 2941U Ultra-SCSI Controller (ACARD/AEC6712U/ATP870UW-C)
does not work, not as modul and not resident in the kernel (RH 6.0,
Kernel 2.2.13/2.2.14pre)
Always the same error message:

What I have done now is: I have replaced atp870u.c/atp870u.h in the
kernel-source ( 2.2.13/2.2.14pre) by the driver provided in
redhat60.zip, which can be
found on www.acard.com. This driver seems to work without problems under
2.2.13/2.2.14pre, but only resident in the kernel, not as module
(similar errors like above).
(Should I use this old driver with 2.2.13/2.2.14pre till the driver
provided by the kernel-source works for me (the old one was for 2.2.5)?)
Regards,
                  Wolfgang
