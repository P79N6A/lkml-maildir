My system has issues running adma mode with sata_nv.  I have an nforce4 
motherboard.
What is the current status of this problem?
Is there any information I can provide to help debug it?
I gave up trying various fixes about 6 months ago, and put "sata_nv.adma=0" on 
the kernel command line in LILO, and that fixed the problem.
However, recently I changed distributions and went back to 2.6.20 (kubuntu 7.04).
This kernel says that sata_nv.adma=0 is an invalid kernel option.
I'm pretty puzzled by that, because it is supposed to disable adma mode in the 
sata_nv driver.
/proc/cmdline says:
root=<hash> ro sata_nv.adma=0 quiet splash
...so it seems I did give the parameter properly.
Any ideas appreciated.
Is there a better way to deal with this?
Also, one more: does it hurt to wait until the sata_nv driver fails a few 
times (at which point it stops bitching) and use the machine?  Once it
fails about 6 times, I no longer have any issues, and speed is still good 
enough to use until a real fix can be had.
Thanks.
