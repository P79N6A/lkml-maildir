Hello everyone!
I have an update on the reproduction of the strange kernel oopses on an
2.4.24 kernel.

> Jan  6 22:39:01 Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt
That's the message, that always appears.
We then tested around as described in my original mail.

The kernel ran for four days without crashing. So I tried to activate
some options, that were activeted in the crashing kernel.
I started with this option, just by a foresought.
> < CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y
> ---
> > # CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW is not set
It was not set in the kernel running for four days, but in the one,
crashing. After I activated it (means: CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y),
compiled the kernel and let it run under work for the weekend (starting
on friday). This morning (monday) it crashed. So I would say, it was the
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW.
Does anyone have an idea, why this options makes the kernel crash?
Shouldn't this option prevent the kernel from crashing?
If more information is needed (i.e. full kernel config, hardware specs,
etc.) please let me know.
Regards
Kai
