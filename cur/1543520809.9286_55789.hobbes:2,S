This question has been asked before...search engines find it...but no
answers.
Lately, kernels in the range 2.3.25 - 2.3.35 hang on startup or start
strangly
while 2.2.13 works fine.
The symptoms include
    hanging after the "starting init" message, but alt/sysrq keys work
    a stream of "VM killing process modprobe" messages
    one "VM kill process modprobe message" and then hang
The later kernels hang hard, but ~2.3.31 put out the stream of messages
My machine is a p3-266 uniprocessor, 64MB, ide disks, RH 6.0 with updates
to RH 6.1 rpm's.  Options in .config include initrd.
ideas for what to try???
