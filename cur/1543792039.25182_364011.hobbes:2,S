Well..  sort of.   Thinking goes probably like this:
  "The GART is AGP thingie, it shall be initialized minimally
   or not at all in a system that has no AGP."
which naturally backfires, when indeed all IO bus things will
use GART, not only AGP..
I am using Fedora Core development kernels for x86_64, and am able
to get system to work (mostly) with all 4 GB of memory by using
following boot parameters:
    iommu=soft swiotlb=65536
with all of 2.6.14 series kernel versions for past week (or two).
I did try some other options as well, like:
    iommu=noagp,force,memaper=3
but that didn't succeed in booting my box all the way, and always
in the end crashing with the message in $SUBJECT, above.
Plain 2.4.14 works completely with   mem=2600M  boot-option, but
it does still tell:
    Checking aperture...
    CPU 0: aperture @ 0 size 32 MB
    No AGP bridge found
and somewhere (AMD documents?) I spotted a mention that having
aperture overlaying memory is "a bad idea", thus when memory
starts at zero, and aperture starts there... 
A quirk, very least.
There is separate issue with recent change in  mm/memory.c
contained   get_user_pages()  function (?) that fail my
BTTV card access  --  and I might be wrong again,  I did
suspect I2C at first, but strace shows fault to happen with
VIDIOC_QBUF  ioctl...
