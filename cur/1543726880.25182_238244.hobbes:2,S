On my own desktop system with 1GB RAM, any highmem slowdown seems to be
outweighed by the fact that more disk data stays cached in RAM (so I hit
the disk much less often).
Everyone else I know has also found the extra RAM to greatly outweigh
the highmem slowdown, although those people are running clusters &
servers, not desktops, with this much RAM.
