Now you are entering really dangerous territory.
If you can implement a meaningfull sync method, you must have dirty
pages in the page cache. That means you are in the page freeing path
of the vm. Then we are in real trouble. Don't even think about it.
As far as suspend/hibernate is concerned, get yourself on the new
notifying chain and revert to synchronous operations when notified.
