CLUSTERED_APIC_NONE is the normal default mode of flat logical (defined in asm/smpboot.h)
NUMAQ, Summit has a OEM field check and they change it to Cluster or Physical mode
before this point. What I am trying here is to check whether we are still in the default
flat (with max 8 cpu) mode, and we have more than 8 xAPIC supporting CPUs, then
we switch to physical mode rather than flat mode.

Unfortunately, this patch doesn't do that. My initial attempt (first version of
the patch that I had sent) was trying to set up clustered physical mode for all non-NUMAQ
systems, with more than 8 CPUs with xAPIC support. But due to the amount of code changes
that it involved, we had to fall back to setting up such systems in physical mode, 
with IO-APIC programmed for fixed Priority interrupt.
