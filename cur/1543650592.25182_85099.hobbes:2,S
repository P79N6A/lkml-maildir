With out some amount of output I don't have a clue.
With just the first patch it doesn't work on SMP, but I don't try it to see
what the failure mode was.
With the second patch all should be the same except the legacy pic actually
gets disabled.  I wonder if disabling the legacy pic locks your system?
There should be two printks one about shuting down devices,
and another about kexecing the image.  And knowing when which of those
printed could be useful.
In any event.  Remove the shutdown routine in arch/i386/kernel/i8259.c
That should restore the kernel to it's previous behavior if something really changed...
 static struct device_driver i8259A_driver = {
 	.name		= "pic",
 	.bus		= &system_bus_type,
 	.resume		= i8259A_resume,
- 	.shutdown	= i8259A_shutdown,
 };
Or you could try it with a uniprocessor kernel and just the first patch.
