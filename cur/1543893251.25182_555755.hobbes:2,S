If you read the thread you'll find another bizarre fact: my laptop
only saw acpi_pm lose time when running a 64-bit kernel. With the
32-bit kernel acpi_pm worked fine in C2.
The C1 workaround is what the ACPI folks came up with. I was reluctant
to use it at first, but haven't really noticed any negative effects.
