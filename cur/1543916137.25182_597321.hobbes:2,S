No. The requirement for 'hard' mounts is not that the server be up all
the time. The server can go up and down as it pleases: the client can
happily recover from that.
The requirement is rather that nobody remove it permanently before the
application is done with it, and the partition is unmounted. That is
hardly unreasonable (it is the only way I know of to ensure data
integrity), and it is much less strict than the requirements for local
disks.
