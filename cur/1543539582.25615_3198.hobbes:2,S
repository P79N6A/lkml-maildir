And if they get root and do a "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda" I'm toast
too. Disable dd(1), cp(1), echo(1), ... for that reason?
I'm assuming the relevant ioctls are protected by the standard
permissions, so (given sane permissions) only root can blow away the disk.
If a cracker gets root, I'm toast. If the ioctls are "protected" by the
kernel, they'll just do them the hard way.  What's new there? 
Sure, if the kernel does wrong stuff it has to be fixed. If the user does
idiotic stuff, it's his/her problem. Unix has always worked that way, and I
like it exactly for that general reason.
