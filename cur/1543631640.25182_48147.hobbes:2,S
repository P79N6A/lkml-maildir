It seems to me that the biggest issue here is maintaining
POSIX behavior without having to modify application source
every time the flag set changes.
Perhaps a POSIX bitmask could be defined.
For a degree of binary compatibility a few unused flags
could be reserved and the POSIX bitmask include them
whether they had meaning yet or not.
