Subject: Patch to remove undefined C code

This patch has many bogus corrections where new variables were created, but
the order of evaluation is already unambiguous.
For example each comma separated clause in an expression is guaranteed to be
completely evaluated before the next comma separated clause Including
Assignments.
It seems as if about half of the patched code simply makes it easier for the
inexperienced C programmer to understand without actually fixing linguistic
ambiguities, and at the same time introducing new variables which will
clutter up the registers and the cache lines.  Please don't apply this patch
without consideration.
