BTW, even though the original patch is already merged, I think that
we ought to get rid of do-while in such stubs, exactly to avoid such
problems in the future.  Probably even add to CodingStyle - it's not
the first time such crap happens.
IOW, do ; while(0) / do { } while (0)  is not a proper way to do a macro
that imitates a function returning void.
Objections?
