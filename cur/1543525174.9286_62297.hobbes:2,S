it's not necesserily a bug (in fact it's a valid scenario) - are these
messages also accompanied by bad application behavior or kernel crashes?
if you still see problems then you might want to try Manfred's debugging
patchset he sent yesterday.
If no real problems apart from these messages, then could you apply
smp-2.3.43-E1 (attached) to pre8-2.3.43, it removes some paranoia and
debugging stuff. (also fixes the small window for a deadlock scenario
Manfred noticed, plus does the tlb_state initialization at compile time)
(pre8 already includes Stephen's fix as well)
