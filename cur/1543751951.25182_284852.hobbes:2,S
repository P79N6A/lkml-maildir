i agree that there's a race. I solved this in the -RT patchset a couple
of weeks ago, but in a different wasy. I introduced the
preempt_schedule_irq() function and this solves the problem via keeping
the whole IRQ-preemption path irqs-off. This has the advantage that if
an IRQ signals preemption of a task and the kernel is immediately
preemptable then we are able to hit that task atomically without
re-enabling IRQs again. I'll split out this patch - can you see any
problems with the preempt_schedule_irq() approach?
