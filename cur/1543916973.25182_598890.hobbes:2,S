Ok, here's a patch that fixes this for me.  It should go on top of the
-mm tree.  Let me know of this works or not.
In the end, we need to dynamically allocate these subsystems to properly
fix this.  In looking through the tree, there really isn't that many of
them, so I'll try to knock that out later this week.
