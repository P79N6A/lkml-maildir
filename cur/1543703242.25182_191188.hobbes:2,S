I have coded both - it was a simple matter of replacing each:
  wordp[i]
with:
  wordp[M32X(i)]
where M32X (for "Mask 32-bit indeX") is defined:
#include <asm/byteorder.h>
#if BITS_PER_LONG == 64 && defined(__BIG_ENDIAN)
#define M32X(i) ((i)^1)
#elif BITS_PER_LONG == 32 || defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN)
#define M32X(i) (i)
#endif
I spent more time writing the comments explaining it than I did writing
the code.
