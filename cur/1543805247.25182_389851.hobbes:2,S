- Except on laptops where you usually can't add *any* RAM. And if you
  can, it is *much much* more expensive than on "normal" PCs.
- Except if you - for whatever reason - have to throw out smaller RAMs
  to get larger (and much more expensive) RAMs into it.
- Except (as someone else mentioned) you have already equipped your main
  board to the max.

ACK. X, evolution and Mozilla family (to name standard apps) are the
exceptions to this rule.
