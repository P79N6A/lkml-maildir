once you break the seal the device is no longer certified. an uncertified 
device cannot be used.
this is very common (in some areas it's widely ignored, in others it 
isn't)
this is just like the 'you void the warranty if you disrupt this sticker' 
stickers that you see on just about any hardware you buy today. some 
vendors are stickers for this, others don't really care.
