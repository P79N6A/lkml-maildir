How would you prevent tasks from being scheduled?  How would you
prevent drivers from deadlocking because in order to put their device
in a low-power state they need to acquire a lock which is held by a
user task?

I can't say for sure.  That's the way we have been doing it.  It
wouldn't be easy to change, because the driver would have to busy-wait
during delays -- which would mean it would need to use different code
for system-wide suspend and runtime suspend.
