Subject: Possible S3 FrameBuffer Problem?

Hi,
I just downloaded the patch for S3 Framebuffer and applied it. I own a
Diamond Stealth VRam (968) and everything went absolutely smooth and I did
get to see the penguin boot logo. The problems came up when I launched the
X-Server (3.3.1), because when I leave X-Windows the whole screen is
filled up with vertical lines and on every tty. 
Am I supposed to use XFBDev ? I don't think so, becuase on my other
machine, which is equipped with a matrox g200, everything is fine
(framebuffer+xserver). If more infos are needed don't hesitate to contact
me.
Best Regards
Michele Baldessari
