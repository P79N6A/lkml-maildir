And both implementations suffer from the fact that if tsk->comm
were to change from a fixed length array to a char*, allowing
arbitrarily sized names, you would end up copying very little
indeed.  :)  What not something more general like:
char * safe_strncpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t size)
{
    dst[size-1] = '\0';
    strncpy(dst, src, size-1);
}
