Actually, it does exist as part of the rainbow series under object reuse.
I have a copy of the current renewed memo draft + addendum (this year) for
purging.
No change.

Absolutely - the only people that can still retrieve data are the data
recovery companies out there (even fire doesn't fully erase the data unless
above 2-3,000 degrees). Tunneling magnetic microscopes are amazing at
data retrieval. Polishing off the top layer even allows reading some data
recorded many times earlier, though the newer thin film surfaces make this
harder.
