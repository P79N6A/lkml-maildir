Partially true for us.  We do do patent searches to make sure we aren't
doing anything blatently stupid.
I do agree with you 100% that it is impossible to ship any software that
does not infringe on some patent.  It's a big point of contention in 
contract negotiations because everyone wants you to warrant that your
software doesn't infringe and indemnify them if it does.
