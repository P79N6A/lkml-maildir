While we are talking bttv, do we have support for the Teppro cards? They
are very popular here (Australia). I use it as
	options bttv  card=3 pll=2
	options tuner type=5
but the "mute" work in reverse. Also, the volume control has no effect
(should it if I do not run the sound through my soundcard, i.e. does the
bttv have it's own volume control?).
I can test it if anyone knows how to fix it. I have the TEV560.
