Oh, I basically agree, _except_ that Al Viro has these ideas pending for
2.5.x that basically create a "process capability cache" that is a cache
of all the process ID's and capabilities (ie uid, gid, groups etc). Which
would be this copy-on-write thing.
And that may end up mixing well with a "CLONE_CAPABILITIES" flag.
Which is not to say that this will necessarily get done. But other changes
may make it an option. I was just saying that if done that way, it would
be a CLONE_xxxx flag instead of "we will use the thread leaders ID" thing.

Yes. For 2.4.x, I'd love to fix anything that can be used to show real
performance bugs. Something like "setuid() is slow when I run it threaded
is not a real issue". Something like "pthreads is faster under NT than
under Linux" _would_ be a real issue.
