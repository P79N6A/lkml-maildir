Right, should have looked the name up.

I did not read it, neither did I read BitKeeper's code for 
obvious reasons.

Only one more, unless I missed something.

Indeed, but unfortunately you don't hit the problem with 
pure ASCII on x86. That's one of the reasons for which 
a lot of code ported to archs where char is unsigned by
default is simply compiled with -fsigned-char instead of 
correcting the bugs. 
The remaining case (char 0xff) is infrequent, at least 
for Latin-[19] encodings in the languages I know, and 
never happens with UTF-8 AFAICT. 
Heck, even the 2.4 ppc kernel is compiled with 
-fsigned-char, for $DEITY's sake.
