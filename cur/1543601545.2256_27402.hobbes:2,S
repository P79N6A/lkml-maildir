Think again.
It seems to fix the stability problem. We don;t know why, but
experimetation shows that those _with_ the problem are relieved. This is
fine! We are happy with it.
We write to a register marked as "don't write" by Via. This is potentialy 
dangerous in ways we don't know yet.

How can you know you need it if it is enabled by default. I see many more
ppl just not being bothered enough to check. 
And then, would you prefer having somebody naging about, say, his
northbirdge melting down after 10mins with K7 optimizations enabled?
-K.
