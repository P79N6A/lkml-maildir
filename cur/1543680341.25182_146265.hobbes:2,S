Thanks, this works for me.  I had tried the Synaptics driver also, but with
the psmouse_noext option set which didn't work.  It should be noted
somewhere (in the config help?) that the 2.4 behavior of just being able to
use the psaux device with the default X driver no longer works.
Now that this is taken care of and I have ported my 802.11a/b/g wireless
adapter's driver to use 2.5 I can try to use 2.5 full time.  I take it's
about that time when the kernel folks want non-kernel folks to start
banging on 2.5 (soon to be 2.6pre) and send the lkml problem reports,
correct?
Thank you,
Carl Thompson
