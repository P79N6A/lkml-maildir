Some progress.
I added a "%#x" to the printk for the "..driver lost sync.." message,
and got these results logged:-
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x18)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0xff)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x18)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0xff)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x18)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0xfe)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
Pressing one of the left buttons gives:-
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x9)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
and releasing it:-
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x8)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
while wiping a finger across the pad:-
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x8)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x1)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x8)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x3)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x1)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x8)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x2)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x8)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x2)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x28)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x3)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0xff)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x28)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x2)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0xff)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x8)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x4)
 kernel: Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte(0x0)
... (lots more)
It looks like the protocol is three bytes per 'event' and the nibbles
have been swapped in the bytes from this touchpad!
Mike.
