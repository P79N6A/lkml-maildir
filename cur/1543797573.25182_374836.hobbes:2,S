I was fine with the sequence you are describing above. The only thing
which was worrying me was platform_device_add_resources(), until I
realized that this function was really only preparing the resources for
reservation. For some reason I was erroneously thinking that it was
also requesting the resources "for real", so I was worried that
platform_device_put wouldn't release these if platform_device_add was
failing.
This all makes sense to me now. Thanks for the clarification, and sorry
for being a bit slow to figure out how the platform stuff works.
I'll post the platform driver I am currently working on later today for
comments. I'm pretty sure I'm still not using the platform
infrastructure the way it was meant to be, and would appreciate hints on
how I can do it better.
Thanks again,
