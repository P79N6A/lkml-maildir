hello
i have been getting some (i thought) kernel lockups. only a hard reset would
help. originally i thought it was the emu10k1 sb live driver, and i read
that 2.4.7 didn't have the problem (i was using 2.4.8). i also tried using
alsa, which didn't work either.
however, after seeing it still happening, i am led to believe that it may
be some power management problem or not a kernel problem at all...
(in which case this mailing list is NOT where i should be posting,
sorry for the distraction if i am wrong). the lockup only happens after
extended periods of idle time (specifically in the morning after a night
of not using the computer). the sysrq works, so i guess it isn't a hard
lockup? if it is kernel...what then? if not...what could be the problem?
thx
