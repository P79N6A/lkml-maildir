Hi Nick,
I stumbled over a problem in the sched_domain code in regard to
zSeries (s390). The problem seems to have been introduced by
ChangeSet 1.1837.3.11: [PATCH] sched: consolidate sched domains.
With z/VM it is possible to start with a small set of cpus and
later on add more if you need them. If I try to online one of
the "late" cpus the scheduler crashes in find_busiest group
because the sched_group for the late cpu is not in the linked
list of sched_groups (group->next is NULL at sched.c:4770).
I worked around that problem with the attached patch. Dunno if
this is the right way to do it but it works for me.
blue skies,
  Martin.
