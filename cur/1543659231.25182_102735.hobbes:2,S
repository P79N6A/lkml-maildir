Believe me when I say, I'm learning a lot from these discussions.  Hey,
that's what I'm here for.  And that's what the list is about in some
respect (discussion).  Call me a troll if you want, call me a cockroach
if it makes you feel better.  I don't care.  But in the end, I'm saying
what I think is right, and when I'm wrong, I'm learning the whys.  If I
still think I'm right, I'm saying so, and people explain vividly exactly
why it is that I'm wrong, and believe it or not, I do learn.  Sometimes
I learn at a different rate than others, but that's only because I have
a different background and a different set of learning disabilities.
