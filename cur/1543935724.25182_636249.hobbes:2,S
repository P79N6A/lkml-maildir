Hi Ingo,
I will watch this during the experiments.  I have been using klog
application to dump relayfs data.  I did run powertop and top as well,
I will bind them to certain CPUs and isolate their impact.
I believe the margin of error would be less since all the measurement
tasks sleep for long duration.
Thanks,
Vaidy
