hm.  Yes, it's hard to see how this structure can grow much larger.
But we'll be stuck for all time with a weird interface, just because once back
in August of '04 we didn't want to patch 129 files.

That's OK - it's just an hour's work.  I'd be more concerned about
irritating people who are maintaining and using out-of-tree drivers.

confusion" sounds like something which is very optional.  I'd be opting to
go do something else instead ;)
