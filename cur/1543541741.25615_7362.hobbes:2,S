I have had 2.4.0-test3 (plus the linux-2.4.0-test3-reiserfs-3.6.11
patch) running for 9 hours now. I cannot reproduce the problem with
this kernel. This is consistent with my original observation that the
problem started with the test4 kernel. Even though my system has been
very lightly loaded, as I recall it the problem showed up right away.
My vger mailing-list subscriptions are routed into INN, and during
that time I have received a total of 95 mails. 7 went to my
linux-admin newsgroup, 86 to linux-kernel. 2 were rejected by INN
because they contained binary attachments.
The INN "active" file contents match this perfectly, and is updated
correctly. I do notice that the timestamp of the active file is NOT
updated - but I don't know if it is supposed to be like that. The
corruption of ".overview" files does not happen either.
(I keep a copy of the mails received from vger, before I start feeding
them into the mail-to-news gateway. So even if INN was losing mails, I
would notice by cross-checking with the mail-archive).
So if Anton is seeing it with one of the test1-ac kernels, that might
be worth looking into.
I'll start going through the -test4 kernels now, trying to pin-point
exactly when the problem-code was introduced.
Regards,
Henrik
