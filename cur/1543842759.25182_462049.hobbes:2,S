Forget it, this thing does not support 4MB pages, and swsusp currently
needs them. (We'll need to fix that, but not now -- fix is port of
page-table handling code from x86-64).
It should die with
        if (!cpu_has_pse) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "PSE is required for swsusp.\n");
                return -EPERM;
        }
...can you investigate why it does not?
