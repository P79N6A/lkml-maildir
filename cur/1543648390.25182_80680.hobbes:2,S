  In perfect world yes, but in reality there is overhead.  I've tested 
this on a quad xeon.  A "make bzImage" is a bit faster with 
hyperthreading off.  Of course a make -j 8 bzImage is faster with 
hyperthreading on.  I haven't tried this on a dual xeon.  (It could be a 
scaling issue 4 vs 8 processors.)

And if both threads need different items in L(whatever) cache it gets 
even worse.
There are a few good overviews on the subject:
