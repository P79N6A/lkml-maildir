It says the scheduling policy will decide who gets the mutex. It does 
not say that such a decision must be made immediately. That seems rather 
implementation defined to me.

This is nothing to do with the thread scheduler being inefficient. It is 
inherently inefficient to context-switch repeatedly no matter how good 
the kernel is. It trashes the CPU pipeline, at the very least, can cause 
thrashing of the CPU caches, and can cause cache lines to be pushed back 
and forth across the bus on SMP machines which really kills performance.
