Yes, a userspace solution that makes use of the existing kernel random
number source if needed.

There is probably a lot in the kernel that can (and a lot that should) be
done in userspace (although I'm not sure /dev/zero is one of them).
This doesn't mean having them in the kernel is a good idea because they are
handy. I'm not passing judgement on your module though - I was just 
wondering
why it is in kernel.

Although we do have 2 types of random number sources in the kernel. I'm not
sure we'd want to keep adding them as the need arises. Maybe if it were 
a very
general and configurable one, but AFAIKS frandom is not.
