That certainly is the underlying intent, but the government does not want
to formally define Canadian rules in terms of somebody else's.  What the
rules say, as best I could figure them out (I wasn't trying hard), is that
*everything* of US origin is subject to Canadian export controls, except
for (numerous) things for which the paperwork is explicitly waived by
subsidiary documents.  Same effect, but they don't have to say it out loud.

Only within the US, the one place where the export rules were not an issue.
