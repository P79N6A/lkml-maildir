I think it's a bug in dev.c:
--- linux/net/core/dev.c~	Sun Feb 27 17:53:51 2000
+++ linux/net/core/dev.c	Sun Feb 27 17:54:06 2000
@@ -2128,6 +2128,7 @@
 				dev->iflink = dev->ifindex;
 			if (dev->rebuild_header == NULL)
 				dev->rebuild_header = default_rebuild_header;
+			set_bit(__LINK_STATE_PRESENT, &dev->state);
 			dev_init_scheduler(dev);
 		}
 	}
It would be nice if this code and the code in register_netdevice could be
unified in some common function..
Tim.
