Hands up...how many of you ext2fs corruption folks are NOT using Aladdin IV
chipsets? I don't recall many people mentioning their MB hardware, but the
ones I _do_ recall had these (P5A and friends). Also, bus speed. Some of you
folks have PC100 RAM, but are you actually clocking the bus at 100Mhz? Or only
66?
