The only change visible outside kernel/timer.c is:
 static inline int timer_pending(const struct timer_list * timer)
 {
-	return timer->base != NULL;
+	return timer->base & 1;
 }
Currently __get_base() usage in the kernel/time.c suboptimal and
should be cleanuped, I see no other problems with performance.

I think that separate timer->pending field will require more changes,
because we can't read/write base+pending atomically.
int del_timer()
{
again:
	if (!timer->pending)	// not strictly necessary, but it is
		return 0;	// nice to avoid locking
	base = timer->base;
	if (!base)
		return 0;
	spin_lock(base->lock);
	if (!timer->pending) {
		spin_unlock();
		goto again;
	}
	if (timer->base != base) {
		spin_unlock();
		goto again;
	}
	....	
}
Note also, that we have to audit every timer->base usage anyway,
because currently it mix base and pending.
But may be you are right, the encoding of a bit in a pointer is
indeed weird.
Oleg.
