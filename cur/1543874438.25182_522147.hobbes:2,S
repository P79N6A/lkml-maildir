So it would be something like:
    pda.intr_mask = 1;		/* disable interrupts */
    ...
    pda.intr_mask = 0;		/* enable interrupts */
    if (xchg(&pda.intr_pending, 0))	/* check pending */
    	asm("sti");		/* was pending; isr left cpu interrupts masked */
      
and in the interrupt handler:
    if (pda.intr_mask) {
    	pda.intr_pending = 1;
    	regs->eflags &= ~IF;
    	maybe_ack_interrupt_controller();
    	iret
      
    }
?
