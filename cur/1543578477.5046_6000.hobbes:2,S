When copying huge files from one disk to another (hda->hdc), I get the
following error (after some hundred megabytes):
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd1 { Busy }
hdc: DMA disabled
ide1: reset: success
I got this using dd with a block size of 32kB, reading a large file on
hda, writing directly to hdc1.  I tried with another disk as hdc
(a Samsung), and I have tried two different cables.  Still no go.  Well,
it does work, of course, but much slower since DMA has been disabled.
I have been unable to reproduce this error using
	dd bs=32k if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdc1
or
	dd bs=32k if=/dev/hdc1 of=/dev/null
Everything works fine in 2.2.16-22 from RedHat 7 (with DMA enabled using
hdparm).
Here is a relevant part of the startup log (I hope):
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31

Did I miss anything?
