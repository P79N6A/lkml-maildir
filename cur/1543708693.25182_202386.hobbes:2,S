Rik had a patch in rhel3 for nonroot mlock() which made this all work,
I will post a patch for 2.6. from what I understand it's very useful for
the gpg folks to have, eg wide audience for this patch. just need to do
a bit more testing and having Rik review it then ll send it out (or
maybe he feels like getting shot and he will ;)
