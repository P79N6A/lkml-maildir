This breaks consumers of notify_die() relying on the proper trap number being
passed, as the call to notify_die() from die() currently reads
current->thread.trap_no.
Also, you seem to leave other places where trap_no gets set untouched -
is this intentional (do_debug - probably correct here, kernel_math_error -
probably incorrect here)?

Likewise.
