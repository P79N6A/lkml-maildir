Dear Friend,
I am a citizen of switzerland  temporarily living and working in Standard
Chartered Bank ,Hong Kong.
I have a proposal to discuss about a late Client of mine who I think is
co-incidentally related to you, on fixed
deposit in my bank.
Please contact me for further information about this business.
Thank you.
 Mr Javi Greg.
