If you just needed to keep an ordered queue for each resource, things
would be easy.  My example shows that when a process blocks on one
resource, it potentially must traverse the wait queues associated with 
an arbitrary number of other resources.

I know how things work in the
simple case.  The simple case is not the problem.
