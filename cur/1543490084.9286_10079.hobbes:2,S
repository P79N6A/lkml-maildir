Hi,
I used to have a plextor 12x scsi internal (worked fine) but now I'm 
stuck with an external nec 6x scsi.  xcdroast doesn't seem
to recognize an cd's which I have inside the cdrom.  I can
mount the cdrom on it but I noticed that in dmesg that
it says that there are illegal requests before hand.
sr1: CDROM (ioctl) reports ILLEGAL REQUEST.

I'm using an adaptec 2940 ultra pci scsi on a Tyan board with
an AMD K6-2 350.  Also I'm using Red Hat 5.2 with all the updated rpms
as of this writing and kernel 2.2.3.
I'm wondering if the illegal requests are what's causing xcdroast to fail.
Thanks,
Tuan
