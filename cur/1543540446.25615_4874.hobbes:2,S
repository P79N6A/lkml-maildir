I guess the heads (do they actually graze over the parking track, or
do the arms lean on something when the disk is speeding up/slowing
down?), the bearings of the disk and the disk engine suffer the most
from spinup/down. What has that got to do with vibration or shocks?
Sometimes a disk in a server runs for ages. If the disk is spun down, it
sometimes never comes up again. What might be a technical reason for
this? I've heard something about 'dust' which collects at the parking
track, and in which the heads will kill themselves.
And if a disk dies at the end of it's lifetime (not disk crash), what is
the part that fails? The engine? The heads? The bearings? The servo? The
electronics?
Thanx!

Ps, is the parking track equal to track 0, and is the parking track near
the center or at the edge of a disk?
