ah, that would explain it...

Nope, there was nothing in the logs.

Telnet's disabled anyways :) Cleartext passwords SUCK. :)
I've got a nifty LCD thingy I can hook up to the serial port and use as a
console if need be.

I'm not about to convert my filesystems over... It's too much a hassle for

Thanks for the help though
