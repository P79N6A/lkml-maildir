Humm, I wondering out loud if this is the video dma failure in tvtime?
Anyway, it applied cleanly over -33, and is building now, set for 
mode=4.
Rebooted, running it now, and no, this wasn't it, tvtime still has a 
BSOD with good audio.  However, where before I got about 4-6 cx88 
interrupts for a short run of tvtime each time I ran it, now I'm 
showing only 4 regardless.  Even if I leave it runnng, the count is 
stuck at 4.
I wonder if those 4 are associated with the initial insmod?
I've rmmod cx8800 cx88-dvb, then modprobe cx88-dvb which then shows 
the cx8800 module (unused) in an lsmod, but a cat of /proc/interrupts 
now shows 2 of them:
17:          4  IO-APIC-level  [........../  0]  cx88[0], cx88[0]
But I'll run this for a bit & see what else falls off on the 
curves. :)
