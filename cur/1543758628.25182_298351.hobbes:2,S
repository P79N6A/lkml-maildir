Yes, serial_cs is claiming that we don't have a device associated with
the port, so we're treating it as a legacy port.  However, serial_cs is
implementing the suspend/resume methods.  This is wrong, since that
means the port will be suspended twice, and hence causes this bug.
serial_cs needs to register the ports along with the PCMCIA device with
which the port belongs to.  This will stop it being treated as a legacy
serial port.
Unfortunately, it's too late tonight for me to dig into PCMCIA to work
out how we get at the device structure - I can't find any examples off
hand either.  Therefore, it may be a while before I can produce a patch
to resolve this.
