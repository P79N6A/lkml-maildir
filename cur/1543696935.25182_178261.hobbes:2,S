Subject: great AGP related stability achievements with 2.6.0 vs. 2.4.18+

I want to congratulate whoever is involved...
I use the relatively new Asus A7N8X mainboard (based on the nVidia nForce2 
chipset) and nVidia based AGP graphics card.
With this setup and plain Debian "unstable" 2.4.18 up to 2.4.22 kernels, 
this machine got locked up at least once a day, in a seamingly random way. 
Lowering memory or CPU frequency in BIOS from default to more generous 
levels improved stability somewhat, but it still remained at intolerable 
levels. (With lock up I mean not even Magic SysRq works.) 
Changing the graphics card from AGP to PCI (to Matrox) solved the issue 
with kernel 2.4.18+ but I wanted to have an AGP card. Other AGP cards 
caused problems too (TNT2), although they proved less unstable (1 crash in 
2-3 days). This also helped to exclude other issues such as IDE DMA or bad 
memory from consideration (I checked the hardware thoroughly).
Kernel 2.6.0 hasn't crashed on me once for weeks, although I use exactly 
the same hardware now (see below). It is just stable. 
I do not load the agpgart and related modules, but I didn't load them with 
2.4.18-2.4.22 either.
