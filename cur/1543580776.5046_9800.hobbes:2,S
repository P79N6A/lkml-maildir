 It's just the matter of the order I/O APICs are listed in the MP table. 
I think it's only the limited number of multiple-I/O APIC systems
available so far that prevented from a reverse listing to happen.  Given
recent developments which lead to more such systems (e.g. using the
infamous ServerWorks chipset which embeds two I/O APICs internally), it's
only the matter of time until this happens, I'm afraid. 
 No need to hurry, though -- we might fix the problem once (if) it
appears.
