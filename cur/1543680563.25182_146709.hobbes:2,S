Yes, it worked with 2.5.70 kernel with the proper mjb patch. I had 
to change root=LABEL=/ token to root=/dev/sda2 one in order to 
make the system boot from SCSI disk. Also, I compiled AIC7XXX 
drivers statically into the kernel.
I tried to do the same trick for 2.4.21 kernel, but it seemed not to 
help. I didn't play with it for too long though. I indend to experiment 
with 2.4.21 kernel in about a week after I finish with 2.5.70, which 
is currently working for me.
Thanks a lot for the help
