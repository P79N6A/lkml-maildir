I notice that the kernel ethernet bridging code got a few healthy changes
in 2.2.14.  (And yet the 2.3.x code has yet to be updated.)
The changes by Matthew Grant mention an updated brcfg, which seems to add
to the list of versions of that code floating around.  Where can a version
of brcfg that works with 2.2.14 be found?  (Or save that, a version of
brcfg that works with anything?  None of the versions I've tried do much
of anything besides segfault.)
