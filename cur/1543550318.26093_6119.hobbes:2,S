No, that's not what I'm saying.  The master is a traditional ATA disk
and the _slave_ is a flash disk:
hda: IBM-DMCA-21440, ATA DISK drive
hdb: SunDisk SDTB-128, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: 2822400 sectors (1445 MB) w/96KiB Cache, CHS=700/64/63
hdb: 31360 sectors (16 MB) w/1KiB Cache, CHS=490/2/32
Take a look at the patch (it only changes two lines).  It's pretty clear
what it fixes.
