Several are very probably faulty as NAND flashes initially already have
bad blocks (but there a re some more on that chip to compensate for
that).
Even if just 1 of a squillion (erase-)blocks is gone. But that's now and
only the first. More to follow sooner or later .....
I don't think that "writing to swap space" is in any way limited or
minimized but assumes normal harddisks. So it is not like you are
writing to the flash chip only on "save in some UI or on a firmware
update.

Yes, that's the idea. Nevertheless it places "load" on the flash chips.
Actually I'm curious how fats it is and how well it works (and with
which flash chips exactly) if one simply tries it out. If it actually
works.
