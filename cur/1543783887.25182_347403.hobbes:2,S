That is incorrect, and you're contradicting yourself here:

The Cluster Volume Management of LVM2 for example _does_ use simple
cluster-wide locks, and some OCFS2 scripts, I seem to recall, do too.
(EVMS2 in cluster-mode uses a verrry simple locking scheme which is
basically operated by the failover software and thus uses a different
model.)
