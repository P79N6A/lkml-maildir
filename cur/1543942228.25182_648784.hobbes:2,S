But the kernel shouldn't try to assign a resource in the 64 bits space
to a card behind a bridge... at least not a non-prefetchable resource
since those can't be forwarded (P2P bridges only define a 32 bits window
for non-prefetchable resources).
So it does look to me like the kernel may be doing something wrong. I
haven't had a chance to look at the logs in details yet (just woke up).
