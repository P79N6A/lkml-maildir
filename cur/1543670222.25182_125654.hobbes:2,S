This is not necessarily a slot-by-slot question, but whether the entire 
PCI/AGP buses will lose power during the sleep state, right? 
There are a couple of things to note. 
This is only an issue when doing suspend-to-RAM. Suspend-to-disk, and
power-on suspend will definitely lose power and definitely not lose any
power, respectively. So, you need a mechanism to determine what state the 
system is entering. 
Next, once you determine that we're entering suspend-to-RAM, you need to
know if the buses will lose power. In order to have a generic suspend
sequence, there must be a set of platform-specific methods to do all the
fun platform things that must be done. In that object, we can easily add a
flag that specifies whether or not the platform will lose power. This flag
can be initialized based on platform knowledge on startup.
In short, there should be no problems. Hopefully, I should have something 
within the week to review/test. (Yeah yeah, talk is cheap, but I'm getting 
there).
