Hi Justin ! What is the actual breakage here ? Is this just PCI write
posting ? (that is PCI writes staying in bridge write buffer for
some time until you flush the whole path with a read). In this
case those intel & VIA chipsets aren't at fault as this is perfectly
legal per PCI spec and we'll have problem with all other sort of
machines, especially machines with stacked PCI<->PCI bridges like
it's the case for most pmacs.
Or is there a real Intel/VIA bug regarding PCI write buffers ?
I doubt it would affect only Adaptec cards then...
Ben.
