AFAICS, when in ADMA mode, you absolutely should not touch the ATA 
shadow registers at all.
This is normal for all controllers with both a "legacy mode" and an 
"enhanced DMA mode" of some sort:  the internal silicon state machines 
"own" the ATA shadow registers while in enhanced DMA mode.  Reading or 
writing the ATA shadow registers while in enhanced DMA mode can lead to 
undefined results, running the gamut from no-op to data corruption and 
hardware lock-ups.
You may only access the ATA shadow registers when NV_ADMA_CTL_GO is 
cleared, and then NV_ADMA_STAT_LEGACY is set, indicating the NVIDIA chip 
is in register mode (aka legacy mode).
