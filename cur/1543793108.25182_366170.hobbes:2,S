Well, you could do the feature discovery by trying to take a fault early 
at boot-time. That's how we verify that write-protect works, and how we 
check that math exceptions come in the right way..

Not so evil - I think it's been discussed. Not with alternates (not worth 
it), but it wouldn't be hard to do: just add a new section for "lock 
address", and have each inline asm that does a lock prefix do basically
	1:
		lock ; xyzzy
	.section .lock.address
	.long 1b
	.previous
and then just walk the ".lock.address" thing and turn all locks into 0x90 
(nop).
