It's different for a driver that drives real hardware.
struct net_device::set_mac_address() is called inside rtnl_lock().  The 
safe thing to do is
1) read MAC address from eeprom on probe
2) write MAC address to hardware upon each dev->open()
3) use default eth_mac_addr() from net_init.c
And the netif_running() check in eth_mac_addr() is correct, because it 
does not update the hardware MAC address (which in this API would be 
impossible).
Normally the netif_running() check is for hardware that cannot update 
its MAC address safely during operation.
