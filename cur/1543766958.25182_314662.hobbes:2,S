You can do that without an invisible mount:
mkdir /tmp/mnt
mkdir /tmp/dir1
mkdir /tmp/dir1/subdir1
mkdir /tmp/dir2
mkdir /tmp/dir2/subdir2
cd /tmp/mnt
mount --bind /tmp/dir1 .
mount --bind /tmp/dir2 .
Now you have both /tmp/dir1 and /tmp/dir2 rooted at the same dentry.
To test this, in another shell do this just after the first bind mount:
cd /tmp/mnt
Then after the second mount do
ls -l subdir1/..
Now unmount everything and repeat the experiment, but do the mounts
this way:
mount --bind /tmp/dir1 /tmp/mnt
mount --bind /tmp/dir2 /tmp/mnt
Now the second mount is an overmount of the first, and you will
actually get different result from the "ls".
Playing with mounts is fun :)
