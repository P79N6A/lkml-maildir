  Actually the reverse could be much more easily said to be true.  If 
they only supplied the src.rpm,  and not the source rpm more people 
would scream than the reverse.   The number of people who know how to 
produce a custom kernel from a src.rpm is fairly limited.  Keep in mind 
most of UL's customer are not kernel hackers.
   Of course the correct thing to do is simply provide both and make 
people happy.  A determined person can still get what ever they want out 
of either form.  Making it hard just leads to your customers and the 
community hating you.
