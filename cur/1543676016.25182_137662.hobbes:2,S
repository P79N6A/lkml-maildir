I didn't say CONFIG_HOTPLUG, I said hotplug. Basically SCSI in 2.4 will
not let recognize devices that were not present when the scsi-host was
initially registered with the SCSI stack. You have to run
rescan-scsi-bus.sh (or manually send the add/remove commands via
procfs).
Please read the linux-kernel and/or linux1394-devel mailing list
archives. I really hate dredging this all up again.
