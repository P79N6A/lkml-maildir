First, it sounds like you are confusing motherboard "RAID" with real 
RAID.  There's a FAQ for this sort of thing:
	
http://linux-ata.org/faq-sata-raid.html
In particular, your motherboard's Raid 0 striping (a) is not done in 
hardware, and (b) has nothing to do with SATA2.
But anyway, to help answer the question of hardware vs. software RAID, I 
wrote up a page:

Generally, you want software RAID unless your PCI bus (or more rarely, 
your CPU) is getting saturated.  With RAID-0, there is no duplication of 
data, and so, PCI bus and CPU usage should be about the same for 
hardware and software RAID.
