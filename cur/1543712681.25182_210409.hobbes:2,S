Szervusz Erich,
I put AI between quotation marks because it is not a real intelligence.
It should not waste much time on being intelligent :-)
At least we have not managed to find out a general purpose solution that
could cope with no matter what application.
We try to tune parameters, like sampling period / time, how many pages
are checked, when we consider a page as "hot", how many % or # cycles
distant vs. local justifies the migration...
We try to set up a "profile" for an application.
The launcher of the application takes into account the profile and
the AI evaluates the HW counters according this profile info.
I think most of the huge applications of our clients will run several
times with different data but with the data of similar behavior.
The clients will have the ability to tune their application profiles.

You should migrate if it worth the cost of the migration to do
(private malloc()-ed data, stack,...).
Do you mean to guess in the kernel what pages to move ?
I need "real information" :-)) to decide, this is either I ask the HW or
I wait the application to tell me its requirement.

I'd like to know - and someone to try :-)) - how much it costs on another
chip set to measure the page usage statistics, say for 1 Gbytes of memory...
Thanks,
