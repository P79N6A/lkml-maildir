It is pretty poor form to not even bother to Cc the only author of the
code you are modifying, and have no Signed-off-by or Acked-by to even
suggest that it was ever even looked at. This isn't something that ought
to have to be pointed out, either.
In addition to the stuff pointed out by Greg, I don't see what you
actually gain by hacking the OF crap in to this driver. You would be
better off layering the OF driver on top of this, rather than trying to
make them live together in the same file.
See pata_platform/pata_of_platform for an example of how to do this a bit
more sanely.
