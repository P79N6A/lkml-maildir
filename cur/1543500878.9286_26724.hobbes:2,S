I made a number of minor performance changes back in the 2.0.xx days
that may still be applicable:
1) Eliminate the dummy inb instruction when acking interrupts to the
   8259. The comments indicate that these are present to deal with
   some old disk controller problem, and probably a flaky 8259!
2) Change the ethernet drivers to be more parsimonious in their use
   of i/o instructions in their interrupt routines. There are two 
   changes here -- one is not to acknowledge interrupts if there
   are none to be acknowledged. The second is not to check for more
   working arriving while processing the first chunk of work. 
   [This second change should be adaptive.]
The deal is that i/o instructions are *incredibly* expensive on
modern fast processors. A simple inb takes between 500 and 1500 ns
depending on the device (on a 350Mhz PII). My suspicion is that this
is bus limited, so it will be no fast on a 550 PIII. This means that
it is worth spending significant code to avoid I/O (hundreds of
normal instructions).
Why do I bring it up? Essentially these changes can eliminate 3
i/o instructions per interrupt, at around 2 usecs per interrupt.
Will this help -- I don't know, it depends on the actual interrupt
rates in the benchmark above.
For those of you skeptics who doubt me, I attach a simple test 
program that does a bunch of inb/inw/inl to the port of your 
choice, and prints out the speeds. Make sure that you compile
it with -O2, otherwise you get link errors.
