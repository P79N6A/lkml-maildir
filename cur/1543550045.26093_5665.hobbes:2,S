When I was researching the use of ORBS and MAPS a few weeks 
back, my first thought was that the DUL would unfairly block Linux 
users running Sendmail. Looks like that's true.
The DUL's rationale is very suspect.  The logic goes...  Some 
spammers use SMTP from their dial-up PCs to send spam, so we'll 
block their ISP's dial-up address ranges.  Not to worry, because 
legitimate users will relay through their ISP's mail servers.
Hmmmm.   Dodgy.
