thanks, this is very helpful!
Mike, most of the work_on_cpu() patches you did so far were rather 
problematic. Especially something like cpufreq can run rather early during 
bootup or during suspend/resume, so i'm not sure it's correct to rely on 
keventd for it.
I dont see anything particularly wrong in the commit itself - but 
obviously it causes this boot hang - if the bug is not found we'll revert 
it .
Also, this bit in get_cur_val():
+       if (unlikely(!alloc_cpumask_var(&cmd.mask, GFP_KERNEL)))
+               return 0;
how is that supposed to work? If we fail to allocate a cpumask we just 
ignore the call silently? That cannot be right. (but has no connection to 
this boot problem)
