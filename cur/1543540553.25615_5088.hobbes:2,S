That's a _lot_ of flash, and quite a lot of RAM for some applications. I'd 
have said start at 2MB RAM and 1MB flash. You won't be able to run netscape 
in that, but you'd be surprised at what you can manage.
Some boxen don't need much userspace at all - only a single file on the 
filesystem, which contains a dedicated application, is statically linked, 
and is put in place of /sbin/init.
