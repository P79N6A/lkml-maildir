Hi Kumar,

At least drivers/pcmcia/m8xx_pcmcia.c uses the symbol m8xx_pcmcia_ops
which is conditionally defined in platforms/8xx/m8xx_setup.c. However,
this driver currently seems to be broken (doesn't compile neither as
built-in nor as module).
Other drivers that include asm/mpc8xx.c are:
drivers/net/fec.c (the include seems to be obsolete, as according to Kconfig
                    the driver is only built on MPC52xx platforms)
drivers/net/fec_8xx (unused, depends on non-existant CONFIG_8XX)
drivers/net/fs_enet (i need to check if the include is needed, at all)
I'll have a closer look at this.
Thanks,
Jochen
