No, the thing is that the packet driver doesn't create requests at
all. It stuffs incoming bio's in the rbtree, then the worker thread
collects bio's from the rbtree for the same "zone" on the disc (each
zone is 64kb on a CDRW and 32KB on a DVD). The driver then creates a
new bio with the same size as the zone size and submits it to the real
CD/DVD device.
