Hi folks,
the cleanup of my cputime patches is done and now I'm ready for the
first round of bashing ;-)
I've split the kernel patch into 5 parts, Jan works on another kernel
patch that introduces virtual cpu time slices but this isn't ready yet.
Patch number 6 is a patch against procps that make the cpu steal field
visible. Patches number 1 to 3 are kernel code cleanups that make life
easier (I think), number 4 is the one that introduces the cputime
interface to common code and number 5 is s390 architecture code that
makes use of the interface to get exact cputime numbers.
The patches are against 2.6.8-rc3. I'll keep the fingers crossed
that I didn't break any architecture. Have fun.
[PATCH] cputime (1/6): move call to update_process_times.
[PATCH] cputime (2/6): remove unused definitions from timex.h.
[PATCH] cputime (3/6): move jiffies stuff to jiffies.h
[PATCH] cputime (4/6): introduce cputime.
[PATCH] cputime (5/6): microsecond based cputime for s390.
[PATCH] cputime (6/6): add cpu steal time fields to procps.
blue skies,
  Martin.
