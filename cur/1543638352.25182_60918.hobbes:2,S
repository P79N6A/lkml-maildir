Direct email seemed to get seperated from the cc somewhere

Yeah, it's probably unmeasurable, just ugly ;-)
I guess it's more that it seems unnecessary ... if ia64 are the
only people that need it to be that ludicrously large, it'd be
better if they just did it in their arch tree. Just because they
could theoretically have 256Mb pages, do they really *need* them? ;-)

The config_nonlinear stuff relies on a trick ... we shove physically
non-contig areas into the buddy allocator, but the buddy allocator
is guaranteed to return phys contig areas. That all works just fine
as long as the blocks we put in are of size greater than or equal to
2^MAX_ORDER * PAGE_SIZE, which is currently 4Mb. A 4Mb alignment is
not a problem for any known machine, but I think 256Mb may well be.
It's kind of a dirty trick, but it's a really neat, efficient 
solution that gets rid of lots of zone balancing and pgdat proliferation.
It also lets me spread around ZONE_NORMAL across nodes for ia32 NUMA.
