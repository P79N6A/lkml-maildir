It's not strictly necessary to use threads here.  At least not with
gtk+.  I don't know whether other toolkits are the same.
Anyway with gtk+, you can install "idle callbacks".  These are
functions to be called whenever the GUI code has nothing to do.  If
you can transform your html parser(s) into idle function(s), then it
won't necessarily disrupt the GUI.  You just have to make sure that
the parser yields periodically (returns to gtk+).  Since parsers are
loop oriented, this shouldn't be too hard, you just make each call to
the function do 1 iteration of the top level loop.
My traffic generator, mxtraf, works this way.  It has a software
oscilliscope (gscope) that graphically displays signals in real time.
At the same time it does lots of IO work to generate synthetic network
traffic.  mxtraf is single threaded.
