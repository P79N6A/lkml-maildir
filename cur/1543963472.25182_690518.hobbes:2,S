Git master as of 3de2403e allows me to run X again.
After installing the new kernel I also re-compiled all of the X server
stack (libdrm, libpciaccess, mesa, the X server and the video driver).  
I don't know how much of a difference that made.
I don't know whether the problem was sched, x86, agp or dri related,
but AFAICT it is now fixed.
Thanks,
