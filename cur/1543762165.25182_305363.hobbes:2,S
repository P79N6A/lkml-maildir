m68k doesn't clone it. This is from macsonic.c,
#define vdma_alloc(foo, bar) ((u32)foo)

Sure, but until that happens, it would be nice if the upstream kernel had 
the MIPS repo versions of sonic.c, sonic.h and jazzsonic.c. That way it 
might be possible for me to put together a patch for macsonic that both 
archs are happy with.
It doesn't require a new DMA API to fix all the built-in ethernet ports on 
68k Macs.
