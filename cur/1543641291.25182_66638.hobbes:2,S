Andi,
I think it needs to be RFC conformance for PMTU to avoid unnecessary
probing PMTU network traffics. For UDP and ICMP which doesn't have any
reference on this kind of route, the route needs to be around for a while
instead of being delete within a very short time even immediately.
Thanks

This seems overkill and could potentially tie up quite a of dst
entries for dubious purposes. This RFC requirement clearly cannot be
followed in all cases, e.g. when you run out of memory for the
destination cache. This is one such case too.
I think only following it when there is still another reference to the
dst entry (e.g. from a socket) is reasonably near the spirit of the
specification.
