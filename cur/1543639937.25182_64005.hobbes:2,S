That's an extremly expensive operation on some platforms and there's no
portable kernel API to do it.
Note that the flush_cache_*() functions are not suitable for I/O as you
want to do it.  Many platforms such as i386 implement these functions
as empty functions.

You said you intend to remap memory, that is RAM.  The ioremap*() functions
will refuse to remap RAM; they're only suitable for other types of memory
such as PCI boards.  If the latter was your intension then ioremap_nocache()
will work as intended.
Again, unless your hardware is fucked beyond recognition it'll do a better
job at keeping cache coherence than software.
