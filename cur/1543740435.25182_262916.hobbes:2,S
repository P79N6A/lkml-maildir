module_param_array() takes a variable to put the number of elements in. 
Looking through the uses, many people don't care, so they declare a dummy
or share one variable between several parameters.  The latter is
problematic because sysfs uses that number to decide how many to display.
The solution is to change the variable arg to a pointer, and if the pointer
is NULL, use the "max" value.  This change is fairly small, but fixing up
the callers is a lot of (trivial) churn.
