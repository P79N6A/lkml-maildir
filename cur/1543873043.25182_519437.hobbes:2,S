It gets free'd through device_unregister
    for (i = 0; i < num_ports; ++i) {
       ...
       port->dev.release = &port_release;
       ...
       retval = device_register(&port->dev);
which means that until all the drivers get converted to use
->port_probe() and ->port_remove() (which gets called by
device_unregister) and stop using the ->port[] array in ->shutdown()
we need to have ->shutdown() called before device_unregister.

So, this patch should be reverted for now.
