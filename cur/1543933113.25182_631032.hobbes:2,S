I supposed you meant "interested."  Proper coding style doesn't make for 
proper code.  Arguably, it aids when reading code, and that's why we 
mostly stick to agreed standards; but it's hard to get worked up over a 
dot at the end of a log message.  In cases where it really does matter, 
we make sure it's right; but demanding that every message meets some 
unilateral idea of what is right is zealotry.
