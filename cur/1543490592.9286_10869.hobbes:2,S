dump.  the model of consistency.  you missed the s 100000 option.
generally, when dumping...
Linux:   [r]dump 0usf 1000000 [output] [partition]
Solaris: ufsdump 0ubf 1000000 [output] [partition]
Ultrix:  [r]dump 0ousf 1000000 [output] [partition]
OSF/1:   vdump 0usf 1000000 [output] [partition] (incompatible format, advfs,
                                                  not r-dumpable)
         [r]dump 0usf 1000000 [output] [partition] (std format, non-advfs)
Others:  [r]dump 0usf 1000000 [output] [partition]
Under all of the above, you can omit the 's' and 1000000 if you output to
standard output ("-").
Don't you just love consistency?  (oh, linux is separate from "others" above
since it is /sbin/dump not /etc/dump, I missed all the weird and wonderful
locations people choose to put dump from the above list)
rdump is of course a horrible thing, dump|ssh is far better/faster/more likely
to succeed with current ext2 dump (rdump takes longer and hence more often
gets confused by changes to the fs while dumping).
David.
