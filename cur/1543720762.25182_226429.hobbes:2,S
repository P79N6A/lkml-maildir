Sorry about that mistake.  I see now that the data field has a __user
annotation.

I agree that documenting interfaces is good.  Just because the tool can
infer things automatically doesn't mean they can't also be annotated --
it just means you can get results sooner.  I also understand if you just
want to do it the C way.
QUESTION:  Do you find it's difficult to figure out which fields of
structures should be declared __user?  One feature you might find useful
to add to sparse is the following:
If a structure pointer is __user, but it has some pointer fields that
aren't declared __user, there's a good chance that there's a missing
annotation or something.  This is a simplified version of a rule in
cqual, but I think you might be able to implement it purely locally in
sparse.  It'd be a bit of a hack, but it might help you discover missing
annotations sooner.  Without this, the following code passes sparse w/o
error:
struct foo { char __kernel * p; };
void func (struct foo __user * x)
{
  struct foo y;
  copy_from_user(&y, x, sizeof (y));
  y.p[0] = 0;
}
Best,
Rob
