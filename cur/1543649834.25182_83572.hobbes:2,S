There are the couple of wrinkles:
        __asm__ __volatile__ ( " fsave %0; fwait\n"::"m"(fpu_save[0]) );
Wrong. Parameter is output. Remove one ':', replace "m" -> "=m".
        __asm__ __volatile__ (
                " femms\n" : :
        );
What for? frstor will nuke out MMX state anyway.
static void fast_copy_page(void *to, void *from)
has two fsaves and no frstor ;)
"run three times" - can program do that on its own and find minimum?
I modified your test to be able to run it on Celeron.
(#defined out femms, replaced prefetch -> prefetchnta). Results are below.
I think it is impossible to make Best for all CPUs (tm) copy
function, we will newer know... maybe Hammer will do fastest copies
by rep movsb?
Btw, I used Arjan's program too, attaching my version...
Your method is indeed faster (see npf_copy.c).
We should avoid doing the same thing again and again...
There are several block ops in the kernel (memcpys, 
csum_copy routines (see my other post)), can we
coordinate efforts to speed them up too?
FWIW, here's my results (Celeron 1200):
