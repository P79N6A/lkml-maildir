Well in this case things are so very much better then attempting to
us setup.S it isn't a real option.
In general BIOS calls just don't work reliably after linux has
been running for a while.
As for YH's point it does look like there are a few ways
to poke the linux kernel to see what is happening.
We can look in /proc/ioports and see what has reserved
the video resources.  That should give us a reasonable
estimate of the video adapter.  We can do an ioctl to
the console and see how many lines and columns we have.
Reusing boot_params could be nice but if we have the information
available in other ways digging it out that way is quite possibly
better.
