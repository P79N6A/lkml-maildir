I haven't gathered evidence; I rather look for evidence that fork() is
failing, like bash complaints.  I get those in abundance in the first
case; but see none in the second case.
Trying again, I can't reproduce the phenomena.  It crashes out in 3
seconds.  Either just weird that it ran for so long last time before I
had to manually kill it off; or a race.  I don't have sufficient data to
decide.
