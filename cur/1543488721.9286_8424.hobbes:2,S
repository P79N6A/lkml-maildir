I'm replying to my own message. More information. On looking at the EIP
via SysRQ after a lockup, I notice it is in <cleanup_module+b66/1d9c>.
Which is rather strange considering that while I am running kmod, my
modules are pretty much static:
Module                  Size  Used by
softdog                  944   1  (autoclean)
ne                      5984   1  (autoclean)
8390                    6364   0  (autoclean) [ne]
autofs                  8972   1  (autoclean)
binfmt_misc             3436   0 
I do have the standard */10 * * * * rmmod -a in my crontab, which I have
disabled to see if that is involved about 4 hours ago. I've been hitting
the box as hard as I can (network /X wise) but haven't had a hiccup yet.
Now, a little about OOPS tracing when there's no oops (ie, a lockup). What
other information is gleamable from SysRQ (other than EIP) that is useful? 
G'day!
