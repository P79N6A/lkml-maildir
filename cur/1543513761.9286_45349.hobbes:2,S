the very same happens to me. (the same adapter)

I do not need to reinsert modules; just bringing eth0 down and up returns it
to normal

it goes all the time I remember (it was about 2.2.5 since the computer exists),
up to 2.2.12, I haven't tried 2.2.13 yet

I/O mode, no errors or warning, everything seems usual
after 13 days of uptime, I think it did not happened since then
(it is not an important server anymore)
I vaguely remember that when it happened the number of errs went up 
dramatically.

: If there is nothing obviously wrong in that then you may need to use
: tcpdump to get a better look at what is happening during a slowdown.
nothing unusual, just a lot of traffic (i.e. copying files from nfs mount,
while ftp-ing (simultaneously more connections) other files, while
another linux with ipx-overbroadcasting bug was flooding the network :-)
(the latter is not neccessary)
