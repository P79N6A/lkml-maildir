We have changed it already (e.g,. for regparm(1), fewer relocs, shorter insn
sequences, etc.), but with exception of 2 non-dynamic relocs (which get
different numbers) we are still compatible.
But as written later, just using a different GDT descriptor could avoid
having to change the ABI, but would still have the undesirable property of
requiring every app to mmap a new page at fixed location.
