great stuff! I've picked these cleanups up into x86.git. (will pick up 
Jason's commits too)
Could you try something else too perhaps, which would be way useful for 
me: to add a sysctl flag (or something like that) to change kgdboc to 
accept a Ctrl-C and break into kgdb mode? [this means a simple Ctrl-C on 
a kgdboc line would break into KGDB as well - but that would be an 
acceptable price.] Right now kgdboc just hangs when gdb attaches - i 
have to generate a SysRq sequence via a terminal emulator to break it 
into KGDB mode.
This would make kgdboc way more practical without having to resort to a 
protocol splitting proxy, etc.
