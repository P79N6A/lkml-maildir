No, running X at a different priority than its clients is not really
a good idea. If it isn't immediately obvious why try something like
this:
mkdir /tmp/tempdir
cd /tmp/tempdir
for i in `seq -w 1 10000` ; do touch
longfilenamexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx$i
; done
nice --20 xterm &
xterm &
nice -20 xterm &
then do "time ls -l ." in each xterm.
This is what i get on UP 2.6.20+RSDL.31 w/ X at nice 0:
-20: 0m0.244s user   0m0.156s system   0m3.113s elapsed   12.84% CPU
  0: 0m0.216s user   0m0.168s system   0m2.801s elapsed   13.70% CPU
 19: 0m0.188s user   0m0.196s system   0m3.268s elapsed   11.75% CPU
I just made this simple example up and it doesn't show the problem
too well, but you can already see the ~10% performance drop. It's
actually worse in practice, because for some apps the increased
amount of rendering is clearly visible; text areas scroll
line-by-line, content is incrementally redrawn several times etc.
This happens because an X server running at a higher priority than a
client will often get scheduled immediately after some x11 traffic
arrives; when the process priorities are equal usually the client
gets a chance to supply some more data. IOW by renicing the server
you make X almost synchronous.
This isn't specific to RSDL - it happens w/ any cpu scheduler; and
while the effects of less extreme prio differences (ie -5 instead of
-20 etc) may be less visible i also doubt they will help much.
A better approach to X interactivity might be allowing the server to
use (part of) the clients timeslice, but it's not trivial -- you'd
only want to do that when the client is waiting for a reply and you
almost never want to preempt the client just because the server
received some data.
As to RSDL - it seems to work great for desktop use and feels better
than mainline. However top output under 100% load (eg kernel
compilation) looks like below -- the %CPU error seems a bit high...
