portal fs was an experiment.  i'm not saying that there should
not be a filesystem interface: what i've been pointing out is that
there are other, existing, methods that appear to work well.
so, before writing lots more code, i think it would be a good
idea to have requirements and justification that takes into
consideration the existing methods.
could someone summarise the high-level requirements please?
