Per file history is also expensive for another reason. The basic reason is 
that I think that a hash based storage is not the best approach for SCM. 
It's lacking locality, so the more it grows the more it has to seek to 
collect all the data.
To reduce the space usage you could replace the parent file with a sha1 
reference + delta to the new file. This is basically what monotone does 
and might cause perfomance problems if you need to restore old versions 
(e.g. if you want to annotate a file).
bye, Roman
