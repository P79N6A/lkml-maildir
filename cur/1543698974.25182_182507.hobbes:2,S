Naming "1,0,0" won't work everywhere for me.
I started using a 3ware ide card because promise and siig sis
were crashing nforce2, so it's a unified concept ;-) to use
ide-scsi scsi-sg for hd's on 3ware and for cdr cdrw. I can rip from
cdr through pipes to yamaha cdrw, pre-emptive kernel, anticipatory
sched, use dma, devfs. The only quirk is naming "1,0,0" won't work
everywhere--
#/etc/default/cdrecord
CDR_DEVICE=ATAPI:/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/generic
# ATAPI:1,0,0 won't work in CDR_DEVICE but below it does--
yamaha=   ATAPI:1,0,0   -1      -1      ""
#/usr/src/linux/.config--
# ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support
