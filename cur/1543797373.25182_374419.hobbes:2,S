For scalex I think it needs to be page aligned because that is what
the effective cacheline size for remote nodes is in their setup. 
That would be difficult for kmalloc because it cannot guarantee that
alignment nor avoid false sharing. For the BP case it's ok as 
long as the beginning is correctly aligned and the rest 
is read-only.
