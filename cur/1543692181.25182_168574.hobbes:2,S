Hmm, that's indeed interesting and it'd point to a driver problem -
when reading, the drive is dictating the timing, but when writing, it's
the controllers turn.
So if the controller timing is not correctly programmed, reads function,
but writes don't.
Can you send me the output of 'lspci -vvxxx' of the IDE device?
I'll take a look to see if it looks correct.

Well, I've got this feeling that not just IDE interrupts get lost under
heavy IO load with recent kernels ...
