But drivers rarely care about exact IRQ that caused their interrupt
routines to be called. I looked at some of them and they normally use
it just to print warnings which is not critical (and data can still be
retrieved form elsewhere). And without it the only argument can very
nicely be passed via a register (if regparm is allowed).
Drivers that truly need to know IRQ can have it added to dev_id cookie
and use separate dev_ids.
