If it's really enumerated data types, that's fine, but this example was 
about bitfield masks.

defines are not just used for constants and there is _nothing_ wrong with 
using defines for constants.

Nevertheless it's part of the language, it's used all over the kernel and

only worse. I prefer consistency here over any minor advantages enums 
might have.
