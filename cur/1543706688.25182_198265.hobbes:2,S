Generally, enum and inline functions are preferable to the above.
Things to avoid when doing macros:
	1) macros that affect control flow:
#define FOO(x) do {if (blah(x) < 0) return -EBUGGERED;} while(0)
is _not_ a good idea.  It looks like a function call; don't break the internal
parsers of those who will read the code.
	2) macros that depend on having a local variable with magic name:
#define FOO(val) bar(index, val)
might look like a good thing, but it's confusing as hell when one reads the
code and it's prone to breakage from seemingly innocent changes.
	3) macros with arguments that are used as l-values: FOO(x) = y; will
bite you if somebody e.g. turns FOO into inlined function.
