Last I looked, the SCSI interfaces were much nastier than the native 
queueing, and if there is anything missing I'd rather put it at that 
layer, instead of making everything use the SCSI layer.
Because when you talk about error handling messes, you're talking SCSI. 
THAT is messy. At least judging by the fact that a lot of SCSI drivers 
don't seem to get it right.
In other words: I'd really like to see what you can do with a _native_
request queue driver, and what the probloems are. And maybe port _those_ 
parts of SCSI to it.

Well, I don't think it claimed to, until today. Still doesn't work?
