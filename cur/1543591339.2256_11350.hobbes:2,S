For identifying this is probably the right approach. However identifying is 
not enough, as the ioctl discussion has shown. Capabilities are needed. How 
can the device registry provide that information ? If we register it together 
with the device, we might spend a lot of resources needlessly and can't deal 
with devices whose capabilities change dynamically.
In addition how do we export the information ? Proc ? Device nodes (bad for 
network devices) ?
