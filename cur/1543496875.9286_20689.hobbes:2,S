	1. In case of a kernel panic, is a core created ?.
	   Can I debug the core by gdb. ?
	   ( I do a gdb -c on /proc/kcore. I get a message register 
   	   st0 not found.)
	2. In case of remote debugging of a driver, the breakpoints are not
	   getting mapped to the actual function addresses. Also
	   when I map it to the function address ( from /proc/ksyms),
	   there is mismatch between the listed code and the breakpoint.
	   Is there any mistake I am doing?
