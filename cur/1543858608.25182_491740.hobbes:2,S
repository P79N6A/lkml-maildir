No, I'm saying the hddtemp breakage people report against 2.6.20-rc1
also occurred between 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 and 2.6.19-rc6-mm1, as reported in
this bug.
Also this system sports two different (S)ATA controllers (SiI 3114 and
CK804), disks on both stopped reporting temp at the same time so the
change is not chipset-specific
