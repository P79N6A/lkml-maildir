No, I'm representing myself only.  I don't think you represent all
kernel developers when posting from the kernel.org address.
I'm actually surprised that you are raising this issue.  If the
motivation to ban ndiswrapper is based on the copyright law, doesn't it
meant that we have DRM in the kernel now?  Is Linux going to enforce
copyright laws across the world?

Absolutely not.

I, for one, would welcome an informed position of the FSF.  It may have
interesting implications for Wine, ReactOS, mplayer, qemu, Java and many
other programs loading non-free compiled code at the run time.
