The saving to be made by trying to cache the data across a umount of a
floppy, seems trivial compared to the risk involved.  The vast majority of
the time, the next floppy will be different.  (I can see the logic when hard
disk partitions are involved.)
In general I'm against software trying to work around faulty hardware, but
when the hardware can be faulty without anyone knowing about it (in many
cases, this will be because up to now they've been using an OS where the
disk change line is irrelevant), perhaps the user could be cut a little
slack, if the alternative is trashing his floppies.
If I were a company being paid to rig^H^H^Hrun benchmarks for Microsoft,
then this, combined with a "coincidentally" slightly faulty floppy drive,
would be on my list of stuff to bash Linux with.

"We asked in the newsgroups if anyone else was having their floppies
corrupted, but received no reply.  Meanwhile, three Microsoft engineers were
available to corrupt our floppies for us by hand using the finest
ferro-nickel electromagnets.  This on its own raises serious questions about
the Linux community's attitude towards professional floppy-corruption
support"
