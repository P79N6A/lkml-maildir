I assume that /proc/bus/usb/drivers went to driverfs. Everyone likes the new 
guy :)
I'd like the file back. We have a lot of debugging advice that asks people to 
send that particular file to us, and it is very useful. Even if you update 
the few places that you can find, then you will still have a lot of confusion 
(well, if you have 2.4, then send this, and if you have 2.6, send this, and 
if that doesn't exist, and you're on 2.4, mount this filesystem, else mount 
this filesystem). Ugly, and increases the support workload.
A symlink will do, assuming both filesystems are mounted. If we only have 
usbfs, I still want the data.
Please fix this before 2.6.
Brad
