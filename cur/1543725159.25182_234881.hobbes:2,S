I think there are other problems, too:
 - any fork() will reset mm->def_flags to zero so if you exec
   an old binary and it does a fork, future mmaps() won't
   have the execute-bit turned on any more; perhaps a rare problem,
   but it certainly seems an illogical behavior
 - likewise for do_mlockall(): it stomps on def_flags without preserving
   the old bits
Am I missing something?
