  This seems to still use the processor to copy the shadow buffer
 to the video memory, you will still have the PCI write stall...

  I am not speaking of DMA'ing at the refresh frequency (approx 70 times
 per second the complete video memory), just the modified 64Kb blocks,
 "once upon a while": if a single pixel is written twice, you will just
 see the latter written value on the screen - but who cares.
  Been able to DMA the complete video memory image around 5-10 times/second
 should be over the human eye sensitivity.
  Moreover this pixel will stay on the processor memory cache a lot
 longer, even without MTRR processors.
  Etienne.
