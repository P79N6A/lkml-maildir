Subject: wrong mtu value in /proc/net/route

I've found something strange going on in 2.4 kernels - when I run
'netstat -r' I get the routing table from /proc/net/route.   The MSS
value reported is only 40 bytes, and when I run 'cat
/proc/net/route I'm told that the _MTU_ is 40 bytes.   I thought the MSS was
supposed to be the MTU - 40 bytes, not 40 bytes in
total, where the MTU for ethernet is 1500.  If I run ifconfig, it reports the 
correct MTU of 1500 for eth0 and 16463 for lo.   This computer has a NetGear 
FA311 card, and is running 2.4.19-pre7-ac2, though I've also seen this 
happening on a 2.4.18 kernel.
