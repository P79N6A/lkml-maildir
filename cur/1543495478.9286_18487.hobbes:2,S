I'm picking up a machine this afternoon, and it comes with a DVD drive.
My understanding is that there are no drivers for these as of yet.  I will
need to install linux from my RH5.2 CD, so I am going to buy a CD-RW
drive at the same time (I think).
Questions:
1)will the machine be happy under Linux with both devices in place?
  (It will be a quad boot, Linux, NT, Win98, Solaris)
2)are there any experimental/developmental drivers for the DVD?
3)do CD-RW devices work like CD for the purpose I stated above, or should
  I buy a plain CD device?
4)I need to add another disk for all these OSes.  I assume 2 HD's and
  one DVD and one CD are all going to live happily here.  Which devices
  need to be primary?  I assume the HD's need to be if I want to boot from
  them?
thanks,
-chuck
