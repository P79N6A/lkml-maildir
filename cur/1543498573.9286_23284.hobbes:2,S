Hi!
This patch fixes two problems for 2.2.9 on PowerPC. The first bug
prevents the kernel from compiling due to a missing #include
statement.
The second one is related to the UDF driver. The UDF driver includes
linux/fs.h, which in turn includes asm/bitops.h, in order to provide
bit-fiddling functions to the user. This is fine for i386, where ffs()
is defined in asm/bitops.h. On PowerPC, however, ffs() is defined as
generic_ffs(), which in turn is defined in linux/bitops.h. Since
linux/bitops.h includes asm/bitops.h, including linux/bitops.h in
linux/fs.h is the right thing to do.
