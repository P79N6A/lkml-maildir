Hello kernel maillist,
I'm new member maillist.
Currently, I receive the warning log from my kernel.
Since update to
Linux  2.6.14.3 #1 SMP Fri Nov 25 20:20:05 SGT 2005 i686 GNU/Linux from 2.4,
I am getting the warning log:
kernel: KERNEL: assertion (!sk->sk_forward_alloc) failed at
net/core/stream.c (279)
kernel: KERNEL: assertion (!sk->sk_forward_alloc) failed at
net/ipv4/af_inet.c (148)
Any information about this issue, and how to solve this problem ?
Another server that i rolled back from 2.6.14 to 2.4 kernel and has no
warning again. is this bug from 2.6 kernel?
Thanks for your info.
YB
