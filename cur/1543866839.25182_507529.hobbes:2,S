I have seen at least three *thousand* boxes configured that way in the last
five years.  From at least a hundred different vendors (almost all of them
small "system assembler" vendors that mix generic and customer-specified
parts).
For some stupid reason, it appears that the norm around here (Brazil) is
that "no brand" boxes get assembled with ATAPI devices in slave mode.
Usually they attach it to the second channel using an 40-wire cable, even if
there is nothing using the first channel.
There is an amazing ammount of hardware out there which needs PATA drivers
to deal as gracefully as possible on a ATAPI PATA device alone as slave on a
channel, and I'd say at that point it is best to just deal with ATA PATA
devices in that configuration, too.
