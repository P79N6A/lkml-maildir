I have this randomly happening as well, it's happened as I set a long
download, go to bed then wake up and find ftp frose (without timming out)
along with everything else :/
I don't think it's script kiddies though because when I'm on irc, the
server tells everyone I have an address that resolves to 127.0.0.1.
(staff.starchat.net) :P
Last kernel that had this prob was 2.2.0-pre6.
I would be happy to try anything to help track it though (just tell me
how)

As a computer I find your faith in technology amusing.
