Compound pages will fix all that up.  You take a ref on any of the subpages
and that will pin the entire higher-order page.

hrm.  I'd have thought that such a restriction would be unnecessary if we
get the page refcounting done right.  With, say, compound pages!
Maybe the restriction is there for other reasons.

Compound pages are just a way of handling refcounting of a higher-order
page.  Nothing to do with TLBs at all.
