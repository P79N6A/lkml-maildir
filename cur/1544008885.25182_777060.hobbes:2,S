It's the way the file systems do it. If you don't believe me feel
free to read the code for yourself.

Remember this is done by a commit thread in a journaling file system. 
Commits are ordered so the thread cannot really order out of order 
anyways. And yes the barriers are essentially a way to flush the cache
regularly for selected commits. The alternative (if you
want to guarantee transaction order) would be to disable
the write cache completely and do it synchronous on each IO.

From the high level journaling perspective they are not asynchronous
I think. Just the low level xfs_buf interface happens to use the asynchronous
callbacks instead of calling into the block layer directly like jbd et.al.
do.
