Helo guys...
I'm new here...
And I'm happy for this
We need some help, and maybe we are looking in the wrong place...
We are compiling the 2.6.14 Kernel for a HP Proliant DL380 G4 that has a
Smart Array 6i Controller.
We would like to know wich Kernel modules we need to add to have support for
this controller.
Another question: In the Slackware Distro that we have been installed, the
system recognizes just 882Mb of Memory (The system has 2Gb)
Will compiling Kernel 2.6.14 with this RAID support and Highmem Module
enabled solve these problems??
Thanks for all.
PS: sorry my bad english... i need to learn more....uhauauh
