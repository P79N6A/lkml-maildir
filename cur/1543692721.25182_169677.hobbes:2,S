   Already done. Look for DRI/DRM/framebuffer.

   That's not a kernel stuff - but it is already done - google around 
for microwindows nanogui - you will find links for light-weight GUIs.
   Bringing this into kernel space will make it only slower. On 
performance critical pathes people avoid simple calls - and you want to 
bring here system call...

   Already in place for last two decades - poll()/select().
