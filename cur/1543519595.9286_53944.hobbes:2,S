Hi,
IMHO, 2.0.36 handles my (possibly wacky) CD-ROM drive better than does
2.2.12/13.
After my initial inquiry <vi9g0xazqw3.fsf@ganglot.ifi.uio.no> last
Friday, I've done a few tests on kernel 2.0.36 as shipped from Red Hat
as an upgrade to Red Hat Linux 5.2, i.e. kernel-2.0.36-3.
As described in that message, 2.2.12 hangs indefinitely in a kernel
routine, repeatedly issuing "hdc: lost interrupt" when I initiate CD
ripping or mounting after audio-CD playback.
2.0.36 seems to have some problems too, but after a few seconds it
issues a message to log and proceeds with its destined operation.
These few seconds of "hang" seem very similar to the indefinite hang
of 2.2.12.
The message from 2.0.36 reads:
| kernel: hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58
| kernel: hdc: ATAPI reset complete
| kernel: hdc: media changed
When alternating between audio-CD playback and ripping, the following
line is also issued one or several times, although the tray has not
been opened.
| kernel: hdc : tray open or drive not ready
This messages is otherwise seemingly harmless (operation proceeds and
succeeds), but may be an extra clue for what I know.
Hope this information has been useful.
I haven't tried any of the "Linux CD-ROM Patches" on
<
http://www.kernel.dk/>.
 Are there any that might work for me?
Cheers,
Knut Aksel Røysland
