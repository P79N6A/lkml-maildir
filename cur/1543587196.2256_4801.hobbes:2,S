That approach is fine, although I'd personally prefer to take the
exception just once and just rewrite the instuction as a "call". The
places that need xadd would have to follow some strict guidelines (long
modrms or other instructions to pad out to enough size, and have the
arguments in fixed registers)

Ehh. I find that the slower the machine is, the more easily I _notice_
that it is slow. So..
