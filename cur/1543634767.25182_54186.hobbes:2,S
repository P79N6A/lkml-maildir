Back in the 1970s I used a computer where disk drives, tape drives and RAM 
chould be physically connected to and used by more than one computer at once.
It was an IBM S/370 model 168 MP; you might argue the toss on the RAM, but the 
disk drives were beyond argument.
On which devices should MVS have ignored power cycling?
