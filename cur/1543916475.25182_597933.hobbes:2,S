I'd start with modifying the existing FAT driver.  Once you have working
code you can look at the amount of changes and decided if you want to
add support to the existing driver or fork it.  If you think you can't
just judge it by yourself send your prototype to lkml or -fsdevel for
an rfc so we can look over it and guide you a little on how to do it.
