If you know the use count is already one there isnt one, jut use
MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and flame Rusty
If you can't prove the use count is already one for your own module
you have a problem (and did in 2.4 in truth). The layers try and 
lock the layer below. So char drivers are locked by core code,
block drivers likewise, tty drivers and so on...
Most driver layers now have an owner: field in the file ops or other
structure they register
	owner: THIS_MODULE,
(THIS_MODULE comes out currently in a non modular buils too)
