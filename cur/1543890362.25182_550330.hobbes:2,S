Sure, this could be the reason in some or all cases.
The upstream author knows the code best, and discussing such issues with 
him will in many cases be a win:
It could be that there was in some cases no good reason, and the 
upstream code that gets used by many other projects could become faster.
Or there was a good reason that applies also to the in-kernel version 
and a change breaks some corner case.

"remove unnecessary ifdefs" implies "generated code is identical".
That's quite different from "code is 10% faster".
