Hello James,
             My understanding is that the scsi_device in SDEV_DEL state
is there in the scsi_host->devices/scsi_target->devices queue, just
because there is some outstanding command holding a reference to it.
It will need the device when it completes. Apart from this, for all 
practical purposes the scsi_device is gone from the system. It could
as well be removed from scsi_host->devices/scsi_target->devices lists
and be put in some other list, just to hold the scsi_device till
commands refering to it are completed. 
The scanning code should not consider these devices to be present 
in the system. This is correctly handled today, as 
scsi_device_lookup/scsi_device_lookup_by_target return NULL if there
is an SDEV_DEL device in the list. 
Since a scsi_device in SDEV_DEL state is "gone" from the system we 
should not hold any fresh references on to this device. The current
scsi_device_lookup/scsi_device_lookup_by_target implementation rightly
ensures that. And since all the sysfs linkages are also removed (in
__scsi_remove_device->device_del), user space can also not reference 
this device. All is good till now.
The problem happens when we try to add a new scsi_device with the same 
HBTL. Since we consider the device "gone" (as described above) we should
allow a new scsi_device with the same HBTL to be added (to the 
scsi_host->devices/scsi_target->devices list). This part is also correctly
implemented.
scsi_add_device->...->scsi_probe_and_add_lun->scsi_device_lookup_by_target
will _not_ return the device present in the SDEV_DEL state and hence the
scanning will go ahead and try to add a new scsi_device (this one in 
SDEV_RUNNING state) to the devices lists.
All is good even till now.
The PROBLEM is, now any scsi_device_lookup call trying to lookup this newly
added scsi_device, fails. This is because, scsi_device_lookup->__scsi_device_lookup
returns the first device that it finds in the list, which in this case
is the one in the SDEV_DEL state. Now the scsi_device_get call that 
scsi_device_lookup makes to get a reference on that device returns ENXIO
as the device is in SDEV_DEL state, resulting in scsi_device_lookup to 
return NULL.
What scsi_device_get does, is right, as we do not want to hold fresh 
references on scsi_devices in SDEV_DEL state. The problem is because
of this we fail to lookup the perfectly legitimate device (in SDEV_RUNNING
state) with the same HBTL sitting in the list.
One of the side effects of this is that the scsi_probe_and_add_lun()
goes ahead with the scanning and tries to add this existent device. 
This is the real problem.
My patch avoids this problem by not breaking from the __scsi_device_lookup
loop, if the device is in SDEV_DEL state. After all we should not consider
these devices to be part of the system. This will allow us to 
find the right scsi_device and this "trying to add an existent device"
problem will be avoided. 
And also why should scsi_device_lookup and __scsi_device_lookup be 
different in behaviour. One returns devices in SDEV_DEL state, the other
doesn't. The comments suggest that they can be used interchangibly, but
for the locking and the extra reference that the scsi_device_lookup holds.
This is fixed as a side effect of the patch.
Comments welcome.
Thanx,
Tomar
