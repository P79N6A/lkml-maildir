...it should be very easy to opensource simple 'something' layer. If
it is so complex it is 'hard' to opensource, it is missdesigned,
anyway... so fix the design.
My proposal would be: add open-source hypervisor interface, and keep
it updated for a while. If it is too hard to keep updated, we'll have
to solve it, somehow, but lets not overengineer it now.
