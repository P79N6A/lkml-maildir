If we've got time before 2.6.24 final, I'd wait on this a bit.
ib_srp:srp_remove_work() has them reversed as well, and I'm currently
tracking down why it oopses when the srp_remove_host() happens before
the scsi_remove_host(), which is the documented call sequence.
This "fixes" the oops I see on unload, but I'm sure it is a correct fix.
