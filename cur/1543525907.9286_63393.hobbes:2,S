	So let me see play with something here (and add the concept
of a ``Features'' inode, so that we don't have to eat up
any more space in the superblock):
/dev/hda1 (ext4fs)
	Superblock:			Pointer to ``features'' inode
	Features Inode:
						Pointer to Capabilities Inode
						Pointer to ACL Inode
						Pointer to Data Log
						Pointer to Metadata Log
						...
	Capability List:	(id,capability,usage_count) tuples
	Arbitrary Inode:	inode->i_capability = pointer to capability id
	So when I mount /dev/hda1, /proc/sys/caps/summary contains
the UNION of all the filesystems' capabilities, right? The kernel
could get this information directly from the Capability List inode.
$ cat /proc/sys/caps/03:01
id	capability	usage
1	0x002F		454
2	0x00FF		67
...
$ cat /proc/sys/caps/summary
device	id	capability	usage
03:01	1	0x002F		454
03:01	2	0x00FF		67
...
08:03	1	0x00F2		36
08:03	4	0xFF00		76
..
	And also, I would see under /proc/{[0-9]*,self}/caps the 
_current_ capability mask for a process? Right?
	Now, if I were to change the capability id for an inode:
$ chcap --capability=2 /etc/passwd
	Then, it would be reflected in the Capability list inode on /dev/hda1.
(which would be preserved on umount)
	Sounds like an excellent approach.
