Hi,
The network block device userland code is on sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nbd/
There isn't much documentation, but feel free to send questions in my
direction. I don't know the answers to your iscsi query though but I'd
be interested to know what the current state of development is as well,
Steve.
