I've also tried 10+ instances of each of the following:
forkload:
#!/bin/sh
./forkload&
execload:
#!/bin/sh
exec ./execload
And it's quite well-behaved in both cases.
Also, if I run:
for a in 1 2 3 4 5; do mkdir $a; cp .config $a; make O=$a & done
..I get mostly good behavior with some occassional snags. Things run
much better than make -j 5. Unfortunately, that doesn't make my kernel
get built faster.
