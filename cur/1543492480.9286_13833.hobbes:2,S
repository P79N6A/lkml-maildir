I don't have an SMP box yet, but I'm working on a real-time signal
processing application that is eventually going to need the ability to
hard assign processes to specified CPUs. I see this an an SMP extension
of the POSIX real-time scheduling functionality - the ability to
override any intelligence/algorithms in the scheduler, and statically
decide an appropriate set of priorities and CPU assignments.
