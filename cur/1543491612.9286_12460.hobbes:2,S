Yes so far

Not necessarily.  Standard Unix raw IO just faults the pages in and then
reads or writes from the physical pages, and it does so automatically on
a normal read() or write() system call.  Zero copy IO does not require
any fancy new API.  We can already do this on Linux with a little work
(ftp.uk.linux.org:/pub/linux/sct/fs/raw*).
