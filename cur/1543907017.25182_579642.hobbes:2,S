Matt, this patch set replaces the two patches I sent earlier and
contains additional fixes.  I've done some reasonably rigorous testing
on x86_64, but not on a 32 bit arch.  I'm pretty sure this isn't worse
than what's in mm right now, which has some user-space corruption and
a nasty infinite kernel loop. YMMV.
Patch set is against 2.6.23-rc1-mm2.
