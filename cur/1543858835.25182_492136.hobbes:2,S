Ok, since it is the second time it happened I decided to report it.
Last week I lost some files in my home directory (at least .gnome
.firefox .bashrc .Xauthority), I think it was after a suspend.
Yesterday exactly the same thing happened (same kernel 2.6.19-rc6-mm2,
I haven't upgraded because I feared data loss on ext3 with newer
kernel as some of them were reported).
I'm using the ata_piix driver (from dmesg):
ata1: PATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0x1F0 ctl 0x3F6 bmdma 0x1810 irq 14
ata2: PATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0x170 ctl 0x376 bmdma 0x1818 irq 15
scsi0 : ata_piix
ata1.00: ATA-6, max UDMA/100, 117210240 sectors: LBA
ata1.00: ata1: dev 0 multi count 16
ata1.00: configured for UDMA/100
scsi1 : ata_piix
ata2: port disabled. ignoring.
scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access     ATA      TOSHIBA MK6026GA PA20 PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
