Depends.

	#include <stdio.h>
	int main(void) {
	    _Bool x = 0;
	    x += 2;
	    printf("%d\n", x);

It can't "overflow". If that's good or not I can't tell, and I can only 
imagine an artifical scenario where it affects things:
	void do_something_wrong(int *x) {
		*x += 2;
	}
	int x = 0;
	do_something_wrong(&x);
	if(x & 1)
		printf("x & 1");
From this one, we would expect nothing to be printed. But if x was a _Bool 
x (and _Bool *x, respectively), something would be printed.
