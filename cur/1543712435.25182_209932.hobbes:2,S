The "boot process" comes up with unlimited access to everything and the
virt2phys direct mapped. As it forks procesess it can arbitrarily restrict
their vision, transitively, and set the translation tables any way it wants.
What I've sketched is one model, where a particular virtual space is used to
map physical and the kernel is broken up into distinct address spaces with
protection boundaries between, and each driver and app in ots own space. But
you could emulate a conventoional, with the kernel and the drivers all in
one space (and mutually vulnerable), or others.

How badly would the average driver break if it did not have direct data
access to kernal data structures? Calls into the kernel and direct access by
the called functions are OK.
