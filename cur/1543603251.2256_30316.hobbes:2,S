Ok, so fix that. (assuming that's not "waiting on the hardware" queued IO)

Oh, *grin*, forgot about those evil framebuffer consoles. (never use them
myself, they really are freakin' slow.)  Arguablly, all access to fbdev's
should be from a process context (it's like having X in the kernel.)
In that case, keventd needs to be a high priority real-time task.  If it
takes SECONDS to change consoles, I'm very likely to assume the machine is
locked and push the reset button (and I'm sure many others will do the same.)
