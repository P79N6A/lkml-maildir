If the count of values handled in a transaction is not to high and it
makes sense to group these values logically, why not just create an
attribute group for every transaction, which creates dummy attributes
to fill the values in, and use an "action" file in that group, that
commits all the values at once to whatever target? That should fit into
the ioctl use pattern, right?
