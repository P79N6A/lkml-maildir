Ah yes ...
Apparently, Rusty, you are unfamiliar with the style of coding that
involves "put in an ugly hack now, commenting the known open issues,
and then clean up the mess some other day".
This is good ... good that you are unfamiliar with such.
Rather than try to convert you to my corrupt ways, which would be
a great loss to the Linux community, and probably not possible anyway,
I will:
 1) Apologize - yes - I should have tried to ask these questions now
    and get this code right (which it turns out is happening anyway).
 2) Send another patch to Andrew, with PAGE_SIZE as he recommends,
    and with the stale struct node cpumap field nuked, as you
    recommend.
Thank-you.  It's a pleasure.
