I agree.  Actually the isapnp specifications (see Figure 2. Plug and Play ISA 
Configuration Flow for Plug and Play BIOS located in Plug and Play ISA
Specification Version 1.0a) recommend that the operating system configures
and activates all devices before drivers are loaded.  For the most part
linux plug and play follows this standard with the exception of manual
configuration support which is included in my latest patches.
