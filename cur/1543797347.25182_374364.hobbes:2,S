If it wasn't OK, I'd expect platform_device_alloc and
platform_device_register to fail when no matching driver is found.
Since they do not, I'd guess it is considered OK not to have a matching
driver. But that's really only a guess and not a replacement for
Russell's (or Greg's) authoritative answer.
Reciprocally, if it is finally decided that it is *not* OK to have a
platform device without a driver, they we want to make both functions
mentioned above fail when no match is found.
I am interested in the answer myself, as I am just realizing that my
own driver registers a platform driver but doesn't use it at all, just
like Dmitry described for his input drivers - so if I am allowed not to
register this platform driver I may just drop that part.
Thanks,
