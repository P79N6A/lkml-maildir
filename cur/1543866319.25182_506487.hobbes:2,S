That is because by default atkbd uses software-emulated raw mode.
bootk with atkbd.softraw=0 or switch it off after boot through sysfs
attribute to get EV_MSC/MSC_RAW passed through).

No, input core should not pass any events device did not claim to support.
What are you trying to do though? Why are you interested in raw atkbd
events? What will your handler do with events from other input devices
that might emit raw events?
