    I have set this oldish BIOS to "auto".
For Linux-only disks, "normal" is best. Then no translations
are done, and the largest number of kernels handles the thing.
(And moreover, no tiny fraction is lost by rounding.)
    These are CHS values reported
    by default, using kernel 2.2.9 and hdparm 3.5:
hdparm 3.5 prints nonsense for LBA CHS.
Use an older version of hdparm or ignore this part of the output.
    hdparm -I (raw)
    LBA CHS            1023/256/63
    hdparm -i (cooked)
    LBA CHS             513/510/63
    The drives work fine when forced to 16383,16,63.
Yes, that is probably what you would have gotten from "normal".
This is best for Linux-only.
If you also have DOS or so, then 1024/255/63 is probably best.
