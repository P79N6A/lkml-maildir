Sorry, you're right.  I was a little confused because I had a memory of
Michael's original email (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/6/150
) quoting a
changelog entry, but looking back at the message, it was quoting
something completely different and misleading.
I think the most interesting email in the old thread is
http://openib.org/pipermail/openib-general/2005-October/012482.html
which shows that reverting 314324121 (the "stretch ACK performance
killer" fix) gives ~400 Mbit/sec in extra IPoIB performance.
