I'm not sure, but this sounds a bit similar to a problem I am seeing. Are 
you by any chance using the CFQ scheduler?! (elevator=cfq) If so, give 
elevator=as or elevator=deadline a go.
The problem I'm seeing is that processes that allocate large amounts of 
memory, are OOM killed or cause swap storms.
