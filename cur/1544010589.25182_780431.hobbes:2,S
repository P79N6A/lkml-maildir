Hi!
The intention is for via_drm.h to be self-containing when included both 
for a kernel build and for a user-space build. In this particular case, 
via_drmclient.h lives in the user-space clients and includes stdint.h to 
get access to uint32_t and friends.
Of course, the user-space clients could
#include "uint32.h"
#include "via_drm.h"
but shouldn't really the tools be mimicing what the compiler does in 
this case?
