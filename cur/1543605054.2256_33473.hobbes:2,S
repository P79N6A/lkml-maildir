This is a different approach to the situation.  Most of the
time in the early 2.4 kernels we were much too busy to stop
machines from crashing to care about performance.
Only in more recent -ac kernels have I actually had time to
look at performance and it seems to be relatively easy to
get the VM to perform better.
Andrea seems to have optimised his VM for performance under
low to medium loads from the beginning ... but in Linux 2.2
we've seen how impossible it is to tune such a simplistic
VM to not fall apart under very high loads, so I won't be
going that way ;)
regards,
Rik
