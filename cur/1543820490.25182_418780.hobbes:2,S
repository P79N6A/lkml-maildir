Hello,
I'm trying to get swsusp working on my DTK FortisPro TOP-5A notebook. I 
compiled 2.6.16 kernel with drivers compiled in (ES1869 sound, TI 
CardBus, Xircom PCMCIA ethernet, Orinoco wifi and maybe something more). 
There is no ACPI as BIOS does not support it. The problem is that when I 
do "echo disk >/sys/power/state", it refuses to suspend:
Stopping tasks: =============================|
Shrinking memory... done (8698 pages freed)
pnp: Device 00:19 disabled.
pnp: Failed to disable device 00:16.
Could not suspend device 00:16: error -5
pnp: Device 00:19 activated.
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 0000:00:01.2
PCI: Found IRQ 9 for device 0000:00:0e.0
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 0000:00:0e.1
eth0: autonegotiation failed; using 10mbs
eth0: MII selected
eth0: media 10BaseT, silicon revision 4
Some devices failed to suspend
Restarting tasks... done
Device 00:19 is gameport of the sound card (it seems to suspend fine), 
however device 00:16 does not. It seems to be the synaptics touchpad:
$ cat /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00\:16/id
PNP0f13
$ cat /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00\:16/resources
state = active
irq 12
The psmouse driver is compiled in. Any ideas?
