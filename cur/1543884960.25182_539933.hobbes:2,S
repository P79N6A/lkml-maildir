I was actually referring to an example where two clients need to have a 
buffer mapped and access it at exactly the same time.
If there is such a situation, we have no other choice than to drop the 
buffer locking on map. If there isn't we can at least consider other 
alternatives that resolve the deadlock issue but that also will help 
clients synchronize and keep data coherent.
