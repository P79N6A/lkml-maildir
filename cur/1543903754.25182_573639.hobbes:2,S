Well, I'm more concerned about testing that change libbfd is rather core
code and used in a number of places. Also, libbfd's current code 'just
works' for every other filesystem concerned, or I'd expect it would have
been changed to mmap() before. I'm also terrified of binutils code :)
I'm also not sure who I'm 'helping', exactly by changing it, beyond
users of libhugetlbfs and OProfile, who are equally helped by this
kernel patch (which, again, also has the added benefit of making
hugetlbfs appear to be more like a normal filesystem).

Fair enough. I'm looking into it, but I can't make any promises on
timelines.
Thanks,
