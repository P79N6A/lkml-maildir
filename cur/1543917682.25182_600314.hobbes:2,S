I'm not very happy with this.
"CodingStyle" should be about the big issues, not about details. Yes, 
we've messed that up over the years, but let's not continue that.
In other words, I'd suggest *removing* lines from CodingStyle, not adding 
them. The file has already gone from a "good general principles" to "lots 
of stupid details". Let's not make it worse.
