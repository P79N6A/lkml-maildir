The Linux FreeS/WAN IPsec implementation has been using IPPROTO_ESP, 
IPPROTO_AH, IPPROTO_INT (61, put aside by IANA for internal use),
IPPROTO_COMP (108), IPPROTO_IPIP (4) for the last 5 years, based on
common usage and examples such as IPPROTO_UDP, IPPROTO_TCP, IPPROTO_ICMP.

We use these in the kernel, but not in userspace.  We define SA_ESP,
etc...

We use the two forms since shared user/kernel headers are a nuisance...
