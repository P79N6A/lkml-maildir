I suppose you load the sonypi driver with the 'fnkeyinit=1' parameter,
right ? In this case, the sonypi mode will enable the ACPI mode
which seems to do the trick for you.
Getting the latest BIOS update from Sony (could be labeled as a
windows XP bios update or something like this) and the latest ACPI
patch from 
http://acpi.sourceforge.net
 will almost certainly
help, as other people pointed out.
Once you make your laptop work correctly from a kernel / bios
point of view, you might want to contact me in private to see
if we can get the sonypi driver to work for you.
Stelian.
