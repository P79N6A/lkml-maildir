We noticed something on a 2.4.17 machine here yesterday.. might not be
related.. but both sync and umount of a loop-mounted ext2 filesystem
caused the umount/sync process to hang in the D-state. The loop0 kernel
thread hung in the same state. And this was 100% reproducible, on THAT
box at least with that ext2 filesystem-image.
