Ah, this is probably it, this is pretty close to the latency I get when
/proc/latency_trace is updated, and this is also the one latency that
doesn't show in the traces by design.
rlrevell@mindpipe:~$ ./amlat-rlr/amlat 
599.895 MHz
secondsPerTick=0.000000
ticksPerSecond=599894954.372806
599.895 MHz
Using rtc interval of 1024
u=0
latency = 53 microseconds
latency = 60 microseconds
latency = 60 microseconds
latency = 62 microseconds
latency = 66 microseconds
latency = 76 microseconds
latency = 78 microseconds
latency = 2548 microseconds
The last line is the latency trace being updated.  If I turn off tracing
or set preempt_max_latency to a high value then amlat doesn't show
these.
