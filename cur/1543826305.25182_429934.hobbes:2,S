I still disagree with the update_wall_time() changes, they should be kept 
the new separate from this. The error algorithm is a somewhat old version 
and can cause oscillation and thus a confused clock.

This is broken, as it simply throws away resolution depending on the 
clock.
These are two key problems, the rest can be fixed incrementally.
