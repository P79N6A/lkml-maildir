eh?   It's going to overflow an unsigned long on x86 too:
typedef struct {
	raw_spinlock_t raw_lock;
#if defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT) && defined(CONFIG_SMP)
	unsigned int break_lock;
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
	unsigned int magic, owner_cpu;
	void *owner;
#endif
} spinlock_t;
I think we need a union here.

The above assumes that page.private is the final field in struct page. 
That's fragile.

I'll make it >= 2 for -mm.
