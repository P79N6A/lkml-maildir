Hello,
I've noticed that with 2.2.1 (or perhaps even earlier) my SCSI bus 
(Adaptect 2940UW, 2 HD's , 2 CDROM's)  is reset at random (perhaps
once every few hours of uptime).  I was wondering if anybody else has
noticed similar behaviour and/or if a fix is in the works....
If this is relevant I'll try to dig up more detailed info for whoever
may be interested...
Also,  what happened to the kernel CVS repository on vger?  Despite
it's faults using the CVS repository was a nice way to keep a local
source tree up-to-date.
