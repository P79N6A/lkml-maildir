Mmm. the problem is that either they're:
1. free text, in which case they're useless, as everyone types
mis-spelled random crud into them. However, free-text search
through the comment fields might work out.
2. Drop downs, in which case someone has to manage the lists
etc, they're horribly crowded with lots of options. trying to
do that for model/BIOS version/chipset would be a nightmare.
If they're mandatory, they're a pain in the butt, and often
irrelevant ... if they're optional, nobody will fill them in.
Either way, they clutter the interface ;-(
Sorry to be a wet blanket, but I've seen those sort of things
before, and they just don't seem to work, especially in the
environment we're in with such a massive diversity of hardware.
If we can come up with some very clear, tightly constrained
choices, that's a decent possibility. Nothing other than
kernel architecture (i386 / x86_64 / ia64) or whatever springs
to mind, but perhaps I'm being unimaginative.
Nothing complicated ever seems to work ... even the simple
stuff is difficult ;-(
