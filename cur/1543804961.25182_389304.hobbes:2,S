Thanks for your detailed response, it rather felt like a fresh breeze.
Really, I was more thinking about a step by step rather than an all or none 
approach.  Something that would involve tmpfs merged with swap mapped into 
linear address space limited by arch bits, and everything else connected as 
archive.
The idea here is to run inside swap instead of using it as an addon.
In effect running inside memory cached by physical RAM.
Wouldn't something like this at least represent a simple starting point?
Thanks!
