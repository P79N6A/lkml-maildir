well, it *sort of* does.  at line 64 of that file:
/*
 * We have up to 8 empty zeroed pages so we can map one of the right colour
 * when needed.  This is necessary only on R4000 / R4400 SC and MC versions
 * where we have to avoid VCED / VECI exceptions for good performance at
 * any price.  Since page is never written to after the initialization we
 * don't have to care about aliases on other CPUs.
 */
although it's not clear where in the source tree are the invocations
that would actually make a difference to a MIPS system, which is why
i've CC'ed ralf on this.  i'm sure he can clear this up. :-)
