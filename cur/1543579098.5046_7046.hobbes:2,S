You missed the context.  I was referring to the 2.2.5? patch that allowed
you to do exactly that - specify a kernel parameter "root=UUID:foo" or
"root=LABEL:bar".  I've re-worked it and will post after testing a bit.
My only hesitation was that kernel probing is frowned upon.  When UUID/LABEL
support for devfs came up at the Miami Linux Storage Workshop, it was
given the thumbs down.
If I get a chance I will also fix LILO to allow UUID/LABEL for root as well.
Cheers, Andreas
