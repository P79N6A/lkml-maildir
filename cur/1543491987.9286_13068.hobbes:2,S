I believe it's in Japanese.  I unfortunately have to use Win98 at work and
it asked if I wanted to download the appropriate font when I opened one.
Sure enough, it looked like Japanese to me...  They were sent to linux-users
or somesuch though, not the linux-kernel mailing list, so I don't know why
we received them...
