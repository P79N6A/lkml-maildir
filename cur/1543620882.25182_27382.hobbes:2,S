Indeed.  A 2 cycle latency on a 4-issue processor means you have
to have quite a large block of code in order for the hot load to
be "free".
On another topic, I'm considering having $8 continue to be current
and using the two-insn stack mask to get current_thread_info and
measuring the size difference that makes.
