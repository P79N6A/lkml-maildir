No it is not. 
1) this code is messy to begin with
2) we accepted the change as is

And you are not able to ******look******* over the brim of your tea
cup and accept that one of them is 64 bit and the others are a tribute
to the not yet distangled shit. There would have been a cleaner and
better way to solve this, but there is always a better and cleaner way
to do things.
Why dont you send a cleanup patch which fixes the three copies problem
instead of spending your time with writing up ivory tower pieces of
wisdom ?
Thanks,
