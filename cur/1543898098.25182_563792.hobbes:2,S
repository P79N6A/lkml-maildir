Oh yes, the dirty handling is tricky. I had to fix a really nasty bug
with it lately. As for page_mkclean_one the difference is that it
doesn't claim a page is dirty if only the write protect bit has not been
set. If we manage to lose dirty bits from ptes and have to rely on the
write protect bit to take over the job, then we have a different problem
altogether, no ?

Ok, thanks for the review. I take a look at frv to see if I missed
something.

That it true, my only concern had been performance. You likely have a
point here.

Hmm, ok, so you are saying that we should do a flush at the end of each
vma.

Would it be acceptable to call tlb_flush_mmu instead of the
tlb_finish_mmu / tlb_gather_mmu pair if the condition around
cond_resched evaluates to false?
The background for this change is that I'm working on another patch that
will change the tlb flushing for s390 quite a bit. We won't have
anything to flush with tlb_finish_mmu because we will either flush all
tlbs with tlb_gather_mmu or each pte seperatly. The pages will always be
freed immediatly. If we are forced to restart the tlb gather then we'll
do multiple flush_tlb_mm because the information that we already flushed
everything is lost with tlb_finish_mmu.
