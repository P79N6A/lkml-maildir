Those are limited to the parport_ip32_dump_state() function.  The
rationale is that this function is only here for debugging purpose,
and I did not want to make it longer than it already is. 
I will correct the style.

The "volatile" is here for type consistency.  Both variables
"mace->perif.ctrl.parport.context_a" and "context_b" (defined in
include/asm-mips/ip32/mace.h) are from type "volatile u64".  Omitting
the "volatile" qualifier for "ctxreg" would make gcc and sparse
complain.
I will add a comment to explain it in the code.

readsb() and writesb() are like ioread8_rep() and iowrite8_rep().  The
io{read,write} family functions are however not available in the
linux-mips.org tree.
The usage of readsb() here is similar to that of insb() in the
corresponding code of the parport_pc driver.

I did not realized that.  I will try to correct the problem.
Thank you for your attention.
