This is one of those "somebody else's .config".

Perhaps.  Although I meant only options which one enables oneself, not
options which are taken over from somebody else's .config.

It surely is unintuitive, and it is one of the worse cases where the
current menu layout is unintuitive.  We have to improve that, even
though it is ultimately impossible to serve everyone's needs equally
well or, generally, make kernel configuration a piece of cake.
Note though, some suggestions which came up here don't actually make the
menus more intuitive.  Notably the patch "Select BLK_DEV_SD for all
SCSI/libata drivers" is counterintuitive in a different color:  It
follows the philosophy of "I know what's good for you and I act on your
behalf behind your back --- trust me, it's for your best".
I too am guilty of proposing the usage of 'select'
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/8/9
) but I suggested a variant which lets
the user stay informed and in control (as far as this is possible with
'select' which always increases complexity, never reduces it).
But rather than adding multiple menu items which enable the same option,
a reorganization of the menus which better reflect the role of SCSI core
and SCSI highlevel might be more effective --- similar to "Networking"
which is separate from "Network device support"
(
