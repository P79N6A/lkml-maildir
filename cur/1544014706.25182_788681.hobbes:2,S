I had some code a long time ago that used SSE (I think movlps was the
opcode I chose) to get an atomic 64-bit PIO operation.  To do that, I
just needed to disable preemption and save/restore cr0 around the SSE
operation, and just save/restore the single xmm register I used.  Of
course it only works on CPUs that have SSE.  That avoids the nastiness
of x87/mmx state, but in the end a spinlock around two readl()s was
faster and a ton simpler, so I threw all that code away.
