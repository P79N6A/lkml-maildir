Zope and Apache (with mod_dav, that is) are SERVERS, not CLIENTS.

It will not help. Talk is about usage of WebDAV like NFS or CODA: ability to
mount web-server with DAV extensions, etc. I'm not sure if it's REALLY belond
to server. May be GNOME libvfs and KDE what-the-name-of-such-lib-there is better
place: HTTP (with or without DAV) is hardly useful as replacement for NFS or
CODA.
