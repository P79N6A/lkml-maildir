i recently got the new disks and could backup nearly everything (after reboot the disks were accessible again, though i've lost some data).
i tried to zero out the disk with 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdX' which led to a complete system lockup after some time.
after a reboot i wanted to run the long S.M.A.R.T. tests (smartctl -t long /dev/hdX, smartctl v5.26). it said that it is backgrounding for about 80 minutes. but again after some time => complete lockup.
i couldn't do anything anymore on the server, only sysrq-keys were working. killing the processes gave me some error messages (can't remember the exact wording but they were like: "DMA lost" on nearly every disk and some weird interrupt errors (related to the NIC).

don't know if the ERR-rate is too high, this is with an uptime of 5 days. i usually have much higher ERR numbers.
