Good luck with those.  :)
I finally looked at this on 2.5.59.  The fs menu certainly
needs some help/work, so I'd like to see you keep plugging away
at this.  I didn't see much feedback -- was there feedback?
Maybe on a different subject/thread?  A newer version that I
missed?

I find it odd that "help" in a Kconfig file can be spelled
"help" or "---help---", but "--help--" leads to errors.

I expected to just see the filesystems listed in alpha order,
but I don't have a problem with the groupings that you
have made for them.
Thanks,
