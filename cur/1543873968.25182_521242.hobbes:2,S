Please use
	git diff -M --stat --summary 
to generate the diffstat (where the "-M" is the important part). Your 
"scc_pata.c" change was a pure rename, but because you didn't ask for 
rename detection, it got shown as a file create/delete pair. It *should* 
have looked like this:
 drivers/ide/Kconfig                       |   48 +++++------------------------
 drivers/ide/Makefile                      |    1 -

 rename drivers/ide/{ppc => pci}/scc_pata.c (100%)
which is a lot more accurate than what you get by feeding a diff through 
"diffstat" that has no clue about renames (look at the summary for number 
of lines changed ;)
