    Yes. The whole linux community is proud of it.

    But I am not saying "stop whatever you are doing and start afresh.
  I am only saying "why can't we do whatever we are doing in an
  organised manner". If we can foresee that something is going to 
  happen that is bad for linux why can't we avoid them in the first
  place. Never ever ignore something because it was found in the text
  books. The great software engineering models that are found in those
  text books are not just an academician's theory that he put forth
  sitting in a room. They are all outputs by experienced people who
  had bad outcomes from their crude development models.

     Everyone, welcomes this approach of distributed development model.
  But it is never a brilliant idea to make redundant attempts. Your
  view of the Linux development model is something like Darwin's theory
  of evolution. He said "the fittest will survive". But that is nature.
  That is how it will happen and it will always happen. But it will
  take it's own time to happen. It will not happen whenever we like.
  We can't afford to let things happen in Linux. We have to make things
  happen. 
     Regression testing may not be catching everything that is buggy 
  in the software. But that's not the question of the development
  model itself. It is the question of the perfectness of the model.
  No engineering model is perfect. But every software engineering model
  should tend to be perfect.

    As I already said without design certainly at some point of time
  it is going to adapt but not quickly. It will take its own time.

    It would never kill it. It would accelerate it.
