The reason why some are using dual CPU machines for clusters instead of
single CPU machines is that (properly setup) you can make use of the
automatic load balancing on the SMP nodes to smooth out your CPU loading
slightly. If you use two seperate machines and one becomes idle for a
moment you have to do more work to make it busy again then if you have a
couple of processes running on a SMP machine where if one goes idle
another can make use of the slack.
you can argue both ways on the effectivness of this, it is being looked
into becouse 2 CPU SMP boxes are becoming cheap enough to experiment
with. the jury is still out on it as far as I know.
