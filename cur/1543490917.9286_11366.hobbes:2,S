I found the problem. It's a bad interaction with glibc's malloc()
implementation and programming proctice.
malloc() uses mmap() for large memory chunks. Tghis mapping occurs at
an memory area where the oracle programmers want to put their shared
memory area. Look into the new strace oputput done with `strace -f '
to catpure the child process.
You see that mmap() happens around the same memory addres which is
passed to the shmat() call as the desired address parameter.
Solutions?
o either change the program to use no address or another
  address for the shmat() call,
o configure glibc's malloc() to not use mmap 
o Use another malloc() implementation and apply the LD_PRELOAD trick
  to activate it.
o change the address choosing algorithm for mmap()ed areas in the
  kernel
