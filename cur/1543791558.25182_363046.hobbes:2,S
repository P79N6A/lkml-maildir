Not using large page mappings for the kernel area will be a substantial
performance hit. It's a less efficient approach inside the hypervisor, 
and not all VMs / hardware can support it.

Sigh. You seem obsessed with this. There are various critical places in
the kernel that use higher order allocations. Yes, they're normally
smaller ones rather than larger ones, but .... please try re-reading
the earlier portions of this thread. You are NOT going to be able to
get rid of all higher-order allocations - please quit pretending you
can - living in denial is not going to help us.
If you really, really believe you can do that, please go ahead and prove
it. Until that point, please let go of the "it's only for a few specialized
users" arguement, and acknowledge we DO actually use higher order allocs
in the kernel right now.

It's a regression test. To, like, test for regressions in the normal
case ;-)

Having met some of them ... that's not a pro ;-) We have quite enough
meaningless tunables already. And to be honest, the bigger problem is
that it's a problem with no correct answer - workloads shift day vs.
night, etc.

Thanks for turning my 64 bit system back into a 32 bit one. really 
appreciate that. Note the last 5 years of endless whining about all
the problems with large 32 bit systems, and how they're unfixable
and we should all move to 64 bit please.

That's because you're not listening, you're going on your own preconcieved
notions ...

Ditto.
