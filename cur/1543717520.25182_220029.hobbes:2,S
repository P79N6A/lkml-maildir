Yeah. There definitely is a need for userspace apps to be power-aware,
and have the ability to prevent suspend, but I think this should all be
done via the daemon (talking to apps via D-BUS?) and then the daemon
pulls the trigger if all power-aware apps in userspace agree it's OK. I
don't think ACPI kernel code should do anything without being told to.
The kernel sleep interface should only ever be used by the daemon. If
the user decides to use it from the cmdline then things aren't going to
work right.
