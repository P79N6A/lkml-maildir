I've a problem Because when the PCMCIA start, I've the message :
PCI : NO IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 01:02.0 please try
using pci=bios, but when this parametre, IRQ is always unknow.
But when kernel Start, I've this message : 
PCI : Probing PCI hardware
Unknow bridge ressource 2: assuming transparent
PCI : Using IRQ router PIIX [8086/244c] at 00:1f.0
Thank in advance for help.

   PCMCIA work with kernel 2.2.19, but with this kernel there's no
usb-storage (for usb zip) support
