That's nothing, I've had iMac usb keyboard typing "cdcd " instead of
"cd " when I typed too fast.
That really drived me mad. I found out that keyboard just can't cope
with me pressing ("c down" "d down" "space down" "c up") -- all normal
keyboards can handle that normally.
Check that you are not pressing something like I did -- it happens
pretty often when you touch-type.
