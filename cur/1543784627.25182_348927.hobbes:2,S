BTW Anton, while looking for the best permission masks to be used when
mounting my NTFS paritions, I spotted what I think is a bug, or at
least an inconsistency between the way all fs drivers I use handle
umasks & friends, and the way NTFS does it. Basically, all the other
fs drivers take an octal representation of the masks. NTFS, instead,
seems to use _decimal_
(Of course, the spontaneous question is how comes that there isn't a
common fs code to read the common options?)
