Subject: 2.3.7 filesystems not compiling.

For example, when compiling fs/minix/file.c
file.c: In function `minix_write_one_page':
file.c:64 warning: implicit declaration of function `block_write_one_page'
file.c: At top level:
file.c:107: `generic_readpage' undeclared here (not in a function)
file.c:107: initializer element for `minix_file_inode_operations.bmap' is
not constant
file.c:109: warning: initialization from incompatable pointer type
file.c:110: warning: initialization from incompatable pointer type
file.c:114: warning: initialization from incompatable pointer type
make[4]: *** [file.o] Error 1
make[4]: Leaving directory /usr/local/src/linux-2.3.7/fs/minix
make[3]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
....
and then proceeds to exit up the filesystem and die.
Had this with pre-2.3.7-10 but 2.3.7 got released while I was trying to
find it.
Other filesystems have the same problem. I removed minix support and fat
bombed. pre-2.3.7-9 compiled fine.
This was copied by hand so typos are possible but it looks like a good
copy to me.
