Pat, it looks like hwgraph_path_lookup() is only used in the PCI hotplug
code, and is messed up anyway (it's looking for a SCSI controller??), so
we can probably kill the addition of that function.

Yeah, it would be nice to avoid introducing stuff that just gets deleted
in later patches.

Yes, I think we do have more xswitches coming...

If this stuff is going to be used by more than just ia64, it should
probably be moved to another directory/file.

Pat, will the patches work if we omit 071 and 075?  If so, maybe we can
get the others merged in and continue to work on the last two.
