Yes, I know this. But currently, __NR_mremap does not exit in Blackfin
unistd.h:
/* 163 __NR_mremap */.
So the implementation of this kind syscalls should be in uClibc, right?
And Bernd said that the kernel version mremap/munmap is not very useful
for Blackfin arch. I think mremap/munmap can be ignored in Blackfin.
Thanks
