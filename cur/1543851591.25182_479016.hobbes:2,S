Some tricks to avoid journal --- see

--- unlike journaling it survives only 65536 crashes :)

This critical section is long --- i.e. any reads/writes to disk. Making it 
simple semaphore would effectively serialize all operations.

It is down_write -> (tailcall) down_write_nested -> (normal call) 
spin_lock_irq and spin_unlock_irq.

But it kills one cacheline.

Maybe one day I'll try it.

I see, but pushf, cli and popf in that spinlock hurt too (especially on 
Intel, it has them completely microcoded --- pushf/popf pair is 100 
ticks on Intel P4E and 12 ticks on Opteron).
