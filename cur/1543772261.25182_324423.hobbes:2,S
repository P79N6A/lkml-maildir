I haven't finished it, but it looks great so far.  Are you planning to
repost it to LKML, or otherwise publish it somewhere, after incorporating
feedback?
If you don't mind, I would like to put a copy on the CELF wiki.  But
if it's going to have a home elsewhere, I don't want to create a
duplicate copy.
