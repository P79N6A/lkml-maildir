It would be really nice to do something about that two millisecond
busywait for RT tasks in sys_nanosleep().  It's really foul.
The rudest thing about it is that programmers think "oh, let's
be nice to the machine and use usleep(1000)".  Boy, do they
get a shock when they switch their pthread app to use an
RT policy.
Does anyone have any clever ideas?
