Maybe you should just "daemonize" your kernel threads. I put
an example to 
http://www.scs.ch/~frey/linux/kernelthreads.html
With all the setup I do in the example there, I can load/unload
a module with launching a thread on load over night without
getting a zombie.
However, I just tested that on 2.2.14, Intel and Alpha platform.
Best regards,
