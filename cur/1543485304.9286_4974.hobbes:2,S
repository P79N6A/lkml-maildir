According to `man ps`, D state signfies "uninterruptible sleep".  The
process is usually waiting for an I/O to complete, or thinks it is.  I 
think the recent problems with the kernel causing this was indeed a
bug.  I forget the exact reason, but it was something to do with
memory management.
I haven't had this problem running linux-2.2.1-ac5.  Does anyone know
the expected differences between 2.2.2 and 2.2.1-ac5?  Alan's patch
has been very stable for me.
