Has this been fixed in 2.6?  If so, it would improve the speed of mail
servers that use maildir, (I think mbox should be ok, since the data that
was appended has a good chance of still being in memory.  Though, to compute
UIDL for pop3, it has to read the entire mbox file, forcing other mbox users
out of cache, and then evening up performance between the two.  Though this
patch should help maildir more.)
