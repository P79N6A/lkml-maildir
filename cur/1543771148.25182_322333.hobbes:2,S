FWIW the decoupling of interrupt mask levels from
spinlocks is a technique which predates the patent
under discussion by a decade or so.  And yes IANAL
as well but it seems the patent would/should not
have been awarded if it conflicted/overlapped with
preexisting usage.  I'd hazard this is a non-issue.
