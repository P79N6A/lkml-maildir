But now it's inefficient again.
Why not this:
                LOCK    "   decl (%%eax)        \n"                     \
                        "   jns 1f              \n"                     \
                        "   call "#fail_fn"     \n"                     \
                        "1:                     \n"                     \
                                                                        \
                :"=a" (dummy)                                           \
                : "a" (count)                                           \
Will the extra taken forward conditional jump in the fastpath cause much of
a slowdown?
