OK.  Unless there is a difference in this respect on i386 vs x86_64 in
2.6.3-rc2-mm1, this is needed for the thread support which is in this
version, but not the -mm version.  OTOH, if there is a cleaner way of
doing this, and there indeed might be (I need to sit down and re-read
some of the previous threads), I'm all ears, not tied to doing it that
way, etc, etc.
