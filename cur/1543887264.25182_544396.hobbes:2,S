1 slab per object not one page. But yes thats some bloat.
You can pull the big switch (only on a SLUB slab I fear) to switch 
off the fast path. Do SetSlabDebug() when allocating a precious 
allocation that should not be gobbled up by lower level processes. 
Then you can do whatever you want in the __slab_alloc debug section and we 
wont care because its not the hot path.
SLAB is a bit different. There we already have issues with the fast path 
due to the attempt to handle numa policies at the object level. SLUB fixes 
that issue (if we can avoid you hot path patch). It intentionally does 
defer all special object handling to the slab level to increase NUMA 
performance. If you do the same to SLAB then you will get the NUMA 
troubles propagated to the SMP and UP level.
