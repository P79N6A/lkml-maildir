All the apps are supposed to use /dev/random, so that's correct.
For Hardware RNGs, userspace rngd daemon obtains entropy, checks it 
(mainly checking for hardware failures), and then stuffs entropy into 
the kernel random device.   
http://sf.net/projects/gkernel/
On the "to do" list is making rngd directly generate entropy use 
'xstore' on VIA CPUs, rather than going kernel -> userland -> kernel.
Also, there are other entropy daemons floating about.  I think there is 
one that obtains noise from an audio device.
