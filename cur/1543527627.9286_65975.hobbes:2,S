I hate all these 16-bit assembly code modifications.
Why do I care whether ds/es changes during the e820 call? And why should
the 16-bit asm code care?
Why not just have the asm code be Simple, Stupid and Straightforward (the
rule of asm: follow the three "S"es).  None of this config crap in asm
that is impossible to follow, why not just have the asm code
 - save state before the e820 call
 - save the result of the e820 call buffer
 - save the register state after the e820 call.
 - do the old-style calls regardless
Then, the decision on whether we actually _trust_ the results can be done
in plain C code, instad of having this jungle of assembly language.. No
conditionals, no complex decisions on whether to sanity-check the results,
no complexity in assembly code. We can do the real parsing later.
This was my argument against the original e820 patches (and they got
cleaned up, at which point it got applied), and it's my argument against
this new version too. I don't like assembly language, and I like it even
less when it is full of config options.
Oh, and btw - the C code you _do_ have is mis-indented.
