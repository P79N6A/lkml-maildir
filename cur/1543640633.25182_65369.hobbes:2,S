I don't mind a few deviceid switches. I don't find them annoying and
I'll take the stability of using known good code with the daft bits like
the rate filter while loop fixed over the unknowns of changing the code.
Once its in 2.4 and 2.5 and it works then I'm all ears, because at that
point we can actively quantify and test for regressions
