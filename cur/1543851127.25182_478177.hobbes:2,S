Hi,
it looks as if SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE & SG_SET_RESERVED_SIZE
are not in interaction with the underlying SCSI transport.
Programs like readcd and cdda2wav that try to get very large SCSI
transfer buffers get a confirmation for nearly any SCSI transfer size 
but later when readcd/cdda2wav try to transfer data with an
actual SCSI command, they fail with ENOMEM.
Correct fix: let sg.c make a callback to the underlying SCSI transport
		and let it get a confirmation tfor the buffer size.
Quick and dirty fix: reduce the maximum allowed DMA size to the smallest
		max DMA size of all SCSI transports.
Jörg
