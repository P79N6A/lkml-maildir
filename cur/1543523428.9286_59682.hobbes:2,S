If that is really what the RNG does, then it's useless. What you describe
is equivalent to a normal algorithmic pseudo-random number generator.
The documents I've found on Intel's developer web site do not describe how
the random number generator works.
If the index is somehow "randomly" (not algorithmically) generated, then
there is no point in having an array of 2^16 bytes! You could just return
the index as your random number. So a large array implies an algorithmic
approach, which means the RNG will return little if any real entropy.
Entropy has to come from somewhere something unguessable. Thermal
fluctuations or quantum spin states (Stern-Gerlach device, anyone) work
well in theory. But there is a difference between theory and practice...
