What about the wanrouter subsystem? It's considered broken? I wrote a
driver for a serial sync board with X.25 firmware, should I stick with
wanrouter or rewrite my driver as a normal network driver? I'm beginning
to study the BSD socket approach used in sangoma boards to give raw access
to X.25 (which is implemented in firmware in the cyclom2x boards, I don't 
have access to hdlc in this board), it's wise to use the sangoma drivers
approach or think about something else?
