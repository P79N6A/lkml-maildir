Hi all,
I am using software watchdog in my application.  When the watchdog reboots the
system,
>>>printk(KERN_CRIT "SOFTDOG: Initiating system reboot.\n"); prints the message
on the console.
I put a delay of 5secs with mdelay, and I can see the message on the console.
I wanted the message as a syslog,
so I added         kern.crit in /etc/syslog.conf file.,
But I am not getting the above message in the log file.
Can any one help me with this ????
Thanks
Girish
