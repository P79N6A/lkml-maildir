Are you sure you don't have HardIRQS in Threads enabled? Also are you
sure the kernel boots without the rt patch applied.

ARM is supported, but specific boards are hit or miss.. 
I've had OMAP working _in the past_ with this patch applied,
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/10/59
There was also a patch released on one of the OMAP lists a while back
from Dirk Behme to get OMAP working on a mor recent rt release..
