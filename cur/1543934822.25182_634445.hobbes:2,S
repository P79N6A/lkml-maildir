The reason according to Microsoft is that enabling PAE induced driver
incompatibilities - to me it sounds quite plausible given the quality of drivers
for consumer versions of XP/Vista and the fact that 4GB RAM in consumer class
machine is a newer thing.
There is a KB document detailing the reasons for disabling >4Gb RAM in XP SP2
and later 32-bit OSes -
