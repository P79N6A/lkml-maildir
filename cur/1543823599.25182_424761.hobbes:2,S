Hi!
We're having trouble here with our data acquisition systems when  
recording some 10MB/s from a PCI card to a file on NFS, using write 
()'s of about 8kB. I thought is was connected to running X at the  
same time, but without X it also happened and I got part of a backtrace:
[scrolled off]
kdb
die
vprintk
do_page_fault
do_page_fault
iput
load_balance_newidle
schedule
do_page_fault
error_code
nfs_dentry_iput
iput
nfs_dentry_iput
prune_dcache
shrink_dcache_memory
shrink_slab
balance_pgdat
prepare_to_wait
kswapd
[...]
The system is Scientific Linux CERN 4.3, based on RHEL4, kernel  
2.6.9-34.EL.cernsmp, running on a two-way Xeon. What I'd like to know  
is whether a page fault can legally happen while shrinking the  
dcache; this sounds a bit counterintuitive to me. If anyone has an  
idea where to look for the cause of the crash, you're welcome.
Ciao,
                     Roland

UNIX was not designed to stop you from doing stupid things, because that
would also stop you from doing clever things.
