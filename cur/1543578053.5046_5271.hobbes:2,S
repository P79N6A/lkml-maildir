Sure.  But sendfile is not one of the fundamental UNIX operations...
If there was no alternative to this I would probably have not said
anything, but with the rw_kiovec file op just before the door I don't
see any reason to add this _very_ specific file operation.
An alloc_kiovec before and an free_kiovec after the actual call
and the memory overhaed of a kiobuf won't hurt so much that it stands
against a clean interface, IMHO.

You get that multiple page call with kiobufs for free...
