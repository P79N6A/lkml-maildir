Hello everyone,
I have released Xtables 1.5.2, which is a package of my ongoing
iptables development. It contains a few patches that make it easier
to build (no kernel source required¹!), and... see shortlog below. I
just rebased it on top of the new converted-from-svn iptables git
tree (which still needs to be officially embraced..); once that
happens it will hopefully merge.  Still, it is stable and can replace
an older iptables package.
Then there is Xtables-addons 1.5.2 out now, which does not have any
new striking changes; just a fix to let it work with older GNU makes
and that it does not depend on the same Xtables version anymore. 
(kernel-source required here, in case you ask.)
I have gotten a number of inquiries regarding Xtables modules, and
yes, I am taking submissions into Xtables-addons.
