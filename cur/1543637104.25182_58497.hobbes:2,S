Hi Neil,
I've experienced the same problem with some of my own code.  I came up with
the following macro to help solve the problem:
/* Given a pointer to a member of a struct, return a pointer to the struct
   itself. */
#define BackPtr(ptr, type, member) ({                                         \
        typeof( ((type *)0)->member ) *__mptr = (ptr);                        \
        ((type *)( (char *)__mptr - (unsigned long)(&((type *)0)->member) ));})

I don't think this is necessary.  The compiler can get this information
from the type/member parameters and the typeof() call.

Ugh..  I had a similar naming dilemma - I choose BackPtr (because the
macro causes a negative pointer offset).
