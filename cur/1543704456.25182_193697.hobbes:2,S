OK, I would like to make my bug report more accurate: the problem seems to
be that the value of btime in /proc/stat is not correct. procps uses that to
calculate the start time of a process.
date +%s ; cat /proc/uptime ; grep btime /proc/stat
1075028140
1393207.63 1379643.46
btime 1073634689
Time now (1075028140) minus uptime (1393207.63) is 1073634932 (the correct
bootup time). btime differs from that by 243 seconds, so that's the error of
four minutes in ps output. Just to check, a line from syslog:
Jan  9 09:55:41 elektroni kernel: Linux version 2.6.1 (kaukasoi@elektroni) (gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)) #1 Fri Jan 9 09:54:37 EET 2004
and from that
date +%s --date='Jan  9 09:55:41'
1073634941
ok, syslogd seems to have started 9 seconds after bootup.
This is athlon tb 1400 and I run ntpd.
