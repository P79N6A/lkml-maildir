0.9-alpha Version
o Fixed patch in NEWS to leave #include linux/elf.h, needed for
  CONFIG_KALLSYMS.
o Fixed extra newline in "in use by" message.
o Fixed parsing for new-style /proc/modules.
o Fixed version parsing code (thanks to Adam Richter's report)
o Fixed "running out of filedescriptors" (Adam Richter)	
o Implemented options in modprobe
o Implemented install in modprobe
o Implemented options in modules.conf2modprobe.conf
o Implemented install in modules.conf2modprobe.conf
o Implemented probeall in modules.conf2modprobe.conf
o Implemented probe in modules.conf2modprobe.conf
o Changed modprobe version to be constant string, for "strings" to work easily.
Lightly tested, but seems to work here.  No source RPM, since it's
still alpha.
Thanks!
Rusty.
