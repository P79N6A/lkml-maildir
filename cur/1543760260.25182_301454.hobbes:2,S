Are you sure it's plain 2.6.11 and not some bk clone of after 2.6.11 was
released ?
I just found a bug in the ppc64 ioremap code that got triggered by
the set_pte_at() patch that went into bk after 2.6.11 and that triggers
exactly that error, but I couldn't see anything wrong in 2.6.11 proper.
BTW, Linus: Any chance you ever change something to version or
extraversion in bk just after a release ? I know I already ask and it
degenerated into a flamefest, and I don't know if that is specifically
the case now, but I keep getting report of people saying "I have a bug
in 2.6.xx" while in fact, they have some kind of bk clone of sometime
after 2.6.xx...
