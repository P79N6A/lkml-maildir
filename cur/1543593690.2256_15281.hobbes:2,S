Hi,
 just being curious. Since 2.4.4, I am watching my systems memory
behaviour a bit:-) Just recently I realized the following: in the
evening I leave my 128MB system at about 20 MB, 2 MB Buffered and 100 MB
Cached (plus som 40 MB unneccesary swap :-)). When I come back in the
morning, Used is still at 20 MB (a bit down maybe) but Buffered is 50 MB
and Cached is 55 MB. For a few minutes the system is definitely more
sluggish than in the evening. Something I can excuse before my first cup
of coffe anyway...
 So, what actually is the difference between Buffered and Cached.
Apparently quite a lot of the pages that are Cached in the evening are
Buffered 9 houres later.
Thanks
Martin
