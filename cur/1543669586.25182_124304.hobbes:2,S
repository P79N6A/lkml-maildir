    Here is my problem..
    #insmod ips.o
      < found 10 disks>
    #insmod qla2300.o
      < found 10 disks>
    #rmmod ips.o
       <removed 10 disks>
    #insmod ips.o
      <found 10 disks - but new names>
OK, I see what you mean. I agree.

[I see that dougg wants to solve such things by properly naming,
but that is a higher level. Given a large number space an
easier solution is to give each module its own part of the
number space.]
