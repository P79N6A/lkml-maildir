Yes, that would be nice. Anyway, finding the document I mentioned will
be much harder than I thought. Googling last 15 minutes didn't make
progress. But, I'll keep trying.
Anyway, here is how Aix defines it:
 Average percentage of CPU time that the CPUs were idle during which
 the system had an outstanding disk I/O request. This value may be
 inflated if the actual number of I/O requesting threads is less than
 the number of idling processors.

Also, Sun has a nice collection of articles at
http://www.sun.com/sun-on-net/itworld/,
 and among them
http://www.sun.com/sun-on-net/itworld/UIR981001perf.html
 which speaks
about wait time, but I'm still searching for a more technical document...
