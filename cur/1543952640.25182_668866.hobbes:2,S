Paul:
just wanted to let you know that I did manage to hit this list
corruption--same stack trace:  cgroup_exit() from do_exit() ...--on
25-rc3-mm1 WITHOUT any of the vm scalability [split-lru/noreclaim-mlock]
patches applied.  This occurred ~9 minutes into a fairly heavy 'usex'
load on my 16 cpu ia64 platform.
An x86_64 version [w/ prebuilt binaries of the tools used] of the stress
load is available here:
	
http://free.linux.hp.com/~lts/Temp/
There's a README there describing the contents of the tarball.  I
haven't tried this load on an x86_64 recently, so I don't know if it
will trigger the problem there.
