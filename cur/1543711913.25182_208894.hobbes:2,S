I'd find the PT_GNU_STACK approach much more appealing if it actually
was used to get rid of the stack-special case in the kernel
altogether.  Certainly it seems like it could be used to get rid of
STACK_TOP (just use the segment's p_vaddr).  That would still leave
the TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE special-case, but at least it would be a step
in the right direction.  Also, in the case of ia64, p_memsz could be
used to give user-level control over whether they want the
register/memory stacks to grow towards each other or apart from each
other.
