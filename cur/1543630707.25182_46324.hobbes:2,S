Yep... should never wait inside an ISR, to say nothing about
the potential wait-forever.
Even if the chip never breaks, you end up with reports like..
"Strange, I make frisbees when buring CDs while M$ machines do
backups over the network..."
Or, I can't play ".wav" files anymore unless I unplug from the
network...
Stuff has to play together. Sometimes this means you can't get
the maximum-theoretical-possible through-put from your connected
devices.
The worse-case driver is where the programmer decided to turn
interrupts back on in the ISR.... to let higher-priority interrupts
occur...  FYI, there are always higher-priority interrupts that
will take the CPU away... you lose big-time.
