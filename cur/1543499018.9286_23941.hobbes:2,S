routers per-se should not forward broadcast packets... or bad things
might occur (possible variation of smurf attacks, etc).
some routers have `helper' facilities that allow them to forward
certain types of broadcast packets. This could be implemented in
user-space fairly easily I think... (provided nothing else was
stopping you receiving the interesting packets).
