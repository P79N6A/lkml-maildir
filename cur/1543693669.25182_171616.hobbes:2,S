To my knowledge, the ac series has the only up to date pnpbios patch for 2.4.
You may, however, want to try the latest 2.6-test kernel which ships with an
improved pnpbios driver.  Is there a particular PnPBIOS feature you are looking
for in 2.4?  In other words which PnPBIOS services interest you?
Thanks,
Adam
