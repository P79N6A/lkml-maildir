Think edge triggered verse level triggered. Event interfaces in the Linux
kernel are sort of just that, edge triggered events. What RT folks generally
want is control over scheduling policies over a particular time period in
relation to a scheduling policy. A general kernel event interface isn't
going to cut it for those purpose and wasn't design to deal with those cases
in the first place.
