Hi,
I'm not sure if a similar patch has been submitted or not, but here is a 
patch to get DMA working on ASUS K8S-MX with a SiS 760GX/SiS 965L 
chipset combo.
I'm looking at trying to revive the old sis190.c net driver for this 
board too, this does depend on my boss giving me some development time.
Anyway, this is my first kernel patch so I hope it helps.
Regards
Andrew
