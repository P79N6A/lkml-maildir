| Wouldn't it make sense to avoid the need to do this in the future?

| Specifically, make a tree named "linux" available - that's always the
| Linus tree.
| 
| Create linux-2.6/2.8/3.0/3.2 etc as they are handed off to maintainers
| *other* than Linus?
| 
| Or some combination that makes sense.  It just seems weird to me to need

Continually, as in every 2-3 years?  I don't see much of a problem
