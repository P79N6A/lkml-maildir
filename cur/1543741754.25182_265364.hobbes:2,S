Can you test out the trivial extension, which is to allow any power-of-two
constant, and just leave it as a divide in those cases (and let the
compiler turn it into a 64-bit shift)?
It's very easy to test for powers of two: !((x) & ((x)-1)) does it for 
everything but zero, and zero in this case is an error anyway.
