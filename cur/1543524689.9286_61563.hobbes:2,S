Hi all.
We are testing an Athlon system with the following configuration:
MB MS-6167, Athlon 650, 128 MB RAM, 2 Quantum Fireball KX 27.3GB 7200rpm,
ethernet D-Link 100Mbps DFE-538TX. Linux kernel is a 2.2.15pre5 with
ide.2.2.15-5.20000127 and latest raid beta from RedHat. UDMA on disks
is active.
Our feeling on overall performances is: STUNNING! But we're experiencing
a slowdown in interactive performances during high disk activity.
Apparently, especially under X, the system swaps-out pages "aggressively"
to allocate more and more buffer-cache.
One test which freeze almost completely the system is:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/1 bs=1024k &
/home is a 20GB raid1 (mirrored) filesystem (dd is stopping at 2GB file limit).
A similar 2.2.15pre1-based kernel gave same result. Again on a 2.2.12-20
plain RedHat 6.1 kernel. The same test on a similar host on a not-raid disk
gave the same result.
Is a vm-subsystem problem (too many cache allocated)? Is a IDE subsystem
problem (too large queues, especially in writing)?
The system is not in production (yet), so we can run other tests or benchmarks
needed/requested to better diagnose the problem.
Please cc to me, since I'm not subscribed.
Best wishes,
	Gabriele Turchi
