I've got a RedHat 9 Linux 2.4.20-20.9 box with Cisco aironet 350 series 
wireless adapter.
The problem appears when I start tcpdump on that interface. For few 
second everything seems normal, but after couple of second the traffic 
hangs down. The signal strength and quolity matter show that it's 
working just fine, but neither there is ping response or any traffic 
passes through the interface.
I maintain few linux boxes and noticed that problem with RedHat 8.0.
The latest Redhat distro hasing no problems is 7.3 with kernel 2.4.18-3.
Any latest version hangs down...
here is some informatios as recomended:
lsmod:

jbd                    51924   2  [ext3]
There is no indication fot trouble in /var/log/messages
Shell script .. hmm
(install Cisco Aironet 350 Series Wireless Adapter) and run:
#!/bin/bash
modprobe airo
ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1
echo "SSID" > /proc/driver/aironet/eth0/SSID
tcpdump -qn -i eth0
Notice that there must be a traffic going throug the access poit (some 
other clients must be connected too, and generate traffic). I've tested 
the situation when only I was a client in that AP and no problem 
occured. (Hope that will help you)

But I may be repeating myself by saying that this is not a single box 
problem.
Here is the PCI information:

        Region 2: I/O ports at d600 [size=64]
no SCSI...
no patches or fixes (except that provided by RedHat)
