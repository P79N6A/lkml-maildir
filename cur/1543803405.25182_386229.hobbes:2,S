Yes, after you have dropped all your claims to pin this page
(ie. pte lock). You really can't take a refcount on a page that
you haven't somehow pinned (only I can ;)). This get_page_testone
code used by reclaim is a tricky special case where the page is
pinned by lru_lock even if it is "free" (ie. zero refcount).
It is not something that you can use without being very careful.
And I don't understand why you would want to even if it did work,
after you take a look at the simplicity of my patch.

By this stage the page may have been freed, and reused by an
unrelated pagecache on the LRU. I'm not sure if there are any
worse races than this (ie. random page being moved), but I
wouldn't like to risk it.

kswapd picks them off the lru as normal part of scanning. A
WARN_ON is simply spam.
