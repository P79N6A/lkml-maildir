Note that on a 32-bit machine, toff_t, used as fpos_t, for file offsets,
i.e., lseek, is unsigned 32 bits. You will not be able to access such a
file on a 32-bit machine. There has been some work on changing this
to 'long long' (__kernel_loff_t, in ../asm/posix_types.h although you may
need a new 'C' runtime library to take advantage of this.
What on earth are you doing with a single _file_ of that size? If you
need a gob of storage for data acquisition, you might be better off
with a dedicated raw device. Since you access it in blocks, rather than
bytes, you won't have a size limitation for a few more years.
