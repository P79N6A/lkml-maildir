File locking, meaning lockd? There are so many problems with file locking in
heterogeneous environments that we were moving towards dropping its usage.
Instead, we planned to use some home grown TCP based lock server mechanism. 
I understand that locking file flushes NFS cache, isn't it? Why can't it be
flushed by O_SYNC and "sync" options presence? This would make the life much
easier for programmers...
This means that we will never be able to drop lockd locking and at the same
time achieve file consistency via NFS?
Best,
Giga
