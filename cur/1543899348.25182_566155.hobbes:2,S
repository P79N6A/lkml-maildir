So you want me to handle _malicious_ filesystems now?
That should be easy... :-). You already have nasty deadlocks in FUSE,
and you solve them by "root can echo 1 > abort"... so allow me the
same possibility.
We can tell fused we are freezing, and if all the requests are not
serviced within, say, 30 seconds, we call the filesystem malicious and
do echo 1 > abort.
Not ideal, but neither is allowing malicious filesystems in the first
place...

Not nice, but we don't know any better for now. "Just fix all the
drivers" basically means "just fix 90% of kernel".
