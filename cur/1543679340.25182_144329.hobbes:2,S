Subject: NFS structure allocation alignment patch

Hi Trond, Marcelo,
Below is a patch against 2.4.21 to tidy up the allocation of two
structures in nfs3_proc_unlink_setup.  We need this change for NFS to
work on the sh64 architecture, which has just been merged into 2.4 in
the last couple of days.  Otherwise, 'res' is 4-byte aligned but not
necessarily 8-byte aligned, but struct nfs_attr contains fields that are
8 bytes wide.  This leads to alignment exceptions on loads and stores
into that structure.
Can you consider this for inclusion before 2.4.22 please?
[BTW this is the same fix we discussed about 3 months ago; I didn't get
around to re-submitting the fix at the time].
Regards,
Richard Curnow
