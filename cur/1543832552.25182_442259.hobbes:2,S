I'm kidding of course. Putting the names in a file is crap.
This is what procps-1.x.xx did long ago. Everybody hated it.
You'll never handle chroot correctly.
Just do /proc/*/tty links and all will be good. This even
handles the case of two different names for the same dev_t.
If people seriously want to bring back the crap, then I can
design something tolerable. It would support mmap MAP_SHARED,
allowing live updates so that "top" can work nicely.
