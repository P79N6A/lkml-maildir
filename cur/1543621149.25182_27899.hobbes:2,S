Is this a buspowered device and if so, how much power does this drain from
the USB? I'm asking because I've just solved (kind of) a similar issue
with a 400mA device when I introduced the missing
connect-detect-to-port-reset debounce delay.

hub.c selects the address and calls usb_new_device from usb.c, which sets
(applies) the new address.
