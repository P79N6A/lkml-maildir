Thank god thats not the case. We did a patent research on this last year
and the result was that you can replace the cli/sti by a software flag
in the OS itself without violating the patent.
The combination of replacing it in the host OS and running said host OS
as an idle task of the underlying RTOS would violate the patent.
So if PREEMPT-RT would use a soft cli/sti emulation, no problem should
arise.
