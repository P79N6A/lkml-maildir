When booting 2.4.6 on my K62 with ALI chipset, I get the following:
ACPI: Core Subsystem version [20010615]
Scheduling in interrupt
kernel BUG at sched.c:709!
invalid operand: 0000
...
Process swapper (pid:1, stackpage=c1219000)
This is repeatable. I know you may want a ksymoops dump, but I'll only
do that on request, since I don't want to waste my time copying it if
this is an already-fixed bug. Let me know.
