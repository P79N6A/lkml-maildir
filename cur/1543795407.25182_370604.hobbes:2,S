Dell Latitude D610, FC4 base distro, kernel is:
[asuardi@sandman ~]$ cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.6.15-rc2-git4 (asuardi@sandman) (gcc version 4.0.1
20050727 (Red Hat 4.0.1-5)) #2 Fri Nov 25 00:15:46 CET 2005
Onboard wireless card as detected by kernel is:
ipw2200: Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2200/2915 Network Driver, git-1.0.8
 and I placed the 2.4 firmware from sourceforge.net in /lib/firmware.
ifup eth1 yields this message:
eth1: NETDEV_TX_BUSY returned; driver should report queue full via
ieee_device->is_queue_full.
I'm connected to my wireless DSL router while typing this mail
 so it obviously isn't fatal...
Thanks,
