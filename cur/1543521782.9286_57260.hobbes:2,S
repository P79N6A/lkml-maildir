I will give this a try when I get the chance.  We have seen no other
evidence of corruption, however; the same operation which caused the
problem succeeded the second time.

Also stock Linux 2.2.14.

This is my guess, actually.  knfsd seems somewhat fragile, especially
on SMP systems (like our file server).  Here are some later log
messages from the same problem.  We received several hundred thousand
of these:

The "elaborate" directory was one of the ones etags was processing;
the user was actively editing files within when the disaster occurred.
I am guessing some rename or deletion happened at just the wrong time,
triggering a race condition in knfsd.

It would be nice if several people could audit whatever knfsd stuff
shows up in the stable kernels, particularly with an eye towards
concurrency issues.  (It seems that all of our problem NFS boxes are
SMP systems.)
It would also be nice to see a working knfsd in kernel 2.2.x...
