all of that assumes that the kernel boots not one word about kernel 
configuration
(as far as what may interfeaf with it working it dosen't say wether or 
not it needs swsusp
turned on I tryed it with swsusp on and off same thing )
not one word about troble shooting the olny thing about it that did work 
for me was that
the patch applyed to the 2.6.13 kernel source I can't even get the 
kernel to build with
swsusp2 turned off on a patched kernel source
this is veary veary alpha it compiles and thats as far as I can get with it
OK it works for you I'm not willing to put anymore effort in to it
