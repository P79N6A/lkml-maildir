When replacing calls to remap_pfn_rage() with calls to remap_valloc_range():
- remap_pfn_range() sets VM_IO|VM_RESERVED|VM_PFNMAP on the user's vma. 
  remap_valloc_range() sets only VM_RESERVED.
- remap_pfn_range() has special handling for COWable user vma's, but
  remap_valloc_range() does not.
- are vma->vm_start and vma->vm_end always a multiple of PAGE_SIZE?  (I
  always forget).  If not, remap_valloc_range() looks a tad buggy.
pls explain.
- remap_valloc_range() can use ~PAGE_MASK, not PAGE_SIZE-1
- remap_valloc_range() would lose a whole buncha typecasts if you use the
  gcc pointer-arith-with-void* extension.
