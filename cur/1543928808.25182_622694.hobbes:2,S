I don't see that as a problem and it's not clear why you do.
It doesn't matter whether a kobject has been registered or not; once
it has been initialized you _should_ call kobject_put().  (Although
it's okay to call kfree() if the name hasn't been set yet.)
The same is true of larger objects.  Once you have called
device_initialize(), you _should_ call device_put() (although it's okay
to call kfree()).  Provided init routines don't consume resources, this
will work.
The only remaining problem is that somebody might set the name first
and then decide to abandon the object before calling kobject_init().  
However this probably never happens anywhere.

Are you also going to change all the places in the kernel where the
device name (.bus_id) isn't set until after device_initialize() has
been called?
