Not yet, but that would be a 2 line patch (currently it's hardcoded to
BYTES_PER_WORD align or L1_CACHE_BYTES, depending on the HWCACHE_ALIGN
flag).
But there are 2 other problems:
* kmem_cache_alloc returns one pointer, pci_alloc_consistent 2 pointers:
one dma address, one virtual address.
* The code relies on the virt_to_page() macro.
The second problem is the difficult one, I don't see how I could remove
that dependency without a major overhaul.
