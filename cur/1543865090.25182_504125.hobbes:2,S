OK, here's the more complete scoop - the *out of tree* ieee80211 tree
hasn't been converted, but the *in tree* version has.
Why did I have the out of tree version installed? Because the in-tree
version claimed to be 1.1.3, and the out-of-tree 1.2.16.  Apparently,
the update to the version string for the in-kernel version got blocked
someplace - the in-tree is apparently actually very close to 1.2.16.
