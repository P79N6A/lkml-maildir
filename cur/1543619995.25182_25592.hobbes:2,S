PNPNIOS is right to reserve PNP0C01 as "used". Else there will be hangs
when drivers poke in io space (e.g. laptops tend to have special
hardware which doesn't like to be touched).
PNPBIOS should not reserve 3f0/3f1 as a _workaround_ for this BIOS bug.
The BIOS probably wants to tell you there is a superio chip at 0x3f0
