Yes, please do propose it for 2.6.15 as well.
It is critical in my opinion.  It affects all i386 kernel running AMD Dual-Core processors.  It affects any code that relies on cpu_core_id and phys_proc_id data.
I believe the bug has been around since 2.6.13.  I am surprised no one raised red flags until now.  Maybe everyone using dual core processors migrated to x86_64.  ;-)
Thanks Andi,
