Use single-line printks were possible, or mutex-protected multiline 
blocks where you really can't do without multiple lines of printks that 
really cannot be separated. (Don't perform time consuming functions 
within those mutexes; that would defeat the multithreaded probing...)
To adjust printks is only the beginning of what is to be done to adapt 
single-threaded bus probes to multithreaded ones. There may be hidden 
assumptions that rely on single-threaded execution.
