In this case, it was a pain to just even try to find the call chain, or 
read the asm.
I would encourage lots of kernel hackers to read the assembler code gcc 
generates. I suspect people being aware of code generation issues (and 
writing their code with that in mind) is a *much* bigger performance 
impact than gcc inlining random functions.
So maybe I'm old-fashioned and crazy, but "readability of the asm result" 
actually is a worthwhile goal. Not because we care directly, but because 
I'd like to encourage people to do it, due to the *indirect* benefits.
