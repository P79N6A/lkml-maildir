Right now mpage_redpages does one get_block per extent.  I think it's
pretty messy do do one block allocator call that can return multiple
extents because that leads into a lot of complexity for a rather
questionable gain.(XFS on IRIX does that)

I must admit that standalone code snipplet doesn't really tell me a lot.
Do you mean the possibility to pass around a filesystem-defined structure
to multiple allocator calls?  I'm pretty sure can add that, I though it
would be useful multiple times in the past but always found ways around
it.

Do you mean read_cache_page() or read_cache_pages() ?
(Yeah, it really bad that we have two functions sounding the same but doing
thing quite differently..)
read_cache_pages() could probably be folded into mpages_readpages by allowing
it to give an additional readpage callback similar to how mpage_writepages
can either do real direct to bio or be used as an interator over writepages
calls.
read_cache_page() is quite different from read_cache_pages() and
mpages_readpages in that it is synchronous and waits for the read to complete
before returning.
