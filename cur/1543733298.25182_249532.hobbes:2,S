It is an even more serious problem in my experience. I have been
using sendfile() in my cp command at <

for quite some time, and I quickly decided to send files separated in
some decently sized blocks. Otherwise if a whole file is sent at once
and the source file is e.g. on an uncached floppy disk, cp will become
uninterruptible for about a minute, which is a serious usability flaw.
The user might discover that he is copying the wrong file, or he might
simply change his mind and like to abort the copy or whatever. A
performance gain of only 10 % is neglegible in comparison to this
problem. Thus I think if copyfile() would not be interruptible by SIGINT
and friends, its practical value would be quite limited.
