An additional data point:
I use a Gigabyte BXD board with 2 CPUs, IBM DCAA-34330, IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO,
IDEDMA_PCI_EXPERIMENTAL, PIIX_TUNING.
I've never seens any DMA timeouts, but when I compiled a kernel without SMP
support [thus PIC instead of io apic], I got dma timeout after a few
minutes.
No hardware changes, so memory/disk/cables/... don't explain the timeouts.
