Linus,
I agree that there may be some problem in the code above -- the question is
what has changed to make this behavior emerge?  I see it with a host of 
programs(ssh, make, netscape) -- true all are userspace.  Time permitting, 
I may attempt to track this down in ssh and make in jobserver mode.  It
may be related to some interaction that changed underneath.
