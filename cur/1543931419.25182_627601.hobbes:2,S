Can you specify what sort of permissions you're thinking of providing for
tasks to operate on this class?  Can an object of this class 'operate' on
other objects, or can only process-class objects do that?
How does an object of this class acquire a label?  What is an object of this
class?  Is it a "cache"?  Or were you thinking of a "module"?
