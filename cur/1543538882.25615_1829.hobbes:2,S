We are unlikely to reach that number anytime soon.  Not because we will support
significantly fewer devices, but because your average Linux driver does support
a wide range of devices using similar/same chipsets.
There's *ONE* driver for every 3Com card I use, from my laptop to the office
machines.  ONE driver.  For 10-30 (didn't count) different cards.
And this is not just the 3Com driver, that was just an example.  Pick just
about any driver that's not a driver for some very special kind of device.  All
drivers for ``common'' hardware that I have ever seen, support a very large
number of different (but similar) devices, and those devices do require
different drivers on that other system you mention.
You almost have a point in what you're saying, but the _number_ of drivers
we actually need is at least an order of magnitude lower than on that other
platform.

FSF does hire people, and I've heard rumers that they both eat and need to
pay for food as well.
Ever wondered why the Deluxe Distribution will cost you $5K ?   :)

Drivers are being updated in the stable series all the time.  No problem,
because those are isolated patches.
The problem is interface changes that require an all-driver change.  If such
changes are made a few times every two years in a development series, I fail to
see the problem.  No such change is made for the fun of it.
Anyone who submits a patch that breaks the vast majority of drivers is going to
have a damn good reason,  and if it is indeed such a damn good reason, I fail
to see the problem.   Unlike others, we actually have the source for the
drivers and they can actually be fixed for real, not hooked up to some middle
layer that somewhat fakes the old semantics. Think ``softnet'' then think
``middle layer for old network drivers''.     :)
