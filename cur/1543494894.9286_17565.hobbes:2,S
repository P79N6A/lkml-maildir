I did this very thing using the atomic bit operations to test if the bottom
half needs to be scheduled.  Something like this in your ISR:
	...
	/* Check to see if bh needs to be scheduled */
	if (set_bit(0, &bh_scheduled) == 0) {
		/* clear old struct, fill in fields */
		queue_task( &bh_task, &tq_immediate );
	}
	...
And then in the bottom half, when the work is done I do a
clear_bit(0, &bh_scheduled) to indicate it is safe to re-queue the task.

Right, although you could do it with GFP_ATOMIC, it would be sloppy and
failure-prone.

I tried this method as well, and it works fine too.  But you can avoid the
extra memory consumption and make the routine even faster by not scheduling
the redundant task in the first place.  You also avoid the risk of running
out of the free-list of tq_structs.

Using tq_immediate essentially is a bottom half when IMMEDIATE_BH is used
as your bottom half.
