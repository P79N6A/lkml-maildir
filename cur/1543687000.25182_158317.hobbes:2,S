Maybe I am biased, but I actually prefer to use the C99 size-specific
types, when code will be used outside the kernel tree...  even if that
userland code is entirely Linux-kernel-specific.  I try to avoid "__u<size>"
since it's typically a gcc-specific type.
C99 gave us the tools, we should use them :)
