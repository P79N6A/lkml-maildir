yep, that's the one that looked most suspect to me too so i already 
reverted it in tip/out-of-tree.
But in the normal tip/master test cycle the box takes about 50 minutes to 
build its random kernel and reboot into it (800 MHz P3), so i started a 
full automated bisection instead driven from a faster box.
The bug triggers deterministically so whatever leads to it, we should have 
it within ~20 minutes with a bit of luck (== there's no other bug in the 
bisection run that makes bisection more difficult).
The current bisection state is:
 # bad:  [9a100a44] Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/gi
 # good: [9e42d0cf] Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/gi
 # good: [e441d54d] Btrfs: add permission checks to the ioctls
 # bad:  [cd764695] Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/gi
 # bad:  [a419df8a] Merge branch 'upstream-linus' of git://git.kernel.
 # good: [61bce0f1] pid: generalize task_active_pid_ns
and "871af12: libata: Add 32bit PIO support" is still in the bisection 
window.
