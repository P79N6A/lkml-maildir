According to page 7 of the 
"Serial ATA Advanced Host Controller Interface Revision 1.1"
(available at 
http://www.intel.com/technology/serialata/ahci.htm
), AHCI
supports up to 32 ports.
For example, Silicon Image 3124 also looks good on paper, but only
supports up to 4 ports.

Yeah, I know, but because of their real 'hardware' raid, these cards are
three times more expensive per port. And I just need JBOD.
Thanks for your time. Kind regards, Sander
