The FAT layer asks for a 512 byte block, the scsi layer in 2.2 would then 
reblock the data to handle this internally. In 2.4 the scsi layer errors this
then all the error handling gets tangled up (and doesnt work) and the machine
oopses.
So you either need to teach lots of file systems about handling blocks that
are smaller than the physical layer, or the block layer to do reblocking in
some cases (at an obvious performance hit).
And someone needs to fix the error handling so it errors rather than exploding
