My system has an emu10k1 and a wintv card (Hauppage old) with msp3410
audio decider.  Older kernels seemed to work OK with this combination.
With the latest kernels I never get a /dev/mixer1 entry for the msp3410
device.  tvmixer.o, msp3400.o and the various i2c modules are loaded,
and
the sound seems to be working.
The tvmixer device seems always to be marked (unused) and I have tried
mixer2,3
etc.
