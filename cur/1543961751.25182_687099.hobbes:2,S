That would actually work -- if you use it in a mutex way.  It would then
have slightly sloppier semantics than mutexes -- ie you could unlock from
a different context than the one which locked.  But it would whinge if
you try to use it as a completion.

My current thinking was not to support an equivalent to down(), only to
down_killable().  On further thought, that may not be wise.

I think it's kcounters.  The trick is creating an API that's
lockdep-friendly and works for the users.

Ah, I meant it's a compelling argument for keeping rwsems.
