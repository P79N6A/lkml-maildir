I think you are really blowing the overhead of kernel preemption out of
proportion.  The numbers Marinos J. Yannikos are reported are definitely
a bug, an issue, something that will be fixed.  The numbers everyone
else has historically shown are in line with Andrew: slight changes and
generally a small improvement to kernel compiles, dbench runs, et
cetera.
I also feel you underestimate the improvements kernel preemption gives. 
Yes, the absolute worst case latency probably remains because it tends
to occur under lock (although, it is now easier to pinpoint that latency
and work some magic on the locks).  But the variance of the latency goes
way down, too.  We smooth out the curve.  And these are differences that
matter.
And it can be turned off, so if you don't care about that and are not
debugging atomicity (which preempt is a big help with, right?) then turn
it off.
Oh, and if the PREEMPT=n overhead is really an issue, then I agree that
needs to be fixed :)
