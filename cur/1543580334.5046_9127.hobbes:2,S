Sorry for posting this here, I'm sure you're all busy with 2.4.1 and 2.2.18
but I'm read the SCSI HOWTO and asked on #LinPeople to no avail:
Given two host adapters each with 1 disk of ID 0, how do I tell Linux which
is sda and which sdb?
After this I'll be filling the 2nd SCSI chain completely, so assigning a
different ID is not an option.
Thanks in advance.
