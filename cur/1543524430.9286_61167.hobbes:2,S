I'll answer with a question:
How important can it be, if even its authors or users don't think
it's worth the optimization effort?
This legacy application (before your message, focus was partly on Java
applications, which are not 'legacy', BTW), which has a sub-optimal design,
runs sub-optimally on the current kernel. Its developers don't care
(or have no time to "waste") optimizing it. Should kernel developers do
(or have they time)? Developers time is scarce everywhere...
And for them, Davide kindly provided an useful patch. So if you have to
run that application you have to pay the little price of running a
non vanilla kernel. I don't see nothing wrong with that.
Of course, if after discussing scheduler issues we manage to integrate
Davide's proposal in a way that has no loss for the normal case, we'll
have a better kernel. And we'll thank Davide for starting all this.
