NMIs were disabled. But I've just booted -mm2 and the warning went away.
Could this be related to the recent pda changes?
FWIW, I did the bisection (inserting TRACE_HARDIRQS_ON between
sysenter_past_esp and the cli) and it gave the following result:
In entry.S:
310
311         pushl %eax
312         CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET 4
313         SAVE_ALL
314         GET_THREAD_INFO(%ebp)
315
If I put TRACE_HARDIRQS_ON at line 310, lockdep complains about having
interrupts enabled and being told to re-enable them. If I put
TRACE_HARDIRQS_ON at line 315, lockdep goes back to the original
message.
