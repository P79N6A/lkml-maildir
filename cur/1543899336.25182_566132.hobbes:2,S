"select" is more user friendly while "depends on" makes it easier to 
disable options.
Usually I'm for the usage of "select" in such cases, but since this is 
with CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y where users can be expected to know better what 
they are doing I'd say a "depends on" is fine.
CONFIGFS_FS as a helper for some few file systems is also a different 
situation from SYSFS that is a dependency of much more options.
