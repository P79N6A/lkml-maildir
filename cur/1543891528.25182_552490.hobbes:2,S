This isn't reading the partition table, it's sd trying to determine what 
the size of the disk is. Presumably what's happening there is that card 
reader is not responding as the kernel expects it to. If there's no card 
in the reader, it should be returning an error immediately indicating 
"not ready", but something here causes it to take 12 seconds and then 
fail the command..
