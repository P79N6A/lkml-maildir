Hello.
My kernel 2.6.10 I compiled two times. First with ACPI and second
fully without ACPI. And the same situation.
For me this situation is strange, because usually reset should help,
but not this time. I thought that maybe my BIOS is too old. But with
2.6.9 works. Therefore I don't know. Now I use 2.6.9.
Fryderyk.
