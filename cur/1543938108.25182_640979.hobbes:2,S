Here' s a version with the compares to zero switched to NO_IRQ. If I
understand how NO_IRQ works it is the correct change. My understanding
is that under ppc IRQ zero was legal and NO_IRQ was -1. But then the
whole kernel switched to NO_IRQ = zero. Powerpc updated to NO_IRQ=0
and used virtual IRQs to move a physical IRQ 0 to another IRQ number.
ppc was not changed. This driver does not appear to have been updated
to track this global change since it didn't initially use the NO_IRQ
define everywhere.
