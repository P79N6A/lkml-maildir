Subject: [2.6 patch] remove outdated ext2 help text parts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The patch below solves Bugzilla #3014 by removing much outdated 
information from the ext2 help text.
The help text is now very short, but few correct information is better 
than outdated information - and if you think it's too short, feel free  
to send a patch that adds more current information.

-	  You want to say Y here, unless you intend to use Linux exclusively
-	  from inside a DOS partition using the UMSDOS file system. The
-	  advantage of the latter is that you can get away without
-	  repartitioning your hard drive (which often implies backing
-	  everything up and restoring afterwards); the disadvantage is that
-	  Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and that UMSDOS is somewhat
-	  slower than ext2fs. Even if you want to run Linux in this fashion,
-	  it might be a good idea to have ext2fs around: it enables you to
-	  read more floppy disks and facilitates the transition to a *real*
-	  Linux partition later. Another (rare) case which doesn't require
-	  ext2fs is a diskless Linux box which mounts all files over the
-	  network using NFS (in this case it's sufficient to say Y to "NFS
-	  file system support" below). Saying Y here will enlarge your kernel
-	  by about 44 KB.

-	  The Ext2fs-Undeletion mini-HOWTO, available from
-	  <
http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>,
 gives information about
-	  how to retrieve deleted files on ext2fs file systems.
-
-	  To change the behavior of ext2 file systems, you can use the tune2fs
-	  utility ("man tune2fs"). To modify attributes of files and
-	  directories on ext2 file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").

-	  Ext2fs partitions can be read from within DOS using the ext2tool
-	  command line tool package (available from

ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/ext2/>
) and from
-	  within Windows NT using the ext2nt command line tool package from

ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/dos/>.
  Explore2fs is a
