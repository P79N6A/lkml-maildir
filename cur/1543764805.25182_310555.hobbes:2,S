Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 11, 2005 at 02:20:52AM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

Oh, I wanted to ask about this too. I'd mostly prefer GPLv2 (I have no
problem with the version restriction, I usually do it too), it's the one
I'm mostly familiar with and OSL appears to be incompatible with GPL (at
least FSF says so about OSL1.0), which might create various annoying
issues. I hate when licenses get in my way and prevent me to possibly
include some useful code.

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
