Hi Alan,
no. the stick doesn't have a write protection switch.
Once when i tried to copy a file to the mp3 player i got a new file there on remount,
but it consisted of incorrect data. (so writing seemed to be possible and just went wrong)
(in that case the fat seemed to be damaged after i had tried this, so that windows wasn't 
able to read it correctly any more.
(formatting from the mp3 players menu helped)
greetings
Martin
PS: just as an info - i sent a usbmon trace to Pete Zaitcev today, should I send it to you too?

It sounds as though the device isn't actually carrying out the write 
operations.  Is it write-protected?
