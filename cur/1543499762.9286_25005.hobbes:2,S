Exactly.
Further, with devfs you could pass lookup events for non-existent
inode to devsd, which could then decide what to do. Right now devfs
just passes the event to kmod, which will load a module. If the event
is passed to devsd instead, then devsd could authenticate the module
load request (or do something else entirely, depending on
/etc/devfsd.conf). This works (unlike kmod), because devfs knows who
tried to lookup the inode.

Even better, make arguments against what is actually implemented,
rather than an invented devfs which works in an illogical way. I can't
even imagine implementing a devfs that needs some strange /proc
parsing just to deal with a ZIP drive. It's a really strange idea.
Don't people ever bother to download things and check them out before
criticising? Or is the blindfold only applied to devfs? I'm amazed at
the number of funny ideas that have been raised in this thread, which
are:
- completely unrelated to the devfs I've implemented
- completely unrelated to anything that resembles a halfway logical
  implementation of a devfs.

Phantom bugs, I think.

Even better, you don't need to create nodes because drivers create
usable ones. That's why you can boot a devfs kernel without devfsd.
Nice for an embedded system.

This is a joke. Devfs is a very simple, lightweight and robust
system. Anyone who has looked at it knows that. If you want a
conventional static /dev, then don't use it. If you want a dynamic
/dev (and even some of the most vocal devfs opponents agree that a
dynamic /dev is good), devfs is much more elegant and simpler than any
of the alternative scheme yet proposed. And of course devfs has
features that the other schemes dont'

The only "race" condition with devfs+devfsd was a minor permissions
one, and that was fixed in devfs-patch-v111.
