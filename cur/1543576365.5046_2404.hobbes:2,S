Hello !
New (since test12) optimized memmove function seems to be broken
on alpha platform. 
If dest and src arguments are misaligned, new memmove does wrong things.
example:
       static char p[] = "abcdefghijklmnopkrstuvwxyz01234567890";
       memmove(p + 2, p + 13, 17);
       printk ("DEBUG: memmove test: %s\n", p);
produces:
       DEBUG: memmove test: abyz0123tuvwxyz0123tuvwxyz01234567890
Old memmove variant didn't have this problem.
Thanks,
Alex.
