Hi,
FYI, building the kernel modules with
gcc (GCC) 4.1.3 20070514 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.2-7)
on my powerbook (PPC) gives:
...
fs/udf/balloc.c: In function 'udf_table_new_block':
fs/udf/balloc.c:747: warning: 'goal_eloc.logicalBlockNum' may be used uninitialized in this function
fs/udf/super.c: In function 'udf_fill_super':
fs/udf/super.c:1359: warning: 'ino.partitionReferenceNum' may be used uninitialized in this function
...
If more info is needed, please contact me via PM, as I am not
subscribed.
Thanks for your patience
Elimar
