Oh, there may be lots of reasons. The first one which comes to my mind is
when I archive several config files in a same directory, I rarely think
about adding '-a' to cp to preserve the dates. And when you're experimenting
with a kernel and you're at the 20th at the end of the day, the date in the
config file is often more reliable than yourself to keep track of what you
have tried.
Thanks,
Willy
PS: do you think this could be done easily to 2.4 too ?
