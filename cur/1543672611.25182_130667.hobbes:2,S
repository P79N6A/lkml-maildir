We don't do apm suspend/resume on SMP, so this is no different from the
current situation. I don't know if acpi does it or not.

Where would cpu_resume() [and cpu_suspend()] live?
arch/i386/kernel/suspend* belong to SOFTWARE_SUSPEND, but I don't
think that approach is desirable when apm mostly works for UP.
I could probably get away with simply having apm.c invoke the C code
in suspend.c, which does restore the SYSENTER MSRs. suspend.c itself
doesn't seem to depend on the SOFTWARE_SUSPEND machinery, but
suspend_asm.S does.
Does that sound reasonable?

It does the restore unconditionally, the check is just informational.
