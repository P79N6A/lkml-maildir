Hi,
In the 2.6 kernel configuration, the help texts for all the
IPsec-related options say "Say Y unless you know what you are doing.".
Looks fine for people who applied the IPsec patch to a kernel which
comes without it, but now that it's in stock, it's probably not very
useful to force all users to use IPsec.
Just FYI,
Wilmer van der Gaast.
