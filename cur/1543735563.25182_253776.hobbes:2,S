Subject: [RAID1 Bug] bio too big device md0 (248 > 200) (2.6.9-rc2-mm1)

Hello,
kernel version : 2.6.9-rc2-mm1
i'm using a RAID1 array over 2 disks : one ATA, and another one in 
"SATA" (if we can call the ICH5 a real SATA controller).
During array synchronisation, I get "bio too big device md0 (248 > 200)" 
error, which I fixed in doing
//#define RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE (64*1024)
#define RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE PAGE_SIZE
in raid1.c, following the instruction on an old thread (for kernel 2.6.0).
I would like to know if there is any better fix now, else then this mail 
  will act as a remainder ;)
