Hi,
      1) I want to know what exactly is the structure
of kernel stack. Is it some thing like bss,data,text?
      2) I want to access kernel stack(in kernel
mode). So I am using  kernel stack pointer provided in
thread_struct. So how to access different areas(.i.e 
data,text)  in kernel stack.
       Any pointers will be helpful.
