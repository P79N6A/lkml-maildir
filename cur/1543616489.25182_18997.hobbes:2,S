It's not Linux-specific, but will ALWAYS happen when you use one program
that eats all your input and pipe its output into another program that
waits for your input. 
What and when do you think you will eat when you feed your dog the
sausage you want to eat yourself?

That you're clueless.
You'd do:
X >/my/safe/tmp/dir/X.log 2>&1 & tail -f /my/safe/tmp/dir/X.log

Nope. Non-root user has used setuid application and thus become root.
Drop setuid privileges and use xdm/kdm/gdm if you're to avoid this.

Ping-of-death is a kernel bug or correctness issue or whatever you call
it. This is not. root gave away the privilege to redirect console input
by installing a setuid-application, X, XFree86, Xwrapper, whatever it
may be called.
And now please take this off the list.
