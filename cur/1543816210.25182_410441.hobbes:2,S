These looks OK to me.  Could you regenerate patches against the latest
git (or ALSA CVS) ?
Or, it might be better against to mm tree, since pnp registrations
will be modified there, too.  They should go also to mainstream
together.
Nevertheless, the patches (this and the previous one) are good to go
to stable tree, too.
thanks,
Takashi
