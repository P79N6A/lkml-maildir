Hi
I have written a loadable kernel module for linux-2.4.19-pre10 (PPC). When
I try to do insmod, I am getting the following errors:
unresolved symbol __save_flags_ptr
unresolved symbol xmon
unresolved symbol __restore_flags
unresolved symbol __cli
When I compile the kernel without KMOD and MODEVERSIONS, I am not getting
these errors. There are some other symbols I am exporting from kernel
which seem to be getting resolved fine with and without MODVERSIONS and
KMOD.
I have included <asm/system.h> and <linux/module.h> in my files and I am
compiling the module with -D__KERNEL__ flags.
Any idea why this is happening?
regards
Madhavi.
