Well, I'd say that having to resort to netlink is ... not quite
nice. You get all the complexity of having userspace running during
suspend, and get very little benefit.

Its not only encryption. It is encryption, compression, support for
suspend over network, support for suspend into file. That's quite a
lot of stuff.

...at expense of complexity, and hooks all over the kernel. Yes, if
you modify kernel a bit, nothing will use the page cache.
Anyway, I believe we have solution for that one. See Rafael's recent
patches -- "only free as much memory as neccessary" should do the
trick, without excessive complexity.

Well, I do not want the complexity of two page sets. I think Rafael's
patches will provide almost equivalent functionality. Other than that,
all your features should be doable. I'm not saying I'm going to write
those patches myself, but I'll certainly not reject them just because
they are too big.
