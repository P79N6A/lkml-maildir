Good work, Ingo.
I have not received first mail with announcement yet, so I will place 
my thoughts here if you do not mind.
First one is per-thread data like TID. What about TLS related kernel
data (is non-exec stack property stored in TLS block or in kernel)?
Should it be copied with regs too (or better introduce new clone flag,
which would force that info copy)?
Btw, does SSE?/MMX?/call-it-yourself really saved on context switch?
As far as I can see no syscalls (and kernel at all) use that registers.
Another one is more global AIO question - while this approach IMHO
outperforms micro-thread design (Zach and Linus created really good
starting points, but they too have fundamental limiting factor), it
still has a problem - syscall blocks and the same thread thus is not
allowed to continue execution and fill the pipe - so what if system
issues thousands of requests and there are only tens of working thread
at most. What Tux did, as far as I recall, (and some other similar 
state machines do :) was to break blocking syscall issues and return
to the next execution entity (next syslet or atom). Is it possible to
extend exactly this state machine and interface to allow that (so that
some other state machine implementations would not continue its life :)?
