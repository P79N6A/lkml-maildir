Hi Pavel,
Thanks a lot for doing it! I'll test it this week. However, I think
eventually the LED fix and the freefall infrastructure should be two
different patches. Also, while adding the freefall support, you should
add the info in the doc, as well as the little C program demonstrating
its use.
See you,
Eric
