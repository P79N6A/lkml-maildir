There are some strange things in there.
choice values can also be tristate symbols, so you wouldn't need the
separate defines, unless you really always want to compile only a single
controller (even as module).
The "default m if USB_GADGET = m" looks weird, if I understand them
correctly this should just be "depends on USB_GADGET", e.g.
config USB_NET2280
	tristate
	depends on USB_GADGET
	default USB_GADGET_NET2280
this would also fix the menu structure and the drivers menu would appear
below the gadget option.
I'm also not sure about USB_PXA2XX_SMALL, as it also can be written as:
config USB_PXA2XX_SMALL
	depends on USB_PXA2XX = y
	default USB_ZERO = y || USB_ETH = y || USB_G_SERIAL
is this really intended?
The dependency "USB_DUMMY_HCD || USB_NET2280 || USB_PXA2XX || USB_SA1100
|| USB_GOKU" can be basically reduced to "USB_GADGET".

I can't reproduce this, it works fine here.
