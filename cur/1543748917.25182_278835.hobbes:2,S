Do you mean that with GFP_KERNEL we may still deadlock on line 199 of
the snippet below (from mm/mempool.c)?  That alloc pointer points to
mempool_alloc_slab, which gets called with __GFP_WAIT turned off.  The
kmem_cache allocator doesn't get called with the allocation priority
we specify in our make_request_fn, so we won't block there.
   190	void * mempool_alloc(mempool_t *pool, int gfp_mask)
   191	{
   192		void *element;
   193		unsigned long flags;
   194		DEFINE_WAIT(wait);
   195		int gfp_nowait = gfp_mask & ~(__GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO);
   196	
   197		might_sleep_if(gfp_mask & __GFP_WAIT);
   198	repeat_alloc:
   199		element = pool->alloc(gfp_nowait|__GFP_NOWARN, pool->pool_data);
   200		if (likely(element != NULL))
   201			return element;
   202	
If we block later on the pool, that's because there are 16 objects in
use, which means that mempool_free is going to get called 16 times as
I/O completes, so I/O is throttled and forward progress is guaranteed.
Otherwise, how does the mempool mechanism help in preventing deadlock?
It looks like we can simply change GFP_KERNEL to GFP_IO in our
make_request_fn, but I'd also like to understand why that's necessary
when there's a dedicated pre-allocated pool per aoe device.
