Ok, I grabbed those and I have both good and bad news.
The good news is that I no longer get just a black screen at boot.
The bad news is that it still doesn't work quite right.
No matter what mode I try to boot in I always get the same, and it's as if
the image is drawn only on every second scanline. One result of this is
that I can only visually see approximately the top half of what I'm
supposed to see - like, if I type in something in the shell, then I have
to press enter several times untill enough lines have passed for the text
to reach the top of the screen and thus is actually visible.  Another
result of this is ofcourse that what I /can/ see doesn't look very good.
Also, after starting X (using the "nv" driver, not a fb X server) - if I
switch back to a text console then the screen is completely garbled - I
can switch back to X just fine though.

PS. I initially tried applying your patch to 2.6.1-rc1-mm2 , it had a few
rejects, but I tried building it anyway - it wouldn't compile. So I went
back to a clean 2.6.0 to which the patch applied flawlessly.
