My earlier reply to this missed the mark a little.
Instead what I would say is this.  If one wants to move a CPU from one
cpuset to another, where these two cpusets are not in the same
partitioned scheduler domain, then one first has to collapse the
scheduler domain partitions so that both cpusets _are_ in the same
partitioned scheduler domain.  Then one can move the CPU between the two
cpusets, and reestablish the more fine grained partitioned scheduler
domain structure that isolates these two cpusets into different
partitioned scheduler domains.
