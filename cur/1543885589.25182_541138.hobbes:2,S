Actually, this is a non-issue.  The reason that it is handled for extent-only
is that this is the only way to allocate space in the filesystem without
doing the explicit zeroing.  For other filesystems (including ext3 and
ext4 with block-mapped files) the filesystem should return an error (e.g.
-EOPNOTSUPP) and glibc will do manual zero-filling of the file in userspace.
Cheers, Andreas
