Many networked filesystems end up doing most of the _real_ permissions
checking at IO time, not opens. That said, "open()" should return
definitive errors as early as possible, but sometimes you really have the
case that the real error only happens when you try to read or write
something.
Not saying that smbfs is right, just explaining that it _might_ be right. 
Urban, did you see the thread?
