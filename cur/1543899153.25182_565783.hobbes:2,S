Hi,
The following two patches:
* add a feature allowing the user to make the system beep during a resume from
  RAM on i386 and x86_64 (useful for users with broken resume, so that they can
  check if the control reaches the kernel after a wake-up event)
* integrate the new feature with the existing acpi_sleep flags
* fix acpi_sleep_setup so that the order of parameters in the command line does
  not matter.
Greetings,
Rafael
