This method is very similar to the djprobe.
And I had gotten the same idea to support preemptive kernel.

This means the below code, doesn't this?

	jmp 1f /* short jump consumes 2 bytes */
	nop
	nop
	nop

I think the djprobe can provide most of functionalities which
your idea requires.
I'll update the djprobe against for 2.6.17 or later as soon as
possible. Would you try to use it?
