Chapter 10 speaks about that alread?
                Chapter 10: Configuration-files
For configuration options (arch/xxx/Kconfig, and all the Kconfig
files),
somewhat different indentation is used.
Help text is indented with 2 spaces.
if CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
        tristate CONFIG_BOOM
        default n
        help
          Apply nitroglycerine inside the keyboard (DANGEROUS)
        bool CONFIG_CHEER
        depends on CONFIG_BOOM
        default y
        help
          Output nice messages when you explode

Ok.
