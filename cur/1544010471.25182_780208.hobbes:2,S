FWIW all issues are still there with kernel-2.6.27.7-134.fc10.i686
and xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-61.fc10.i386.
Anyway I got a bit impatient by a lack of follow-up on this and resumed
the "rebuild radeon-gem-cs bisectability" operation (luckily the problem
was narrowed down to the second part of changes so I didn't have to do
100% of the work)...
Hangs seem to be caused by commit 5c5736604e6a1bc280821bd92f3714e0c9e7d7d3
("radeon: no need for this anymore"):

I'm now running Fedora's xorg-x11-drv-ati with only the above patch reverted
and so far it is rock stable.
Thanks,
