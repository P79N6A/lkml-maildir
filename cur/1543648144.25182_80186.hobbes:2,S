doesn't sound good, ...
as i said, i don't have any problems (= failures, data loss, etc.) with this driver, 
sounds like i should update to a newer driver version, wich qlogic 2x00 driver 
version do you recommend ?   or does this affect all versions of this driver ?
(performance on the machines i use is quite good, a dbench 256 gave me
approx. 60 mb/s (ibm xseries 342, 1x pentium 3 - 1,2 ghz, 512 - 1024 mb ram))
arjan, thanks for the info, i didn't notice that the driver was that bad,
i had much to do in the past months, so i possibly missed disscussions
about the qlogic2x00 stuff, sorry,
simon.
