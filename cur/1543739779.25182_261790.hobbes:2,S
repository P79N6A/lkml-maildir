i'll do x64 a couple of days after stability has been reached. I dont
know of any ARM efforts though.
a good starting point would be to enhance the generic-hardirqs framework
for ARM. Generic-hardirqs is a portion of the PREEMPT_REALTIME patch
that i've split out and submitted upstream, and which is expected to be
merged into 2.6.10. The generic irq subsystem makes the irq-threading
feature really simple and maintainable. So for PREEMPT_REALTIME to work
on ARM the first step is to enable generic-hardirqs on ARM. (which is
far from simple though.)
