But it is N^2... I thought SGI of all would hesitate to put such an
algorithm into the scheduler ;)

Maybe you misunderstood, I'll explain below.

You keep track of a fallback CPU. Then, if balancing fails because all
processes are pinned, you just try pulling from the fallback CPU. If
that fails, set the fallback to the next CPU.
OTOH that still results in suboptimal scheduler, and now that I remember
your workload, you had a small number of CPUs screwing up balancing for
a big system. Hmm... so this may be not great for you.

I'd like to get an ack from Ingo, but otherwise OK I guess.

Hmm, how about
1. Export SD information in /sys/
2. Export runqueue load information there too
3. One attribute in /sys/.../CPUn/ will be written to a CPU number m and
   a count t, which will try to pull t tasks from CPUm to CPUn
4. Another attribute would be the result of the last balance attempt
   (eg. 'all pinned').
