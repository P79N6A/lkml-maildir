No-one is saying that this driver should not be mainlined before it  
has LE support. All that I said was:

The alternative would be to explicitly state in Kconfig that LE arm  
is broken with this driver, so that this could be fixed later.
Please can we not blow this out of proportion, it really isn't that  
big a deal. The irony is that fixing Krzysztof's driver to work on LE  
will probably be quite easy, given that we already have a working LE  
driver from Christian.

PS: It really isn't just 'a few folks' - at NSLU2-Linux we have 5000  
people who have downloaded Debian/LE for NSLU2 and are currently  
using Christian's driver with great success. We would just like to  
replicate that support with this new driver.
