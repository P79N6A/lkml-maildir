This one I second wholeheartedly.  Because its entirely possible that my 
isp's server will not retry, but will probably spend the next 3 days 
emailing me failure notices every 3 hours or so.  They also have their 
own blacklist for incoming that I've had to bitch about, at length 
because the only way to get around it is to change my email address to a 
special one they maintain.   Theres only one fly in that solution that 
makes the soup unpalatable, I can't send using that address in my headers 
as its an unknown user error to their outgoing.verizon.net servers .  I'm 
on vz, go figure.
My first reply since, so this is a test of sorts.
