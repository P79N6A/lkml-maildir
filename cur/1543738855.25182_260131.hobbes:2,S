The patch is entirely bogus. This isn't at all ia64-specific, and
doesn't live in arch/ia64. It's just as applicable on _all_ systems
where we may want to do CPU or OS emulation.
If you make it generic so that qemu can use it for emulating i386 even
on machines like ppc64, perhaps it would be saner.
