I thought the way to use the *_nested() calls was "consistently"!
That is, if one instance of a lock access uses it, they all should,
since that's the only way lockdep learns about equivalence classes.
Also, locks shouldn't move between those equivalence classes... so
the raw lockdep data stays correct.
The IRQ framework uses spin_lock_irq() in only one place that I saw:
in kernel/irq/autoprobe.c for the probe_irq_{on,off,mask}() calls.
Those calls will grab locks at their "top level", and then the
irqchip methods they call might need to grab locks for other irqs.
Potential example:  chip->startup() and chip->shutdown() could
need to ensure a *parent* controller starts/stops, and that should
involve mutual exclusion using the parent's irq lock (as well as
the child's).  So the chip and its parent should be in different
lock classes, else lockdep will wrongly warn of recursion.

That's not how the autoprobe() stuff works.  The other calls in
the genirq framework don't use the *_irq() variants though, so
your intuition is right there.  (Only the autoprobe paths had
the FIXME comments in that patch I sent earlier, related to the
lack of the $SUBJECT primitive.)

The probe_irq_*() calls are made from task context, not hardirq
context, but they access the same locks involved in IRQ management
and processing.  So either they need to pass the same lock class
annodations to lockdep, or there's something that's unusually
counter-intuitive going on with respect to those annotations in
simple tree data structures.
