hi,
X Window System has many problems affecting directly
the kernel.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System#Limitations_and_criticisms_of_X
-Many current implementations of X manipulate the
video hardware directly.
-X deliberately contains no specification as to user
interface or most inter-application communication.
-The X protocol provides no facilities for handling
sound,
-Until recently, X did not include a good solution to
print screen-displays. 
-One cannot currently detach an X client or session
from one server and reattach it to another.
I would add :
-X needs to be root so it opens many security holes.
-X has more code than the kernel and it is almost an
OS in itself.
-if a "closed-source" graphical card driver has
security holes, what do you do ?
etc.
Some people are working on replacement like Y windows
:
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/teaching/projects/Distinguished03/MarkThomas.pdf
http://www.y-windows.org/
There are some questions like :
- should the next generation window versions Y,Z etc.
remain backward compatible with X ?
I think they should start something better and simpler
from scratch and not backward compatible.
- should the kernel remain pure "shell" or include
some basic universal graphical universal window system
?
I think second answer.
Regards.
