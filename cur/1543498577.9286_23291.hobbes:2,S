After recompiling with the above patch everything works perfect now,
hope it continues that way.  I had problems with tulip 21142/3 and cisco
cat2926 with 2.2.5 but know works fine too. This machine is runnig squid
with 16Gb of cache on a 24Mbs line I'd tried to put 1/3 of our load and
it seems to be able to handel it, tomorrow I'll do more performance
tests.If someone is interested or has any suggestions let me know.
Thanks 
Flavio
