Look back in the archives for my messages on this.  Basically, trying
to use the pata_hpt37x driver on an Rocket133 card (HPT302 Rev 1 chip)
fails with a bunch of errors shown below.  This is a PCI add-on card
with /home and /local filesystems on there, mirrored across a pair of
120gb WD drives.  The system also has a pair of builtin SCSI
controllers (AIC7xxx) which hold the OS filesystems, as well as a tape
drive for backups.  It's an SMP system.  I guess I should try to boot
it up UP and see how it goes then as well.
I've tried booting 2.6.18-rc4-mm3 with the irqpoll option, but it
didn't make a difference.  
Do you need more details?
  irq 18: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
