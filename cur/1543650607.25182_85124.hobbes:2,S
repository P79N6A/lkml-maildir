> EXT3 Htree support.

I ran this (tune2fs -O dir_index /dev/hdXXX).
After a bit of switching back and forth between 2.4.19 and 2.5.44,
fsck was run while booting 2.4.19 (the usual check because of >30
mounts).  There was a message about optimizing directories.  Booting
continued but (big surprise) X refused to run.  It turned out that some
device files had vanished.  Very strange.  On rebooting, fsck found a
gazillion bad inodes.  They all turned out to be from the 2.5.44 tree -
poetic justice I suppose!  But this did not suffice.  Rebooting, I got
"optimizing directories" again.  Next fsck showed up more dud inodes.
After a few cycles of this, I ran
tune2fs -O ^dir_index /dev/hdXXX
to remove htree support.  No problems since then.
Duncan.
PS: UP, no preempt.
