Further, if you monitor the /proc/tty/driver/serial character counts with
small enough resolution, I guess you could learn the delays between
individual key presses when the user enters his password. This can be used
to further aid the brute force attack (delays between different key pairs
have different average delays statistically, just as different characters
have different frequencies in a given language. I think there is a paper on
this, and someone suggested an attack like this for snooping ssh
passwords.)
