Unfortunately I don't have the money to go and buy a dumb-terminal, and
the nearest other computer is ~30 feet away.  I've actually looked into
writing code that allows to kernel to return to VGA-text mode for this
reason.

I actually already run klogd with -x due to earlier threads on lkml, so
it can't be that /particular/ problem, but klog/syslog may still be to
blame.  I'm usually lucky to get anything in my log between "--MARK--"
then "klogd restart" related to the crash.
