Looks fine. Your "please pull" message hass some slight stylistic 
problems, but the pull looks good, and matches what you claimed for it.
The stylistic problems are:
 - please write the git repo address and branch name on alone the same 
   line so that I can't even by mistake pull from the wrong branch, and so
   that a triple-click just selects the whole thing. 
   So the proper format is something along the lines of:
	"Please pull from
		git://jdelvare.pck.nerim.net/jdelvare-2.6 i2c-for-linus
	 to get these changes:"
   so that I don't have to hunt-and-peck for the address and inevitably 
   get it wrong (actually, I've only gotten it wrong a few times, and 
   checking against the diffstat tells me when I get it wrong, but I'm 
   just a lot more comfortable when I don't have to "look for" the right 
   thing to pull, and double-check that I have the right branch-name)
 - your diffstat was fine, but was line-wrapped for some reason, which 
   just makes it harder for me to line up and compare against what I 
   actually got when pulling (ie I just have two xterms open, one with 
   the mail-reader, one with my shell command line, and I visually compare 
   what I get with what I _should_ get, and then something as silly as 
   incorrectly wrapped lines just makes the thing look visually different, 
   which again just throws me for all the wrong reasons).
But everything looks fine apart from those trivial details. Pulled and 
pushed out,
		Linus
