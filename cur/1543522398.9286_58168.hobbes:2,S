The ideal thing would be to check /usr in the background, possibly after
the rest of the boot process has finished.  (Or using low priority
requested, on-off throttling etc.)
And you certainly don't want to be checking /home in the background at
the same time as /usr if they're on the same disk.
Does the check really buy anything or is it ok to turn it off?
