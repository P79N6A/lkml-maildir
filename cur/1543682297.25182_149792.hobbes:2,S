Why, write a small program 'passfd /var/run/socket fd1 fd2' which
does the work for you.

You can get the uid/gid on the other side of a unix socket easily,
so you just setfsuid() / open(). But again you do need to use
a Unix socket, not a pipe, so you need a small client program.
There have been patches to the kernel to treat an open() on a
unix socket as a bind() + connect(), but unfortunately that has
never been integrated in mainline.
Now that we have getsockopt(SO_PEERCRED, &ucred) the above would
be very useful.
