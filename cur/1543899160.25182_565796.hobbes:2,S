It loads it itself, using some external software!

It should either print:
	no stage 1 firmware found!
or
	found stage 1 firmware <name>
Does it really print neither?  If so, that must mean that the
firmware loader got stuck.

You need to write the file that was asked for: the modem starts by asking
for the first file, uploads it, then asks for the second file and uploads it.
The file is written to the "data" file, but note that the data file is created
on the fly when the modem requests a firmware load so you can't write to it
at some random time.
Ciao,
Duncan.
