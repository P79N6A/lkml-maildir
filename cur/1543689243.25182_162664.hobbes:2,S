Actually: the VM_SHARED flag will never change, so testing VM_SHARED is 
actually the _right_ thing from a mm perspective.
The only person who should ever test VM_MAYSHARE is somebody who does
reporting back to user space: VM_MAYSHARE basically ends up meaning "the
user _asked_ for a shared mapping". While "VM_SHARED" means "this mapping
can actually contain a shared dirty page".
The VM itself should only ever care about VM_SHARED. Because that's the 
only bit that has real semantic meaning.
