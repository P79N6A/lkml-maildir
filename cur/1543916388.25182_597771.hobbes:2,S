i spoke too soon.  The Gbit interface still dies.  Lasted around 
19hrs. or so.  i can't tell if there are hardware issues: yesterday 
a Gbit NIC on the firewall died.  Different chip (Realtek), 
different driver, different machine, same segment.  Segment is a 
mix of 100Mbit and 1Gbit machines.
Symptoms of the failure are it just stops functioning with no error 
messages.  ifconfig says there are packets being TX'd and none 
being RX'd.  Interface can't be brought up again.
i use this box as the secondary DNS for our Internet domains 
(unblocked by firewall), as well as the database server for our 
developmental web CMS and the LAN ntp server (both services 
invisible outside the LAN).
dmesg says this on bootup:
> ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:01:00.0[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 16

Motherboard manufacturer identifies the chips as:

board is DFI LANPARTY UT CFX3200-DR/G running an Opteron 165.
i've brought up the other Gbit network interface on the motherboard 
and am using that.
