This is true if SMIs are still flowing, and the SMI handler correctly handles
the reset properly. I have seen cases where the SMI handler is broken which
causes the system to perpetually hang. Utilizing the exposed reset mechanism
in ACPI should reset the system every time. However, if the reset fails it
will fall back to the keyboard controller.
