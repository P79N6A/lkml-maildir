strace always became the parent or it won't get the SIGCHLD from the task
when it gets stopped (after the SIGCHLD strace wakeups and looks at the
syscall param or at the syscall retval depending if it's an entry or exit
kernel).
Nevertheless I agree that probably the wu-ftpd different behaviour may be
made more close to reality ;). OTOH additional PF_PTRACE* special cases
are not very nice...
