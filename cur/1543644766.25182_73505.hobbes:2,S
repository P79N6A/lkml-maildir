At a minimum, fix this to:
 - not print out that stupid "kernel" thing. Of _course_ it is the kernel. 
   Modules can put their module name to clarify, but the core kernel 
   certainly doesn't "clarify" anything by putting "kernel" there.
 - print out offset/length like the user-space ksymoops does. Without the 
   offset the thing is useless, since you still need the real address to 
   actually look up which instruction faulted.
