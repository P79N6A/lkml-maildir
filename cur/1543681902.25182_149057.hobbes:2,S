Hi
My HP ZE 5170 laptop has RH9 with gcc
gcc (GCC) 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5)
grub.conf reads 
title Red Hat Linux (2.6.0-test1-ac1)
        root (hd0,5)
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.0-test1-ac1 ro
root=LABEL=/ hdc=ide-scsi idebus=66
        initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.0-test1-ac1.img
title Red Hat Linux (2.4.20-18.9)
        root (hd0,5)
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.20-18.9 ro
root=/dev/hda6 hdc=ide-scsi idebus=66
        initrd /boot/initrd-2.4.20-18.9.img
title Debian
        root (hd0,3)
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-bf2.4
root=/dev/hda4 hdc=ide-scsi idebus=66
I compiled the source for 2.6 test after applying the
second patch and then 
make mrproper
make xconfig 
make bzImage 
make modules 
make modules_install 
make install
copied the .config to the appropriate file in /boot
The message upon bootup is
mounting root filesystem
mount error 19 mounting ext3
pivotroot: pivot_root (/sysroot, /sysroot/initrd)
failed:2
umount /initrd/proc failed : 2
Freeing unused kernel memory : 228K freed
Kernel panic : No init found 
Try passing init= option to kernel
I did include ext3 fs support because it was already
part of old config file from 2.4 which was used as a
base for the new config file. 
I don't think this should make a difference but ....
Under 2.4 I had made the change that I had made
separate reiserfs partitions for /usr /var /tmp after
the initial install and moved all the relevant files
there. / is still ext3. the 2.6 source is under
/usr/src. 
The strange thing is I pass exactly the same options
to the 2.4 kernel as well as kernel 2.4.18-bf2.4 (
debian on reiserfs ) and there isn't any problem.
Should I be trying some debugging? I am not very sure
how to go about that.
Thanks in advance.
