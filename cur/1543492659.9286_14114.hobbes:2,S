Has anyone out there ever done a low level format using the generic scsi
drivers.  Why I ask is when I do it the write sends out the command to
the drive, a Zip drive in this case, and the drive goes off and happily
starts to do the low level format but it comes back too soon.  It then
does the read but there is a sense error. The sense error I get is
Medium Error,  Not ready to ready transition ( medium may have
changed).  I know the commands I send to the drive are correct, in fact
I have looked them up in the Zip specs. 
Could there be some type of signal that is causing the low-level
formatting to be ending to soon, or is there some signal I should send
between the write and the read in the scsi call?
I am at a loss.
Susan
