Your compiler being? I for one wouldn't trust others, C++ is still very
much in flux in gcc...

The kernel is OO in design, just not written in C++. And as I said before,
you either redesign Linux from the ground up for C++'s idea of OO, or use
wrappers and pay the cost in bloat and performance. Neither is acceptable...
maybe for a specific case, but not for general use.

Gripe #1 is complete nonsense (not _that_ thread again...), gripe #2 is
mostly nonsense (sure, Linux could still have the internal interfaces from
1.0, but the cost would be prohibitive for an OS that wants high
performance on machines that are at least an order of magnitude larger than
they were then).
And for whatever #2 is worth, you are only making it _harder_ for yourself
to track the changes by plastering something over the interface.

I'd be a bit more careful. It is in large part those "completely
ridiculous, nobody will ever be able to write decent software that way"
whims that got Linux to where it stands today.
