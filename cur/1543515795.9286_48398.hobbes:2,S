Hi,
Documentation/vm/locking says that to scan vmlist we can either
use mmap_sem or vmlist_access_lock but both of these are process context
specific. What if I want to scan vmlist regardless of any process, e.g. if
I want to create segments in ELF /proc/kcore based on vmlist elements but
want to make sure that nobody changes the list while I traverse it.
I could go through the process table and do vmlist_access_lock() on
everybody's mm but surely there must be a better way...
Regards,
Tigran.
