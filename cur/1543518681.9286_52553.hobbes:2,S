I think there are plenty of clients that will generate traffic regardless
of what the X server is up to. (Glances at window manager's menues) The
following seem like likely candidates:
	xbiff, xclock, netscape viewing any sort of dynamic page,
	xterms which have active programs running in them, xlock,
	xearth, xload

The same would happen if any client tries to talk to the X server in that
time.

You don't have to turn it on, it's switchable. I have 60 Xterms here,
none of which suspend - your situation may be different.
