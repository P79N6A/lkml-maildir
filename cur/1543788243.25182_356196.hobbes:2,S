Well, color me confused.
You appear to be saying that the permission on a file differ depending
on which link you are accessing it by. Furthermore, your stance seems to
imply that linking to a file grants either write permission or ownership
on the new link.
So, under this permission model, I could link to /etc/passwd in my
home directory, edit the link to change my UID to zero, then relogin to
the system as an administrator.
Not that I would need to, of course, because any user who owns/could
write to a directory would be able to alter any file on the entire
system. I know they're called "permission" models, but that seems
*extremely* permissive...
