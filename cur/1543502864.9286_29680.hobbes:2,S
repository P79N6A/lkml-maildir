  X11 display freezes when writing a particular audio CD.
  (and the CD led goes from flashing red to flashing green)
  I have burned about 10 disks on this setup.  Then I tried to write
 a particular set of .wav files, and the system hung (apparantly)
 on each of three tries.  I can still sucessfully burn a different
 set of .wav files.   I still have the offending .wav's on hard disk.
 If someone can suggest a good experiment, I will perform it.
 (eg, if I try it, and switch to the first VC, is there a chance
  I will get an oops report ?)
 I searched the system log files, but found no information. Examining
 two CDs shows that different amounts of data (about 1/2) had been
written at the time of the crash.  (After this, I started writing in
dummy mode.)
  warning.  It may be a hardware problem. After the first crash I noticed
that the CPU fan was dead.  I installed a new one. Didn't fix the  problem.
Although the CPU may be damaged, everything else seems normal. I doubt the 
CPU is damaged.  Maybe compiling a kernel would be a good test.  I have
another CPU that I can try as well.
  This is an AMD K6-I 200MHz .
