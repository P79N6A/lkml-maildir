Btw, I'd really love to hear whether the patch I sent out actually _helps_ 
at all, or whether we're just discussing something that in the end is just 
a cleanup..
Martin, Peter, Andrei, pls give it a try. (Martin and Andrei may be 
talking about different bugs, so _both_ of your experiences definitely 
matter here).
