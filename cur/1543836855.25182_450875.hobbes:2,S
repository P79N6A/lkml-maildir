Subject: [PATCH] megaraid: Use the proper type to hold the irq number.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/7/158

When testing on a Unisys machine it was discovered that
the megaraid driver would not initialize as it was
requesting irq 162 instead of irq 1442 it was assigned.
The problem was the irq number had been truncated by being
stored in an unsigned char.
This patches fixes that problem and the driver now appears
to work.
The ioctl interface appears fundamentally broken as it exports
the irq number to user space in an unsigned char.
