pathconf() and fpathconf() are the obvious POSIXy interfaces for it.
Other possibilities are getxattr(), lgetxattr() and fgetxattr().
The only thing I don't like is that some cacheing algorithms will need
to make 2 system calls for each file being checked, instead of 1.  I
see no way around that, though.  At least the attribute approach would
allow all three (different) delta values to be read in one call (listxattr).
Is there a de facto standard interface used by another OS for this?

I didn't know that, thanks.

Nice!
