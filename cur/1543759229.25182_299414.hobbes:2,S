You are hitting the point. We release the darn things. 2.6.11 is
released and it is not stable enough, because it had not enough test
coverage.

Yes this should be the meaning of -rc. But in reality it is not. And
thats the damned reason why people are ignoring -rc releases.

And they are smart enough to know that -rc3 is a complete different
beast as -rc1 and not a stabilized version of -rc1.

We are talking about how to convince more people to test -rc kernels in
order to have a stable release version. Those who are testing current -
rc kernels are not enough people to give this a good coverage.

Ack. Changing only the names is nonsense. You have to change the way it
works. Jeff pointed out correctly that this is also a human
communication problem. We have managed to scare people off testing -rc
kernels. So we end up with a release 2.6.X where people actually start
testing and complaining. Now we want to maintain a 2.6.X.Y tree which
fixes those problems. Thats plain wrong IMNSHO, because it moves out the
-rc phase to a 2.6.X.Y tree without real target. Linus called it sneaky
and thats what it is. A sneaky gimmick. People will debunk this.
We have different goals to achieve:
- Stable kernel releases
- Broad testing coverage of -rc versions
- Ongoing stable development
- Bleeding edge development
This is nothing new. Thats a _normal_ workflow in projects whether OSS
or commercial.

This is a clear seperation and solves several problems
- Linus must not do the boring real -rc steps
- -rc versions are likely to get good testing coverage
- Release versions will be stable
- Development is continous
- Release cycles will be more frequently

Yes thats the point. He has learnt that and therefor he is ignoring
_all_ -rc versions.
