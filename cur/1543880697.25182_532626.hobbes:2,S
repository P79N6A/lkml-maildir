The critical size window is relatively small, though.  The size of the 
uncompressed kernel mod 4 MB must be above 3.75 MB or so.  If you have 
less than 1 GB RAM, the window is even smaller.  This is strictly 
configuration-dependent, and has nothing to do with Xen.  It just so 
happened that the first people to detect and diagnose it (as opposed to 
just "it doesn't boot") were Xen people.
