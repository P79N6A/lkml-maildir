It's still there, but they say not to enable it...
There was a memory leak in the segmap and the only way pages would get freed
was by the scanner waking up (in the manner explained earlier). richard
mcdougald wrote an article about this called the paging storm.
They implemented a new system that still tends to give preference to
filesystem pages called a cyclical page cache. I haven't seen any
whitepapers on how it works though.
I wouldn't call it embarrasing though, they still recommend that you always
run it on pre-Solaris 8 systems because it tends to improve performance by
quite a bit on systems where there is lot's of filesystem I/O.

AFAIK they quietly removed priority paging from Solaris 8,
somewhat embarrasing considering the publicity at its
introduction with Solaris 7, but no more embarrasing than
the regular VM rewrites Linux undergoes ;/
Now only if VM was a well-understood area and we could just
implement something known to work ... OTOH, that would take
away all the fun ;)
cheers,
Rik
