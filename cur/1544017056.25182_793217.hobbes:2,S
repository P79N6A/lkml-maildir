Don't confuse plugging and merging, although one does help the other.
We can essentially divide the current SSD market into two categories -
queuing and non-queuing. Which also happens to just about the same as
saying Intel and non-Intel, at least that has been the case since Sep
'08 and until present time. On the queuing devices, plugging does more
harm than good. The IO access time is so fast, that delaying for merging
hurts your performance.
For non-queuing devices, I think our current check is a bit too drastic.
We probably want to change that to
int dont_plug(q)
{
        return blk_queue_nonrot(q) && blk_queue_tagged(q);
}
Which is identical to what CFQ tests for idling to avoid read/write
overlaps which also completely kills performance on the current SSD
drives (except for Intel, which again shines).
