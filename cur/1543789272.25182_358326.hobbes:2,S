So ugly...
But, it's the best fix for now.
Longer term we might want to make an asm/cpumask.h that can
help allow the platforms to cleanly say "well, mask X is
equivalent to Y, so only instantiate X and define Y to X"
which is all that these two platforms are trying to accomplish.
If you don't support cpu hotplug, present == possible afterall.
