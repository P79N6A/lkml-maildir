What is the recommended amount of swap with the 2.4.x kernels?
The standard rule is usually memory x 2.  (But that is more a Solaris
superstition than anything else.)
Is it the same or "as much as I can get away with" or something else?
I am asking because I have just ordered a new drive for my Vaio (8.1 gig
in a 8.45mm drive!) and I want to install 2.4.x on it.  (I like getting
the swap partition done right the first time. Repartitions are a pain.
Especially if you screw up.)
