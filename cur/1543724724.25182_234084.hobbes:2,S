On a single setup.  What about people that want to use Linux on a 128way with
over a terabyte of memory.  Certainly ORDER 14 might be to small for them.

Only if I use the cmdline option.  With no command line arguments this allocate
the kernels sain calculated defaults.

It seems easier to specify a the number of buckets you want than specifying a 
scaling factor, which some people may have problems figuring out.
