Subject: [PATCH 7/9] PCI PM: handle PMCSR more carefully
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/5/48

This patch changes __pci_set_power_state() such that it only modifies
the power state byte in PMCSR.   Otherwise a PME event might
accidentally be cleared (when entering a state greater than D0), or
PME_En might be cleared (when returning to D0) despite the device driver
intending to leave it enabled in D0.
