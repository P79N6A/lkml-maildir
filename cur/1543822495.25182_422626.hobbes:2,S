If the parallel interface is directly exposed as a PCI device
and it supports the typical 8255 programming model, it should
just work if you add the appropriate vendor and device IDs to
parport_pc_pci_tbl[].
The serial driver has a default case that claims any device that
PCI_CLASS_COMMUNICATION_SERIAL class code.  In theory, the parport
driver could claim anything with PCI_CLASS_COMMUNICATION_PARALLEL.
In that case, you wouldn't even need to modify anything.  But
maybe there are issues that prevent parport_pc.c from doing this.
