Well, it is about the same size as my .config...
I agree we are unlikely to hit it any time soon... I could imagine
some (ab)uses, like fixed_acpi_bios=<lots of hex digits>, but those
are ugly. I could also imagine some uses where entire embedded machine
is described at kernel commandline.
Yes, all those are ugly/unlikely. OTOH saving 2 bytes does not seem
like that great goal.
