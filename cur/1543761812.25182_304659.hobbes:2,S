   Great, Russell. Now we understand each other.
   Actually some chip manufacturers are responsible for this mess. Some do
NOT burn a modem class flag in the hardware, others do.
   Is it nonsense to imagine that the part of 8250_pci which handles modem
class become a loadable module?
   We could then load the "linmodem" driver first, which would not disturb
use of true modems.
   My suggestion is very likely going to reveal the depth of my ignorance
about kernel architecture, I guess.
                                             Jacques
