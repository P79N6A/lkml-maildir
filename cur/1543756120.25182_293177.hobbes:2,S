Why compete with vaporware (mostly)? If you really want to see a 
complete
modern graphics system, check out OS X.  See the below screenshots for
one example.

The rendered window from 2k4 has been distorted by the windowing system
post-processing using a mesh transform.  It runs just as quickly this
way as it does full screen normally, at least as far as I can tell
while playing. :-D A truely well-performing graphics system should be
able to handle multiple applications processing to generate a single
output stream without effort.  I also ran some informal and simple
end-user-style tests a while back where I rapidly switched between and
moved around the following windows (each distorted in the same way):
	1)	A UT2k4 window playing a demo
	2)	A couple translucent terminal windows continuously scrolling
		text
	3)	A DVD player window playing The Matrix
	4)	A couple Quicktime player windows with movies running
The best part was: ~60 FPS on everything, despite the distortions,
translucency, rapid movement, DVD playing, etc.  I hope that when the
new linux graphics and Soft-RT stuff is done it will be able to achieve
similar performance. If my coding skills were a little more up to
snuff, I would try to help out, but as it is, I fear I'd just muddy
the waters :-\.
Cheers,
