64-bit CONFIG_NO_HZ is a new feature in v2.6.24. If it happens on 32-bit 
too and it didnt happen in v2.6.23 32-bit then it's a regression.
all this comes from blktrace's original decision of using sched_clock()
:-) It's not a global timesource and it's not trivial to turn it into a
halfways usable global timesource.
