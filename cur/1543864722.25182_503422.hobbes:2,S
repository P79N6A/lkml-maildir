How is that clear?  As noted in the specific examples I provided, that 
is how a large number of popular drivers and subsystems have been developed.

It's a good thing we've delivered on this, throughout Linux's history, then.

The only difference between Greg's offer and offers made by other 
developers to vendors is that his was public on LKML, and the subject 
line concluded with an exclamation point.
I tell hardware vendors the same thing all the time -- just get the 
specs to me or another capable developer, and we'll work with you to get 
Linux support going.
So far, we have ATA, USB, ethernet, audio, and several other positive 
examples of this working in the real world.  And your counter-examples? 
  Ancient ISA drivers.
