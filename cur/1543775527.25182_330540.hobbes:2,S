Hi Greg,
I was wondering why we need dynamic id support in the driver core.  Is there
an issue where the bind/unbind mechanism requires this feature?  I was hoping
bind/unbind would replace it.
I understand that there are PCI drivers that use .driver_data and read from
their ID table (e.g. pci_serial), but we don't really want the user modifying
these IDs because they're often attached to some device specific tables.
It was my understanding that the *probe function should be responsible for
accepting any device, and then gracefully fail if it knows it will be unable
to support it.  For some drivers this could include failing if it's missing
from the ID table.  If the driver developer requires the driver to match to
an unknown pool of devices, then the *probe function could be made more
advanced.
Thanks,
Adam
