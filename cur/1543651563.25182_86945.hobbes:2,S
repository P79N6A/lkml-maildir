Hi all,
I'm trying to re-create a RAID while leaving the other RAIDs -- 
including the root filesystem -- running, but mkraid refuses to run:
hera 1 # mkraid /dev/md2
/dev/md0: array is active -- run raidstop first.
mkraid: aborted.
(In addition to the above messages, see the syslog and /proc/mdstat as well
  for potential clues.)
hera 2 # cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [linear] [raid0] [raid1] [raid5] [multipath]
read_ahead 1024 sectors
md1 : active raid5 sdf2[5] sdc2[4] sde2[2] sdd2[3] sdb2[1] sda2[0]
       50339328 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 0 [4/4] [UUUU]
md0 : active raid5 sdf3[5] sdc3[4] sde3[2] sdd3[3] sdb3[1] sda3[0]
       298881024 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 0 [4/4] [UUUU]
unused devices: <none>
(And no, there is no overlap between them.)
Anyone know how to work around this problem?  This is using 
raidtools-1.00.2-1.3 from RedHat, which seems to be just 
raidtools-1.00.2.tar.gz.
(Also note: the raid directory on kernel.org seems to be abandoned. 
Unless someone speaks up I'm going to remove it.)
