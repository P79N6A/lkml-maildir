Good points,  I prefer to see IB as replacement for
SCSI, FibreChannel, IDE, with its RDMA, messaging and
reliable connection, user mode DMA type features.   They
are type of connections without the congestion avoidance
issues associate with TCP design - the "no network layer"
type of works.
I don't know if IB over multi-nodes/multi-hops in a WAN like
setup works or not.  I like to see network experts like 
yourself try to break that since all the congestion control which
is "supposely" done in HW as compare to doing that in software as 
in TCP/IP.  It would be nice to know how solid is the overall 
IB congestion control design in that environment and at 
what point does it break.   
IP over IB is a bit like IP over SCSI or IP over FibreChannel
for me.
