Just because you are using a Linksys/Netgear or god else knows what to
mangle your packets and call that device a router does not mean that normal
service providers have NAT enabled on their GSRs and Junipers.
The issue is not in a router running IOS somewhere. The issue is in the
broken code/broken driver/broken something on the end-point.
