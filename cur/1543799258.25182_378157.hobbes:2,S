You have:
server 127.127.1.0     # local clock
fudge  127.127.1.0 stratum 10
in your ntp.conf, right?  I bet if you comment out those two lines ntp
will start behaving.
(I had to comment them out long ago, and I have been lead to believe that
it is wrong to include them in a configuration which is only supposed to
synchronnise to external time sources.)
