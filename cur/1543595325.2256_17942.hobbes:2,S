Can't run that, but : 
grep "partition_name" System.map-2.4.5-ac12 
00000000c014cba0 t partition_name
00000000c01aad00 T partition_name

Only the raid5 was active, the msdos stuff is a module for 'just in
case'.  Something else triggered this, I've run raid for a long time
without problems.

Hmm, I would have thought that /proc was more up to date, because it
would reflect changes.  No reboot, never even considered it (I've
rescued too many junior sysadmins that think rebooting is _the_ answer).
