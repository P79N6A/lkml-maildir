Hi,
while trying to compile a non-modular 2.5.14-dj2 kernel I got the
following ALSA-related .text.exit errors at the final linking:
<--  snip  -->
...
sound/sound.o: In function `snd_card_es968_probe':
sound/sound.o(.text.init+0x22222): undefined reference to `local symbols
in discarded section .text.exit'
sound/sound.o: In function `alsa_rme9652_mem_init':
sound/sound.o(.text.init+0x2b78a): undefined reference to `local symbols
in discarded section .text.exit'
sound/sound.o(.data+0x36fd4): undefined reference to `local symbols in
discarded section .text.exit'
...
<--  snip  -->
The problems are
In sound/isa/sb/es968.c:
snd_card_es968_probe isn't __exit (more exactly it's __init) but it calls
snd_card_es968_free that is __exit
In sound/pci/rme9652/rme9652_mem.c:
alsa_rme9652_mem_init isn't __exit (more exactly it's __init) but it calls
rme9652_free_buffers that is __exit
I'm not sure whether removing the __exit is the right solution or whether
there's a better solution.
