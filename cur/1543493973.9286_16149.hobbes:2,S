I know. As first due an e2fs bug. There's also some other performance
issue in some not normal condition (i.e. cp /dev/zero /tmp/zero) due
too heavy try_to_free_buffers() writeahead loop (probably this is present 
in 2.2.6_andrea2 as well though).

This made me to think that you did something wrong. Here is definitely
stable from an Oops point of view. You can show me your .config though.
