Depends on your hardware configuration and how you stress your system with
db workload, you should consider some performance patch from the linux
scalability effort project.

I can't speak for -aa, but I can say definitively, DO NOT stay with the
"stock" kernel for oracle applications.  We're using -rmap here (mostly 9i
with some 8 scattered around) and performance under moderate and heavy
load is an order of magnitude better.
