There is no use in running your code. It does not decipher any block
without the proper key. Where is the exploit? 
Further the link you provide in the posting above is broken (as you
already noticed). I tried at google cache, citeseer and the rest of
Saarien's homepage. No success. 
If you have any idea where I can obtain the paper, I'd be interested in
seeing the references for your claims.. But guessing from the apparent
logic of your code, it seems to be identical to the weakness brought
forward in the following paragraph of my original posting, which you've
cut out of the quoting.

Actually there is a version: util-linux 2.12 official. But
unfortunately, the official version truncates binary keys (at 0x00, 0x0a
values), that's what my patch is for. cryptsetup handles keys the same
way. So migration is easy, something which does not hold true for your
strange util-linux patches. But you already know my critiques..
