OK
BTW, -mm3 works fine for me on two AMD64 boxes except for one thing:
On Asus L5D, if I resume the box from disk on battery power (ie the box is started
on battery power and resumes from disk), it hangs solid right after copying
the image (100% of the time).  If it is resumed on AC power, everything is fine.
Well, -mm1[1-2] did the same thing so I think I'll create a Bugzilla entry and
start a binary search. :-(  The -git[5-9] kernels are not affected by this issue.
Greets,
Rafael
PS
Could you please tell me how I can figure out the order in which the individual
patches in -mm have been applied?
