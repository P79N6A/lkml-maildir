You are distorting what I said.  The "resume upon open and suspend upon
close" scheme was not intended for things like input devices, which are
more or less permanently open.  It was intended for things like
fingerprint readers or printers, which spend most of their time not being
used.

The most obvious model for suspending keyboards or mice is an inactivity 
timeout (with the timeout limit set from userspace), but other policies 
certainly could be useful in specific circumstances.
Considering that we have virtually no autosuspend capability now, taking
the first few simple steps will be a big help.  Just getting an
infrastructure in place is a good start, even without a userspace API.  
Later on, when we have a better idea of what we want, bells and whistles
can be added.
Even Oliver has admitted that the implementation issues are very tricky 
and he doesn't know the best approach to take.
