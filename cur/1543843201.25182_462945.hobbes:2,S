Well, given that you can't represent a log of a negative number, I'm not sure
it matters.
Note that long_log2() already exists and is of arch-dependent size.

I then end up with 32 of these per usage if I pass in a definite 32-bit value:
	warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
because of the:
		n >= (1ULL << 63) ? 63 :	\
		n >= (1ULL << 62) ? 62 :	\
		n >= (1ULL << 61) ? 61 :	\
	...
in ll_log2().
