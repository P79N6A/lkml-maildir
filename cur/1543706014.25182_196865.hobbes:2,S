Erm...  You know, it would be much better to do that _before_ sysfs-related
merge.  With framebuffer_release() being originally defined as kfree(),
so that no breakage would happen during the transition.  Once everything is
using dynamic allocation with framebuffer_alloc()/framebuffer_free(), add
sysfs bits.  That way you get the same total size of patches in the series
and avoid the breakage on intermediate stages...
