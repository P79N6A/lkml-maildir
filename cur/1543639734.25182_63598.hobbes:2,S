I've seen these sort of symptoms before and it turned out
to be faulty memory. 
Back in 2.2 I had a box which picked the behavior up if
you did a ifconfig down/ifconfig up after it had been running
for some time.
tcpdump on the localbox it that case showed Ok (outgoing) packets, but 
another box on the same network segment showed the same packets as
corrupted.
Changing the RAM cured it completely.
