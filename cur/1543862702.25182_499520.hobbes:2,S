Good.  :)

Thing is, it's not OK to break other subsystems like that.

The disk scheduler queue is more complex, as I understand things,
since it can combine operations.  For USB, "combining" would break
essential semantics relied on by both sides of the transaction.
Maybe the best way to view this is to accept that with USB, all
scheduler operations (e.g. for bandwidth reservation management)
are out of scope of the AIO request model.  AIO requests are no
more (or less) than "append this to the endpoint's I/O queue",
with the (host side) I/O scheduling handled separately.

Sounds more complex, but it would be nice to have that code become
zero-copy instead of single-copy.  That'd let some platforms work
with high bandwidth ISO from userspace, which previously would not
have had enough CPU bandwidth.  ("High bandwidth" means sustained
8-24 MByte/sec data streaming.  Processing pixels at that rate may
require a companion DSP...)  Testing will be different issue though.
