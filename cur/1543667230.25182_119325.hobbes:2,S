There is no bk export text file, the output of the export is the CVS
repository, there isn't anything else.  Everything that we could 
extract has been extracted and put in CVS.  It's a fairly complete
and accurate extraction, too.  Far more than the traditional releases
and pre-releases, I don't know how many of those there have been in
the 2.5 timeframe but I can't imagine more than a couple hundred;
there are 8500 commits in the 2.5 CVS tree.
