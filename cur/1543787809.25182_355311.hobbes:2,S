That is exactly my point that the kernel should not limit itself on only
using contiguous buffers. Every USB controller can handle discrete DMA
buffer why shouldn't the kernel? Obviously it should be nice to address
the contiguous buffer restriction before bump up the bulk transfer limit.

The current usbdevfs does a extra copy between from the user space urb
to the kernel space urb. So it does not matter if the user space urb is
contiguous or not. If the kernel can handle discrete dma internally,
the usbdevfs could use it and maintain it's current API.
BTW, That is not VMware choice how the data buffer was arranged. It is the guest.

I still think fixing the kernel to allow address scatter-getter buffer and
allow bigger buffer size is the right thing to do.
