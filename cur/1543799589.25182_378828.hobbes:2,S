I know that!
And I am aware of the (Linux implementation) implications...
I don't think you read my question in deep...
I offer a provider (Shared library), and I must deal with 
this edge condition where the main program setuid.
In Linux every thread is a process so only the main thread 
is setuided.
I need to catch this even in my shared library and setuid my 
threads as well, since Linux pthreads implementation does 
not take care of this.
Since I am not writing the main program and since I cannot 
force the main programmer to behave any differently, I must 
handle this internally.
Do you know a way to be notified when the process setuid?
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev.
