No, the future option looks fine. I suspect that when you go for a real 
integrated database, you'll automatically get all the features I like.

The thing is, I think that the "work area" really is overrated.
There's no reason to have a work area at all if you just had:
 - read-only filesystem for grep/make (autogenerated)
 - separate commands for editing
I don't find it depressing at all to have to use "bk editor" to edit a
file. I just aliased that one, and I'm all done. That's why I don't think
that the filesystem interface should have revisions or writeability: once
you get into those things, the filesystem abstractions simply aren't valid
any more.
But reading the current contents (as opposed to reading some revision) of 
the thing _is_ a perfectly valid thing to do, where the FS interfaces do 
actually map perfectly.

That's better. It doesn't fix the pipe example, though. You're missing the 
-l option to grep etc..
