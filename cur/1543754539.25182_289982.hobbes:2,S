Hi everyone.
SoftwareSuspend 2.1.5.7B for the 2.4.28 kernel is now available from
softwaresuspend.berlios.de.
Bug fixes and forward ports to 2.4.29 and later kernels notwithstanding,
it is intended to be the last release of SoftwareSuspend for the 2.4
series kernels.
The 2.4 version of Suspend is generally pretty easily to get going, but
if you have any questions or problems, you will find lots of resources
at softwaresuspend.berlios.de. In particular, there are HOWTOs, FAQs,
and a Wiki that you can consult before asking on the mailing lists
you'll also find there.
Fuller instructions regarding applying the package can be found in the
README file, included in the package.
Nigel
