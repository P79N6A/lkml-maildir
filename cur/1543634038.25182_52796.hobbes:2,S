Subject: [off topic - RFC] APM suspend + hdparam

Hello there, 
I've been playing around with hdparam. 
With one of these parameter, one can enjoy the __silence__ stolen by his/her  
beloved computer :( 
 -y   put IDE drive in standby mode 
 -Y   put IDE drive to sleep 
e.g. 
hdparm -Y /dev/hda  
(assume you have only one hard disk, and your linux is there) 
But... 
As soon as the kernel accesses the hard disk (bflush? kswapd? etc.), gone is  
the __silence__ :( 
So I tried this: 
apm -s & hdparm -Y /dev/hda & 
 
sometime it works, sometime not. I know that "software suspend" is on the  
way, but till denn, this might be easier to "fix". 
 
 
Idea: 
        One can __FREEZE__ the kernel, put IDE drive to sleep and then __sus 
pend__ the system, just like "apm -s" does. 
        If the system wakes up again, waits till IDE is waken up (or maybe le 
ts the kernel wakes it up), and just continue to work as normal, stealin 
g your __silence__ again. 
 
Requirement: 
        APM must work ;).  
        ACPI never tested before. 
 
Purpose: 
        To have ONE BIG BUTTON(TM) that give you a break!  
        and just like magic, on an instant your are back on work again!  
        If you lose your power during this suspend,  
        then may the penguin be with you ;) 
 
I would like to call this feature HOT SUSPEND(TM) :) 
 
Best regards, 
Soewono Effendi

        if you try these experiments :)
