There appear to be a variety of platform problems that lead to trouble 
with libata (and also with the IDE driver to some extent), with the 
default x86-64 kernel + some buggy BIOSes + some iommu weirdness.
Here are some boot options to mix and match:
	nomce, iommu=off, noapic, acpi=off
And also try using an SMP kernel (CONFIG_SMP) rather than a uniprocessor 
one.
