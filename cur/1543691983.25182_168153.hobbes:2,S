2.6.0-test3 compiled with gcc-3.3.1 and redhat 7.2's
gcc-2.96-112.  gcc-3.3.1 saves about 275k text (10%).
-Os is more effective on gcc-3.3.1 than 2.96.
These were all built with the same .config.

Most frequently saved instruction with gcc-3.3.1 -Os is nop.
This was on x86.  The -falign=2 version had -falign-functions=2
-falign-jumps=2 -falign-labels=2 -falign-loops=2.  I believe the
default with -Os is no alignment (i.e. -falign-*=0).
I benchmarked those compilers/options on a K6/2.  You could wade
through 
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/bigbox.html
to see all the results.  
Quick summary:
gcc-3.3.1 -Os -falign=2 was best for most LMbench tests.  
For other benchmarks that wasn't always true.  K6/2 has small
L1 cache (32+32K)  L2 cache is 1M, but not much faster than RAM
on my box.
These generalizations can be made:
1) gcc-3.3.1 -Os kernel code is about 10% smaller than gcc-2.96 -Os.
2) Actual memory savings is not 10%, because dynamic structure
   sizes don't change.
3) gcc-3.3.1 takes significantly longer to compile source.
YMMV
