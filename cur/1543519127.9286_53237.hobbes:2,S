It has not been "abandoned", it has note been updated to changed internal
interfaces yet. And "initrd doesn't compile with the latest development
kernels" is _far_ from "Latest kernels don't compile at all. Distributions
have secret kernel sources they won't share, just to screw the Linux
community".

If you need a production kernel, stick to 2.2.x, at most check out Alan
Cox' 2.2.14pre series. Or stay with the (patched) source from your
distribution. Or, if you are looking forward, experiment a bit with 2.3.x
to see what 2.4 has in store.
