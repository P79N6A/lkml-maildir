The thing I had horrible problems with in CVS was when the "vendor" branch
was actually two branches (e.g. 2.2.x and 2.3.x), *and* I wanted to keep
local code as well. At least, I think this was the problem I was banging my
head against, it's been a while since I used it[0]. In the absence of BK, and
if you can live without client/server mode and live with a few
Lisp/Emacs-isms, I can recommend PRCS.. "It just seems to make more sense" :-)
[0] I think I wrote some scripts and a text file to document the problem I
had. I can dig them out if anyone's interested.
