Subject: [PATCH] slub: don't confuse ctor and dtor
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/15/227

kmem_cache_create() was swapping ctor and dtor in calling find_mergeable():
though it caused no bug, and probably never would, even if destructors are
retained; but fix it so as not to generate anxiety ;)
