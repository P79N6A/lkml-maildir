ok, just loaded 2.4.1 again with Maciej's patch. works fine but here too
-- flood ping kills the ethernet stuff in a few seconds. in fact, within
approx 800 interrupts. the god news is that teh system stays alive, just
as with Alan's -ac1 version.
ok, here is the list
2.4.0 stock	floodping received	crash
2.4.1 stock                             crash
2.4.1 + patch	ok, but ethernet dies
2.4.1-ac1       same
