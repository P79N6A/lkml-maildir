But I think that there are plenty of light terminals still booting like
this which will not be able to upgrade anymore then. Even right here,
my web server (parisc) boot from the network that way. At least an
initramfs would need to be able to cope with the same syntax, otherwise
we might break some systems where it's not even easy to change those
info in the boot loader.
