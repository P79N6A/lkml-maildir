Unless you make your new system compatible with X, then all X
applications must be rewritten.

So if I get a new video card I have to get a new kernel?  Why can't I
just get an updated display system if my kernel works just fine.  RIght
now I can boot any VGA compatible card (and many others) to text mode
and work on my system, while I figure out how to get X going on my new
card.  If it was all in the kernel I am screwed if the kernel doesn't
yet support doing graphics on my new card.  I know that problem from
using Windows, although at least it eventually got better at falling
back to VGA only mode if it couldn't work with a new card.
