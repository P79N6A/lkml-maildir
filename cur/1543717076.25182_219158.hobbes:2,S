Subject: Synaptics touchpad jumpy under 2.6.2+

The Synaptics touchpad on my Asus M5N laptop is jumpy (sampling ~3 times
per second or less) under Linux 2.6.2, but it works fine under 2.6.1.  I
have also tried 2.6.5, and the problem persists.  In all cases, the
kernels are straight from kernel.org with no extra patches.
The kernel identifies my touchpad like so:
   Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
    Firmware: 5.9
    Sensor: 17
    new absolute packet format
    Touchpad has extended capability bits
    -> multifinger detection
    -> palm detection
   input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
The problem shows up in both gpm (1.19.6) and XFree86 (4.3.0.1 with the
Synaptics driver 0.13.0).  It even shows up if I 'cat /dev/input/event0',
which produces 3-4 events per second under 2.6.2 and 75-80 events per
second under 2.6.1.
The touchpad problems seem to "spill over" to the keyboard.  When I touch
the touchpad at all, the keyboard becomes unresponsive for a second or
two.  If I don't use the touchpad, the keyboard is fine.
The keyboard and touchpad are both built in, i8042 devices.
I tried adding 'i8042.nomux' to the kernel command line.  It didn't make a
difference for me.
I #define'd DEBUG in i8042.c.  Here's the resulting dmesg:

Does anyone have any suggestions?  Any idea what changed in 2.6.2 that
disagrees with my touchpad?
