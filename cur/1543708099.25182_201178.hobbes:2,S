Although I still don't think, this is relevant (because scripts for
interpreters having these problems don't have to pass multiple arguments
on the shebang line), I just tested some example scripts like this:
  ----
#!/bin/zsh -v -x
echo "argv0: $0"
/foo/bar
  ----
(the last line to get an error message).
Everything works as expected using those shells:
  ksh:      PD KSH v5.2.14
  GNU bash: 2.05b
  ash:      0.2
  zsh:      4.1.1
  tcsh:     6.12.00
I could have a look at the sources, but as this is the behaviour the man
pages and susv3 describe, this should be "evidence" enough(?).
