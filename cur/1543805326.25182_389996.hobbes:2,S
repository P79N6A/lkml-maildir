free_irq()'s /proc fiddling has always been a pain - we just shouldn't be
doing filesystem things in irq/bh context.

It's not a very big bug - I think only Steve hit it, and that with a
stress-test which was somewhat tuned to hit it.
So we can afford to sit on the problem for a while, as long as someone is
working on a broader /proc-sanity fix.  But nobody will do that.
I wonder if we can just punt the unregister_handler_proc/kfree up to a
keventd callback.
