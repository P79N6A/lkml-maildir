please just add a current->put_vcpu() function pointer instead of this 
hooks thing.

ok, this looks certainly cheap enough from a scheduler POV, and it 
cleans up the whole KVM/scheduling interaction quite nicely. (I'd not 
bother with tweaking the migration logic, there's enough incentive for 
the scheduler to keep tasks from migrating unnecessarily.)
