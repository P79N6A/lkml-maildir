I'm in favor of choice.  And it's no doubt that users appreciate the
intuitiveness of pathname based security.  The real question is the
actual security of the system.  What we don't want is a choice that
embodies any false sense of security.  So that is why it's important to
understand how AppArmor protects from the pathname based attacks.
