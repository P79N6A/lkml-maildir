There's actually three different cases of interest on ARM:
1. direct-mapped and vmalloc()ed kernel memory
2. coherent DMA memory
3. I/O memory (device mappings)
smp_*() only make sense on (1).  Here, you'd want a hardware barrier
on SMP systems, and just a compiler barrier on UP systems.
For (2), most ARM systems use uncached mappings of kernel memory, which
are strongly ordered, and you don't need hardware barriers.  However,
some ARM systems are cache coherent, and they can use ordinary mappings
for (2) (i.e. kmalloc), _but_, such ordinary mappings are weakly ordered,
and so on those systems, you _would_ need hardware barriers for (2).
For (3), Device memory (i.e. I/O mappings) are strongly ordered on all
ARM platforms.
(And of course, then there's the synchronisation issues _between_ the
different mapping types.)
Anyway, we could split the barrier types into three groups, or even
more groups (I bet that on, say, ia64, there's at least a couple more
different scenarios of interest), however, I'm really worried that the
Average Joe Driver Writer's head is just going to explode.

Not (anymore) on ARM:

The question is whether this change was correct.

There's two different statements that can be made about mb():
1. You shouldn't use mb() to synchronise with other CPUs as that is
   unnecessarily slow.
2. You must not use mb() to synchronise with other CPUs as that is
   wrong.
Which is it, (1) or (2)?  The memory-barriers.txt document confuses
these two issues, and you confuse these two issues, but there is a
_fundamental_ _semantic_ _difference_ between these two statements.
Let's not confuse them.

OK.  Can we clarify the docs on this point, please?

I was not making any statement, I was just giving two possible
interpretations of the above-quoted snippet from memory-barriers.txt.
Yes, I'm aware of the issues you mention, and yes, all the other
necessary guarantees are provided on the ARM platform.

Again, I was not trying to make a statement here, just giving a
possible interpretation of a statement in memory-barriers.txt.

Sounds OK to me.  Then again, I have an idea of what all the different
types of barriers do.. Joe Driver Writer might not.

Bah.  Until the docs are changed to be utterly and unambiguously
clear on this point, that's just rubbish.
