The garbage collection is what's horrible about it :)
Btw, 15 would be exceeded easily in my home directory.
IMHO, an inode whose block pointers points to another, so that whole
files only can be shared, would be fine.
Only one level of indirection would be allowed, so there'd be no
loops, just reference counted shared inodes.

ps. Sharing individual data blocks is rather complicated.  If it were
a very desirable feature, I'd be inclined to go for reference counted
shared extents or reference counted shared indirection blocks
(i.e. sharing at the level or 4Mb or whatever the first indirection
block size is).
