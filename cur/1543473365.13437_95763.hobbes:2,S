Hi there.

The longest uptime I'm aware of is for a system that was running
kernel 2.0.7 and was continuously up from 3 Aug 1996 until it was
upgraded to kernel 2.0.36 on 1 Dec 1998. That's better than 2 years of
uptime...
The system had been serving solely as a router, but was upgraded so it
could additionally serve as a firewall and webserver... 
Best wishes from Riley.
