There was some discussion about whether this was correct or not in this 
thread:
http://groups.google.ca/group/fa.linux.kernel/browse_thread/thread/d5b5905d7f1aa221/66c41ee3a26583b3
Did this ever get resolved? From my reading of the N60 erratum, 
disabling the 12.5% duty cycle sounds like this should be enough, 
disabling everything under 2GHz is not necessary..
