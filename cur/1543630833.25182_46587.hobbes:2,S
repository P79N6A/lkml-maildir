Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.15-gregkh-1  (USB stuff)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There have been a lot of different USB patches that have gone into my
tree since 2.5.15 came out, so here's a big patch with all of them for
people to play with, and resync against.  Of special note is that there
is now 4 different drivers for the UHCI controller, and I have disabled
support for the usb-ohci.o driver in the Config.in file (use ohci-hcd.o
instead.)
I will be removing 3 of the UHCI drivers soon, but will post more about
that later, after 2.5.16 appears (hopefully with all of these changes.)
It's available at:
