Nick's worst case scenario is already at least partially addressed by the 
Lumpy Reclaim code in 2.6.23. His examples assume 2.6.22 or earlier 
code.
The advantages of this approach over Andreas is basically that the 4k 
filesystems still can be used as is. 4k is useful for binaries and for 
text processing like used for compiles. Large Page sizes are useful for 
file systems that contain large datasets (scientific data, multimedia 
stuff, databases) for applications that depend on high I/O throughput.
