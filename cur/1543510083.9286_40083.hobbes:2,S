Argh things are going crazy again, but differently. I have 30
"possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies" in my kernel log, and
now Apache is refusing connections (connection reset by peer) after 5
minutes of uptime. A stop/start also fix the problem. netstat does not
show anything unsual (~1200 open connections). Anything I can do ?
Thanks for your help.
