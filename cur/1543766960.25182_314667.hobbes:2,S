Oh, yes, I agree, but I don't want libpci to contain too much arch
specific code, so we must may sure that libpci has the mean of "knowing"
how to deal with that. When you mmap "resource0", you can't know that
there is an alignement/offset issue and that what you'll be getting is
actually not pointing to your actual resource but somewhere ... below.
In order to know that, libpci need to know the actual physical pointer
that was used by the kernel for the mmap before the page alignment so it
can figure out what offset to apply. So that is why I'm saying that
whatever we expose in "resources" and/or "/proc/bus/pci/devices" should
at be a CPU physical address, or at least contain the low PAGE_SHIFT
bits of it... even if the rest is a token...

Oh, not only that ... also playing ping pong when several cards are
there, tracking who is having the ownership, but also allowing the
driver who can disable legacy decodign on the card to inform the arbiter
so that card stop beeing bothered and can keep interrupts enabled at all
time without bothering etc.. etc.. etc.. that includes fixing the kernel
vga console to deal with an arbiter, some fbdev stuffs as well, and
more.. an finally adapting userland things like X to use it.
The actual arbiter core itself is easy. Making things play nice with it
is the difficult part. I'll come up with various solutions that I wnat
to experience with before KS/DS and will present my results there so we
can decide what to do.

It is, and the X.org people do agree, provided there is no loss in
functionality.

Hrm... do we have to worry about somebody in userland mmap'ing it's
register via /sys/*pci and breaking because of that ? :) I have a real
net big performance improvement on X by doing that trick ... the sysfs
mmap API doesn't really provide a mean to do it explicitely from
userland (unlike the ioctl with the old proc api)

Well, I'm still trying to find a case that would break. I'm not doing
that for in-kernel mapping. Oh well, it's done anyway, I'll see what
reports I'm getting from it...

I know. I just don't see how to replace it with sysfs ... maybe mmap
pgprot flags...
