ugh? What i did was something even better: i merged your patches myself 
(with some caveats, which i pointed out). That's something that people 
consider as a "cool, you just saved me some work!" moment, not a "hey, 
dont you dare forcing MY patches into your tree" incident ;-) At least 
that's how 99.9% of the people on lkml typically see it.
You really need to take a vacation ASAP! =B-)
