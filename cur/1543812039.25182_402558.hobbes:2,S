Verified.
Also ...
  1) As stated before, this is -only- with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK and
     CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP enabled.  If I turn these two off,
     it boots fine.
  2) Because the patch:
	gregkh-driver-put_device-might_sleep.patch
     that comes just before here was causing me to worry with its
     added error messages, I removed it from my stack.  That made
     no difference to the failing boot (it simply removed the
     error messages, as Greg would predict.)
