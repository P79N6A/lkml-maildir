I've advocated several times having a single config option for "fine
tuning" that sane people say "N" to and which if set lets you force
small hash sizes, disable block layer support and kill various other
'always needed' PC crap. Tell me - on a 4Mb embedded 386 running your
toaster do you really care if the TCP hash lookup is a little slower
than perfect scaling, and do you need a 64Kbyte mount hash ?
