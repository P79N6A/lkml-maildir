The ia64 audit bit is likely my fault from the audit header detangle.
I did try w/ and w/out CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL set, but only on one arch.
I also did a grep, but was only looking at audit_putname/getname, and
missed the others.  I just did a more complete grep of the symbols that
can get config'd away (including CONFIG_AUDIT as well), and I think
there's a few more missing pieces.  Sorry about that.  Jeff, Ralf,
Martin, these look ok?
thanks,

A closer sweep of configurable audit symbols shows the following need
audit.h included when audit.h is detangled from fs.h as in -mm.
	arch/um/kernel/ptrace.c    for audit_syscall_entry/exit
	arch/s390/kernel/ptrace.c  for audit_syscall_entry/exit
	arch/mips/kernel/ptrace.c  for audit_syscall_entry/exit
