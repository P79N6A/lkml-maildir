It's not literally a bug in libc -- the C standard says it's
implementation-defined whether malloc(0) returns NULL or a cookie -- but
it is definitely a bug (in a portable program) to depend on either
behavior from libc.  See ISO/IEC 9899:1999 7.20.3 paragraph 1.

This paragraph is nonsensical, because realloc(malloc(0), 10) is
allowed, regardless of whether malloc(0) returns NULL or a cookie.
realloc(NULL, n) is allowed, and defined to be identical to malloc(n).
7.20.3.4 paragraph 3.
Geez, why does a trivial post about a bug in some program have to turn
into a pile of misleading statements and citations to ISO documents?
