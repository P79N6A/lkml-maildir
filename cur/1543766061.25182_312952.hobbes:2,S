  Well, the thing is that we don't really care what exactly happens to 
the queue or how the queue is plugged or not.  All we need to do are to 
requeue the request and kick the queue in the ass.  Hmmm, maybe I should 
keep the comment about how the request will be put at the head of the 
queue, but the second part about plugging doesn't really belong here, I 
think.

  Yes, that will be more efficient but I don't think it would make any 
noticeable difference.  IMO, universally using scsi_run_queue() to kick 
scsi request queues is better than mixing blk_run_queue() and 
scsi_run_queue() for probably unnoticeable optimization.  If we start to 
mix'em, we need to rationalize why specific one is chosen in specific 
places and that's just unnecessary.
  Thanks.
