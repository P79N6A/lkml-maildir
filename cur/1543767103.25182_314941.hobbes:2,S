This trade-off FAILS, as my benchmarks against Mercurial have shown.
It trades 10x disk space for maybe 10% performance relative to my
approach. Meanwhile, it makes a bunch of other things hard, namely the
ones I've listed. Yes, you can hack around them, but the back end will
still be bloated.

Mercurial is even younger (Linus had a few days' head start, not to
mention a bunch of help), and it is already as fast as git, relatively
easy to use, much simpler, and much more space and bandwidth
efficient.
