You might be able to steal a couple of bytes and then rewrite ext2fs
to mask those out from the 'i_generation' field, but it would mean that
you could no longer boot your old 2.2.16 kernel without trouble on
existing clients.
I'm no expert on the consequences of such a change on ext2fs and what
it might do to other OSes, but my gut feeling is that this is perhaps
one solution that we should try to avoid.
