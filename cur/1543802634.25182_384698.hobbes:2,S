Simply block sigchld like this:
	sigemptyset(&set);
	sigaddset(&set, SIGCHLD);
	sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &set, &oldset);
	pid = fork();
	if (pid == 0) {
		sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &oldset, NULL);
		do_whatever();
		exit(0);
	}
	childs[n].pid = pid;
	sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &oldset, NULL);
This is a common problem. When you have data structures that are
handled by both the main program and by a signal handler, *always* block
the signal when you're handling the data structures in the main program.
