I don't. I was just making clear exactly what kernel source i was using.
It probably haven't got anything to do with the swsusp code, but since
those patches are applied i though i better let you know.
The machine was basically doing nothing since i was out for lunch.
X was running screensaver and it was playing some mp3's.
