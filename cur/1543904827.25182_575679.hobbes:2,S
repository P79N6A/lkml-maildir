Idiomatic form for "has allocation succeeded?" is neither "if (p != 0)" nor
"if (p != NULL)".  It's simply "if (p)".
Note that it depends upon context.  For something that combines assignment
with test
	if ((p = foo_alloc()) != NULL)
would be the right way to go.  Ditto for
	flag = (p == NULL)
(alternative would be "flag = !p", which is usually not nice or even
"flag = !!p" for the opposite test, and that's bloody atrocious).
For places like
-      if (spu_disassemble_table[o] == 0)
+      if (spu_disassemble_table[o] == NULL)
        spu_disassemble_table[o] = &spu_opcodes[i];
it's a matter of taste; there I'd go for explicit comparison with NULL.
I'd also go for explicit comparisons in places like
-               wait_event(journal->j_wait_done_commit, journal->j_task == 0);
+               wait_event(journal->j_wait_done_commit, journal->j_task == NULL);
