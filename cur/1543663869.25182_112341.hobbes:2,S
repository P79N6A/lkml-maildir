Isn't it better to use functions instead of macro's? Reduces the code
size--> less dirty cache-lines.
I saw, by the way, several functions duplicated in the networking-code.
For example a lot of them have a net_random-alike function. Imho they
should use the net_random in utils.c. Sadly my patches were ignored by the
maintainers.
