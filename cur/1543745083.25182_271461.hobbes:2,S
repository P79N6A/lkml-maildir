Subject: 2.6.10-rc2-mm1: oops when accessing reiser4 fs's (maybe fix provided)

I tried 2.6.10-rc2-mm1 and the last reiser4 updates gave some (many many)
oopses flooding my screen :).
I tried reverting reiser4-fix-deadlock.patch and oopses are gone.
I tried this one because thru the quick traces on my screen, I saw a reference
to get_current_context.
The speed of the traces and the unasibility of the box prevented me from
making differences between "real" oopses and BUG_ON(), sorry for that...
If you want some traces I can provide them ASAP (e.g. tomorrow)
Best,
