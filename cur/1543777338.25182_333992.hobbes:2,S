Now that I've read the thread, I see it's not mrlocks that is the
issue with unlocking in a different context - it's semaphores.
All the pagebuf synchronisation is done with a semaphore because
it's held across the I/O and it's _most definitely_ released in a
different context when doing async I/O. Just about all metadata I/O
is async because once the transaction has been logged to disk we
don't need to write these buffers out synchronously. Not to mention
the log I/O completion unlocks the buffers in a transaction in a
different context as well.
The whole point of using a semaphore in the pagebuf is because there
is no tracking of who "owns" the lock so we can actually release it
in a different context. Semaphores were invented for this purpose,
and we use them in the way they were intended. ;)
Realistically, I seriously doubt the need for any sort of rt changes
to these semaphores. They can be held for indeterminant periods of
time potentially across multiple disk I/Os (e.g. when held locked in
a transaction that requires more metadata to be read in from disk to
make progress).  Hence there is no really no point in making them RT
aware because if you end up waiting on one of them you can forget
about pretty much any RT guarantee that you've ever given....
Cheers,
Dave.
