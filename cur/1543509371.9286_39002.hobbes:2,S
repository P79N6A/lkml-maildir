2.2.x kernels were feature frozen in 2.1.x where x is one of the
last 30 version numbers or so.  Once a kernel becomes feature
frozen, bugs are ironed out, and then Linus eventually decides
that the final stable release is ready and releases it.  The last
such major release was 2.2.0.  All kernels after that in the
2.2.x series are stable bug fix kernels.  New features are NOT
added to stable kernels.  2.3.1 would have been the first kernel
that the author of the above patch should have submitted for
inclusion in.
No features submitted for 2.2.x inclusion are likely to ever get
in period as it is not a development kernel series.

The only way ANY patch EVER gets in the kernel is if the AUTHOR
OF THE PATCH actually WANTS their patch included in the kernel to
begin with, *AND* they actually SUBMIT their patch to LINUS, and
any other relevant core developers as well, and also to the
linux-kernel mailing list.  Only then would it EVER be
considered.  Linus does NOT go out looking for cool patches to
add, and then incorporate them.
Before you blast the development team, you should learn how the
development process works.
