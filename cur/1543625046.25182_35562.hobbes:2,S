Seconded; happened to me with 2.4.18 from kernel.org + LVM 2.0 beta
1.1 + Trond's NFS ('current' for 2.4.18). IO was to a local ext3 fs;
no LVM on that machine (modules not loaded).
Lock-up was complete for me; no panic message and no IP either so I
couldn't poke around. Alt+Sysrq seemed dead; but it might have been on
one of the boxen where Linux does not detect Alt+Sysrq properly.
BTW, what's the status of the Sysrq entry key "decoder"? I've about 4
different types of keyboards here, as far as I could determine only
one of them sends Linux-parseable Alt-Sysrq. All do send *something*
on Alt-Sysrq, though; but I couldn't get them to work with the
procedure described in the SysRq manual. That was around 2.4.12.
So long,
   Joe
