I did a bit research using grep, sort, uniq and wc:
between 2.6.9 and 2.6.10:
414 EXPORT_SYMBOL's were removed
since 2.6.10:
90 EXPORT_SYMBOL's were removed in Linus' tree
in 2.6.10-mm2 excluding linus.patch:
71 EXPORT_SYMBOL's are removed
Notes:
- EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL's weren't counted in any way
- if an EXPORT_SYMBOL was moved, it wasn't counted (using uniq)
- small mistakes in the numbers might be possible since my method to
  measure them was't at a scientific level, but after a quick look
  it seems the numbers are roughly correct
Resurrecting and documenting all of these recently removed 
EXPORT_SYMBOL's because some company might have found some way to 
(ab)use one or more of them costs us:
- some extra work
- wasts space for all users of Linux (e.g. some of the recent removals
  are "remove EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed but completely unused function" patches
  I sent)
