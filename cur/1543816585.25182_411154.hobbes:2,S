we are observing a non-time-coherent snapshot of the locking graph.  
There is no guarantee that due to timeouts or signals the chain we 
observe isnt artificially long - while if a time-coherent snapshot is 
taken it is always fine. E.g. lets take dentry locks as an example: 
their locking is ordered by the dentry (kernel-pointer) address. We 
could in theory have a 'chain' of subsequent locking dependencies 
related to 10,000 dentries, which are nicely ordered and create a 
10,000-entry 'chain' if looked at in a non-time-coherent form. I.e. your 
code could detect a deadlock where there's none. The more CPUs there 
are, the larger the likelyhood is that other CPUs 'lure us' into a long 
chain.
In other words: without taking all the locks we have no mathematical 
proof that we detected a deadlock!
also, how does the taking of 2 locks only improve latencies? We still 
have to hold the ->waiter_lock of this lock during this act, dont we? Or 
can we do boosting with totally unlocked (and interrupts-enabled) 
rescheduling points? If yes then the same situation could happen on UP 
too: if there's lots of rescheduling of this boosting chain.
nevertheless it _might_ work in practice, and it's certainly elegant and 
thus tempting. Could you try to port your patch to -rt10? [you can skip 
most of the conflicting rt7->rt10 deltas in rtmutex.c i think.]
