I've been running without preempt for about 28hrs with a make -j5 compile
loop of a kernel tree running, and it looks like it'll do the same thing
again.
Maybe it's from all of the forks as the only things that have been in use are:
mutt (left running, so scanning for new messages in several folders)
exim (receiving message for lkml, debian-(devel|user), etc
top
make -j loop
Mozilla is running, but I haven't been using it...
I'll change to single user mode in monday to check to see if the problem is
reproducable on non-preempt.
The only thing left would be the kernel or glibc (as init still keeps it
open so 'shutdown now' wouldn't free that).
How could I test to kill everything opening glibc and still be able to run a
command to read /proc/meminfo afterward?
