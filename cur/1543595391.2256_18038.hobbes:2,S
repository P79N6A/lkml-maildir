Besides low-level packet frobbing, I can't think of any other
application.
In fact, more appropriate would be to extend netfilter to handle
low-level things as well as med/upper level things.
Then we wouldn't need driver specific things, this is my whole
point.  You're designing for yourself and nobody else.  When
people want to add things to sk_buff it usually is for a
not so well thought reason.
