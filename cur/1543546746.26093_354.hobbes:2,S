I've got a larger decoer matrix in my program at
http://www.flyingbuttmonkeys.com/~rothwell/
if you want to include it.
I have not been able to figure out the real scancode pattern,
if there actually is one, so I've had to create a large and
elaborate lookup table.
It seems to work, however. The books, coke cans, UPS packages, etc.
that I've tried it on seem to scan correctly. If you try it and
have a problem or incorrect scan, let me know.
