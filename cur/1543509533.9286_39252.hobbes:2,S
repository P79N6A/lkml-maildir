I work with compressed video and my average file size is 3-6 gigs,
increasing
all the time (higher bitrates). A while back I looked into using Linux for
a
video application and gave up and went with Solaris and Irix because of
the lack
of large file support. I was hoping that 2.4 would have large file support
(and
not just on 64 bit platforms), but that isn't looking promising based on
comments here. Going to a 64 bit off_t (on 32 bit platforms) is a major
change
and will have a serious impact in user space. Just look at all the pain
Solaris
and Irix had in making the move.
