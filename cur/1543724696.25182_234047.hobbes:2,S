Yes. IBM did some testing and found that was about optimal. No significant
gain was found with anything greater.

You need to be careful increasing the maximum order - you have to remember
that this affects several tables (well, at least two at the moment), and so
the effect is multiplied.
It may be reasonable to let the kernel cmdline override the maximum number of
buckets calculated on the scaling factor provided to the function (effectively
number of buckets per unit memory), but consider that the number of objects
that can be allocated and linked into the table is in effect governed by such
a factor.
