Here too --- actual IO performance is not measurably difference.  Doing
disk IO to highmem page cache pages is going to use a little more CPU
time due to the necessary bounce buffer copying, but I can't see a
measurable difference on page cache performance with highmem enabled
compared to using low memory on PAE36.
