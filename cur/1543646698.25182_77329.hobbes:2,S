Subject: EVMS breaking menuconfig in 2.5.40?

I got EVMS from cvs, found the 2.5.40 patch, applied it, then attempted
to do make menuconfig. 
All that happens is this:
[austin@UberGeek linux-2.5.40]$ make menuconfig
make[1]: Entering directory `/data/build/linux-2.5.40/scripts'
make -C lxdialog all
make[2]: Entering directory `/data/build/linux-2.5.40/scripts/lxdialog'
make[2]: Leaving directory `/data/build/linux-2.5.40/scripts/lxdialog'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/data/build/linux-2.5.40/scripts'
/bin/sh ./scripts/Menuconfig arch/i386/config.in
Using defaults found in .config
Preparing scripts: functions, parsing
and then my console becomes unuseable, I can't even ssh in from another
box, then X dies eventually. 
If I hit and hold ctrl-c for a few seconds after this begins, I can
usually break out, but if I miss it, then well, X blows up pretty good.
make config, works, and xconfig doesn't work for me at all for some
reason. I'll get there yet. :) Wish I had more time to play and diagnose
this.
