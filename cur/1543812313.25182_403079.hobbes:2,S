Subject: [patch 0/14] s3c2412/s3c2413 support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset adds various defines and bits for the s3c2412 and s3c2413
processors, as well as adding detection of this cpu to platform setup and
uncompress boot stage.
The changes should not disturb current s3c24xx implementations. The
patchset is preliminary, in that the final datasheet is not yet 
available. We
did some testing of these new registers and bits outside of the linux
kernel.
