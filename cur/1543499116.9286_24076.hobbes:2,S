Okay, I accept that there's probably no sensible way for LILO to deal
with RAID-[2345] right now.  However, that doesn't mean we should design an
interface that can't support it in a sensible way.  To me that means we
should have an index count passed to FIONDEV.
RAID 2,3,4,5 return the data block on the first call and set the
COPIES flag.  Subsequent calls set the XOR flag to indicate that the
other blocks should be XORed together to recover the original block.
lilo is perfectly free to ignore this information, but maybe someday
we'll have a good way to use this information.
With RAID 1, lilo can install multiple copies of LILO, one on each disc,
each one told about the blocks which exist on its own disc.
