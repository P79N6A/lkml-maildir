I've thought about that many times.  I think the cleanest solution is
to deprecate the '$' entirely:
	dep_tristate ' ..' CONFIG_FOO CONFIG_BAR
and, while we're at it, deprecate the 'dep_' prefix as well - can't
"tristate" and "bool" unambiguously handle this?
I think the above can be done quite easily with a bit of 'eval' work
(which *will* slow down 'make *config' ... but do we care?)
Supporting the old syntax simultaneously should not be hard either.
I'm just not sure whether or not it's appropriate for 2.4.20.  It *is*
easily testable stuff, but....
And I haven't looked at xconfig.  (I don't usually even run X.)
xconfig *does* do static parsing, and is thus superior to Configure
and Menuconfig, but the whole method of "translate Config.in into TCL
then execute it" makes it (imo) really hard to hack on.
Let me see if I can find time to roll a patch sometime today..
