It should be ->start(). You are probably confused a little by the name
of the function. input_release_device() is called when userspace
issues ioctl(fd, EVIOCGRAB, 0) releasing (or ungrabbing) the device
(as opposed to xxx_release(file, inode) type functions that are called
when last user of a file drops off). In our case we want to give
handlers a chance to resume their control over device. Right now
standard keyboard driver uses start method do bring back in sync LED
state of a keyborad-like device after it was released (ungrabbed).

It reason for ->start was explained in the patch it was introduced in,
the changeset you are referring to literally fixes issue with
iteration through list in this function.
