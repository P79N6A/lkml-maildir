I said "stabilization of the main tree" for a reason :)  Like a 
"mini-Andrew", I have over 100 net driver csets waiting for 2.6.10 as well.
The crucial point is establishing a psychology where maintainers only 
submit (and only apply) bug fixes in -rc series.  As long as random 
stuff (like fasync in 2.6.8 release) is getting applied at the last 
minute, we are
* destroying the validity of testing done in -rc prior to release, and
* reducing the value of user testing
* discouraging users from treating -rc as anything but a 'devel' release 
(as opposed to a 'stable' release)

The simple fact is that -mm doesn't receive _nearly_ the amount of 
testing that a 2.6.x -BK snapshot does, which in turn doesn't receive 
_nearly_ the amount of testing that a 2.6.x-rc release gets.
The increase in the amount of testing, and amount of feedback I get for 
my stuff in -mm/-bk versus -rc/release is a very large margin.  For this 
reason, one cannot hold up testing in -mm as nearly having the value of 
testing in -rc.
But with the diminished signal/noise ratio of current -rc...
