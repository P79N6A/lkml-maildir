If it "wants" to crash it can just jump to 0 (or whatever unmapped address
it has) by itself. No need to involve the kernel here.
The only point of the patch was to not make the kernel/CPU crash due 
to CPU bugs triggered by applications. But we really
don't care what happens to the application when it corrupts its stack frame.
