got this problem when applying 2.4.18-pre8-mjc to 2.4.18-pre8 to 2.4.17 as
well as newly released 2.4.18-pre8-mjc2
filemap.c: In function `__find_page_nolock':
filemap.c:404: structure has no member named `next_hash'
Not sure if this is related to Rik's rmap patch or Ingo's O(1) Scheduler
patch (or again, something else entirely)
your mjc2 patch contains....
patch-2.4.18-pre9-mjc2:-        struct page *next_hash;         /* Next page
sharing our hash bucket in
patch-2.4.18-pre9-mjc2:-        struct page **pprev_hash;       /*
Complement to *next_hash. */
which modifes linux/include/linux/mm.h
if i comment out the line in filemap.c it continues to compile... until
problems with ip.h (more to come)
