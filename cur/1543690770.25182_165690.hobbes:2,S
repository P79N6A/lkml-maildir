Actually with 2.6, you no longer need ide-scsi.  You'll need to upgrade 
your cdrecord tools and probably your burning GUI, if you use one.  I've 
been burning that way for several months now.  (I'm using xcdroast, 
though I need to start it with "-n" since I'm using cdrecord 2.01a18.)  
This actually works better for me than ide-scsi as for some reason it 
uses less CPU.
