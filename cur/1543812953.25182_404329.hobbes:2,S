Excellent, I've opened the can of worms.
Yes, games are a in incredibly complex beast.
No they shouldn't need real time scheduling to work well if they are coded 
properly. However, witness the fact that most of our games are windows 
ports, therefore being lower quality than the original. Witness also the 
fact that at last with dual core support, lots and lots (but not all) of 
windows games on _windows_ are having scheduling trouble and jerky playback, 
forcing them to crappily force binding to one cpu. As much as I'd love to 
blame windows, it is almost certainly due to the coding of the application 
since better games don't exhibit this problem. Now the games in question 
can't be trusted to even run on SMP; do you really think they could cope 
with good real time code? Good -complex- real time coding is very difficult. 
If you take any game out there that currently exists and throw real time 
scheduling at it, almost certainly it will hang the machine. No, I don't 
believe games need realtime scheduling to work well; they just need to be 
written well and the kernel needs to be unintrusive enough to work well with 
them. Otherwise gaming would have needed realtime scheduling from day 
one on all operating systems. Generic kernel activities should not cause 
game stuttering either as users have little control over them. I do expect 
users to not run too many userspace programs while trying to play games 
though. I do not believe we should make games work well in the presence of 
updatedb running for example.
