You've missed the important difference - HE didn't write any kernel
addition as part of his script, so by getting them added to the
kernel, he can pretend that his script is just that, entirely script,
rather than being dependant on some kernel bloat that's written in C
code...
Personally, I feel that the only non-kernel-specific scripts worth
writing are those that work unchanged on Linux, FreeBSD, SunSolaris
and other UNIX systems, and even if Linus was stupid enough to accept
his ideas, it's unlikely he'd persuade enough of the other Unices to
do so to make the ideas acceptable in the first place... 
By "non-kernel-specific scripts", I mean scripts that are not directly
part of the configuration and/or installation of a specific kernel, in
the way that "Configure" and "Menuconfig" are. I specifically do NOT
exclude "administrative scripts", such as the secure delete function
that appears to be his raison d'etre for adding the proposed kernel
bloat to satisfy his whims, since that's a facility that, if
implemented, should work on ANY of the various flavours of UNIX...
Best wishes from Riley.
