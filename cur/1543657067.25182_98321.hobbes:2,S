That's as designed (and epoll behaves that way, too, doesn't it?);
when applications start using sigio or epoll on a socket, they
have to assume it's readable/writable initially.  There was a huge
argu^H^H^H^H thread about that recently with subject
"epoll (was Re: [PATCH] async poll for 2.5)"

Sounds fishy... but I'd need to see your code to know more.

Yes. Blindly call the handler, and do I/O until you get an
EWOULDBLOCK.  That's precisely what you're supposed to do when
you start using sigio on an fd.

It works ok, once you get used to its oddities.
sys_epoll works better, but sigio isn't terrible as a fallback.
