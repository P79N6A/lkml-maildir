   attached to try_to_swap_out, so that's probably enough not to
   call schedule, but I don't see any such spinlock held.  Moreover,
   the comment would seem to indicate it _is_ legal to sleep, so
   long as you indicate that it happened.
No, mm->page_table_lock is held here, and in the vast majority
of TLB/CACHE flushing calls.  In fact Linus and I agreed that we
wanted to make this in fact an invariant for the calls, so that
the implementation could rely on the lock being held always during
such calls, and thus have a consistent execution/locking environment.
