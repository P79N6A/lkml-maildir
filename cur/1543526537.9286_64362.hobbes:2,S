* don't use interruptible_sleep_on(), the function can lock up unless
your code is protected by the big kernel lock [and new code shoudn't
rely on that lock].
If your code doesn't need any spinlocks, then you could use
wait_event_interruptible(), otherwise copy the code from
wait_event_interruptible() and release your spinlock just before calling
schedule().

Do you try to sleep within the interrupt handler? You can't do that.
