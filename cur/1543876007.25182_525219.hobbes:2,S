I somewhat disagree.  Look at the amount of _design_ which is going  
into the linux-virtualization stuff, the replacement SLAB subsystems  
(SLOB/SLUB), or the current queued-spinlock thread.  Admittedly with  
Linux 90% of the design process is rewriting the code a thousand  
times based on comments before it goes into mainline, but that's  
design nonetheless.  It's just evolved-design-by-committee, a very  
knowledgeable committee made of the people who are interested in and  
understand what's going on well enough to give useful input and with  
enough sense of technical value to veto anything with significant  
architectural problems.
Cheers,
