Hello, Greg.
Please read the other reply first.  We need some consensus there first.

This is a package deal with the autorenaming.  More on this later.

To rename symlink when its target or one of its ancestors is renamed or
moved, sysfs should be able to determine what should be the new name of
the symlink when it points to the new target, right?  So, we need
symlink name formatting to do this.
I think the implemented formatting scheme covers all symlinks.  Symlink
name formatting will also simplify callers.  No need to allocate name,
format and free it.  It can simply use constant string.

Yes, we can.  This is the way to do it with the new interface.  More on
this below.

Plugged creation + batch error handling is a way to group operations and
commit them atomically under the new interface.  The problem of visible
partial creation / removal is mostly solved using
device->uevent_suppress but I think things can be improved for both
userland and kernel.
After uevent is moved into sysfs, uevent generation can be coupled with
grouped commit.  sysfs hierarchy and accompanying uevents will appear
atomically to userland and in-kernel users end up with simpler and less
buggy code - single error check at the end of all sysfs operations
instead of piece-by-piece construction coupled with the same amount of
unroll code which is usually buggy.  Maybe in (long) time, sysfs access
can be simplified for embedded systems or whatnot.
I don't really see much downside other than the added complexity and as
the added complexity will reduce complexity in the users, I think it's a
good trade off.
Thanks.
