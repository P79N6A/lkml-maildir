Well, the thing is, that if somebody has a page mapped, there's nothing we
can do if the server and client disagrees. 
We just cannot invalidate the page - people would actually lose data, and
would lose major local consistency guarantees that UNIX filesystems are
supposed to get. 
So it's a matter of one sort of consistency against another - and I think
the local consistency requirements are the stricter ones, considering that
we don't even _know_ whether the server has really changed those pages or
not..
