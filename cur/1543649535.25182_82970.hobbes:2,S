No, definitely not >=.  Realtime signals are tested for separately, and
SIGRTMIN is the number of the lowest RT signal, not the number of the
highest non-realtime signal.  Take a look in include/asm-i386/signal.h:
#define SIGSYS          31
#define SIGUNUSED       31
/* These should not be considered constants from userland.  */
#define SIGRTMIN        32
#define SIGRTMAX        (_NSIG-1)
