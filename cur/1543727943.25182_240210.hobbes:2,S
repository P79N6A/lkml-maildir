Interesting....still, you'd have to
- - chmod /proc/cmdline
- - chmod /var/log/boot.msg
- - klogctl: reset the kernel message ring buffer
- - ...anything else?
seem's like preventing such data from showing up in the first place would be
much more appropriate. Also, what if that data isn't even for root's eye's
(yes, I am security guy)?
