Depends. Only if the file system does the right thing here, iirc only
reiserfs with barriers enabled issue a real disk flush for fsync. So you
can't rely on it in general.

BLKFLSBUF doesn't flush the disk cache either, it just flushes
every dirty page in the block device address space. It would not be very
hard to do, basically we have most of the support code in place for this
for IO barriers. Basically it would be something like:
blockdev_cache_flush(bdev)
{
        request_queue_t *q = bdev_get_queue(bdev);
        struct request *rq = blk_get_request(q, WRITE, GFP_WHATEVER);
        int ret;
        ret = blk_execute_rq(q, bdev->bd_disk, rq, 0);
        blk_put_request(rq);
        return ret;
}
Somewhat simplified of course, but it should get the point across.
Putting that in fs/buffer.c:sync_blockdev() would make BLKFLSBUF work.
As always with these things, the devil is in the details. It requires
the device to support a ->prepare_flush() queue hook, and not all
devices do that. It will work for IDE/SATA/SCSI, though. In some devices
you don't want/need to do a real disk flush, it depends on the write
cache settings, battery backing, etc.
