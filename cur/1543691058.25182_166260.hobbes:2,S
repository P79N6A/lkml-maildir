My concern is trying to prevent 
the flood of emails where someone thinks they built 
a "standard" kernel only to  discover that they forgot 
to select the various suboptions
and it doesn't work on their processor. I'd like
to simplfy what the majority of folks need to do
to get a broadly working kernel.
I'd prefer that some set of options "take away"
rather than "add" features/work-arounds. In the case below,
I'd prefer a "don't support Athlon Prefetch Errata".
I think you can argue that some features are going to 
be common enough for the majority of users that they
should be in the "take-away" category.
Others are uncommon enough that they fall into
the "add" category.
If you stick with consistent nomenclature 
(e.g. add_feature_TBD & sub_default_feature_TBD) 
and put these options in one common config file, 
I think the embedded folks and the 
"optimize every last bit" folks get 
what they want.
