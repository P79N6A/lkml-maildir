That's good, because the recheck-i_size idea was racy too.  If another
thread were to do a quick truncate-then-extend then there's a window where
we'd see a truncated page, return NULL from page_cache_pipe_buf_map() and
then by the time i_size is re-checked, i_size has grown again so we end up
deciding it must have been an IO error.
