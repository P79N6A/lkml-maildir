You might start looking for other problems, then.  I'm not sure what
the v90q stuff is; kinda sounds like a modem.  I've used the FA310TX on
both an Abit (BH6) and an Asus (P5A).  Make sure that your PCI stuff is
set up correctly.  That's what I'd look at.  The NetGear drivers have
been tested with the NetGear products, so there's no reason they
shouldn't work. Also, I've had them working (excclusively with the NG
drivers) on 2.0.35, 2.0.36, 2.2.1 - 2.2.5 (ever since I got them).
What application are you using the cards for, anyhow?  IS it just basic
network connectivity, or are  you trying to hook up to a cable modem or
something?
