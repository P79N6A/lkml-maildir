But there is no race protection in the *caller*, so if it can ever return 
one or the other, what protects it from changing once the caller returns?
And if the value can change (because some thread uses "use_mm()"), then 
the caller cannot rely on the value that got returned.
So you migt as well not return any value at all, since the returned value 
is apparently meaningless once the lock has been released.
In other words: "The lock, it does nothing".
