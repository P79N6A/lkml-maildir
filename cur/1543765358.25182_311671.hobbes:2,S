I think you misunderstood what I meant by "remove the 'id' thing" 
(probably my fault). ds1337_do_command() is needed by ppc7d so don't 
remove it. I meant remove the id parameter from the call and change the 
ds1337 driver to support only one instance of the device.

For ppc at least, it's the platform code that hooks up get_rtc_time().
Last time I looked in -mm, get_rtc_time() and set_rtc_time() were being 
set up in ppc7d to use this driver. I won't be able to check until the 
end of the week so please bear with me.

I don't understand. What code in ds1337 is unneeded?

Ok. Jean, what do you think? Do we really want a "charge" sysfs entry? I 
don't have a strong opinion on this.

Please don't apply this patch. I will modify the ds1337_do_command() API 
to remove the "id" parameter and fixup ppc7d platform accordingly.
