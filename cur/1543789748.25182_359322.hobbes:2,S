I don't think you want to increase the priority of keventd.
You need to create a seperate kernel thread for your module's
work. That thread's priority can be set with set_user_nice()...
 	set_user_nice(current, -19);
Older kernels required:
 	task_lock(current);
         current->nice = -19;
         task_unlock(current);
The kernel thread can set this up when it is first started.
