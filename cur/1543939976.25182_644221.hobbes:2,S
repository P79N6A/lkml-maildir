I believe there is some sort of bug in libata, not just for this kernel
version.
i run a fileserver with .20, and i get these resets a few times a day..
no freezes though... except when its in progress, then all IO freezes
and locks up applications using it.. but it passes after ~30sec.
i know that since ubuntu started shipping with libata by default for
IDE, a large number of people are seeing these intermittant freezes
aswell(which passes after half a minute or less).
i reported this before, however as far as i know, no reason, and much
less a fix, has been found.
it would be great to get this solved though.
