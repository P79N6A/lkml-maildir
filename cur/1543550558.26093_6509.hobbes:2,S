	I am fairly sure that that is in series of "will patent
	that so that nobody can ransom us"...  (Like IBM did
	with HTML.)
	Surprisingly I don't see any patent at Cisco Systems which
	relates to that ?   They have been doing ether-channel for
	ages, but perhaps their solution is just an implementation
	of Sun's idea ?
