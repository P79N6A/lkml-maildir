Applied patches 1-2.  Thanks to everyone involved -- you, Randy, and 
Forrest (who probably won't see this message).
I applied this to the new 'acpi' branch of libata-dev.git, and merged it 
into the meta-branch 'ALL', so that it will be automatically picked up 
by akpm's -mm tree.
I want this to get some testing before it goes upstream.
