Damn. I applied your patch, but it breaks on x86-64:
   drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c:271: error: 'local_apic_timer_c2_ok' 
	undeclared (f irst use in this function)
I really wish we had an x86-64 maintainer that understood that it's 
confusing that files in arch/i386/ are also used for arch/x86-64.
