Shouldn't the kernel have usage count for irqs? I thought request_irq(),
etc. only track activly listening drivers, not devices that will use it
later but aren't at this second (e.g. parallel ports for printing).  This
would help some of the problems in PCMCIA in my limited understanding.
Isn't that good resource management too?  This should also be applied for
driver mem and IO mem, too, no?

I think that the PCMCIA packages suffers from one major problem, the rest
of these problems are just symptoms of this problem: The PCMCIA package is
two things that are separate: an enabler daemon and the drivers.
The drivers should be in the kernel and the enabler should be in
user land.  I see no reason why a computer with a PCMCIA device (net card
or some such) shouldn't be able to compile in only the net card and
nothing else from the PCMCIA stuff, allowing the system to automatically
deal with this one card and nothing else.
Yes you loose hotswap, but who cares, it should still be an option.
All this doesn't fix the fact that install via BIOS pre-kernel-boot PCMCIA
devices will always be a special case.
Ciao!
