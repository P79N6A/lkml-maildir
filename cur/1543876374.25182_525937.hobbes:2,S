Well, that's the point - i fix cpu speed at 1ghz and everything works
UNTIL I launch mplayer. I've just reproduced this (set governor,
launched mplayer and waited 15-20 mins) and the whole system seems
frozen - just like before. Network is down (no responses to ping). How
to redirect dmesg to serial port? (I'm running 2.6.19 kernel and
8.34.8 fglrx driver.)
Thanks and sorry for 2week delay... (btw - now it is you [ati] who is
responsible for both my cpu and gpu drivers, yes? :D)
