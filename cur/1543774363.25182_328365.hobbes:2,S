What reiserfs4 brings is file based plugins. Which is
extremely useful and powerful. I don't want to see
this go away.
I think it is the task of the linux community to
generalize the vfs layer and not lock out reiserfs4
until that is done. reiserfs4 wants to keep a plugin
id for each and every file. An additional filesystem
layer is the traditional solution to achieve advanced
features, but not an optimal solution in my opinion.
Yes gnome, kde and perhaps cifs do it. But if instead
they used file plugins a lot more could be shared.
