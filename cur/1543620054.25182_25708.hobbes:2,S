Has anyone else noticed the availability of only one help section in
"choice" blocks when using make menuconfig (and others maybe?)? 
The best example of this is selection of "Processor family". No matter
which option is highlighted when Help is selected, it always gives the
help for CONFIG_M386.
I thought this was possibly by design until I checked
Documentation/Configure.help and found help sections for the other CPU
families.
