Hello all.
A friend of mine has some problems with Samba. He told me he can't mount 
Windows shares with smbclient 2.0.2. Kernel is 2.2.1, Red Hat 5.2 (I think).
The Samba package was retrieved from Red Hat. I know this is very little info, 
but has somebody run into problems with a similar setup? I would try to do 
some testings and compare my results with that of my friend, but I have no 
Windows machine at hand right now.
Thanks in advance.
