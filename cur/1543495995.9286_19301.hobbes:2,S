Subject: 2.3.2 alpha disable_irq patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In 2.3.2 there is:
+disable_irq(unsigned int irq_nr)
+{
+	/* This works non-SMP, and SMP until we write code to distribute
+	   interrupts to more that cpu 0.  */
+	disable_irq_nosync(irq_nr);
If I understand well this mean that on Alpha all irqs goes to the same
CPU0 in SMP. But disable_irq() can run also on CPU1 so I think the code
above is wrong.
Does somebody tried my Alpha patch I posted to the kernel list some days
ago?
