Linus has just merged all the VFS renaming patches, so the decks
are clear for looking at this work.
However David and Christoph are beavering away on the r-o-bind-mounts
patches and I expect that there will be overlaps with unprivileged mounts.
Could we coordinate things a bit please?  Decide who goes first, review
and maybe even test each others work, etc?
Thanks.
