Sorry, I don't understand this suggestion.  I don't read LKML, please
don't suppose any prior knowledge of the jargon used here...  Do you
mean I should use the bleeding edge git source of the kernel?  Not
something I'm eager to do, but can do, actually.  And would you send
me patches separately on top of that?

I expected an improper way to have some disadvantages at least. :)
Anyway, I can tolerate some glitches during the porting of this
module, resulting in interruptions of the serial devices, but leaving
the rest of the system mostly stable; it's a production system after
all.  If the changes are more threatening, I'll use another system for
the tests.  In short: suggest a method and let's give a chance for the
proper solution.  Just please enclose some risk assessment.
