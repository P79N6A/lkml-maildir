Do you know what the console loglevel was when you tried
to use Alt-SysRq-M (show_mem) or Alt-SysRq-T (show tasks ==
show_state)?  (first value listed in /proc/sys/kernel/printk file)
show_mem() and show_state() don't modify the current value of
console_loglevel; they depend on the sysrq handler to do that.
That value could be too low/small.
E.g., if console_loglevel is 4, show_mem and show_state don't
show me anything on the console either, but they are added
to the log file.

Aye, sysrq_handle_term sets console_loglevel to 8 and leaves it there.
