Ok, sorry. That was a typo.
I should not do more than 3 things at the same time. :)

Ok, so maybe it is best if every device creates its own macros
for convenience (if needed => if it is a common pattern
in the scope of the driver).
Example:
#define bcm43xx_lock(bcm, flags)	spin_lock_irqsave(&(bcm)->lock, flags)
#define bcm43xx_unlock(bcm, flags)	do { mmiowb(); spin_unlock_irqrestore(&(bcm)->lock, flags); } while (0)
