No, it's permitted.  What would violate the PCI spec would be failing
to decode the full 32/64 bit address and creating aliases (like 10-bit
ISA cards did).  This is just a reestriction on which parts of memory
a card can DMA to.

Actually, it'd be useful to have a central list of what DMA masks devices
really take.  It might provide some arguments for changing the zone allocater.
