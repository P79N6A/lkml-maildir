`no wrap around' is not the only answer.
You could instead fix the problem at the source:
allow a potential killer to hold on to a process (preventing its
entry from being reused) just like the parent already does it (leaving
the child in zombie state until it is reaped).
This way you could do
	> ps aux | grep foobar
	  1234 10:23 foobar
	> grab 1234
	> ps aux | grep 1234
	  1234 10:23 foobar
	> kill 1234
