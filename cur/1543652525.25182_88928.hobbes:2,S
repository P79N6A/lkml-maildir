Sort of, there is a limit to how many k of arguments you can have on a
command line. Having grown up with much smaller limits in early UNIX, I
got into the habit of using xargs when I wasn't sure. You can avoid one
exec per file behaviour by something like:
  ls | xargs -l50 echo | xargs -i mv "{}" destdir
You can also do useful things by using find and the -p option of cpio.
