My little program was crude at best.
You have to take into account what the machines are doing.  If you
notice, the "Min" latency is about the same, so it's not a CPU cycle
saver.  The long "Max" latencies mean you probably have something on IP2
that is blocking the execution of the IP stack (for, say up to 4.5ms). 
Are all the machine completely quiesced except for the test program? 
Have you tried switching the network connections to see if it is in the
network hardware?
