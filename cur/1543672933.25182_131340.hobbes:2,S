Only with kerneldoc ... :)
I'd certainly like the list_head.  Patch attached,
in case Greg agrees enough.  On x86, this makes
sizeof(struct urb) == 120, so it's using space
that was previously wasted.
As for the skb->cb analogue(s), details need working.
  - What should "X" be?  skb->cb is 48 bytes.
  - Should the cb[] arrays be "long"?  They tend to
    be used for pointers...
  - The HCDs want different amounts of per-urb data.
    Sizes on x86:
      * UHCI wants a lot -- 60 bytes!
      * OHCI typically uses 16 bytes, but more for
        multi-TD urbs (control 24 bytes, ISO often 36).
      * EHCI doesn't allocate such extra data.
  - The HCDs would need conversion to use hcd_cb[].
    I once had a patch that did that, but it's not
    current.  It made urb->cb replace urb->hcpriv.
I suppose X=60 for hcd_cb[] will be enough, at least
on 32 bit CPUs.  But you start to see why in the
new "USB Gadget" API, the analogue of "urb" gets
allocated by the USB (device) controller rather
than by generic code:  so that in typical cases,
no additional per-request allocations are needed.
