Ok, but with dynamic IP, NAT, and reboots, you can also get incorrect
results with today's implementation, if you see a RST with the correct
sequence number (not the off-by-one incorrect one).  It's just a
probabilistic argument that this is unlikely to happen in practice --
namely, it only happens with probability 1/2^32 (you hope).
There's no fundamental reason why you couldn't accept off-by-one sequence
numbers as well, if it was deemed important for interoperability;
the probability would just increase to 1/2^31, which is still small
(albeit not as small as 1/2^32).
Right?  Or am I still missing something?  I'm not a TCP expert.
