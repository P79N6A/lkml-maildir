All it needs is for someone to add the definition for NO_IRQ to all
architecture header files.  ARM has an established use of NO_IRQ
already with currently 34 uses:
/*
 * Use this value to indicate lack of interrupt
 * capability
 */
#ifndef NO_IRQ
#define NO_IRQ  ((unsigned int)(-1))
#endif
I'd prefer not to do another mindless time wasteful change just because
someone decides to use a different name.
