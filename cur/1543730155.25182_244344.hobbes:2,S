Its already been kicked around on the Fedora list to actually build such
a database automatically. I've seen similar Debian proposals a long time
ago. That means some time post install you'd let the user
fire up a system report tool which would ask things like
	"Does sound work"
and then fire off PCI id/rating info to a central site. That would help
deal with the data collection much as the Debian folks collect package
popularity statistics.

If you get enough data then the deviation tells you how varied and how
reliable the opinions are likely to be, all this implies databases not
WIki however
