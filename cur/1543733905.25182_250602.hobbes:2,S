the boot ones can be pretty bad at times and usually they are not a
worry: there's no user functionality during bootup so latencies have no
ill effects - the bootup itself is one huge 30-60 second latency to the
user!
If they happen during regular use too they are a problem. (not including
latencies that happen when suspending/resuming the laptop.)

i'd suggest to reset the latency max via this line in
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:
   echo 30 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
this way you can delimit the boot-time ones from the ones that happen
later during normal use.
