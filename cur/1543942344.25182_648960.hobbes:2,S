Thanks for the reply, Greg.
If these counters are not always available by default, then
I've lost most of their value for supporting systems in the field.
Plus, I think I can live with just the individual sysfs files,
given Bjorn's "grep . *" tip.
So if I follow the rules, do you think it is okay to put
these stats in sysfs?  In the hopes the answer is "yes",
I'll reply with a refreshed patch
cheers,
-Len
