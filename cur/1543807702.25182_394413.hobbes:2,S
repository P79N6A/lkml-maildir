Thanks for doing that work. It's needed imho and was on my todo list.

I don't think it's a good idea to add it to the struct mempolicy. I've tried to
make it as memory efficient as possibile and it would be a waste to add such
a mostly unused field. Better to pass that information around in some other way.
(in the worst case it could be a upper bit in policy, but I would prefer
function arguments I think) 
The rest looks good.
