The patch looks good.  But isn't there still a problem with
device_release_driver()?  It doesn't wait for the klist_node to be removed
from the klist before unlocking the device and moving on.  As a result, if
another driver was waiting to bind to the device you would corrupt the
list pointers, by calling klist_add_tail() for the new driver before
klist_release() had run for the old driver.
I'll be interested to see how you manage to solve this.  The only way I 
can think of is to avoid using driver_for_each_device() in 
driver_detach().
