Why would rw_verify_area() return -EINVAL? It does
        if (unlikely((pos < 0) || (loff_t) (pos + count) < 0))
                goto Einval;
but pos and "loff_t" is 64-bit, and if the thing is negative in 64 bits, 
then that thing really _should_ fail.
Yes, the thing needs to be opened with O_LARGEFILE and you need to use 
"llseek()" to seek into it, but once you do that, everything should be 
fine.
