It really isn't that simple. ISAPnP and later ISA cards often allowed
the IRQ to be configured at runtime. Drivers doing this depend upon the
request_irq failing to decide which interrupt line to assign. The
resource management side of exclusive IRQ allocation is for better or
worse deeply embedded in the current interrupt design.
