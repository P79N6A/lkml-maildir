I know.  IMHO it's still preferable to use struct devfs_entry * over
devfs_handle_t like all the devfs mess does.  This would work when
devfs_handle_t suddenly points to something else.

At least the devfs_set_* / devfs_get_* can be removed easily when
leaving the sn1 stuff danling.  But I already discussed that with
the responsible persons.

So is the answer yes or no now? :)

Hmm.  I don't think it's worth the effort, but if you can do it without
introducing major ugliness you have my vote.
