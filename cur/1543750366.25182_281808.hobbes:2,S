I have attached the diff attached in this message for the lkml.

Yes.

Yes, as long as TIF_SINGLESTEP is not set in set_singlestep(). 
set_singlestep also sets PT_DTRACE, so as it now is, a call to the
set_singlestep function will make this condition true clearing TF when
run.  So both the conditional TF clear and setting TIF_SINGLESTEP
needs to be removed, like I show in the diff.   Making these changes
returns the code to a 2.6.8-ish resemblence.
For the wine people, I will try to upload the seh debug channel logs
as soon as possible.
