For example someone may want to inject kmalloc()/kmem_cache_alloc()
failures into only e100 module. they want to inject not only direct
kmalloc() call, but also indirect allocation, too.
- e100_poll --> netif_receive_skb --> packet_rcv_spkt --> skb_clone
  --> kmem_cache_alloc
This patch enables to detect function calls like this by stacktrace
and inject failures. The script
Documentaion/fault-injection/failmodule.sh
helps it.
The range of text section of loaded e100 is expected to be
[/sys/module/e100/sections/.text, /sys/module/e100/sections/.exit.text)
So failmodule.sh stores these values into /debug/failslab/address-start
and /debug/failslab/address-end.

As I wrote in another reply, There are two type of implementation of
this stacktrace filter.
- using STACKTRACE + FRAME_POINTER
- using new unwinder (STACK_UNWIND)
The stacktrace with using new unwinder without FRAME_POINTER is much
slower than STACKTRACE + FRAME_POINTER.
