These two are both reported by me, are the same issue.  The exact same kernel,
one with PIIXn tuning enabled, will hang the hardware on boot requiring a
physical power loss to restart.
No tuning options applied, only the capability enabled in the kernel, makes it
crash.
If necessary I can again provide the boot log and a verbose lspci and whatever
else is desired.  I'll even let you log in and look at it.
