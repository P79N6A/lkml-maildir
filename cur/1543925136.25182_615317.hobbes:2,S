Then I think it's necessary to expose the XX interfaces.  Otherwise, the 
backend has to deal with doing all register operations at a per-byte 
granularity which adds a whole lot of complexity on a per-device basis 
(as opposed to a little complexity once in the transport layer).
You really want to be able to rely on multi-byte atomic operations too 
when setting values.  Otherwise, you need another register to just to 
signal when it's okay for the device to examine any given register.
