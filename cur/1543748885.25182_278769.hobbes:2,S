Thanks, I set it to 9942 and checking with ptktime and it's looking 
good, before it was drifting by 3 seconds by this time - with 9926 it 
was losing slightly, 2 secs in about 5 minutes. On the laptops and the 
Mandrake box that are rock solid it is set at 10,000, the P-II/333 
laptop is using the SuSE 9.2 kernel and the others are on 2.6.10-rc3.
Regards
Sid.
