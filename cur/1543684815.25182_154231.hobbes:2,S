For a start the kernel VFS dcache would break because you end up with
multiple entries for each inode, one entry for each parallel directory
tree.  Read-only you are just about able to get away with it (been there,
done that, don't recommend it!) but allow files to be deleted and it will
blow up in your face.
You ask for examples of applications?  There are millions!  Anything that
walks the directory tree for a start, e.g. ls -R, find, locatedb, medusa,
du, any type of search and/or indexing engine, chown -R, cp -R, scp
-R, chmod -R, etc...
Best regards,
