Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Thanks to everybody for their constructive comments on my previous 
patch posting.  I ended up eliminating one patch, and combining two
of the others, so we're down to 5 from the original 7.  
Patches 1 and 2 from before have been combined into 1 patch, and patch
4 (IDE) has been removed all together in lieu of a better patch floating
around on the linux-ide list.
Al patches following have individual changelogs attached. 
Thanks again for your comments - keep 'em coming.
Jordan
