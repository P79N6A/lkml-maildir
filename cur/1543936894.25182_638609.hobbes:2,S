Hmm,
Part of me wants to say the safest thing for now would be to refuse
mounts propagation from non-user mounts to user mounts.
I assume you're thinking about a fully user-mounted chroot, where
the user woudl still want to be able to stick in a cdrom and have
it automounted under /mnt/cdrom, propagated from the root mounts ns?
But then are there no devices which the user could create on a floppy
while inserted into his own laptop, owned by his own uid, then insert
into this machine, and use the device under the auto-mounted /dev/floppy
to gain inappropriate access?
