Subject: [2.5.53] Cannot open root device

I have some problems booting kernel 2.5.53, it seems to be unable to
find my root fs:
VFS: Cannot open root device "305" or 03:05
The kernel is booted via lilo:
image = /boot/bzImage-2.5.53
        root = /dev/hda5
        label = linux-2.5.53
        read-only
Appending "root=/dev/hda5" or "root=305" at command line doesn't work. I
was able to boot only using root=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/taget0/lun0/part5.
devsfs  is automatically  mounted at  boot, but  appending devfs=nomount
doesn't change anything.
I have also an other problem that can be related to this:
/dev/hda5 on / type ext2 (rw)
mount: /dev/hda6 has wrong device number or fs type reiserfs not supported.
mount: /dev/hda7 has wrong device number or fs type xfs not supported.
Both reiserfs and xfs are compiled as module (yes, I'm using module-init
0.9.5). I can  mount hda6 and  hda7 from the  shell and the  modules are
loaded automatically.
2.5.52 shows the same behaviour, 2.5.49 worked fine. Didn't tried 2.5.50
and 2.5.51.
I'm a bit confused...
