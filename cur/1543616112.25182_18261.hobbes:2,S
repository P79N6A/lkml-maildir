eepro.c is broken in 2.2.19 (and for a while before that).
A minor update went into 2.2.20.
Major updates are in the works now (e.g. see 2.2.21-pre2).
As for the 2.2.19/2.2.20 version, if you want it to recognise
more that one card then apply this simple fix to init_module():
                d->mem_end      = mem[n_eepro];
                d->base_addr    = io[0];
                d->irq          = irq[n_eepro];
                d->init         = eepro_probe;
Change the [0] to [n_eepro] in the second line. But this version
is still unstable under load!
