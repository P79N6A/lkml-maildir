Starting I/O immediately if there is no load sounds nice. However,
what about the other case, when the disc is already spun down (and
hence there's no I/O load either)? I want the system to avoid doing
writes while the disc is spun down. I'm quite happy for the system to
accumulate dirtied pages/buffers, reclaiming clean pages as needed,
until it absolutely has to start writing out (or I call sync(2)).
Right now I hack that by setting bdflush parameters to 5 minutes. But
that's not ideal either.
