Well, its all relative.  Not going into overload to begin with, and
therefore not hitting the pull_rt_tasks() logic outright should be
faster than lockless scanning tricks ;)
But I digress.  I don't think the original code had your optimization,
so you are right:  It's perhaps a bit of an exaggeration in HEAD.  I'll
be less dramatic for the next drop ;)

Ah, yes.  Good eye.  I will devise a fix.
