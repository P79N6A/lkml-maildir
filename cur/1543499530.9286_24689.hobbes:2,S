Hi,
Well, after an hour or so of hammering a large 2.2.10 (build on
egcs-1.1.2) SMP box with all manner of lmdd big file copies/compares,
100 process and 150 process dbench stressers, parallel kernel builds and
concurrent NFS loading, absolutely nothing has gone wrong for me.  The
filesystem is not known for bit-flipping errors, anyway: looks like the
problem must be elsewhere, but right now I have no idea where.  
eexpress100/pro, Adaptec AIC-7895 twin-channel scsi.  Seems to work.
The reports of breakage have included both ide and scsi, though, so that
doesn't help much.
