usually like this:
	int fd;
	void * map;
	char vec[VEC_SIZE];
	fd = open("/your/file, O_RDONLY);
	if (fd == -1) {
		perror("open");
		exit(-1);
	}
	map = mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
	if (!map) {
		perror("mmap");
		close(fd);
		exit(-1);
	}
	if (mincore(map, readlength, vec))
		perror("mincore");
the vec[] contains a byte for each page you queried.  each byte has value 
"1" if the page is already in memory, otherwise "0".
