This is why I added a config option.

A small util could easily be written to do the same job, just comparing
it to the default config. Although I agree it's much easier to do a
search like this when it is in it's original form.

I'm not sure either, but I don't know of any programs that uses this.
Putting this config file inside the same source tree as it was compiled
with, and then just starting and stopping menuconfig will restore it to
it's original form.
