   Ted Ts'o is the one who has been working on that side of it.  Ted, any
   updates? 
I've been hosed lately due to conference travel, and other issues (LSB,
e2fsprogs releases, serial driver).  I'm hoping to have some time to
work on it more come December; I don't have an ETA for the Btree
functionality at this point.
