Hi Linus,
I request inclusion of the SAS Transport Layer
and the AIC-94xx SAS LLDD into the Linux kernel.
Please find your latest git tree with SAS
Transport Layer and AIC-94xx, patches and
a whole tar.bz2 tree here:
http://linux.adaptec.com/sas/
There you will also find the original announcements
posted to this list.
The code is updated twice daily or more often as
needed.
Thank you,
	Luben
P.S. This is a second resend of an identical message
I posted to lkml and lsml yesterday.
