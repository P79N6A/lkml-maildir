Subject: [PATCH] Reduce <linux/debugfs.h> dependencies
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/28/128

The current <linux/debugfs.h> include file is a little fragile in that
it is not self-contained and hence may cause compile warnings or
errors depending on the files included before it, the kernel config
and the architecture.  This patch makes things a little more robust by:
 - including <linux/types.h> to get definitions of u32, mode_t, and so on.
 - forward declaring struct file_operations.
 - including <linux/err.h> when CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is not set
The last change is particularly useful, as a kernel developer is
likely to build with debugfs always enabled and never see the build
breakage cased if debugfs is disabled.
