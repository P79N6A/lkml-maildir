What are the semantics of the mmap'ing the buffer? With mmaped packet
socket the userspace (read-side) requires no sys-calls apart from when
the buffer is empty, it then uses poll(2) to sleep until something new
is put in the buffer. Can relayfs do a similar thing? poll is not
mentioned in the docs...
Thanks.
