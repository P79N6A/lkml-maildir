Quite frankly, I have absolutely _zero_ visibility into things like this, 
so before I merge it I want ack's from various layers (preferably a 
mixture of interests - are any vendors interested, is DavidW ok with this, 
who is using it now and are the interfaces and designs correct etc etc?)
So I simply cannot make that decision. I don't have the expertise or the 
knowledge. I'll have to trust somebody else for things like this, and it 
should be somebody who isn't "personally involved". 
In other words, I kind of want a sign-off from other parties, because I 
can't pull things like this "blind".
Are there (embedded?) vendors that already integrate this into their 
kernel, or wait for it? Is dwmw supportive of this? Questions, questions..
