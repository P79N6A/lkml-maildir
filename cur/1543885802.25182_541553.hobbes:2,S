We used it (with great success) to replace bad UPSs on single-PSU
database servers under (light) load. No need for scheduled downtime,
etc.
The whole point of hibernation (or suspend to disk, or whatever you
call it) is that the system goes to a zero-power state and then can be
brought back to its original state. Closing in-progress network
connections has nothing to do with pausing a machine any more than
setting IM clients to 'away' would, or locking an X session. That sort
of side-effect needs to be handled outside the core of "put state out
to disk and read it back".
