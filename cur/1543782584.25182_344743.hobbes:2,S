I too did notice that the adm9240 case was worse than the four other
ones back then, but when I tried to get it to crash, it never did.  This
is the reason why I did not push this patch upstream faster.  I wonder
why it now does oops on you.
I also believe that this patch was somewhat misnamed.  It is not related
to the new hwmon class, but jut happened to change the same part of
these five drivers.  With a better name, the patch would most probably
have been selected by Greg in the last batch of i2c patches to Linus.

I wouldn't call it straightforward, but it certainly has been reviewed
and tested well enough by now to be considered safe.

Fine with me.
Thanks,
