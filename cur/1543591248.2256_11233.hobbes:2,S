We do this already with ide-scsi. A device is visible as /dev/hda
and /dev/sda at the same time. Or think IDE-CDRW: /dev/hda,
/dev/sr0 and /dev/sg0.
All at the same time.
It is perfectly normal to export different interfaces for the
same device. This is basically, what subfunctions on PCI do: Same
device with different interfaces. 
Just that we do it through a driver with ide and through the
hardware with a multi function PCI card.
Applications don't care about devices. They care about entities
that have capabilities and programming interfaces. What they
_really_ are and if this is only emulated is not important.
Sorry, I don't see your point here :-(
