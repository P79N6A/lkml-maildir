Right, thats why my question still is why do these iscsi & ocfs  cache 
have this flag set.
If we are sure that the flag is still required, we can use the patch 
below.

Right.
Thanks & Regards,

As pointed by Christoph, there is a problem with SLAB_NO_REAP flag. If set 
then the recovery of objects from alien caches is switched off.
Objects not freed on the same node where they were initially
allocated will only be reused if a certain amount of objects
accumulates from one alien node (not very likely) or if the cache is
explicitly shrunk.
This patch facilitates draining of the alien caches irrespective of the value
of SLAB_NO_REAP flag.
