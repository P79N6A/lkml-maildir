I'm sure you're right; I should have said most of the drivers that 
I'm using (including e100 &e1000).
My impression, though, is that there's a trend to use 
netif_carrier_ok() to check the link in newish drivers (of course, 
it's author-choice, not universal), and that the netif_carrier_ok() 
is generally implemented to be dependent on the interface being 
(logically) up.
It'd be nice if we could define link state reporting to be 
independent of logical up/down state, at least for drivers & devices 
capable of making the distinction.
