The POSIX "minimal" standard is actually very close to what RTL offers
and is what some other "POSIX" rt systems like LynxOs seem to follow.
The "multi" standard includes all the problematical stuff. How useful
would it be to have "minimal" on its own?
I brought up POSIX RT at the RTLinux BOF at LinuxWorld and had absolutely
no interest expressed.
