Since whole bytes are not written, this looks strangely like
an attempt to DMA to cached RAM! Since the CPU didn't write
to RAM, the cache doesn't "know" that somebody wrote to it
so the subsequent read comes from cache, not RAM. Somebody
who knows the KT400 software well, should verify that DMA-able
buffers are being used and the driver isn't writing directly
to a (ultimately) user buffer.
Cheers,
