No. We don't have any hardwares like that here. However, it is trivial
to add a global variable, say
int dma_memory_limit = 1;
to indicate if the architecture has the DMA memory limit and each
architecture can turn it off at the runt-time. We then can do
	if (!dma_memory_limit)
		RMQUEUE_ANY(order);
	else {
		if (gfp_mask & __GFP_DMA)
			RMQUEUE_DMA(order);
		else {
			RMQUEUE_NODMA(order);
			RMQUEUE_ANY(order);
		}
	}

I also use it on 2.2.7.
