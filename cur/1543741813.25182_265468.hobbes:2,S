Wonder no more. All my statistical-wise tests were carried on a UP box (my
laptop), so there's no "ksoftirqd/1" in there, just a single
"ksoftirqd/0".
Speaking of which, I was not taking tests very seriously on my other
SMP/HT box, just because I don't want to rant about it anymore :) Only
recently VP and RT kernels were barely able to boot there, where even
plain vanilla 2.6.9 seems to be snappier and with far fewer xruns than
V0.4.1 or even U3 (either RT or not).
OTOH, on my laptop (P4/UP) I can testify as truth that, at least for
RT-U3, the improvement is real: I don't have a record of such a top
performer, when regarding the zero-xrun, low-latency audio setup
potential. When even compared, it just outperforms by far that old
2.4+preempt+low-latency myth ;)
Unfortunately, this is not what I see on my P4/SMP/HT desktop box. I
cannot tell a lie ;)
Bye now.

P.S. Karsten, my US-224 is working real nice on my laptop now (provided
I'm with RT-U3 :) I'm real thankful for all of your work on snd-usb-usx2y.
Cheers.
