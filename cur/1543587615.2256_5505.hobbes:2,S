Or for 2.5.X you could use EVIOCGKEYCODE or EVIOCSKEYCODE using
/dev/eventX. Also the input api supports up to 220 different keys and
could support up to 255. If you app needs to use a large keycode space
then use this instead. Its better to use this interface especially
for embedded systems that have only a serial console, but sometimes
we need to use a regular keyboard. Consider for example a hand held iPAQ.
Usually their is no keyboard attached. Here you have a graphical interface
(using framebuffer) and a touch screen. So here I like to have a kernel
that uses fbdev without the VT console system and input drivers to
interface with the device. Debugging can be done by the serial console.
If I attach a keyboard I like to be able to use it without having to have
a console system needing to be built in. Remember every byte of space
counts. Getting keycode via the console layer should eventually be
replaced by this approach.

renders the sufferer barely able to perform the simplest task. 2. A disease.
