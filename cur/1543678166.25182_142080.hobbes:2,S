maybe.
for some reason, this looks almost like a re-engineering of the DEC
hardware tree... node>nexus>bus>device>unit thing. Node was the specific
host (ie, could be a cluster). Nexus was the specific bus adapter on the
system backplane in the host (there could be more than one IO nexus 
controller) Bus was the specific type of bus controller attached to the nexus
(one or more, I vaguely remember a maixmum of 2 - BI or UNIBUS), device (the
device controller attached to the bus - disk tape/terminal/network/..) and
the unit number assigned to the hardware. There was at least one more level
for disk/tape/terminal units attached.
Which was also redone in IRIX a few years ago to support connect/disconnect
of SCSI devices and controllers. Then redone again to be able to power down
different levels for hot plugging/replacement.
I still hope that they do work it out, since it will almost certainly be
more efficient than what was done on the Vax system.
