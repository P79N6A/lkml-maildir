An updated version of this scheduler is now available for 2.6.7-rc3 at:
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/patch-2_6_7_rc3-SPA-v0.1>
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/patch-2_6_7_rc3-SPA_IAB-v0.1>
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/patch-2_6_7_rc3-SPA_TPB-v0.1>
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/patch-2_6_7_rc3-SPA_TSTATS-v0.1>
These patches should be applied in the order that they are listed.
Also, as promised, the first of these patches has been unified with the 
staircase scheduler and a patch that implements the staircase scheduler 
on top of the first of the above patches is available at:
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/patch-2_6_7_rc3-SPA_STAIRCASE-v0.1>
This scheduler is functionally equivalent to Con Kolivas's v6.4 
scheduler except that a promotion feature (that will trigger very 
infrequently probably never :-)) has been added.  This was added 
because, although it is extremely unlikely, starvation is possible with 
the staircase scheduler and this feature removes that possibility.
