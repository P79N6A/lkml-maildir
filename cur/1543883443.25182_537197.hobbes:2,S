There's an ARM category in the kernel.org bugzilla.  Folk are completely
free to submit ARM bugs to either the (closed) mailing list or bugzilla.
99.99999999% of bug reports in the ARM community come via the mailing
list.  I think to date there's been about 10 bugzilla entries since
Feb 2004.
This is inspite of me linking to the kernel.org bugzilla from my
website.
So it seems that virtually all the folk involved with the ARM kernel,
given a completely free choice, _prefer_ to send email-based bug
reports over touching bugzilla.
That's quite a different metric to projects forcing bugzilla on people,
and I'd say is a more valid metric to gauge whether bugzilla is really
suitable.
