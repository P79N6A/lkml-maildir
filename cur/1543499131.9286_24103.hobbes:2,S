Since patches are usually generated from outside the linux dir, that's
where I like to be...  This is what I use, which is basically "shut up
and be clean unless there's an error"
	$ bzcat ~/download/kernel/linux-2.2.9.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
	$ # 'linux' is now subdir of current dir
	$ bzcat ~/download/kernel/patch-2.2.10.bz2 | patch -sp0
Patch option '-E' is normally unnecessary I think.
