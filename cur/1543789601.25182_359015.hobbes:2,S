 		High Precision Event Timer Driver for Linux
 
-The High Precision Event Timer (HPET) hardware is the future replacement for the 8254 and Real
-Time Clock (RTC) periodic timer functionality.  Each HPET can have up two 32 timers.  It is possible
-to configure the first two timers as legacy replacements for 8254 and RTC periodic.  A specification
-done by INTEL and Microsoft can be found at 
http://www.intel.com/labs/platcomp/hpet/hpetspec.htm.

-The driver supports detection of HPET driver allocation and initialization of the HPET before the
-driver module_init routine is called.  This enables platform code which uses timer 0 or 1 as the
-main timer to intercept HPET initialization.  An example of this initialization can be found in
