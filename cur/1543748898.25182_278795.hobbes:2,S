AFAIK, adjtimex() [ntp_gettime()] is expected is expected to return those. As long 
as all those are simply zero, you might optimize that case. However once you want 
PPS processing you'll have to add them back. However there's little use in:
1) Declaring variables as extern if you don't use them
2) Do external declarations out side an include file [might introduce conflicting 
external declaration]
