All modules show up today in /sys/module/ no matter if they are built
into the kernel or not.
But, if they are built as a module, the /sys/module/drivers/ link was
present.  This is not consistant, as we always want to see that link, no
matter if the driver is built in or not.  So with this change, we now
always see the links.
I also fixed the PCI and USB drivers to do this as well.
Hope this helps explain it.
thanks,
