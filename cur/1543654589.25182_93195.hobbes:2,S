I spoke too fast. Just after sending the e-mail, I kept reading the
mailing-list within mutt while compiling sane-backends and it locked up.
It's the first time I try kmsgdump, which comes included in -aa, I
dumped the info to a FAT12 disk. Yet the messages.txt I found on the
disk shows nothing.
I attach it anyway, just in case, since it is 16384 bytes in size but
doubt it'll be of any use.
How else can I take down the kernel dump without any additional computer
at hand? I'd prefer not having to write it down, ... but I'll do it if
there's no other way.
