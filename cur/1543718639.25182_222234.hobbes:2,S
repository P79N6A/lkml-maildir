Hi Sebastian,
Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  My usual googling of smartmontools
didn't turn this up because you changed the subject line and started a new
thread.  You wrote:

I hadn't realized until now that the drive is an IBM GXP60.
smartctl is *supposed* to print a warning message for these drives, to
tell users to look at 
http://www.geocities.com/dtla_update/index.html#rel
for pointers to updated firmware for this drive!  What firmware version do
you have?
If you do smartctl -P showall, you'll see that there is the following
entry -- but the regular expression doesn't match your drive because of
the '-0' and '-1' suffix (which usually indicates RAM cache size of the
disk drive).  I'll do a bit of research and then probably modify the
smartmontools regular expression to be sure to recognize the drive.
MODEL REGEXP:       IC35L0[12346]0AVER07
FIRMWARE REGEXP:    .*
ATTRIBUTE OPTIONS:  None preset; no -v options are required.
WARNINGS:           IBM Deskstar 60GXP drives may need upgraded SMART
firmware. Please see 
http://www.geocities.com/dtla_update/index.html#rel
Meanwhile, what firmware version do you have?  I suggest you upgrade it --
this may fix the problem.  The final firmware with the SMART fixes seems
to be A46A.
Cheers,
	Bruce
