Yep, just that "swapped out"/"swappin in" can be though of as "read
in/"read out".

With the patch minor faults are only those faults which can be serviced
by the pagecache, requiring no I/O.
Pages which hit the first time in cache due to readahead _have_ caused
IO, and as such they should be counted as major faults.
I suppose that if you want to count readahead hits it should be done
separately (which is now "sort of" available with the "majflt" field).
