The pm timer is very fast when the timer is latched and that strange loop uses 
hardly any cpu time. The same can't be said about the unlatched timer case 
where absurd amounts of cpu seem the norm. You have a catch 22 situation if 
you depend on the accuracy of the pm timer only to end up wasting time trying 
to actually use that timer. 
Currently if you compile in pmtimer it is used by default. Perhaps when it's 
detected that the timer is unlatched it should actually be used as a last 
resort when all other timers have failed or it has been specified by 
bootparam rather than the default timer. I figured having separate functions 
for latched and unlatched timers would make more sense so that hardware with 
good timers aren't unfairly disadvantaged by reading the time 2 more times 
than necessary.
Cheers,
