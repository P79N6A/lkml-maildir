randomizing PIE's is as a whole worth getting right and in mainline.
That means that ONLY the PIE text should be randomized, not that mmap
should break ;)
Randomizing address space is very widely recognized as being part of a
whole set of things (and there's a lot of discussion about what that
whole set should be, each vendor will say their solution should be part
of that and that all others suck) that you need to do to make it a LOT
harder to get a general purpose exploit working. (It's not fool proof;
it's more comparable than a 4 tumble number lock than it is to a iris
scan; yet even a tumble number lock makes it harder to break into your
gym locker)
