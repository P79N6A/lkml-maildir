I think we're actually in what the IETF sometimes calls 'violent agreement' -
what I meant was that if a misconfigured /etc/fstab marked a file system
as 'swap', then even if it survived the 'mkswap', the subsequent swapping
would finish the job...
But as you noted in an earlier posting, having the metadata in cleartext
so sys_swapon can tell what's going on and skipping the mkswap entirely is
a better solution..

"Linux is designed to give you enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot with" ;)
I'll let somebody else worry about how paranoid mkswap should be before
requiring a -f flag.

Yes, that does sound like a sane idea, and also addresses at least *most* of
the issues with swsusp and swap not stepping on each other's toes (as the
header is in cleartext so they both can read it). That still leaves the
swsusp crew having to save their key securely - but that's easily done if
you have cryptoapi handy.  Only ugly part is having to read a passphrase
from the keyboard at suspend and resume (trying to implement "suspend on
close lid" gets.. ummm.. interesting ;)
