I am creating a link list of free objects per cpu. When objects are
deallocated by the caller they get added to its cpu free object link
list.  The freed objects do not migrate to other caches, they are put
back to the present cpu's link list. so they don't have to be
re-initialized.  I am planning on putting a (configurable) limit on
the number of free objects that can stay in a free list.

No I am using the object(beginning space) to store the links. When
allocated, I can initialize the space occupied by the link address.
