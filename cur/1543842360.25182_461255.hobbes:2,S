I've already specified the changes on ARM, and suggested a fix for
them - but that got poo-poo'd.  I said:

So the effective code changes you ask for are: "multiple calls to
standard library functions that would not otherwise be made without
-ffreestanding".
Hence, for -ffreestanding to be acceptable to me, we need to fix
linux/string.h _first_.  That's really all I'm asking for but apparantly
that's too much to ask for.
It's not realistic to post the actual code changes because virtually every
line is different - due to differences in the register allocation caused
by the variations in code generation.  Hence, to compare it properly it's
a painstaking line by line read of each to understand what's going on and
manual compare.
