I know this is maybe stupid, but...
At the beggining of sched.c, this commentary appears:
/*
 * 'sched.c' is the main kernel file. It contains scheduling primitives
 * (sleep_on, wakeup, schedule etc) as well as a number of simple system
 * call functions (type getpid()), which just extract a field from
 * current-task
 */
Shouldn't be ommited the last part ? It has several system calls, but
sys_getpid is in timer.c, not in sched.c.
