This code is not called during normal pagefaults and even during invalid
userspace accesses.
Out of curiosity, I inserted printk() at this place to see where I was
wrong. I got only two hits:
	Checking if this processor honours the WP bit even in supervisor mode... do_page_fault:
	Freeing unused kernel memory: 116k freed
	do_page_fault:
Resume: nobody gives a fuck about performance of this particular if,
	so conversion it totally pointless.
