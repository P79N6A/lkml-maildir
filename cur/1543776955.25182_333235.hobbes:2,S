It also carries with it the stigma of "kernel debugging", which I just
don't see production system maintainers liking very much.
So tell you what, how about if we merged what's in debugfs into relayfs
instead? We'll still end up with one filesystem, but we'll have a more
inocuous name. After all, if debugfs is indeed for dumping data from the
kernel to user-space for different usages, then relaying is what it's
actually doing, right?
