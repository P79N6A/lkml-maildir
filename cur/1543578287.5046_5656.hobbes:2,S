Hi all,
As I just found out, Linux 2.4.1-pre1 breaks several things on
my system that worked perfectly in 2.4.0-final and the entire
2.4.0-ac tree.
XFree 4.2.0 now fails to detect monitor timings and therefore
removes all modelines and bails out. The relevant diff of the
X logfile follows. Note the "nan" bits.

Moreover, with 2.4.1-pre1 the "w" command behaves in mysterious ways:
Normal output is something like:
USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU  WHAT
root     tty1     -                 2:23pm  4:41   0.03s  0.03s  -bash  
With 2.4.1-pre1 things look like:
USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU  WHAT
root     tty1     -                 2:21pm   ?     0.2147483648s  0.01s  w
I'm not sure I need it so precise :-)
Since the 2.4.1-pre1 patch is rather small, it shouldn't be too hard
to hunt down the part that causes these oddities.
Regards,
Udo.
