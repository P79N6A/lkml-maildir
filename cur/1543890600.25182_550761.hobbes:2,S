After Daniel refined this testing program, we can see that perf gain
is < 2% which can surely be accounted to cleanups like unnecessary
castings in tight loops.
Again, all the original code has been retained _as-is_. Whatever was
changed, has been mentioned in that detailed changelog that I post
along with patch.
If someone want to review these 500 lines with this changelog in hand,
it should not take more than couple of hours. If no-one can see any
problem in code by now and considering that it's tested on x86(_32),
amd64, ppc and giving somewhat better perf. than original then I
believe it is unnecessarily hanging outside of -mm tree.
I also contacted author (Markus Oberhumer) regarding above changes but
he seems not be responding right now. But still, if it gets into -mm
and gets used by various related projects then it should be good
enough for mainline also.
Cheers,
Nitin
