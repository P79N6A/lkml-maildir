There is a real easy way to filter the spam out.
Prefilter the list and drop anything that does not have "linux-kernel" in the
To: or Cc: header lines.  99% of all spam is Bcc:ed.  This simple filter kills
amazing mounts of spam and leaves your list sparkling clean!
I have tested this on the perl5-porters list and it works very well.  (With the
exception of mail coming through perl-bug, but that is another rant.)
