Subject: [BUG sparc64] 2.6.22-rc broke X on Ultra5

Just a FYI:
2.6.21 works fine on my Ultra5, but with 2.6.22-rc the X
server (from Aurora 2) fails to mmap() the PCI frame buffer
(atyfb).
I noticed a lot of PCI-related changes both in `dmesg' and
/var/log/Xorg.0.log between 2.6.21 and 2.6.22-rc, so my
guess is that PCI resources get broken somewhere.
I'll try a bisect between 2.6.21 and 2.6.22-rc1 next, but
I'm also willing to test patches in case anyone thinks they
know what the fix is.
