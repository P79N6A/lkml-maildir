This looks like a good thing to do with or without the problem. Minimizing
the time that a lock is held is usually a good idea.

Clever. (I think the second xchg() can just be atomic_set()) Without actually
playing with it, it looks good to me.
If the problem is too hard to solve - it isn't that bad if one can't
epoll recursively. If the functionality was added later, it is
doubtful that the API itself would need to change.
