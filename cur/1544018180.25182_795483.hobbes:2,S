kbuild has never (at least for a very long time) not
supported to implement a module only in assembler.
So you will have no luck trying to build the
module rtc_hrw.ko
What you can do is to define a module like htis:
obj-m := dick.o
dick-y := rtc.o rtc_hwr.o
This will properly build rtc_hwr.S => rtc_hwr.o
