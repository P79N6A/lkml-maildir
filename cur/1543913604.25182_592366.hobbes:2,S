Hello,
This is my situation:
  - I mounted the pseudo cpuset filesystem into /dev/cpuset
  - I created a cpuset named oar with my 2 cpus
cat /dev/cpuset/oar/cpus 
0-1
  - Then I hibernate my computer with 'echo -n "disk" >/sys/power/state'
  - After reboot:
cat /dev/cpuset/oar/cpus 
0
Why did I lost a cpu?
Is this a normal behavior???
Thank you for your attention,
Nicolas Capit
