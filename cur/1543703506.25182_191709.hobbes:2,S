Subject: Announce: Software Suspend Core Patch 2.0 rc4.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/1/16/225

including urls might be nice.
also the feature comparison webpage
does not mention bios at all.
Till now I used SOFTWARE_SUSPEND because
it works fine, whereas PM_DISK somehow uses the 
bios, and does not work (dell latitude c600,
I don't have that magic partition the dell bios
expects).
SWSUSP2 will be like SWSUSP concerning this issue?
regards, Andreas
