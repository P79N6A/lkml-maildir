I'm currently of the opinion that dm needs a raid5 and raid6 module 
added, then the user land lvm tools fixed to use them, and then you 
could use dm instead of md.  The benefit being that dm pushes things 
like volume autodetection and management out of the kernel to user space 
where it belongs.  But that's just my opinion...
I'm using dm at home because I have a sata hardware fakeraid raid-0 
between two WD 10,000 rpm raptors, and the dmraid utility correctly 
recognizes that and configures device mapper to use it.
