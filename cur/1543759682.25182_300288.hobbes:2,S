So actually it's really mostly one-way traffic, ie in the download direction.
Anything significant at all going upstream, other than ACKs, etc?

With regard to this note in the 'man 7 socket' man page:
NOTES
        Linux assumes that half of the send/receive buffer is used for internal kernel struc-
        tures; thus the sysctls are twice what can be observed on the wire.
What value are you using for the sockopt call?

My application is single-threaded, uses non-blocking IO, and sends/rcvs from/to memory.
It will be a good test of the TCP stack, but will not use the sendfile logic,
nor will it touch the HD.

I can emulate delay if I need to, but I'd rather just stick with one
delay setting and not have to set up a separate delay for each connection.
Maybe 30ms is average for round-trip time?
Have you tried benchmarking your app in a controlled manner, or are you just
letting a random 3000 machines hit it and start downloading?  If the latter,
then I'd suggest getting more controll over your testing environment, otherwise
it may be impossible to really figure out where the problem lies.
I'll set up a configuration similar to the values discussed above and see
what I can see.  Will probably be late tomorrow before I can do the
test though...
