I've tested the latest zc patch on:
3c905   (10b7/9050)
3c905B  (10b7/9055)
3c905C  (10b7/9200)
3c590   (10b7/5900)
no problems.  I simply mounted an NFS server with rsize=wsize=8192
and read a few files - I assume this is sufficient?
I can test a 3c575 later today.
What I suggest we do here is to add a new flag to the per-device
table `HAS_HWCKSM' and use that to set the device capabilities,
rather than using the IS_CYCLONE stuff.  Then we can add cards
individually as confirmation comes in.
I do have a 200-line 3c59x patch banked up - it does the following:
- fixes some interface selection problems with 3c590/3c900's
- fixes a PAGE_SIZE memory leak which occurs each time the
  driver is unloaded (pci_free_consistent needed).
- fixes the 3c556B's PM-resume behaviour
So...  How to coordinate these diffs?  I'd propose that I implement
the HAS_HWCKSM thing, test zerocopy with it on the five NICs which
I have.  Then what?  Ask Linus to merge the non-zc parts?
