I'm not against the patch (although --file to --file-force parameter change
seems unnecessary and the warning should be toned down) but I think that
cleanup patches have been demonized out of proportion recently on LKML.

Seconded, also if this is what people like to work on we shouldn't be trying
to stop them but point them into the direction where their work could be more
productive in "the big picture" context.

OTOH there is a lot of old/legacy code that almost nobody is touching where
cleanup would be appreciated (it is quite likely that somebody will notice
and fix a bug or two in the process).

Agreed but we sometimes accept per file whitespace cleanups.
The important thing here is "common sense".  Sending a big patch series
of "checkpatch.pl fixes" for kernel/* files is certainly not a good thing.
Core code has a lot of high-profile people looking over it so you will be
just interfering with their changes.
However if somebody do such fixes for some old/orphaned driver _and_ also
fix other things at the same time then everything is sweet from my POV. :)
Thanks,
