I am not sure if this is a valid test for preemptableness (word?), but 
I started a kernel thread in init/main.c for spind:
void spind(void)
{
  unsigned int spinner;
  for(spinner=1;;spinner++)
    if(spinner==0){
      printk("wrapped\n");
    }
}
Console showed a steady stream of "wrapped" and didn't make any other
progress.
I have the bottom half handler running as a kernel thread on another
box and it doesn't seem to have any trouble - but that chunk of code
is structured to sleep on a semaphore until the scheduler wakes it
up (ie the bh handler volunteers to give up the cpu when it figures 
it has done enough - no preemption required.)  I will eventually be 
getting to the question of whether bottom halves can handle being 
preempted.  I kind of expected the box to crash but it ran under
heavy load for 48 hours.  I would have to guess then that the semantics 
of kernel_thread are such that I effectively "did nothing" by 
stuffing the bottom half handler into its own thread.
learning slowly...
