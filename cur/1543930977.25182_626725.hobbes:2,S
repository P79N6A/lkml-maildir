Calling libselinux means it's a special case for a specific LSM.
I think the best way to do this, then, has to be to dlopen the appropriate LSM
library.  That way I don't need to do any conditional compilation or linking,
but can build all the bits in to cachefilesd and have the appropriate one
selected by the /etc/cachefilesd.conf.
So, what do I invoke in libselinux, how do I configure it, and how do I
integrate the config into my RPM and install it?
And then what does it give me that I can hand to the kernel (a context string
for SELinux, I presume), how do I get the kernel to make a check on it, how do
I configure the check and how do I install that config from my RPM (I presume
I just need to modify the .fc, .if and .te files that I have already)?

Whilst that's a fair point, if it's in a config file somewhere, then someone
may want to change it or someone may want to provide a second file for a
second cache with a different security label.

Aargh.  In which case it might not be possible to make the SELinux context
passing from userspace -> kernel generic for all LSMs:-(
