Hello
Is there a method to stack signals? i.e when multiple signals are delivered 
to the process, instead of being 1 shot, that signals get delivered as many
times?
and from kernel mode, can we pass arguments in the signal handler? for eg:
if i have SIGUSR1 for each
signal delivered by the kernel, i would like to pass some special parameter
to the signal handler.?
