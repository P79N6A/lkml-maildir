We already have that - the reboot handler, acpi S4 support and the sysfs
interface. This should have been asked when sysfs was added :>. For the
sake of backwards compatibility for current suspend2 users, it should
stay for a while at least. The other thing here is that there is much
more to /proc/software_suspend than do_resume.

Just because the kernel does very little, that doesn't mean it should.
Particularly for something like suspend to disk, where it's not just a
matter of an oops but of potential hard disk corruption, this is
important.
If I could do it in userspace, I would. The trouble is, the userspace
app may not be there to tell the user what is happening, and this might
be part of the problem.
