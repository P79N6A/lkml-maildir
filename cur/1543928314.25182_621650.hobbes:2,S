Possible. So far I have not seen a hardware setup that would force
interrupts to cpu #0 in legacy mode.  But I would not be truly
surprised if it happened that there was hardware that only worked that
way.

    (Do not use legacy mode in the kdump kernel. removing it from shutdown
     is just minor optimization)

Exactly.  If we can work out the details that should be a much more reliable
mode of operation.

My real problem was the failure case was obscure (a bad interaction
with ACPI on Linus's laptop) and I didn't have the time to track it
down when it showed up.
My patch had two parts.  Some cleanups to enable the code to be enabled
early, and the actually early enable.  I figure if we can get the
cleanups in one major kernel version and then in the next enable
the apic mode before we start getting interrupts we should be in good
shape.
I expect with x86 becoming an embedded platform with multiple cpus we
may start seeing systems that don't actually support legacy PIC mode
for interrupt delivery.
