Not really much different, it's no different than other paths like
getblk (when you swap on top of the fs) and brw_page (OTOH we have a
little reserved shared pool for the async bh needed by brw_page but it's not
math accurate first of all because it's shared for the other pagecache
I/O too), it just increases a little the mem pressure when there's
a transfer function involved and the translation cannot be done in
place, but I obviously agree that such loop deadlock needs fixing
reagardless if it's easy to reproduce it or not :). Infact I think I
mentioned such deadlock in the past too.

Yes, thanks.
