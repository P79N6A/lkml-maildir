I'm working on it in the DJ tree. I'm going from the lowest level up to
the tty layer. I agree with about the BKL. I plan to move
acquire_console_lock into the tty lock shortly. No reason that only the VT
system should be able to take advantage of it. I also plan to implement
that lock on a per hardware device level instead of a general global lock. 
This will solve alot of problems. Plus their is no reason why serial
devices or VT tty system have to reimplement the wheel.
