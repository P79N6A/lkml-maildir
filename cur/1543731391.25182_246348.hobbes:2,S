Subject: [RFC][PATCH] fix target_cpus() for summit subarch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've been hunting down a bug affecting IBM x440/x445 systems where the
floppy driver would get spurious interrupts and would not initialize
properly. 
After digging James Cleverdon pointed out that target_cpus() is routing
the interrupts to the clustered apic broadcast mask. This was causing
multiple interrupts to show up, breaking the floppy init code. 
This one-liner fix simply routes interrupts to the first cpu to resolve
this issue.
Any comments or feedback would be appreciated.
thanks
