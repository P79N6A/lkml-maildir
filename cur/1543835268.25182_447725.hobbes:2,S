One of my main kevent benchmarks (socket notifications for
accept/receive) is handmade http server.
I compared it with FreeBSD kqueue, epoll and kevent_poll
(this is generic poll/select notifications ported to kevent)
based (it is the same server but with different event functions.
Client was httperf, I ran it with 30k connections in bursts of 3k
connection with 1 second timeout between bursts.
Here are results:
kevent:	more than 2600 requests/second
epoll and kevent_poll: about 1600-1800 requests/second
kqueue: enormous number of connection reset errors (only 62% of
successfull connections) (likely misconfiguration, default FreeBSD
6-something does not allow such rates at all).
