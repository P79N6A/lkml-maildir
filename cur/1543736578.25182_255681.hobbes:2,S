Yes, I have reproduced the problem on another machine running a similar kernel but with different network card, CPU, etc.

  Hello,

  I don't have personaly much experience with debugging by above tools
so I won't be of much help. As you describe the problem below I
personaly think that you won't get much from them if the system is as
unresponsive as you write.

  Hmm.. that looks bad. Do you debug things under console and not
in X? If that is the case either there is some hardware problem (you
likely generate quite high load on the machine) or some driver is stuck
with interrupts disabled. In case debugging tools don't help you can try
to compile kernel with minimal config (just disable everything not
needed to run the test). Also reproducing on a different machine would
be useful to rule out hardware...
