This is because of the flex mmap patch for x86-64.  You can try the following 
workaround from Andi Kleen:
diff -u linux-2.6.10rc1-mm3/kernel/sysctl.c-o 
linux-2.6.10rc1-mm3/kernel/sysctl.c
--- linux-2.6.10rc1-mm3/kernel/sysctl.c-o	2004-11-05 11:42:00.000000000 +0100
+++ linux-2.6.10rc1-mm3/kernel/sysctl.c	2004-11-06 13:50:22.000000000 +0100
