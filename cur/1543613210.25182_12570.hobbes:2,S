correct.

Going into the differences between icache/dcache and pagecache would
been too low level (and I should have spent some time explaining what
icache and dcache are first ;), so as you noticed I intentionally
ignored those highlevel vfs caches in the slides. The concept of "pages
of cache" is usually well known by most people instead, so I only
considered the pagecache, that incidentally is also the most interesting
case for the VM.  For seasoned kernel developers it would been
interesting to integrate more stuff, of course, but as you said this is
a start at least :).
About the icache/dcache shrinking, that's probably the most rough thing
we have in the vm at the moment. It just works.
