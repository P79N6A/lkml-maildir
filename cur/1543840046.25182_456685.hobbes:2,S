Yes, after discussion with Rusty, it appears that beefing up 
stop_machine_run is the right way to go.  And it has benefits for 
non-paravirt code as well, such as allowing plug-in kprobes or oprofile 
extension modules to be loaded without having to deal with a debug 
exception or NMI during module load/unload.
