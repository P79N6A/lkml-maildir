I finally got fdutils to almost work.
BUT, when was the kernels floppy.c reworked such that it needs
special patching to handle a floppy format that uses sector zero? 
There is a patch, but its for the floppy.c in 2.6.4 and thats a
vintage kernel itself today.  And it won't apply to recent kernels,
been there, done that.
That emasculates it so bad that half the vintage computer formats are
disabled.  Dumb...
