Umm. Does anybody actually have any performance numbers? 
The thing is, those things are *cheap* compared to the IO. And any 
high-performance device will be using DMA for the real IO, so we're not 
generally even talking about any performance-critical stuff. 
Quite frankly, if performance is a _real_ reason to avoid 
ioread*/iowrite*, I'll happily accept read*/write*, but it would be needed 
to be backed up by real numbers. Can you even measure it?
I would definitely *not* encourage the notion that people should use 
readl/writel because of "performance reasons". That may be valid for some 
fbcon driver, but those drivers go to other extremes (ie they use 
"__raw_writel()" etc, and MTRR's etc).
If you don't use write-combining memory regions, the performance argument 
is not really valid.
