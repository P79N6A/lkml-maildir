I did a bit of a look and didn't find any mention of the subject for 
drives using contact start/stop. I did find mention that the unload 
torque needed is quite a bit higher on load/unload systems, so I would 
imagine that having to extract or store that energy for emergency 
unloads would be more of a demanding task and might be a rougher process.
Just judging from the sound, though, hard power-offs on a desktop 
Seagate Barracuda 7200.10, for example, which is contact start/stop, 
don't really sound any different from a commanded standby. On the laptop 
drives I've seen you can really tell the difference.
