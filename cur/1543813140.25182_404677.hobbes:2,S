local_t maps onto 32-bit values on 32-bit machines and onto 64-bit values
on 64-bit machines.  unsigned longs.  I don't quite trust the signedness
handling across all archs.

Yes, alpha (for example) went and made its local_t's signed, which is wrong
and dangerous.
ia64 is signed.
mips is signed.
parisc is signed.
s390 is signed.
sparc64 is signed.
x86_64 is signed 32-bit!
All other architectures use unsigned long.  A fiasco.
Once decrapify-asm-generic-localh.patch is merged I think all architectures
can and should use asm-generic/local.h.
Until decrapify-asm-generic-localh.patch has been merged and the downstream
arch consolidation has happened and the signedness problems have been
carefully reviewed and fixed I wouldn't go within a mile of local_t.
Once all that is sorted out then yes, it makes sense to convert per-cpu
counters to local_t.  Note that local_t is unsigned, and percpu_counter
needs to treat it as signed.
We should also move the out-of-line percpu_counter implementation over to
lib/something.c (in obj-y).
But none of that has anything to do with these patches.
