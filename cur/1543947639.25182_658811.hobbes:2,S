So I'm missing a lot of the background here.
I don't think "sys_open()" is in any way preferable to the alternatives, 
especially since it depends on thread-global state (the file descriptor 
table) rather than much more local state ("struct file" that you've 
opened).
I think the calls to sys_open() in init do_dounts etc are very different: 
they really are more about a real kernel-level almost-user-mode thread 
than a core driver. 
I *also* think this patch is just fundamentally broken regardless. You 
can't just cast a kernel pointer to (char __user *). The two can be in 
totally different address spaces. There's a reason why it used to do that 
whole dance with oldfs.
[ Of course, on platforms where ACPI actually runs this is not the case, 
  but that is not an excuse for doing things wrong ]
So I would NAK this patch - it looks buggy, and the reason for it is not 
sufficiently explained in the first place.
