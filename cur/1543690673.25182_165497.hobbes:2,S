Or an embedded system, maybe?
At the end of the day, it still means loosing a tiny amount of
performance just to make it easier for distributions to have one
generic kernel.  There is nothing wrong with that, but why force it on
systems that are not running a generic kernel?
What's wrong with:
#ifdef CONFIG_MMIO
	writel(... );
        readl(... );
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_NO_MMIO
	outl(... );
	inl(...);
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_DONT_CARE_MMIO
	if (dev->mmio) {	
		writel(... );
		readl(... );
	} else {
		outl(... );
		inl(... );
	}
#endif
Although I'm dubious of having a global switch for MMIO anyway.

It's neater, but still means bloat, however small.
I know we're talking a few bytes here and there, but embedded systems
really care about them.
