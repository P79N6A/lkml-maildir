Sounds simlar to the problems i'm having with the channels resetting 
under heavy load, and then fudging DMA, and i'm not the only one havign 
these issues, seems its a common problem with these cards, not sure if 
theres been some slight changes in the chip itself or wether there is a 
fault with the kernel driver, as you say, it seems that the problem does 
not occour under windows.
