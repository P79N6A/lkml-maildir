Subject: Fix for non-booting Alpha with BRIDGE_OTHER device

I found by an experiment that an Alpha with a device which provides
its own PCI bridge, and if that device is on a PCI bus 0, will stop
booting right after "Partition check" messages.  The only way out is
through a power switch.  One can still boot if the device in question
is plugged in a slot on a PCI bus 1.
That particular hardware which revealed the problem is in fact SCI
board from Scali ( 
http://www.scali.com
 ) used in a cluster
communication and Scali provides a fix which makes machines bootable
again.
Here it is recreated against linux-2.2.18pre6.  It will actually
apply to a wide range of kernels but with a possible line offsets
noise.

It indeed makes possible to boot regardles of a slot with SCI in it and
in tests on various Alphas _without_ that device does not seem to harm
anything - which is not a big surprise as otherwise PCMCIA would likely
be a problem too.:-)  Any comments from those who sleep with PCI specs
under pillows?  Should not that be included into standart kernels?
In arch/sparc64/kernel/psycho.c exists already a code which seems to
be somewhat related.
