That's something which worries me. So far my Linux kernel work is not related
to my daytime job at Sony. Sony is big, and it's impossible for me to find out
whether someone at Sony is working on BK competition. I guess the same is true
for other large companies with multiple hands that don't know what the other
hands are doing...

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
