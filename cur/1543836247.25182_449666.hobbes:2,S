Specifically, how a swaping system determine which page should be
swapped out when memory is tight? Intuitively, I think inode cache
pages should be swapped out as late as possible. But how Linux mkae
decision on this? Why linux does not pin inode pages in the memory?
Thanks in advance for kind help!
