Unfortunately that re-introduces another existing unfixed problem. The
N_TTY layer echoes bytes back up the stack into the drivers which are in
hangup state.
I did try calling the set_tty_ldisc but not every driver in that
situation then did the right thing and I got stuck ttys too. I think
that is fixed but 2.6.9rc4 was a bit tight. 
If you want to do the tty_ldisc_set then add a "nulldisc" that just eats
anything it is fed and EOF's anything the other direction. That
would avoid the driver reflect crash I suspect.
