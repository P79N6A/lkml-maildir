Subject: Unresponiveness of 2.4.16

2.4.16 becomes very unresponsive for 30 seconds or so at a time during
large unarchiving of tarballs, like tar -zxf mozilla-src.tar.gz. The
file is about 36mb. I run top in one window, run free repeatedly in
another window and run the tar -zxf in a third window. I had many
suspects, but still not sure what it is. I have tried
ext2 vs ext3
preemptive vs non-preemptive
tainted vs non-tainted
Nothing seems to help 2.4.16.
I tried switching to Redhat's 2.4.9-13 kernel and it acts Alot better.
Not only does 2.4.9-13 not get the 30 second delay, but it also seems to
take advantage of caching. 2.4.16 takes the same moment of time each
time, even tho it should have cached it all into memory the first time.
2.4.9-13 takes a while the first time(without the 30 second new process
freezing), but then takes almost no time the times after that. One
interesting thing I noticed is that with and without preemptive a
already started mp3 playing had no disruption even during the 30 second
windows where any new commands would get stuck with 2.4.16. I am not
using custom
I plan to do more testing to see how say 2.4.9, 2.4.13ac7, etc. 
Any ideas of how to fix this for 2.4.16?
I have attached my .config.
