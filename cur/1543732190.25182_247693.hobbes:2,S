Hi Geert,
I see from
http://linux-m68k-cvs.apia.dhs.org/~geert/linux-m68k-2.6.x-merging/
that you're merging patches back into Linus' kernel.  Great!
I noticed today that Linus's m68k kernel can't be built (at least with gcc-3.4.1).
The first problem I ran into,
   CC      arch/m68k/kernel/asm-offsets.s
   In file included from include/linux/spinlock.h:12,
                  from include/linux/capability.h:45,
                  from include/linux/sched.h:7,
                  from arch/m68k/kernel/asm-offsets.c:12:
   include/linux/thread_info.h:30: error: parse error before '{' token
is solved already in the m68k tree.
(In particular,
the #ifndef __HAVE_THREAD_FUNCTIONS ... #endif in
http://linux-m68k-cvs.apia.dhs.org/c/cvsweb/linux/include/linux/thread_info.h?rev=1.5;content-type=text
%2Fplain
probably solves it.)
There are other problems after that.
Any chance you could spend a bit of time sending Linus enough
patches for his kernel to build for m68k, if not run?
It would be helpful to my crosstool project (I'm adding a
"can this toolchain build the kernel" test, and it's a lot
easier if I can count on the kernel.org tree at least building).
Thanks,
Dan
