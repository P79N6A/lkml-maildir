IMO it would probably be better for you two if all bugs without "real" 
owners had bugs assigned to notaperson@bugzilla.kernel.org, or something 
like that.  That will not only ease useless emails sent to you and 
Martin and other admins, but also make it easier for kernel hackers to 
figure out which bugs are _really_ unassigned and need owners.
