Sure, it is possible to keep up, but if something is constantly 
updating then surely it is better to put that in userspace? That way if 
I buy a new (not currently supported) keyboard, all as I have to do is 
to update the userspace text file, and everything works. If it is in 
the kernel, then I have to upgrade my kernel, and for many users, this 
is not a trivial task. Indeed, for many users this then causes support 
issues (think enterprise distributions).
Just my thoughts,
Paul
