I would probably write
   ( a ? b : c ) = d;
instead, having learned C when some compilers parsed ? wrong without 
parens. Actually I can't imagine writing that at all, but at least with 
parens humans can read it easily. Ugly code.
Your suggestion is not portable, if b or c are declared "register" there 
are compilers which will not allow taking the address, and gcc will give 
you a warning.
