Waste the disk. You'll waste it anyway, once you start to compile and
by that time, the temporary tar is deleted.

*I* don't have any of those problems. But it is good to know that you
are concerned about me. :)

Agreed, that would be a problem.

Malicious packages should be rare enough to ignore the showstopper

Yup, I'm convinced. signatures for plain tars would still be a nice
thing to have, but they cannot replace those for .gz and .bz2.
