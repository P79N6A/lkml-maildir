Subject: [PATCH] signals: cleanup the usage of print_fatal_signal()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Move the callsite of print_fatal_signal() down, under
"if (sig_kernel_coredump(signr))", so we don't need to check signr != SIGKILL.
We are only interested in the sig_kernel_coredump() signals anyway, and due to
the previous changes we almost never can see other fatal signals here except
SIGKILL.
