Sure, it's not always worth the trouble/pain to do so unless you've
actually got some reason to think it will be mis-used.
This is seeming more and more like such a case: it's a very special
purpose macro which is only used by two other small functions, both of
which are located immediately adjacent to the macro's definition.
If it _really_ makes you nervous, give it a big warning comment with
capital letters or something; that's almost certainly enough.

Quite grotesquely:
   int test3_0 (unsigned val)
   {
     return _calc_vm_trans_3 (val,0x20,0x80);
   }
   int test3_1 (unsigned val)
   {
     return _calc_vm_trans_3 (val,0x80,0x20);
   }
==>
   __calc_vm_trans_3:
           addi -20,sp,sp	#,,
           addi -1,r7,r5	#, bit1, tmp46
           addi -1,r8,r11	#, bit2, tmp51
           mov r6,r12	# x, tmp53

           and r7,r12	# bit1, tmp53

           addi 20,sp,sp	#,,
           jmp [r31]
If I only use one test function, gcc does a bit better, but still
generates various unnecessary function-call-related artifacts:
   int test3_0 (unsigned val)
   {
     return _calc_vm_trans_3 (val,0x20,0x80);
   }
==>
   _test3_0:
           add -16,sp	#,
           andi 32,r6,r10	#, val, tmp56
           shl 2,r10	#, <result>
           addi 16,sp,sp	#,,
           jmp [r31]
