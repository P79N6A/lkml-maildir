It is not that sudden at all. I experienced this problem many times so far
and working with a build system came to the idea of failing
builds when there are unresolved symbols.
I'm pretty sure that having this patch in mainstream
will make unresolved symbols a rare problem as many of them will be fixed soon.
So I'm pretty agree with Adrian that modules with unresolved symbols is a bug
and it MUST be fixed.
I would be very much interested to hear Andrew opinion on this as
he probably makes kernels even more often than any of us :)
Thanks,
Kirill
