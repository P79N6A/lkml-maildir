Subject: kernel.org downtime today

Precedence: bulk

zeus, a.k.a. ftp/www/rsync/finger/mirrors/filehub.kernel.org will be
down for a few hours later today, starting at 23:30 UTC/15:30 PST for
hardware maintenance and the installation of a gigabit connection.
The total extent of the downtime will depend on if we need to rebuild
the filesystem afterwards.  We hope not, but it's a definite
possibility, in which case the downtime may be as much as 24 hours.
