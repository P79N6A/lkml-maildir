If you allow more than one task to fault for example in the swapin path
you'll get in troubles as you can't solve this race cleanly with a
spinlock. That's why I added the semaphore to the shm segments in first
place.
Only replacing the down() with a read_down() in do_page_fault is _not_
enough. The semaphore is not there only to protect from mmap and vma
changes under us, right now it's there mainly to protect other threads to
fault under us.
IMHO the semaphore make a performance difference only with threads doing
paging of mmapped files while fooling readahead. The swapin case is not
intersting IMHO (and we do readahead also for the swapins). Maybe we can
find a way to drop the semaphore in the nopage path. The read semaphore in
do_page_fault make not too much sense to me as we should do really tricky
code to solve the races by hand without a performance advantage in RL.
