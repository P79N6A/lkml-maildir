Nope.  There's a table explaining how page flags and MTRRs interact in
the Intel x86 manual, volume 3 (it's in section 9.5.1 "Precedence of
Cache Controls" in the fairly recent edition I have here).
For example, with PCD set, PWT clear, and the MTRRs saying WC, the
effective memory type is WC.  In addition, there's a note saying this
may change in future models.  So you have to set PCD | PWT if you want
to get uncached in all cases.
