If you environment is sufficiently non-hostile that you don't worry about the
other users doing nasty things to you, then why don't you just give everybody
the root password?

That's a good enough solution for now.

I missed the start of this thread so I don't know what the original proposal
was. But if there was a mount option to disallow linking a file you can't
write, I'd use it. Sooner or later a "go through the system and link
everything" script will show up on a scriptkidddie site and then it will be a
real problem for people using quotas.
But the fact that we don't have a working revoke() is the more important
problem. Forget local attacks. What about telnet to port 80, type GET
/~user/bigassgif.gif, and hit ^]^Z so the transfer will never finish? rm
needs some teeth for such situations.
