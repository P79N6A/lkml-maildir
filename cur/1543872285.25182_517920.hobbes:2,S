This is not true. People care. Reasons:
  - resource planning
  - fairness
  - guarantees
  What you talk is about security only. Not the above issues.
  So good precision is required. If there is no precision at all,
  security sucks as well and can be exploited, e.g. for CPU
  schedulers doing an accounting based on 
  jiffies accounting in scheduler_tick() it is easy to build
  an application consuming 90% of CPU, but ~0% from scheduler POV.
