Hello,
today I've discovered a programming error in one of my programs (that's fixed 
already). When trying to replace the binary, I found out that the processes seem 
unaffected by a plain "kill": They just continue to consume CPU. However, a "kill 
-9" terminates them. ist that intended behavior? I guess not. Here are some facts:
top - 12:51:33 up 145 days, 22:20,  1 user,  load average: 8.06, 8.77, 9.51
Tasks:  85 total,   9 running,  76 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
Cpu(s):  57.4% user,   1.9% system,   0.0% nice,  40.6% idle
Mem:    191192k total,    90716k used,   100476k free,    19004k buffers
Swap:   132088k total,    29140k used,   102948k free,    37580k cached
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  Command
28042 daemon    25   0    92   32   28 R 13.2  0.0 163:59.44 extractMIME
29435 daemon    25   0    92   32   28 R 13.2  0.0 156:34.27 extractMIME

  156 daemon    25   0    92   32   16 R 13.2  0.0 135:24.49 extractMIME
 4079 daemon    25   0    92   32   16 R 13.2  0.0 109:48.36 extractMIME
This is about 3 minutes after executing this command:
kill 27176 27457 28042 29435  31211 156 4079
This happened for both SUSE kernels, old and new:
m1 2.4.20-4GB #1 Mon Mar 17 17:54:44 UTC 2003
m2 2.6.5-7.111-default #1 Wed Oct 13 15:45:13 UTC 2004
And no, the C program does not install any signal handler. If interested I can 
provide the binary together with sample parameters to execute the loop.
Regards,
Ulrich
