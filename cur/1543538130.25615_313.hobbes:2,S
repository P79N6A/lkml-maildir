Subject: missing autoconf.h in 2.4.0-test2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

My module includes module.h, which includes config.h, which consists only of:
#ifndef _LINUX_CONFIG_H
#define _LINUX_CONFIG_H
#include <linux/autoconf.h>
#endif
However, I don't have an autoconf.h.  It doesn't exist in the 2.4.0-test2
tarfile that I downloaded.  Can anyone explain this to me?  I know I'm doing
something wrong, but I don't know what.
