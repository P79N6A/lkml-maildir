In Sept of 2000, I did a survey of 30,000 websites and found that 8% of
them were unreachable from an ECN capable client.  Two major culprits were
identified, the Cisco PIX and Local Director.  To Cisco's credit, fixes
were released quickly.
Here is a message I sent with info about the Cisco updates:
