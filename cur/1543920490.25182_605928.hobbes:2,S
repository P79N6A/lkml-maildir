Subject: [PATCH] dcache: don't expose uninitialized memory in /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/16/305

From: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@citi.umich.edu>
Well, it's not especially important that target->d_iname get the
contents of dentry->d_iname, but it's important that it get initialized
with *something*, otherwise we're just exposing some random piece of
memory to anyone who reads the link at /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd> for the
deleted file, when it's still held open by someone.

(Am I missing something?  I've also run a test program that copies a
short (<36 character) name ontop of a long (>=36 character) name and see
that the first time I run it, without this patch, I get unpredicatable
results out of /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>.)
