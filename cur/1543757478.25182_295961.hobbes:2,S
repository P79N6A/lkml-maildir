You can walk the parentage chain up until you reach your login shell.
So you can look up info about the parent of every one of your processes
except for your login shell and any zombies.

Sure, that can't be bad.  I didn't really do anything so far that
warrants being called testing (compiles, runs, doesn't crash on boot --
send patch! ;).
But I also didn't invent this feature: it has been in OpenWall and
grsecurity for a long time now, so a form of restricted /proc has
received at least *some* testing.
