John, please stop insulting Andries, you would be _surprized_ to find out
how much he actually knows about a multitude of things.
As for Andries' point of loss of information, he has a point, _but_ James'
suggestion to put that extra info in the comment, imho, outweighs the
small disadvantages (code looks a bit uglier) which Andries pointed out to
counter it.
Regards,
Tigran.
