As said earlier, the additional cost is not really that much.  And if we
do get additional benefit of proper cache alignment for page struct
because of this additional pointer then it could be a almost zero cost.
And in mm kernel, I also see PAGE_OWNER defined which puts the whole
page struct out of sync with caches.
Christoph, Please let me know if there is still a placeholder for
container pointer ONLY for kernel pages.  I think it is easy to do away
with per page pointer for user land as it can be stored in anon_vma or
mappings.
