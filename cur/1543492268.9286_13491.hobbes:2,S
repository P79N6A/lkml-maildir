It just is. The ISDN code from the CVS tree contains support for more cards, 
support for compression, including LZS compression, and Telco approval for the 
HiSax driver on certain cards. And last time I compared them, the 2.2.x code 
would last about 30 seconds before crashing the machine, while the CVS code 
didn't crash.
Linus didn't want to accept the CVS code immediately before releasing 2.2.0,
and the only thing that went in to 2.2.x was a patch containing the most
important bug fixes. 
Even the ISDN code in 2.0.37 is newer than the code in 2.2.x, and contains
(IIRC) a some of the newer drivers, and the HiSax certification.
