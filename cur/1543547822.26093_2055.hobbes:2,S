Yep, thats' what I meant. Sorry that I was not clearer. But I think
that there are even with NetWare on IP not many new
installations. There is lots of migration of existing servers and
keeping existing systems alive but new rollouts?
But then again, maybe with MANOS and OpenNetWare, everything will be
different.
