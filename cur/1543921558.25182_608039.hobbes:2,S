It's hard to tell without LOCALE=C, but those are the sorts of results
I'd expect if you had run make {old,menu,x}config without specifying
ARCH=um, so you've configured for one architecture and are now trying
to build another.
Where is the include/asm symlink pointing to in your build tree?
(FWIW I get a coredump if I try to use the skas patch, but with noprocmm
UML in 2.6.23.1 builds and runs perfectly well on x86-32. I haven't
tried 2.6.23, but I see no reason why it should act any differently.)
