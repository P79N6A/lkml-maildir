To be able to test my modpost changes I am building arm for all configs.
I can see a number of legitime warnings for the ARM code.
Those I have investigated has all been of the case where functions
are used only during init but not marked init.
So no real bugs just potential savings and consistency.
Shall I try to fix them up and drop you a path?
Samples (with old warning format):
