Um... you can do that by shorting various pins on the PCBA if you have
access to an oscilloscope, or put it under heavy write workload and remove
power.
A modern drive has many thousands of reassign sectors available, so I don't
think either of these events will cause a permanent issue.
I'd also suggest reading older ATA specs, since some vendors still support
older commands that were capable of various wierdness that might be useful.
