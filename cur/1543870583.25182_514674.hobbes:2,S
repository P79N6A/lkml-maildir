Can we please stop this pointless episode of benchmarketing, where every 
mail of yours shows different results and you even deny having said 
something which you clearly said just a few days ago? At this point i 
simply cannot trust the numbers you are posting, nor is the discussion 
style you are following productive in any way in my opinion.
(you are never ever wrong, and if you are proven wrong on topic A you 
claim it is an irrelevant topic (without even admitting you were wrong 
about it) and you point to topic B claiming it's the /real/ topic you 
talked about all along. And along the way you are slandering other 
projects like epoll and threadlets, distorting the discussion. This kind 
of keep-the-ball-moving discussion style is effective in politics but 
IMO it's a waste of time when developing a kernel.)
