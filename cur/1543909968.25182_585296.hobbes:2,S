I'm sorry? The original kernel to exhibit the problem was 2.6.5 -- *that* was
a very old kernel and I insisted we upgrade before trying to report any
problems. However 2.6.21 is only one version out of date and it's about 3
months old. None of the changelog entries since then have mentioned any semop
or ipc related changes (aside from a hugetlb change but we're not using
hugetlb). It's more recent than most distributions have as their current
release.
I do share your feelings about vendor kernels. We've seen these problems with
SUSE 2.6.5 and 2.6.16 kernels though. This was the most recently released
kernel we've tried.

Still working on it.
