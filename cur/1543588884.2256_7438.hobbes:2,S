There is no guarantee that |= is implemented atomically - in fact its quite
likely to read
		get child->flags
		or PF_PTRACED
		write child->flags
and a PF_USEDFPU on another processor at the same instant -would- end up being
lost.
There are two fixes
1.	Make all the ops atomic (foo_bit())
2.	Split the flags
The preferable one for performance is certainly to backport the 2.4 changes
