I implemented it like it /proc/driver/{vendor}/{dev_pci}/ac-97-{num_ac97}
in the second revision of the patch.
I want to know if the second revision is acceptable.
I found a bug when using more than 1 board (duplicated entries in
/proc/driver) and fixed it so I'm creating a third revision. I also moved a
debug /proc entry created by es1371 module to the new directory because the
current behavior doesn't allow to debug more than one board. I tested it
using 2 boards (it was pointed out by William Robinson). I also moved an
entry created for ALi boards to the new directory (is cleaner and nobody
commented about it), also renamed it with a descriptive name. This entry is
used to enable the SPDIF part of the codec so now it is:
/proc/driver/ali5451/{dev_pci}/spdif
Also allowing for more than one ALiM5451 in the same board (really bizarre
since this is usually part of the chipset but .... how knows?)
SET
P.S. I didn't get any reply from the es1371 maintainer, is he actively
maintaining the module? The status indicates he is active so I think I must
be patient:
PCI SOUND DRIVERS (ES1370, ES1371 and SONICVIBES)
