Len and Zwane, I sure agree with you. I will take the config option out.
Would the APIC version be a good criteria to make a run-time decision
with Xeons? I know that everything Intel that can run EM64T has front
side bus (APIC version >= 20?). And I guess the boot parameter can still
be useful?
Thanks,
