Then fix madwifi so it builds modules as documented in
Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt
See: --- 5.3 External modules using several directories
As with many other external modules madwifi contains a lot of ugly
makefile hackery - and if done as documentated it gets so much simpler.
I'm aware that 2-4 support complicates things a little but if people
made it be slimm and nice for 2.6 and _then_ added 2.4 supporrrrrrrrrrit
woulllllld be much simpler.
It seems that people keep all the hackery for 2.4 and does a bad job
adapting to 2.6.
All the bad FAQ's out there does a good job confusing people.
Almost no-one mention SUBDIRS= as is preferred with 2.4 but seldom used
:-(
