Sorry, this was a long minute, however after applying your patch to
vanilla 2.4.19 (tg3 v0.99) by hand (the TG3_FLAG_WOL_SPEED_100MB already
is 0x800 there, and no adjacent bits are free), the kernel simply freezes
when I do "/etc/init.d/network start". The insmod is okay, the messages
look like always, but I could not get any more info on the freeze because
nothing gets written to disk, no output on the screen, no sysrq, ...
If I can do more to help sort this out, please tell me. With my fix to 
prefix every write with a dummy read, the system is rock solid, not a 
single glitch on 12 machines in the last 14 hours.
I'm very curious on how this all works, so would somebody please give me a 
pointer where to start reading concerning linux and PCI 
reordering/pci_write_config_dword?
Ciao,
					Roland
