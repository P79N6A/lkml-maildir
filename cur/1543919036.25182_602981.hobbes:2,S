I would tend to agree.  Right now I think the problem is that we are
getting too little reviews, not enough.  And someone who reviews
patches, even if unknown, could be building up expertise that
eventually would make them a valued developer, even while they are
doing us a service.   
The concern that I suspect some people have is what if this gets
abused by people who don't really bother to do a full review of a
patch before they ack it.  We could ask reviewers to include a URL to
an LKML archive of their review, to make it easier to find a review of
a patch so later on people can judge how effective they their review
was.  Unfortunately, this would be an added burden for the regular
reviewers, so I doubt this would be well accepted as a practice.  My
suggestion is to not worry about this for now, and see how well it
works out in practice.  If we start getting half a dozen or more
Reviewed-by: where the patch is pretty clearly not getting adequately
reviewed, or where someone is obviously abusing the system, and social
pressures aren't working, we can try to figure out then how we want to
address that problem then.  Let's not make the process too complicated
unless we know it's necessary.  Premature complexity is almost as bad
as premature optimization....
