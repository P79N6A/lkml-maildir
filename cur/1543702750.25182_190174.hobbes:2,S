The situation in vanilla 2.4 and 2.6 kernels is as follows: xxx_cs
drivers only drive PCMCIA cards.  They do not drive Cardbus cards -
Cardbus cards look exactly like normal PCI cards, and are therefore
the drivers are handled by the PCI subsystem.  PCMCIA helps out only
to detect the card insertion/removal events.
Hope this helps to make things a little clearer.

Indeed.

... which seems to be exactly the same as my 3ccfe575bt card I have here.
I note though that the product description seems to be wrong (the PCI IDs
are identical.)  The card is most definitely "3CCFE575BT" and not "3c575".
