  Could someone compile the attached program, and

  The attached program creates a small shm segment,
  a lock file & uses flock() to synchronize the access to
  the memory segment.
  The probem is that the synchronization fails:
  on UP: "./a.out 1000 10" fails after 5-10 second
  on SMP (2*PII): "./a.out 1000 2" fails nearly immediately.
hi manfred,
it fails here aswell, within 3-5 seconds or less depending on the
args.

gcc version pgcc-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release)
