Besides, we've had this interface for about 15 years, and it's called
"select()".  It scales fine to thousands of descriptors, and we're talking
about something that is a hell of a lot less timing-critical than select
ever was.
"Earth to Rusty, come in Rusty.."
How do we handle the bitmaps in select()? Right. We assume some size that
is plenty good enough. Come back to me when something simple like
	#define MAX_CPUNR 1024
	unsigned long cpumask[MAX_CPUNR / BITS_PER_LONG];
doesn't work.
The existing interface is _fine_, and when somebody actually has a machine
with more than 1024 CPU's (yeah, right, I'm really worried), the existing
interface will cause graceful errors instead of doing something
unexpected.
And if you're telling me that people who care about CPU affinity cannot
fathom a simple bitmap of longs, you're just out to lunch.
