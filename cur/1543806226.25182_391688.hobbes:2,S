Hi.
The patch in mm-tree
"powernow-k7-work-when-kernel-is-compiled-for-smp.patch" doesn't work
with current linus git-tree. The real problem is the function
"recalibrate_cpu_khz" which is parted of timers/timer_tsc.c (an
impilicit dependency! is this timer always available?).
for an smp kernel this function always returns -ENODEV.
The other changes in the patch are not needed, as fas as i understand.
Without the recalibrate_cpu_khz call the driver works on an up-machine
with an smp-kernel.
Why is the powernow-k7 driver the only driver which does this call to
recalibrate_cpu_khz, which corrects the jiffies for the new cpu
frequency)?
with kind regards
Thomas
