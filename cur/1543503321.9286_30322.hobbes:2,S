Hmm, I raytraced an image running three kernels differing only
in HZ value (+the HZ masquerading stuff). This is what i got:
[on a celeron@450MHz]
 HZ=100
8.63user 0.01system 0:08.64elapsed 100%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
 HZ=800
8.64user 0.01system 0:08.70elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
 HZ=1024
