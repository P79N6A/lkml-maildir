Some PIO transfers are regulated by the drive and the drive can lock the
bus forever. Newer chipsets like the SI680/3112 support watchdog
deadlock breakers for this but we don't really support them right now.
Getting different data off a failing drive is unusual because the blocks
are ECC'd extensively (well more than ECC'd) and have checks, could be
the RAM/CPU going I guess.
