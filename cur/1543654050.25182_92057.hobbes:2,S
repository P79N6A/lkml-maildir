Actually, as following proves, I wanted to be *300%* sure ;-).
        cli
        cld
# We are now probably running at something like 0x0000 : 0x1000
        call here
here:
        pop      %bx
        subw    $(here-wakeup_start), %bx
        shrw    $4, %bx
        # setup data segment
        movw    %cs, %ax
        addw    %bx, %ax
        movw    %ax, %ds                                        # Make
ds:0 point to wakeup_start
        movw    %ax, %ss
        mov     $(wakeup_stack-wakeup_code), %sp                #
Private stack is needed for ASUS board
        movw    $0x0e00 + 'S', %fs:(0x12)
        pushl   $0                                              # Kill
any dangerous flags
        popfl
        cli
        cld
Fixed now. [Not that it matters.]
