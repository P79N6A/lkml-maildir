Here is a patch that removes the xchg instructions.  As an interesting
note, I tested the difference in cycles between one xchgl and two movl
instructions on 3 different processors (a Celeron, a K6-2, and an
Athlon, all UP).  The celeron and K6-2 showed noticable improvements. 
The real surprise was the the Athlon, where the times were identical. 
This means that either the Athlon has a really fast lock cycle or it is
ignoring it.
