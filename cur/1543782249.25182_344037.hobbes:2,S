I'm not saying its lost, but that it is accumulated differently then how
it would be used in gettimeofday().
So a somewhat lengthy and exaggerated example with a clock that has 2
cycles per milisecond, HZ=1000 and a 0ppm adjustment to begin with.
I'm assuming gettimeofday()/clock_gettime() looks something like:
   xtime + (get_cycles()-last_update)*(mult+ntp_adj)>>shift
Using (1,000,000, 1) for the (mult,shift) pair.
So first, the easy case:
time(0): gettimeofday: 0 + (0 - 0)*(1M+0)>>1 = 0 ns
time(1): gettimeofday: 0 + (1 - 0)*(1M+0)>>1 = 0.5M ns
time(2): gettimeofday: 0 + (2 - 0)*(1M+0)>>1 = 1M ns
time(2): interrupt
time(2): gettimeofday: 1M + (2 - 2)*(1M+0)>>1 = 1M ns
time(3): gettimeofday: 1M + (3 - 2)*(1M+0)>>1 = 1.5M ns
Now, lets look at how we deal with ticks that arrive late:
time(6): gettimeofday: 2M + (6 - 4)*(1M+0)>>1 = 3M ns
time(7): gettimeofday: 2M + (7 - 4)*(1M+0)>>1 = 3.5M ns
time(7): interrupt
time(7): gettimeofday: 3M + (7 - 6)*(1M+0)>>1 = 3.5M ns
time(8): gettimeofday: 3M + (8 - 6)*(1M+0)>>1 = 4M ns
So everything looks ducky. Now on to when we make NTP adjustments.
time(11): gettimeofday: 5M + (11 - 10)*(1M+0)>>1 = 5.5M ns
time(12): gettimeofday: 5M + (12 - 10)*(1M+0)>>1 = 6M ns
time(12): interrupt (set ntp_adj = 1000 ~= 500ppm)
time(12): gettimeofday: 6M + (12 - 12)*(1M+ 1000)>>1 = 6M ns
time(13): gettimeofday: 6M + (13 - 12)*(1M+ 1000)>>1 = 6,500,500 ns
time(14): gettimeofday: 6M + (14 - 12)*(1M+ 1000)>>1 = 7,001,000 ns
Still doing fine. Now lets look at doing NTP adjustments while ticks
arrive late:
time(15): gettimeofday: 7,001k + (15 - 14)*(1M+ 1000)>>1 = 7,501,500 ns
time(16): gettimeofday: 7,001k + (16 - 14)*(1M+ 1000)>>1 = 8,002,000 ns
time(17): gettimeofday: 7,001k + (17 - 14)*(1M+ 1000)>>1 = 8,502,500 ns
time(17): interrupt, (set ntp_adj = 0ppm)
time(17): gettimeofday: 8,002k + (17 - 16)*(1M+ 0)>>1 = 8,502,000 ns
And bang, we have a 500 ns time inconsistency!
And that was only with a tick arriving 1/2 a tick late. I've dealt with
systems that on occasion miss 30ms worth of ticks due to SMI crazyness.
This is why I accumulate the entire interval with NTP adjustments
consistently between the timer tick and gettimeofday. 
Right now I'm not sure how to work around this issue with your proposal,
but let me know if you have an idea or I'm missing some other subtlety.
thanks
