These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness. It is 
configurable to any workload but the default ck1 patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck1-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.

+cfq-ts-050104.patch *
The latest version of the timeslice cfq I/O scheduler with i/o priority 
support
+isobatch_ionice.diff
Add discrete support for i/o priorities being linked with SCHED_BATCH 
and SCHED_ISO classes in the staircase cpu scheduler
+s9.2_s9.3.diff
A small change to the staircase scheduler. This backs out special quirk 
treatment of interactive tasks (so every task is now treated the same) 
and is a fix for some fluctuating interactivity issues people would have 
seen. It is a win in most settings but some people will notice bad 
behaviour with wine based games and audio while others will notice 
better behaviour with these games (go figure). A workaround is to run 
your games nice +19.
