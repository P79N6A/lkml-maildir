Hmmm, I was wondering if could come up with a pretty way to do this on
32 bit boxes that wants to enable highmem DMA. Right now
pci_set_dma_mask() wants a dma_addr_t which means you have to do
#ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM <blah> #else <bleh> #endif.
Introducing a new function that takes bit flags as arguments might be
better?
