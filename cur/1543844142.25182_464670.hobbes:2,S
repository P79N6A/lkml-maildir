Please CC me on the replies -I'm not on the list.
I can't figure out how to know if another module is loaded.  I know
/proc/modules has the list.  Do I open that with sys_open or is there a
better way?
I have written a software watchdog for the amd au1200 cpu that will
gracefully shut the unit off if nobody kicks me.
I've read the kernel resources, and searched the mailing list but I
don't see an answer.
Thanks for any pointers to more info or how to do it.
