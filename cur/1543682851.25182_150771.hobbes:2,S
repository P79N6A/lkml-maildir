Oooh Oooh!!!!
I have an onboard Promise SATA chip - the 30276 (its on an MSI KT4A Ultra 
board), which gives me two SATA and one PATA ports (only use 2 at a time)...
If you want someone to test...  I can slap a PATA drive onto the PATA port, 
but I've been holding off getting any SATA drives until I can use them under 
linux, although I'm running out of drive space so this is quite timely... :)
Cheers,
Mark
