Looking at the code again, I now think that vmalloc is wrong. I have made
some changes to lift the restrictions on interrupts being masked, but I still
need to hold a spinlock. So I think, I need to replace vmalloc with kmalloc
and SLAB_ATOMIC. Furthermore, I think I need to surround this with a pair
of preempt_disable/preempt_enable (given the interrupts are unmasked).
Thanks.
