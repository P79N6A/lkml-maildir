No. Look at the x86-64 code. The generic timeofday core calls
arch_update_vsyscall_gtod() (sorry for the function name confusion
above) any time the timekeeping variables change. 
All you need is to do is define  implement an ia64 version of
arch_update_vsyscall_gtod() which can then export the values passed to
it in whatever form you desire so it can be used by the fastcall.

Just per-cpu cycle counters like the TSC and ITC to my knowledge. The
PPC timebase increments off of a global bus-signal, so it is not
affected. I'd be interested in other examples, though.

I think you'll find otherwise. The arch_update_vsyscall_gtod() interface
gives each arch quite a bit of flexibility in how to implement their own
accelerated timeofday. 
In pseudo code, all you would need to do is something like:
arch_update_vsyscall_gtod(wall_time, offset_base, timesource, ntp_adj):
	fastcall_data.wall = wall_time
	fastcall_data.base = offset_base
	fastcall_data.ts = timesource
	fastcall_data.ntpadj = ntp_adj
fastcall_gtod(): [I understand this would be done in asm]
	switch(fastcall_data.ts.type):
	case TIMESOURCE_MMIO:
		now = <mmio read code>
	case TIMESOURCE_CYCLE:	
		bow = <cycle read code>
	case TIMESOURCE_FUNCTION:
		# special case for itc
		if (fastcall_data.ts.name == "itc")
			now = <cycle jitter read>
		else
			return gettimeofday()
	offset = (now - fastcall_data.base)
	offset *= fastcall_data.ts.mult 
	offset += fastcall_data.ntpadj
	offset >>= fastcall_data.ts.shift 
	return fastcall_data.wall + offset

Forgive me as I'm just not aware of these, and am thus hesitant to
change the core code for two known cases that can be cleanly dealt with
in the timesource driver code.
thanks
