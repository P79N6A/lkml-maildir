Pardon me for butting in...
It seems to me that returning an error on unrecoverable failure is 
ALWAYS the right thing to do.
We're not doing that right now, and that's okay.  We can simply admit 
that we're not quite doing the right thing and get around to fixing it 
later.
But once the fix has been made, why would anyone want it to be optional? 
  Is it so rare an event that the performance hit isn't worth the 
catastrophe which might occur if we don't properly return an error?
