I think this was just terminology confusion here again. Isn't "any code
that it cannot currently see" the same as "another compilation unit",
and wouldn't the "compilation unit" itself expand if we ask gcc to
compile more than one unit at once? Or is there some more specific
"definition" for "compilation unit" (in gcc lingo, possibly?)
