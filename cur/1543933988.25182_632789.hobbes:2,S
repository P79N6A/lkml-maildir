Greetings!
Some of the keys on my USB-HID keyboard generate scancodes which are
bound to big keycodes in `drivers/hid/hid-input.c` and
`include/linux/input.h`, like 418, 419 or 432. Is there any possibility
to change it (in runtime, without editing `input.h` and recompiling the
kernel)? Should `setkeycodes(1)` work today? I'm using 2.6.24-rc6-git4
kernel snapshot.
I've found several postings on lkml considering KDSETKEYCODE ioctl
functioning in kernel, but I'm not sure about how it is in recent
versions.
(Sorry if this is an offtopic here, point me to an appropriate
newsgroup/ml in that case.)
