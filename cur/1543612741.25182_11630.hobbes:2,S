    Really someone needs slapping across. What kind of code is that
    (in 2.5.1-pre6):
    drivers/scsi/sd.c:sd_init()
...
    The code is buggy. Scenario:
Yes, you are right, the code is buggy.
It looks like part of something I did a few months ago
for 2.4.6 or so. I tend to give the guarantee "correctness
preserved". So, the conclusion must be that before this
change was applied the code had precisely the same bug.
