Sort of yes and yes. The idea that the sibling gets put to sleep if a real 
time task is running is a workaround for the fact that you do share cpu power 
(as you've correctly understood) and a real time task will slow down if a 
SCHED_NORMAL task is running on its sibling which it should not.  The 
limitation is that, yes, for all intents you only have N hyperthreaded cpus 
for spinning N rt tasks before nothing else runs, but you can actually run 
N*2 rt tasks in this setting which you would not be able to if hyperthreading 
was disabled.
For some time I've been thinking about changing the balance between the 
siblings slightly to allow SCHED_NORMAL tasks to run a small proportion of 
time when rt tasks are running on the sibling. The tricky part is that 
SCHED_FIFO tasks have no timeslice so we can't proportion cpu out according 
to the difference in size of the timeslices, which is currently how we 
proportion out cpu across siblings with SCHED_NORMAL, and this maintains cpu 
distribution very similarly to how 'nice' does on the same cpu.
