It wont help, if you keep it in the development line. If you move it out
of the development line into the "other tree" then it is likely to be
accepted as _real_ release candidates which get a proper testing
coverage before declaring it stable release nr. XYZ.
Users _are_ scared off by the current release quality. Your model is
ignoring this part of the problem and just provides a pacifier gimmick.

After the _stable_ release, of course no schedule and release numbers
are necessary. The proposed scheme will work nicely.

People are clever enough to debunk sneaky gimmicks.
