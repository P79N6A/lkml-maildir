Heinrich,
Your analysis shows you know well what we're talking about and i think 
finally
you gave the optimal explanation...
I know very well the problems of the IBM DTLA series (i have a dozen of 
zombies here...)
and was mainly concerned about Maxtor disks.
Finally i agree it must be something that has to do with the use of 
hardware and/or firmware...
I will of course substitute my backup drive immediately !
Regards and thanks,
Gianluca
