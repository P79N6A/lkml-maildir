Subject: [HELP]: Where is current_set array in kernel 2.2.3 in i386  implementation?

I am updating a kernel module from 2.0.36 to 2.2.x (in fact, 2.2.3). In
the module source, there is
a context switch between the current process (A )and another one (B)when
a message arrive
from the network, but forcing B process to executed next instruction in
message handler by
using a long call which appropiate values. After doing that, it assigns
current_set[0] to B,
although I not sure why.  Now, this array does not exist any more.  Why
is this setting necessary?.
How does it change in 2.2x versions?.
Thanks
