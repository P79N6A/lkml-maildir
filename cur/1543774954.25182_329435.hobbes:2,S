Confirmed this behaviour. The problem appears in rc1 (where the TPM is
added). Unloading the module doesn't help, once it has been present the
system needs a reboot for the network card to function properly.
I don't really see how the TPM can screw things up for the network card
but I'm guessing it breaks something in the chipset (the TPM module gets
loaded for the LPC bridge).
