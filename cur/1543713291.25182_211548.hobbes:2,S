  Indeed.  The logs do show the type and brand of both the hard disk
drive and the CD-ROM drive.  It's just that, uh, well, the kernel
doesn't want to do anything with them afterwards...

  Thanks already :-)

  Hm.  There's only one PCI card (Radeon 7000), and I'm not sure I can
boot without it, as there's no on-board VGA controller.  I'll try the
BIOS hack though.
  More relevant info (maybe): I got an old version of the Debian
installer, which uses an older kernel, and the process goes on
normally (well, it halts later because the built-in NIC has a stupid
MAC address, but that's another problem).
  Thanks for the tips, I'll see how it goes.
Roland.
