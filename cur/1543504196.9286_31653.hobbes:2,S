I experienced the same thing under Linux 2.0.29 which was the first and last
time I had a machine with this ethernet card in it.  It also corrupts data
in a way which silently evades all potential checksums at the same time.
For example, I ftp'd a linux tarball and it had an error in it for each
time this message occurred.
Do yourself a favour; throw this pile of crap in the bin and buy an NE2k
clone at a trade fair for $2.  You will get better performance.
