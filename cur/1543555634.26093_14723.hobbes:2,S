This looks like a job for a script.  I.e. no kernel change necessary.
The script could go something like this:
1. User invokes with "hypermount sdb" in case of the sdb device
2. The script creates a /mnt/sdb directory
3. The script creates a /mnt/sdb/sdb<n> directory for
   each sdb1, sdb2,... found in /dev
4. /dev/sdb1 is then mounted on /mnt/sdb/sdb1 and so on.
You may also want some checks that the device isn't mounted already,
remove subdirectories that didn't mount (error return from the "mount"
command)
A "hyper-umount sdb" would simply umount every directory under /mnt/sdb/
This isn't really a kernel issue, you may want to discuss this with
distribution
maintainers instead.
