First and foremost it conveys the intent clearly - you are copying a
chunk of memory (namely a keymap) from one place to another - thus
memcpy. Plus it may produce smaller/faster code (but since it is not a
hot path this does not matter much).

Here I want to set up sysfs relation for the newly created struct
input_dev which is a child of struct maple_dev. The central bus
(maple) code has no idea of input device existence, hasn't it? IOW we
need:
     input_dev->dev.parent = &maple_dev->dev;
