The issues are:
1. ALSA wants to mmap the buffer used to transfer data to/from the
   card into user space.  This buffer may be direct-mapped RAM,
   memory allocated via dma_alloc_coherent(), an on-device buffer,
   or anything else.
   The user space mapping must likewise be DMA-coherent.
   Currently, ALSA just does virt_to_page() on whatever address it
   feels like in its nopage() function, which is obviously not
   acceptable for two out of the three specific cases above.
2. ALSA wants to _coherently_ share data between the kernel-side
   drivers, and user space ALSA library, mainly the DMA buffer
   head/tail pointers so both kernel space and user space knows
   when the buffer is full/empty.
