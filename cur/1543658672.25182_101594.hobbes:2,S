Exactly, that's not a characteristic of the CPU, it's a system board thing
and support is really a low level kernel option.

No, you missed what I was talking about... reread the above, I said SMP
was an os feature *unlike* mtrr, etc.

In general by architecture dependent I meant "specific to one
architecture" or even one processor. HT is only on one type of CPU, mtrr
is on one family of CPUs, etc. As opposed to SMP, which is possible on any
of the supported CPUs, even if there isn't a Linux supported example of
it. There was even a board mounting two AMD Socket7 CPUs with a bunch of
glue which ran some BSD variant (no VM, I assume).
I don't mind you disagreeing with me, I'd appreciate it if you would stop
misreading what I said and then claiming I don't know I'm talking about.
