Hello,
I'm not sure if this has been discussed yet, I'm not completely caught up with the current kernel list. However with the pending release of Linux 2.4, it may be time to bring this up again.
I've created a rough draft (intended for discussion only!) of a press release for Linux 2.4, if we decide to go with one. Greg Smart and Albert Cahalan attempted this for Linux 2.2 but I don't think anything came of that work -- now I've decided to step up and make a fool of myself for Linux 2.4. :)  
Please take a look at this and let me know what you think. There's probably someone on this list who actually knows what to do with a press release, it's quite a bit beyond my experience. Feel free to edit this as appropiate.
Oh, and I stuck a small plug for my "Wonderful World" document at the end. For a final version, we would want to point that at a good resource for more information about the release-- I'm a bit biased in this respect.
Thanks,
Joe Pranevich

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
LINUX KERNEL 2.4 (DRAFT!)
The Internet, August XX, 2000
Linus Torvalds and the kernel development team would like to announce the immediate availability of Linux 2.4, the latest revision of the popular open source operating system kernel. This update brings increased scalability and performance to all Linux users, in addition to new hardware support. 
Notewothy Features:
-> Enterprise Ready! Linux 2.4 includes changes that make it even more ready for Enterprise environments. This new revision supports up to 64 gigabytes of RAM, allows files to be larger than 2 gigabytes, supports many more simultaneous processes, and has been largely rewritten to take better advantage of systems with multiple processors.
-> Cutting-edge hardware support. Linux now supports Itanium, the 64-bit Intel hardware soon to be released as well as the S/390, an IBM mainframe, and SuperH, often used in WindowsCE handhelds. Linux 2.4 improves support for Intel and Apple desktop and server hardware, in addition to Compaq servers based on the Alpha processor, Sun Sparc systems, MIPs systems, and other platforms.
-> Linux is now even better suited for desktop environments with a  new resource manager and support for USB and Firewire hardware. Additionally, Linux 2.4 also improves support for PC Cards (PCMCIA) and legacy "Plug-and-Play" cards.
-> Rewritten network layer to be faster than ever before, especially on multiprocessor hardware. This new layer brings to Linux the flexibility and power formerly available only with expensive routing hardware.
-> Support for version 3 of the popular NFS filesystem for sharing files in UNIX-like environments.
-> Linux 2.4 includes special enhancments for webservers including a kernel-level web server and "wake one" support for speedier page serving with all popular web servers, including Apache.
-> Logical Volume Manager for easy administration of disk space, including adding, deleting, and resizing disk slices on the fly.
This update is already available to advanced users through multiple kernel mirrors (ftp.kernel.org) Although no timeframes have been announced at this time, all current Linux distributors will be updating to this version of the kernel within the next several months. 
Linux is developed by a online team of programmers headed by Linus Torvalds, a resident of Santa Clara, CA. Linux has been developed using the open source methodology which provides for source code and peer review at all stages of development. It is because of this system of openness that Linux has grown to be the most successful non-corporate operating system to date.
For more informatoon, please consult www.linux.org for a list of other Linux-related websites. More information on the new features in Linux 2.4 can be found in the "Wonderful World of Linux 2.4" document, available ...
