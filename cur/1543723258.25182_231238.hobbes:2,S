There are two different types of privileged accesses on ARM.  One is the
standard load/store instruction, which checks the permissions for the
current processor mode.  The other is one which simulates a user mode
access to the address.
We use the latter for get_user/put_user/copy_to_user/copy_from_user.

No, because the uaccess.h function will fault, and we'll end up returning
-EFAULT.
