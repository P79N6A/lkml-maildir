Hi Bernd,

You may want to try to cut back on io ports probed by cardmgr.
Almost the same happens on my box, when I don't cull some of the io ports
in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts. You can try commenting out some of the ports 
there (I believe 0x800 was the culprit on my laptop, ymmv).
Hope this helps,
Bas Vermeulen
