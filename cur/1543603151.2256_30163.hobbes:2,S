How far is it to go from a mitigated IRQ (because of too high an interrupt
rate) to a polled interface (e.g. for network cards)?  This was discussed
a number of times to improve overall performance on bust network systems.
Concievably, a network card could tune max_rate to a value where it is
more efficient (CPU wise) to poll the interface instead of using IRQs.
However, waiting for the next regular timer interrupt may be too long
(resulting in lost packets) as buffers overflowed.  Would it also be
possible for a driver to register a "maximum delay" between servicing
interrupts (within reason, on a non-RT system) so that it can say "I
have X kB of buffers, and the maximum line rate is Y kB/s, so I need
to be serviced within X/Y s when polling without losing data".
Cheers, Andreas
