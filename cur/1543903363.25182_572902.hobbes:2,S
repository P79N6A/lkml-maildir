No, that doesn't fly in this case. The loop driver actually has a
compat_ioctl method, but the problem is that some tools try to
call this ioctl on devices other than loop.
We could of course add a fallback handler to compat_blkdev_ioctl(),
but I'm not convinced that this is better than the IGNORE_IOCTL
helper, unless we eventually move all of fs/compat_ioctl.c into
drivers.
