Right, sorry, I was imprecise in my wording.  What MVFS wants is per-task
private state and state inheritance on task forks.

I'm curious to see Peter's prototype code (mentioned in his reply).  I
worry that to get safe access to the parent task's private state during
fork, we'll need something like a private hash table for our private
per-task state.  Ideally we'd like to just be able to find stuff hanging
off the task structure directly.
