Why move it?
Having it in the tree makes it nice and easy to use it, 
and easy keeping it in sync.
BTW: I have an improvement wish for cramfs: 
Add the date of filesystemgeneration to the image header somewhere 
and use that to update the time info in the inode, that way you could
get a cheap way of having some valid time stamp for the files without
it taking a lot of space (helps if you have a webserver and the browser 
caches stuff)
