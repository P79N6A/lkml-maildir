I have Toshiba Portege 4000, which apparently needs smsc_ircc2 driver. Driver 
seems to load OK:
Detected unconfigured Toshiba laptop with ALi ISA bridge SMSC IrDA chip, 
pre-configuring device.
Activated ALi 1533 ISA bridge port 0x02e8.
Activated ALi 1533 ISA bridge port 0x02f8.
found SMC SuperIO Chip (devid=0x5a rev=00 base=0x002e): LPC47N227
smsc_superio_flat(): IrDA not enabled
smsc_superio_flat(): fir: 0x2f8, sir: 0x2e8, dma: 03, irq: 7, mode: 0x02
SMsC IrDA Controller found
 IrCC version 2.0, firport 0x2f8, sirport 0x2e8 dma=3, irq=7
No transceiver found. Defaulting to Fast pin select
and it registers irda0 interface but no /dev/ircomm* ever appears. I need them 
(or at least I /think/ I need them) for SynCE (for installing programs in my 
Pocket LOOX).
What is missing? Do I need additional driver? How can I access ircomm on this 
HW?
TIA
