Actually it is a compiler optimizer barrier, not a no-op.

Because x86 is architecturally defined as having ordered writes (unless you use 
write combining or non temporal stores which normal kernel code doesn't). So it's 
not needed.

Hmm, I suppose one could add a wc_wmb() or somesuch, but WC 
is currently deeply architecture specific so I'm not sure
how you can even use it portably.
Why do you need the barrier?
