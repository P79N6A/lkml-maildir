It really exists in the wild on both large memory and storage machines. I hope
we don't have to patch Samba on every release to add POSIX fadvise calls in
order to have a more polite VM. A 'cfq' for write generators from vm to devices
would be nice if it can auto probe the device write speed so we don't have to
use knobs. Just let the kernel figure out what are the best values to the
algorithms would be the ideal world.
