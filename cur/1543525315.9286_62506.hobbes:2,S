I'm getting very reproducible memory corruption in 2.3.41, 2.3.42, and
2.3.43, luckally it seems that 2.3.40 is stable..
The quickest way I have to reproduce this is to try and untar a tar.bz2
of the kernel source, it almost never manages to complete the task
before segfaulting, a quick gpg check of the tarball shows that its
corrupt..
After rebooting the system the tarball checks out fine, leading me to
the conclusion that I'm seeing memory corruption..
Attached is my .config, and my system specs are as follows..
A Intel P200MMX (not overclocked).
A PC100 128M DIMM.
The MB uses the PIIX4 chipset, I don't have the model of the MB at the
moment, but its a Abit..
My network card is a intel eepro, the 10mb version.
The sound card is a Jaton 4DWave DX, using ALSA to drive it.
I also have a Voodoo Graphics card in the system..
And a AHA1540 SCSI card, which is not currently in use..
Here is the kernel output from boot on the drives..
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL SE2.1A, ATA DISK drive
hdb: QUANTUM LPS540A, ATA DISK drive
hdc: FX810T4, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL SE2.1A, 2014MB w/80kB Cache, CHS=1023/64/63, UDMA(33)
hdb: QUANTUM LPS540A, 516MB w/96kB Cache, CHS=1120/16/59, DMA
If there is anything else I can provide to help track this down please
let me know..
