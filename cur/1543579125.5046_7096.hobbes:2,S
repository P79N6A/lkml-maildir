On Solaris and Irix, there is an auxillary file in /etc that maps
the hardware path to a controller to a controller instance number.
This lets you name a device based on the controller instance number,
and to possibly move to a different physical slot it if needed.
Some examples:
Irix /etc/ioconfig.conf:
2 /hw/module/1/slot/io9/fibre_channel/pci/0/scsi_ctlr/0
This says that SCSI controller 2 is really a Fibre Channel controller in
slot 9 (on an Origin 2000).
Solaris /etc/path_to_inst:
"/pci@4,4000/scsi@3" 0 "qla2200"
This says that the QLA2200 Fibre Channel controller in slot 3 of PCI bus
4,4000 is controller 0 (zero) for the qla2200 driver.
"/pci@4,4000/scsi@3/sd@0,3" 737 "sd"
This says that SCSI target 0 will be unit 737 for the sd driver.
