Um, we have that already; the sync_inode() followed by
blkdev_issue_flush() is the path taken by fdatasync(), I do believe.

Ah, yes, that's what you're getting at.  True, but for better or for
worse, we have no other interface other than blkdev_issue_flush().
This will guarantee that the data has made it to the disk controller,
but it won't necessarily guarantee that it will have made it onto the
disk platter, as I understand things; but I don't think we have any
other interfaces available to us at this point.
