If you'd like to live without all /proc-using tools, much of /sbin,
the X server, inetd, anything that uses sendfile(), and anything
that uses RT-signals for IO events... go right ahead. You can give
up on VFS enhancements too, since anything using them wouldn't be
portable to AIX, Ultrix, or OpenServer.
Partial list of non-portable system calls for you to abstain from:
mkdir           have fun, because this isn't portable
sigaction       you know what to do...
setreuid
symlink         you can use the v7 filesystem too
iopl            obvious
clone
setfsuid        didn't Ted come up with this one?
poll            can't use select either
prctl           comes from IRIX, not v7
pread           SysV, isn't it? Must be bad!
sendfile        just some benchmark hack
SCO has some UNIX source that might be more to your
liking than Linux is.
