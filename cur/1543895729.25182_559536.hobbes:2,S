No, I've seen it somewhere and it well confirms with my own observations.

Yes, sure, de-duplication on files level brings its benefits, but on FS 
blocks level it would bring ever more benefits, because there are many 
more or less big files, which are different as a whole, but with a lot 
of the same blocks. Simple example of such files is UNIX-style mail 
boxes on a mail server.

Sure, file level deduplication is simpler to implement, but it is 
generally less powerful, than FS block level one. And seems it should 
not be hard to add the above (1)-(3) features in the existing Btrfs 
structure, especially on this stage, when the disk format isn't 
stabilized yet.
