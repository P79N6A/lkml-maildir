It isn't a module anymore. CONFIG_IP_ALIAS controls only a few bytes of 
additional 2.0.0 compatibility code now (actually with a soon to be released
new nettools it will be 100% obsolete). A kernel module takes at least one
page to load (4KB), so it would be a serious waste of memory to dynamically 
load that code as a module. Just compile always in.
