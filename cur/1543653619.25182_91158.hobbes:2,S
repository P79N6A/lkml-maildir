Andy,
In the four fs/cifs/smbdes.c (which is based on a similar password hash in
Samba) hits from your tool the code is a little strange looking but does
not have a buffer overrun.  Apparently the tool is not checking the maximum
size of the index since although the s_box array is only 256 bytes in size,
the array index is an unsigned char and can not go beyond 255 and overrun
the array.  As long as unsigned char can never go above 255 the code should
work.   It might have be more readable if it were defined as a  __u8
instead of an unsigned char.
Thanks.
