Ok, thanks for testing.
In that case, I think the best fix is to let NPCS0 stay selected
permanently in MR and overwrite CSR0 with to the new slave's settings
before asserting CS. But that's a more complicated change, and I don't
know how it will affect the AT91RM9200 special cases.
So I suggest we merge your patch for 2.6.25, and try to optimize it
for 2.6.26.
David, do you want me to pass on the patch with my signoff or just ask
Andrew to add my Acked-by to the patch already in mm?
