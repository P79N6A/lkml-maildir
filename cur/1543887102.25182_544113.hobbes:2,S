Hi Ingo,
  Please apply.
  This series of patches fixes a build breakage and some minor issues
including oonverting spinlocks to raw ones, adding a need_resched_delayed 
check, etc. for powerpc64.
  This applies on top of linux-2.6.21 and patch-2.6.21-rt1.
  Compile and boot tested for both PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_RT on Celleb.
  Compile tested for PREEMPT_DESKTOP.
  Thanks in advance.
