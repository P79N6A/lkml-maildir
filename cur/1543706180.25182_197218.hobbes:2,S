 - Go to the directory you compiled the kernel in
 - do: gdb vmlinux
 - you're in gdb, now do: 'x/i ide_pci_register_host_proc' This will
   disassemble starting at ide_pci_register_host_proc, and needs (I
   believe) debugging symbols present ... well, try it, and if gdb
   complains that it can't, that's that
 - Keep entering "x/i"; this will make gdb keep disassembling the next
   instruction. Keep doing this until you're past
   <ide_pci_register_host_proc+0x27>, I assume.
 - to get out of gdb, hit ^D or type "quit"
