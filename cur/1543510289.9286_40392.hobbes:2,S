     Well, what processor gives that ?
   At Alpha ...  Depending on GCC optimization level the calculation result
   of block hash is from 23 instructions (gcc optimized, 4 memory loads)
   via 30 instructions (Compaq C Compiler optimized or not, along with 13
   memory loads) to 42 instructions (gcc -O0, 12 memory loads)
I'm talking about the hash function value computation alone.
Once the device/ino pair and bh_hash_shift are in a register,
it is 10 instructions later that the hash value is computed.
Later,
