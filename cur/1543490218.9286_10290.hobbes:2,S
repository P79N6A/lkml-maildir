What I want to be able to do is be able to limit the traffic
for multiple connections through the one interface. For example,
traffic from subnet.x can only use 10% of the bandwidth and subnet.y
can use 20%, etc.
The traffic shaper seems to do what I want but it seems to need
one interface for each stream you want to shape.
Since firewall rules can tag packets, would/is it be possible
to set rate limits based on packet tags? Or is this already done
under a different name/too tricky/bad/not useful?
This way you could limit traffic between many subnets and
interfaces simply.
