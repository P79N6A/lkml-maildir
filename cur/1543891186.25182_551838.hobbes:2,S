In the situation being discussed, "ATA/IDE Mode" was set to "Native" in the
BIOS (the other option for this item was "Legacy").  The BIOS had a separate
"Configure SATA as" item with the options RAID, IDE and AHCI and it is this
one which, when set to IDE, prevented Linux from finding the Marvell PATA
chip - even though "ATA/IDE Mode" was set to "native".
The legacy/native issue Jeff discusses sounds like it relates to the
"ATA/IDE Mode" BIOS setting.  Since this was always "Native" during the
tests and given what Jeff wrote, I would have thought the BIOS would not be
using the legacy ISA-era settings and therefore they were not the reason for
Linux not finding the Marvell PATA controller.
