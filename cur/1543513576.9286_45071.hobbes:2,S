I'm sorry if this question has been raised and subsequently answered, but
here goes anyway.
I have a machine with a Crystal audio controller using the cs4232 and
ad1848 modules to drive it. The version of the linux sound system is 3.8o
(kernel 2.2.13).
Whenever a sound file is played directly to /dev/dsp (with xmms or mpg123)
a loud pop comes out of the speakers. I'm not sure if it's caused by the
device being opened or by the first data that is written to the device.
Also, the guts of ad_mute() and ad_unmute() have been removed from
ad1848.c since 3.5.4-beta8 of the sound system, but I don't know if that
would make any difference.
Thanks for any help.
Ben.
