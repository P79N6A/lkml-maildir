Right, so it's incoherent with pagecache and userspace can no longer
usefully read this file.

OK.

It would be nicer of course to actually use the mm/page_io.c code.  That
would involve implementing swap_bmap() and reimplementing the
get_swap_bio() stuff in terms of a_ops->bmap().
But the swap code can afford to skip blockruns which aren't page-sized and
it uses that capability nicely.  You cannot do that.

yup.

submit_bh() can and will allocate memory, although most decent device
drivers should be OK.
There are tricks we can do with writepage.  If the backing filesystem uses
buffer_heads and if you hold a ref on the page then we know that there
won't be any buffer_head allocations nor any disk reads in the writepage
path.  It'll go direct into bio_alloc+submit_bio, just as you're doing now.
IOW: no gain.

It's publicer than bmap+submit_bh!

Was kinda hoping that would be the outcome.  It's rather gruesome, using
set_fs()+vfs_read() on one side and submit_bh() on the other.
Are you sure the handling at EOF for a non-multiple-of-PAGE_SIZE file
is OK?
The loss of pagecache coherency seems sad.  I assume there's never a
requirement for userspace to read this file.
invalidate_inode_pages() is best-effort.  If someone else has the page
locked or if the page is mmapped then the attempt to take down the
pagecache will fail.  That's relatively-OK, because it'll just lead to
userspace seeing wrong stuff, and we've already conceded that.
But if the pagecache is dirty then invalidate_inode_pages() will leave it
dirty and the VM will later write it back, corrupting your bitmap file. 
You should get i_writecount, fsync the file and then run
invalidate_inode_pages().
Or not run invalidate_inode_pages() - it doesn't gain anything and will
just reduce the observeability of bugs.  Better off leaving the pagecache
there all the time so that any rarely-occurring bugs become all-the-time
bugs.
You might as well use kernel_read() too, if you insist on begin oddball ;)
