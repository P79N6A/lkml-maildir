I failed to find any source for Montavista XIP implementation, which
they claim they have put on their "Consumer Electronics" release.
Mind  you, I do  know that Montavista has no  obbligation of giving me
that piece of  source, as I  haven't  bought any of  their products (I
would if I could gather some technical  papers on their implementation
of XIP)  but  it would be  nice  if anyone knew  something about  this
issue.
Best regards,
andrea
