Hmm, looks good, the current version has the advantage, that one sees
the available input range, but that's probably only important for
debugging.
So far I want to keep it simple, it should be just enough for people to
play with and for me to experiment with some ideas. Anything more fancy
has to wait.

It's not the first time I hear this, I'd really like to know where this
is coming from. I don't mind if someone implements the ui with another
toolkit, I'd actually be happy about this, as the ui part is more of a
burden for me, but until then I keep things simple for myself.
bye, Roman
