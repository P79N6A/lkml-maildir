I couldn't find any processes that looked to use a lot of address space, so
I switched to single user mode (kills most everything...) and ran pstree and
/proc/memstat:
init-+-bdflush
     |-init---bash---pstree
     |-keventd
     |-kjournald
     |-ksoftirqd_CPU0
     |-kswapd
     |-kupdated
     |-lockd
     |-mdrecoveryd
     `-rpciod

I'll test without preempt and see if it shows up again.  It took a day
before though, so...
