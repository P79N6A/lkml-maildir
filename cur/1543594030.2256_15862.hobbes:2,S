What is are the guarantees about the order of calls to
pci_driver::suspend and pci_driver::resume?
Will a driver get calls like
	suspend(D3)
	suspend(D2)
	suspend(D1)
or just one suspend call?
What effect does the return value have on the rest of the system?  On
the order of succeeding calls to pci_driver::suspend functions?
And where is that patch to Documentation/pci.txt young man?  :)
