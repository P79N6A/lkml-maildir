I saw your suggestions related to this about a year ago.  I like the
idea of doing statistics per-controller and getting rid of disk_index().
But by moving statistics into the request queue, under the current
implementation, we have to allocate statistics memory for every major,
since for every major there is a request_queue asscoiated with
it(blk_dev[MAX_BLKDEV]).  Do you care about this?
