I believe it would largely stay up to date yes. The tag wouldn't be 
mandatory and adding oneself as a MODULE_MAINTAINER would specifically 
be saying "yes, I want to look after this thing". If someone then no 
longer wants to, getting rid of the tag is a matter of deleting one 
line. I wouldn't be worse than MAINTAINERS, and being inline, I expect 
it to be better...
