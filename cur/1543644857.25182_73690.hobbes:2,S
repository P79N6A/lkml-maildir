   I'd like to gain a solid understanding of what these three knobs do.
   Could you explain that a little more?
My basic understanding of fifo_batch is:
1) fifo_batch is how many contiguous requests can be in
   a "set"
2) we send out one write "set" for every two read "sets"
3) a seek works out to "seek_cost" contiguous requests,
   cost wise, this gets subtracted from how many requests
   the current "set" has left that are allowed to be used
