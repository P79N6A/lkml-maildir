No special kernel is needed. You have a proper crossover cable
connecting your ethernet cards?
You simply have to assign ip addresses to each card properly. It might
be easiest to assign different subnets to each.
192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0 to the first and 192.168.2.1/255.255.255.0 to
the second. That should get you started.
