	I would like to thank Artur Skawina for pointing out that
this can be done with dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "symbol") and even include
a sample program, and also Ulrich Drepper for saying that there
was a way to do it with dlsym.
	Based on Artur's example, I have made a new release of logwrites
in 
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/pub/dist/pkg/logwrites-1.21.tar.gz
 and I
am examining zlibc (the transparent compression intercept library) to
see about making the same stackability changes there.  Thanks for the 
helpful information.
