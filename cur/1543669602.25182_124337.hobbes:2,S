That's certainly possible. I was rebuilding 2.4.21-pre7 with both
compilers, and suddenly the gcc-2.95.4-built vmlinux.coff succeeded
to boot. I didn't expect that, since I've been fighting these boot
problems for weeks now.
I managed to reproduce the problem with 2.4.20 vanilla + only the
one patch to ld.script to fix the CLAIM error on "loading .data":
the kernel compiled with gcc-3.2.2 boots, the one compiled with
gcc-2.95.4 fails at the "clearing .bss" step. The images, vmlinux
and vmlinux.coff for both compiler versions, and .config are in

 in case anyone wants
to check what's wrong with the 2.95.4 build.
