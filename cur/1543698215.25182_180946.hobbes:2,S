Well you don't provide enough code to actually compile NotGood(tm).
I would guess that you failed to do:
        init_waitqueue_head(&timer_queue);
... in your initialization code, so wake_up_interruptible() is
waiting forever...... Look at the drivers provided in the
kernel source. All the initialization stuff is mandatory.
