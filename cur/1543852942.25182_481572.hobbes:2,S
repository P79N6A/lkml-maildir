Hi Alan,
yes, the same happens with ide-scsi:
mount dvdrw/
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0,
       missing codepage or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so
syslog:
Nov 12 17:41:59 section_eight attempt to access beyond end of device
Nov 12 17:41:59 section_eight sr0: rw=0, want=68, limit=4
Nov 12 17:41:59 section_eight isofs_fill_super: bread failed, dev=sr0,
iso_blknum=16, block=16
Regards
Sebastian
