It turns out the problem here is that some .o files wind up with their own
.note.gnu.build-id sections.  I got the makefile magic wrong, thinking that
LDFLAGS_MODULE was a variable specifically for .ko links.  It's also used
in cmd_link_multi-m.  So the problem David and Adrian saw is not actually
machine-dependent at all, nor is it an ld bug as I had guessed, but depends
on the configuration details that determine when cmd_link_multi-m gets used.
I'll post a makefile fix shortly.
Thanks,
Roland
