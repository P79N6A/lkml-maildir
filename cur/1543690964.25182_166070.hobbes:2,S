If you want lean code you should look everywhere. I agree that init code
is free, and that there are worse offenders. But adding additional bloat
that the people who actually builds a kernel properly to fit their
hardware can't eliminate without patching, then perhaps that shouldn't
happen.
I'm not at all against having an option in the menu to "eliminate code
to support non-targeted processors." That could remove the code you so
want to have in so you don't have to build a properly configured kernel
for each machine.
How does "#if !defined(NO_BLOAT) || WANT_ARCH_IN_QUESTION feel for a
good thing to surround many parts of the kernel.

The term "grandfathered" comes to mind, you are proposing to add new
bloat, and you justify that so you don't have to build a properly
configures kernel for each hardware configuration. I don't think anyone
will argue that all such code should be found and treated in the near
future, but if we did have a flag to prevent eggregious support for
non-selected hardware, I bet the embedded guys would contribute patches
over time to clean things up. And shouldn't 2.6 better than 2.4, instead
of "not much worse?"

As long as you don't have to add new code to support the functionality
in another way. The advantage is that if you can remove it you can
probably also make it modular, and that might be a nice thing during
development of embedded systems. Somewhat smaller but available?
