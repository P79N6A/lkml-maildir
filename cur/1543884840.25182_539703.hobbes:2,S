Subject: ExpressCard hotswap support?

I've got a Thinkpad Z60m with an ExpressCard slot, and I got a Belkin
F5U250 GigE ExpressCard (Marvell 88E8053 chip using sky2 driver).  It
appears that Linux only recognizes it if I insert the card with the
system powered off.  If I hot-insert the card, nothing happens (no
messages logged, no PCI device shows up, nothing).
Does Linux support hotswapping ExpressCards?
This is with Fedora Core 6 with all updates, kernel 2.6.20-1.2948.fc6.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
