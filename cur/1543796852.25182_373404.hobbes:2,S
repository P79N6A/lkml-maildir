If a new udev config is needed with every new kernel, why isn't it in
the kernel tarball? Is that what you mean by "broken distro
configuration?" The info should be in /proc or /sys and not in an
external config file, particularly if a different versions per-kernel is
needed and people are trying new kernels and perhaps falling back to the
old.
Have "make install" drop the udev config in /boot like the initrd file.
The the boot could create an slink to "/boot/$(uname -r)-udev" or some such.
