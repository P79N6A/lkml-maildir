2.4.20pre8, up for about a day, stopped responding.
This box is our staff NAT box, and has been stable running 2.4.19-pre4
for 183 days.  On Saturday morning, I put 2.4.20-pre8 on, and did not
notice until now that it was spitting these messages everywhere:
ip_tables: (C) 2000-2002 Netfilter core team
ip_conntrack version 2.1 (1014 buckets, 8112 max) - 292 bytes per conntrack
ASSERT ip_conntrack_core.c:624 &ip_conntrack_lock not readlocked
ASSERT ip_conntrack_core.c:94 &ip_conntrack_lock readlocked
ASSERT: ip_nat_core.c:841 &ip_conntrack_lock not readlocked
ASSERT ip_conntrack_core.c:94 &ip_conntrack_lock readlocked
ASSERT ip_conntrack_core.c:1063 &ip_conntrack_lock not readlocked
ASSERT ip_conntrack_core.c:1074 &ip_conntrack_lock not readlocked
ASSERT: ip_nat_core.c:841 &ip_conntrack_lock not readlocked
ASSERT ip_conntrack_core.c:94 &ip_conntrack_lock readlocked
(Taken from after a reboot, but the kern.log is full of these messages
from last time.)
Just now, the box died with the console full of this message:
ASSERT: ip_nat_core.c:841 &ip_conntrack_lock not readlocked
No Oops or backtrace occurred.  Sysrq apparently didn't work.
