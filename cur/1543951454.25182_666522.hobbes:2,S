Subject: [PATCH] [4/7] Don't use large pages to map the first 2/4MB of memory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/11/470

Intel recommends to not use large pages for the first 1MB 
of the physical memory because there are fixed size MTRRs there
which cause splitups in the TLBs.
On AMD doing so is also a good idea.
The implementation is a little different between 32bit and 64bit.
On 32bit I just taught the initial page table set up about this
because it was very simple to do. This also has the advantage
that the risk of a prefetch ever seeing the page even
if it only exists for a short time is minimized.
On 64bit that is not quite possible, so use set_memory_4k() a little
later (in check_bugs) instead.
