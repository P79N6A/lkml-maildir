i'd exclude this option based on the second latency trace: that too 
shows a delay in ata_bmdma_status().
so my guess would be that this device doesnt do MMIO, and the PIO inb() 
causes some bad BIOS-based SMM handler/emulator to trigger, which takes 
16.6 msecs. If indeed the device is not in MMIO mode, is there a way to 
force it into MMIO mode, to test this theory?
