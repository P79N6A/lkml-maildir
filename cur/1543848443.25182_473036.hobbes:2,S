Where is the connection between the card driver and the frontend(s)?
Is it in card driver source files or frontend source files
or in Kconfig files?  I looked but didn't see it (in Kconfig).

There seems to be a good bit on dependence between the Multimedia devices
menu and DVB/frontends menus.. without having much Kconfig language
dependence info there.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I hope so.
