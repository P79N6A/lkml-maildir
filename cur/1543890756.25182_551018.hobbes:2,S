[ BTW gcc does not generate code for such cases already; either for the
condition whose truth value is already known, or for the codepath that
will never be executed as a result. ]

A common scenario I could imagine for the above would be where a typo
makes someone declare a var as size_t when it should've been ssize_t.
This is clearly a real bug that would get caught with this gcc warning
(but not with -Wall).

Erm, to qualify my rather strong opinion above: there could perhaps be
exceptions where the condition being removed could be truly redundant,
of course :-)
