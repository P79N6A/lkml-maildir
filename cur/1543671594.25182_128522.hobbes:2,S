Hello Roman,
I have difficulties with configuring the kernel with "make xconfig":
  g++ -Wp,-MD,scripts/kconfig/.qconf.o.d -O2  -I/usr/lib/qt3/include  -c -o 
scripts/kconfig/qconf.o scripts/kconfig/qconf.cc
scripts/kconfig/qconf.cc: In destructor `virtual ConfigItem::~ConfigItem()':
scripts/kconfig/qconf.cc:291: error: non-lvalue in unary `&'
make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/qconf.o] Fehler 1
make: *** [scripts/kconfig/qconf] Fehler 2
After changing the offending line, it did compile and I was able to configure 
the kernel. However, I am not really sure, whether this change is correct:
