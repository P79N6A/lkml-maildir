No argument from me, but I have seen systems driving up the system time
and beating the cache with scheduling logic and context switches. There's
a balance to be had there, and in timeslice size, and other places as
well, and real data are always useful.

It's always more effective if it's subtle and and people take an instant
to get it.

Great. I have no doubt that when you have convinced yourself one way or
the other you won't have any problem convincing me. When the io was slow,
the VM was primitive, and the scheduler was a doorknob, preempt made a big
improvement. Now that the rest of the kernel doesn't suck, it's a lot
hardware to make a big improvement.
