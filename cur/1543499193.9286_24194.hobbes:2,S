Hi Marius.

Neither of the above is a problem if the CD's were created with the
RockRidge extensions enabled, and that's the correct way to deal with
the above problems.

Note that Joliet and RockRidge are not incompatible - I regularly
create CD's with both enabled, and they all work fine under both Linux
and Windows.

Hopefully, the above comments help.
