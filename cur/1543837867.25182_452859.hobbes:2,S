A couple of patches were attempted for this but they didn't solve the
underlying races. The main reason was a lack of understanding of what
the existing backlight lock protects and trying to make it do two thinsg
at once.

If we can find a way to safely do the locking in the backlight core I
agree.

First, we need to define the potential problems. Dimitry mentioned: "For
example, it could possibly race with setting power through sysfs
attribute". This is not what the lock in the backlight core is for
though. To quote backlight.h:
/* This protects the 'props' field. If 'props' is NULL, the driver that
   registered this device has been unloaded, and if class_get_devdata()
   points to something in the body of that driver, it is also invalid.
*/
My previous patches have gone a long way to removing race issues. The
need for the existing lock comes from backlight_device_unregister()
which basically does:
class_device_remove_files()
bd->props->brightness = 0;
bd->props->power = 0;
bd->props->update_status(bd);
bd->props = NULL
fb_unregister_client()
class_device_unregister()
If we could guarantee that after class_device_unregister(), nothing was
still executing any of the show/store methods, we'd be fine (the
fb_notifier is safe). As I understand the class device and sysfs
attributes, we can't guarantee that though. I'd appreciate comments from
the device model people as I could be wrong about this. The owner field
also can't help us.
Dimitry's "Backlight: convert to use default class device attributes"
patch should really mean the class_device_unregister() call is moved to
earlier in the function to try and avoid races from the attributes but
it still doesn't guarantee anything.
If we could somehow sync class_device_unregister(), we could get rid of
that semaphore entirely. 
Regardless, if we want to add locking for synchronising the attributes
into the core, we need a different lock. I did think the drivers would
be able to handle this themselves with locking inside update_status if
needed but I can see why certain drivers might not like that.

Think about the case where you have 2 framebuffers. The notification
call was left to pass to the driver as only it can work out which
framebuffer a given backlight is attached to.
