I need to do some filtering of keyboard characters, before any other process
gets a chance to get at them.
On a  text based terminal,  I could write a line discipline, and pass on
what I dont want to handle to the default N_TTY line discipline. Is there
any other way?
Also how can I do the same when gnome or kde is up and running?
