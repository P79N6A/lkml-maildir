Subject: [patch 00/14] Syslets, generic asynchronous system call support, v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

this is the v2 release of the syslet subsystem. This is an interim 
release, not all known and pending items are fixed/changed yet - the 
tree is still work in progress:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/syslet-patches/
The biggest conceptual change in v2 is the ability of cachemiss threads 
to be turned into user threads. This fixes signal handling, makes them 
ptrace-eable, etc. (I've updated the sample userspace code at the URL 
above to also do user-space cachemiss processing - just Ctrl-Z the 
async-test.c run to trigger it action.)
Things not yet done in v2 and planned for v3:
 - multiple completion rings support
 - share the 'spare thread' between multiple rings, to further reduce 
   startup costs.
 - remove mlock() reliance
Changes since v1:
 - FPU support fixed: detach FPU state from kernel thread state 
   (implemented by Arjan van de Ven)
 - remove superfluous CLONE_VM from create_async_thread()
   (noticed by Jens Axboe)
 - sys_umem_add() does not ignore -EFAULT of __put_user()
   (noticed by Andrew Morton)
 - use VERIFY_READ instead of VERIFY_WRITE in copy_uatom()
   (noticed by Andrew Morton)
 - move schedule() to tail of loop in cachemiss_loop()
   (noticed by Andrew Morton)
 - added move_user_context() arch op
 - added async_syscall() and recursion protection against re-entry of 
   sys_async_exec(), sys_fork()/sys_clone(), etc.
 - added sys_async_thread() call - a user-space thread can thus call 
   back into the syslet subsystem and continue cachemiss work.
 - further cleanups in the include files
 - race fixes to sys_async_wait()
 - optimized out the kmalloc()/kfree() of the async_head
 - async_thread structure not on the kernel stack anymore, to allow 
   async contexts to run user-space.
 - added support for head_stack and head_eip to enable the initial 
   thread/task to run a cachemiss user context too, if it gets turned 
   into a cachemiss thread.
As always, comments, suggestions, reports are welcome.
