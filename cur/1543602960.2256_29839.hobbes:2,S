It uses an UDMA-100 certified cable, it is the regular flat type.
80pin, both ends connected, no defects or sharp bends detected.
I have tried 3 _NEW_ cables now, and none of them fixes the problem.
I have also tried 2 disks with the same results.
I have not overclocked, and I run the safest bios config I can think of..
It is also _VERY_ predictable..  It only occurs at that one point during
booting of Linux. (See the logfile attached with the last mail)
I surely don't understand what I have done wrong if anything..

PS: Thanx for any help!
