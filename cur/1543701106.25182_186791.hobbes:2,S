I did this with 2.4 a few months back.  Basically all I did was add the same
delay before mounting root as the kernel does with mounting a root floppy. 
Problem is the kernel is too fast for the usb code to find the disk.
I'v been wanting to ask this question.  How can I make the kernel "sleep"
for say 5 seconds (or pause or something, whatever is required to delay
execution) to wait for the device to become available.  I tried the same
thing doing nfsroot with a cardbus nic which fails because the kernel
doesn't see the card until after it attempted to mount /
