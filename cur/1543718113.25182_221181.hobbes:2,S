Shared libraries.  And no, those will never lead to any writes, no matter how
you modify them (MAP_PRIVATE).  Which is the point, since that's where we
are doing relocations and we definitely do not want that to hit the disk ;-)
IOW, we can remove writes of dirtied mmap'ed pages from consideration.
