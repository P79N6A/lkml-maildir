Sorry if I wasn't clear. This is basically what does the driver. At 
least, the led interface _do not_ control the WIFI state :-)
What I meant is that there are two kinds of laptops:
A - the one where wifi led _only_ is controlled by the wistron hardware. 
Wifi card is controlled completely independently (pcmcia).
B - the one where wifi card _and_ wifi led are controlled by the wistron 
hardware (they are completely bound).
So far, only B laptops were handled, à la RFkill: the button directly 
modifies the wifi state and wifi led with no userspace involvement. My 
patch adds wifi led interface only to A laptops, only the led is 
controlled. So wifi state is never modified by led interface.
I hope I cleared up what does this patch and that it's ok with you. If 
not, just let me know which behaviour you think would be more 
appropriate and I'll hack a new patch :-)
See you,
Eric
