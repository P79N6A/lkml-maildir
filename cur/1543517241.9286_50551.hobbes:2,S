If they are combined with IPv6, they just might.... (see below)

There is a known bug in the kernel-configure scripts with IPv6 and netlink. 
Usually, a "make oldconfig" after a normal config solves the problem. It
might be just the case that this bug affects your kernel (although usually
it does not build).
The question, therefore, is: Do you have IPv6 configured?
