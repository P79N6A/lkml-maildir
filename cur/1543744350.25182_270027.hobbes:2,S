Just that it takes an hour or so to rebuild the kernel plus the
disk storage to keep two kernels instead of one.
The wakeup latencies I am seeing are all quite small, but the overhead
I am seeing at the application level have been quite high. Only 40 wakeup
latencies > 50 usec in a half hour of testing. I guess I'll build a
.24 without wakeup timing to see what kind of problems I'm having.
I can send you the wakeup timing traces if you are interested but
they are all really short (< 100 usec) or appear to indicate a hardware
contention problem (one step at 100 usec or so).
