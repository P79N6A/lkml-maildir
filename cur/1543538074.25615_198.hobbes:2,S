It sounds like you really need a private macro or private debugging
code, not a modification to a function which nearly all kernel code
calls at one time or another.
I don't think too many people are going to favor changing printk to be
optimal for "quick debugging checks"... which involve userland
addresses and/or paging.  printk should be optimal, sure, but this is
NOT a case the core kernel needs to optimize for.

What exactly are those problems?
