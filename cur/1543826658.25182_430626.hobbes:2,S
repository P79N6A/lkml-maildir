That is close to the way it was working, but it
had build errors with synclink=y and hdlc=m which
is what started all of these patches.
I guess I could add an extra check for that broken config
case in all the individual source files using conditional compilation
and disable synclink HDLC support altogether if such
a broken selection of options occurs (through
a random config generation). Still messy, but
since there seems to be a consensus that using the 'select'
facility of kbuild is forbidden, that may be the more
politically palatable way to go.
