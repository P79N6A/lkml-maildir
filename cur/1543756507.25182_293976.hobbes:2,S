wrt darcs, you're mostly correct.  There is the possibility of a "partial"
repository, which doesn't have the full history, but that isn't the
default, and therefore tends to be less well-debugged.  On the other hand,
if you never try to *look* at the history, you're pretty much safe--the
bugs tend to show up when you try to browse that history which you *do*
have.
