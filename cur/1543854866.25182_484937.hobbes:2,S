That is a clever idea... Is that going to work in all architectures with all
compiler flags?

I agree with all API related comments. I will clean it up in the next refresh of
the patch. I wanted to get the comments on this mechanism in general and
wanted to be doubly sure that I am not breaking anything in cascading timer
by doing something like this. Looks like the mechanism is OK.
So, I will work on a cleaner patch and repost.
