Please don't do this. This way leads to madness when 96/128 bit or
whatever !64 bit comes. (And I can confirm it's cool.) Don't you say
"well" here, I remember being f*cked up when we doubled the bit rate once
on another system. (It was from 4 to 8 bits, actually. Nice time.)
Hardly ANYTHING will be !CONFIG_NO_64BIT.
