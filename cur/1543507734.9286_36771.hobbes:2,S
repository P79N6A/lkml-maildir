Hi,
I'm working on a program that uses IP aliases. This program works on older
version of the kernel but not the 2.2.5, which comes with RH6.0.
To make the story short, I set up an IP alias (192.168.100.160) on an
interface card eth0:1. However, when I execute the following command,
	shell> ifconfig eth0:1 down; ping 192.168.100.160
The ping actually receives couple replies after the "ifconfig down" command.
Executing the ping command from another machine yields the same result. Is
this the correct behaviour ?
When I try this test on RH5.2, no responses are received by the ping, which
is what I would expect ...
Any suggestions, help would be appreciated.
Mike
