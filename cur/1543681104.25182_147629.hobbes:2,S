Jamie, he is talking about select here.

That's true, it is the beauty of the poll hook ;) I said this a long time
ago. It is addressable by a wake_up_mask() and some code all around. I did
not see (as long as other didn't) any performance impact bacause of this,
with throughput that remained steady flat under any ratio of hot/cold fds.
Since it is easily addressable and will not require an API change, I'd
rather wait for someone to report a real (or even unreal) load that makes
epoll to not flat-scale.
