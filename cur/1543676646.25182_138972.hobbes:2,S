	What you are suggesting just can't work for an unconnected socket. The
kernel has no idea where the next packet you send is going to go. It could
be along an uncongested path, it could be along a congested path. If there
were a single buffer, then packets bound for congested paths would block
packets bound for uncongested paths. UDP streaming media programs would
effectively reduce their throughput to that of their slowest local path.

	Right, if some arbitrary write operation will not block. There's no
guarantee about a particular future write operation. Consider TCP and a
non-blocking 250Kb write.

	I think too much of the context has been lost for me to reply specifically.
I don't remember which specific case you were dealing with. But the
fundamental point I'm trying to make is this -- you cannot guarantee
non-blocking operation with blocking socket calls. You can't make bricks
without straw.
	If you don't ever want to block, you *MUST* communicate this to the kernel
by issuing non-blocking operations. You *CANNOT* rely on 'select' to provide
you accurate information about arbitrary future operations. The kernel
simply cannot, in principle, provide such guarantees.
	I'm providing examples of cases where the 'guarantee' doesn't hold not
because those specific examples are the cases you are hitting. I'm providing
them to show you that you don't have a guarantee.
