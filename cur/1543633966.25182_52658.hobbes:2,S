Linus applied them already, they will be in 2.5.22. They fix real bugs and
i've seen no problems on my testboxes. Those bits are a must for SMP x86
and Sparc64 as well, there is absolutely no reason to selectively delay
their backmerge. Besides the last task_rq_lock() optimization which got
undone in 2.5 already, all the recent scheduler bits i posted are needed.
