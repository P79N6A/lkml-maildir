That would make sense if more of this were done at a higher level.
As it is right now, the decision whether to use PPR, SDTR or WDTR is
entirely up to the driver.  I think there's a lot more consolidation
that could be done into the midlayer, but we should probably see what
other drivers requirements are before making it perfect for sym2.
