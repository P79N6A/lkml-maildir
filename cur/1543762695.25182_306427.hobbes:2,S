Because the people that contributed the code you want to use said so.

You're creating a derived work that could not exist without all the GPL
code that came before.

Likely this won't be enough to keep you or your company from being sued.

So what?   The people that created the kernel GPL code weren't necessarily
trying to topple microsoft.   In essense, all they said was they were
willing to share their code with people who were also willing to share.  
You're probably better off writing your proprietary driver on a
proprietary operating system.
