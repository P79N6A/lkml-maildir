Why do you need this ?
How about identifying the cards in user space :
#!/bin/sh
ETH_A=`find_eth_by_MAC 00:56:56:78:d3:32:23`
ETH_B=`find_eth_by_MAC 02:84:56:78:45:32:62`
ETH_C=`find_eth_by_MAC 67:56:5c:fd:d3:32:64`
configure_first_eth_card $ETH_A
configure_second_eth_card $ETH_B
# leave the third unconfigured
# configure_first_eth_card $ETH_A
-------------
find_eth_by_MAC is a ( hipothetical ) program that returns the
name of an interface ( like eth0, eth1 ... )  based on it's MAC
or maybe some other criterium , that identifies the card.
