From the web *browser*'s point of view, it is handled by the
"filesystem" (which is provided by the various servers).  The browser
doesn't care how or where the data is stored.  It just requests a file,
and gets some data back.  So the browser doesn't have to check for
http://www.example.com/,
 get a failure (trying to read a directory),
check for 
http://www.example.com/index.html,
 etc.  In this way, the web
server controls (which I think takes the place of the filesystem in this
case) what gets shown (index.html.sv, etc.), instead of the leaving it
up to the browser.
In the same way, you don't want every single user program to have to
guess whether it should look at .data, or .contents, or whatever.
