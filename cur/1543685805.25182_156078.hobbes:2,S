The CPU's aren't overclocked and have worked fine for
me under much heavier loads than booting a kernel for
at least a year. Using the 2.4 kernel that is. Once
I remove the exception code from the kernel it boots

Should say 1.2 GHz processor I imagine. AMD and their
wacky naming schemes. This is before they had they
wacky number scheme.
