On the Xeon, the cache can be 2 MB. You want to reload that?
Sure you can reload, but it hurts. You'd let NT have a
performance advantage over Linux.

OK, but that is still slower. When the byte swap instruction
was added, there was a measurable performance improvement.

I do mean SMP. Last I heard, the kernel could support either SMP
or an external 387 FPU. You make your choice at compile time.

No, for the invlpg instruction. Xchg is hopeless.

Note: from distributions, not from the kernel source.
The 386 is essentially extinct. Use the source if you have one.

Not all of them do. The 486SX-25 was very popular at one time.
Of course, this has little to do with an _external_ FPU using
IRQ 13 for exception handling.
