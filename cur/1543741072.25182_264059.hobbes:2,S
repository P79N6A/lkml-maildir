No, kmap-atomic() maps a single page into the CPU's address space by making
a pte point at the page.  To unmap that page we need to get at the pte, not
at the page.  If kmap_atomic() were to take a pageframe address we'd need
to search the whole fixmap space for the corresponding page - a reverse
lookup.
