Hi All,
These two patch sets implement a new page replacement algorithm based on
CLOCK-Pro.
The first patch set: page-replace-*, abstracts the current page replace code
and moves it to its own file: mm/page_replace.c.
The second patch set: clockpro-*, then implements a new replace algorithm by
reimplementing the hooks introduced in the previous set.
Andrew, Nick, the kswapd-incmin patch is there again ;-)
I know there is still some disagreement on this patch, however without
it reclaim truely sucks rock with this code.
What happens is that zone_dma is severly overscanned and the clockpro
implementation cannot handle this nicely.
