Yes, but you can get around it in userspace. See
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6060
(Short answer is this from include/linux/binfmts.h.:
/*
 * MAX_ARG_PAGES defines the number of pages allocated for arguments
 * and envelope for the new program. 32 should suffice, this gives
 * a maximum env+arg of 128kB w/4KB pages!
 */
#define MAX_ARG_PAGES 32
I'm assuming your arch has 4kb pages, so the 'problem' is that you're
passing more than 128kb of cmdline arguments.)

The article has a bunch of ways. You don't really need to change
the kernel though ... if you don't mind generating 39000 new processes
one after the other, I'd do something like 'for FILE in * ; do mv $FILE
/usr/local/www/images ; done'. Probably slower than calling mv once due
to process overhead done 39000 times, but it *works*, and it's simple.
(If you use a csh instead of something bash-like, change that to fit.)
