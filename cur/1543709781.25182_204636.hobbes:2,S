Grant,
Both ISA and PCI device drivers would call arch/ia64/kernel/irq.c:request_irq()-->arch/ia64/kernel/irq.c:setup_irq() -->arch/ia64/kernel/iosapic.c:iosapic_startup_level_irq() or  arch/ia64/kernel/iosapic.c:iosapic_startup_edge_irq() function to unmask the IRQ. I believe the ISA can be handled gracefully, if any.
ISA is legacy to IA64. The configuration script of 2.4.23 has CONFIG_ISA off explicitly for IA64, 2.6.2 doesn't have this option for IA64. I just wonder whether the legacy probing method still exists on IA64.
Thanks,
