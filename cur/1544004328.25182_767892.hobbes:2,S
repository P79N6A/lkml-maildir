The base cpu_alloc is indepedent. And your laziness on the zero based
stuff only hurts the x86_64 version. Frankly, I think we should stop
merging 4k patches until you have finished the work on zero based because
that is elementary for various other things and simplifies 4k work. And it
has been pending for more than 6 months now.
