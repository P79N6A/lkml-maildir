This is the link under the class directory to the renamed device.

Why does your code need to call device_rename() itself, I'd have

[Don't know if ip is sensitive to order, but shouldn't that be
ip link set dev dummy0 name foo0 ?]
You could try to switch on DEBUG_DRIVER and DEBUG_KOBJECT, this may
point to where the double name pops up.
