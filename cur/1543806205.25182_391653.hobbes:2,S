Six of one half dozen of the other.  It doesn't matter so I don't
care.

list_add_tail is duplicate code.  It is already present in the caller.
So it is noise and confusing to leave it here.
But you already noted that in the following email.

Actually 90% of the point was to remove the need for __detach_pid.
But you are right __detach_pid would be safe and we know that because
of the ordering.  At the same time because we are not the last reference
the code will never do that.
I need to relook at this.  To not conflict with your code some of
the detach_pids need to be removed so we don't unhash things twice.
