You're insane running a -mm kernel on a production machine, IMHO.
They're good for desktop use but in my experience anything that needs to
stay up for more than a few days should at LEAST use one of the
stability-oriented patches like -mjb or -osdl, if not the vanilla
kernel.
2.5-mm typically goes nuts with such errors as you described after a
few days of uptime, as far as I've seen and noticed. These bugs will
probably eventually be fixed, but at this time, it's still unstable.
I wouldn't run anything above 2.4.20 on a box that does what you
describe..

Josh
