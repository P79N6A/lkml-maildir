Comapq Evo800c here, boots somewhat fine. 2.5.58 hung at
"Uncompressing, booting...", 2.5.59 did almost the same, but then I
noticed the disk actually doing stuff, and by waiting, up popped the
"login:" promt after a while, but nothing was printed to the console
during boot.
I have module-init-tools 0.9.9_pre1 installed, and get about 2000
lines in my /var/log/messages with mostly soudn and alsa related
symbols that doesn't resolve.
