This represents the driver updates and other fairly stable changes that
have been floating around in the SCSI trees for a while.  The only
controversial element is updating the aic7xxx/79xx drivers.  I've been
receiving reports that the 1.3.9 version of the aic79xx was
non-functional in 2.6, so I updated it to 1.3.11 based on Justin's tree
(after confirming with the reporters that this fixed their problems).
The tree is at
bk://linux-scsi.bkbits.net/scsi-for-linus
and the short changelog is:
<rask:sygehus.dk>:
  o aha1740.c: Allow level triggered interrupts to be shared
Andi Kleen:
  o Mark Ninja SCSI driver as !64BIT
  o Mark aha152x as ISA and !64BIT driver II
  o Mark correct aha152x driver (PCMCIA) as !64BIT
  o Fix 64bit warnings in BusLogic driver
Christoph Hellwig:
  o aacraid updates for new probing APIs
  o convert inia100 to new probing API
Douglas Gilbert:
  o sg Bugfixes
  o scsi_debug lk 2.6.0t6
James Bottomley:

Kai Makisara:
  o Add char_devs to st This patch adds support for cdevs to the st
driver. The changes are based on Doug Gilbert's corresponding changes to
the sg driver. Using cdevs brings the following advantanges:
Mike Christie:
  o [RFC]  fix compile erros in ini9100 driver
