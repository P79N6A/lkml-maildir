Hi Kevin,
there have been similar reports previously, all with recent Logitech 
dongles. See for example [1].
The bug is triggered by hid2hci when it tries to switch the Bluetooth 
dongle from HID to HCI mode. Most probably Logitech has changed the 
sequence that is needed to switch the dongle.
hid2hci has hardcoded reports that it uses to switch the dongle between 
HID and HCI modes. These reports are vendor-specific and are not described 
in report descriptor, therefore it's non-trivial to know what new pieces 
of hardware are expecting.
Marcel, did you by any chance have time to look at the dump that Amedee 
catched using usbsnoop some time ago? [2]
Thanks.
