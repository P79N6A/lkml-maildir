It should be a couple of UHCI controllers.
The UHCI driver in the beginning didn't support multiple UHCI
controllers, but it has for the last couple of months.
I don't have the Apollo Pro 133A, but I do have an Athlon with a VIA
chipset, which should use the same southbridge and both UHCI drivers
work fine with the builtin USB.
