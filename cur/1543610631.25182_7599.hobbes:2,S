Looks like it was a local problem. Some strange behaviour of a symlink 
/usr/src/linux pointing at /usr/src/linux-2.4.16-pre1. But when I entered 
/usr/src/linux and did a make menuconfig, make dep etc. it started building 
in the linux-2.4.15 directory. Don't know if that's a local fs corruption, 
but after entering the /usr/src/linux-2.4.16-pre1 directory it builds correct.
