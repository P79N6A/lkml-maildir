Well maybe.  But it's awfully presumptuous for us to say that no platform
will be capable of telling us what its maximum number of CPUs is, or even
whether certain CPUs within that range aren't possible.

Yup, on my 2-way x86 test box, with NR_CPUS=16 we have
cpu_possible_map=0xffff.
That's just insane - the default setting for a distro kernel should be (or
will become) NR_CPUS=lots, HOTPLUG_CPU=y.  All those for_each_cpu() loops
are iterating across 16 CPUs.
aargh.

That would make sense.
