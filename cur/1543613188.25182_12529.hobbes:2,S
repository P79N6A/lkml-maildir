	Heyla, Folks.  I just noticed that 2.4.17-pre7 seems to have
broken joystick input.  Under 2.4.16, I load the gameport module,
input, joydev, the emu10k1-gp module and finally the protocol module
for the joystick, and am able to calibrate and use the joystick
normally.
	Under 2.4.17-pre7, I go through the same process and get a
/dev/js0: device not found error when I attempt to calibrate.
/dev/js0 is symlinked to /dev/input/js0 which is node 13-0
	Could this be a symlink problem (Which would be foreboding) or
could it be as I hope, and something that just cropped up in the input
core code?
	Please CC me any replies, as I'm not subscribed to the list.
