Sure, but it restrains our options for later.  We have ACLs and posix
capabilities on the list for now, but NT attributes (for Samba) and
DMAPI attributes for HSM data migration are also on the wish-list.
Doing a proper attributes implementation now will avoid a whole lot of
pain later on, and 32-bit capabilities just seems a bit short-sighted
for now.
