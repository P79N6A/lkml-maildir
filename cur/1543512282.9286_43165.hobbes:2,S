	Welp folks, there you have it.  Okay, so what work needs to be done
to change over to 32bits for major/minor?  Is that going to be enough?  Is
there a way to get information from a driver via it's major/minor?  Perhaps
a user-space proggie that could scan through the major/minor's for the scsi
devices and get information about each device and use that information to
either create links to the broken /dev/sd*, or to just out-right create the
devices to begin with?
	What about hot-swap w/ scsi devices?  If you add in a disk between
two other disks, what's going to happen?  Can we have a list of major/minor's
currently in the system and a way to get information about them, and perhaps
a way to be notified (in userspace) when a new device is added or removed?
