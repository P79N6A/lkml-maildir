Sure but I think we're getting pedantic here. The problem is really simple - a 
uniprocessor HT desktop booted in SMP mode feels half the speed while running 
setiathome (or video encoding or whatever cpu bound task) compared to booting 
it in UP mode. So, ironically, enabling the HT makes the machine feel slower 
when running multiple tasks. And there will be a heck of a lot of these in 
the future.
