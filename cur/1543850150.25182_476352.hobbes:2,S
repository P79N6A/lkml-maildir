With the code I have in Suspend2 (which is what I'm working towards),
the value includes the swap_type, so there's no overlap. Assuming the
swap allocator does it's normal thing and swap allocated is contiguous,
you'll probably end up with two extents: one containing the swap
allocated on the first device, and the other containing the swap
allocated on the second device. So (with the current version), striping
would use 6 * sizeof(unsigned long) instead of 3 * sizeof(unsigned
long).
