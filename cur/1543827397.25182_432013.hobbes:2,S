Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI fixes for 2.6.17-rc6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here are some small PCI fixes against your latest git tree.  They have
all been in the -mm tree for a while with no problems and do the following:
	- restore the pci config space in reverse order, fixing a number
	  of different systems on resume.
	- properly pass up errors on pci resume to the driver core so it
	  knows about it.
	- fix building the pci express hotplug driver on non-acpi
	  systems (like PPC64).
Please pull from:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
