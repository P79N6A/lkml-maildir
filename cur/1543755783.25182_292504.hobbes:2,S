OK. Function dbg_dyn_timer_tick only printks if the sleep was less
than expected and the system woke to a non-timer interrupt. But when
idling, it should still printk something occasionally.

Yeah, and if the first patch was working better, that means the PIT
interrupts work. I'll do another version of the patch where PIT
interrupts work again without local APIC needed, let's see what
happens with that.
