    Hello Brother!  I am in Los Angeles, an alum from Cal Theta, ' 78.  I am 
trying to trace a possible ancestor, G. B. Null, Penn. Gamma, ' 62.  That's 
1862 !  I picked your name because you are among the earliest brothers listed 
on your chapter's website.  If you or any of your chapter brothers know where 
I might be able to access some of the 1862 eleven-member class roster and 
personal data, it would help my search tremendously.  G. B. Null is recorded 
in the Grand Catalogue, but only in my 1977 issue. There is nothing 
indicating home town or county.                 Thank you for any help you 
can provide.                                            Bill Null...
