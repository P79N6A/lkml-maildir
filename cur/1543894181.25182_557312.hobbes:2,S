Well much as I don't like what Tivo did with only allowing signed
kernels to run, I don't see anything in the above that says they can't
do that.  They let you have the code and make changes to it, they just
don't let you put that changed stuff on the device they build.  The
software is free, even though the hardware is locked down.  The GPL v3
really seems to change the spirit to try and cover usage and hardware
behaviour, while the spirit of the GPL v2 seemed to me at least to
simply be to allow people to copy and change and use the code, and pass
that on to people.  It didn't have anything to do with what they did
with it on hardware.  Nothing prevents you from taking tivos kernel
changes and building your own hardware to run that code on, and as such
the spirit of the GPL v2 seems fulfilled.  It covers freedom of the
source code and resulting binaries, not of the platform you run it on.
The GPL v3 has a much broader coverage of what it wants to control,
which to me means the spirit is different.
I don't have a tivo, I use mythtv on my own PC.  Tivo doesn't force you
to buy their hardware after all.
