   I've started looking through the network devices for bloat caused
   by the change in size of this type and I haven't found it anywhere.
Consider network drivers (most PCI ones) that keep track of:
	struct sk_buff *skb;
	dma_addr_t mapping;
pairs for each transmit packet.  With your suggested change,
their structures will increase 32-bits in size for each entry
when CONFIG_HIGHMEM on x86 or on a 64-bit platform.
I mean, just grep for dma_addr_t in structures of these networking
drivers to see where the wasted space would be.
