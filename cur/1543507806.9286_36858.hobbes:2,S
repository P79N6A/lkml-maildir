Without looking at it, what I think would be sensible is something that's
a read-only version of the sysctl stuff -- so we have a syscall, /and/ simply
formatted files in proc (probably just a single value per file). That way
the glibc people are happ(y|ier), and Mr. parsons can sit around attempting
to eliminate fork bombs by reading unchangeable values from files in /proc <g>
