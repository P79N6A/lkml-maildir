Yes ...
But that would be a nightmare in terms of support calls.  Take
two USB trees, and swap the hub ... suddenly one of the downstream
devices (the full speed one) starts (or stops!) working!  That's
not the sort of issue any support line wants to cope with on a
day-to-day basis.
The accounting for those products is often along the lines of:
if you got a support call, you didn't profit from that sale.
(And from the user perspective it's just a PITA and waste of
time.)  So *every* confusion like that one gets removed.
