Yes, I know. You need to touch the memory before it is really allocated.

It's not supposed to do that, AIUI - malloc() will only succeed if either
(a) overcommit_memory is enabled (which disables all sanity checking - you
want 2Gb on a 4Mb 386? Here it is...) OR (b) the system stands a *chance*
of successfully allocating it (i.e. it has the amount you requested free).
It doesn't ALLOCATE that memory to you immediately - but it is supposed to
check that it could do, if needed. (So the source appears to indicate,
anyway.)
