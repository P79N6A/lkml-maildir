Larry, thanks for pursuing this. I upgraded to 2.6.24-rc6 last night and
I don't see this issue anymore. One might think that the clean remake
solved the problem (which I am pretty sure I did with rc5 as well); but 
still does not explain with 2.6.24-rc5, the module would not load on 
first attempt but then load after the manual:
# rmmod ssb;modprobe b43
Best regards,
