The IKD info is been very useful. I just noticed and fixed the leak. The
bug is a _design_ bug. There was a performance optimization that make tons
of sense in a dynamic (shrinkable) structure but it's completly bogus in a
not shrinkable sturcutre like the inode pool is. 
Here the fix against 2.2.1:
