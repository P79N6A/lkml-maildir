distribution --> Redhat 5.2
kernel --> 2.2.6 + raid-0421199 patches, SMP enabled
Hardware --> Dell 2300, dual pentium II, 8 SCSI disks hanging off of 
		Adaptec 7890 controller on the motherboard
After subjecting the raid to my own testing, and hearing positive
comments from others I moved to this kernel. The machine is being used 
as the central file server for Solaris and Linux clients. I have no
problem with raid, but NFS is not able to stay up more than
2 to 3 hours. Right now, I am running a small shell script which restarts 
the NFS when it dies. 
I tried the knfsd-1.2.2a, but it kept freezing the kernel. So I had to
move to the old userland NFS. 
    (1)	Now that the raid code is reasonably stable, 
	are there any plans to move the raid patches to 
	move into the official kernel real soon ( 2.2.8 or 2.2.9 let us say)
    (2)	My experience with knfsd is contrary to what I heard from others
	on the net. Could it be due to SMP? 
There is pressure on me to move the NFS server to Solaris, perhaps
for a very good reason. I would appreciate any coments.
