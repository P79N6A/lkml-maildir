You mean the other places in rt_mutex_adjust_prio_chain?  It already
checks once an iteration, anything more is just over kill.

Actually, I always thought that running PREEMPT_DESKTOP with soft and hard
IRQS as threads was priority ceiling.  It's just that all locks have the
priority of MAX_RT_PRIO (no preemption allowed).  OK, this doesn't apply
to mutexes, but it does apply for spin_locks. :)
