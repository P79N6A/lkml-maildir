	It looks like the download page
(
http://www.linux1394.org/download.html
) is out of date:
"See below for how to apply patches. 
                   patch for 2.2.16-2.2.19 (released 2001-05-27) 
                   patch for 2.4.2-2.4.4 (released 2001-05-22) 
                   No patch is needed for newer 2.4 kernels and 2.5. Get 
the latest version of this series or use svn."
	I couldn't find a branches directory in the nightly tarball 
link at 
http://www.linux1394.org/viewcvs/trunk/?root=Linux
+IEEE-1394 .
	Obviously I'm doing something wrong. :-)
	Is there some page on linux1394 which contains either a tar of the 
current 2.4 tree or a the most recent patch against 2.4?
	My sincere thanks for all your work and help.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
