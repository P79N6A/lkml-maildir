The spec actually doesn't mention PNP0C01/PNP0C02. It's hard to say this
is valid or invalid. 
The 'try _HID first then _CID' has another downside. It highly depends
on the driver is loaded first and then load the device. See motherboard
driver loads first and the mem hotplug driver isn't loaded, in this
situation if you scan the mem hotplug device, the mechanism will fail as
the two pass search will still bind motherboard driver to the device.
If you take the two pass search, I have a feeling this will make acpi
never be able to convert Linux driver model.
If you really want to workaround the issue, I prefer have a blacklist or
something to let ACPI not use the _CID for your device, but please don't
mess the ACPI core itself.
