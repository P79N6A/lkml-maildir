   I think this is confusing; in a sentence about SMP, I expect to
   hear how many processors are supported...is that 64 now? I'd
   thought it was 16, actually (and had wondered which cpu/mboard
   allows more than 4).
It supports 32 cpus on Sunfire systems and 64 cpus on Starfire
systems... I believe the company you work for makes these machines :-)
