I've now done some more research into this, and the problem is that
the size of the kernel is stored near the end of the boot sector, as
per the following extract from arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S =>
 Q> .org 497
 Q> setup_sects:
 Q> 	.byte SETUPSECS
 Q> root_flags:
 Q> 	.word CONFIG_ROOT_RDONLY
 Q> syssize:
 Q> 	.word SYSSIZE
 Q> swap_dev:
 Q> 	.word SWAP_DEV
 Q> ram_size:
 Q> 	.word RAMDISK
 Q> vid_mode:
 Q> 	.word SVGA_MODE
 Q> root_dev:
 Q> 	.word ROOT_DEV
 Q> boot_flag:
 Q> 	.word 0xAA55
Note the following lines in the above:
 Q> syssize:
 Q> 	.word SYSSIZE
This word stores the kernel size in 16-byte paragraphs, thus
restricting the kernel to be not more than 0xFFFF0 bytes in length.
That is the limit in question.
Based on your comments, I would assume that syslinux doesn't use that
word, which makes sense as it can obtain the kernel size from the
kernel file itself as it runs on a fully booted system. However, lilo
(and other similar bootloaders) that run as part of the hardware boot
process don't have that ability.
I'm looking into a patch to sort this out, and my current thoughts are
along the lines of the following:
 Q> .org 493
 Q> kernel_size:
 Q>	.word SYSSIZE_LOW
 Q>	.word SYSSIZE_HIGH
 Q> setup_sects:
 Q> 	.byte SETUPSECS
 Q> root_flags:
 Q> 	.word CONFIG_ROOT_RDONLY
 Q> syssize:
 Q> 	.word 0xFFFF
 Q> swap_dev:
 Q> 	.word SWAP_DEV
 Q> ram_size:
 Q> 	.word RAMDISK
 Q> vid_mode:
 Q> 	.word SVGA_MODE
 Q> root_dev:
 Q> 	.word ROOT_DEV
 Q> boot_flag:
 Q> 	.word 0xAA55
Note that the current syssize variable holds a 'magic' value that is
used to indicate that the quadbyte labelled kernel_size holds the
actual kernel length. Basically, if syssize holds any value other than
0xFFFF then the current method is used, but the presence of 0xFFFF in
that word causes the new method to be used.
Comments?
Best wishes from Riley.
