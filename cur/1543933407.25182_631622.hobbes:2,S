If you use the register* functions of the driver model then
you are no longer in 100% control when your functions are
called.
So of the principle of least suprise it is best to use __devinit
for the probe function as most other drivers do. And if
the driver model happens to call your probe function after
init time then we will not oops.
So wit other words - use same pattern a other drivers and accept
that we could have saved a few hundred bytes extra but we do not do so.
