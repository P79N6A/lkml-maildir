Sure your original question was about how to properly stop
a kernel thread prior to module removal. This, I showed you.
Now you say you "prefer" to do it some other way. Good luck.
Unless your code runs exactly like the prototype that the
new macros were written for, you may have fix the macros.

need to do it "your" way. Fine.
