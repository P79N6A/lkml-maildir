On the subject of blacklists -- when downgrading the speed of a drive 
because it's found a blacklist, or indeed for any other reason, please 
_print_ the reason for doing so. 
I have drives which work fine at UDMA66, but which some kernels randomly 
refuse to configure above UDMA33 without telling me why. 
Basically, any time you run a drive at a transfer speed lower than the 
minimum of the drive's and host's listed capabilities, you should say why 
you're doing so.
