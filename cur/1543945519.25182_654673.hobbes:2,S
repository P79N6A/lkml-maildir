Well, it explodes there :) I can not exactly decode the source line,
but it's either list corruption or something is fiddling with an
enqueued timer.

Quel, can you please compile the kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y ?
Then after a crash, pick the address:

----------^^^^^^^^
and run it through:
# addr2line -e vmlinux c0131f3e
Please also enable CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y, which should catch the place
where a list corruption happens.
