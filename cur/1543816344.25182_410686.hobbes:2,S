Interesting, I had not noticed this previously.
There are similarities to what I am doing.
The difference is that a conditional wait allows a caller
to wait for one or more 'bits' (in my specific case one
or more signal transitions) with a single wait call.
The caller wakes when at least one of the conditions is met.
wake_up_bit does not directly allow communicating state back
to the waiter, because the only state the waiter is interested
in is defined in the wait_on_bit call.
A concise description of the conditional wait is that each
wait queue implements an event type where additional wake
discrimination is provided by an arbitrary input data field.
The same data field allows arbitrary per waiter state to be passed back
to the waiter. Interpretation of the input and output data
is specific to an event type and the associated waiter/waker code.
In my case I use this facility to allow a waiter to say:
wait for one or more specific GPIO transitions
and tell me the state of all GPIO when at least
one of the specified transitions occur.
