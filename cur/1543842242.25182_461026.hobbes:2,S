You can check the From: or envelope sender against the subscriber 
database. Forgery isn't a concern because we're not trying to stop 
forgery with this method. Subscribers subscribing one address and sending 
from another is also not a problem since a lookup failure just means you 
get to ride through the bogofilter. Note as well that #4 is a separate 
program; this lookup is likely done by the mailing list software.
#1 should significantly reduce the load on the bogofilter (not sure if 
that matters though).

The perl script behaves as an optional autoresponder. Autoresponders would 
respond to spam as well (well, unless you put a spam filter in front of 
them, but I assume that many don't).
Also note that a number of people (myself included, at work anyway) have 
perl scripts that respond to all incoming mail and require a reply cookie from original 
envelope senders. We do it because it almost entirely prevents spam from 
arriving in our inboxes (I say almost because there is the occasional 
spammer that doesn't forge their sender address and has some kind of 
autoresponder behind it). I had to do this for my work account to stop the
hundreds of messages I was getting each day after a co-worker "pranked me" 
by signing me up for all that crap.
Thanks,
Chase
