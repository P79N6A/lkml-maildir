Hi!
Seems like the mail service I used before has yet a few more nasty
habits I didn't know about until now... *aaargh!* Hopefull, this one
works better.
I'll post a more readable version of the Audiality (low latency audio
processing) info if people had problems with the original one.
Sorry for wasting bandwidth...
