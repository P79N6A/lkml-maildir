Hello Alan,
Can you point to some source where you got the below information:
: At least in the USA the patent requirements and royalties make it
impractical
: to do WAP clients. Apache can be told the wap mime types but remember if
you
: are operating the server in the USA you may need to pay about $10K/year to
: run your server.
Concerning the client side, it seems very logical that the mobile companies 
will be paying a client license (or some part of your usage bill) for the 
browser.  But for the server, www.wapforum.com consistantly states that it 
is an open standard and only refers to requirements for using their logo on 
your server.
Sincerely,
John

one

: that Mozilla will support WAP although I guess the patents killed that
