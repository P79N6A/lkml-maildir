   Actually, this is just using the pte_free_fast() and
   {get,free}_pgd_fast() functions on non-pae machines.
   
Rofl, you can't just do that.  The page tables cache caches the kernel
mappings and if you don't update them properly on SMP you die.
I am seeing reports of SMP failing with rmap12 but not previous
patches.  You need to revert this I think.
