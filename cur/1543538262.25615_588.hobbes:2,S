Does it reboot in 2.4.0-test3-pre2? 2.4.0-test1? other 2.3's?
Does it work in 2.2.16?
smbfs currently has more fixes/changes in 2.2 than it does in 2.3/2.4.
It's perfectly possible that smbfs in 2.4 needs a few things before it is
useable.
I have some OS/2 & cache thing I had planned to try and fix in 2.2 before
looking at upgrading 2.4-test.
