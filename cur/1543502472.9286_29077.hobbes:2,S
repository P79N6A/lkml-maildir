Hello!
> Could you please explain a bit ? 
dev->flags is not atomic variable. Now all its changes are
serialized via global lock.
If you change it from interrupt, this change can interrupt
administrative change and you will lose the change on UP (harmless),
or even corrupt flags on SMP.

New variable dev->link_state, which should be atomic or
at least modified under some interrupt(or only BH) safe lock.
