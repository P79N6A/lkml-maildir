Yes, I made a mistake, please forget that point.
But another statement I made should be valid.
That is how to use geographical address to
locate corresponding acpi object.
For example,  ACPI define IDE as the following:
Device (IDE0){ /* primary controller */
	Name (_ADR, 0)
	Method (_GTM )
	...
	Device(PRIM) /* primary adapter */
		Name (_ADR, 0)
		Method(_GTM)
		...
		Device(MSTR) /* master channel */
			Name (_ADR,0)
			Method(_GTF)
  We need not only able to locate acpi object IDE0
but also we need to locate object PRIM underneath
IDE0,  and MSTR underneath PRIM. Thus, IDE driver 
can fully take advantage from ACPI, in terms of 
configuration and power management.
  Maybe we need to invent a method called
map_device_addr_to_acpi_handle to be  generic solution.
Thanks,
Luming
