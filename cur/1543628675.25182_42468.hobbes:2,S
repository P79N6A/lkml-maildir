This patch adds a help text to arch/ia64/Config.help.
The CONFIG_IA64_GRANULE_16MB choice option is under the "Kernel hacking"
section for the IA64 arch.  Here is a snippet from arch/ia64/config.in:
choice 'Physical memory granularity'                            \
        "16MB                   CONFIG_IA64_GRANULE_16MB        \
         64MB                   CONFIG_IA64_GRANULE_64MB" 64MB
The help text was based loosely on the one found in 2.4.19-pre7 Configure.help.
