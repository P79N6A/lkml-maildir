  (Executive, aka Andrew, summary: no action items here yet ...)
Christoph sent me some corrections offline to my previous post.
I (pj) had written:

I had misunderstood Christoph's patch.  He never intended to fix the
cpuset induced failure of memory migration.  He intended to restore 
proper behavior of the slab allocator and other kernel subsystems.
Part of my confusion arose from the fact that he took the occassion of
his patch to ask Andrew to drop an earlier patch of ours that -had-
intended, in part, to fix this cpuset-migration interaction.
And part of my confusion was just plain old confusion on my part.

I won't get that far.  I'm still working with Christoph offline to make
sense of this.  Hopefully I won't drive him to drink first ;-).
I still hope to have a much improved, agreed to by Christoph, patch to
fix the cpuset-migration interaction, posted to lkml in a day or two.
