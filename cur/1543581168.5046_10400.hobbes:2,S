That's where readaround buffers come into play.  If we have a fixed number
of readaround buffers that are used when small ios are issued, they should
provide a low overhead means of substantially improving things like find
(which reads many nearby inodes out of order but sequentially).  I need to
implement this can get cache hit rates for various workloads. ;-)

Definately.  I'd like to be able to issue readaheads with a "don't bother
executing if this request unless the cost is low" bit set.  It might also
be helpful for heavy multiuser loads (or even a single user with multiple
processes) to ensure progress is made for others.
