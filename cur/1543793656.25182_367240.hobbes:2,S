And that's how we implement this.
The difference is that the pidrange-id is assigned on the fly,
that is when the virtual server is created or recreated after restart.
This, as described in my previous note, is more scalable, because I don't have
to do a global pidrange partitioning.
global pidrange partitioning has implications, for instance what if I simply
want to freeze an app only to restart it much later. This would freeze that
range autmatically.
On process restart, we force fork to use a particular <pidspace/pid> for its
kernel pid assignment, rather then searching for a free one.
