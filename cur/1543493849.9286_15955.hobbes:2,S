Heres an addition for the SIG11-FAQ.
Many (most?) motherboard chipsets cannot handle mixed memory types or speeds.
Sometimes the manufacturer explicitly states this in the manual.
But often they do not.
And sometimes even when the chipset supports it properly, the BIOS doesnt
set it up correctly anyway!
Intel and VIA also make bold claims about some of their chipsets
supporting mixed memory (eg 440bx, mvp3).
I am not 100% sure I trust them B)
Mismatched memory is a likely cause of many sig11's out there.
