It uses its localtime. If it used UTC, you do not have to play these
stupid plays, as whole kernel thinks in UTC.

Whole problem is caused by DOS/Windows, which expects that server is using
localtime, so you have to adjust for that. Unfortunately, for NW older than
4.0 it was possible to say that server runs in UTC and DOS clients are broken.
But with NW4/NW5, which knowns what UTC time is, you cannot say such
thing anymore - NCP protocol uses server localtime and now you have written
it down black on white by Novell.

When server creates file, it assigns current server time as ctime/mtime/atime
to that file (and atime is handled by server completely). So you have
to have some relation between UTC and server localtime. And there is no
way to find such relation, except asking server what's the time just now...

utc2local is used when time is transmitted to server. Otherwise
local2utc is used, for example in inode.c:ncp_update_inode2 -> 
-> dir.c:dos2unix -> dir.c:local2utc

If I do
   touch remote/asd
   umount remote
   mount remote
   ls -l remote/asd
I'll get back correct time. Unfortunately, for some unknown reason when
I have TZ=CET, kernel's tz_minuteswest is -120 instead of correct -60
(correct me if I'm wrong...), so although I see correct 18:06 from Linux,
DOS WS see 19:06. If you have lanalyzer, you can see that reply returned
to create from server contains 18:06 - altough GMT is 17:06, so returned
time is local, not UTC.

They are same from your point of view, but time really stored on server
in one zone will be way different from another server. Face it, these
times are local to server, they are neither UTC nor your local workstation
time.

But your assumption is wrong.

There is no way. There was proposed couple of times fix to change tz_dsttime
meaning from meaningless DST_NONE/DST_USA/DST_AUST... to something
more meaningful, like current offset between localtime and GMT or
between localtime and GMT+tz_minuteswest.

Currently times are constant and correct from Linux view. If I find whether
ntpd4 or who sets tz_minuteswest incorrectly (btw it is debian-woody), times 
will match to DOS workstations during non-DST time.

OK.

This behavior of ncpfs was there before...

Simple structure... glibc parses TZ data to array of 68 (2038-1970) pairs
containing each year start DST and end DST. If you want to be really perfect,
you can change it to 2*68 pairs of {tz_offset, start_date} as I heard that
there is some timezone which has three steps during year...

Yes. If you want cross-timezones mounts correctly. They are incorrect now
and noone complains...

I hope no. But if you decide to implement (4), you do not have to implement
syscall for (3)...

It is simple loop (off by one errors possible):
   /* tzarray is part of superblock when filesystem does not use
      UTC... */
   struct { unsigned int start; int tz_offset; } tzarray[500] = 
     { 0, -60 },  /* before 1978 there was no DST here in our country */
     { 30.3.1978 01:00, -120 }, /* ... */
     { 29.9.1978 00:00, -60 }, /* ... */
     ...
     { 0xFFFFFFFF, -60 } /* last region */
     
   for (ent = tzarray+1; time_to_convert > tzarray->start; tzarray++);
   converted_time = (--tzarray)->tz_offset;

Probably function name is misleading. Both utc2local & local2utc functions
in ncpfs should be named utc2server & server2utc, as converting time from
UTC back to localtime is task for your glibc.
