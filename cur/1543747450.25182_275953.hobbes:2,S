I'll strace that and see what else I can find. Now I'm partially
completing requests when this problem occurs it does seem somewhat
happier. The original code when I took it to bits was just blindingly
failing the lot.

Thats what I was assuming looking at the code. Really the block layer is
broken here. It should not be whining about I/O errors on readahead
blocks just letting them go. It has no idea if the readahead is a
badblock a media feature or whatever. (or as James added on irc scsi
reservations).
