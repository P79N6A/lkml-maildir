Please add this patch to put my name in the CREDITS file.  I've
submitted a few bugfix patches which have been incorporated into 2.4.X
kernels as well as a PAS16 doc file for the sound subsystem.  It was
submitted once before, but hasn't made it yet.  Patch is against
2.4.0test5.  Thanks in advance.
