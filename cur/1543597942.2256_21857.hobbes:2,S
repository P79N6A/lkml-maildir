Hi tristan;
kernel 0.01 is well before my Linux time, so I can't help with that at all.
What I can suggest is that you get a version fo Redhat up and running on your
PC.    Then install find a Virtual Machine system that will allow you to install
another version of linux that you can run in a VM session.    Use this image as
your learning environment.    All that having been said, do understand that I've
never done this, so others may have comments that are more relavant.
MY thoughts are these:
First; the kernel is constant being updated.   Your best bet to get relavant help
with any thing is to be working on current sources.
Second; many of the tools that are shipped with Linux are vastly improved in
thier later revisions.   Using these tools should result in an over all better
experience.
Third; the quality of the kernel is constantly improving.   This improved kernel
should serve as a solid base to learn about operating systems on.
Thanks
Dave
