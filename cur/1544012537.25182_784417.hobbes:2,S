I applied the patch and get the following:
ata2: XXX status=50 after 100 tries
ata2.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen
ata2.00: ST_FIRST: !(DRQ|ERR|DF)

I tried to git bisect the problem. First time I thought the error was 
between rc2 and rc3,
but the bisect gave inconclusive results because I couldn't tell for 
sure a good commit from a bad.
I tried again with .27 to .28-rc3, but I was unable to bisect because of 
compile errors (in pre-rc1),
and doing git bisect skip, again landed on a commit with compile errors.
Unless you can think of anything else, I'm just going to wait and see if 
a commit in .29 will fix the problem.
