Dear all,
I have a question about the kernel used by the RedHat. I am using Redhat 7.0
and upgrade the Linux Kerenl from their original 2.2.16 to 2.2.18. But when
I compile some modules, it said my kernel is 2.4.0. I check the
/usr/include/linux/version.h as follows, found that it shows I am using
Kernel 2.4.0.
#include <linux/rhconfig.h>
#if defined(__module__smp)
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.4.0-0.26smp"
#else
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.4.0-0.26"
#endif
#define LINUX_VERSION_CODE 132096
#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) << 16) + ((b) << 8) + (c))
 But when I "cat /proc/version", it will give me:
Linux version 2.2.18-rtl (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux
(egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 Thu Apr 5 23:10:12 EDT 2001
So I am totally confused by the RedHat. So could you please tell me how to
solve this problem?
I just want to use the 2.2.18 without the 2.4.0. I did not install this one,
I also do not know where this one comes from.
Thanks in advance.
Hai Xu
