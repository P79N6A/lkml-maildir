I've measured this now... Without many debug CONFIGs (in v2.6.25-rc2-mm1), 
the dev_alloc_skb is much less than 23kB:
    382 funcs, 157 +, 12335 -, diff: -12178 --- dev_alloc_skb
    dev_alloc_skb                 |  +37
...and on top of that, I got only this:
    48 funcs, 111 +, 836 -, diff: -725 --- __dev_alloc_skb
Not that impressive compared with many much worse cases (wasn't a big 
surprise because there were fewer callsites for the latter).
Anyway, would I uninline it (or one some another function that has such 
two variants that are good candidates for uninlining), should I try to 
avoid deepening the call-chain by two functions? To me it seems that only 
way to fool gcc to do that for sure would be using some trick like this:
Rename __dev_alloc_skb to ___dev_alloc_skb in the header (with appropriate
don't ever call this due to bloat comment added) and both __dev_alloc_skb 
and dev_alloc_skb could then be made to call that one in .c file. 
Otherwise I'm not that sure gcc wouldn't try to be too clever if I just 
use inline in .c file.
