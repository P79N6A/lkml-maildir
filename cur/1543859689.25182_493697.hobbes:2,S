This doesn't look right.  This is the kernel's %fs, not usermode's
(which should be 0).

Hm.  This shouldn't be possible since this is a bad selector, but I
guess ptrace/gdb doesn't really know that.  If you run the target (even
single step it), these should revert to 0.

Don't think this is quite right yet.  Assuming the %gs->%fs patch has
been applied, then the target %fs should be on its stack, and target %gs
will be in thread.gs.  I'm not sure that thread.fs has any use, but I'd
want to double check vm86 to be sure.
