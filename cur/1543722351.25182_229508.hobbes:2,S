It means checksum is not used when scsi_mod is compiled statically.
I think it is very important to check the checksum before dump starts.
The most serious problem of dumping to the disk is that dumping may 
overwrite parts of filesystem and destroy user data. This problem
happens when data structures or codes which is used during dumping are
broken.
Diskdump solves this problem by the following methods.
a) Using module checksum, check whether codes (and data) are broken.
b) Confirm whether the target device is really dump device, by checking
   that target device is rightly formatted.
Therefore, checking the checksum is necessary before dumping. scsi_dump
always needs to be compiled as module. So I said it is difficult to
merge scsi_dump with scsi_mod.
