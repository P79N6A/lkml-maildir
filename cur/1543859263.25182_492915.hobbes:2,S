So I hacked up a few very ugly 'find|egrep' to look for some cases of that, and
found:
./include/asm-arm/arch-ebsa110/hardware.h:18: * Region 0 (addr = 0xf0000000 + io << 2)
Only one odd-looking use of +-*/ and <</>> - and it's in a comment.
And that's using a pattern like '\+[^,()=]*<<' (basically, any plus sign that
has a << after it, but no comma parens or equals to force grouping in between), and
then using /bin/eyeball to filter the resulting several hundred lines.
I admit I didn't try to catch expressions split over multiple lines, and
something of the form "foo * bar + (a-b) << 2" would have snuck by (but I
suspect if somebody bothered doing the (a-b), they would have another pair).
So either that sort of thing isn't really an error we make often, or the
reviewers are very good at catching it, or I'm a lot worse at finding them
than I thought I was... :)
