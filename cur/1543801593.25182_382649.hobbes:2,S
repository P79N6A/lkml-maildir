You misread.  Most people just want to have things work like they
should have for years.  Technical people, at least Marcin and I, want
a documented kernel interface with optional libraries over it (think
libX11 vs. the X Protocol, or glibc/klibc/uclibc/libc5 vs. the system
calls), and then behind that have the kernel route the data to
userspace demon(s) or the hardware depending on root-level setup and
configuration.
ALSA does not have a documented kernel interface nor an optional
library but a mandatory library.  A highly complex, ipc-using library
with no security audit that I could find with google.  A library for
which people do not seem to care about compatibility with previous or
future kernel versions, which means it _has_ to be shared.  And shared
libraries are just unacceptable in some contexts, like distributing
binaries outside of a specific linux distribution[1].
At least OSS, with all its flaws, is a documented kernel interface.
You can static link a oss-using program, whether it uses it directly
or through interfaces like sdl-audio, and it will just work.
  OG.
[1] And that does not necessarily means commercial and/or proprietary.
"Just recompile" does not always work either, think missing libraries,
headers, and version drift (snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_near anybody?).
