2.4 will give up merging faster than 2.6, elevator_linus will stop
looking for a merge point if the sequence drops to zero. 2.6 will always
merge. So that could explain the fewer writes.

I think that's pretty similar. Andrew didn't say what device he was
testing on, but 2.4 ide defaults to max 64k where 2.6 defaults to 128k.

Andrew, you did numbers for deadline previously as well, but no rq
statistics there? As for nr_requests that's true, would be worth a shot
to bump available requests in 2.6.
