Hi,
Segher suggested a better implementation that did a read-modify-write
sequence.  I tested a few different combinations of these rebooting
approaches, and found that each one individually correctly rebooted
my headless machine (Biostar iDEQ 210M with VIA PM800 + VT8237 chipset).
A = original "pulse reset low"
B = my patch that sets the system flag (with possibly bad assumptions about other flags)
C = Segher's read-modify-write to set only the system flag.
So, the bad news is that I no longer have a baseline test
(because A works for me now).  I updated the bios a while ago,
and this is a different physical machine than the others I
was testing last year (which are now in production and I
cannot use to test), although the model is the same.
So, if you want to revert my patch all together, that's fine.
I think a foolproof reboot sequence would be A followed by C.
So here is my recommendation, which I have verified works on
my current machine :
Thanks,
-Truxton
