How exactly does a system to tracking patches and bugs/fixes (not to
mention helping Linus and Ted) not help developers?  In other words,
it is meant to help all three entities.
Anyway, I understand your request, but it's not my call.  Obviously,
it's better if patches successfully apply to the live tree the first
time, but aside from that, it doesn't have much effect on the
mechanics of the patch management system.
