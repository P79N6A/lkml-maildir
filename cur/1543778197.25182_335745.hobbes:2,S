I changed the protocol to TCP and changed rsize and wsize to 1024.  I
don't know which of those fixed it, but I'm going to leave it for now.
As for MTU, yeah, the Watchguard box seems to have some hard-coded
limits, and for whatever reason KDE and GNOME graphical logins do
something that exceeds those limits, completely independent of NFS,
and hang up hard.
Thanks.
