To clarify:
We are discussing a scheme where the underlying SELinux labeling policy 
always ensures a safe label on a file, and then relabeling newly created 
files according to their pathnames.
There is no expectation that this scheme would be submitted for 
certification.  Its purpose is to merely to provide pathname-based 
labeling outside of the kernel.
