Yes, but page faults are expensive too. Each time a page is written
out it needs to be marked read only again and will cause a page fault
for the next write access from userspace. For certain workloads this
can easily add up to more than copy_(to|from)_user in read/write.
read/write also gives you more explicit control on IO batching and
scheduling (when to read or write). Less need for the kernel to employ
tricks to effectively coaslesce IOs on dirtied pages or sense
streaming access patterns.
