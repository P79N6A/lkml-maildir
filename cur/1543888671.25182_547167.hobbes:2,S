Better don't ask. Now I'm far less decided, than yesterday.

You should talk to some English-speaking person who learns Polish.
It's hard to believe, but there are such people. (They could be 
sometimes seen in our TV - it's a real stunt!)
I prefer to fix C too, and I'm far from beeing the right person
to do this (I don't care much about "unlogical" languages), but
I like the style of your manual, and I think it's too good to
leave small spots here.
I think, there is some time till tomorrow (or even leave something
for another patch).
BTW, did I write about resending "yesterday"?
This time saving really works...
Cheers,
