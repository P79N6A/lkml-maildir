Just re-compiling LILO with the  COMMAND_LINE_SIZE  parameter changed 
from 256 to 512 will not work.  A .bss area must be moved to avoid 
clobbering the kernel header.

For the last 8 years LILO has used 0x02 as the loader ID.
If anyone wishes to test a version of LILO that is able to pass a 512 
byte command line, then the "22.7.2-beta8" version in the "beta" 
directory should be tried.  It moves the offending ".bss" area to 
avoid the header clobber.  However, I have not yet changed the loader ID.
