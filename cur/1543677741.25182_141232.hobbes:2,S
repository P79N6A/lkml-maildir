Actually I'm the culprit.

hmm, OK, it doesn't even vaguely work in journalled mode either...
I think the check should be implemented in (the new) ext3_open().  Because
checking the return from open() is the way in which a good application would
determine whether the underlying fs supports O_DIRECT.
Unfortunately O_DIRECT can also be set with fcntl(F_SETFL), and we seem to
have forgotten to provide a way for the fs to be told about fcntl.
