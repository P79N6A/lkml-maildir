Okay.

It seems Alexander already covered removal of wrappers...

You can't remove them.

ide_probe_for_cmd640x() should be still be used instead.
By removing setup_device_ptrs() and moving this driver to generic PCI layer,
you broke support for VLB version of CMD640.
Also there is a comment in a cmd640.c:
/*
 * The CMD640x chip does not support DWORD config write cycles, but some
 * of the BIOSes use them to implement the config services.
 */
which worries me that it might be not safe to move this driver to generic
IDE PCI layer (at least for now).

Is this really necessary, it is even harder to read it now...
Stefan, please rework your patch.  Thanks.
