This is works fine with plain "mount", except that the mount isn't
hidden from others.  Why hide it?  Permissions can be used to prevent
others from looking at the mounted stuff if need be.  I.e. put
the mountpoint in a directory not readable by others, or
have the root of that fs unreadable by others.
