Wel i think i am going to open up this machine to and reorganize the scsi 
cards so that all the information is directly one after the other because
i had a look behind that machine the current cards (pci) is scsi,vga,scsi
and i wil try to make it scsi,scsi,vga but ik wil be in the weekend when
i wil have the time to test this out.
