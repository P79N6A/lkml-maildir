Subject: Usermode NFS - still in existence ?

Hello,
I have a system running a vendor supplied kernel that I do not have the
ability to change.  Further, it is modified enough that normal modules
will not load into it - and of course I cannot compile modules to work
with it since I don't have the source to the kernel.
And for some reason they did not compile NFS in.
And I need this system to be an NFS _client_.
What are my options ?  I see that at some point there was a usermode NFS
... does this still exist ? Is there some other way of mounting an NFS
volume from userland - really any solution is fine, I just need to mount
my nfs volume from this server.
thanks!
