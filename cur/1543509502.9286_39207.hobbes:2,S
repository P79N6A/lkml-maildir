Hmmm, that would change the POSIX definition of the call. You have to
create a new system call sigwait_bunch_of_infos() or something. :)
This stuff is real tricky in a multithreaded app, where you might want to
dequeue siginfo's in multiple threads. Not that this is possible with the
current Linux implementation of POSIX threads....
