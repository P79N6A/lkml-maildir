I'd try the 3ware.  AC and others have reported good
throughput and, at least compared to SCSI, they aren't that
expensive and claim to support JBOD.  I just checked on
pricewatch and the 7506-4 can be had for about $250US and
the eight port for about $375.  Older models can be had for
less.  When the economy picks back up enough to improve my
bank ballance i'm planning to buy a few.
