Yes.  However this isn't the issue I'm concerned with at the moment.

Sorry, I only posted the startup bit - the same does indeed happen on
shutdown, however I wasn't interested in it for the purposes of the
tests.
The key point I was trying to put across was that I can't get the
seeding process to work.  No matter what I wrote to /dev/urandom on
startup, the output from reading /dev/urandom immediately afterwards
was the same (ignoring the occasional variation that I put down to
timing).  As I understand it (from man 4 random and the boot script
examples), writing to /dev/[u]random should increase the amount of
entropy, thereby altering the output from the PRNG.

When did Matt take over?  From my experiments it would appear as
though the time is having an effect on the output, though as I say I'm
not totally sure.
