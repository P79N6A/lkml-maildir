Well, file systems have for all time made efforts to write things
out contiguously.  If an IO system were to come along and deoptimise
that case it'd be pretty broken?

hum. Yes.  Copying a tree from and to the same disk won't
achieve disk bandwidth.  If they're different disks then
ext2+Orlov will actually get there.
We in fact do extremely well on IDE with Orlov for this workload,
even though we're not doing inter-inode readahead.  This will be because
the disk is doing the readhead for us.   It's going to be highly dependent
upon the disk cache size, readahead cache partitioning algorithm, etc.
BTW, I've been trying to hunt down a suitable file system aging tool.
We're not very happy with Keith Smith's workload because the directory
infomation was lost (he was purely studying FFS algorithmic differences
- the load isn't 100% suitable for testing other filesystems / algorithms).  Constantin Loizides' tools are proving to be rather complex to compile,
drive and understand.  Does the XFS team have anything like this in the
kitbag?
