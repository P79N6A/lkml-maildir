Hummm, I just tried that .config with a vanilla 2.6.19.3 and it built 
just fine.
So either you have some patches that make a difference, or it's a 
binutils version problem.
Can you send the output of scripts/ver_linux to see what binutils 
version you are using?
Also you can try a "make debug_kallsyms" build that creates a .tmp_map1 
and a .tmp_map2 files that might help diagnose the problem.
