Yes. I simply replaced 120 by 600 after which it processed even the
biggest of my fonts scaled to 1000 points, without aborting. But there
might be bigger fonts.
   Note that there are 2 further places where these (wrong) heuristics
are used, and I changed 120 -> 600 there, too (4 times in summary).
This is, however, no elegant solution. The XFree people discuss meanwhile
to replace the whole type1 stuff by the one from freetype2.
