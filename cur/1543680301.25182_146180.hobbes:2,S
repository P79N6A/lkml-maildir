Hi!
I had three diferent CF cards, from two different manufacturers
(Apacer and Transcend), and both died *really fast*.
Last one (transcend) died in less than 10 minutes: mke2fs, cat
/dev/urandom > foo; md5sum foo (few times); cat /dev/urandom > foo and
I could no longer do cat /dev/urandom because of disk errors.
I know CompactFlash cards are *crap*, but they should not be *so*
crappy...?! [I'm testing them from toshiba satellite 4030cdt via
Apacer PCMCIA-to-CF adapter and in sharp zaurus].
Are there "known good" 256MB compact flash cards?
