Ah, you talked about /usr/bin/time? sorry, I misunderstood a bit.
Why time need number of pages?
In general, getrusage()::ru_maxrss is bsd compatibility feature.
as far as possible, the same syscall spec is better.
and bsd use KB unit.
if time command has reasonable reason, I can agree current design.
but is there?
