With iommu=force, my A8V deluxe system crashes during boot.
With iommu=soft swiotlb=force, the skge driver still has problems:
skge 0000:00:0a.0: PCI error cmd=0x157 status=0x22b0
skge unable to clear error (so ignoring them).
Also seen:
skge 0000:00:0a.0: PCI error cmd=0x117 status=0x22b0
The sk98lin driver prints out loads of garbage too fast for me to read
and I can't stop it either (scroll lock doesn't stop it). It's saying
something like "unexpected IRQ status error" - there's also a number
printed which looks like 0x264.
FWIW the e100 driver works fine without either of these options
