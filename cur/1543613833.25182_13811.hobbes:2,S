Not on disk it doesn't. When you're booting from a floppy (distro 
installation, recovery disk, whatever) you only have 1.something Mb to play 
with. Or a network. For that matter, you're complicating CD booting too.

Not "better". More features/bloat - and when they are "features" most of us 
neither need nor want, why bother? Lilo does everything most of us need, and 
does it better than grub or others: same job with fewer resources.

Initramfs will do this, it seems. Alternatively, you might have to copy some 
files into a tarball - oh, the stress! Oh, wait - you just compiled 100+Mb of 
C source to make that kernel and the modules. Somehow, making a tarball out 
of the modules doesn't seem too stressful to me.

OK, make the conf file a shell script which copies the modules into a tarball 
or initrd image.

Feeping creaturism in the bootloader, you mean? Great... while we're at it, 
how about building gcc, make, tar and gzip into the bootloader, along with an 
FTP client, so it can download and compile the kernel to boot? Chuck in a 
copy of emacs, too, for any changes you want?
You're already compiling the modules from C into .o files; what's the big 
deal with copying them into a tarball?!

You're right. Let's drop x86 support, and require everyone to buy a nice new 
POWER4 box from IBM.
