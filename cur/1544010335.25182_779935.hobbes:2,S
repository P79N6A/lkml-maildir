The comment above should be updated according to this change:

Isn't it a dangerous approach to let clients consume for their exclusive usage channels
meant for general-purpose ("pubilc" ones)?
Why not to limit private_candidate to devices with DMA_PRIVATE capability only?

As capabilities are per device, this check could be performed just once
before list_for_each_entry(chan, &dev->channels, device_node).
