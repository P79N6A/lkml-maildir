OK.  My patch wasn't the right approach anyway.  Attached is what I
think we should do instead -- do the preconfig if we're not using PNP.
I need to figure out how to test this though.  The current smsc-ircc2
works on my HP nw8240, but I don't have any indication that it works
on laptops that require preconfiguration.
[patch] smsc-ircc2: skip preconfiguration for PNP devices
If we rely on the device resources from PNPBIOS, we also have to rely on
the BIOS to configure any bridges on the way to the device.
Using the PNPBIOS resources but twiddling the configuration of a
bridge behind the back of the firmware is likely to make things
inconsistent.
With "smsc-ircc2.nopnp", we do the legacy device probe, including
manual bridge preconfiguration, as before.
