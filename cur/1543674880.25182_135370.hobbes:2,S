That would be mindbogglingly ugly. Unfortunately Rusty has still only
half solved the module problem because modules are refcounted as an
"entity" not the module info and the module code/data split into two.
Ie I can't unload a module that has module object references because we
have no way to seperate "I'm talking about module xyz" and "I'm jumping
into module xyz". That IMHO is what is causing much of the remaining
mess.
Were they split then I could safely take a module object reference in
the notifiers and have
	try_inc_mod_count()
do the right thing passed a module handle to a module that is unloaded
but has object references left.
