Sorry, but I must join Russel here. I have atleast one machine which has
a bootloader able to load exactly one file only. There is currently no
way to load an initrd. It would need to implement the whole (BOOTP+)TFTP
stuff again, just to get the initrd. So I was quite happy linux 2.4
still knows about mounting a NFS root filesystem without user-space
help.
