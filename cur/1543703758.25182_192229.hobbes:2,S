Looks like someone has misconfigured this mail server...
It shouldn't be bouncing to everyone sending to the list, and the mailserver
should be looking at the Return-path: header.

I've been getting these error messages in my kernel forever, I think even
with 2.2 kernels, and it's still there in 2.6:
smb_open: config/SAM open failed, result=-26
smb_readpage_sync: config/SAM open failed, error=-26
It does this for several locked system files on the windows machines.
This happens during a find command run on the mounted share from one of my
scripts that compares file dates.
Can these printk calls be removed?
