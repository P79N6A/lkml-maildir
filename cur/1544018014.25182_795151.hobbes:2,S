Ok, I see. It seems a bit of a waste to do a kmalloc for something
that is guaranteed to be just a few bytes, but allocating the
buffer per-device would mean another mutex, which has about the
same overhead, so I'm basically ok with the patch.

GFP_NOIO seems out of place in a network driver: there is nothing
wrong with waiting for I/O here, so plain GFP_KERNEL should be fine.

I'd prefer to write 
	if (!buffer)
here, as I do elsewhere in the driver.
