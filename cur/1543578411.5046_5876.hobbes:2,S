Kernel 2.4.0-prerelease through 2.4.1-pre2
I recently got a Pioneer 105S 16x slot loading DVD drive and have been
getting lots os the following messages when playing dvds and cdroms....
hdb: DSC timeout
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }

Is this possibly specific to slot loading drives? I didn't have problems
with my old Creative 2x dvd drive.
I also saw the following but don;t know what was happening on my machine
at the time.
