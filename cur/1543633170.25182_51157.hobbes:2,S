   On a non-SMP system, would it be OK to map all the memory
   without memory coherency enabled? You seem to be implying that
   one only needs to implement some mechanism in pci_map_single()
   to handle flushing cache lines (write back, then invalidate).
   This would be useful for Macs.
It's just avoiding flushing by effecting flushing the cache after
every load/store the cpu does, so of course it would work.
It would be slow as hell, but it would work.
