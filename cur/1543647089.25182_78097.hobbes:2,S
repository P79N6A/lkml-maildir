I'd love for the acorn ones to go away, but certainly the SCSI one is
needed to get things to happen in the right order (or last time I
tested it which was quite some while ago, scsi still required a specific
init ordering.)
Whatever happens, I'll see about fixing them up once I've caught up with
2.5.41.  Other stuff is taking a back seat while I finish cleaning up
2.5.40 for the ARM people (a fair amount of crap has accumulated since
my previous 2.5.30 release, and those who normally follow what I do will
realise that there's been a very long silence, some would say too long...)
