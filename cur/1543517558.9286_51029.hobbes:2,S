or else keeping shitty PIO hardware out of the kernel.  in this case,
VESA fbcon seems to be even more excremental than PIO IDE ever was.
perhaps we should put up a massive warning whenver a PIO device is 
configured, just so people know that something is drastically wrong.
they can CONFIG_I_KNOW_MY_HARDWARE_IS_OBSOLETE to skip this.  heck,
we can even make the warning full-screen text on a blue background ;)
