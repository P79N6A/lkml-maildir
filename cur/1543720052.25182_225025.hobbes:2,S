Subject: [PATCH][PPC64] Don't clear MSR.RI in do_hash_page_DSI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some code that is used on iSeries (do_hash_page_DSI in head.S) was
clearing the RI (recoverable interrupt) bit in the MSR when it
shouldn't.  We were getting SLB miss interrupts following that which
were panicking because they appeared to have occurred at a bad place.
This patch fixes the problem.  In fact it isn't necessary for
do_hash_page_DSI to do anything to RI, so the patch changes the code
to not set or clear it.

Please apply.
Thanks,
Paul.
