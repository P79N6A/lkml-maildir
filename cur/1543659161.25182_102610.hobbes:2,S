The horrific response to the use of "goto" is deprecated in favor of 
proper use.  A function overloaded with gotos probably should be 
reworked.  But there there is no need to outright avoid the use of 
'goto'.  if()  is simply a conditional test with a goto A or goto B logic.
There is a reason for the implementation of goto.  When it all boils 
down to it, in assembler it's all a matter of JMP with or without a 
condition.
