Hi Andrew, just a copule of problems with kernel 2.6.1-mm1
- artsd running with ALSA gives the error: "CPU overloading, stopping" 
just few seconds after it began to play a song. It's a P4 HT with SMP 
enabled.
- Xfree hang: in a Dell Latitude laptop (P3-M 933), xfree (4.3, last 
version in Debian experimental) hangs and shows a white screen. The 
keyboard is also blocked, but login from the network is still OK. There 
is no any error message. I also see the same effect when I tryed to run 
Xine in full screen mode.
Hope this helps.
