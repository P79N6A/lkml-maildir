Not able to boot a whole partition with grub2. I've seen patch for
grub ... 
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiser4progs/grub-0.97-reiser4-20050808.tar.gz
But I since I'm using grub2, it's not possible to boot directly into
reiser4. I'm only use the whole 250GB partition on my 2nd hard disk
for testing.
I'm as interested as you in looking for grub2 to boot directly.
Currently, I've to create a small ext2 partition for grub2.
Jeff.
