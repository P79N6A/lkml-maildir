Did you try Simons test-case which seemed to be just a "cat" on a floppy 
  "To demonstrate the problem reliably, I've used "strace -r cat" on a
   floppy, which is a sufficiently slow medium. :)  This is on a 2.4.19
   kernel, but 2.5 behaves similarly.")
although that may be different from the NFS issue, it is kind of
interesting: the perfect behaviour would be a steady stream of data, not
too many hickups.
