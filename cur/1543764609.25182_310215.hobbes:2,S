sleep_on() is a fundamentally broken interface, it only works on UP - 
but there it _does_ rely on the behavior your patch removes. (i.e.  
disabled interrupts until we hit schedule())
the PREEMPT_RT kernel makes the limitations of sleep_on() even more 
apparent. The patch only removes the warning, it doesnt remove the race.  
To remove the race, sleep_on() usage should be converted to something 
else. (e.g. one of the wait_event() variants)
