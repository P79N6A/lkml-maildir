That's not the way it worked in previous kernels, and it's not the way that
the current rng-utils RPM in Fedora expects it to work.
Here's a patch that makes it work the way it used to.  Adding the test
for O_NONBLOCK is the biggie - the old code did a resched test at that
point in the loop, so I added it here too.
