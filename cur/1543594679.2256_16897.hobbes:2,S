We should release the stack before running the softirq (some place uses
softirqs to release the stack and avoid overflows).

ip + tcp are more intensive than just queueing a packet in a blacklog.
That's why they're not done in irq context in first place.

I don't have gigabit ethernet so I cannot flood my boxes to death.
But I think it's real, and a softirq marking itself runnable again is
another case to handle without live lockups or starvation.
