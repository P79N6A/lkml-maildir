Subject: Linux-2.4.20: bug with radeonfb
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Environment:	gcc-2.95.4, latest dev tools from Debian "Sarge"( testing )
Kernel:	2.4.20 + patch-2.4.20-ac1 from ftp.kernel.org
Machine:	i386 (intel P4-M/1700 ) / 512MB DDR266, chipset i845MP
Graphics subsystem:	ATI Radeon M7, 64MB DDR
			Samsung LTN-1050 flatpanel, 1400x1050 physical resolution (DVI connection)
First of all, i must congratulate all kernel developers for this wonderful 
work-of-art which Linux is and will continue to be :) Thanks for making 
this world a little better!
On to the point:
"Go's":	
	i845MP chipset supported ( didn't previously work ). ICH3 & co. detected 
and used. Some minor details left, though :)
	UDMA100 enabled and working
"No Go's":
	Radeon M7 AGP:
	- Framebuffer:	unreadable output ( did work _perfectly_ with Linux-2.4.19 ).
	Looks like there's a bug somewhere in the rendering code( kernel 
autodetects and configures a 175x65 framebuffer, as previously):
output seems to be "misplaced" -- might be a little assumption when 
calculating line offsets.
Text lines, although bent to the right( 60º angle or so ), look _extremely 
long_ (might be a wrong appreciation)
"Tux" logo is unrecogniceable too :(
	- DRM 4.1( v20020828 ) works nicely with XFree 4.2.1
	- Xvid extension works
dmesg gives this ( double-checked with 2.4.19 ): relevant sections are 
identical to 2.4.19

Feel free to ask for whatever config detail i might have forgotten to add.
I'm not sure if i will have time enough to contribute (part of) a patch -- 
gotta leave some time for lunch and sleep ;) Wouldn't mind to help, however.
