These things aren't measuring time, or even just cycles, they
are measuring things like L2 cache misses, cpu cycles, and
other similar kinds of events.
So these counters are going to measure all of the damn crap
assosciated with doing the read() call as well as the real work
the task does.
That's not useful to people.
