Mixing "inside" and "before" is a small linguistic clue about
one of the issues with driver model PM.  Off topic here; and
in terms of suspend/resume callback sequencing that answer
shouldn't matter much for HPET (as I understand things).

Yes -- where "platform_device" is a regular Joe-Sixpack kind of
device, but "sysdev" is a special case.

Agreed -- although isn't it the "clockevent" change which is at issue?
A "clockevent" thingie wraps various kinds of timer IRQs; the clocksource
is conceptually just a free run counter.  Clocksources have been around
for a while, with no particular problems.
It's clockevent sources have been the problem with dynamic tick solutions
all along, since they mask such chaos inside x86 hardware and interact
with so many different parts of the kernel.  ;)
