....... Nice one! As the only addition here is debugging output, I can
only assume that the two patches were being booted in isolation instead
of combination earlier. The two threads have been a little confused with
hand waving so that can easily happen.
Looking at your log;

Running CPU associated with node 0 so other than being node 1 instead of
node 2, your machine is similar to the one I had the problem on in terms
of memoryless nodes and CPU configuration.

I see it failed to complete boot but I'm going to assume this is a relatively
normal commane-line, .config or initrd problem and not a regression of
some type.
I'll post a patch suitable for pick-up shortly. The two patches ran in
combination with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB a compile-based stress tests without
difficulty so hopefully there is not new surprises hiding in the corners.
Thanks Olaf.
