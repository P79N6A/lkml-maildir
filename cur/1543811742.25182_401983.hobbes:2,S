Hi Carlos,

Did you observe it?
In the original patch, there is 
+static struct task_struct * select_bad_process(unsigned long *ppoints)
 {
-       unsigned long maxpoints = 0;
        struct task_struct *g, *p;
        struct task_struct *chosen = NULL;
        struct timespec uptime;
+       *ppoints = 0;
And this is called from out_of_memory().
But the constrained_alloc stuff seems to use points before 
select_bad_process() is called, so initializing to 0 is a
good idea. I don't remember having see the constrained_alloc
stuff, though, so I either did not look carefully enough or a 
merge error happened afterwards. 
Thanks for noticing and thanks for sending the fix!
Best,
