linux 2.2.12
Possible bug in ide-cd.c ( ver. 4.53 ).
The capacity as reported by cdrom_read_capacity() is one block too short for
audio CDs on my system. ( Teac CD-532E-B as hdc on PIIX4 , Abit BH-6 board )
This means ( at least ) that the last block can not be read with ioctl CDROMREADAUDIO.
But it can be read as read lba = last-1 , nrblocks = 2 !
I believe in this case the kernel passes the command to the drive and it 
performs the operation without problems.
The checks in ide_cdrom_dev_ioctl() for case CDROMREADAUDIO are weird.
It checks for nframes > capacity ????
It also check for lba >= capacity ( it should be lba > capacity on my system
to work OK with audio CDs )
But it does not check for lba + nframes > capacity  !?
The problem is not present in 2.3.18 , there is note in
drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c , about needing an upper bound check on lba , but
currently it is not checked :-)
The read_toc code in ide-cd.c seems the same as in 2.2.12 though ...
