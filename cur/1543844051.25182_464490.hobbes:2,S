Actually, ASCII trace should output to multiple channels if we use bulk 
mode.  The original idea for keeping ASCII trace (this was the original 
output mechanism) was that a user may have wanted to look at trace 
output information in real-time as it was being printed onto the screen 
(which requires merging all the output channels).  Again, I question the 
usability of this feature and if a user really wanted to look at ASCII 
trace data in real time, a better solution would be for the lket-b2a 
conversion tool to have a mode were it could print the output of 
constantly changing trace buffers to the screen.  The ASCII output mode 
in LKET is cryptic and having lket-b2a do this would perform better and 
produce prettier output while also reducing the trace file output size a 
bit.

Actually, we started doing this six years ago on our internal *static* 
trace tool before we started implementing event tracing using 
SystemTap.  Regardless of whether the tool uses static or dynamic 
probes, if the problem only requires 3 tracepoints to figure out, why 
would you want to activate 50+ hooks.

Look like the example you propose above could also apply to this as 
well.  You could implement some sort of debug mode to the trace data 
that provides extra information useful for debugging the tool.  If the 
information is really only useful when debugging the trace tool during 
development,  wouldn't it make sense to have a way to disable debugging 
junk as needed?
