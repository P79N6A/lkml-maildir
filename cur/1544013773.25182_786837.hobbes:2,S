Subject: Re: [RFC][PATCH 3/10] PCI PM: Power-manage devices without drivers during suspend-resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

> 
> PCI devices without drivers can be put into low power states during
> suspend with the help of pci_prepare_to_sleep() and prevented from
> generating wake-up events during resume with the help of
> pci_enable_wake().  However, it's better not to put bridges into
> low power states during suspend, because that might result in entire
> bus segments being powered off.
