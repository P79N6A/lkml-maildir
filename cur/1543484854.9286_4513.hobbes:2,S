couldnt figure it out. I just edited that atyfb.c and compiled. that is
the dirtiest way to do it imaginable, but have a look at it anyway:
around line 1974 in drivers/video/atyfb.c:
#if 0
struct fb_var_screeninfo default_var = {
    /* 640x480, 60 Hz, Non-Interlaced (25.175 MHz dotclock) */
    640, 480, 640, 480, 0, 0, 8, 0,
    {0, 8, 0}, {0, 8, 0}, {0, 8, 0}, {0, 0, 0},
    0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 39722, 48, 16, 33, 10, 96, 2,
    0, FB_VMODE_NONINTERLACED
};
#else
struct fb_var_screeninfo default_var = {
    /* 1024x768 derived from X modeline */
    /* 94.50 1024 1072 1168 1376 768 769 772 808 +hsync +vsync */
    1024, 768, 1024, 768, 0, 0, 8, 0,
    { 0, 8, 0}, {0, 8, 0}, {0, 8, 0}, {0, 0, 0},
    0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 10613, 200, 56, 36, 1, 96, 3,
    FB_SYNC_HOR_HIGH_ACT|FB_SYNC_VERT_HIGH_ACT, FB_VMODE_NONINTERLACED
};
#endif

huh? XF86_Mach64 has nothing to do with the fb driver. change ur X modeline.
like:
   Modeline "1024x768"  94.50 1024 1072 1168 1376 768 769 772 808 +hsync +vsync

mm. Mine does when switching to X and back. Q < 10.666667 or something.
