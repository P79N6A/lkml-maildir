The whole qc->pad_len etc. machinery was added because it solved 
problems in the field with ATAPI devices.  So sr or some userland 
application is sending lengths that are not padded to 32-bit boundary, 
probably because plenty of trivial commands can send or return odd 
amounts of data.
This used to be irrelevant, but now with SATA, even PIO data xfer 
(normally what is used for non-READ/WRITE CDBs) must be 32-bit aligned 
because both SATA DMA and SATA PIO are converted into dword-based SATA 
FIS's on the wire.
