Ah, OK. So long as that goes upstream I'm happy... and it is good
to see that with that patch, the base context switching performance
_has_ actually gone up like I had hoped. Nice.

I think a lot of CPUs do. I think ia64 does not. It predicts
based on the contents of a branch target register which has to
be loaded I presume before instructoin fetch reaches the branch.
I don't know if this would hurt or not.

You might be right there.
