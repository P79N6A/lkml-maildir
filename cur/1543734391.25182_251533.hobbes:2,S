This would not work for several reasons.  How would you decide who is
allowed to run RT processes?  Root would have to set the above value,
which defeats the purpose of the realtime-lsm module which is to
selectively allow non-root users to run RT tasks.
Here is a good summary of the security issues that have been raised:

Realtime-lsm solves all of these problems.
