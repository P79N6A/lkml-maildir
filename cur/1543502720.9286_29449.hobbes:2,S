Its actually when mixing DMA cdroms and drives in the same system.
Apparently some (most?) cdroms do some strange sort of stop-n-go jerking
of the ide bus when run in DMA mode, which can confuse the VP3/MVP3 IDE
controller leading to hard system lockups.
The VIA chipsets seem to handle hard drives perfectly as hard drives do
not do this strange ide stuff.
