Well, I'm not aware of anything - just the patch "percpu data changes" I
sent to linux-arch the other day, which is related to this issue.
The whole early bootup what-the-arch-should-do-when protocol is rather a
mess, so I'm sure other things will need changing.

That sounds sane.  Perhaps make it a generic setup_arch_platform() whose
mandate is "do whatever needs to be done for setup_arch()".
