This is memory fragmentation, and all you can do is work around it until 
the e1000 driver is changed to split jumbo frames up on rx.  Here are a 
few ideas that should improve things for you:
	- switch to a 2GB/2GB split to recover the memory lost to highmem
	  (see Processor Type and Features / Memory split)
	- increase /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes -- more free memory will 
	  improve the odds that enough unfragmented memory is available for 
	  incoming network packets
I hope this helps.
