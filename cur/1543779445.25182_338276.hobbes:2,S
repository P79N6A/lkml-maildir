Ingo,
When did you solve the problem of ownership of locked semaphores? ;-)
Luca,
Unless Ingo did solve the problem of semaphores that can be locked by
one task and unlocked by another task, I wouldn't use your patch.
There's a problem with priority inheritance when it comes to these
semaphores.  That is who owns a locked semaphore that will later be
unlocked by someone else?  When a RT process blocks on this semaphore,
who does it boost to release it?  Ingo purposely put this in to crash
the compile so that we know where this can be a problem right away.
The patch you wanted to send was:
