My sound programs (audacity, non-RT) and mplayer disaggree with you. :-)
Not to mention some more mundane stuff like Gajim. (no stall with its
slow PyGTK UI on RSDL)
(Hint: I'm using Xfce, not KDE)
I'd recon KDE regresses because of kioslaves waiting on a pipe
(communication with the app they're doing IO for) and then expiring.
That's why splitting IO from an app isn't exactly smart. It should at
least be ran in an another thread.
A much better approach would be running IO in the context of the app,
but using a common shared library.
Also, Beryl works better with RSDL too.
(blur doesn't "disable" itself sometimes - which is the result of a lag)
