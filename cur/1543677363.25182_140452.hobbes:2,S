ok, so lets take this a step further.
can we have the TCP retransmit side take a performance hit if it needs to 
realign buffers?
once again, for a "high performance app" requiring gigabit-type speeds, its 
probably fair to say that this is mostly in the realm of applications on a 
LAN rather than across a WAN or internet.
on a switched LAN, i'd expect TCP retransmissions to be far fewer ...
cheers,
