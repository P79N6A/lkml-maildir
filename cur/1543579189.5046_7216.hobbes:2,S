Multiple bus types... Compaq server with PCI and EISA, for example? IIRC
the EISA bus is bridged onto one of the PCI busses. Perhaps a
breadth-first scan; PCI busses first, then bridged devices on PCI, then
internal non-PCI busses, then external busses.
Are there any systems where a non-PCI bus is not connected through a
PCI-foo bridge?
