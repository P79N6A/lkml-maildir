This is a question I was wondering about.  Why do the AMD chips
usually return a double MHZ value?  Are they really twice as
fast as an Intel chip when checking the loop you mentioned?

 ------------------ 
There are some timeouts in the kernel that need to be less than
any
available hardware timer ticks. So, upon startup the kernel measures
the time necessary to perform a simple loop. This calibrates
the loop
so it can be used for very short timing. The result of the calibration
is saved and displayed as 'BogoMips'. The larger the value, the
faster
your CPU can perform this simple timing loop. Therefore, it provides
a
relative indication of CPU speed.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
