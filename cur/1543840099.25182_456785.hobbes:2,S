I don't think it's a good idea to use get_random_int here. It's a secure
quite heavyweight random simulator that eats up precious entropy.
I would use something simple with an option for the user to specify the seed
(default jiffies maybe) for reproducibility.
e.g. the perfmon patchkit that was just posted had a reasonable simple
pseudo RND for lib/. Maybe you can reuse that.
