It should be complete -- but bear in mind that you may receive the mails
in a different order to the order in which they were sent, so just
applying them from a mail filter isn't necessarily sensible.
Also note that the dates on them are the date of the changeset itself,
not the date of application to Linus' tree (or indeed the date of the
cron job which creates the mail).

Almost -- it's run from an hourly cron job, which is more 'real time'
than Linus actually pushing from his own box to master.kernel.org and
quite enough of a demand on resources already.
It's not done with triggers on Linus' tree because I suspect that would
actually make Linus _wait_ while the mail is generated for every
changeset he's pushing to master.kernel.org. I do it with a cron job
which pulls from Linus' tree to another, and I don't do it with triggers
in my own tree because I suspect that would keep Linus' tree locked
while it generated the mails too. I do need to investigate possible
improvements to the way it's generated, though.
Suggestions welcome, preferably in 'diff -u' form.
