Hi, All
    I do some tests about suspend/resume on my two boxes. One is HP
laptop and the other is Asus EEEPC901. The suspend/resume can't work
well. Even after core is selected as the test mode, it still can't work
well.(echo core > /sys/power/pm_test)
    
    Then I do the same test by using the 2.6.28 kernel. And
suspend/resume can work well.
    
    
    Of course I will try to use the git-bisect to identify the first bad
commit ASAP.
 
Thanks.
   Yakui
