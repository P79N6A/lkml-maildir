I'd be very surprised if it were possible to have swap on a MMU-less 
machine (no virtual memory, page faults, etc.). Except for this nitpick, 
the patch looks fine, but my knowledge of MM is close to zero (and 
also of the new config language, but I'll have to learn it soon).

config SWAP
	depends on MMU
	bool "Support for paging of anonymous memory"
	default y
Comments?
