The freezer is crap... news at 11. Maybe a quick hack would be to let it
clear sigpending if tsk->mm == NULL but that's ugly. Note that there's
anything pretty about the freezer anyway...

Well.. why was it _and_wake() in the first place anyway ? Or do I miss
something ? Why would we need to wake a thread for which we are removing
signals ?
What about something like:
			do {
				rm_from_queue_full(&mask, &t->pending);
-				recalc_sigpending_and_wake(t);
				t = next_thread(t);
			} while (t != current);
+			recalc_sigpending();

Agreed.

That's been part of the discussion so far ... so yes, maybe. I also
think dequeue_signal_tsk would then only dequeue shared signals... But
then, that means signalfd would have to do a if (tsk == current) to
know which one to call...
So at the end of the day, easier to test it inside dequeue_signal().
