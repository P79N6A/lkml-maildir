Stefan, I did get a chance to try it out just now, and while I didn't try 
to capture a 2 hour movie, I did use kino to control the camera playback, 
rewind etc stuff for about 10 minutes and had no problems whatsoever.  
Kino I believe, can only step forward and backwards one frame at a time 
in its edit window as nothing happened when I tried those direct to the 
camera while it was paused.  I even went back and played spastic monkey 
on the controls, but was unable to trigger a segfault exit or any other 
kind of an error.  The only entry in the messages log for all this was:
Dec 17 12:47:13 coyote kernel: WARNING: The dv1394 driver is unsupported 
and will be removed from Linux soon. Use raw1394 instead.
Dec 17 12:47:13 coyote kernel: ieee1394: raw1394: /dev/raw1394 device 
initialized
So whatever was done to the ieee1394 stuffs between 2.6.19 and 2.6.20-rc1 
was a definite, and much appreciated improvement, many thanks to all 
concerned, I probably owe somebody a pint (or more).
