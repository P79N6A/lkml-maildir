Subject: RFC: remove bcopy()

There are very few places in the kernel which use bcopy() as of 2.5.40,
and every single one of them #defines it to memcpy() [some argue this
should be memmove().  i'm not terribly concerned].  There's also no
declaration of the bcopy() function in the kernel headers.  In light of
this, would anyone object to a patch removing the definitions of bcopy
from lib/string.c and arch/*/lib?
