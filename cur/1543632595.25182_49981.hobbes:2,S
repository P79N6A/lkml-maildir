It is still unfortunate that all contributions, especially larger scale
ones, cannot be openly accepted and embraced. It isn't as if the change
is overly invasive... if both system can operate in parallel, the impact
is significantly less.
Alas, we have these things called precidents and processes that attempt to
hone the quality of releases at the cost of potential productivity.
Keith: I do not think Linus is discouraging kbuild 2.5 due to popularity
or personalities. I suspect he is discouraging it due to a healthy fear
of the precident that it would set, as well as the chance that it would
require a great deal more work and you and your collaborators all get hit
by a bus ( or get a life? :-) ) tomorrow morning.
I'm not certain where the line is for 'breaking the change up', such that
the effort does not become substantially more, but the requirement for the
line has been decreed.
