2.4.10 was great success, the opposite of a disaster.

If this is an issue, than truncate() may be running into it already. So
if you're worried about the vm usage you should worrk about truncate
usage first.

objrmap itself should be self contained, the patch from Martin's tree is
quite small too.

I don't think they would work equally well. btw the vmstat I posted was
from a 16G machine btw, where the copy was stuck because of inability to
find 2G of clean cache.

I'm using various techniques so that it doesn't scan million pages in
one go, and obviously I must start swapping before the very last clean
cache is recycled. What I outlined is the concept. That is to
"prioritize on clean cache", "prioritize" doesn't mean "all and only
clean cache first".
but it's true I throw cpu at the work, but there's no other way without
more invasive changes, and the cpu load is not significant during
swapping anyways, so it's not urgent to improve the vm further in 2.4.
Just using an anchor to separate the clean scan from the dirty scan
would improve things, but that as well is low priority.

the last thing I would do is to take examples from freebsd or other

correct, this is why it's not a full scan, I provide a sysctl to tune
that and it's called vm_cache_scan_ratio as I wrote in the original
email. If it doesn't swap enough increasing the sysctl will swap more.

this was my point about the o1 vm, making the placement of the anchor is
very non obvious, the idea itself sounds fine.

So you here agree they're different things. Not sure if my idea is the
best for the long run either, but certainly it's needed in 2.4 to handle
such load and an equivalent solution (o1 vm is not enough IMO) will be
needed in 2.6 as well. The basic idea behind my patch may be the right
one for the long term though. However this is all low prio for 2.6 at
the moment and I didn't even list this part in the roadmap, because
first I need to avoid the rmap lockup before the machine start swapping
then I can think about this. (as far as I keep swapoff -a this is not an
issue)
