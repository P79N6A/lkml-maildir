Subject: Adding a new SCSI driver in 2.4.x

I'm trying to add a new scsi driver to the 2.4.x code stream. I've added the
driver into:
arch/i386/defconfig
drivers/scsi/Config.in
drivers/scsi/Makefile
In 2.2 you also had to add it under hosts.c, but that doesn't appear to be
the case any longer.
I ran:
make clean;
make mrproper;
then I ran make xconfig.
Selected the aacraid driver to be built as part of the resident kernel.
make bzImage;make modules
Installed the kernel and the modules that I just built. Blah Blah Blah.
Reboot the new kernel, but the aacraid driver detect function never gets
called. I must be missing added the pci ids for this card someplace. I just
don't know where I suppose to add the Scsi Host Template Structure.
