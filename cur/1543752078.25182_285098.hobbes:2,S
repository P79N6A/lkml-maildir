Please consider replacing with the following patch:
Description: Use ssleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee
the task delays as expected. The original code does use TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, but
does not check for signals or early return from schedule_timeout() so ssleep()
seems more appropriate.
