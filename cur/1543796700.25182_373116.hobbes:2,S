Yes, debugging suspend-to-RAM is hard, but it is not impossible. Try
with minimal config (noapic, 32-bit kernel, ...) then add
features. Hopefully minimum kernel will work...

Unfortunately cryptoapi only supports gzip compression, and that's
useless for swsusp. (Slows it down, 10 times). And adding LZW to
kernel just for swusp is wrong  thing to do.
