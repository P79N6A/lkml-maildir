No. Another CPU might increment value between LOCK INCL and
fetching v->counter. On ia32 architecture you are almost out of
luck. You can either try building atomic_inc around CMPXCHG,
using it as conditional store (but CMPXCHG is not available 
on i386), or you can just guard your atomic variable with 
spinlock - but in that case there is no reason for using atomic_t 
at all. 
                                            Best regards,

P.S.: Why you need to know that value? You can either rewrite
your code with atomic_dec_and_test/atomic_inc_and_test, or
you overlooked some race, or you have really strange problem.
