I think it should warn, but people have to be aware of the following:
- checkpatch errors are for stuff that really has to be fixed
- checkpatch warnings are for stuff that should be looked at
- the goal is not 0 checkpatch warnings but readable and bugfree code
A nice property of checkpatch is that it encourages to look closer at 
code like the following (it warns about the volatile):
		if (!netif_queue_stopped(netdev)) {
			netif_stop_queue(netdev);
			barrier();
			if ((((((volatile u16)nesnic->sq_tail)+(nesnic->sq_size*2))-nesnic->sq_head) & (nesnic->sq_size - 1)) != 1) {
				netif_start_queue(netdev);
				goto sq_no_longer_full;
			}
		}
