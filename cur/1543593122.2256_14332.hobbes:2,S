I upgraded from 2.4.5-ac2 to 2.4.5-ac5 recently, and all seemed well.
However, I noticed that the scrollwheel on my mouse wasn't working very
well.  I have that new Logitech cordless optical mouse, so my first
thought was that the batteries were low, but it was late at night, and I
didn't have spares, so I just dealt with it.  I got new batteries, and
the problem didn't go away.  Booted into windows, and the scrollwheel
worked fine.  I then remembered seeing the HID drivers in Alan's
changelog.  I booted back into -ac2, and the scrollwheel worked fine.
-ac5 and -ac6 both show this problem, and I assume every kernel since
the HID driver update has it as well.  Here's the contents of
/proc/bus/usb/devices:

Hope this is of some help
