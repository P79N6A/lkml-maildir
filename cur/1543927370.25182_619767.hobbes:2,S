Yes, that's true. Though at present we have the heartburn that anyone
wanting to write a script to pull out firmware revisions has to know
exactly where every driver stores this information.

Do you have a pointer to previous discussion about this? A central
device attribute does make more sense. It'd be nice to have uniform
access to details like the driver version as well.
