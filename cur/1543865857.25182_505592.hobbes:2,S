The i386 mm code only supports 4 entries in the PGD, so more than 36bit cannot 
be mapped right now.
Also even 64MB barely works (many boxes don't boot), you would likely
need at least the 4:4 patch to go >64GB. Also we know there are tons
of possible deadlocks in various subsystems when the lowmem:highmem ratio 
gets so out of hand.
Ok it could be probably all fixed with some work (at least the mm part,
the deadlocks would be more tricky), but would seem fairly 
pointless to me because all machines with >36bits support are 64bit capable.
