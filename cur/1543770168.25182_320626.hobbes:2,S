I think this is probably the bit of insight I was looking for; when it looks what what you need to do is wrong, you probably don't need to do that.
In fact, right now I am implementing a simple write() interface as a starting point.  Later on I will be wanting to used mmap()ed buffers anyway, and at that point the application (or some app-level library) will *absolutely* have to be able to parse frames out of the media file.
Thanks, all.
