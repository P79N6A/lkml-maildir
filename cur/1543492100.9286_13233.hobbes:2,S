Really ???

As it happens, I don't believe .rpm is inferior to .tar.gz at all, but
as that has no relevance to Alex's stupidity, I'll say no more on that
subject.

I presume there should be an "only" after "to be" in that sentence, in
which case I am in full agreement with it, both regarding debian and
redhat package formats, and regarding any other package formats that
may exist.
If you intended that "only" to be omitted, then I can't agree with you
as I see nothing wrong in the distribution of ANY software in either
.deb or .rpm provided that's not the only format it's distributed in.

As stated above, I can't agree with your exclusivity requirement...

I do, and have never stated otherwise.

Also irrelevant...

Vulgarity isn't required, and I've never claimed anything other than
the above anyway, so please don't claim otherwise...
There's nothing in your comments that refutes what I said, so I see no
reason to change my stance. I would presume you have misunderstood it
from your comments, so I will repeat it here:

I still believe that to be the case, so I stand by my claim. Indeed, I
will extend it, and additionally state the following:
 Q> In my honest opinion, it is pure stupidity to refuse to search
 Q> the Internet for a version of the software one is after that's
 Q> packaged in a form one can use.
OK, if there's no version thereof packaged in a form one can use, one
would then have reason to feel peeved, but such clearly wasn't the
case with what Alex was after, as would have been painfully obvious
from even a cursory glance at 
http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no
 for starters.
Best wishes from Riley.
