Yes, that second version worked for me.  But if __blk_queue_bounce()
is indeed the odd one out (likely but not certain), then the extension
below makes more sense - I don't like how your bio.c returns a cleared
bio_vec in some cases but not in others.  This is running fine for me
on my test machines, but my test coverage is probably very poor (am I
ever using more than the inlined bio_vec?), and I've not really tried
to understand all the ways through bvec_alloc_bs().
