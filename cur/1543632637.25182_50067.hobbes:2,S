Hi all...
Following with the cpu selection changes, setting the flags controlled
by the various CPU_X86_xxxx can be a real mess.
But, I have ralized that those CPU_X86 flags can be logically split in
two groups: features (TSC,MMX,3DNOW) and bugfixes (PPRO_FENCE) (or perhaps
more, it is just a first thought...).
So the algorithm can be easy (i think..)
- Enable all feature flags (say, MMX and 3DNOW)
- Disable all bugfix flags (FENCE)
- For each CPU
     if it does not have the feature, kill it
     (if VENDOR_INTEL set 3DNOW=n)
     if this-cpu-kernel could run on buggy-cpu, enable fix
     (if GENERIC_586 set FENCE=y)
Right ?
