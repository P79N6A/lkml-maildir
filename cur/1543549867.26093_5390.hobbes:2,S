I previously thought that elevator_linus() was called first, and then
elevator_linus_merge() was invoked to merge sequential requests before
they were sent to the driver. If that had been the case, your version of
elevator_linus() would have generated more seeks than CSCAN.
But as I said, I was mistaken, it doesn't work that way. The
elevator_linus() function is only called if merging isn't possible.
Therefore, no matter what algorithm you use in elevator_linus() the total
number of seeks should be the same.
Therefore, if you are not trying to be fair (as CSCAN is) maybe there is
an even better way to sort the requests. I think the important thing is
trying to minimize the total amount of seek time. But doing that requires
knowledge about how the seek time depends on the seek distance.
