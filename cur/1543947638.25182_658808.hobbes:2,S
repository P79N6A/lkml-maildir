Could we please be very careful to not conflate oprofile's kernel support
with oprofile userspace?  For the purposes of this discussion the
distinction is most important.
I _assume_ you're referring to oprofile userspace which I agree is
user-hostile.  It is a rich area for others to improve upon.  In so doing
they might even have a need to change oprofile's kernel code.  But simply
giving up and going off and implementing some parallel kernel code is an
utter last resort and should only be done after it has been shown that the
current kernel code is unfixable.
