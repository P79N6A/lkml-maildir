Talking around this issue, is there any chance of getting the
official use of the first parameter to ioremap documented in
Documentation/IO-mapping.txt please?  There appears to be
confusion as to whether it is:
a) PCI bus address
b) CPU untranslated address
Currently, IO-mapping.txt seems to imply (a), but I believe that
a lot of people on lkml will disagree with that.
