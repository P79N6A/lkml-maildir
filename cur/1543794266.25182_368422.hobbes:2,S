Subject: [PATCH] mpcore_wdt.c bogus fpos check

Hi,
drivers/char/watchdog/mpcore_wdt.c write function contains a check for
(ppos != &file->f_pos). Such check used to make sense when a pointer to
file->f_pos was handed by vfs_write(), not a copy of it as it stands
now.
Has been broken since then... Don't have a device to test - does it work
at all?
mpc8xx_wdt.c is similarly broken (patch will be sent separately).
