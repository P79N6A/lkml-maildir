hopefully it's useful for you, I'd love to see performance results one
way or the other.

damn, i thought i fixed that.

yeah, that can be worse on some systems than others, it seems to vary
a bit with file system and device driver.  some setups cause more
"breaks" in the stream of requests.

hmmm, haven't tested this recently.  dunno why that would have broken...

oh, yeah, definitely, this algorithm is only suitable for a workload
where you want latency over fairness.  suppose i should mention that.
Thanks for your comments and testing
