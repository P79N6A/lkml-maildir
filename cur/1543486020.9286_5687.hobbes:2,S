Subject: [2.2.2-pre4 + SCT's buffer patch] OK, but 1 major swap frenzy

	I've been running 2.2.2-pre4 with SCT's fix to the buffer refiling
since this morning. (UP PPro, IDE)  It has worked great.  However, I
just had a major swap frenzy while running basically nothing but
netscape:
telomere:~> free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:         63552      27668      35884       9780        824     
15644
-/+ buffers/cache:      11200      52352
Swap:       128484      27672     100812
X locked up for several seconds.
Anyone have any idea what might have caused this?
