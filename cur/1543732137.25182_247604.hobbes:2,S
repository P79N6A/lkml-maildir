No. I waste just one page, the end page of mem_map.
When the end of mem_map is not aligned, there are 2 cases.
case 1) length of mem_map is even number.
 -------------------------------
 |  |  |  |  |C |  |B |  |A | X|  no-page-area    order=0
 -------------------------------
 |     |     |C    |B    |                        order=1
 -------------------------
 |           |C          |                        order=2
 -------------------------
X is reserved and will not join to buddy system.
By doing this,
page "A" has no boddy in order=0, "X" is reserved.
page "B" has no buddy in order=1, "A" is order 0.
page "C" has no buddy in order=2, "A" is order 0.
..........
case 2) length of mem_map is odd number.
-----------------------------
 |  |  |  |  |C |  |B |  |X |    no-page-area    order=0
 ----------------------------
 |     |     |C    |B    |                       order=1
 -------------------------
 |           |C          |                       order=2
 -------------------------
page "B" has no buddy in order=1, X is reserved.
.........
Access to no-page-area in buddy system does not occur.
