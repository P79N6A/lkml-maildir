Subject: [patch 2/4 MKII] cpufreq_conservative: alter default responsiveness

The sensible approach to making conservative less responsive than ondemand :) 
As mentioned in patch [1/4].  We do not want conservative to shoot through 
all the frequencies, its point (by default) is to slowly move through them.
By default its ten times less responsive.
