Hi Al,
  I'm now running 2.5.0 with fix you posted - and now during dselect
run I received:
Unpacking replacement manpages ...
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory
  #3801539: unaligned directory entry - offset=0, inode=1801675088,
  rec_len=26465, name_len=101
Remounting filesystem read-only
rm: cannot remove directory `/var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci': Read-only file system
...
and system is obviously unusable. I'll probably reboot and run fsck again.
If someone can show me how I can dump contents of some inode by number
(and not by name) in debugfs, I can look into inode itself... I found
only 'ncheck', to convert number to name, and this is running and running...
System was running 2.5.0 without patch for some time, but I followed
your guidelines for rebooting:
fuser -k /
sync
mount -o remount,ro /
sync
reboot
After reboot fsck was NOT run, so it is possible that there
might be some corruption - but I ran fsck on my non-root partition
after boot, and it did not show any problems.
                                        Thanks,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
