Mark, you have a valid point but if they see this level of noise the
auto-dma-downgrade feature set exclusive to Linux will ramp down the max.
performance from init to a reasonable threshold.  The object is to
stablize the transfer rates first and then maintain performance.
You know the song and dance my friend, if anyone does.  Very few could
keep me in check, but you have managed quite well and I am impressed!
