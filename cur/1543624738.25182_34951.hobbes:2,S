Hi Marcelo et all,
 The following fixes some rather straightforward bugs in the old
(pre-O(1)) scheduler that I discovered while exercising it with
custom instrumentation written in.  These may be worth fixing, given
that it may be a long time before the new O(1) scheduler officially
shows up in a production tree.

- ksoftirqd() - change daemon nice(2) value from 19 to -19.
    SoftIRQ servicing was less important than the most lowly of batch
    tasks.  This patch makes it more important than all but the realtime
    tasks.
- reschedule_idle() - smp_send_reschedule when setting idle's need_resched
    Idle tasks nowdays don't spin waiting for need->resched to change,
    they sleep on a halt insn instead.  Therefore any setting of
    need->resched on an idle task running on a remote CPU should be
    accompanied by a cross-processor interrupt.
