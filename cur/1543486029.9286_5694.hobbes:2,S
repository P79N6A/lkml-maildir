	Hi. New version of rename patch (this time against -pre4) is out -
I've posted it to fsdevel and had put it on  
	
ftp://math.psu.edu/pub/viro/rename-patch-7
(thing had grown too large for l-k - ~56K, mostly *removing* dead code ;-)
News:
	*	In case we are doing a cross-directory rename and the source
		is a directory we have to change .. in it. Thus we need write
		permissions. Check added. Kudos to James Griffiths.
	*	If source and target are links to the same inode no permissions
		matter - rename() should do nothing and return 0. Fixed.
	*	In ext2, ufs, smbfs, coda and nfs lots of excessive name length
		checks trimmed. It's enough to do it once in ->lookup() and
		return -ENAMETOOLONG if name is bad. Then no other method will
		receive such dentry.
	*	Related to previous: mknod() on ext2 and ufs would return
		-ENAMETOOLONG in some cases when -EIO should be returned.
		Fixed as the side effect of trimmage above.
	*	Dead code removed from {ext2,ufs}_link() - check for
		target being IMMUTABLE/APPEND-ONLY is already done in VFS,
		so there is no need in duplication.
	*	Bug introduced by msdos rename() cleanup fixed - 
		rename("foo",".foo") might blow up. Badly.
Please, try it out.
						Cheers,
							Al
