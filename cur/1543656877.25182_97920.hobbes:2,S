I'd like us to disable interrupts too.  On powermacs, the interrupt
controller is typically inside a combo I/O ASIC which is on the PCI
bus.  If we take an interrupt while the ASIC's BAR is relocated or
turned off, we will get a machine check when we try to access the
interrupt controller and the kernel will die at that point.
