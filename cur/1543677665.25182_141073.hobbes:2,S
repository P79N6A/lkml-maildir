The code for aio_read/write does distinguish between these cases.
- if you spot a case where it doesn't do let me know.
aio_setup_iocb() just sets up the method after performing the 
specified checks. Its aio_run_iocb() which actually executes it.

Actually, looking closer, I think its just aio poll that's 
incorrectly merged here. The right way to implement aio poll in
the new model would have been to setup a retry method for it
in aio_setup_iocb(), not run generic_aio_poll() directly there.
