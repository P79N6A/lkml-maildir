Does it?
Most of the uses are either
 - truly tiny bits of code
 - code that is used only once which, as you as, will not currently 
   be auto-inlined on i386, so we do it by hand.
An exception is some of the xdr code.
If I 
  #define inline
in nfs3xdr.c, the nfsd.o changes from 
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  76132    3464    2408   82004   14054 ../mm-i386/fs/nfsd/nfsd.o
to
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  72452    3464    2408   78324   131f4 ../mm-i386/fs/nfsd/nfsd.o
which is probably a win.
Is that what you were referring to?

It's hard to *know* if it is a problem, but I am conscious that nfsd
adds measurably to stack depth for filesystem paths, and probably
isn't measured nearly as often.
It's true that 50 bytes out of 4K isn't a lot, but wastage that can be
avoided, should be avoided.
