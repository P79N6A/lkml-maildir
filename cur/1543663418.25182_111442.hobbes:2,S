Did some space consumption comparisons on make -j 256:
before:
	24116 pte_chain objects in slab cache
after:
	716 pte_chain objects in slab cache
The vast majority of anonymous pages (for which we're using the non
object based method) are singletons, and hence use pte_direct ...
hence the massive space reduction.
