Pure trial and error in the first time. When realising that something is
wrong with the assigned interrupts (looking at the kernel output) we
tried to set the ones that were working in a 2.4 kernel. When the
machine finally booted a "lspci" showed that the slot number changed.

Is it that onboard network tulip kind of thingy? Do you have some other
PCI cards installed?
I used to have an extra symbios logic scsi-host-adapter installed.
On high network load and loading/writing to a HD (using onboard scsi), I
noticed a lot of problems: either the scsi-host-adapter lost the
interrupt or the network driver lost some packets or both. After having
removed the extra scsi-host-adapter it works fine now.
