Dear all,
I've realized using the great powertop ( 
http://www.linuxpowertop.org/
 )
that loading the appletouch driver (and touching it once) makes consumes
about 0.3 W even when not touching the pad. As rmmod'ing appletouch
fixes this I wonder why the driver does not do this alone. So my
question is what does one have to do to convert a driver (such as
appletouch) to make use of usb autosuspend except for
 .supports_autosuspend = 1
...
While we are at it usb related powerhogs on this macbook pro are
uhci_hcd (usb keyboard) and usb_hcd_poll_rh_status (rh_timer_func)
too...
Soeren.
