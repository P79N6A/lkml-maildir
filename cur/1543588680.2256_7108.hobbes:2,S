AFAIK the card could be used for all sorts, but I'm not terribly
knowledgable about it as I've only been told how to program the thing with
respect to it's chosen application, ie. to drive the platform. It's got
analog and digital inputs/outputs, I don't know what else.
I'm writing this driver as part of my final year project at University,
and I'm working from the existing Windows code, so I'm not really exposed
to the cards internals at all.
The card is solely accessed through four consecutive I/O port address,
the first two control the address of ram on the card I want, and I read or
write to the second two. All accesses are 16-bit wide. That's as much as I
know really.

My other problem is that I only have three/four weeks left to do as much
as possible, I've just managed to get my head 'round the Windows code so I
know how the code works, without having to fit it into some other grand
scheme of things.
I did try to write the driver with respect to making it nice and modular,
but without another card I can't work out what might be common to both
etc.
Once I've written the driver, I might be able to help merge it into some
other system, but atm my prority is to get it working as it is, so I can
at least get a good mark, I don't think I'm doing it a bad way, it's just
based heavily in structure on the existing Windows code.
Cheers
Matt
