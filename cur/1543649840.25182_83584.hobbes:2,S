Thats primarily about resource handling orders. Making sure we don't
release the claimed pci resources in the driver until the driver itself
is sure it has shut up.
I'm doing suprise removal ok with the thinkpad 600 (in 2.4 with some
limits due to the 2.4 pci layer). Network stuff seems to be fine. The
block layer has major issues.
