To get <1ms latencies I suspect you will also need the preemtive kernel
and lock-break patches (
http://www.tech9.net/rml/linux/
) and if you're
running on an x86, changing the HZ value in linux/asm/param.h from 100
to 1000 will also be a good idea IMHO. 
Of course, this requires re-compiling and replacing the kernel which may
or may not be apropriate. AFAIK both the patches and the HZ value change
are already in the 2.5.x development kernels already, but not everyone
are running *that* version quite yet... :-D
