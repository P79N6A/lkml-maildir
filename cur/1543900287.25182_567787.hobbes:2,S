Well, I am not a maintainer, but I personally think this patch is too complex.
Mathieu, please use "diff -p", it is very difficult to read it. I am not sure
I understand this patch correctly, I don't have a -git tree.

This is a strange change. Why we return success when migration failed ?
OK, I guess this is a special hack for the modified migration_thread()...

This means that move_task_off_dead_cpu() will spin until the task will be scheduled
on the dead CPU. Given that we hold tasklist_lock and irqs are disabled, this may
never happen.
(This patch adds a lot of #ifdef's, I think it could be simplified if you add
 get_migrate_count() which is defined as 0 when !CONFIG_PREEMPT).

I guess this is migration_thread(). The wake_up_process(req->task) looks strange,
why? It can't help if the task waits for the event/mutex.
And this is racy. What if check_migrate() is in progress, and the task has already
checked TIF_NEED_MIGRATE?
Hm. We re-add "req" to rq->migration_queue. This means that migration_thread() will
do a busy-wait loop. Not good and deadlockable, migration/X is SCHED_FIFO.
And what if __migrate_task() failed because ->cpus_allowed was changed in between?
Oleg.
