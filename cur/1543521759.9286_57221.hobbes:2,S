I assume you mean both request_module() and request_modulef() should be
real functions (very small if CONFIG_KMOD is not defined). Otherwise
anything that uses request_modulef() and therefore includes kmod.h will
still depend on CONFIG_KMOD and the main advantage of this work will be
lost.
The patch I sent did not "do just that" but will "do just that" in the
next revision.
