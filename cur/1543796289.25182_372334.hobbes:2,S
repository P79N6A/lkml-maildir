Thanks, yes.  I'll leave out updating the verstr[],
I think that should be sent by you alone.

Okay, if you insist.  Yes, all those returns pass that way, but if it
actually did some reading into the memory, it called read_tape, which
did the effective release_buffering immediately after st_do_scsi.
But perhaps I'm misreading it, and even if not, someone will come
along and "correct" it later, or change things around and make my
not-dirty assumption wrong.
It's just that after seeing how sg.c is claiming to dirty even readonly
memory, I'm excessively averse to saying we've dirtied memory we haven't.
My hangup, I'll get over it!

Possibly because of issues with hugetlb compound pages: David Gibson
raised that issue recently with respect to access_process_vm
(page[1].mapping is reused and crashes set_page_dirty), I'm thinking
we don't want to add PageCompound tests all over, and have mailed
Andrew separately for guidance on that.
