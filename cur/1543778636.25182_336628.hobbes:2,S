The answers you already got are:
- for that much memory, 64bit processors are really recommended
- 2.6 kernels are a better choice for this scenario
- linux-kernel doesn't support vendor kernels, does the same problem 
  occur with kernel 2.6.12 ?
Another thing that surprises me is that why you are testing an old 
version of RHEL.
If you want to build a new system, you should better test RHEL 4.
