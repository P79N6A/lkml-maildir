The point of specific-width integers is to preserve a specific
binary format, such as a filesystem on-disk data structure, or a
kernel-userspace ABI, etc.  If you just need a number, use a
different type.

Well, _strictly_speaking_, it's "implementation defined", where the
"implementation" includes the kernel (due to the syscall interface).

But the C library is implicitly dependent on the kernel headers for
a wide variety of datatypes.

Some of which are produced by kernel sources: /usr/include/linux,
/usr/include/asm, etc.

Well, Linus has supported that there is no standard, except where
ABI is concerned, there we must use __u32 so that it does not clash
with libc or user programs.

It's "implementation" (kernel+libc+gcc) defined.  It just means that
gcc, the kernel, and libc have to be much more careful not to tread
on each others toes.

The "standard libraries" includes the syscall interface here.  If
the kernel types could not be prefixed with __, then what _should_
we prefix them with?

That doesn't work for an ABI.  If you switch compilers (or from 32-bit
to 64-bit like from x86 to x86-64, you _must_ be able to specify
certain widths for all the ABI numbers to preserve compatibility.
