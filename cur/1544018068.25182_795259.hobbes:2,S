I'm not sure how something can livelock in atomic_dec_and_lock which
doesn't take a spinlock itself? Are you saying you run into NUMA memory
unfairness here? Or did I misparse you?

I was wondering what this does to the latencies when dput/iput
is only done for very objects. Does it increase costs then
significantly?
As a high level comment it seems like a lot of work to work
around global locks, like the inode_lock, where it might be better to 
just split the lock up? Mind you I don't have a clear proposal
how to do that, but surely it's doable somehow.
