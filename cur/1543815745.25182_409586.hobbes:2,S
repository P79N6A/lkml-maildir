You probably mean _dynamic_ initialization of a notifier head.  The 
current code handles static initialization just fine.
There's nothing wrong with doing things like this.  I didn't include 
initialization macros originally simply because there aren't any 
dynamically-initialized notifier heads in the kernel.
