thqats what i was lead to believe - for all practical purposes if you
have a api library that goes and for short bursts creates and destroys
threads to try and speedup a chrunching-heavy inner loop by spliting it
into segments and having different threads handle each segment - then
it wont get scheduled across multiple processors - if this is he case
si there a way to force it (so i can at lats get benchmarks as i can
pretty much be sure it ont give any speedup on a UP box)
