I'm waiting for more people to send me problem reports.  Currently, it
looks like PCI1410 and OZ6912 cardbus controllers, and one VG469 ISA
PCMCIA controller are affected.
If there's anyone who has found this problem and hasn't reported it, it
would be most useful if they could put together a report (containing the
requested information.) so we get more datapoints.
Someone else mentioned that the problem occurred (iirc) sometime between
2.5.70 and 2.5.75, which is when the bulk of the major pcmcia changes
went in... so it isn't that useful.
Also note that I'm unable to reproduce the problem on either my ARM
system containing a CL6833 Cardbus controller nor my IBM Thinkpad
with a TI PCI1250, so I'm completely dependent on getting reports from
the community to solve this issue.
