That is a nice guide, but is oriented to developers, I think jes
was asking from a user POV (I've needed to google for such things
several times) ie how to switch to a given tag and return to master,
how to update the repository periodically, etc; no stuff about how to
manage patches. It may be nice to see such thing on your guide, something
like this:
- How to get a copy of linus'tree
  git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
- Update your copy:
  cd linux-2.6; git pull; git pull --tags
- How to go back to a certain snapshot
  git reset --hard v2.6.13 (ls .git/refs/tags to see all the tags). Not the
  cleanest method, I think. "git-checkout -f master" will return to the "head"
  of the repository. You can also pass commit-IDs to git-reset instead of tags?
- bisect search
  git reset --hard BrokenVersion
  git bisect start
  git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2
  Compile, test, and do "git bisect good" or "git bisect bad" until you find
  the culprit. If it doesn't compile or something you can do a "git bisect good/bad"
  "git bisect reset" resets the repository when you are done.

  explains it with more detail.
