Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: Remove LANG preset in top-level Makefile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus, please apply before 2.6.8 final!
In the top-level Makefile a number of locale related
environment variables were preset to give a small
speed up when building the kernel.
Unfortunately this had the bad sideeffect that the
variable CFLAGS_vmlinux.lds.o lost the exported vaule in
some setups (obviously not mine).
This smells like a make issue - but the best solution is simply
to drop presetting the locale related variables.
