of course I can ... I can even start X as root if I set it up correct,
but thats not the point. The point of having a user, is _not_ to have to
start programs as root. I don't want that.

If its a security thing, and the client program hasn't adepted, okay,
but this ...

well I use k3b so it uses groisofs to burn dvds ... I don't care much
about cdrecord and in my deep inner world I hope they get replaced, by
someone with whom you can argue.
