What makes you say that?  The list of GPL compatible license strings is
in include/linux/module.h, modutils uses *exactly* the same set of
strings.  If somebody uses a different string, their license is not
GPL.

To triage bug reports.  Any bug report against a tainted kernel is
almost certain to be bounced with "your kernel contains code that we do
not have the source for, send this bug report to the company that
maintains the non-GPL code".

No, they are in the modinfo section along with module parms, author,
description, kernel vesrion etc.  None of that gets loaded into memory.
