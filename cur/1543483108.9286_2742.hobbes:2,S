This may be a bug report - I don't know yet.
I've got 11 ethernet devices in a system.
I modified linux/drivers/net/Space.c and added the eth's above 8 
They all come up on module detection.
I addressed an eth8 and added the route for the network it was on.
However when I try to traceroute from outside the of the network to the
machine It timesout.
When I put the address on a device below eth8 (eth0-7) I get no problem on
the traceroute.
my kernel version is 2.0.36
net-tools 1.45 (should I go to 1.50?)
thanks
