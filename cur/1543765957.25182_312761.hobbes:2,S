Subject: test of 'good_bytes' in scsi_io_completion is always true (in drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c)

in drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c::scsi_io_completion() 'good_bytes' is tested 
for being >= 0, but 'good_bytes' is an unsigned int, so that test is 
always true. My *guess* is that what was intended was to test if 
good_bytes is > 0, but I don't know this code well enough to be sure. 
The patch below makes the change to test if it's > 0, but if the code in 
the 'if' really wants to run if it's >= 0, then we might as well just 
remove the 'if'.
In any case, the current code looks fishy.
