The current work in progress to support
capability set on files will address this
longstanding issue.

Not a bad idea, but the notion of underprivileged
processes has been tried before. The capability
mechanism is explicitly designed to provide for
the seperation and management of privilege and
taking it in the "other" direction requires
a rethinking of the inheritance mechanism.
I understand that today's scheme that does not
do inheritance has problems, but that should
soon be resolved.

A fine page, BTW. Thank you.

The crippling is not deliberate. It is
unfortunate and represents a number of complex
issues that are being resolved. Finally.

Again, the capability scheme is intended to
address the omnipotent userid problem. It pulls
the userid and privilege apart. It also provides
a more granular privilege. But it does not change
what operations require privilege. That is left
to wiser minds.

The fundimental flaw in your reasoning is
the assumption that linux will never have
capability inheritence.

You did say so!
