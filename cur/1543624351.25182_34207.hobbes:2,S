Happened to me *more than once*. Every single time: Drive has what
looks like "Surface Errors" to the OS, SMART thinks the drive is
dandy, DFT thinks the drive is dandy and after using the DFT "erase"
feature it would even work (on the whole surface) again. Question only
remains for how long. My dealer usually gives me a replacement disk
when I tell him "this one's bogus" even if it doesn't show any
immediate errors in DFT and similar tests, but I'm sure not everyone's
that lucky.
I don't usually bash manufacturers, but with recent (> 10GB) IBM
ATA-33+ drives I've experienced this behaviour in well above 50% of
all units I've seen. The MTBF on their SCA LVD ones doesn't make me
squirm with delight either, but those a) don't lie about being broken
and b) tend to be easier to replace.
So long,
   Joe
