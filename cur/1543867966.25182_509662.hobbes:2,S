The text suggests it doesn't allow SPU_FS=y with OPROFILE=m, which I think
should be allowed. I also don't see any place in the code where you actually
use CONFIG_OPROFILE_CELL.
Ideally, you should be able to have an oprofile_spu module that can be
loaded after spufs.ko and oprofile.ko. In that case you only need
config OPROFILE_SPU
	depends on OPROFILE && SPU_FS
	default y
and it will automatically build oprofile_spu as a module if one of the two
is a module and won't build it if one of them is disabled.
