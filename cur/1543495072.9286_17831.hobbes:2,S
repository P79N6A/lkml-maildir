I can reproduce this everytime now (even after switching virtual consoles).
Press Alt, SysRq, Space, and then release Space, Alt, SysRq.  It beeps on
most keystrokes after that until I press Ctrl-Shift-Alt and release.
I have a couple other things competing for my time but I'm looking at the
source as I get spare moments to see if I can figure out where it's getting
off the train at the wrong station.
