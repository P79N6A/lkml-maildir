yep, sched_yield() is broken for RT tasks. (this is true for 2.3 too;
i have a patch that makes it work, but there's still one more issue
i'll have to look at (code messing directly with scheduler internals;
eg there are places in kernel that assume 'policy |= SCHED_YIELD;' will
cause SCHED_OTHER tasks to run even when current->policy==SCHED_(FF|RR)).
