   The correct fix is to provide a userland-only version of cdrom.h which
   doesn't use the private kernel types.h. Or a file containing _only_
   those parts which can be shared between kernel and userland, defined
   using standard types such as uint32_t etc. 
Correct in your world only :-)
Listen, what do you think is the latency every time I add something
to rtnetlink.h or pfkeyv2.h?  Should I just sit and twiddle my thumbs
waiting for everyone to update their glibc or kernel-headers or
whatever package before they can compile networking apps using the
new feature?
The fact is, until that issue is solved, we have to assume that
programs are going to include kernel headers and there is nothing
we can do about it until we provide a better situation than exists
now.
Therefore, making inclusions of these kinds of headers work from
userspace is in some sense a requirement.
