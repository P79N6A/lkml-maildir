I definitely agree with this change.
We have several cases where device names are user configurable,
yet the devices live in a directory which also has subdirectories
created by other subsystems.
It's pointless to require the top-level guy to look for any
purge out any subdirectory cases, that's none of it's business.
I realize the backtrace is useful for finding bugs, but in this
case it's definitely not appropriate.
