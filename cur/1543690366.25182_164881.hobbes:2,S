Even with zerocopy, you have to build the message somehow.  If process A 
builds a message and passes it to process B, then then isn't that as 
efficient as you can get with message passing?  How does MPI do any better?
However, if both processes directly map the same memory and use it 
directly (without "messages" as such), then I would see *that* as zerocopy.
