Hello
I've noticed that my system (T61) doesn't want to suspend when SD card
is in the card reader slot with 2.6.25-rc2  (no problem when the card
is outside)
Also the card is not even mounted, it's just in the slot and suspend locks.
2.6.24 worked correctly.
Bisection games showed this patch as the source of problem:
775b64d2b6ca37697de925f70799c710aab5849a is first bad commit
Hope this helps
