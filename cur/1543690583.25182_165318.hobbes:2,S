That's basically impossible, I don't want to shoe horn atapi numbering
into faked bus,id,lun type things.
So people will just have to get used to the change. And I bet that Joe
user with his cd-r thinks it's a lot more intuitive to use dev=/dev/hdc
(which is his burner) rather than dev=1,0,0 for instance. The scanning
basically helps that case alone, because noone can guess these numbers.
