Good grief!  Versioning is just a file-naming convention!

You just modify your user-mode tools and your 'C' runtime library
to make whatever atrocious versioning mechanism you want. You can
even make all filenames upper case, just like VAX/VMS, and you can
even make your shell DCL if you want. It's where the rules are
enforced like (mapping everything to upper-case).
I can see it now, upon startup `init` execs:
   SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT.EXE -
   INPUT=SYS$SYSTEM:[etc]inittab -
   OUTPUT=SYS$SYSTEM:[var.log]startup.log -
   ERROR=SYS$SYSTEM:[dev]console -
   UIC=[0,0] -
   PRIV=(NOALL, TMPMBX, NETMBX, SETPRV)

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
