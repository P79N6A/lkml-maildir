These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity. 
It is configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.
Apply to 2.6.14
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.14/2.6.14-ck2/patch-2.6.14-ck2.bz2
or server version

*note name change for server version

Split patches available.
Changes:
 The server patch has had its name changed to cks* to support patching with 
ketchup which Matt Mackall has kindly enabled for -ck.
Added:
+sched-staircase12.1_12.2.patch
 A small buglet fix for the staircase cpu scheduler (mostly harmless)
+mm-kswapd_inherit_prio.patch
+mm-prio_dependant_scan.patch
+mm-batch_prio.patch
 These are patches designed to change the way the virtual memory subsystem 
behaves according to the 'nice' level of the task that called it. This has 
some weak influence on how much cpu ram allocation takes, and how quickly it 
will try to allocate that ram, thus providing some support for 'nice' within 
the vm. In the presence of an obscene memory load that was niced this showed 
some improvement in the time taken to compile a minimal kernel config (2:10 
vs 2:55).
Modified:
-adaptive-readahead-4.patch
+adaptive-readahead-6.patch
 Updated to the latest adaptive readahead code (thanks Wu Fengguang) which 
enables the thrash protection by default and has numerous other enhancements. 
Please cc him if you have any feedback about it.
