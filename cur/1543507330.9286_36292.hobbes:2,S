We solved a similar problem by limiting the buffering per device/partition to
a subset of the buffer cache (75%, tunable), rather than hacking in raw
devices. 
This worked extremely well for our application, a parallel file system.
The system had following features:
   Multiple disk partitions. (Note 1)
   Bulk I/O tended to be on just one partition at a time.
   Most other processes were active in partitions without bulk I/O.
Note 1: This approach has no benefit on single-partition installations.
However most bulk I/O users do have multiple partitions, and typically have
multiple disks.
