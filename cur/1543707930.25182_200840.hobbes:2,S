Isn't this rather bad, it's only possible to have one process that
does this magic clean bit thing.  Other applications such as Wine or a
DOS emulator might want to get the same speedups.  
Instead of a bit, why don't just use the generation number idea that
have been tossed around?  Let each directory have a generation number
which can be read with a function:
    long sys_get_generation(dirfd);
Then the name lookup would work with multiple processes and with some
code like this:
repeat:
        new_generation = sys_get_generation(dirfd);
        if (new_generation == old_generation) {
		... pure user-space fast path, use Samba dcache ...
		return;
	}
        old_generation = generation;
	... fill Samba dcache ...
	readdir() loop
	goto repeat;
Add a new create syscall with the same idea as your one bit syscall,
which checks that the generation number matches.  If the generation
number doesn't match the create call fails.
    int create_synchronized(name, mode, generation);
