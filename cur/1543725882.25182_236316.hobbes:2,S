G'Day.
Some months ago i've reported about bug which Andrea defined as
"race in expand_stack with threads" (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/14/52
),
but it was related to -aa branch (More precisely 2.6.5-aa5).
After applied patch from Andrea (many tnx), i did not notice
any troubles with 2.6.5-aa5 and later with 2.6.7 until today
when i've caught very similar bug(?) on the same system. 
[Dual P4 Xeon 2.4GHz, 2G ECC RAM - (production web-server)
Gentoo, kernel 2.6.7]
System behaviour and trace are nearly the same, system alive but
i couldn't do ps, pkill etc. Here is a trace:
