I believe the audio people have established that some delays _can't_
be covered up by buffering (such as time between key press and the
addition of a track to a mix).  If low-latency Linux has peaks, they
will just have to be "seldom enough" for the application.
Proving the delays are "seldom enough" will be even more difficult
than optimizing an OS for both real-time response and general
multitasking performance.
