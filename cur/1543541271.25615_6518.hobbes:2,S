Why not make the types opaque in the same way as ptes:
typedef struct { unsigned long addr; } ioaddr_t;
#define readl(ioaddr) __readl(ioaddr.addr)
void *ioremap(ioaddr) {
    unsigned long addr = ioaddr.addr;
    ...
}
inline iooffset(ioaddr_t ioaddr, long delta) {
    ioaddr.addr += delta;
    return ioaddr;
}
Assuming gcc can generate the same code and doesn't get confused
by any of the struct passing and manipulation.
