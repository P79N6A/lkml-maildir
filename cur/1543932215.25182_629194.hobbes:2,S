huh? By default we still use port 0x80. Any udelay is non-default and 
needs the user to explicitly switch to it. But it enables us to debug 
any suspected drivers by asking testers to: "please try this driver with 
io_delay=udelay, does it still work fine?". So those extra options are 
quite sensible. If you have any real technical arguments against that 
then please let us know.
