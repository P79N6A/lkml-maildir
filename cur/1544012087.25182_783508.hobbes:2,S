It seems to me that the safest solution would be to mark USB storage 
devices as unsafe for last-sector partition table probing, like some 
kind of CAPACITY_DUBIOUS flag, causing it to be skipped on these 
devices, at least by default. After all, it would seem quite unusual to 
see anything other than a DOS-style partition table on a USB storage 
device (or else no partition table at all).
