a) without the web of trust, it's not much stronger than the original
method
b) it's a second method so signing off is no longer a uniform process
c) it requires tools and a database
d) it adds significant amounts of cruft to patches
e) said cruft is fragile and won't survive minor edits along the way
That last point is key - we can't propagate a GPG signature upstream
_with revisions_. Trivial revisions of the form 'rediff against latest
kernel' are to be assumed.
