Hmm... let me assume that you are using UDMA on all those drives.
Since you have apparently a system with quite a lot of
different simultanecousy active drives in them it could be very well possible
that the code that determined the do_request drive selection strategy
was the cause of your problems. It could very well be that
the recent changes with respect to this actually could have cured
this. (2.5.8 is the time around where die PADAM_ tags got introduced
there.
