Right. 
How would you like that the filesystem would occasionally return data
that was in a file a few days ago? I mean it was there at some moment
in time, why are you getting upset about reading that data now?
The programming interface gives us guarantees. If you perform a read
on a file, you get the most recent data. If you ask for a timeout of
10ms, you get to wait at least 10 ms.
A friend of mine has a CD-changer. Two CD players, and a robot arm to
fetch any of the 300 CDs that the rack will hold. The stepper motors
can step at 300Hz. So on an alpha, you'd simply 
	usleep (3000);
before instructing the motor to do the next step. It is perfectly
accpetable that this usually takes 4ms. You loose about 25% of the
speed of the robot, because it usually takes 4ms, but you have about 3
minutes to go get the next CD anyway. However the motor will loose a
step every time you step it in 2ms. Loosing steps means damaging CDs.
(Stepper motors come with the guarantee that they are exactly in the
position that you programmed them to be, provided that you stick to
the rules.... so no: it is not practical to have sensors all over the
place to detect the exact position of cd-grab-tool. That's why the
stepper motors were used.)

Yes. Sorry. But being right carries more weight than convenience....

That won't work. You'd have to do the cycle-counter gettimeofday call
every time to get that. Now we just rely on "jiffies".
