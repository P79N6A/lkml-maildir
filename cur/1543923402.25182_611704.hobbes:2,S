Right in one!  One of the big changes in -rt is that spinlock critical
sections (and RCU read-side critical sections, for that matter) are
preemptible under CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT.
And I agree that this patchset will have missed quite a few places where
additional changes are required.  Hence the word "including" above, rather
than something like "specifically".  ;-)
