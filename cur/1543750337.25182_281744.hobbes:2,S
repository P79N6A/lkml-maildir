Well I thought people might be seeing the same things... it's just Linus
kernel with FC3 config....
lots of things like:.. some ntpd ones as well..
audit(1104309139.067:0): avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=3222
exe=/sbin/minilogd name=/ dev=tmpfs ino=464
scontext=user_u:system_r:syslogd_t tcontext=user_u:object_r:tmpfs_t
tclass=dir
RH have said before that they try to keep their Fedora kernels as close to
Linus as possible, just wondering is this one area they've gone their own
way..
Dave.
