Why are you not complaining that Linus does not distribute the keys he uses
to sign kernel source distributions? If a digital signature is part of the
distribution, why is the key used to produce that signature not part of the
distribution?
If you can cite some legal reason there is a difference, I would be quite
impressed.
In any event, the argument is obvious nonsense. The signature is merely
aggregated with the kernel. Cooperation, dependent function, and convergent
design can't break mere aggregation or you get ridiculous results. (For
example, a device shipped with the Linux kernel and some applications would
have to GPL all the applications.)
