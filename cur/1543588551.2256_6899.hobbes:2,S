Only <include/asm-alpha/compiler.h> defines the following, but I
think we need this for other architectures, too.
/* Somewhere in the middle of the GCC 2.96 development cycle, we implemented
   a mechanism by which the user can annotate likely branch directions and
   expect the blocks to be reordered appropriately.  Define __builtin_expect
   to nothing for earlier compilers.  */
#if __GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ < 96
#define __builtin_expect(x, expected_value) (x)
#endif
