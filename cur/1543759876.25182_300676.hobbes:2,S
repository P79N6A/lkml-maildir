It should probably just use its own hotplug agent instead of calling
the helper directly.

When you're submitting a patch for inclusion, the interface should really
be stable. I'd completely drop all references to the old version and only
support one interface here. Moreover, you should not do versioned interfaces
unless you expect incompatible changes in future releases. As long as you
still do, that is a sign that the patch is not ready for inclusion.

Nothing about the init command seems really necessary. Why not just do 
that stuff from an /sbin/init script?

That sounds really dangerous. Can you guarantee that nothing unexpected happens
when a malicious user calls the ioctls with FB_SPLASH_IO_ORIG_KERNEL from a
regular user process?

Then don't make it pointer but instead a field of that length. Pointers
in ioctl arguments only cause trouble in mixed 32/64 bit environments.

This should not be needed. I notice you are creating your own miscdevice
for passing ioctl commands. That seems a little backwards since there
already is a character device for the frame buffer. Can't you simply
add your ioctl commands there?

As I mentioned, this means there is thinko in your locking scheme.

This is very wrong. Using ioctl() for anything is bad enough because it
contains an indirection from a system call. Here, you add yet another
indirection. Instead of this, you should at least have a single data
structure for each ioctl number, without using pointers to other structures.
