It turns out, that this is caused by console=ttyS0,115200n8.  Without
the problematic driver found by pm_trace for the old Pinacle SAT card...

...and the serial console, I can now suspend to ram just fine with stock
2.6.19-rc6.  As a serial port test, I set up a getty on ttyS0, and
logged in via minicom prior to suspend.  After resume, the serial port
isn't talking.  Kill -9 the shell though, and all is fine again.

Makes no difference for vanilla, works just fine either way, I don't
even have to remove vga=0x314. The RT kernel has some issues in this
area with s2ram, but that's a different story.
	Hope you're having/had a nice weekend, and thanks for the tips!
