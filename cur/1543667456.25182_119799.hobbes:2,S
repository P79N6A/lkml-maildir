You will never get distros to follow that. A 'featured-kernel-for-distro'...
Just take RH and SuSE (correct me if I'm wrong...)
RH ships -ac. SuSE ships -aa. At least both (-ac and -aa) have O(1) scheduler
now. -ac ships rmap, -aa ships -aa (;)). That means O(1) goes in your kernel,
but how about the VM subsystem ? 
But now that -ac does not include rmap, perhaps the VM can be chosen as the
one from Andrea...
(BTW, I have been runnin plan -pres for a couple of weeks, and now that I run
-aa again, my computer looks like a new one...)
