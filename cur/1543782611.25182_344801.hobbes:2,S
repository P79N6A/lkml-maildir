While looking at this have you considered 64bit rlimits on a 32bit box.
If a new API is going to be added it would be a good time to fix the
fact that some limits should be 64bit nowdays and have 
setrlimit()		existing legacy/standards API
setprlimit64()		with size fixed and ability to specify process
Any thoughts on this ?
