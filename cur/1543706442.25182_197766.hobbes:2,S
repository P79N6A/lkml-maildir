it's valid there's no point in searching further for an area of at least 
len bytes.  The user area is 0 .. TASK_SIZE-1.  The addr is the address 
currently being checked, the len is the requested length.  if addr+len is 
greater or equal to TASK_SIZE then the current addr (which is increasing 
within this loop) already causes such a mapping to overflow into kernel 
space (exceeds the TASK_SIZE virtual address limit).  This is precisely as 
expected.
I'd assume your program has fragmented memory to such a level that a 
single consecutive 100 MB area is no longer free (not that hard to do, 
since TASK_SIZE is 3 GB).
Cheers,
MaZe.
