It doesn't work for me. Maybe i can't understand what you are trying to
do, anyway.
General suggestion is can be:
   sed -e 's_[ \t]*$__'
(i.e any line on stdin with space/tab mixed tails is stripped on stdout)
You can use it as wrapper for diff, sending patch bombs, etc.
(very nice with pipes):
shell$ diff -Npu2 old new | sed -e 's_[ \t]*$__' > patch.diff
shell$ < patch-set.mbox sed -e 's_[ \t]*$__' | formail -s /usr/sbin/sendmail -bm -t 
similar in scripts; quilt (patch sets manager) notices about them.
