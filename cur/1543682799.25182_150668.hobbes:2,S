Using the latest Gnome, 2.3.4 with Mozilla and Xmms, and 2.6.0-test1 I
experience hangups and very high latency when Mozilla is retrieving a
page and XMMS is playing, which is evident from the pauses in music.
This gets worse when I'm compiling something in the background.
But once I switch back to 2.4.20-ck6, everything runs normal even under
5 minute compiles.
Also, I have low latency on in 2.6.0-test1.
Am I missing a setting or is the scheduler still buggy?
If you need more info, email me.
