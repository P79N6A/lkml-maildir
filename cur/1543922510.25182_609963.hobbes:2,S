Yes.  If that were to be the justifying case and if that was what
the code was implementing I could see the point.
However this point was made in an earlier review.  This point
was already been made, and still this patchset doesn't
include that functionality and it still includes the code
to disable direct hardware access for no seemingly sane
reason.
