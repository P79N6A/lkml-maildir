No, it needs to sit in -mm for a while.  All of the new 2.6.18 stuff
already has been in there, this is a bit too late for it.  I have no
problem with taking this and letting it get beat on for a few months and
then go into 2.6.19.

No, see above please.

I don't object to genirq to go in now for 2.6.18, but this series is too
new.  Incremental changes please :)
