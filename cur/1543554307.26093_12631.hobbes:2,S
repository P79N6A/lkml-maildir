It is a bit late (just came back from the systems'00 fair), but Jeff
Merkey just acknowledged that indeed he meant me with "Marc Lehman". I
have no idea why he wrote such a thing, since I never mentioned something
like that, nor did I verify anything like this (given that the sentence
doesn't make much sense, either).
Jeff, I never said such a thing and I would appreciate if you didn't put
your words into my mouth.
*puzzled*
