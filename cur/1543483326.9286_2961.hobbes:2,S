We had the same problem. It was a hardware problem (memory and/or
controller, I don't know these gory details). Fsck consumed a lot of memory
and was using those bad addresses.
We tried first booting with 2.0.34, 2.0.35, 2.0.36 and 2.1.130 (yes, I keep
three or four kernel images in the disk...) withouth success. Then I
rebooted the kernel with mem=32M  (the machine had 128M) and I could finally
finished the fsck, with 48 and 64 we've got a lot of signal 11 errors.
