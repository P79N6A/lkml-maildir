Subject: [PATCH] libata: limit post SRST nsect/lbal wait to ~100ms
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/10/11

After SRST, libata used to wait for nsect/lbal to be set to 1/1 for
the slave device.  However, some ATAPI devices don't set nsect/lbal
after SRST and the wait itself isn't too useful as we're gonna wait
for !BSY right after that anyway.
Before reset-seq update, nsect/lbal wait failure used to be ignored
and caused 30sec delay during detection.  After reset-seq, all
timeouts are considered error conditions making libata fail to detect
such ATAPI devices.
This patch limits nsect/lbal wait to around 100ms.  This should give
acceptable behavior to such ATAPI devices while not disturbing the
heavily used code path too much.

Okay, here it is.  Sorry for the delay.
