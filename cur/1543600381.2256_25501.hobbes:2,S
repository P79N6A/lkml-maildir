No trivial way.  Need to read some more code to see how the parser
works and if the data structures are build in a way that I have the
informations I need at any point to do that "on-the-fly" in the
pnp bios node => struct pci_dev parser.
BTW:  There is another issue I've noticed on my Desktop box, where I'm
not sure what the best way to deal with:  Some pnpbios-reported I/O
ranges clash with stuff reserved by pci quirks:
This we have in PCI space (good old Intel BX):
bogomips root ~# lspci -v -s 00:04.3
00:04.3 Bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 02)
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 9
drivers/pci/quirks.c reserves this for the ACPI bridge:
bogomips root ~# cat /proc/ioports
[ ... ]
e400-e43f : Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI
e800-e81f : Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI
pnpbios lists the ACPI ports too:
bogomips root ~# lspnp -v
[ ... ]
0f PNP0c02 system peripheral: other
        io 0x0290-0x0297
        io 0xe400-0xe43f
        io 0xe800-0xe83f
Hmm...
