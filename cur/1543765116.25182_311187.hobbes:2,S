Ok, this adds a new information. Let me explain what I understand now.
When a new component is added to the kernel, let's say support for a new 
file system, a .config entry is created (CONFIG_MYFS=y|m). Why is this 
entry breaking compatibility? I mean, symbols still remains the same. 
The addition of symbols is not a breaking point.

What about making extensive use of modules? If everything (acceptable) 
is built on modules, can you still have abi, can you still change 
modules and api implementation without breaking anything? What are the 
requisites to abi?
I'm really curious about it. How abi can be made actual, and how would 
it be if we had a completely modular kernel (not micro, but something 
alike, modular in kernel-space, not in user-space).

No, I wouldn't. Closed source is out of discussion. Optimal kernel, even 
in open source can be achieved.

Quite the same, yes. You can still have different kernels of course! By 
the way, another stupid curiosity is why /lib/modules instead of /boot? 
Because boot can be a partition and not be mounted? The same thing for 
/lib (crazy, but you can do it). I would expect a kernel and all its 
parts all in one place, not different locations...

That's the only point for me. I wouldn't make 2.6 and 2.8 kernels binary 
compatibles.
