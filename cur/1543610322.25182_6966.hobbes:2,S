By providing ADDITIONAL storage. Yes, it's slower than RAM - but it's faster 
than not having the storage at all.

BS. You don't use swap INSTEAD of RAM, but AS WELL AS. Moving less frequently 
used data to swap allows you to put more frequently used data in RAM, which 
DOES speed things up. (At least, it does if the VM system works properly :P)
By your logic, we should switch off the system RAM, too: after all, L2 cache 
is much faster again, so using RAM can only slow things down?
