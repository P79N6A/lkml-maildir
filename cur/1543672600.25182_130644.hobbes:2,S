Ok, sorry about the confusion. I was thinking of drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c
all the time. However, the problem I meant is still present in the patch
for drivers/serial/core.c, which does get built as a module, and potentially
in any other module. Note that the whole purpose of
register_ioctl32_conversion() is to be able to put the wrappers in modules:
If you put your wrapper function in a file that is never a module, you
can simply put HANDLE_IOCTL(FOO, compat_foo) in include/linux/compat_ioctl.h.
