The main difference I can see is the option 'hard'. I was mounting
the fs with 'soft'.
I am now trying to find out if the problem can occur with 'hard', too,
but I already wrote some 100 MB without problems. On the other hand, now
I expirience write stalls some times. (I'm not sure if they occured with
'soft', but I think they did not. Perhaps the stalls are caused by the
same problem as the I/O-errors when mounting 'soft'?)

Now my hard disk is really full and I wrote more than 1 GB without
an error message with nfs mounted 'hard'.
Perhaps I have to tune the retrans settings when mounting 'soft'...
