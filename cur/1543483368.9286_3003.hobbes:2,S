changing the MTU sizes wasn't fixing it.  i had them all set to 576.

yes, i saw.  on the -router- that fixed it.  setting the MTU on the eth0 of
the LAN machines did -not- fix it.  as noted in the documentation, setting
the MTU only changes for new connections, not established.  i had set my
eth0 init scripts to use the MTU of 576.
again.  this did -not- fix it.

this isn't masq, it's GRE tunneling.  no masq options are enabled in the
kernel's config.
the solution as provided and explained by AK was setting the mss on the
routes for the machines on the LAN.  this -did- fix it.
(for hj) route add default gw <gw> mss 576
the reason why mtu didn't work and mss did is for idle speculation i
would expect.
