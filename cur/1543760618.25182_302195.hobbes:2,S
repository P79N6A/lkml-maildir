Before anyone gets too excited, the modifications to the GPL licensed code
will not provide you with a working load-balancer, or anything remotely
close.  The majority of the traffic processing in BIG-IP version 9.x is
handled by the traffic management microkernel, which is unique code.
Sorry, you can't hack together your own version of BIG-IP ;).
