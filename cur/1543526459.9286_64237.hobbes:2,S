   This patch adds support for the UART in the NEC Vrc-5074 host bridge
   for VR5000 based systems.
   Since the Vrc-5074 is mainly used as a motherboard device (it can be
   used in a multi-controller setup or in a plug-in card, though), I
   decided to compile it in conditionally.
Thanks for sending it in.  I don't see any point making it a conditional
compilation, since it doesn't take that much extra memory to have an
extra entry in the pci table, and it just complicates the the
already-too-complicated kernel config.
