Are you using any modules or patches that are not in the main line
kernel?
Does your problem also occur when you build a "minimal" kernel (i.e.
remove all things from it you don't really need for booting up, e.g.
local apic, pcmcia, network support, framebuffer, mouse)?
can you boot with init=/bin/bash (or another shell) and then do 
mount /proc
apm -s
does suspending work there? (this all against a "vanilla" kernel).
The thing above was just a guess, the only difference between the 2
patches i know is that the patch which is in kernel also informs all
device drivers. So i guess there must be a "broken" device driver that
makes your supend come to a halt.
