Run 'tree' from /sys/devices/ to see the topology of how all of the
different devices in your system are hooked together.  Notice how the
usb mouse is connected to a usb controller which is connected to a pci
device, and so on.
udev can use that "chain" of devices to determine how to name your
device.
