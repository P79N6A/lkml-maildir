I cannot make it happen here, either.  2.5.43-mm2 or current devel
stuff.  Heisenbug; maybe something broke dcache-rcu?  Or the math
overflow (unlikely).

Maybe because the ext2 inode cache didn't shrink as it should have.
The dentry/inode caches are pretty much FIFO with this sort of test,
and you're showing the traditional worst-case FIFO replacement behaviour.

Well that's to be expected.  Each ext2 directory inode has highmem
pagecache attached to it, which pins the inode.  There's no highmem
eviction pressure so your normal zone gets stuffed full of inodes.
There's a fix for this in Andrea's tree, although that's perhaps a
bit heavy on inode_lock for 2.5 purposes.  It's a matter of running
invalidate_inode_pages() against the inodes as they come off the
unused_list.  I haven't got around to it yet.

OK, so there's reasonable dentry shrinkage there, and the inodes
for regular files whch have no attached pagecache were reaped.
But all the directory inodes are sitting there pinned.
