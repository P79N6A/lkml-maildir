I am dying to see an efficient checkpoint of a 300Gig usenet object spool which
is receiving articles 24x7 at about 150 a second, shared with 12 servers feeding
about 8000 clients in parallel, feeding a filtered subset of the stream to
a collection of remote sites and expiring objects at a similar rate to
arrival.
That is the challenge.
I accept without reservation the snapshot the entire box model makes sense for
a simple appliance with little state. Thats an established old old method.
