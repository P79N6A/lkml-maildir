Subject: Problems with smb mounts dropping and 2.2.0-pre2..

Anyone have any idea what is up with this?
After bringing up pre2, I installed the latest/greatest smbmount and
started to mount three shares that I normally keep around.  Two are on NT
server 4.0(sp3) and one is a Linux box running samba-1.9.18p10.
I was unable to mount the samba box at all (I haven't investigated that
yet and it may be related to the old password crypt problems). 
The NT machines I was able to mount, but after approx. an hour, one of the
two mounts dropped with a "kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3" 
and an "i/o error" when anything referenced that mount.  The only way I
found to clear it was a reboot (hard one).  This machine and the NT
servers are separated by a single route hop at 100Mb.  This same machine,
immediately prior to pre2 had been up for 26 days with all three mounts
mentioned. 
I tested with another machine to two different NT servers and again, it
started dropping the mounts. In this case, of the 4 test mounts, two were
were on each server and the dropped mount was one of two, with the other
appearing to stay up.  Incidently, the reason I tested this was is that
both the Linux test box and the NT servers are in the same broadcast
domain, only a cisco switch separates them.  The results however, were the
same as the first. 
Is this a known problem?  I've got a bit more diag. info here, but don't
want to dump it onto the list unless it's needed.
TIA,
