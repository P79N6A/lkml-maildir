yeah SIGSTOP to the jvm process group.

SIGSTOP is different from other signals because it will stop the whole
process group from continuing.  i am completely aware of how much of a
pain it is to actually trap signals and do something (for apache 2.0's
design i outlawed the use of signals because of the pains of getting
things working in 1.3.x :).
doesn't the hotspot GC work something like this:
- stop all threads
- go read each thread's $pc, and find its nearest "safety point"
- go overwrite that safety point (YUCK SELF MODIFYING CODE!! :) with
  something which will stop the thread
- start the threads and wait for them all to get to their safety points
- perform gc
- undo the above mess
the only part of that which looks challenging with kernel threads is the
$pc reading part...  ptrace will certainly get it for you, but that's a
lot of syscall overhead.
or am i missing something?
