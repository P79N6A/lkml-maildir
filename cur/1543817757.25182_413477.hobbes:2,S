I am curious as to Al's answer since he asked for the feature. It would be 
easy for me to modify the staircase cpu scheduler to allow the interactive 
and compute modes be set on a per-cpu basis if that was desired. For that to 
be helpful of course you'd have to manually set affinity for the tasks or 
logins you wanted to run on each cpu(s).
Cheers,
