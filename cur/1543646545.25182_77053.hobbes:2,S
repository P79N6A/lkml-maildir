That's not true:
CONFIG_SCSI_REPORT_LUNS:
If you want to build with SCSI REPORT LUNS support i the kernel, say Y here.
The REPORT LUNS command is useful for devices (such as disk arrays) with large numbers of LUNs where the LUN values are not contiguous (sparse LUN).
REPORT LUNS scanning is done only for SCSI-3 devices.
