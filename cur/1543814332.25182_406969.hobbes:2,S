I have an idea what might have happened. You don't advance the pending 
state, if the signal isn't queued, so that the pending state is screwed up 
afterwards. Although I don't see how it could crash the kernel (it has 
only the potential to mess up the timer queue via hrtimer_forward() a 
bit), but I don't know what other patches were applied.

That's fine.
The point is that it's currently not needed to allow the user this 
behaviour. It's a bit unfortunate that such API details were not discussed 
before it got merged - users have a tendency to (ab)use a system in the 
least expected way (especially if they somehow gotten the idea it's much 
better than the old stuff in every way).
For example no current user restarts an active timer, which could be used 
to simplify the locking. If we tightened a bit what a user is allowed to 
do, we could gain flexibility on the other side, e.g. allow drivers to 
create timer sources or how to integrate cpu timer.
