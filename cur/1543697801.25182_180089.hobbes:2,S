Can't I just not use the reserved bit (therefore effectively use the
refcount), and keep the minimal count at 1 or 2?  Will that have the same
effect as setting the reserved bit?

It looks like you'll have to wrap the pages in another structure. The
refcounts for reserved pages are effectively meaningless.
