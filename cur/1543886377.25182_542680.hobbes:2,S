Yeah I know, both of these are fixed up when the chain support is added
(patch 07). So I didn't bother fixing these up, but I will make a note
of it for the first round.

It doesn't, this first patch just allows you to convert drivers to
using for_each_sg() to loop over sg elements. Then you can later
introduce sg chaining behind their back, they don't have to know about
that.
Patch 07 is the one that enables sg chaining for x86 and includes the
generic bits for linux/scatterlist.h.
