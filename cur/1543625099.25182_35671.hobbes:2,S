Sure, but it is a consequence of a badly broken server that violates
the NFS specs concerning file handles. Rigging the client in order to
cope with *all* the consequences in terms of unfsd races is an
exercise in futility - it cannot be done.
The solution is not to keep flogging the dead horse that is unfsd. It
is to put the effort into fixing knfsd so that it can cope with all
those cases where people are using unfsd today.
Cheers,
