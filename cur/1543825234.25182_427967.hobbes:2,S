I agree we need proper drivers, but moving away from vesafb will be 
tough... moving away from vgacon is likely impossible for many many 
years yet.
Once proper hardware drivers exist, you will still need to support 
booting into a situation where you probably need video before a driver 
can be loaded -- e.g. distro installers.  Server owners will likely 
prefer vgacon over a huge video driver they will never use for anything 
but text mode console.
