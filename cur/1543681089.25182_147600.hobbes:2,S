Good, with ISO_PENALTY == 2, I can smoothly move big windows (with ISO_PENALTY == 5
it was smooth only with very small windows), but it lets me move them smoothly
during less time than stock :(

Well, I had a hard time at making xmms skip with a transparent gnome-terminal.
I could easily make xmms skip with this, but it's quite artificial.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
/* Should be near MAX_SLEEP_AVG. */
#define DELAY 20
/* With how many processes, will xmms resist? */
#define NPROC 4
int main(void)
{
    int i;
    pid_t the_pid, my_pid;
    the_pid = getpid();
    /* Make some friends. */
    for (i = 1; i < NPROC; i++)
        if (fork())
            break;
    my_pid = getpid();
    for (;;) {
        /* Wait, gain interactivity. */
        for (i = DELAY; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (the_pid == my_pid)
                printf("%d\n", i);
            sleep(1);
        }
        /* Attack! */
        if (my_pid == the_pid)
            puts("attack");
        for (i = 0; i < 100000000; i++);
    }
    return 0;
}

Interesting, let's see :)
But as the interactive bonus can already be negative I wonder what use
will have another variable.
