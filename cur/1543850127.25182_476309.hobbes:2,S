This discussion seems to involve two different solutions to two 
different problems.  If it is a simple counter you want to be able to 
poll, then sysfs/debugfs is an appropriate place to make the count 
available.  If it is a detailed log of IO requests that you are after, 
then blktrace is appropriate.
I did not read the patch to see, so I must ask: does it merely keep 
statistics or does it log events?  If it is just statistics you are 
after, then clearly blktrace is not the appropriate tool to use.
