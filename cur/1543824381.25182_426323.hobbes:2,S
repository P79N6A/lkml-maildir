You're right.  I tried 2.6.16.18, which has the smbus patch, but it
didn't help the resume.  I need to test more whether it helps the fan,
but I doubt it will.
2.6.17-rc4 (with vanilla DSDT) does strange things to the fan.  At
boot, the fan is often on.  The trip point is 37 C (the DSDT default)
and temperature, say, 40 C.  That's fine and the fan should be on.
But if I set the trip point to 45 C and the poll interval to 100
seconds, the fan remains on.  I have to set the trip point and polling
interval a second time for the fan to turn off.  With 2.6.16-rc5, it
would turn off after the first setting.
Also, and I need to check which kernel it is (either 2.6.16.18 or
2.6.17-rc4), during S3 sleep, the right speaker made a quiet hiss.  I
imagine that will run down the battery pretty quickly.  It's a new
behavior since 2.6.16-rc5.
