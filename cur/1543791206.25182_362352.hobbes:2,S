I'm seeing the blank screen on the c7x0 models but my spitz kernels are
all working.
I've traced the c7x0 problem to this patch:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=90072059d2963dec237ae0cf49831ef77ddb5739
I've asked Russell and he doesn't know what's wrong. I'm trying to write
a patch which reverts this from 2.6.13-git3 but its complicated by some
of the later arm patches.
I was surprised the c7x0 problem happened and yet spitz was fine so
perhaps this is related to your problem.
