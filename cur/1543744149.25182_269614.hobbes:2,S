It could be anything. An interrupt went walkies which could easily be
the driver, thermals, cabling, phase of the moon, drive,... If those are
the only logged lines then the drive hasn't reported any problems back.
Failed maxtors normally make it very clear they died - both in smart
data (usually) and by spewing drive level errors.
