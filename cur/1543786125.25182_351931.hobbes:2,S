You may find that when printk() is a static inline there are still copies
of the control string in the generated kernel image:
	printk("foo %d\n", bar());
must still evaluate bar() and may cause "foo %d\n" to turn up in vmlinux. 
IIRC later versions of gcc do remove the unreferenced string.
If printk is a macro, it all of course disappears.
