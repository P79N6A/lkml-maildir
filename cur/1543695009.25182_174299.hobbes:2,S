Problem solved ...
I wrote that playing around with read ahead settings (hdparm -a ...) did 
not help.
In fact I was wrong, I assumed that these had identical meaning in the 
2.4 and
2.6 kernel series and tried nothing higher than 255 (2.4.x maximum). 
With 255
kernel 2.4.0 performed 50% better than 2.6.0.
After hdparm -a 8192 /dev/hd?: 2.6.0 performs 10% better than 2.4.0
Shouln´t the default settings be corrected?
