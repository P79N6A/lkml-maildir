If you want bidirectional communication, something like SOCK_SEQPACKET
or SOCK_DGRAM is better suitable. And if we learn open() to open
unix sockets, even 'echo' can be still used for configuring. I understand 
that it is radical change, but why these configuration points should
look like real files if they are not ones? And you do not have troubles
with supporting lseek() on them - if contents of file is "minutes\n",
is it correct to do lseek(fd, 1, SEEK_SET); write(fd, "onths\n", 6);
or is it incorrect usage?
If you do not want to change these objects from files to sockets,
I agree with your explanation for write(). But I do not agree with this
semantic for read() - reading byte after byte, and reading in one big 
chunk should not yield in different results on regular files, otherwise 
couple of nasty surprises is hidding there.
