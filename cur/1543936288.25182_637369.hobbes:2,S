I'm not too fond of the tree either, but it serves an important purpose
as well - we need to be careful in calling bmap() as not to deadlock the
fs under vm pressure. So the current code punts to a thread for bmap()
on extents we don't already have stored in loop. And that slows things
down of course, we would have to still punt every IO to loopd instead of
just doing a quick remap. But...

... things are already moving forward, Chris has a new interface for
this and tied it in with the loop fastfs mode. I think he'll post it
later today.
