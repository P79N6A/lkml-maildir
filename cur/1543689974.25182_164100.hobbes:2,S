Yes; I've lost the specific context of the thread, but I have been
working on MWI/cacheline size issues along with IvanK for a while.
It's apparently the responsibility of the OS to fill in correct
PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE values, which in the case of generic kernels must be
filled in at runtime (pci_cache_line_size) not at compile-time
(SMP_CACHE_BYTES, etc.)
If you don't call pci_set_mwi() for a PCI device, which triggers the
cacheline size fixups and other checks, then using
Memory-Write-Invalidate (MWI) is definitely wrong.  Or on an older
kernel, without the latest MWI changes, you could wind up programming
cacheline size to a value smaller than your current processor (again,
due to generic kernels).
If a feature/device/whatever can be programmed with cacheline size at
runtime, that will always be the preference.  With a compile-time
constant for cacheline size, you are _guaranteed_ it will be wrong in
some case.
