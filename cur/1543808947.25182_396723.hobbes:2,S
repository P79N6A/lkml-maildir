Good question.  idedisk_setup() seems more logical but in the current
model "io_32bit" setting is still accessible without ide-disk driver through
/proc/ide/ interface so...
Moreover the current drive->no_io_32bit code in ide-disk is wrong:
* it shouldn't be overriding drive->no_io_32bit flag if it is 1
* doing this in ide-disk may be too late w.r.t. ide_add_generic_settings()
Therefore your previous suggestion is the right one - the best place
to deal with ->no_io_32bit is ide-probe.c - doing this for all drives at
the end of probe_hwif() should fix all above issues.
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
