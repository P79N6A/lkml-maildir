gz doesn't matter, the `ls` ordering is the only thing that matters. You
can gzip -d * and then apply [0123]* and see if it still breaks.

something like this will apply cleanly, if every patch is self contained
as it should, it will compile correctly too:
	rm ../2.4.20pre11aa1/*.bz2
	gzip -d ../2.4.20pre11aa1/*.gz
	for i in ../2.4.20pre11aa1/[0123]*; patch -p1 < $i; done
