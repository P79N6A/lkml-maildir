Subject: [2.4.21-rc1] Zipdrive messages too much

I included ppa and scsi in my kernel since I have a parallel port 
zipdrive. Problem I am having is that it keeps scanning the drive for 
too much too often. Anytime I mount/unmount, plug/unplug USB and 
firewire devices, or at random times, I get the following messages on my 
console and in my messages file.
Apr 23 11:41:35 aeon kernel: sda : READ CAPACITY failed.
Apr 23 11:41:35 aeon kernel: sda : status = 1, message = 00, host = 0, 
driver = 08

Apr 23 11:41:35 aeon kernel:  unable to read partition table
Apr 23 11:41:35 aeon kernel: Device not ready.  Make sure there is a 
disc in the drive.
This gets really annoying, but I like to use my zipdrive.
Let me know if more information is needed.
Thanks,
David
