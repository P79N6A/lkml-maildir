It's not getting merged, SINCE IT DOESN'T WORK. It causes all sorts of 
problems, because ACPI requires all kinds of things to be up and running 
in order to actually work, and that in turn breaks all the devices that 
have different ordering constraints.
ACPI is a piece of sh*t. It asks the OS to do impossible things, like 
running it early in the config sequence when it then at the same time 
wants to depend on stuff that are there *late* in the sequence. It's not 
the first time this insane situation has happened, either.
But we'll try to merge the patch that totally switches around the whole 
initialization order hopefully early after 2.6.20. But no way in hell do 
we do it now, and I personally suspect we'll end reverting it when we do 
try it just because it will probably break other things. But we'll see.
In the meantime, sky2 doesn't work with MSI.
