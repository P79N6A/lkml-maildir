2.4.4 was the last kernel to pass the first stage of internal validation
where I work. (Okay, the first stage is me. :P). And the last to make it
out to the developers.
2.4.5 was pulled because of lkml reports of panics when unmounting
filesystems, and 2.4.7-9 all died or skrewed up on my test battery (a
couple of dd's to /dev/null, ping -f localhost, make -j32 && make modules
-j32 in /usr/src/linux)
2.4.10 just passed the first stage, and is entering the second stage of
evaluation, of which I know not what they do to it.
I'd say try it on a non-production system, beat on it for a while, and see
what comes out ...
