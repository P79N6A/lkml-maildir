your version seems to be ok. i tested it with all two-bit combinations
of dividend and divisors,  i.e.
for (b1 = 63; b1 > 0; b1--) {
    for (b2 = b1-1; b2 > 0; b2--) {
        for (b3 = 31; b3 > 0; b3--) {
            for (b4 = b3-1; b4 > 0; b4--) {
                dividend = (1ULL<<b1) | (1ULL<<b2);
                divisor = (1UL<<b3) | (1UL<<b4);
                testdiv(dividend, divisor);
            }
        }
    }
}
and it seems to be ok (and it catches the problem you pointed out). is
that an interesting enough subset? :-)
anyway, here's a new patch tested as above and with the original
nanosleep problem. (i removed the top variable from your version since
it's not used)
thx
