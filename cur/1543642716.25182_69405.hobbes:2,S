There's also the following effect that could generate additional
interrupts: the *same* IRQ source that is currently executing might
generate a (spurious but otherwise harmless) interrupt if we first ACK the
card then ACK the APIC and then do processing. Our current way of masking
interrupts in the IO-APIC at least leaves them pending there until the
handler's main work loop is finished and mitigates irqs.
