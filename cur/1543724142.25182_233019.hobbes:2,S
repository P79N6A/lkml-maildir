Not until the current scheduler is replaced with a single priority array 
scheduler.  However, if there's enough interest, I could add this 
functionality to the CPU scheduler evaluation patch so that people could 
experiment with it (BUT it would be at the bottom of my to do list).

I'll leave this question to someone more knowledgeable.
