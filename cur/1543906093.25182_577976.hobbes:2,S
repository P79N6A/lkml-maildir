RFC: Deprecate a.out ELF interpreter support
The Linux ELF loader is quite complicated and messy code (that could
probably need a rewrite, but that's a different chapter). One particular
messy part in it is the support for non ELF a.out ld.sos. This 
was originally added to make transition from a.out to ELF easier
because an a.out ELF ld.so could be still build using an older
a.out toolkit. But by now that should be fully obsolete and removing
it would clean up binfmt_elf.c up a bit.
I propose to deprecate this support and remove for 2.6.25.
Drawback is that someone still runs their system with a.out ld.so
they would need to update the ld.so when updating to a new kernel.
This patch just adds an entry to the deprecation file and a printk
warning users.
Comments?

+What:  a.out interpreter support for ELF executables
+When:  2.6.25
+Files: fs/binfmt_elf.c
+Why:   Using a.out interpreters for ELF executables was a feature for
+       transition from a.out to ELF. But now it is unlikely to be still
+       needed anymore and removing it would simplify the hairy ELF
+       loader code.
