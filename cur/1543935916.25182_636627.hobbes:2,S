yeah, agreed, we'll clean this all up, and move the other testcode there 
too, ok? There's rcutorture, lock-selftests, rt-tester, 
kprobes-smoke-test and now backtracetest.
Arjan might as well want to use the opportunity and break new kernel 
namespace ground by creating the tests/ directory for the first time in 
Linux history and introduce tests/backtracetest.c :-)
