n_tty.c seems to do it in read_chan(), i.e. it will happen when the
process reading from the TTY is currently in read(2) while at the same time
new characters arrive on the serial port.

Interesting, that should solve my problem. But then the next question is:
What's the use of the DONT_FLIP bit if it's legal to bypass it by calling
receive_buf() directly?
Also, if somebody enables low_latency using setserial with the standard
serial driver, he can still trigger the race condition. It's not very
likely to happen, but it does happen - I added code to flush_to_ldisc() to
detect concurrent calls and it triggered once during an over-night test.
Thanks,
Martin
