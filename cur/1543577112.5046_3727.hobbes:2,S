Are you still running 2.4.0-pre?  Can you reproduce the problem?  Does
the problem occur only with v4l?  Did you back up your files?
BTW, while spelunking the swap code I noticed this oddity:
  pte_t pte_mkdirty(pte_t pte) { (pte).pte_low |= _PAGE_DIRTY; return
pte; }
and similarly for 10 or so other functions - these functions just return
the passed pte, and reassign it to the pte orginally passed.  :-/ This
dates from version 1.2.13.
