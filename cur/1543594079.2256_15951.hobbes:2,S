Subject: [BUG] stat.st_size is not set for pipes

Hi,
I have upgraded from 2.4.2 to 2.4.5 and noticed a difference between the 
output of fstat() for pipes using the following testprogram:
--------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
main()
{
    FILE *f;
    struct stat buf;
    int retval;
    f = popen("echo -n test", "r");
    retval = fstat(fileno(f), &buf);
    printf("Data: %d, %d\n", retval, buf.st_size );
    pclose(f);
}
--------
Under 2.0.x, 2.2.x and 2.4.2 st_size reports the 4 bytes of the "test" 
string, 2.4.5 reports 0. 
Please CC to my email address also, as I'm not subscribed to the list. I 
checked the archives and hope I didn't miss a previous discussion of this.
