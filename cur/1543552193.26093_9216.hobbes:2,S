I guess I'll have to quote Larry McVoy here ...

they are not."

*nod*
If there is anybody around who seriously believes C++ would
be a good language for kernel modules, consider this a
challange to show us that this is the case.
I'm willing to look at code and/or benchmark numbers showing
that you people are right, but assertions that nobody backs
up with code go into /dev/null pretty quickly...
