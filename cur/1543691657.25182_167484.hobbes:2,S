The patch we submitted adds 4 generic hooks to the existing set of
profiling hooks.  These additional hooks can be used to help performance
tools such as Oprofile and VTune to not mis-attribute performance data.

We are open to the possibility of including the VTune driver into the
base kernel, perhaps in an architecture-dependent area.  It could
complement existing profilers.
