Ehh. 
The Mars Pathfinder is just about the worst case "real system", and if I 
recall correctly, the reason it was able to continue was _not_ because it 
handled priority inversion, but because it reset itself every 24 hours or 
something like that, and had debugging facilities..
The _real_ lesson you should take away from it is not that priority 
inheritance is a good solution to priority inversion, but that having a 
failsafe switch when everthing goes wrong is critical. You don't know 
_what_ bug you'll encounter.
The bug itself could have been solved without priority inheritance, 
although I think in this case enabling that in VxWorks was the particular 
solution to the problem as being the least invasive.
Personally, I don't care what user space does. If some app wants to use 
priority inheritance to solve its bugs, that's fine. But it's like 
recursive locks: it's generally a _bandaid_ for bad locking. I definitely 
don't want the kernel depending on either.
So put a watchdog on your critical systems, and make sure you can debug 
them. Especially if they're on Mars.
