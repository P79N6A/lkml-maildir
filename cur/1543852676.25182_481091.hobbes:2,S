Yes it is sad. And the sadest part is that AMD and Intel have been asked
to fix that more than 5 years ago. They did not get their brain straight
and now we are the dimwits.

TSC is simply a nightmare:
- Frequency changes with CPU clock
- Unsynced across CPUs
- Stops in C3, which makes it completely unusable
Once you take away periodic interrupts it is simply broken. AMD and
Intel can run in circels, it does not get better.
