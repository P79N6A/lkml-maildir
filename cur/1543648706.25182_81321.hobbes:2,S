Well here's some low-hanging fruit:
mnm:/usr/src/25> size kernel/pid.o
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   1677    1088  131104  133869   20aed kernel/pid.o
(I have a trollpatch to fix this)
And the radix_tree_node mempool is 140k; I plan to do away with
that altogether.
timer.c and sched.c have significant NR_CPUS bloat problems on SMP.
Working on that.
