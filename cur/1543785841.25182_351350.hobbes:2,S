Fix them and run Lindent again, that's it.
Lindent behaviour wrt labels is far more annoying, ditto for the mess it
often makes out of prototypes (demonstrated in the patch in question).
IME the best way to use Lindent is to do vi -c 's/[[:space:]]*$//|x' foo.c
first, then run Lindent, then walk through prototypes and fix them,
diff with pre-Lindent version and see if it looks sane...
