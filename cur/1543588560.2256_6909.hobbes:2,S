No. Nearly all code is GPL or GPL compatible license.

I resign my proposal. Kernel sources are clean. I confused with the
(obsolete) libg++ which have file that start with GPL license,
at the bottom of file I find the BSD license and sometime in the
middle there is also some univesity license, thus libg++ users
should scann all file to see the copyright. Luckly the linux code is
more clean.
