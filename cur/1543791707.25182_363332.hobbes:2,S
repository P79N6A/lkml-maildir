No, that was me and Matthew Dobson, circa 2.5.71.  The thinking was that
highmem is just for userspace pages and we don't need to keep the free
memory pool around for things like atomic allocations.  Especially as a
proportionally-sized highmem emergency pool would be potentially hundreds of
(wasted) megabytes.
iirc, things worked ok with a highmem min_pages threshold of zero pages.  Back
in 2.5.70, before everyone else broke it ;)
