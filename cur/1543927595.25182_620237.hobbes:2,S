There was a brain fart on the explaination of why it's wrong.
Here is a better explaination.
Executing this script.............
cat <<EOF >/tmp/xxx.c
#include <stdio.h>
#define IS_ALIGNED(x,a)		(((x) % ((typeof(x))(a))) == 0)
#define _IS_ALIGNED(x, a)	(((x) & ((typeof(x))(a) - 1)) == 0)
int main()
{
    int i;
    long p = 0x12345678;
    for(i=1; i< 0x11; i++)
        printf("Old = %d, new = %d\n", IS_ALIGNED(p, i), _IS_ALIGNED(p, i));
     return 0;
}
EOF
gcc -Wall -o /tmp/xxx /tmp/xxx.c
/tmp/xxx
... produces:
Old = 1, new = 1
Old = 1, new = 1
Old = 1, new = 1
Old = 1, new = 1
Old = 0, new = 1
Old = 1, new = 1
Old = 0, new = 1
Old = 1, new = 1
Old = 1, new = 0
Old = 0, new = 0
Old = 0, new = 0
Old = 1, new = 0
Old = 0, new = 0
Old = 0, new = 0
Old = 0, new = 0
Old = 0, new = 0
Which is clearly different.
