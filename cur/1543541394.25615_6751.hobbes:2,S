Greetings!  Just to add another report in the same vein.  
hdb: HP COLORADO 14GB, ATAPI TAPE drive
Aug 11 10:26:06 intech20 kernel: ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
Aug 11 10:26:06 intech20 kernel: ide-tape: hdb: overriding capabilities->speed (assuming 650KB/sec)
Aug 11 10:26:06 intech20 kernel: ide-tape: hdb: overriding capabilities->max_speed (assuming 650KB/sec)
1) Generic 2.2.16 -- mt status gives
	Aug 10 16:35:19 intech20 kernel: ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc
	=  8, key =  5, asc = 2c, ascq =  0	
	Everything else basically works.
2) 2.2.16 with ide patch
        mt status error as above
	writing tape appears to work
	can't read tape beyond a certain length
Take care,
