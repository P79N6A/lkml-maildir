Is the idea that the skb data pointer instead will be a kiovec ? So that
the kiovec can point to the locked down COW-marked pages in memory where
the data came from, released when TCP finally acks it ? 
But the tail and head of the skb, that will still be in skb-local memory
right ?
A scatter gather ethernet driver can then setup a DMA chain to send skb
head, the kiovec's, and the skb tail, for each skb.
I'd love to see that work - we run linux on embedded HW and every less
copying of data can be a pretty performance win. And our ethernet HW is
already scatter-gather.

Yeah, it'd be pretty stupid if an application forces the COW to trigger
all the time, then you'd still be copying data :)
But like others said, sendfile is probably the most excellent first
subject to try this stuff on!
