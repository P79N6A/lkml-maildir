In 2.6, warnings are very visible, and many people are working on 
reducing the number of warning.
A full build of 2.6 gives between 200 and 300 warnings with gcc 3.3 
including harmless ones.
You get several "unused variable" warnings when you disable e.g.
CONFIG_PROC_FS.
When compiling with a different compiler version (e.g. 2.95) you get a 
similar number of warnings, but different warnings.
Some warnings are the fault of gcc (and noone will fix gcc 2.95 or the 
unofficial gcc 2.96).
Adding -Werror will turn into a maintenance nightmare.
