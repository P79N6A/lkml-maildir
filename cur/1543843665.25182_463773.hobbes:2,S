Agree.  And they are details that can be fixed.
One such detail we still see issue with is kretprobes though (which we 
use on LKET for systemcall exit).  These have problem scaling due to 
spinlock issues even on small smp systems.  Its an implementation issue 
that can be fixed but I've been told that the fix is not trivial and 
should not expect it anytime soon.

Agree here as well.  Sorry, I was also counting static markers as  
static  tracepoint as well.  Even with static markers, there need to be 
balance of what thing need to be implemented with markers vs those that 
can just be done dynamically.
