Here's what I could dig up:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.7/2.6.7-mm2/broken-out/larger-io-bitmap.patch
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.0/0477.html
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9807.1/1079.html
Looks like x86-64 does in fact need a similar change to the x86 one. It's late 
here, but it should be pretty trivial to port over.
