gfs needs to run in the kernel.  dlm should run in the kernel since gfs uses it
so heavily.  cman is the clustering subsystem on top of which both of those are
built and on which both depend quite critically.  It simply makes most sense to
put cman in the kernel for what we're doing with it.  That's not a dogmatic
position, just a practical one based on our experience.

This view of advantages/disadvantages seems sensible when working with your
average userland clustering application.  The SAF spec looks pretty nice in
that context.  I think gfs and a kernel-based dlm for gfs are a different
story, though.  They're different enough from other things that few of the same
considerations seem practical.  This has been our experience so far, things
could possibly change for some next-generation (think time span of years).
You'll note that gfs uses external, interchangable locking/cluster systems
which makes it easy to look at alternatives.  cman and dlm are what gfs/clvm
use today; if they prove useful to others that's great, we'd even be happy to
help make them more useful.
