Hello Christoph,
I am in process of testing the next version of the megaraid driver. I faced
an issue while doing the insmod-rmmod sequence. Your patch for PCI hotplug
does "pci_disable_device" when the driver is unloaded.
The insmod-rmmod-insmod fails the first time unless you do an explicit
pci_set_master at driver load time, since pci_enable_device does not seem to
enable bus mastering, which is disabled by pci_disable_device.
Even with pci_set_master, insmod stalls the CPU after about 2-3 hours of
insmod-rmmod sequence. So I took out the pci_disable_device altogether to
find out it takes only longer, about 9 hours, but CPU stalls at the exact
location again with a NMI watchdog. It happens when the driver issues the
first command to the FW, which is never received by it and driver gets stuck
in a forever cpu_relax loop waiting for the command to complete
After an hour or two I get "Unable to proc_mkdir in
scsi.c/build_proc_dir_entries", but that's another story.
The kernel is a genre of 2.4.21
Any ideas....
Thanks
