Beta PDC20262 Promise Ultra66 support.
WARNING :: WARNING :: WARNING :: WARNING
ONLY tested to ATA-33 standards and currently running on my personal
system at home.  ATA-66 or UDMA 4/3 is unchecked and not chipset tunable.
You are on you own if you use an ATA-66 device, but reports are welcome.
2.2.6.uniform-ide-6.19.patch.gz only has this new chipset.
