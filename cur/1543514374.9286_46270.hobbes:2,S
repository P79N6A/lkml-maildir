The motherboard is a TMC TI5VG+.  For the chipset my user's manual says
the MVP3 has built-in PCI EIDE with support for UDMA/33.  lspci reports
the following:
00:07.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586 IDE [Apollo] (rev
06) (prog-if 8a)
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop-
ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort-
<TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 64 set
        Region 4: I/O ports at e000
I've seen the chips it mentions, but haven't seen any of VIA's docs
mentioning capabilities.  I should visit VIA's website.  I think some
people on lkml consider the chipset broken.
Looking further, I read Documentation/Configure.help and found some
interesting info there.  I also see that both CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI, and
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI are not set.  I have this memory of reading
about those needing to be unset in order to make ide-scsi emulation
work.  If that is true I may be stuck choosing between UDMA and ide-scsi
emulation (needed for my CD-RW to work).
