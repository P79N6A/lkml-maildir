OK, but even architectures with bigger HZ values will suffer. Isn't it
better to set MIN_NICE_TSLICE to a smaller value (such as 1000) and
fix the calculation in fill_tslice_map to make sure ts_table[i] is
always non-zero. The current formula will break anyway if
        HZ < 1000000 / MIN_NICE_TSLICE = 100,
but maybe HZ >= 100 is true for all architectures?
