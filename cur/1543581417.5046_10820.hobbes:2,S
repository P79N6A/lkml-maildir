In a nutshell, you can't!
There is the requirement for some small delays when performing
certain kernel functions. Therefore, upon startup, a delay
loop is calibrated by checking how many times the delay-loop
gets executed between two or more hardware interrupts. The
hardware interrupts occur at quite precise intervals so the
calibration can be quite accurate.
A side-effect of the calibration is a loop-count variable.
I should have been called "Loop count", but instead, it
was called "bogomips". Many persons assume that "bogomips"
has some relationship to CPU speed or machine capability.
It doesn't. It can only be claimed that a CPU with a faster
core clock might result in a larger loop-count. In fact
a CPU with a faster core-clock might even show a lesser
loop-count because of differences in internal cache management
or branch-prediction with different CPUs.
