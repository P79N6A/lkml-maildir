The manual page is confusing.  It even admits to being "intentionally 
vague".  However the goal seems clear:
    "pivot_root() moves the root file system of the current process to
    the directory put_old and makes new_root the new root file system of
    the current process"
    -- man 2 pivot_root
There's an argument that pivot_root could be improved...
