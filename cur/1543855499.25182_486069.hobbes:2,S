This will cause the output format to be dependent upon the setting of
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE.  So any code which attempts to parse the output
of this function will somehow need to work out whether or not the `free'
field is present.
Which is why we still print out a zero if CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE=n.
