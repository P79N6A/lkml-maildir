Actually, I think you have the driver RPMs confused with the driver 
itself.  We supply prebuilt RPMs for all of the major RPM-based distros 
with every driver release.
All of the source code that interacts with the Linux kernel is available 
in the kernel driver tarball.  This has allowed many people to run the 
driver on the officially-unsupported 2.5 kernels, for instance.
The current driver supports all kernels from 2.2.12 through to 2.4.18 
(at least).
