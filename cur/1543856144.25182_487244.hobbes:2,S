Nothing yet. To begin with, this is just a documentation mechanism. I'll 
be trying to push page clustering one piece at a time which will need 
this. The markings may also be of interest to containers and to pagesets 
because it will clearly flag what are allocations in use by userspace.

according to grep -r, alloc_zeroed_user_highpage() is only used in two 
places, do_wp_page() (when write faulting the zero page)[1] and 
do_anonymous_page() (when mapping the zero page for the first time and 
writing). In these cases, they are known to be movable. What am I missing?
[1] I missed a call to GFP_HIGHUSER in do_wp_page() that should have been 
GFP_HIGH_MOVABLE.
