might_sleep currently _doesn't_ warn about any bug in the above case I
quoted.
the kmalloc example is trapped instead.
From my part I don't like anybody to call schedule with irq disabled
(and I would definitely put a debug check in schedule() for that, guess
how I found about the missing sti in entry.S btw). But if you are ok
with people calling schedule with irq disabled then I cannot put a check
in there. sti doesn't cost that much, and the work-to-do and sched_yield
paths are _never_ fast paths, so they don't worth an hack like that.
