Playing with the uid?  I'm just specifying the uid of the calling process
that can be setup beforehand; I'm certainly not storing it in the elf
headers, I still think that's gross.

NO!!!  It _can_ be _any_ fs that understands the sticky bit, where you
trust the sticky bit to enable caps!  With a mount option, it can be made
to work with UMSDOS, nfs, CODA, ...  The problem with this, which I am
well aware of, is that it means having to trust the sticky bit.  The
immutable bit was added to the spec for ext2 because it nicely solved the
local problems.

I don't understand what you're saying here.

I used running a shell because it's the form of attack I'm most used to
seeing.  I don't see, though, how the exploit code could transfer an
executable and 'set any special bits needed'.  If you mean raise it's
capabilities, you're incorrect.  At best the exploit code could continue
to listen on a low port.

It could dlopen() without cooperation from ld.so?  You're losing me

OK, so it's a one-way operation; once you modify your first binary, you
_never_ boot to an old kernel without patching it first?  What about
operation over nfs, where the remote filesystem now holds a setuid root
named?  Of course, it's useless on that other machine unless it's running
a patched kernel.  With the sticky bit scheme, you could export /usr from
a Linux 2.0 machine and cap-enable all the binaries.  The 2.0 machine
could run with the old security model and ignore the superflous headers,
and the 2.2 enhanced machine could run capability-enabled.  Under the
setuid0 scheme, you'll have to mark named, inetd, apache and others setuid
root.  Or, you allow them to inherit their caps, but then they are able to
spawn processes which can _also_ inherit those caps.

I'm sorry, but if you're gonna start running with capabilities, you'll
have to take the time to understand how they work, and that setuid root
doesn't mean what it used to.  That, or you're breaking the implementation
of capabilities, which is what a few of you seem hell-bent on doing.

Oh, for gosh sake!  So now you're going to completely re-design
capabilities to cope with the broken setuid0 scheme?  Just to get slightly
better behavior over a remote fs, and make cap binaries 'easily
recognizable'?  I'll eat your gym socks if such a patch ever gets in the
kernel.  Really.  I've done my damnedest to stay logical and unemotional
on this, but it's getting really ridiculous.  I've just shown above that
the stickybit/immutable scheme has a better shot at being useful over nfs;
or at least, the tradeoffs between the two schemes is a wash.  But
stickybit/immutable (ext2 only) is a truer implementation of the
capability semantics.

I agree that having local and remote mount options to enable this are an

Ok, again you've lost me here...

I'm just not in favor of turning Linux into VMS (in the security system at
least).  The capabilities support looks to me plenty flexible for most
uses, and most of it is already in the kernel.
I'm sorry if I used all caps one too many times, I'm just starting to
wonder why some people are holding on so hard to the setuid0 scheme.  I
was _completely_ in favor of it for quite a while.  Then I started reading
the linux-privs specification, and thinking of the philosophy behind it
and how it was designed to be used, and how I would use it in a real-world
situation.  To do things correctly (and I strongly emphasize correct) the
setuid0 scheme just didn't cut it.  So I cast about for a better
solution...
Don't get me wrong, I'd be thrilled to see an even _better_ suggestion.
Ecstatic, even, if people would finally let go of using setuid0.
cheers,
