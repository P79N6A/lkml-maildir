Fwiw, the Alteon Tigon-II can send & receive 60-byte packets at line
rate if you assemble them on the card, but I've not tried pushing that
over the PCI bus.  As Jes said, that's the slow part.  Special firmware
to use fewer DMAs than packets (i.e. grouping small packets) might do
the trick.  The firmware kit is open source; enjoy :-)
