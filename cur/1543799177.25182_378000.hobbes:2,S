It would be neater and faster to simply require that the platform always
put something sane bus->sysdata, even if that's a pointer to some
statically allocated struct.  IOW:
static struct pci_sysdata dummy_sysdata = { .node = -1 };
somewhere_in_initialisation()
{
	...
	if (bus->sysdata == NULL)
		bus->sysdata = dummy_sysdata;
}
