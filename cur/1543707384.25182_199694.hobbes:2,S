I have als4000 sound card and when i run kernel 2.6.3
and try to load snd-als4000 module it says:
snd_als4000: falsely claims to have parameter
joystick_port
A have not configured CONFIG_GAMEPORT
I think this happens because there are not
#ifdef SUPPORT_JOYSTICK
...
#endif
in als4000.c when module params are declared.
I attached a patch
