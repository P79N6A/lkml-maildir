Why am I suddenly reminded of apple's idiotic filesystem forks for
resources and data?  Such a pain when trying to transfer files to other
types of filesystems.  Modifying the files themselves also doesn't seem
like the right solution.
As for filenames never being long enough, I don't think that is true.
Filenames CAN be too long, but I don't see very many people think 250
characters makes for a useful filename.  Most people seem happy with 50
or so being a good limit even though many systems support much longer.
8 wasn't enough, and 25 or 30 was sometimes a bit short, but usually
enough.  Not having enough filename length doesn't seem to be a problem
in need of a solution on most systems anymore.
