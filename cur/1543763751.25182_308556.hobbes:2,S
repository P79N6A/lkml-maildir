In a sense, the information *is* already there - in node_distance.
What I think should be done is probably to use node_distance when
calculating costs, and correlate that with sched-domains as best
we can.
I've got an idea of how to do it, but I'll wait until Ingo gets the
fundamentals working wel before I have a look.

Yes, likely below noise. There is an issue with a behavioural
transition point in the wakeup code where you might see good
behaviour with 21 and bad with 25, or vice versa on some workloads.
This is fixed in the scheduler patches coming through -mm though.
But I wasn't worried so much about the absolute value not being
right, rather it maybe not being deterministic. So maybe depending
on what CPU gets assigned what cpuid, you might get different
values on identical machines.
