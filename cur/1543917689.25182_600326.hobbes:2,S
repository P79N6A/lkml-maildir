Running FC6 (updated this am) the temp sensors GNOME applet works with 
the kernel.org kernel, not the FC6 kernel. This has been true for a 
while, and I've stopped chasing it, I don't really care right now, since 
the sensors command works fine and that's what my daemon checks.
Using 2.6.23-rc8 (no git) the NIC came up at 100Mbit instead of gigE 
once, not reproducible. Just in case this kicks off a bunch of "mee too" 
replies. lspci info follows text.
Boot times: I occasionally boot repeatedly for various tests, these are 
the fastest of three (or more) boots of a given kernel, ID is what uname 
gives.
