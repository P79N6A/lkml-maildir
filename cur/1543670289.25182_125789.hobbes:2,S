We have an application that detects hardware using the libhd from SuSE.
This lib loads the driver with the NONBLOCK flag, because it doesn't want
to use the drive, but only detect it. When it releases, the File parameter
is NULL, so the counters get decremented, but were never incremented.
When we try to partition the drive, the BLKRRPART ioctl fails because the
counter is 4294967295. (-1)
I don't think any program relies on this counter being < "0".
The whole point on the file descriptor is beyond me, but I think it's a
good thing to address.
