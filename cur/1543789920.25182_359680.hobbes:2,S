Yeah, it's very much like a secondary restricted page lock.  Instead of
sleeping when you can't get the page lock, you can also try acquiring this sort
of secondary page lock bit which lets you do *very* specific things.  Maybe
it's not *that* weird, I just didn't think that the core would be interested in
supporting that notion.  I can try rolling a patch to see what a more sensible
API would look like.
