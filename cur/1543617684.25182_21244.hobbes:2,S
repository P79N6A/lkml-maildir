Try putting some printk in the function that sets the codec registers.

No if the routine to write the registers isn't called *and* the initialization
doesn't reset the codec.
The first can be verified with printks, for the second examine the code. But
via_init_one is the one to check, it calls all the initializations.

Jeff Garzik should know better ;-)
The only strange thing is the code is for the A version of the chip (desktop?)
and you have the B version (mobile?).
I got the 82C686A data sheet, but not the one for 82C686B.
