Well, yes, works for me I guess. Was playing around to see if I could 
find something a bit more subtle but it seems nothing's available. My 
BIOS does show hdc (a DVD-ROM by the way) to be udma4 in its summary 
screen but it does not enable udma for it. I saw AMD_DRIVE_TIMINGS is 
not used for udma (and programmed by my BIOS to the highest PIO mode the 
device offers for all devices present) so also of no use...
Attached patch combines this and deleting a "use ide0=ata66" advice from 
the driver.
One slight cosmetic problem, with amd_80w set unconditionally the 
/proc/ide/amd74xx file's "cable type" line will now always show "80w" 
and seems likely to confuse people that have 40w cables installed. I 
believe the proc file may be on its way out anyway? If not, one option 
could be to print "n/a" for amd_config->flags & AMD_UDMA == AMD_UDMA_66 
(<= ?).
Rene.
