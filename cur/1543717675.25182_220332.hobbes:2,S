 I got something like that, but from the console: I was just using the
computer and my keyboard locks (at console). I tryed a ssh from
another machine and it worked (nothing special in log messages too),
so I rebooted.
 It happened two times in some minutes ago. I'm looking at suspects
patches, if it happens again I will try to reverse something.
