There's only one free_irq() line, and it gets called the first time
through usb_hcd_pci_suspend().  QED.

Your logic escapes me, since your patch affected all three PCI HCDs.
If that's wrong for one, its wrong for all three.
And as I just commented to Rafael, here are two better things to try
instead of believing a diagnosis that's clearly wrong:
  - 2.6.14-rc2 
  - disabling USB keyboard/mouse/... support in your BIOS
I know there are bugs in the "usb-handoff" PCI quirk code; the folk who've
collected those code fragments didn't bother to match the code in the HCDs,
and the differences can matter [1].  The best way to avoid such stuff is
still to make sure that your BIOS just ignores USB.
