Which driver is recommended for a 4 port card?
Each driver works, I have not benchmarked performance with one over the 
other with ttcp yet; however, does anyone have any experience with using 
one over the other? I see the tulip has several options and the de4x5 
seems to be a rather generic driver.
<M>   DECchip Tulip (dc2114x) PCI support
[*]     New bus configuration (EXPERIMENTAL)
[*]     Use PCI shared mem for NIC registers 
[*]     Use NAPI RX polling 
[*]       Use Interrupt Mitigation
vs.
<M>   Generic DECchip & DIGITAL EtherWORKS PCI/EISA
