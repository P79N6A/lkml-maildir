Yes, I know. Examining Squid may help you here (or just bring your
last meal back - portable - yes, stable - yes, fast and efficient -
yes. Nice clear code? Not quite...)
Really, the kernel should "talk" to applications a lot more about
things like this. You could probably do something similar via a /proc
entry, but that's not exactly portable...
What sort of applications are these, by the way?
I suppose Unix has evolved in this way because most applications can't
be very flexible about memory usage; if an application requests 10Mb
to do something, 9Mb probably won't do. Then along come WWW servers
etc., with almost the opposite requirements - the more memory the
better, but they can operate on fairly trivial levels if needed
(thanks to overcommit).
