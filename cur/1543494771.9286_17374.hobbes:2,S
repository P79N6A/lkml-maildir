Again, after the assignment was made, there was no check of the
value. This is what Lint picked up. When you read the standard,
it talks about the value of the left operand. It also talks about
its type because of the promotion rules, that's all your cited
text shows.
Here we have a compound statement in which an assignment is
being made, i.e.,
	left = right;
Then we have a conditional expression which tests the result of
an operation:
	if(left = right)
As stated, and as Lint picked up, we are now testing if the assignment
occurred, not the value of the left-most operand. Therefore, we have
to make the assignment first:
	(left = right) ... Parenthesis for priority.
then test the result:
	if ( (left = right) ) ... exactly as Lint has shown.
Lint shows that even this is an error because the result is
not boolean. It really should be.
	if ( (left = right) == 0 )
The result of '==' is boolean which 'if' tests. It is, however,
common usage to do:
	if(value)
because there usually is a functional equivalent.
Not only does Lint pick up this common error, but so does gcc if
you turn on all the error reporting with -Wall.
