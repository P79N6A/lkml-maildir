  This is possibly more of   linux-isdn@vger.kernel.org  list thing,
  than linux-kernel per se.

 for more info.
  Quick reading of  drivers/isdn/isdn_audio.c(*)  shows that it does use
  fixed-point Görtzel (Goertzel in english) algorithm for detecting
  tones, but it does _not_ do comparison of received overall signal
  power vs. detected DTMF tone powers.
  When there is signal power outside the DTMF channels, signal should
  not be detected.  Also, DTMF tone powers should be roughly equal,
  and exactly two tones should be present for valid detection.

  Adding those power tests should be fairly trivial, but I leave it
  to Somebody Else...
(*) kernel version I looked upon was 2.4.16-0.11custom -- some RH kernel
