Could you send me your /var/log/message ?? There are some bugs in dma buffer 
management which I am currently working on. The bug is difficult to be 
reproduce on our SiS 7018 chip so I need feedback from trident's user.
The driver changed a lot since 2.3.39 but unfortunatly they are not
getting in pre-2.3.40 patches. I will send out a new revision tomorrow.
