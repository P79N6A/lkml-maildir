That's not quite what I meant ... 
The main problem with keventd I'd say is that it's used in all sort of
exeptional code path (ie, driver reset path, error handling, etc...) for
things that will msleep happily for tenth milliseconds, that sort of
thing.
IE. It will be pretty responsive -in general- but can suffer form
horrible latencies every now and then.
Cheers,
Ben.
