Here's an idea: add a CONFIGable debug mode for spinlock/cli
interaction with GFP_KERNEL and other (known) blocking operations.
Keep a per-CPU flag or bitmask that's manipulated by lock/cli
operations and checked by memory allocators and other key blocking
operations. Generate an Oops upon violation.
Make the CONFIG option initially set to 'y' for a patch level or two.
