hm.  Before it was merged in 2.5.x, the feature was very marginal from a
performance POV in my testing on 4-way.
I was able to demonstrate a large (~60%?) speedup in one microbenckmark
which consisted of four processes writing 16k to a file and truncating it
back to zero again.  That gain came from the cache warmth effect, which is
the other benefit which these cpu-local pages are supposed to provide.
I don't think Martin was able to demonstrate much benefit from the lock
contention reduction on 16-way NUMAQ either.
So I dithered for months and it was a marginal merge, so it's appropriate
to justify the continued presence of the code.
We didn't measure for any coloring effects though.  In fact, I didn't know
that this feature actually provided any benefit in that area.
