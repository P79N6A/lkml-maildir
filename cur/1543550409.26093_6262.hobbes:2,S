I doubt. There are lots of interesting journaling filesystems for
Linux aviable (xfs, ext3, jfs, reiserfs, nwfs(?), vxfs(commercial)).
And a least a few will be merged in 2.5.
For people that disklike the disadvantages of journaling fses, 
Daniel Philips is working on tux2 which is in some respect similar
to su (always writing comsitatn metadata to disk without a journal)
but the implementation seems much more interesting ;)
