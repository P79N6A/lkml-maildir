Subject: [PATCH 2/3] ptrace_stop: remove the wrong ->group_stop_count bookkeeping
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

ptrace_stop() decrements ->group_stop_count to "participate" in group stop.
This looks very wrong to me, the task can in fact decrement this counter twice.
If the tracee returns to the user-space before other threads complete the group
stop, it will notice TIF_SIGPENDING and do it again.
Another problem is that we don't set SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED if the counter becomes
zero.
I must admit, I don't undestand the reason why this code was added, it is very
old.
