This is a know problem. The problem is: we don't know yet
if a given USB configuration is a USB card, a USB kernel support
(i.e. USBFS, OHCI, EHCI...).
The solution is to modify the configuration rules, adding
the USB_CARDS (as Eric proposed for ISA_CARDS).
But this rules change can be done only after CML2 is included
into the kernel.

Eric: Rule error ?

I know. I don't know if I should autodetect APM support.
On some machine APM crash the kernel and in some more
machine you must tune the APM options.
I'm not an APM expert, so I need some help.

I have some problem with these rules.
I should find a solution on how to detect
these on a x86 wihout breaking the other
archs.
Probably the best solution is to change the rules:
the floppy disk is linked to CONFIG_FLOPPY (or an
other non conflicting names) and the various archs
controller configuration is derives from FLOPPY
and ARCH_*.

Hard to detect these 'software devices'.
Some suggestions?

hmm. I forgot these rules during the conversions.
[but ATARI PS/2 conflict with this]
