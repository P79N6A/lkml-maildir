i'm not sure that it's appropriate for LKML folks to be giving anyone
suggestions for projects.  the eventual choice of project should be
based on what *shaneed* wants, not what other people tell him he
should be doing.
in addition, sometimes part of the work involved in a school project
involves doing enough research to just make the *choice*.  what
shaneed is asking is that others do that work for him.  IMHO, he
should be told politely but firmly that selecting a topic is *his*
problem.  that's just part of the academic process.
