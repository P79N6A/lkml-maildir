Are you suggesting we should rename "etc", "mnt" etc? :-)  I like
"/dbg" it follows the gdb, kgdb naming convention and it was the Unix
way to name things like this.  Though perhaps debugfs should have been
named dbgfs in this case...
I don't like "/.debug", hiding it in way this implies that you don't
think it should be there (and so you've hidden it).  A properly
decided upon mount point shouldn't have these connotations?  If you're
using debugfs I think you should want to have the mount point visible.
