I just tested with fresh-out-of-the-box
2.4.0 and using the newer libusb 0.1.2 
as suggested by antirez  (see email chain
below for more info).  I compiled libusb
and s10sh code this AM under 2.4.0. 
It blows up BAD by finding increasingly
larger photo images in the camera over
the usb link and extracting them to disk.
So by the third file you're trying to
extract gig sized files.  Obviously the
filesystem files up, the sytem chokes, etc.
This is the same code that works fine
under 2.2.18 kernel (I use it all of the
time there).

Too bad. The problem can't be of s10sh itself I guess.
It's more likely that some USB userspace ioctl() changed
so the USB subsystem isn't access without problems,
even if it's possible that some s10sh bug grow up
with a more robust USB implementation in 2.4.0.
I tested s10sh in 2.4.0-testxxx and it worked:
I suggest to try the new libusb 0.1.2 at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1674&release_id=13538
and try to make s10sh working with this updated library.
I'll try. If you is able to fix s10sh or to make it working
using modified libusb version please drop me a mail!
thanks for your effort,
regars,
antirez
