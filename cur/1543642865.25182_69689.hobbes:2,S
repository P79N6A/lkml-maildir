while at it, could we also finaly drop the broken CMOS clock 
update "feature" from arch/*/kenrel/time.c?
It was already mentioned a few times on this list and iirc there 
was never any argument against removing it.
In short the code does nothing that couldn't be done much better 
from userspace, it implements policy that belongs into userspace
and wastes time in an interrupt handler.
At least one architecture has it already completely disabled.
