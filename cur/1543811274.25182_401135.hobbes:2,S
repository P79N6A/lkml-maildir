If you have an argument for why we shouldn't halt on failed
init{rd,ramfs} decompression, I look forward to hearing it.

"The firmware then calls the kernel decompressor, which dutifully
decompresses the image, and calls the kernel. This image ends up
getting corrupted at some point."
Is your argument that we shouldn't halt after encountering a corrupt

In my mind, being unable to decompress init* is every bit as fatal as
being unable to mount root.
