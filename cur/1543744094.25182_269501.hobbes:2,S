[PATCH] I2C: Check for unregistered adapter in i2c_del_adapter
The patch adds a check at the beginning of i2c_del_adapter in case
someone attempts to remove an adapter that was never added in the first
place. This sounds like a good safety, as doing so will lead to an oops
at the moment. Also, I have a need for it in the latest version of my
i2c-amd756-s4882 patch. I need to remove the original adapter and
install the virtual ones instead, but I have no way to know if the
original adapter was succesfully added beforehand or not.
