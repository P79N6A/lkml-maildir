I was talking about the UTS/leapsecond bits w/ Ted just the other day
and had a similar thought! To me it makes quite a bit of sense to
generate UTC and UTS from TAI, just as you do in the above, since UTC =
TAI + leapsecond offset, just as local time = GMT + timezone offset.
However the difficulty would be that while NTP provides leapsecond +/-
notifiers, it doesn't provide the absolute UTC offset from TAI. So there
isn't a way for the kernel to generate TAI, from a UTC settimeofday
call. Some method to distribute and inform the kernel of the absolute
leapsecond offset (tai_minus_utc in your code above) would be necessary.
Additionally creating UTS and UTC at the same time would be a bit
complicated. Your solution above isn't quite UTS, since it only handles
the leap insertion, however the insertion case is the one that causes
users most of the pain (since the clock goes backward), so it may very
well be good enough.
Overall, I like your idea quite a bit. Might we look forward to a
patch? :)
Roman: you're thoughts?
thanks
