The D-Link DFE530TX NIC, which is based on the VIA Rhine-II chip,
doesn't seem to work properly when receiving data fast. Sending isn't a
problem.

eth0: VIA VT6102 Rhine-II at 0xd400, 00:50:ba:f1:b5:d3, IRQ 10.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 8, status 0x7829 advertising 01e1 Link

when doing 'wget 
http://a-computer-on-the-same-hub/abt-1MB-file
 -O /dev/null'
I get the following on 2.4.0-test11 (and propably with all the other 
test-kernels):
---
Nov 21 15:37:02 FOO kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Nov 21 15:37:02 FOO kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status 0000, 
                            PHY status 782d, resetting...

and then it starts looping until something like 'ifconfig eth0 down;
sleep 10; ifconfig eth0 up; route add default gw ...' is done. 
in beetween the first message and the ifconfig-stuff, network is
completely unusable, which is quite annoying I don't happen to be on the
console.
the very same thing appears on 2.2 kernels with the becker's module from 
http://www.scyld.com/network/via-rhine.html,
 but without the
NETDEV_WATCHDOG-stuff.
