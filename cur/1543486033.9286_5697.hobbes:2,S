Time should be an integer, not a struct. It ought to fit into a
register on a 64-bit machine. If an API needs a struct, let libc
convert as needed. The kernel should use a fast & simple format.
(that is, a 64-bit integer type should last past 2038)
Considering formats already in common use, we could count from 1601
in units of 100 ns. That might seem odd, but 1601 is the last 400-year
mark on the modern calendar.

Call it linux_time_value() just to remind everyone that the
standard API is implemented in libc.

Do you _really_ need to kill the old executables? Couldn't you just
emulate the old system calls?
