I think it's ok in this case, we're unlikely to see these peripherals
on other chips than PMC-Sierra's - but that's of course just a guess.
With a broader perspective the embedded world is increasingly converging
to using standardized components (so called "IP") and on-chip
interconnects such as OCP for new designs and portable drivers should
reflect this.
