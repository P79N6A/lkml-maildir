My understanding of the usage of get_free_page there is as follows:
The problem was that sizeof(struct tty_struct) was very close to
the page size of x86 machines (4K), and kmalloc wasted space
unnecessarily.  Therefore get_free_page was used by x86 to allocate
this structure.  I think I'm right in saying that allocating
anything larger than half your page size is best done with
get_free_page.
Someone will probably correct me on that comment above though.
Can someone confirm please: is it safe and reasonable to use
kmalloc on allocating tty_struct on all architectures now?
