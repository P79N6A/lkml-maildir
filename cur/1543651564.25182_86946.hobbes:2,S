Hmm, you still need 2+#pids operations, while my approach could
essentially do everything in a single read. Besides, many people
don't exactly love ioctls.
Furthermore, you'd need to version your big struct pid_info,
while my approach wouldn't have problems if fields are added or
removed (only if their content changes).
Two advantages of your approach are that the amount of data
cached in the kernel is limited to max(sizeof(pid_t)*#pids,
sizeof(struct pid_info)), and that you do less work under
tasklist_lock.

Hmm yes, so he might not like my /proc/grab-taskdata-FAST
either :)
