However, the reply you got was completely irrelevant; he didn't answer
your question at all (even though he probably thought.)
The answer to your question is that a ramdisk lives directly in the
block cache and does not have to be copied.
You may want to consider migrating to a ramfs or tmpfs, which lives
directly in the *page* cache and therefore reduces overhead further.
