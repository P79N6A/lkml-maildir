Whoa, thanks for explaining that to me -- I didn't know, obviously. I had
just written a test program that used "Ir" with an automatic variable
defined in the inline function (as is the case with these bitops) and
observed that even when I gave > 32 values, it would still work -- hence
my conclusion.
However, the patch still stands, does it not? [ I will modify the
changelog, obviously. ] The thing is that we don't want to limit
@nr to <= 31 in the first place, or am I wrong again? :-)
Thanks,
Satyam
