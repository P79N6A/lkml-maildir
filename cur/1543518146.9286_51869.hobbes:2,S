99% of it can be RAM (there is a PCI window in physical space). Intel's
'Profusion' chipset (used in most 8-way boxes) handles up to 32GB RAM.
[real 32GB RAM] Obviously you can install less RAM than the maximum.
Individual server boxes might have other limitations. (mostly space
related, 32GB RAM takes _lots_ of space)
