Great! Thanks for digging this up - it works on my T42, using a Fujitsu
MHT2080AH drive:
  lenz@metis:~/work/ibm_hdaps> sudo ./headpark /dev/hda
  head parked
Judging from the sound the drive makes, this is the same operation that
the windows tool performs.
However, the head does not remain parked for a very long time,
especially if there is a lot of disk activity going on (I tested it by
running a "find /" in parallel). The head parks, but leaves the park
position immediately afterwards again. I guess now we need to find a way
to "nail" the head into the parking position for some time - otherwise
it may already be on its way back to the platter before the laptop hits
the ground...
Thanks again - this is another helpful bit in getting all the pieces
together.
Bye,
	LenZ
