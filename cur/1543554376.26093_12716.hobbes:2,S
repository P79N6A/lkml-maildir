and you don't get the "RTNL: assertion failed at
devinet.c(775):inetdev_event" in 2.4.x ?
the thing is I need to prevent Tx/Rx when a topology change is initiated
from the ioctl (registering a virtual adapter is just one example), so they
all share a single lock and I must use spin_lock_bh from the ioctl.

Can't you just do this:
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,3,0) /* not sure about the 0 */
#define rtnl_LOCK()	rtnl_lock()
#define rtnl_UNLOCK()	rtnl_unlock()
#else
#define rtnl_LOCK()	/* nop */
#define rtnl_UNLOCK()	/* nop */
#endif
rtnl_LOCK();
register_netdevice(...);
rtnl_UNLOCK();
that works for me (yes, from do_ioctl, but without the bh lock - I
don't know if that's absolutely needed in your case).
