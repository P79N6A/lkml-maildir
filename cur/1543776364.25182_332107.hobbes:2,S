Hi Greg,
	I was getting oopses in kset_find_obj when calling device_find in
2.6.11.12.  Noone else in the kernel uses device_find, but I couldnt'
see anything wrong with it (mind you, I can't understand the
kset_find_obj code to judge it).
	Iterating manually using bus_for_each_dev works though.
Known problem?
Rusty.
