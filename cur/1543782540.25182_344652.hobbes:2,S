Ooops! Missed that. But I agree with the point.

Just a question here. With s_lock held by the remount code, we're
altering the struct super_block, and believing we're safe. We try to
acquire it inside the resize functions, because we're trying to modify 
this same data. Thus, if we rely on another lock, aren't we probably 
messing  up something ? (for example, both group_extend and remount code 
potentially modify s_flags field. If we ioctl and remount at the same time, 
each one with a different lock, something could go wrong). Am I missing
something here ?
