Greetings all,
Core-iSCSI-tools v3.5 has been released:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/storage/iscsi/core-iscsi-tools-v3.5.tar.bz2
The core-iscsi-dv.sh domain validation script has been released at:
http://www.linux-iscsi.org/index.php/Core-iscsi-dv
Note that this script is primarly oriented for iSCSI vendors and
developers for testing data IO using a CLI program accepting a block
device as an arguement.  This tool will be run a pre-calculated number
of times each time negotiating a different set of RFC-3720 parameter
keys until the configuration space has been exhausted.
Currently, v1.0 uses a simple dd_read() to read a few sectors from the
iSCSI CHANNEL+LUN blockdevice that is passed as arguements into the
script.  This script can be easily modified for new script routines that
call any of the large number of available data integrity tools.  Futher
integration of publically available test tools is something that will be
ongoing for the core-iscsi-dv project.
For limitations, warnings and general usage please refer to README:
http://www.linux-iscsi.org/files/core-iscsi-dv/README
Thanks,
