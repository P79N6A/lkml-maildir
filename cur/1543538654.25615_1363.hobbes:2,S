No.  You are not wrong.  This is pretty simple.  Since the MFT is
updated real time in W2K, the journal contents are pretty much
irrelevant for Linux -- the MFT WILL BE THE MOST RECENT COPY.  In the
situation you describe, unless they boot under W2K before booting under
Linux, the journal will get recovered.  If you simply wipe the journal
file when Linux boots, chkdsk will drop into a more agressive mode the
next time W2K mounts the volume and consistency check the MFT (which is
probably better than trying to recover from an out-of-sync journal). 
The safest way would be to always wipe this file if Linux mounts the
volume, and implement our own JFS variant for NTFS as a simple journal
file on the volume (and update the MFT real time and use a background
process to rollout the journal entries as they do) -- but make certain
you set some bits somewhere so you know when not to trust your journal
since W2K may have booted on the volume and got the MFT out of sync with
your journal file -- or always zero the NTFS default journal entry, and
if you ever see that W2K has been booted (and rebuilt this MFT entry)
you know that your journal may be out of sync.  This way, the next time
W2K mounts the volume, it will see that the journal file is missing and
consistency check the entire MFT.  It will make booting on W2K slower,
but since it takes so long for W2K to boot anyway, most MS customers may
not notice :-).
