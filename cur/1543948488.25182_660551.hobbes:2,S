Well we still need to check for the freelist being empty otherwise the 
counter for remote frees does not work as intended. The check was 
introduced at the time when page->end did not yet exist. At that time the 
NULL check made sense.

Subject: Fix check for remote frees
The check for remote frees must check is_end() instead of != NULL.
We execute the !is_end() section rarely so move the check in there. Just do it
once by relying on tail being 1 only the first time we enter the loop.
