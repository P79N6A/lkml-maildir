Track it down yourself:
1) The sizes of your two 'vmlinux' files: do they differ wildly as well?
2a) If no, check the make logs between the vmlinux link line and bzImage
    creation.  Compare the two and note any significant differences.
2b) If yes, write a perl script to compute symbol sizes from each
    System.map file.  (Symbol size == address of next symbol minus
    address of this symbol.)  Sort numerically, then compare old vs new
    for symbols that have grown a lot, or large new symbols.
