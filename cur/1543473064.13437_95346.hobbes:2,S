Hi Alan.
I recently obtained an old Toshiba T2110 laptop, which I have now
installed RedHat Linux 5.2 on, then upgraded the kernel with
kernel*-2.0.36-1.i386.rpm from updates.redhat.com. The spec is
486dx4/75 with 12M of RAM. Here's the output from 'fdisk -l' on it: 
Disk /dev/hda: 32 heads, 63 sectors, 787 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2016 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start      End   Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1             1      305   307408+   b  Win95 FAT32
/dev/hda2   *       306      316    11088   83  Linux native
/dev/hda3           317      367    51408   82  Linux swap
/dev/hda4           368      787   423360   83  Linux native
The first partition is the existing FAT32 partition, successfully
shrunk with fips from RH 5.2. Kernel 2.0.36 appears not to be able to
access FAT32 partitions, so it's not included in /etc/fstab as a
result. Is this correct?
Of the other partitions, /dev/hda2 is mounted on /boot and /dev/hda4
on / with everything else in it. Because the drive is so small, I
havenae installed XFree86 - and for what I plan on using the laptop
for, that isnae really needed anyway...
The 'monitor' on it is a 640x480x256-grayscale LCD panel, and this is
where I became curious: On boot-up in 'vga=ask' mode, LILO indicates
that there are SIX separate video modes available, being 80x25, 80x50,
80x43, 80x28, 80x34 and 80x60, all of which can be selected from LILO
and the display is correctly set into each of those modes, then the
kernel starts booting.
However, part way through the boot-up sequence, the kernel switches
the display back into 80x25 mode for some reason...
What I would like to know is whether it's possible to change this
behaviour? Also, if so, how?
Best wishes from Riley.
