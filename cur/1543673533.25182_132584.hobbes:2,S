What's a "typical client"?
I have machines that typically have 0 pags and tokens in kernel, and I
have machines that typically have a few hundred to a thousand.
Per pag on most clients will only have a single token, but number of
pags will depend totally on the nature of the machine. 
I also have machines that have a few hundred pags around that don't have
any tokens in them, but could at any time.
