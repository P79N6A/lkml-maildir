The swapper_inode only say "I am a swap cache page". Also the
PG_swap_cache bitflag say the same. So we could remove the swapper inode 
even now but that's not a maojor issue.
The swapper inode only deals with the swap cache and the swap cache is not
the right place where to allocate the loop cache.
