It didn't help. Still the same BUGs(). Moreover: it seems that every

In fact I discovered it accidently. I have loaded irlan instead of ircomm
when trying to firnd the reason why connect() on /dev/ircomm0 gives my "No
route to host" every time (with no success) although discivery succeeds.
I'll give it a try without the preempt patch.
