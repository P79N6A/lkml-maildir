Hi,
here the results of Ingo's  lowlatency-test6-pre2-D1 patch:
to mention that I had to remove these two lines in
/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c:
      if (!spin_is_locked(&kbd_controller_lock))
              BUG();
 
because the kernel paniced at boottime
Anyway except a few outliers , the results look good and similar to the 2.2.x
kernels.
But as you can see the disk copy and disk read tests are missing, because
do_rtc_tests hung after the write test. (but the machine did not crash)

comments ?
(BTW: I used the rtc tests because I had unresolved symbol problems when loading
kernel modules (including the sound modules) but that could be my own fault
too)
Benno.
