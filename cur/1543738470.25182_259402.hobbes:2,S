I'd suggest adding:
reparent_domain(domain, new_parent_domain);
When I said that the domains tree is standing on its leaves I meant
that the core components are the CPUs. Or the Nodes, if you already
have them. Or some supernodes, if you already have them. In a "normal"
filesystem you have the root directory, create subdirectories and
create files in them. Here you already have the files but not the
structure (or the simplest possible structure).
Anyhow, the 4 command API can well be the guts of the directory
operations API which I proposed.

Erich
