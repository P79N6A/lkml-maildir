It describes the driver ... I think the problem would be that
the IRQ registration API seems to have changed requirements.
Those labels were never previously treated as anything other
than a way to make /proc/interrupts more meaningful.  The
only request_irq() parameter that "must be globally unique"
is the final "void *dev_id".
