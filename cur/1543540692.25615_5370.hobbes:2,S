Not true!  Have you *read* Canada's export regulations?  Crypto software
*is* covered, and indeed the rules are generally similar to the US ones...
except that there is a blanket exemption for "public domain" software,
plus a footnote saying that copyright protection does not negate this. 
Canada has been a popular base for crypto stuff partly because of the
public-domain exemption, and partly because the Canadian government has
generally been more sensible about *applying* the export rules for non-PD
crypto.  But most certainly there are restrictions.
