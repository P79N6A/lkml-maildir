OK...  So we have
	* potentially faulty mcdx (2.4, apparently either driver corrupts
memory in some conditions or isofs does the same for some IO failures -
need to take a look at that report more carefully).
	* cdu31a (FUBAR driver, nasty to fix, "most of the time" works on
2.6)
	* sbpcd (at least two, both untested with 2.6)

	Is anybody willing to fix those drivers?  'Cause I'm _not_ taking
sbpcd.c, thank you very much - I've played with it for a while, but this
sucker is a testing nightmare.  It is a bunch of drivers for different
models mostly ifdefed together.  Take problems with Becker's netdev drivers,
multiply by plenty and add the fact that while Becker definitely knows C,
sbpcd author doesn't.  floppy.c is cleaner than that beast; come to think
of that, so are toilets on most of the bus stations.
	cdu31a, BTW, still uses cli(), schedules under queue lock and uses
timers in very interesting way.  And that's just from the first look...
