In the data sheet in section 5.15.2.3 it describes a value of map.mv of
1 as meaning that the SATA controller is emulating the logical secondary
channel, and the PATA channel will be the primary.  For a value of
map.mv == 2, we have the SATA controller being primary, and the PATA
is secondary.  So, if I'm understanding the way ata_piix does mapping, 
it seems like for a value of 2, we should have [p0, p2, ide, ide] and 
for a value of 1 we should have [ide, ide, p0, p2] - although for ICH8M 
it seems like 1 should not be a valid value. My reading the ICH8 spec is 
that ICH8M only implements a map value of 2, and 1 should be reserved 
(see section 12.1.33).
