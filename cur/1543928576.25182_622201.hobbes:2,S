Table 143 suggest to me that legacy interrupts should be routed to all cpus,
which certainly doesn't seem to be the case in this situation.  Perhaps Nvidia
goofed on that part of the specification?

Certainly, this seems like the best solution long term.
So I'm looking at the implementation for 64 bit system, and it seems a little
cleaner than 32 bit setup.  I'm wondering if we can just call setup_IO_APIC
immediately after init_IRQ in start_kernel?  Could it be that straightforward?
