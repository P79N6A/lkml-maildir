I experience the same with OnStream DI30 - but these errors occure in 2.2.17 as
well. In my oppinion they show up in fewer cases with 2.4-test10. 
The error is not quite"stable" because it occures on different tape positions
(filenames) when I retension the tape three aor four times befor writing to it.
I checked the tapes on a Windows machine and they seem to be o.k..
