Hi all
I got bitten by this problem on sparc64 (a blade 1000)
  
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297474
summary :
  modprobe bbc
runs kenvctrld which uses 100% of a CPU for 5 seconds,
then 0% for 5 seconds, then 100% .. and so on. The author
cited above suggests removing the line 
  remove_wait_queue(&bp->wq, &wait);
in the function 
  static int wait_for_pin(struct bbc_i2c_bus *bp, u8 *status)
Is there a better way?
I can test patches if that would be helpful.
Cheers
Jim
