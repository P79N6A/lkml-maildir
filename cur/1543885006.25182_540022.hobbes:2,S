In 32-bit mode?  Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!
In protected mode, you *must* have different descriptor values for the
code segment as opposed to the data segments, at least if you ever want
to write anything to the data segments!
What's worse, reloading segments here might be highly unsafe, if the
memory previously occupied by the GDT has been overwritten.  Keep in
mind the GDT is touched on a segment *load*, not on a segment *access*;
in areas such as booting that can be a huge difference.
