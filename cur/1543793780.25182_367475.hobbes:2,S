If you try the chdir by filedescriptor trick on the stdin/stdout/stderr fed 
into PID 1 when it's started up by the kernel, which filesystem do you wind 
up in?  (rootfs?)
I ask because switch_root redoes those to point to /dev/console from the real 
root (presumably for security reasons), and this happens _before_ the init on 
the real root gets called, and thus before the real root gets to populate 
its' own dynamic /dev.
I suppose initramfs could make a temporary /dev, do the mknods for console and 
the real root, and then mount --move this tmpdir to the real root's /dev once 
that's available (and then let the real root's udev populate it the rest of 
the way).  Or the real root could have a hard /dev/console living in the 
directory that's going to get overmounted by tmpfs later.  Or just leave 
initramfs accessible until init can switch consoles...
Sigh.  I need to document the requirements here...
