Hija,
I'm trying to spawn new threads from a function called from alloc_uid
using daemonize () as soon as a new user appears on the system. Somehow 
this detaches the original shell from the tty causing an exit not
only of the child but also it's parent.
A diagram of the situation would lock like this:
getty -> (login of root) bash -> (su to another user) bash ->
[new thread is spawned] (whatever) -> exit -> getty
Alternativly, when directly logging in a non-root user:
getty -> (login of foo) motd -> [hang]
How can I daemonize something without disturbing other processes?
I already tried playing with reparent_to_init and some signal stuff
as done by other parts of the kernel but to no avail.
