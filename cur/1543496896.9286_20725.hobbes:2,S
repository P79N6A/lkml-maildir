Is it is sufficient to make the 
lookup inode operation et al. and the hash and compare 
dcache operations case insensetive to make a foolproof
race-free, kernel-panic free case-insensetive filesystem?
Just a quick answer please. This is for an assignment
so *no* detailed solutions. A 'yes' would be nice.
CC any replies to me please...
While I have your attention, I have a few one-liners:
A debug version of linux that would allow you to force
  unload a module with registered devices etc and not
  have the whole system fall to pieces.
Can you change the permissions of files in /proc without
  patching and recompiling? (BTW, IMHO it's annoying that
  ipchains -L only works for root. Seems wrong)
Where can I find the latest proposel for fixing module
  versioning?
Is there any way to make DevFS nice?
Are the dancing makefiles going to become standard?
What's the web page for them?
Is the /proc/config.gz patch going to become standard?
And where can I download it?
Any help would be appreciated...
