There's one important bit missing from that graph, the 
2.6.23-SCHED_BATCH values. Without that we can't tell how much 
improvement is from sched-devel and how much from SCHED_BATCH. Clearly 
2.6.23 is better than 2.6.22.any in this test, the locking issues seem 
to dominate that difference to the point that nothing else would be 
informative.
This weekend I have to do some building of kernels for various machines, 
so I intend to run some builds SCHED_BATCH and some will just run. If I 
find anything interesting I'll report.
