otoh, all the sys parameters are in /proc/sys as well. i guess cpuinfo was
left out in the cold because its typically read-only ? but still, its not
like sysctl and proc are completely orthogonal..
DESCRIPTION
       The  _sysctl  call  reads and/or writes kernel parameters.
       For example, the hostname, or the maximum number  of  open
       files.
$ ls -l /proc/sys/kernel
total 0
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            0 Jul  7 11:17 domainname
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            0 Jul  7 11:17 file-max
-r--r--r--   1 root     root            0 Jul  7 11:17 file-nr
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            0 Jul  7 11:17 hostname
