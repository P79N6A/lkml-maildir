All I'm saying is that I know for a fact that some BIOS's will do this
(set bus speed to 100) if they detect problems - I know mine does.
It's just one possibility. I don't actually /know/ what causes what you
experienced.
I guess it's possible that something the kernel did caused the BIOS to
think there was a problem even though there was not...
Or it could be something else entirely.
I don't know for sure. All I can do is suggest that maybe you should check
your motherboard manual for any hints on this behaviour and maybe try and
test your hardware just to be safe...
Other people probably have better advice for you.
