Hello,
I have been working on Linux 2.4.20 for a couple of months and use a Davicom 
Semiconductor Ethernet network card driver known as dmfe.c for module dmfe.
I had no problem since here, but on Linux 2.6.0-i386-stable kernel is 
refusing to load the module :
--
$ insmod dmfe.o
insmod: error inserting 'dmfe.o': -1 Invalid module format
$ lspci | grep Davicom
00:0a.0 Ethernet controller : Davicom Semiconductor, Inc. Ethernet 100/10 
Mbit (rev 31)
--
I tried to load the module by various ways : with old (for 2.4.20) and new 
(from 2.6.0 stable) compiled driver, but that didn't work. I quickly looked 
at the source code which seems quite old. I can't actually help you in 
having a deeper workaround because I don't yet have sufficient technical 
skills for that.
I'm working on a Debian Sarge testing prerelease.
Have fun in debug ;p
Regards,
Thadeum.
