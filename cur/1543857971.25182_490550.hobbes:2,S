No. We don't do this. We don't add TOTAL CRAP to the kernel just because 
somebody is being an idiot in user space.
This is definitely a user space bug. It was a serious bug before, it just 
wasn't obvious.
The thing is, if anybody runs SLES, they expect support. That's what the 
"E" in "Enterprise" means.
So I would suggest SLES now show that support by fixing THEIR BUG.
