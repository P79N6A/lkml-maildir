(no offense intended) :-)
If you look at my post more closely, you'll see I used `kB' (that's small
k and capital B) for decimal kilobyte. I would never suggest using `KB'
(that's capital K and capital B) for it. I do agree that `KB' is traditionally
used for binary kilobytes, but what about MB, GB and so on? These _are_
ambiguous. I am in favour of using Ki, Mi and Gi for binary quantities.
