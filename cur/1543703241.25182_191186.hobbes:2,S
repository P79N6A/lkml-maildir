There are only 3, UHCI, OHCI, and EHCI.  You can forget about EHCI, as
all EHCI controllers contain either a UHCI or OHCI controller embedded
in them (EHCI only handles the USB2 high speed data.)  So you really
only have to handle 2.

Sorry, this is correct.  Unless you want to take over the whole pci
device that the USB controller is on.  That's a possiblity you might
want to look into.
