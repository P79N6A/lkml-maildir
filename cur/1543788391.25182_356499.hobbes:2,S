Please just use the existing dev_dbg() and friend functions instead of
creating your own.

This should be static, right?

Please just delete this whole section, no new ioctls for 2.6 please.

Return type on the same line as the function name please.

count0 doesn't really need to be here, does it?
What if you get passed less than that size of data?  You will be reading
in off of the end of the buffer (which is not a nice thing to do...)

Not needed, just drop this #ifdef please.

Odd indentation here.  You do this a lot, please fix them all.

Again, please drop all of the #ifdefs from this file, they are not
needed.

We have kzalloc() now.

Indentation is wrong.

Try this instead:
	ret = misc_register(&tlclk_miscdev);
	if (ret) {

Try registering a whole attribute group instead.  It's much nicer than
the 20 lines you have to register and unregister your devices (and you
don't handle the error condition properly if something goes wrong half
way through.)

Why not just put this stuff into the tlclk.c file itself, as it isn't
needed anywhere else?
thanks,
