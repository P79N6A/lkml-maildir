From a FreeBSD man page at
http://dorifer.heim3.tu-clausthal.de/cgi-bin/man/madvise.2.html
     MADV_DONTNEED    Allows the VM system to decrease the in-memory priority
                      of pages in the specified range.  Additionally future
                      references to this address range will incur a page
                      fault.
     MADV_FREE        Gives the VM system the freedom to free pages, and tells
                      the system that information in the specified page range
                      is no longer important.  This is an efficient way of al-
                      lowing malloc(3) to free pages anywhere in the address
                      space, while keeping the address space valid.  The next
                      time that the page is referenced, the page might be de-
                      mand zeroed, or might contain the data that was there
                      before the MADV_FREE call.  References made to that ad-
                      dress space range will not make the VM system page the
                      information back in from backing store until the page is
                      modified again.
