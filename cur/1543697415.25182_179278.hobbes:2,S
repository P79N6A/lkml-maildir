I, too, am the owner of a 'centrino' laptop, which comes with the intel Pro/
wireless 2100 card. At the time I bought it, Intel said that they would be 
providing linux support for centrino, and since they made good on their 
claims in the past, I went ahead and bought it. Unfortunately, until now, 
they haven't substansiated that claim yet. And, I'm not really willing to 
cough up another 150-200 EUR for another minipci card, which - in some cases 
- - even has to be of a specific type to work with the bios of the system!
So, driverloader or ndiswrapper provides me with a workable solution, even 
though it's not really the way I like it. But it works. That's what counts 
for the majority of the 'desktop/laptop' linux users. They don't care how it 
happens, as long as it happens.
Personally I'm only half in that camp, since I like to use opensource & free 
drivers/software if available, and will advocate the use of such software. If 
no decent os substitutes are available, I'll use proprietary/binary only 
stuff nevertheless.
