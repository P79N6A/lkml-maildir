Your description makes it sound like the device has disconnection disabled in
the SCSI BIOS (the CTRL-A message at boot up BIOS area).  If that's the case,
enabling disconnection on the CD-RW device should solve your problem.  If
that's not the case, then I suspect the mid layer SCSI code since the aic7xxx
driver in 2.4.0-test3 (5.2.1, which is nothing more than a forward port of
5.1.31 from the 2.2.x kernel series) should be the same as the aic7xxx driver
in 2.2.17pre (5.1.31).
