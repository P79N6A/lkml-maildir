I don't know if you have read my latest post regarding this. anyway here it
is :)
It was the PCI latency value that was wrong. It was set to 0 in the BIOS so
I have changed it now to 64. I now get the following figures! :) BTW I'm
running two Western Digital WD800JB-00DUA3 (Special Edition 8 MB cache)
disks connected to a Promise TX2000 (PDC20271) card (RAID1 using ataraid
(pdcraid) drivers).
hdparm:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.12 seconds =114.29 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.53 seconds = 41.83 MB/sec

Wow, slow down for a minute. Most IDE chipset drivers does a excellent job
at autotuning the max *safe settings* for your drive/chipset combination.
Mucking around with hdparm parameters blindfolded will only cause you grief
in form of data loss and system instability sooner than later.
Usually when one gets into performance problems with IDE in Linux, the
chipset specific driver is not enabled, making the system fallback to the
generic driver - OR the drive and controller combination is considered
unsafe with faster settings.
Without any user intervention at all, my Seagate 7200 120G's does 55MB/s in
the infamious hdparm test, on a VIA KT266 based board, both in
2.6.1-rc1 and 2.4.23.
