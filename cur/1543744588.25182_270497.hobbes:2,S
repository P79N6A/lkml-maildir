Full history could be preserved, but I don't think that getting it from the
web interface would be polite, and I can't run bk myself (for obvious
reasons).
I could hack up a sketch of how I'd go about getting the full history.
Crudely speaking, I'd just need a couple of functions: one telling me the
parents of a given version, and one fetching a given version.  And of
course, finding the author/date/comments for each version.  If someone else
were willing to implement those two functions, I could sketch out how the
darcs side of things.  Obviously renames wouldn't be preserved with just
those functions, but that's not a huge loss.  And also, the conversion
process would be painfully slow.
