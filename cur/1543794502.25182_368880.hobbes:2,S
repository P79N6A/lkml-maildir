I would suggest using git-bisect to find the problem - I do know that
the problem was/is in Linus Torvalds tree. It was fine around 2.6.13
timeframe and broke sometime after this. I find git-bisect very
powerful for testing these types of bugs.
I was going to test myself in this way but the machine which
experienced the problem caught fire!! I know this sounds like the dog
ate my homework but unfortunately it was true and it was a machine I
borrowed too....
