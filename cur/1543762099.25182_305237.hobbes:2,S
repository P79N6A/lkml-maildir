Earlier I reported that Matthew's acpiphp rewrite had problem in 
powering down slot on my i386 system.  The following patch is 
needed to get the acpiphp rewrite properly powering down the slot.
A similar patch was sent out to Matthew for comment and Rajesh 
had tested the patch on Tiger4.
I just did a test of Rajesh's latest patch on 2.6.11.5 with
Wilcox's acpiphp rewrite and the following patch.  Hot-plug of 
PCI Express card worked fine on my i386 system
Thanks,
Dely
