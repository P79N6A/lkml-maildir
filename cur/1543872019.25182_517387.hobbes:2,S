Subject: [PATCH] [scsi]: Add offline state checking while dispatch a scsi cmd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/8/64

While a scsi device hw error occured, device's status maybe setting 
to SDEV_OFFLINE, So at scsi_dispatch_cmd function, we should checking
if device have offline, if yes, do nothing and just return error to
user directly.
