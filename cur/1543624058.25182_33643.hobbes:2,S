Off the shelf, I've had relatively few problems with my Supermicro P6DCE+. 
Aside from not supporting higher than 12 physical IDE devices (6 masters), 
being mostly ACPI-driven, requiring some odd-ball 24-pin+8-pin+4-pin 
power supply, and having a terrible board layout, I'm very 
impressed with this motherboard and its features. I haven't experienced a 
single lockup with the board, and it's been running in production using 
2.4.19-pre2-ac2 now for 3 days without a hitch. Hyperthreading is enabled. 
It's a dual 2.0GHz machine, and easily the fastest PC-based machine I've 
ever used. It's got its quirks, which you'll see in practice, but aside 
from them, i'd highly reccommend this motherboard.
hope this helps...
