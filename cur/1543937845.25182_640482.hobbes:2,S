I really like this patch :-)! Just a little note, why don't make 
the parameter 'char *reason' as simple integer (reason_t)? 
Making it as integer will automatically drop the strncmp() 
and speeding up all the things. Could be also interesting to 
define _externally_ the mapping of the reason so the 
userspace tool could handle it easily.
