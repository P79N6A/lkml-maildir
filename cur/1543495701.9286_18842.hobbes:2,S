Ok, IIRC I posted a similiar post a while ago, but now I have further
info.
I have two of the above mentioned cards, running just fine under any
2.2.x when run in UP mode. When I switch to SMP, it compiles, but fails
to boot. It now gets all the way up to where it should either laod the
noduels (when compiled as modules), or run the card. At this point I get
a root panic; unabel to mount yadda-yadda. This is due to it not
'loading the drivers' in either case. Any ideas? It is sooo annoying to
not be able to use both of the cpus ...
