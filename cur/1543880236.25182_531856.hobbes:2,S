nothing wrong with asking for clarification.  Though you should have
copied linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org.

With the introduction of file capabilities in -mm, you can assign
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE to a program not owned by root such that all users
can run the program with that capabilities.
Even in mainline, you can make the program setuid 0 and code it such
that it immediately specify keepcaps, change to nonroot, and drop all
caps but CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE.

Look at the prctl(2) manpage - it is about keeping capabilities across
setuid, not across exec.

Are you aware of the namespace/containers work going on right now to get
full virtual server support into mainline?  See
http://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/
for the archives of the main relevant mailing list.

Please see the file capabilities support in -mm and let us know whether
that does (not) meet your needs.
