I've been using vanilla 2.4.1 with no problems, with my soundcard (SB PCI 128 / es1370) sharing IRQ with the USB-controller (this is an Abit KT7-RAID motherboard).
This is what /proc/interrupts tells me:
           CPU0
  0:     130808          XT-PIC  timer
  1:        564          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  7:      12256          XT-PIC  usb-uhci, usb-uhci, es1370
 10:        503          XT-PIC  eth0
 11:       2916          XT-PIC  ide2, ide3
 14:         16          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:         11          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0
ERR:          0
After upgrading to 2.4.2-pre3 I get sound corruption (I believe this problem has existed since pre2, since I suspect the " - driver sync up with Alan" part of the changes in pre2 to be the source of the problem. I've also tried 2.4.1-ac9, which gives me the exact same problems (sound corruption, really "weird" sound).
Hope this is enough info to at least track down some problem if it hasn't been done already.
I'm not subscribed to the linux kernel mailing-list, so please CC to me any follow-ups and I'll do my best to track down the problem if more info about my system/configuration is needed.
Best regards,
