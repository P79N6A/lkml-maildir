need_resched == 1 means you _have_ to reschedule ASAP careless about the
scheduler algorithm at all.

If honouring the need_resched bit is decreasing performances than it means
you _want_ to change the scheduler and not the code that honour the
need_resched bit. Of course I am supposing the checks itself are not the
source of the slowdown.
