You are absolutely correct. Those tests are very weak, and (as I tried to
explain in my original mail), I did not intend the patch to be merged as
it was. I only did those (admittedly very weak) checks initially to be
able to easily verify with a test program that my checks where indeed
checking the right fields of the ELF header, and that introducing
aditional checking did not make the kernel "blow up".
I'm working on a proper patch that'll do the real checks of these ELF
header fields, as well as add additional checks.
I'll be submitting that patch as soon as it's done. I'm aiming to have
something ready during the weekend.

I plan to.
I just wanted to get some feedback initially. The patch was a very minor
bit of the email I send, and probably the least important bit.
I wanted to get peoples reactions to the thought of adding stronger sanity
checks. The patch was just a minor thing - the discussion about "do we
want additional checks?" was the important bit.

I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.
