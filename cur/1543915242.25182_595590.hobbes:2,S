I can confirm that the problem is fixed for me too in current git when
using the free avivo driver (with the binary only fglrx driver the
machine just hangs on resume or even sometimes on sleep). So it might be
worth to purposely keep that such that people transit from fglrx to the
free avivo/radeonhd drivers. Anyway s2ram with avivo takes 2-3 sec to
suspend and 4-5 for resume (when fglrx worked it was more in the 10-20
secs).
