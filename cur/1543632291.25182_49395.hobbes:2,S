the code right now, will pass all the errors through to the user
space in any case (beside a handful internal kernel-functions).
by changing unsigned long to void * everything should stay the same
(at least for todays architectures) - well if i'm wrong, please
enlighten me :)
also using IS_ERR is essentially the same as the other approaches
to check for errors (beside the check for == 0).
this means by "cleaning up" the internal functions, _nothing_ should
me impacted, even if the changes are step by step, function by function,
beside some gcc warnings (the well known: "assignment makes pointer from
integer without a cast").
cheers,
