If you take spin_lock in interrupt as well as in process context then-:
1. On UP non-preempt kernel: There will be no locks taken, so nothing
is gonna protect the shared data between the interrupt handler &
process context thread.
2. On the UP preempt kernel: The lock has been taken by the process
context, and now if the interrupts is issued, it will try to grab the
same lock, but it will never get it ... and nobody is going to leave
that lock. boom* - Deadlock.
3. On SMP machine non-preempt kernel: The locks will be taken but no
protection against the interrupt as such.
4. On SMP preempt kernel: process context threads are synchronised but
not the interrupts.

Yes, AFAIK the correct idea is to take spin_lock() in interrupt
handler (Here I consider that your interrupt is already disabled.)
And take spin_lock_irq() or spin_lock_irqsave() lock from the process
context.
