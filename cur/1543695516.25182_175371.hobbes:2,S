Well, so could udev in theory, and I had this plan to enhance it to do
so for the specific case of multipathing one day in the not too distant
future (ie, before q1/04).
In as far as I can see, udev and uSDE really do not have too different
goals. Competition is good, but only if they explore distinct approaches
;-)

Yes, I know that, I was asking whether you had done any discussion with
the EVMS2 folks for example to have a policy plugin to interact with
EVMS2 accordingly and do the magic.
