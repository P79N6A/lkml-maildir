It's bogus.  Mel, I didn't take a close enough look when we were talking
about it earlier, and I fear I led you astray.  I misunderstood what it
was trying to do, and though that the zone_populated() check replaced
the highest_zone() check, when they actually do completely different
things.
highest_zone(zone_nr) actually means, given these "zone_bits" (which is
actually a set of __GFP_XXXX flags), what is the highest zone number
that we could possibly use to satisfy an allocation with those __GFP
flags.
We can't just get rid of it.  If we do, we might put a highmem zone in
the fallback list for a normal zone.  Badness.
So, Mel, I have couple of patches that I put together that the two
copies of build_zonelists(), and move some of build_zonelists() itself
down into build_zonelists_node(), including the highest_zone() call.
They're no good to you by themselves.  But, I think we can make a little
function to go into the loop in build_zonelists_node().  The new
function would ask, "can this zone be used to satisfy this GFP mask?"
We'd start the loop at the absolutely highest-numbered zone.  I think
that's a decently clean way to do what you want with the reclaim zone.  
In the process of investigating this, I noticed that Andy's nice
calculation and comment for GFP_ZONETYPES went away.  Might be nice to
put it back, just so we know how '5' got there:

Mel, you might also want to take a look at what Linus is suggesting
there.
