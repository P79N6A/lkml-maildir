We have a bug database pretty close to being ready be shipped.  It's a 
somewhat "unique" approach, we figured out how to coax a BK repository
into looking like a database and added a layer so you can spit pseudo
SQL queries at the repository and get bug reports.  You can play with 
it at 
http://bitkeeper.bkbits.net/bugs.html
 which is actually our
live bug database so don't close bugs unless you fixed them :)
Part of the point of doing it as a BK repository was that you could
take your bugdb with you and link bugs to changesets as you create
the changesets.  If people do that, the release notes which list the
set of bugs closed by that release can be generated with a one line
command, which is a big part of what people want.
For those people who'd rather roll their own than use ours, the linkage
is done through the use of "changeset keys" which are the underlying name
for revisions.  You can dig those out with a
	"bk prs -r<rev> -nd:KEY: ChangeSet"
and there is a key2rev command which will convert them back if you like.
We can easily import any format so long as we can get at the data so if
a bugdb emerges which has the data and people no longer want to maintain
it, we'll do the import.  
Regardless of what database is used, we can provide a machine, net
connection, etc.  I think the person who did that page mentioned that
their ISP wouldn't let them host it.  If you want a kbugs.bkbits.net or
some other name, let me know, I'll get someone to set it up.  It won't
be the biggest machine in the world, probably a 400Mhz bookpc, but the
bugdb would be the only thing on it so it might be enough.  If it's not,
we'll revisit the issue.
