Hi Stephen,
> Hopefully, with Martin's continued blessing, here is the s390x part.
Looks fine to me. I can't test it at the moment because the s390x compat
stuff is broken right now. Not because of your patches but other things
need fixing. I'll have a go at it as soon as I'm through with the TLS
stuff for binutils and glibc. Keep up with it, I'm happy about every
line of code that is moved out of the arch/s390* folders.
