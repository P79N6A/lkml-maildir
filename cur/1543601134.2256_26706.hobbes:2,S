Sure ?
I think it is 497 days, jiffies is "unsigned long" on IA32.
(On PPC "HZ" is 1024, but i think there "jiffies" is 64-bit.)
I encountered this problem as my "/proc/uptime"-counter got over the
ridge and the machine now has an uptime of 550 days, but /proc/uptime
speaks of 550-497=53 days.
I also postet a patch against this effect, but this does only cosmetic
and no major changes to other things like "jiffies".
If you move HZ to 1000, this moves to 24.855 days, and the

The rollover at my machine (2.2.10) did not do any harm, but that does
not mean that there will be no negative side-effect.
Solong..

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
