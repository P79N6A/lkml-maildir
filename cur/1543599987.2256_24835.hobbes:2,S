Attached is a patch to usb-storage.  Linus, please apply.
This patch adds 3 configuration sub-options to the usb-storage driver.  One
is _very_ well tested -- that's CONFIG_USB_STOR_ISD200.  The other two are
still experimental, but there are many people using it, so I think it's
time it's on the menu (at least as EXPERIMENTAL).
