Not quite.  As you pointed out:

The drive *knows* which sectors are bad -- it's mostly all in the S.M.A.R.T.
logs and such.  Which smartctl already knows how to read.
So now we just need a script-kiddie to do a nice little awk script for you,
which extracts the bad sectors info from the output of smartctl, and then
feeds this as input to badblocks.
