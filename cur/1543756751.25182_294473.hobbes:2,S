Maybe because I'm a little sick and tired of all the "BK is evil" crap
without any accompanying "thank your all the good it's done"?  
If every time someone sent you a bug report on your open source software
it started with "this software sucks, and you're a pinko anti-capitalist

it any way because yours is The One True Way (tm).
