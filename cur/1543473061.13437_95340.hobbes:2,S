Hmmm ... If we remove the first sentence that claims FFS does the right
thing but EXT2 does not, this sounds right in theory.  AFAIK, common UNIX
O/Ses donnot guarantee File System objects fine IO ordering. Just allowing
synchronous vs asynchonous writes is very poor and everything should be
handled synchronously by the FS in order to really guarantee consistency.
This obviously would break performances dramatically. 
At SCSI IO level, it is possible to ask the device server for ordering 
requirement when providing it with severall IOs. A tagged command can 
be queued with SIMPLE_TAG, ORDERED_TAG, HEAD_TAG. This allow the device  
firmware to optimize its caching strategy without breaking user wanted 
ordering of actual IO operations.
If we imagine some ideal O/S that provides equivalent ordering services 
for its cache handling and that will ensure physical ordering matches 
the cache ordering by using appropriate ordering tags at physical IO 
level, then it would be possible to implement an EXT2 FS that does the 
right thing, as well as any other File System by the way.
