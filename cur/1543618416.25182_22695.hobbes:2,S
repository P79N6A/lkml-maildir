Do not forget to run 'sync' after you dismount it.

My non-hotpluggable bay first disconnect power, and it works fine,
every friday evening for more than two years... But I have this
device alone on its cable, so there is no traffic when I disconnect it.
And I probably lost warranty by doing that.

Unless something changed behind my back, do not do it. As kernel
have no idea that you removed drive, it will not invalidate its
caches. Maybe you could workaround this (at least you have to ask
it to rescan partition table), but I decided to not plug IDE HDD into
machine when kernel runs. So I reboot my system on each Monday morning, 
and I plug hdd in when BIOS checks memory. It resets your uptime to zero,
but as I upgrade kernel much more often, it is not a big problem.
Only problem I had were ATAPI devices. There is stupid paragraph about
creating `virtual' slave when none is present, in the ATAPI standard,
and so even if you plug HDD into the box as a slave to ATAPI device,
you'll not see it until you powercycle your ATAPI device... At least
my Chineese CDROM behaves that way, so I put it on its own cable.
