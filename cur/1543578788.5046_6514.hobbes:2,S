In my opinion (rt)netlink would benefit a lot from introducing 5-10 new
errnos and possibly a new socket option to get a string/number with the exact 
error.
Configuring a complex subsystem like CBQ which has dozens of parameters
with only a single ed'esque error message (EINVAL) when something goes
wrong is just bad.
