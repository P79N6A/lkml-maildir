Ouch.  
I suspect we are going to see more of this, as USB drive for backups
is probably a very attractive option for many.
The 'obvious' solution would be to count dirty pages per backing_dev
and rate limit writes based on this.
But counting pages can be expensive.  I wonder if there might be some
way to throttle the required writes without doing too much counting.
Could we watch when the backing_dev is congested and use that?
e.g.
 When Dirty+Writeback is between max_dirty/2 and max_dirty,
  balance_dirty_pages waits until mapping->backing_dev_info
    is not congested.
That might slow things down, but it is hard to know if it would slow
things down the right amount...
Given that large machines are likely to have lots of different
backing_devs, maybe counting all the dirty pages per backing_dev
wouldn't be too expensive?
