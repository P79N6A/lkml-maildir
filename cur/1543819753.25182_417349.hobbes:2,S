yes, noticed it 10 secs after I posted.   Fixed.

Clearly a better comment is necessary.
There are a set of filesystem types for which we don't believe pathbased
mediation is relevant.   Obviously for a system which is inode based mediating
these filesystems makes more sense.  I'm unsure if it is fragile. Clearly
the set could grow, if this is what you mean, then yes, a less "fragile" way
of determining these would be useful.

Ok. Thanks. I'll look at it.

We're not duplicating.  aa_audit is just a common datastructure where AA
event information is stored.  It is passed to aa_audit which logs it to
the kernel audit subsystem.  It facilitates a single point of logging.
If you think this can be improved (clearly another case for better commenting)
I'd be curious to hear your views.

This is where the issue of the namespace_sem rears it's ugly head.
The issue isn't the namespace sem, it's the lack of vfsmount information 
passed to LSM from the VFS,  It facilitates the need for this function.  
The change in visibility of the per namespace semaphore in the shared 
subtree changes just makes it a little bit worse.
