This isn't a brown paper bag bug, but I'll throw it out to the interested
parties anyway.  This occurs in 2.2.1:
smc-ultra               4044   1 (autoclean)
8390                    6244   0 (autoclean) [smc-ultra]
ipx                    12284   0 (autoclean)
nls_iso8859-1           2020   1 (autoclean)
nls_cp437               3548   1 (autoclean)
vfat                   11644   1 (autoclean)
fat                    25408   1 (autoclean) [vfat]
awe_wave              157772   0 [smc-ultra]
sb                     32468   2
uart401                 5968   2 [sb]
sound                  57208   0 [awe_wave sb uart401]
soundlow                 300   0 [sound]
soundcore               2340   5 [sb sound]
Is it just me, or should awe_wave and smc-ultra be completely unrelated?
Also, I can't get the AWE wavetable detected, despite following the
instructions to the letter, and no driver conflicts (all IO and IRQ's
free, isapnp appears to initialize the card correctly).
