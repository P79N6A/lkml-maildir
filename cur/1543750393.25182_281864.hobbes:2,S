Ok. That's a good piece of information. 
I don't actually understand why do_syscall_trace() does that 
TIF_SINGLESTEP test in the first place, since the ptrace_notify() should 
happen as part of the _normal_ TIF_SINGLESTEP handling, afaiks. No 
apparent need to do it in syscall tracing, and do_syscall_trace() does 
that bogus fake signal sending.
Hmm.. That TF_SINGLESTEP test was added by Davide Libenzi in August, and I
think Davide had some test for exactly this. Davide? Can you recall why
you did this in the system call tracing code, rather than depend on the
regular TIF_SINGLESTEP handling in arch/i386/kernel/signal.c:
do_notify_resume()?
(Jesse's patch re-appended here in-line for Davide's "reading pleasure").
That still leaves the problem of the clearing of TF_MASK. I _appears_ that 
the problem is that TF was set both by Wine doing a PTRACE_SINGLESTEP 
(since PT_DTRACE is set) _and_ the application having TF enabled in eflags 
from before (since it seems to want to keep it enabled).
How about something like the attachment for the TF_MASK issue (replacing
your "don't clear" code)? The comments should make the intention pretty
obvious, but I have equally obviously not actually _tested_ any of this..
