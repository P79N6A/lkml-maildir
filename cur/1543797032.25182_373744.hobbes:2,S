Greetings!
Current aic79xxx driver doesn't see SCSI devices larger, then 2TB. It 
fails with READ CAPACITY(16) command. As far as I can understand, we 
already have LBD support in kernel for some time now. So it's only the 
drivers, that need to be fixed? LSI driver is the only one I found 
working with devices over 2TB; I couldn't test any other driver, as I 
don't have the hardware. Is it really so bad, that only LSI chipset and 
maybe few others are capable of seeng such devices?
My kernel output with aic79xxx follows:
