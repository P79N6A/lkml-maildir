Hello all,
    Everytime I compile the 2.6.5 Linux kernel I get these warning messages:
  AS	arch/i386/boot/setup.o
/usr/src/linux-2.6.5/arch/i386/boot/setup.S: Assembler messages:
/usr/src/linux-2.6.5/arch/i386/boot/setup.S:159: Warning: value 0x37ffffff truncated to 0x37ffffff
    What does it mean?
Thanks in advance.
