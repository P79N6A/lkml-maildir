I describe the problem again:
- efi_ioremap on 64bit returns a fixmap address:
void __iomem * __init efi_ioremap(unsigned long phys_addr, unsigned long
size)
{
       ...
        return (void __iomem *)__fix_to_virt(FIX_EFI_IO_MAP_FIRST_PAGE -
                                             (pages_mapped - pages));
}
- __fix_to_virt is:
 (FIXADDR_TOP - ((x) << PAGE_SHIFT)) and x is a small integer <30 or so.
- Fixmap is
#define VSYSCALL_END (-2UL << 20)
#define FIXADDR_TOP (VSYSCALL_END-PAGE_SIZE)
that gives e.g. 0xffffffdfffff for the top fixmap; the efi fixmap
is only slightly pages below.
- You pass that into set_memory_uc()
- That eventually calls __pa() on it several times
(in static_protections and in change_page_attr_addr for 64bit to
check for the kernel mapping)
- __pa calls __phys_addr which does
unsigned long __phys_addr(unsigned long x)
{
        if (x >= __START_KERNEL_map)
                return x - __START_KERNEL_map + phys_base;
        return x - PAGE_OFFSET;
}
- Now __START_KERNEL_map is 0xffffffff80000000.
- That ends up with
x = 0xffffffdfffff - smallnumber*PAGE_SIZE
if (x >= 0xffffffff80000000)    (evaluates to true)
	return x - 0xffffffff80000000 + phys_addr
- This ends up with some fictional number in cpa (but likely one
looking like a valid pa address) that has nothing
to do with the address that is mapped below the fixmap
- cpa() does weird things to random unrelated memory then or
might clear rw if you're really unlucky.
- I think on 32bit with a real ioremap it's also not completely kosher
with the right __PAGE_OFFSET (but I have not double checked
that step by step)
This is why I avoided calling set_memory_uc for the fixmap
and instead changed the code to set the correct PAT
attribute into the fixmap directly to avoid this.
I believe the full original change or some Thomasized variant of it
is still needed.
