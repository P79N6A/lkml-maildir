I got a problem report on the handling of large (2.4GB) files
with isofs, where 2.6 was fine and 2.4 failed. Replied

and got the confirmation that that solves the problems.
Maybe one should consider adding this in 2.4.
No, I have not audited the source. If in fact there is
a reason why files this size are not handled correctly,
there should probably be an assignment with the largest
value that is handled correctly, together with a comment.
