Yes, those are the reason why I have some aggressive asserts in the code
to try track down the problem. Try this:
http://mmlinux.sourceforge.net/public/patch-2.6.20-rc2-rt2.1.lock_stat.patch
It's got some cosmestic clean up in it to make it more Linux-ish instead
of me trying to reinvent some kind of Smalltalk system in the kernel. I'm
trying to address all of Ingo's complaints about the code so it's still a
work in progress, namely the style issues (I'd like help/suggestions on
that) and assert conventions.
It might the case that the lock isn't know to the lock stats code yet.
It's got some technical overlap with lockdep in that a lock might not be
known yet and is causing a crashing.
Try that patch and report back to me what happens.
