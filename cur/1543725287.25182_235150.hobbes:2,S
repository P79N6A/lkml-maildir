Subject: Resume failing in get_cmos_time()

On around 20% of ACPI resume attempts, the resume hangs during
time_resume(). I've traced this down to the get_cmos_time() call - a
printk before that appears, one afterwards doesn't. The rest of the
time, resume works correctly. Interestingly, this only seems to happen
if I use the patch from 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2643
or a similar one for the IO-APIC. Does anyone have any idea why this
might result in this sort of failure mode? I'm considering just removing
the call for now and resetting the clock from userspace.
