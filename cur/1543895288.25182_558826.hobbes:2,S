Because I CC new people, let me summarize:
2.6.18 works fine. Most kernels after that print
"agpgart: Detected an Intel 965G Chipset."
and then either hang (I have to hard reset them), hard
reset by themselves or print one or two more lines mostly
related to hardcrashes (memory page faults or otherwise)
and hang then. This can vary from boot to boot even
with the same kernel.
Some kernels don't hang. They never hang - they always work.
Kernels that work do NOT print "agpgart: Detected an Intel
965G Chipset." (All I know is that I have an ASUS P5B motherboard
with a iP965, whether it's this 'G' or not I don't know).
This is the regression that 'git bisect' comes with:

    mm: Fix memory/cpu hotplug section mismatch and oops.
    When building with memory hotplug enabled and cpu hotplug disabled, we
    end up with the following section mismatch:
    WARNING: mm/built-in.o(.text+0x4e58): Section mismatch: reference to
    .init.text: (between 'free_area_init_node' and '__build_all_zonelists')
    This happens as a result of:
            -> free_area_init_node()
              -> free_area_init_core()
                -> zone_pcp_init() <-- all __meminit up to this point
                  -> zone_batchsize() <-- marked as __cpuinit   fo
    This happens because CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n sets __cpuinit to __init, but
    CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y unsets __meminit.
    Changing zone_batchsize() to __devinit fixes this.
    __devinit is the only thing that is common between CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y and
    CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y. In the long run, perhaps this should be moved to
    another section identifier completely. Without this, memory hot-add
    of offline nodes (via hotadd_new_pgdat()) will oops if CPU hotplug is
    not also enabled.

==================
If you want my opinion on this: git bisect is broken :p
I was very surprised that it printed this at this point.
One bisect before, it said there were still 96 revision to check.
Anyway - here are some facts of the kernels that I tested:

idea what to do next to find this problem.
