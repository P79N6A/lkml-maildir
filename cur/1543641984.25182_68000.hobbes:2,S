I am seeing some strangeness here.  When running 2.4.18 NFS mounting 
FROM Solaris 2.7 using '/net -hosts' to get the Solaris /net/<hostname> 
mounting, it seems that it requires CONFIG_NFS_V3 to do the 
/net/<hostname> mount, even if the mount takes place using NFSV2.  NFSV2 
/net/<hostname> mounts from a Linux server works fine.  Manually 
mounting from Solaris 2.7 using the 'mount' command also works fine with 
NFSV2.  It only seems that the amd '/net -hosts' is broken because 
Solaris is only talking TCP/IP during the initial mount request.
Is this a kernel or amd issue?
