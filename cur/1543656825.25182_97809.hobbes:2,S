   Here's another patch to use kmalloc_percpu.  As usual, this removes
   NR_CPUS bloat, can work when modulized and helps node local allocation.
I can't consider this seriously until the kmalloc_percpu stuff
actually makes it into Linus's tree.  Last I checked, Andrew had
a lot of legitimate gripes with the ideas.
