Subject: USB bug in 2.3.12
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

When trying to compile 2.3.12 with USB as modules I get the following error.  I
had the same problem with 2.3.11 but didn't get around to reporting it.
I have put my .config file in 
http://www.coker.com.au/~russell/2.3.12.config
 .
ohci-hcd.c:312: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type

What's the best way for me to report a bug to this list and reduce the chance
that I'm reporting something someone else has already reported?  I don't want
to waste anyone's time...
