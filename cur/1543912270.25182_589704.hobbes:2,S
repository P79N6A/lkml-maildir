Subject: [PATCH] snd_hda_intel for F/S T4210
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi folks,
the patch below, to be applied to sound/pci/hda/patch_sigmatel.c fixes the audio
output on the Fujiutsu/Siemens lifebook T4210 (and probably on others). It is
suitable for the kernel 2.6.23-rc4 (and probably others).
Without the patch, audio fails and the hda driver fails to load with
No available DAC for pin 0x0
However, the indicated pin has no connections in first place and thus should be ignored.
With the patch applied audio output works fine.
Here's the patch:
