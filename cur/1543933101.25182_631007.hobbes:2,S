There is no BUG on this line on 2.6.24-rc5.   Since there are many
BUG_ONs in this file it is unclear which you mean.
Could you always include the version of the kernel where the actual
oops in the line came from?
Anyways there are a lot of third party modules who do strange 
things with c_p_a(), not always legal, so you might look up out for that 
pattern too. Perhaps report the out of tree modules loaded in the 
summary too?
