Needless to say, I'm now very satisfied with the new readahead code.  
That's not to say there won't be corner cases where the old code did
better, but given the replacement's simplicity and Fengguang's positive
benchmark results I really like it.
Thanks for Fengguang for coding and pushing this!
Rusty.
