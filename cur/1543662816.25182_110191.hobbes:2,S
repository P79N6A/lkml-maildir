I finally got around to applying early printk, and I found out that the 
system does indeed get to startup_32().  As it turns out this was simply 
related to a CONFIG problem.  I built-in INPUT (instead of using it as a 
module), and the virtual console CONFIG was then made available.  (NOTE: 
I didn't think to check the input subsystem config, because the last 
time I mistakenly disabled input -- because I simply used "make 
oldconfig" which didn't enable CONFIG_INPUT -- the only thing it 
disabled was the keyboard and mouse).  Why does CONFIG_INPUT affect the 
console?
