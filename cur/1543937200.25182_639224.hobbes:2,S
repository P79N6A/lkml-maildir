I applied the patch and I am still locking up after
Time: hpet clocksource has been installed.
I rebooted with "clocksource=tsc" to get the logs of the trace which
was added. I'm assuming the grep below gets all the interesting parts.
I enabled the HPET character device as mentioned before, which is why
the hpet0 lines appear now.

I ran a 'sleep 1', which hung as expected when I installed hpet as the
clocksource via /sys. I dumped the sysrq trace showing where it was
hung:
