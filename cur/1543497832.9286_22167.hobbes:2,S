All,
I'm cc'ing this to Volker Lendecke as a courtesy, although I do not
believe he has been active as a maintainer for some time.
Under 2.2.9 + hjl/gam knfsd patches + tronds v3 patches, smbfs is
completely hosed.  All I have to do is mount a share from NT4/SP4 and
attempt to write data to a file (or delete a file).  The Linux process
will hang irrevocably in 'D' state and cannot be killed.  The mount point
remains busy, and cannot be umounted by any means.  The only recovery is a
reboot.  The file does get created at zero-length (or deleted) on the NT
box, FWIW.
I reverted back to 2.2.7-ac2, and all's fine.  
Steve
