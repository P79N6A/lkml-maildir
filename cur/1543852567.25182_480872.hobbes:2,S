Your application is feeding crap to the kernel, because of programming 
bugs. If that happens, I want an EFAULT and not a partially filled buffer. 
And which buffer then? This could have been scribbled in userspace memory 
(the pointer), and the try of the kernel to mask out bugs might create 
even more subtle problems. Such bug will *never* show up in the up in case 
the wrong buffer is partially valid (first part, that is the *only* case 
where your fix would make a difference compared to the status quo), since 
in case of no ready events we'll never hit it, and in case of some events 
we'll always return few of them and never EFAULT. No, the more I think 
about it, the more I personally disagree with the change.

Ohh, if you think you can measure them from userspace, those can be turned 
in 'err |= __put_user();' with err tested only out of the loop.
