Maybe git-fsck-objects should have an option to make it note dangling 
objects of certain types, and then count these as reachable? (That is, you 
want the head of an unreachable chain listed for recovery, but not other 
things reachable from it; you also may want the list of blobs and trees 
not reachable either from a ref or from something listed for recovery, but 
not omitting a blob reachable only from an unreachable tree)
