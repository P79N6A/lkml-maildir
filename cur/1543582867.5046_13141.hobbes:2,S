Wrong.
Cache and processes are INCLUSIVE. Konquerer and your other
applications will share a lot of memory with the cache. More
precisely, everything which is backed by a file or has been
swapped out once (and swapped back in later) will SHARE memory
with both cache and processes.
In 2.4.1-pre<something> the kernel swaps out cache 32 times more
agressively than it scans pages in processes. Until we find a way
to auto-balance these things, expect them to be wrong for at least
some workloads ;(
