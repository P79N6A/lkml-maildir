Well, I'd say yes, certainly, and I'll support the effort ... but the
problem is that I'm not one of the powers that be who control our
current bugzilla ... that's the constituency we need to convince.  As I
keep saying, just getting new SCSI bug reports tipped onto the SCSI
mailing list will give us about 90% of what we need, but I haven't even
managed to get that to happen.
