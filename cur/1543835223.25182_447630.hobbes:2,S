I must defer to Ingo, Thomas, and Steve Rostedt on what the right thing
to do is here, but I do much appreciate the pointers!
If I understand what you are getting at, this is what I would need to
do to in order to have a synchronize_rcu() priority-boost RCU readers?
Or is this what I need to legitimately priority-boost RCU readers in
any case (for example, to properly account for other boosting and
deboosting that might happen while the RCU reader is priority boosted)?
Here are the RCU priority-boost situations I see:
1.	"Out of nowhere" RCU-reader priority boost.  This is what
	the patch I submitted was intended to cover.  If I need your
	prio_booster struct in this case, then I would need to put
	one in the task structure, right?
	Would another be needed to handle a second boost?  My guess
	is that the first could be reused.
2.	RCU reader boosting a lock holder.  This ends up being a
	combination of #1 (because the act of blocking on a lock implies
	an "out of nowhere" priority boost) and normal lock boosting.
3.	A call_rcu() or synchronize_rcu() boosting all readers.  I am
	not sure we really need this, but in case we do...  One would
	need an additional prio_booster for each task to be boosted,
	right?  This would seem to require an additional prio_booster
	struct in each task structure.
Or am I off the mark here?

This does sound a bit scary.  What exactly am I adding that would motivate
inverting the lock ordering?
