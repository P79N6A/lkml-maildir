Yes, and it also avoids the CPU cost of copying data around, so there's
a double performance win there.

The block device interface is layered underneath the buffer cache, but
it can be used independently if you fake the buffer_heads.  That's what
the VM does when swapping or when populating the page cache, for
example, and the Linux raw character device patches do the same for
block IO.
