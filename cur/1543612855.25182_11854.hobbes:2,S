The 'current'.  In this case 2.5.0.  This work was mostly
interested in changing data structure layout and algorithms
used to make scheduling decisions.  We still wanted to make
the same decision, just more efficiently when faced with
a high rate of scheduling decisions or large number of runnable
tasks.  Like I said earlier, this design constraint was
both good and bad.

I assume the queue a task is assigned to is based on its priority?
Or am I way off.  Are there 8 ranges of priorities for runnable tasks?
Just curious how you came up with 8.  We also dabbled with a scheduler
that had queues based on task priority.  One issue was that we couldn't
seem to come up with an optimal number of queues to represent all task
priorities.
