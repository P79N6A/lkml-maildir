Yes, exactly.

I must admit, I am not brave enough to even think about this
now :)
I already thought about protecting ->parent with task_lock(),
but I can't find a reasonable solution.
As for handle_stop_signal(), there is another problem.
do_notify_parent_cldstop takes ->parent's sighand->siglock, so
the caller drops child's. And this is possible only because we
are holding tasklist_lock.
Somehow we need to lock both the parent and the child, and what
if child does ptrace on it's ->real_parent?
Oleg.
