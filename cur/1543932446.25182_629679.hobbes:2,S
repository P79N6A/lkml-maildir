Subject: [PATCH 5/9] tmpfs: allocate on read when stacked
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/18/303

tmpfs is expected to limit the memory used (unless mounted with nr_blocks=0
or size=0).  But if a stacked filesystem such as unionfs gets pages from a
sparse tmpfs file by reading holes, and then writes to them, it can easily
exceed any such limit at present.
So suppress the SGP_READ "don't allocate page" ZERO_PAGE optimization when
reading for the kernel (a KERNEL_DS check, ugh, sorry about that).  Indeed,
pessimistically mark such pages as dirty, so they cannot get reclaimed and
unaccounted by mistake.  The venerable shmem_recalc_inode code (originally
to account for the reclaim of clean pages) suffices to get the accounting
right when swappages are dropped in favour of more uptodate filepages.
This also fixes the NULL shmem_swp_entry BUG or oops in shmem_writepage,
caused by unionfs writing to a very sparse tmpfs file: to minimize memory
allocation in swapout, tmpfs requires the swap vector be allocated upfront,
which wasn't always happening in this stacked case.
