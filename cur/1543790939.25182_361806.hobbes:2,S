This has me worried because it is putting yet another dependency on
cached attributes in the VFS.
This should normally be OK as far as NFS is concerned since we usually
end up revalidating the attribute cache in the lookup() code, but you
could imagine a networked filesystem that does not do this. I'd
therefore prefer if such checks were made in the filesystem itself.
What we can, however, do is to ensure that truncate() and ftruncate()
only set ATTR_SIZE, but ensure that may_open() sets ATTR_MTIME|
ATTR_CTIME as well.
Cheers,
