How about something like:
#include <linux/timer.h>
void queue_task(void process_timeout(void), unsigned long timeout,
struct timer_list *timer, unsigned long data)
{
	unsigned long expire = timeout + jiffies;
	init_timer(&timer);
	timer->expires = expire;
	timer->data = data;
	timer->function = process_timeout;
	add_timer(&timer);
}
You will have to define the "struct timer_list timer".  This should
cause the function passed to be called after "timeout" jiffies (1/HZ,
not to be confused with 10 ms).  If you want to stop the timer early do:
	del_timer_sync(&timer);
"data" was not used in you example, but process_timeout will be passed
"data" when it is called.  This routine is called as part of the timer
interrupt, so it must be fast and should not do schedule() calls.  It
could queue a tasklet, however, to relax constraints a bit.
