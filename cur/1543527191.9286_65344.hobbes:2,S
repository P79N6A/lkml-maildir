Sure, but a background search job like slocate should be perfectly happy
if it simply starts getting IO errors while scanning recursively down a
suddenly-removed media.  That's the clean behaviour --- the media was
removed, and any further access to the removed filesystem results in a
clean EIO return to the application.

No.  In a multi-user O/S, such media/drive failures have to be handled
automatically.  There really isn't scope for much in the way of user
interaction for two reasons.  First, if you just buffer dirty data until
the user happens to restore the disk, then you are wide open to
denial-of-service attack as the user has effectively pinned a large
amount of dirty data in memory.  Secondly, the user may accidentally
remove a disk early (while data is still being written) and just walk
away.  The O/S has to recover -- that user may not be back for a week.

What has locking to do with it?  We are specifically talking about
drives which cannot do proper door locking.  (Supermount already deals
cleanly with drives whose door locking is reliable.)

Because the floppy can be ejected before the user does a umount.  Just
prompting for it to be reinserted is inadequate, for the reasons above.
