Maybe I have a similar problem. ESS Maestro 2E, OSS maestro.o driver, 
kernel 2.4.18 (and all versions since 2.4.0), Toshiba 4100XCDt laptop. 
However, here first the sound becomes somehow distorted and a few 
minutes later the machine just powers off. For me, it looks like a 
hardware failure because the same problem was visible when I got the 
machine with WinNT preinstalled.
Could you please tell me if sound is distorted before the "hangs"? In 
that case, try pausing the output and then continue playing. The 
distortion should disappear and you should be safe from hangs until the 
next distortion period.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
