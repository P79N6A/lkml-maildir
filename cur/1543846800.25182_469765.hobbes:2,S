Ugh.  I just tested this with a grub 0.97-5 from what I assume is a
standard FC5 install (I haven't touched it) and the kernel boots.
I only have a 64bit user space on that machine so init doesn't
start but I get the rest of the kernel messages.
There were several testers working at redhat so a pure redhat
incompatibility would be a surprise.
I don't think the formula is a simple grub+bzImage == death.
There is something more subtle going on here.  
I'm not certain where to start looking.  Andrew it might help if we
could get the dying binary just in case some weird compile or
processing problem caused insanely unlikely things like the multiboot
binary to show up in your grub install.  I don't think that is it,
but it should allow us to rule out that possibility.
