But it doesn't mix different descriptors on the same selector; the GDT 
is initialized when the CPU is brought up, and is unchanged from then 
on.  The PDA descriptor is GDT entry 27 and the userspace TLS entries 
are 6-8, so in the typical case %gs will alternate between 0x33 and 0xd8 
as it enters and leaves the kernel.
My test program does the same thing, except using GDT entries 6 and 7 
(selectors 0x33 and 0x3b).
