Nope, good point :)  The system experiencing the allocation failures is
using an rtl8169 gigabit NIC (at 1gbps), the 2.6.26.3 system is on a
100M connection with a gigabit Broadcom BCM5721 / tg3.
02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.
RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller (rev 01)
04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5721
Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express (rev 11)
I can see how this could account for different behavior, although
presumably both drivers are calling __netdev_alloc_skb.
Cheers,
Dan
