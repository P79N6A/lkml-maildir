OK, sounds good - I might be twisting it with the SMP code, which I'm much
more familiar with.

Well it should be. Except that someone did this for some odd reason
#define hard_smp_processor_id()                 0
on non-SMP rather than non-local-apic.
But we could just substitute the real code:
static __inline int hard_smp_processor_id(void)
{
        /* we don't want to mark this access volatile - bad code generation
*/
        return GET_APIC_ID(*(unsigned long *)(APIC_BASE+APIC_ID));
}
which is in smp.h, but wrapped in #ifdef CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC.
All very twisted. Probably not worth it.

Absolutely ;-)
