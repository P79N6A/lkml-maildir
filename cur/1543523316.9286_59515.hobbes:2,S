Hi,
Now that Davide has posted version 1 of his patch for 2.2.14 can we get some figures?
Lets find out if his patch, in its current form O(n log n), costs in real terms.  I have
posted some numbers in the thread with the patch.  They seem to imply things are faster
with only 4 (or less) runnable tasks.  If this is typical, there is no real need to 
add code for the current behavior to the patch...
What do the numbers say?  These are what count.
