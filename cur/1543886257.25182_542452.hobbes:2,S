Suspend-resume, eh?
There's an immediate suspect. Can you test this specifically for us?
i.e. download a known good file set, do some stuff, suspend, resume,
then check the files? If it doesn't show up the first time, can
you do it a few times just to rule it out?
If suspend/resume does cause the problem, can you try again but this
time please run 'xfs_freeze -f <mtpt>' on the filesystem before
suspend, and then 'xfs_freeze -u <mtpt>' after the resume and see if
the problem still occurs?
Cheers,
Dave.
