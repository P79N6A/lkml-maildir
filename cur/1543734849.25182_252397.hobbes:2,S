Subject: [RFT 2.6.9-rc1 alpha sys_sio.c] [2/2] convert pci_find_device to pci_get_device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I submitted these patches to PLM on linux-2.6.8. It automatically runs
compiles for several architectures, including 'alpha'.
   
http://www.osdl.org/plm-cgi/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=3315
The alpha filter does a 'defconfig' build, and it had 2 warnings, 0
errors.
Unfortunately, the 2.6.9-rc1 has a few errors for the 'defconfig' build,
which is why I did not apply it there.
