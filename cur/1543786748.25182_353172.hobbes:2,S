I'm having the same problem with 2.6.13, AMD64 X2, Asus A8V Deluxe 
motherboard. What's worse is that this is my local net's NTP server, so 
it's taking all my other machines' clocks along for the ride, and I'm 
losing my associations to the upper strata servers because the skew gets 
too great. (So ntpd needs to be restarted periodically.)
I've seen earlier reports on this list about the clock running twice 
normal speed. That's not what I'm seeing here; after several hours it's 
only ahead by 5 minutes at the moment. (The system has been up 20 days, 
but I restarted ntpd a few hours ago, and it resync'd via ntpdate at 
that point.) Maybe it would be running at 2X if I kill ntpd, I haven't 
checked that.
If it matters, I configured a 250Hz clock tick on this kernel.
