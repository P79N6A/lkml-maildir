And your insults continue... :-(
I ask a simple question and try to explore alternative solutions and this 
is your contribution to it?
To put this into a little more context, this is the complete text you cut 
off:
| One question here would be, is it really a problem to sleep a little more?
| Another possibility would be to add another sleep function, which uses 
| hrtimer and could also take ktime argument.
So instead of considering this suggestion, you just read what you want out 
of what I wrote and turn everything into an insult. Nicely done, Ingo. :-(
bye, Roman
