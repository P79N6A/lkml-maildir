KPROBE_ENTRY() is the assembly equivalent of __kprobes, it places the
symbol in a special section (.kprobes.text) where probes can't be
inserted. This is usually helpful in cases where inserting the probe may
lead to recursion or other undesirable behaviour.
See include/linux/linkage.h and include/linux/kprobes.h.
