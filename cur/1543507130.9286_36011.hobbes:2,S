Hi again folks,
  I'm not a subscriber to this list so please respond via email if
possible <sims@sugar-land.sl.slb.com>.
More on the problem (which is still not solved -- see below):
  I have now successfully low-level formatted this drive using an
application from Seagate under DOS :-( (nary a bobble and no media
errors with extensive pattern testing)...
  Partitioning was normal, yet when I go to make an ext2 filesystem on
the disk under Linux, it writes about half of the inode tables (107/197)
and then says:
107/197
hdb: dma_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hdb: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: dma_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hdb: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: dma_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hdb: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: DMA disabled
ise0: reset: success
hdb: write_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: write_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
124/197
hdb: write_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: write_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
done
Writing superblocks and.....
  After DMA is disabled (automagically as above) I still get two (2)
hdb: write_intr: .... errors per filesystem creation unless I reboot
(and then it has to go through the DMA disable process.... So it's not
just a DMA issue.... It does this at _about_ the same stage every time
I try to create a filesystem on this drive.... In spite of the errors
and complaining it _does_ seem to successfully build a filessytem
eventually...
I am using kernel 2.2.6 which has the 1.08 IDE disk driver.... Here's what
dmesg looks like for the relevant portion:
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfaf80
PCI: Using configuration type 1
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: 00:38 [1106/0586]: Work around ISA DMA hangs (00)
Activating ISA DMA hang workarounds.
.
.
.
VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x6000-0x6007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x6008-0x600f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL EX6.4A, ATA DISK drive
hdb: TOSHIBA MK6409MAV, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL EX6.4A, 6149MB w/418kB Cache, CHS=784/255/63, UDMA
hdb: TOSHIBA MK6409MAV, 6194MB w/0kB Cache, CHS=789/255/63, (U)DMA
So.... It seems that something is not quite right with this ATA-2 disk/IDE
SiS 5513 controller combination....
But what??? Also, I have tried the latest kernel (2.2.11 and 2.3.15)
[presumably with the latest IDE stuff] with the same result.... also
have manipulated every possible parameter with hdparm to no avail....
The disk in question is a Toshiba MK6409MAV 2.5 inch 6 Gig laptop drive...
It runs fine using W95 and DOS... I am using LBA... my hair is getting
even thinner :) Please provide some additional advice/counsel .... I guess
I can spend another $300 on an IBM drive and see if that solves the problem.
Dave

Hi folks,
  I'm not a subscriber to this list so please respond via email if
possible <sims@sugar-land.sl.slb.com>.
  The problem:
  I have an Aaeon <
http://www.aaeon.com
> PCM-5894/5892 SBC with SiS 5582
(from the chip on the board) chipset... It has an Award BIOS... I am trying
to use it with a Toshiba MK6409MAV 2.5 inch disk drive... It 'sort of'
works but I get lots of errors (many <Busy>) and occasional corruption/
confusion/long delays while reading the drive.... I am running the latest
slackware and Kernel 2.2.6... I am in the process of upgrading the
kernel to 2.2.11 at the moment but decided to send off this note hoping
someone would be able to say 'move foo to bar and all will be well'....
I have been using Linux for a few years now and this is the first time
I have seen anything like this. The problem has been going on for a month
or so now and I am just about fed up so any help would be welcome :)
If I look in /proc/pci I see the following:
PCI devices found:
  Bus  0, device   0, function  0:
    Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems 5597/5598 Host (rev 16).

      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000 [0xe0000000].
The error I am seeing on the console at boot up with the Toshiba
drive is:
hda: drive_cmd: error 0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hda: drive_cmd: status 0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
If I install the Toshiba drive on another PC it seems to run fine....
At this point, any clues are more than welcome. I'm ready to do almost
ANYTHING...
TIA,
Dave
