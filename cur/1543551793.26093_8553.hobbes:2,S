Hi
Please have a look at
http://www.in.tum.de/~rohloff
I put two implementations of twofish on the site
and also a modified loop.c 
(which uses requested sector number as IV and
 fixes another problem with xfer->lock and unlock.)
The first implementation of twofish basically
uses an IV seed which is added to the requested 
sector number to get a per sector IV.
The second implementation encrypts the sector number
with the key to get a per sector IV.
(Look at the source for the exact details.)
The implementation should build without modifying
your linux-kernel source tree, so testing should
be easy.
Please get it and give me some feedback.
so long
  Ingo
PS: The web site is slow :-( but it should work.
