Yes I've seen this four times over maybe three weeks.  Three times on dual
CPU, once on a different UP machine.
In all cases, crond is stuck in a loop calling nanosleep with a tv_sec value
of a bit over 4,000,000 and a tv_nsec value of zero.  nanosleep keeps
returning EINVAL immediately.
I'm not sure why crond is trying to sleep for so long.  Maybe it has set an
alarm.
errr, OK.  This returns -EINVAL:
#include <time.h>
main()
{
	struct timespec req;
	struct timespec rem;
	int ret;
	req.tv_sec = 5000000;
	req.tv_nsec = 0;
	ret = nanosleep(&req, &rem);
	if (ret)
		perror("nanosleep");
}
I shall take a look....
