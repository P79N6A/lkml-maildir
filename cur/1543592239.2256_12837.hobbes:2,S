Greetings, and thank you for this information!  I've just confirmed
this.  Both of my ATAPI tapes don't work reliably with the Promise
Ultra100, but do work with the on board ALI 15x3 chipsets.  Both disks
in this box appear to work with both sets of controllers.  After
considerable difficulty, I'm now booting off of the off-board Promise,
and all looks stable.
Question -- is the lack of support for ATAPI on the Promise Ultra100 a
hardware, or a driver/software, issue?
Take care,
