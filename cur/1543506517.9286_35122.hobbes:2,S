I really don't think this "inversion" of the test makes any sense.
The cacheflush_time value is the time it takes to fully reload
the cache -- something that takes too much overhead if the task
only runs for a very short time.
The way you interpret it here, in contrast to the more narrow
related(p1,p2) condition, looks like you're promoting tasks to
spend a relatively large portion of their time reloading stuff
into the cache, as opposed to doing real work.
It might make more sense to test for (cacheflush_time * 3)
or some other slighly larger value in order to make sure that
we keep the overhead down...
