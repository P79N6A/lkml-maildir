Subject: [patch *] VM deadlock fix

Hi,
I've found and fixed the deadlocks in the new VM. They turned out 
to be single-cpu only bugs, which explains why they didn't crash my
SMP tesnt box ;)
They have to do with the fact that processes schedule away while
holding IO locks after waking up kswapd. At that point kswapd
spends its time spinning on the IO locks and single-cpu systems
will die...
Due to bad connectivity I'm not attaching this patch but have only
put it online on my home page:
http://www.surriel.com/patches/2.4.0-t9p2-vmpatch
(yes, I'm at a conference now ... the worst beating this patch
has had is a full night in 'make bzImage' with mem=8m)
regards,
Rik
