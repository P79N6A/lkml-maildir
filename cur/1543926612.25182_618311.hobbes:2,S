Well, one simple nasty idea would be something like:
diff --git a/fs/Kconfig b/fs/Kconfig
index 429a002..da231fd 100644
--- a/fs/Kconfig
+++ b/fs/Kconfig
@@ -1604,7 +1604,7 @@ config NFS_FS
 
 config NFS_V3
 	bool "Provide NFSv3 client support"
-	depends on NFS_FS
+	depends on NFS_FS && !XFS
 	help
 	  Say Y here if you want your NFS client to be able to speak version
 	  3 of the NFS protocol.
So people who are likely to be affect just side-step the issue until
it's resolved.
