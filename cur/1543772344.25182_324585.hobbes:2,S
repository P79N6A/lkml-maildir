Some of it is lack of displine with how various drivers do locking in
that they overload the meaning of a spin_lock, etc... to also disable
preemption and side effects with preempt_count. Making all of this formal
is a good thing since it clarifies and un-ambiguates those code paths.
It's something that should have been done in the first place and I
consider using implicit masking like that to be rather sloppy.

They obey the same constraints on driver in those nanokernel systems also
apply to the preempt patch. There is no difference other than the regular
driver layers in that they now need to be audited, duh. All RTOSs need to
do this.

LynxOS is a hard real time OS similar to how the preemption patch works
in that it's a single kernel system. It's gets those times regularly and
is obviously deterministic because of careful coding conventions just like
it has always been. Single kernel determinism is not new. It's only new
to you.
