Yes, I did spend quite a lot of time the last time looking for usable
USB APIs, and I did not manage to find any.  Unfortunately, my time is
also limited, and I'd much prefer to work on getting support for
Samsungs ARM CPUs into Linux.  When I'm doing paid work for a customer
and they want to a proprietary driver, I'm not going to spend a lot of
my free time on working around that decision.  I explain to them that
binary drivers are definitely in a grey area and they might get in
trouble about it, but at the end it is their decision.

So in other words you want to crack down on GPL violations, and you're
going to ignore anyone who does have a proprietary driver as "not
relevant" or "it can be done with usbfs" (maybe). So why even ask on
the mailing list?  Just do it.
Saying "use BSD" instead isn't a good answer for me since I don't know
BSD well enough.  And personally, I want to see Linux everywhere; I
think it's a lot better to have Linux + a proprietary driver in an
embedded system than BSD or Windows CE.  It means that the customers
get used to Linux, and if I can get them to at least contribute back a
bit (any improvements to the core kernel for example), to me that is a
lot better than giving a lot more money to BillG.
Later, when I can show them how much easier everything gets if they use
open drivers (I'd never have managed to get my latest Samsung platform
up and running as quickly as I did without the patches I got from
Sandeep Patil, and by posting my patches to his patches I got some
feedback that helped me fix a bunch of bugs).  But it usually takes
some time to convince a company that the things they get back is more
valuable than keeping things proprietary.  So I think Linux as a whole
gains a lot more by being a bit lenient about proprietary drivers.
That is why I'm opposed this change of yours.
