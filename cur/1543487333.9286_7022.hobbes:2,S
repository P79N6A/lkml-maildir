NT is installed in hda1, lilo in hda.
# LILO configuration file
# generated by 'liloconfig'
#
# Start LILO global section
#verbose=3
boot = /dev/hda
#compact        # faster, but won't work on all systems.

timeout = 300
default = linux
vga = normal    # force sane state
linear

  other = /dev/hda1
  label = other
