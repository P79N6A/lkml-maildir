The problem is detecting if or when the latest -mm got created.
If I have to do it by hand, it becomes a major PITA.
I could use RSS to do this, but some patches may still hit the wrong
folder. What's more it would create unnecessary network load.
There are sometimes only a few minutes between "patch in -mm1"
and "patch in -mm2".
