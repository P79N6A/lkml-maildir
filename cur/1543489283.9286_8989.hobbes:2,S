  There have been suggestions of using  mmap() flags to do this, certainly
not quite generally portable approach, but not so bad, either.
(And knowing what local tricks e.g. AIPS does per platform, I would not
 consider such mmap() gimmic bad at all ;-) )
I am curious regarding compilers, is there any way to tell to e.g. egcs
that given memory reference should be done in explicite BE, or explicite
LE mode, and let the compiler to generate proper instructions in order
to do such accesses -- as DaveM noted, such memory-reference-endianity
bit seems to exist in SPARC64 ?
