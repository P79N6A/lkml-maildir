Hmmm, what sources are you compiling exactly?
I last tested with 2.6.12 + 2.6.12-uc0 (uClinux) patches + the v850 patches
I sent to the LKML recently (from which I presume you got the defconfigs);
the v850 patches should now be merged into Linus's tree, but I dunno about
the uClinux patches (and of course there may already be v850 breakage in
Linus's current tree; I usually only test real releases).
If you care to try applying the uClinux patches, they should be available
from (fill in "$ver" with "2.6.12-uc0" and "$maj_ver" with "2.6"):
    
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uClinux-
$maj_ver.x/linux-$ver.patch.gz
Greg, do you have any status on merging the current uClinux patch set?
Thanks,
-Miles
