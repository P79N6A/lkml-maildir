The kernel could be chosen by processor type, if you added a "reboot
into a new kernel" function.
It would be rather large for one initramfs, as _all_ of the modules have
combinations of SMP/non-SMP x i386/486/586/686/athlon/686-PAE versions,
not just the core kernel.
It may still be a useful function for CDROM or network boots though.
I.e. initramfs selects an optimised kernel and set of modules to run,
and replaces the current generic kernel with the optimised one.
