I have the same problem with 2.6.0-t1-ac2. If I minimize a
window, my xmms hangs for a few ms. Same if I browse on some pages and go
back/forward.
The screen/windows also fills/draws a little bit slow. (well,
could be a X/nvidia problem)
I changed back to 2.4.22-p7 and everything works fine.
Regards,
Martin
