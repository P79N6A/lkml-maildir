Thanks a lot for your report Mark. Before we start digging deeply here -- 
Dmitry, do you think that this could be caused by your input-locking 
patches somehow? From Mark's report:
- it didn't happen with 2.6.23
- when drivers/hid is put back into 2.6.23 state, the problem still 
  persists in some sense
So there must have been some change elsewhere (USB, Input, something 
completely different) that introduced this problem.

First it would be really helpful to see if
- the HID driver really obtains two click events from USB stack. This 
  could be easily seen from HID debug output. I have written in previous 
  mail how to obtain this
- the output of evtest for the mouse device in /dev/input/event? (for 
  determinign the correcnt event number corresponding to your mouse, see 
  /proc/bus/input/devices)
