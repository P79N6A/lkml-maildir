When I do a make bzImage I get this problem:
nm vmlinux | grep -v '\(compiled\)\|\(\.o$\)\|\( [aUw]
\)\|\(\.\.ng$\)\|\(LASH[RL]DI\)' | sort > System.map
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.2/arch/i386/boot'
ld -m elf_i386 -Ttext 0x0 -s -oformat binary bbootsect.o -o bbootsect
ld: cannot open binary: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [bbootsect] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.2/arch/i386/boot'
make: *** [bzImage] Error 2
I don't exactly understand what's the problem but it's located at the ld
line, and I can't seem to identify what binary it can't seem to find.
I'm running debian (unstable) system, 2.4.1, Athlon-1Ghz, Asus A7Pro
board, ld version : GNU ld version 2.10.91 (with BFD 2.10.91.0.2)
Any help would be appreciated.  btw, if I just do a regular make, it works
out fine, just that one line seems to be problematic.
