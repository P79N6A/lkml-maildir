Even better so that you do not confuse all telnets to your box, even ones
from machines that do not exhibit this problem try something like this in
your profile:
USER=`whoami`
CURTTY=`tty`
FROMADDR=`last -1 "${FROM}" | grep "${CURTTY}" | awk '{ print $2; }'`
if [ "${FROMADDR}" = "Windows Machine Name" ]; then
    TERM=vt100
    export TERM
fi
This will only force the terminal to be vt100 for logins originating from
whatever machine you specify.  Note: I may have mistaken which field to
print in awk, I think the second field is "from address" but I'm not sure at
the moment.  Just check it by running last before implementing this.
