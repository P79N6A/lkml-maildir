I think if the need is sufficient we can do this: fix it in 2.6.23 and in
2.6.22.x.  That means that there will be a few broken-on-new-glibc kernels
out in the wild, but very few I suspect.

argh.  Nobody told me it was an ABI change!  We'll need to consider merging
make-timerfd-return-a-u64-and-fix-the-__put_user.patch into 2.6.22.x as
well.
