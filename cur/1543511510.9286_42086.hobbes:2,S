Subject: Capability check on ioctl(FIBMAP) seems wrong

Hi,
  I've got the DVD CSS decryption code working.  As part of this one needs
to look up the LBA of a file to get the decryption key.  Thus one needs to
use the FIBMAP ioctl.  However I've noticed that in 2.2.12 this now has
a capability check (don't know about 2.3.x).
  I could use a suid helper program here,  however I don't see the need
for this capability check.  It does not seem to me that there is any
valid security purpose served by not letting a user of a file determine
the block number(s) it resides in.
  So am I missing something here,  or is that capabilty check completly
spurious?
DF
