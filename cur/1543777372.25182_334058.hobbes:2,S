Proxies can be a good way of filtering but it can't avoid buffer 
overflows. It can only increase it. More code more bugs. If it is 
running on a hardware firewall as a service then its more dangerous as 
once it is compramised then IDS signatures also can be deleated :-). No 
use of IDS the right ?
So the best way is either make your code free of buffer overflows or use 
some library which controls the attack during any buffer overflow or use 
Stack Randomisation and Canary based approaches.
