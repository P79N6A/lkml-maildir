No.
We hold lock->wait_lock. The owner of this lock can be blocked itself,
which makes it necessary to do the chain walk. The indicator is
owner->pi_blocked_on. This field is only protected by owner->pi_lock.
If we look at this field outside of owner->pi_lock, then we might miss a
chain walk.
CPU 0					CPU 1
lock lock->wait_lock
block_on_rt_mutex()
lock current->pi_lock
current->pi_blocked_on = waiter(lock)
unlock current->pi_lock
boost = owner->pi_blocked_on
					owner blocks on lock2
					lock owner->pi_lock
					owner->pi_blocked_on = waiter(lock2)
					unlock owner->pi_lock
lock owner->pi_lock
enqueue waiter
adjust prio
unlock owner->pi_lock
unlock lock->wait_lock
if boost
	do_chain_walk()
->pi_blocked_on is protected by ->pi_lock and has to be read/modified
under this lock. That way we can not miss a chain walk:
CPU 0					CPU 1
lock lock->wait_lock
block_on_rt_mutex()
lock current->pi_lock
current->pi_blocked_on = waiter(lock)
unlock current->pi_lock
					owner blocks on lock2
					lock owner->pi_lock
					owner->pi_blocked_on = waiter(lock2)
					unlock owner->pi_lock
lock owner->pi_lock
enqueue waiter
adjust prio
boost = owner->pi_blocked_on
unlock owner->pi_lock
unlock lock->wait_lock
if boost
	do_chain_walk()
CPU 0					CPU 1
lock lock->wait_lock
block_on_rt_mutex()
lock current->pi_lock
current->pi_blocked_on = waiter(lock)
unlock current->pi_lock
lock owner->pi_lock
enqueue waiter
adjust prio of owner
boost = owner->pi_blocked_on
unlock owner->pi_lock
unlock lock->wait_lock
					owner blocks on lock2
					lock owner->pi_lock
					owner->pi_blocked_on = waiter(lock2)
					unlock owner->pi_lock
if boost
	do_chain_walk()
					owner propagates the priority to owner(lock2)
get_task_struct() is there for a different reason. We have to protect
the gap where we hold _no_ lock in rt_mutex_adjust_prio_chain:
retry:
	lock task->pi_lock
	block = task->pi_blocked_on->lock
	if (! trylock block->wait_lock) {
		unlock task->pi_lock
-> task could go away right here, if we do not hold a reference
		cpu_relax()
		goto retry
	}
