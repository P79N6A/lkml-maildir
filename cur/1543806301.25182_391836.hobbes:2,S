It does work now. How?
I enabled  "Use PIO instead of MMIO". Everything started to work.
I disabled "Use PIO instead of MMIO" and enabled "Use older RX-reset 
method".
Everything still fine.
The crazy thing is that it does work now even with both of the options 
disabled.
It does work even after complete power removal for several hours.
