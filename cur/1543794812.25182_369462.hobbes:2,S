Your friend has to realize that writeout doesn't typically happen in the
context of the process dirtying the data. CFQ will set aside a special
queue(s) for async writeout, though.
But another major interactivity problem he may see is that if you are
dirtying a lot of memory, other processes doing reads may get stuck in
page reclaim when allocating memory (eg getting a new page cache page,
either directly or perhaps through readahead). Then processes X has to
wait for async queue Z to flush out memory, thus becoming dependent on
each other for interactiveness. The io scheduler knows nothing about
this, so it can't really prevent it from happening.
