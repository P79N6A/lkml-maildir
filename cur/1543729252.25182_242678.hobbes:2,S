we used to have code like this in 2.4 but it got removed: the non
temperal store code is faster in a microbenchmark but has the
fundamental problem that it evics the data from the cpu cache; the
actual USE of the data thus is a LOT more expensive, result is that the
overall system performance goes down ;(
