This weird behaviour also can be seen with the BogoMIPS calibration:
Calibrating delay using timer specific routine.. 6428.32 BogoMIPS 
(lpj=12856647)
....
Initializing CPU#1
Calibrating delay using timer specific routine.. 103837.25 BogoMIPS 
(lpj=207674508)
Note, that I never observed that on CPU#0. It always affects CPU#1.
