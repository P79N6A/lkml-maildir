Subject: unable to run busybox /sbin/int

This is the final output from my kernel as I try to launch busybox
(/sbin/init is linked to /bin/busybox)
As it launches the kernel looks for libraries which do not exist (not
sure why), but it appears to find /lib/libcrypt.so.1 and /lib/libc.so.6
but the system does not output after that.  I can press keys on the
keyboard and there are echoed to the screen, I can also use the control
characters C-c, C-s, C-q, and so on and I see kernel messages indication
the uart_flush_buffer(0) is being called but busybox does not appear to
start.  Here is my kernel output, any suggestions would help. Thanks.
