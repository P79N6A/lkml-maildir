No.  For the net device itself, make sure you do
SET_MODULE_OWNER() on the netdev before passing it
to register_netdevice().
For the procfs stuff you must make sure the appropriate
module refcounting is done for that mechanism.
Just deleteing MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT blindly will result
in the module being broken.
