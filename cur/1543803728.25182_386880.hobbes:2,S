POSIX doesn't have a madvise(), but it does have a posix_madvise(), with
flags defined as follows:
POSIX_MADV_NORMAL
   Specifies that the application has no advice to give on its behavior
with respect to the specified range. It is the default characteristic if
no advice is given for a range of memory.
POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL
   Specifies that the application expects to access the specified range
sequentially from lower addresses to higher addresses.
POSIX_MADV_RANDOM
   Specifies that the application expects to access the specified range
in a random order.
POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED
   Specifies that the application expects to access the specified range
in the near future.
POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED
   Specifies that the application expects that it will not access the
specified range in the near future.
Note that glibc forwards posix_madvise() directly to madvise(2), which
means that right now, POSIX conformant apps which use
posix_madvise(addr, len, POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED) are silently corrupting
data on Linux systems.
