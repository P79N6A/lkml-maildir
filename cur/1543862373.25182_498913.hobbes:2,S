Please use the defines like TTY_NORMAL not just 0.

You are't allowed to derefence and call ldisc methods without
holding the lock. You can replace that chunk with a call to the helper
function tty_wakeup(tty). Small but real race condition otherwise as you
xencons_tty->ldisc may be changing as you call it.

A lot of very confusing sign stuff here - you turn an int into a char and
put it into a uchar array

The int coming from a uchar array
Don't think its wrong - just acutely weird and perhaps could be tidier

It would be good in future if you could avoid using tty_mutex and use a
private lock. At the moment vt "borrows" it and there are a couple of
incestuous spots but the plan is to eventually fix them and make it
private to tty_io.
Andrew: No objection to this tty stuff being merged provided the bugs
noted above (not worried about the sign stuff) are fixed before it goes
on to Linus.
