Please CC linux-xfs if you want to be sure XFS people see your
report.

So far I've not been able to reproduce this; I'm using "make clean"
and it works just fine for me (I'm using the current git tree).

No, it looks like XFS is stuck waiting for an IO to complete.

From your earlier report with the stack traces included, it looks
like XFS is waiting for a log write to complete, but it never
does (which is not valid driver behaviour).  I'm using the sym53c8xx
driver in my testing BTW, which is different to you, so maybe see if
this still happens for you with different hardware?  (if you can).

You could also try to drop the XFS (fs/xfs) code from 2.6.14 into
2.6.15-rc2 and see if your problem persists.  There isn't anything
I can see from scanning though everything we committed into .15 so
far that would explain this.  Oh, an easier test you could do would
be to try XFS CVS from oss.sgi.com - that has 2.6.14 + all the XFS
changes since then, so that should confirm/deny an XFS regression
too.  Thanks!
cheers.
