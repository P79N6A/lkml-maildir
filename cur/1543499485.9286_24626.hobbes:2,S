I just realized that I will never get a log of the oops anyway ... it is
dying before sysklogd starts. After I get some sleep and do some work I
will recreate the problem and try to enter the oops text by hand and see
if I can generate something useful.
BTW, Debian users will need to install the binutils-dev package to get
ksymoops to compile.
It is completely repeatable on this system with the last two pre-patches
(the only ones I have tried) but 2.3.6 works fine. I am compiling a UP
kernel as I write this to see if that works.
OK! That seems to have been ONE problem. SMP kernel will not run on a UP
system. Now I seem to find the system hangs when it tries to start process
accounting.
Note that the KERNEL is not hung because it will try to switch to runlevel
6 when I do a ctl-alt-delete but reports some processes that seem to hang.
So basicly, this kernel sux so far on a UP system :)
