Subject: [Patch] cpusets alloc GFP_WAIT sleep fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/16/57

The cpuset mems_allowed update code in alloc_pages_current could
(in theory) put a task to sleep that didn't allow sleeping (did
not have __GFP_WAIT flag set).  In the rare circumstance that
the current tasks mems_generation is outofdate compared to the
tasks cpuset mems_generation, this mems_allowed update code
needs to grap cpuset_sem, which can sleep.
We avoid this by not trying to update mems_allowed here if we
can't sleep (__GFP_WAIT not set).
Applies to top of Linus's bk tree (post 2.6.11)
Thanks to Ray Bryant <raybry@sgi.com> for noticing this.
