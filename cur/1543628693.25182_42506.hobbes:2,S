Trond, et al.
I'm getting poor NFS performance (~250KBps read and write) on 2.4.18 and am
wondering if I'm the only one.  There is no performance drop under other OSs
or other kernel versions, so I don't think it's the server.
Here's the the details:
2.4.18 patched with:
	NFS client patches (linux-2.4.18-NFS_ALL.dif) 
	xfs-1.1-PR1-2.4.18-all.patch
	Ingo's Foster IRQ patch (these are dual Xeons)
If you need any more details, let me know.
Thanks,
Dan
