That's because the original proposal was not very well defined at all.

Who are those people?  What did people want it to be that it now is not?
Will they not speak up publicly?  If not, how do they expect it to
address things they want?

Since when did I ever state that the verbs would be "limited"?  One of
the original issues that people were worried about was the possiblity of
a typo in a verb that we would be forced to live with.  The patch I just
proposed fixes that issue.
All new "verbs" will be submitted to the same kind of review that any
other portion of the kernel code would be subjected to.  Nothing wrong
with that, right?

I agree.  But this interface is not designed or intended for that.

You are correct.  I also would like to see a way ECC and other types of
errors and diagnostics be sent to userspace in a common and unified
manner.  But I have yet to see a proposal to do this that is acceptable.

Great, that also would be wonderful.  Create such a event system for
ACPI if you desire.  I think the ACPI developers are still working on
bigger issues currently.

Please do.

Yeah, namespaces are interesting :)

Patches are always welcome.
