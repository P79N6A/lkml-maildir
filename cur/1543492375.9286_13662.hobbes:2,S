RFC1122 requires that icmp errors get back to the application. POSIX 1003.1g
was written by people who didn't read the RFC. Now that 1003.1g is basically
completed we finally have scope for a spec that means something.
Linux quite intentionally has
#ifdef SO_BSDCOMPAT
	int one=1;
	setsockopt(socket_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_BSDCOMPAT, &one, sizeof(one));
#endif
so you can force the relevant BSDisms. Unfortunately despite repeated requests
to the glibc team it appears this is _still_ not being set by glibc when
you compile with -D__BSD_SOURCE.
