This one (v2-rc2) is not a keeper I'm sorry to say, Ingo.  v2-rc0 was much 
better.  Watching amanda run with htop, kmails composer is being subjected to 
5 to 10 second pauses, and htop says that gzip -best isn't getting more that 
15% of the cpu, and the /amandatapes drive is being written to in a regular 
pattern that seems to be the cause of the pauses  according to gkrellm, which 
also seems to track the size of the writes, and can show anything from 4.3k 
to 54 megs as being written in one cycle of its screen update.
Normally hdd will fire up and take it at about 40+M/second steady till its 
done when there is a file ready to write even if its a 7GB file.  And I can 
type right on during the disk i/o.  But not now.
In short, I seem to be heavily I/O bound.  But when the write to /dev/hdd3 is 
done, then gzip -best pops right up to 90% plus cpu and I get my machine 
back.
In between file writes I checked the drives speed with hdparm:
root@coyote ~]# hdparm -Tt /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd:
 Timing cached reads:   856 MB in  2.01 seconds = 426.15 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  222 MB in  3.01 seconds =  73.68 MB/sec
That's not too shabby, and obviously dma is active at least for the reading.
gzip -best was running while this was executing. So I think the drive is fine 
and the scheduling is whats funkity.  Sorry.
