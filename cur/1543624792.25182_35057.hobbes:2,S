Hi, everybody,
I have problems to run linux from IXA SDK 2.01 onto
an old IXP1200 evaluation board (not IXM1200 board).
I made some config changes, but it does not boot.
The following is my modifications
.config:
   CONFIG_SPECTACLE_ISLAND --> CONFIG_EVAL_BOARD
arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile:
   ZTEXTADDR <- 0xc0808000
arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S:
0xc4004000->0xc0804000 for page table address
drivers/char/serial_ixp1200.c:
38400->9600 for DEFAULT_BAUD
Can anyone figure out which changes I also need to
make?
Thank you
