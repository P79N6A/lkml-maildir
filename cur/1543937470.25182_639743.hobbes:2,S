I have now installed this driver and copied the relevant parts of the
example X configuration file. However, I do not think that this is the
correct driver. I can move the mouse around, but only VERY slowly
(takes 6-7 swipes over the pad just to go from one edge of the screen
to the other), and only the left/right buttons work. Tapping does NOT
work. I also installed and ran gsynaptics. I am not sure how or if
this program will change my X config or not, but changing any settings
there did not have any effect on the mouse at all. (It also showed
that tapping was enabled.)

Where can I find evtest? It is not in my distribution's software
repository (Fedora 8). I have tried to use xev instead (I do not know
if this is sufficient), and it reports the following when I press
up/down buttons:
ButtonPress event, serial 31, synthetic NO, window 0x3200001,
    root 0x13b, subw 0x0, time 2305203062, (49,88), root:(600,409),
    state 0x0, button 4, same_screen YES
ButtonRelease event, serial 31, synthetic NO, window 0x3200001,
    root 0x13b, subw 0x0, time 2305203062, (49,88), root:(600,409),
    state 0x800, button 4, same_screen YES

    state 0x0, button 5, same_screen YES
ButtonRelease event, serial 31, synthetic NO, window 0x3200001,
    root 0x13b, subw 0x0, time 2305205151, (49,88), root:(600,409),
    state 0x1000, button 5, same_screen YES
Still, I wonder if it may be better for me to use the old driver
(ImPS/2 -- is this the Intellimouse?) since this used to work
perfectly for me earlier. Maybe I can just remove the GlidePoint
driver from my kernel to force the older driver?
Kind regards,
