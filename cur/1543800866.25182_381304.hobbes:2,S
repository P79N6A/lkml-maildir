Well, it's not just one function, is it? It'd seem that if you unlined
a whole bunch of stuff (according to this theory) then normal
macro-benchmarks would go faster? Otherwise it's all just rather
theoretical, is it not?

Cool, that sounds good. How much are we talking about?
I didn't see that in the thread anywhere ... perhaps I just
missed it, sorry it got long ;-)
