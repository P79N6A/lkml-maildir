That may be how it does work, but why is that how it *should* work?
If I want bar packed, I'll specify it as packed.  There's no reason
to keep this behavior with a nopadding attribute, as it would be a
new attribute with no existing code to break.
The important thing is that the offsets within the packed/nopadding
struct are exactly as specified, and padding the first element
doesn't change that.
