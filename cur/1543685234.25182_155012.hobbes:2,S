I don't know if you are the same person who asked something very similar
in another mailing list I am also subscribed to, but I followed the
suggestion og Bret Hubert to recompile ipsec-tools against recent kernel
headers, and (nearly) all my problems went away at once.
I used "apt-get source ipsec-tools" from Debian Sid, and just edited
"debian/rules" to delete the ./configure option that points to the
includes packaged with ipsec-tools (so configure looks them at the usual
default location of /lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION/build/includes, where,
in my setup, 2.6.0-test2-mm2 sources are).
There is additional documentation about the native IPsec implementation
available in 2.5.x kernels at 
http://lartc.org
, in the HOWTO.
Hope it helps.
