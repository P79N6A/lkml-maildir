The problem occurs because i386 (as expected) does not define
IA64_UNCACHED_ALLOCATOR. I thought that making the select expression
depend on IA64 as shown below might silence allmodconfig:
  select IA64_UNCACHED_ALLOCATOR if IA64
But my guess was wrong and the same warning appeared. It seems that "if"
expressions do not prevent allmodconfig from checking the symbol
indicated by the select the "if" is conditioning. By the way, is this
the expected behaviour? If so, we need to get rid of the reverse
dependency, modify the "depends on" line accordingly, and make
IA64_UNCACHED_ALLOCATOR selectable. I may be missing the whole point so
please correct if I am wrong.
Regards,
Fernando

The mspec driver's Kconfig entry has a reverse dependency on IA64-specific code, which causes "allmodconfig" to yell on non-Itanium architectures.
