I mangled your patch rather a lot.
- coding style (multiple declarations and multiple assignments)
- `endbyte' should be loff_t, not pgoff_t.
- sync the region (pos, pos+written), not (pos, pos+count).
- attempt to return the correct value from __generic_file_aio_write_nolock
  in all circumstances.
- Avoid testing the O_DIRECT flag twice - just call
  generic_file_buffered_write() from two sites.  Simpler and cleaner that way.
Patch is below.  The end result looks like:
	/* coalesce the iovecs and go direct-to-BIO for O_DIRECT */
	if (unlikely(file->f_flags & O_DIRECT)) {
		loff_t endbyte;
		ssize_t written_buffered;
		written = generic_file_direct_write(iocb, iov, &nr_segs, pos,
							ppos, count, ocount);
		if (written < 0 || written == count)
			goto out;
		/*
		 * direct-io write to a hole: fall through to buffered I/O
		 * for completing the rest of the request.
		 */
		pos += written;
		count -= written;
		written_buffered = generic_file_buffered_write(iocb, iov,
						nr_segs, pos, ppos, count,
						written);
		/*
		 * We need to ensure that the page cache pages are written to
		 * disk and invalidated to preserve the expected O_DIRECT
		 * semantics.
		 */
		endbyte = pos + written_buffered - 1;
		err = do_sync_file_range(file, pos, endbyte,
					 SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE|
					 SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE|
					 SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER);
		if (err == 0) {
			written += written_buffered;
			invalidate_mapping_pages(mapping,
						 pos >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT,
						 endbyte >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT);
		} else {
			/*
			 * We don't know how much we wrote, so just return
			 * the number of bytes which were direct-written
			 */
		}
	} else {
		written = generic_file_buffered_write(iocb, iov, nr_segs,
				pos, ppos, count, written);
	}
out:
	current->backing_dev_info = NULL;
	return written ? written : err;
}
Which I think is closer to correct, but boy it needs a lot of reviewing and
testing.
