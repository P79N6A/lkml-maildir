That 1.2.13 was very stable, my glacial.tmr.com DNS server ran from
shortly after 1.2.13 came out (I had 1-2 patches applied) until Dec 30
1999 when I shut it down because of suspected Y2k issues. It was called
glacial because it was on a 12MB 386sx-16, not because it was so cool;-)
Alan's machine got much more use than mine, but it probably had a lot
more fixes.
