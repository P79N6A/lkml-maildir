Hi,
there's a second, more serious problem with this laptop. It hangs the
in the second swsusp cycle on suspension.
As before 2.6.10, i386/UP/no highmem.
On the screen I get the two messages "radeonfb resumed!" and
"setting latency" superimposed and it hangs forever. This is a regression
the previous user commented: "It worked under 2.6.6"
	Regards
		Oliver
