Jeff, in 2.6.20/fs/reiserfs/xattr.c we have get_xa_root,
which may increment xattr_root reference count either by 1 or 2:
If REISERFS_SB()->xattr_root != NULL - dentry reference count is incremented by 1 with dget.
If REISERFS_SB()->xattr_root == NULL, __get_xa_root is called which may increase xattr_root dentry reference count by 2:
once in lookup_one_len->__lookup_hash->cached_lookup->__d_lookup and once explicitly with dget in __get_xa_root.
Do you think that could be a reason of the extra reference count on   xattr_root dentry?
