Having no performance improvement for kfree seems a little weird, since
we are moving from irq disable to cmpxchg_local in the fast path. A
possible explanation would be that we are always hitting the slow path.
I did a simple test, counting the number of fast vs slow paths with my
cmpxchg_local slub version:
(initial state before the test)
[  386.359364] Fast slub free: 654982
[  386.369507] Slow slub free: 392195
[  386.379660] SLUB Performance testing
[  386.390361] ========================
[  386.401020] 1. Kmalloc: Repeatedly allocate then free test
...
(after test 1)
[  387.366002] Fast slub free: 657338 diff (2356)
[  387.376158] Slow slub free: 482162 diff (89967)
[  387.386294] 2. Kmalloc: alloc/free test
...
(after test 2)
[  387.897816] Fast slub free: 748968 (diff 91630)
[  387.907947] Slow slub free: 482584 diff (422)
Therefore, in the test where we have separate passes for slub allocation
and free, we hit mostly the slow path. Any particular reason for that ?
Note that the alloc/free test (test 2) seems to hit the fast path as
expected.
