Scratch that -- operator failure.  ;)
The patch makes no difference over hibernates in the SMART logs.
It's still logging extra Power-Off_Retract_Count pegs,
which it DID NOT USED TO DO not so long ago.
Now I'll poke at the shutdown again.
Meanwhile, Stephen:  Could you try without this line in the patched file:
        case ATA_16:
+               dev->needs_sync_cache = 1;
Ie. comment out that last "dev->needs_sync_cache" line.
Cheers
