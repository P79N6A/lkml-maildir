We know they're usually not.  There are a *few* that have a clue, but most
don't.  And as the Linux market grows, we're going to have more and more Linux
sysadmins with less than a year's experience...

They're not likely to put careful thought into it, *AND* that saying things
like "AppArmor is so *simple* to configure" only makes things worse - this
encourages unqualified people to create broken policy configurations.
I have no problem with "handles a lot of the grunt work so an
expert can write policy quicker" - there's people working on policy
editors for SELinux that address this as well.  It is however a dis-service
to conflate this with "makes it easy for non-experts to write policy".  Yes,
they may be able to "write policy" easily.  The question is whether it
enables then to "write *correct* policy" (easily, or at all).....
