   What's the best way to retrieve raw packets from the kernel?
   a) use libpcap
 ...   
   b) use af_packet
 ...   
   c) enable CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP, use PACKET_RX_RING
   If I understand it right, b costs one memcpy and one recv, and c costs
   two memcpys.  Which one wins?
"a" should be doing "c" when it is available in the kernel.
If not, get a newer copy of the libpcap sources, preferably
from Alexey's site:
ftp.inr.ac.ru:/ip-routing/
