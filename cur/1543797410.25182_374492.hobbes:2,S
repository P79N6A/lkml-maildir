I did all this with an allyesconfig kernel source and then did :
   make net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.o
   size net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.o
   rm net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.o
then applied the patch and redid
   make net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.o
   size net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_core.o
So I believe the numbers should be correct, but I'm not at home atm,
so I can't verify right now. I won't have a chance to look at it until
tomorrow, but then I'll double-check.
