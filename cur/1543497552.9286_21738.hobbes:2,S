Seconded.
We sometimes want to pass options to init scripts using the kernel
command line, but there's no reason why we can't use the `--' option to
mean "don't parse or error-check for following options", and also let
the kernel know about the few standard ones: `single', `-b',
`emergency', 1..5 etc.
