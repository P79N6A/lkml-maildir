Hi,
Sorry for disturbing you all.
On RAMFS on 2.4 kernel, What is the default directory size? Does the size
of directory(number of blocks) change with the increase in the number of
files or directories under it? If so, please tell me which part of RAMFS
code it is implemented. 
Thanks in advance,
With Regards,
Sathish.J
