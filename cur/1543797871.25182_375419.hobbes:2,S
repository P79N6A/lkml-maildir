Actually, up and down don't imply mutex at all.  So maybe it would be
better to keep up and down as normal semaphores, rename what you want to
mutex_lock / mutex_unlock which makes it obvious what it is, and then
you can go through and find all the semaphores that are being used as
mutexes (or is that mutices?) and make the change more incrementally.
