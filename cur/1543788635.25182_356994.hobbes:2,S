Unfortunately, it's a "stable", not "security stable" release.  Although
a large proportion of the fixes are security-related, the aren't *all*
security - there's also the occasional brown-bag bug or unexpected side
effect that simply causes incorrect operation of the kernel.
Having said that, Coywolf *is* right in that it's a bit unclear that
you have to fetch the 'F'(ull) 2.6.13.3, then get the patch, put that
on with patch -R to get a 2.6.13 tree, and then apply the 2.6.14-rc3 patch.
(Although if you realize that 14-rc3 is diffed off 13.0, not 13.3, it's not
that bad at all)...
I admit being torn between encouraging more people to try -rc kernels, and
wanting to enforce a minimum clue level on those trying to do so....
Hmm.. what if we did something like this:
diff -rup linux-2.6.13/dot.release linux-2.6.13.3/dot.release
--- linux-2.6.13/dot.release    2005-10-09 03:09:54.000000000 -0400

Now if we arrange for that to be the first diff in the patchfile, and
they get it wrong, they'll see:
