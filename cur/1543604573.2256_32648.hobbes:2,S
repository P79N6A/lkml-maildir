If a process is stuck in D state it's a kernel bug - I
don't think it's ever legitimate to wait forever for something
which could never happen. However, some such bugs are rarely
happening (e.g. a swapin failure due to hdd malfunction)
and thus will unlikely be fixed.
PW> But in "R" with your described behavior looks like a bug.
PW> If you care about the CPU time waisted: what about kill -STOP <pid>?
R state unkillable hang is possible too (infinite loop in kernel
preventing return from a syscall).
In short, in my understanding any syscall should return sooner
or later in order to process to be killable. Anything preventing
that is a kernel bug.
However, I'm not a UNIX guru, I may be wrong.
I really like to be enlightened if I'm wrong.
