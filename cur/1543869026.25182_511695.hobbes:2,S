Is this the same monitor you posted here?

If yes, we already have the manufacturer and model code. The main
problem is that the EDID of this display has no sync range (H: 75-75kHz
and V: 60-60Hz).  Extending Hsync from 30-75kHz as a fix to the EDID
block shouldn't be too hard.
I already have a patch for this which I forgot to send to you
before :-).  If you can confirm that this is still the same hardware,
I'll send you a test patch
