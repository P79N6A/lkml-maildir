I'll check, but it works under Windows NT with the same io port and IRQ, 
and I haven't changed any BIOS settings, so I wouldn't think PCI could 
have the IRQ.  
The only other driver that I explicitly configured was the sound driver 
and it uses a different IRQ.  Do you know of any devices that use IRQ 11 
by default?  The devices I have installed on my machine are IDE hard 
disk, modem, SoundBlaster AWE64 (which I checked already), SCSI scanner 
(but no driver for it yet), SCSI Zip Drive, and ATAPI CD-ROM.
Thanks,
Geoff
