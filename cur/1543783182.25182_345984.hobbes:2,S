Adrian-
About saa7134-dvb patch, it is already in -mm and the 2.6.13.y stable 
patch queue, but not yet in -git.  Nobody will complain about it when it 
comes time for 2.6.13.1 review, as it was only left out of 2.6.13 by 
accident.  I sent that in, as it is technically part of v4l tree (even 
though it handles DVB code, saa7134-dvb.c is a hybrid v4l file).  This 
is (probably) the reason why JS didn't send an ACK on my patch, but I 
bet Mauro will ACK it when Chris starts the 2.6.13.1-stable review on LKML.
Good looking on the budget_av patch :-) ... I was just about to respond 
to your email before I saw that Johannes already did.  IMHO, I agree 
that your budget_av patch couldn't hurt to go to stable as well, but 
since JS says it isn't critical, I think you might need to lobby to him 
to change his mind.  Personally, I think that both patches should go to 
2.6.13.y -stable, as it IS a behavior correction for Kconfig kernel 
compilation, and without these patches, some users may be left confused 
with supported hardware that won't work (without some googling).  I 
think it is best for user-friendliness to apply these ASAP.
If you choose to send it to stable, feel free to add:
Acked-by: Michael Krufky <mkrufky@linuxtv.org>
...although, since I am not the official maintainer (Johannes is) I 
don't think my ACK matters by much :-(
