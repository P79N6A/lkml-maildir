Hello,
I installed 2.2.10-ac2 this morning on our 2.2.1 wan router (which stops
every 2 days or so). After circa 5 hours it stopped working just as the
2.2.1 wan router did. Can anyone recommend a 2.2.x kernel that is known
to work reliable with the sangoma wan card and ppp link?
greetings from the Netherlands
