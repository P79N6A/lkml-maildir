I've done it, actually. I've swapped processor, memory and video cards
(which are the only things the boxes actually contain) and there has
been no change. It's very strange - block read and block write consume
enormous amounts of CPU, no matter how much I tinker. I've tried 2.4.19,
2.2.21, NFS patches, etc. 
There could be a hidden BIOS option, but I can't seem to find out what
it is. Both caches are enabled. PCI interrupts are fine. It has to be a
motherboard support problem; in Windows the box runs fine. :-(
Take care,
