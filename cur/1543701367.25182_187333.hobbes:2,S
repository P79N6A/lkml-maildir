Transfered 1,8 GB without any crash. As the nvnet module seems to be part of 
the NVIDIA released drivers I use my Realtek 8139 (like before when I had the 
crashes). I just compiled the NVIDIA drivers and will give it a run. I am 
wondering where the actual bug might be located as you remember that I did 
not use APIC in the first place.
Thanx for help
Jens
