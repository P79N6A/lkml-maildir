Thanks a lot for the pointer: I'd browsed around kernel/printk.c and
not found what I needed, hadn't realized there's a lib/ratelimit.c.
It looks eerily like what I'm trying to do, just a less specific
missed/suppressed message, never mind that.  I'll try making a patch
later to replace this (in its subsequent KERN_ALERT form) by that -
in doing so, perhaps I'll encounter a problem, but should be good.
