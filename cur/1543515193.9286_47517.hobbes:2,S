Hi guys,
pte_to_swp_entry and swp_entry_to_pte are in <asm-i386/pgtable.h> but 
they are used in arch-independent mm/memory.c so I can't compile 
2.3.26-pre2 on ppc architecture :(
Can I just define them in <asm-ppc/pgtable.h>? (I did not try it because 
I don't understand the code in copy_page_range() that uses them).
So, what do we do?
Regards,
Tigran.
