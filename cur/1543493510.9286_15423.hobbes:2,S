Bugs are only one type of stupid human error. Admins with fully enabled
capabilities can cause massive destruction, even without evil intent.

Some bugs, including all buffer overflows, are severe. The distinction
between pP and pE makes no difference for these bugs. Other bugs are
much less severe, and can only be exploited by tricking the process into
doing something that it shouldn't do.

[it was a buffer overflow]

No, it is obvious that no additional protection is provided when the
attacker is able to get such absolute control over the process.
Consider a race condition instead. The process has the ability to
delete any file in pP, but did not put it in pE. The process tries
to delete a file while the attacker changes symbolic links.
The exploit would be stopped, because the attacker is unable to
raise capabilities in the privileged process.
