Hi Andre, 
I have one of these drives. Should I be able to run it off the promise 
controller? (Which didn't boast 48-bit compatibilty when I bought it?)
  Bus  0, device  10, function  0:
    Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc. 20262 (rev 1).
      IRQ 11.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  
      I/O at 0x9400 [0x9407].
      I/O at 0x9800 [0x9803].
      I/O at 0x9c00 [0x9c07].
      I/O at 0xa000 [0xa003].
      I/O at 0xa400 [0xa43f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf74c0000 [0xf74dffff].
I tried it before on a "test-machine" where it ran off the onboard
controller just fine. But in my fileserver on the fast promise 
controller it just hangs while scanning the partition table. 
We're running 2.4.16 with your patch off linux-ide.org. 
	Roger.
