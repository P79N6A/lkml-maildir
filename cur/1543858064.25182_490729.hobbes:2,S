I have created the 'kill-jffs' branch of 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/misc-2.6.git that 
removes fs/jffs.
I argue that you can count the users (who aren't on 2.4) on one hand, 
and developers don't seem to have cared for it in ages.
People are already talking about jffs2 replacements, so I propose we zap 
jffs in 2.6.21.
