Really? Have you looked at the include files for Linux? The standard C 
include files that nearly every program uses will end up also *including* 
Linux kernel header files in order to build programs for Linux. Not all 
programs will end up including those files, but a very large portion 
will.
If you don't believe me, do a grep under /usr/include/sys on your machine 
for 'linux', and see how many of the header files include stuff from 
/usr/include/linux. All the files under /usr/include/linux are part of 
the kernel, so theoretically under the pure GPL, not LGPL.
Then again I say 'theoretically' because once again there is nary a 
kernel header file in sight that actually *has* a GPL license header 
attached! So who knows what license those files are *really* under.
