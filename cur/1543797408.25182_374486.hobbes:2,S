The issue was configuration. Somehow my use of make oldconfig had set a
number of debug options which started out unset. The spinlock changes of
2.6.13-git11 must have changed the overhead of spinlock debugging which
was the cause of the the slowdown I saw when comparing versions.
2.6.15-rc5 runs fine now.
