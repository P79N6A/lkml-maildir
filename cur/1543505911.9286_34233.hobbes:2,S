True.  Will 'struct device' continue to be an annoyance to people, next
year, five years down the road?
If 'struct net_device' is to be used it should be done now, before even
more drivers are written to use the older naming.  Another mitigating
factor might be:  when Linus & dbecker both update their source trees,
you probably cover well over 90% of the cases.
