Without making a big point of it, I do believe that is the motivation 
behind ALSA.
I have used mixers for ALSA, OSS, esd, and artsd. If there is one set of 
tools for ALSA, that is a Good Thing.
Look at any other OS. There are not four individual mixers.
It should start at zero, then when you set the correct volume, it should 
remember it so that you can cat > /dev/dsp and have noise.
The alternative approach is to set the volume very low, but still 
perceptible by default, say 10% or 20%, so that the user is aware of his 
device working, then can set the mixer to a level that is good, which 
the system remembers.
