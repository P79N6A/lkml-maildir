Some little things..
Please feed the diff through scripts/checkpatch.pl.  It finds a lot of issues.
For some reason you added a lot of lines which start with space-tab rather
than tab.  checkpatch does detect this.

please neverevereverever put extern declarations in C files.  Find a
suitable header for it, ensure that the header is included by the
definition site and by all callers.

Need a space here.  Everything I've mentioned thus far should have been
picked up by checkpatch, so I'll shut up now.

This is tricky code which you're adding.  Empirically-based stuff derived
from observation and experimentation.  It is quite impossible for readers
of this code to work out what the code is doing and why it is doing it
purely by reading the C statements.
Hence for any form of maintainability you really do need to spell
*everything* out in code comments.  All those little discoveries and
observations.  Otherwise it'll be lost, unless the fraught reader decides
to go hunting in the git repository.

Although the compiler will inline this function for you, we'd
conventionally declare it static inline.  We might as well do this here as
well, and fix up nmi_shootdown_cpus() too.

The above two functions are unneeded if CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=n, hence they
should have the appropriate ifdef wrapping.
