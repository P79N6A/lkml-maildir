a reader like ifconfig can easyly work around this with multiple tries, but
incremeting those variables wont work that easy, and therefore needs a lock,
which will be a major pita.
64bit counters should be a result of lockless per-cpu network counters
(32bit) with some kind of async merging.
Or we wait till 64bit hardware is more common :)
