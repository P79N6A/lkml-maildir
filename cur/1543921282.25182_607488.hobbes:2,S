Good question.  At first glance I think the call sites are ok, that
is where we have the information now.  Non-genirq architectures needs
work of course.
However given the weird poll case etc that either we need to take this
slow and delay this change until all of the drivers are fixed up, to
not need an irq parameter (as you suggested).  Or that we need to 
allow both forms of irq handler to coexist temporarily.
