Hi
i've been tracking the list the last months and i'm not pretty sure if i
am right on the above sentences
* there was an strange bug on 2.2.x kernels that causes fs corruption
  somewhere from 2.2.8 to 2.2.10 that should be fixed on 2.2.10ac10.
  the problem here is that i can hardly found where is the code that
  should fix that bug.. since i can't find that code.. i'm not sure
  if this patch is also included on 2.2.11pre2 which i'd like to package.
  since i've been unable to make this bug appear on any of my test systems
  SMP or not.. i'm a little worried if it could suddenly appear on any
  other system that this kernel package is installed before.
* there has been two "strange" patches on bugtraq talking on problems on
  the linux TCP/IP stack that weren't "officially" patched here... are
  they real problems?

this was posted for Richard Bouska <risa@GSL.KRALUPY.CZ>, and is supposed
to fix a "Kernel Panic" when doing (quoted from the post):
"ping -R a NAT ed ip from a real ip ( it has to go through the fw ) or
 ping -R a real ip from a NATed one fw has to be below hop 9 on this road
 otherwise it doesnt work."
  this patch isn't on any -ac patch for 2.2.10, nor on 2.2.11pre2, is it
  real?
  the other patch is about a ipchains problem and was posted by: John
McDonald <jm@dataprotect.com> and Thomas Lopatic <tl@dataprotect.com>

  neither on -ac patches... is this a real problem? or just FUD?
* i've found a warning about share interrupt support on the "Kernel
  Newsflash" that says
  "The 2.2.x serial driver has a bug that interferes with interrupt sharing
  for multifunction cards.  The effect is that opening a serial port on a
  multifunction card fails, giving an IO error." 
  does it mean that i need to do a patch for making a multiport serial
  card, like the Cyclades to work?, sorry but i am a newbie on such kind
  of cards.  if it is true, why isn't the kernel patched on default?,
  wouldn't it be nicer? or just any other serial function won't work..,
  if we need a "switching" option, why don't use a /proc entry?
thanks in advance for any feedback regarding this
Carlo
