Hello all,
Often, I have wondered what the need for 64 tty devices in /dev is. I began tinkering with the code and am wondering why it's not user configurable. I came up with a quick patch to add it as an option under drivers/char/Kconfig. I also made a lower bound of 12. If this is an idea worth pursuing, please let me know. If this idea has been rejected before, I apologize. What do you think of this idea?
Thanks You,
Jason Cox
