This email lists some known regressions with workarounds in 2.6.19-rc2 
compared to 2.6.18.
Unless proper solutions become available, we should implement the 
workarounds.
If you find your name in the Cc header, you are either submitter of one 
of the bugs, maintainer of an affectected subsystem or driver, a patch 
of you caused a breakage or I'm considering you in any other way 
possibly involved with one or more of these issues.
Please trim the Cc when answering.
