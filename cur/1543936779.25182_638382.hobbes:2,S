Please always retain and maintain the full changelog with each version of a
patch.  The changelog in your earlier "Clustering indirect blocks in Ext3"
patch was good.  I retained that (after renaming it to "ext3: indirect
block clustering" rather than this dopey name) and then, err, dropped the
patch ;)
Please cc linux-ext4 on ext2/3/4-related work.
Please update Documentation/filesystems/ext3.txt when adding new mount
options.
Here's a quick low-levelish nitpickingish implementation review.  I haven't
thought about the design-level things yet.
This code will need careful checking regarding the journalling side of
things - to verify that if the machine crashes at any stage, recovery will
produce a consistent and secure fs.  It is all-nigh impossible to spot bugs
in this area via the usual kernel bug reporting process and it is very hard
to effectively runtime test recovery even in a development situation. 
Careful review unusually important here.

hm, so ext3_count_free() hits prime time.
ext3_count_free() should be converted to use the standard hweight8(). 
Really it should be converted to hweight_long() or hweight32() or something
- it is presently probably inefficient.
This function appears to be called frequently and it calls the slow-looking
ext3_count_free() under spinlock.  This might have scalability problems on
the right machine running the right workload.
Can we address that before we hit it?

Far too large to inline.  Please just remove all inlines from the patch. 
The compiler will sort it out.

Please rename `k' to something meaningful.
The logic in here looks odd.  If (map[k/8] != 0xff) then the
ext3_find_next_zero_bit() cannot fail.  So why do we test for it in this
fashion?
Perhaps some commnetary is needed here.

Little style nit: in bitmap_find_prev_zero_bit() you used (lowest < k)
which is a little surprising but I assumeed that you were following the (a
< b < c) layout.  But here you're not doing that.

Whoa.  The first ever use of cpu_relax in a filesystem (apart from sysfs,
but that's hardy endorsement).

If you're concerned here I'd suggest that you formulate a question for the

It's pretty regrettable that ext3 now starts using bios directly.  All of
jbd and ext3 has thus far avoided this additional coupling.

Please prefer to use the (much) friendlier ext3_error() over the
user-hostile BUG.  Where it makes sense.
This is especially the case where the assertion could be triggered by
corrupted disk contents - doing a BUG() in response to that is a coding
bug.

Both count and EXT3_IND_READ_MAX are plain old int.  Forcing them to ulong
for this comparison is a little odd.
Please check whether those two things have appropriate types - can they
ever legitimately go negative?  I doubt it, in which case they should have
unsigned types.
Please review all newly-added min_t's for these things.

brelse() is an old-fashioned thing which checks for a NULL arg.  Unless you
really have a bh* which might legitimately be NULL, please prefer put_bh().

Again, I really don't see why we needed to dive into the BIO layer for
this.  Why not use submit_bh() and friends for all of this?
Also, why is it necessary to do block sorting at the filesystem level?  The
block layer does that.

I'm wondering about the interaction between this code and the
buffer_boundary() logic.  I guess we should disable the buffer_boundary()
handling when this code is in effect.  Have you reviewed and tested that
aspect?
