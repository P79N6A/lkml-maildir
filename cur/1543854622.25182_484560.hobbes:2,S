Thanks, I can actually apply the patch now, as opposed to the apparently
base64-encoded version that was just junk to me.
Of course, we can't review it easily when it's an attachment.
It would be a Good Thing for you to experiment with some email clients
that can send patches inline (not as attachments, not as base64) and
which do not mangle the whitespace and do not encode the text.
Back to the patch:  it's only for i386.  Does x86_64 need
similar treatment?
