Script kiddies don't write the exploit code themselves.  And for those
who write the code it is no problem to circumvent the signature
testing.

But they have Perl, Python, etc.  Those are sufficient.  Heck, I can
cause havor with bash.

Take signed binaries off of this list and you don't lose anything.

It is a little one-time effort.  This approach differs in that it
simply shifts the way binaries are introduced.  I can write a dynamic
loader in Perl.  and after that I don't load ELF binaries through the
kernel ever again.  If such a loader doesn't exist today it could very
well exist in a few months and after that this "protection" is
completely useless.  Every script kiddy will have it.
This is the big difference to techniques like randomization which
might be circumventent with a certain probability but never fully can
be removed.  Stacking those kind of protections is a good idea
because, if they are not fully correlated, the stacking provides
additional protection.  Signed binaries do not.
