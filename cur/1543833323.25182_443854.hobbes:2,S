Huh? How exactly is this different from system call numbers,
ioctl numbers, fcntl numbers, ptrace command numbers, and every
other part of the Linux ABI?
Normal sysctl works very well for FreeBSD. I'm jealous.
They also have a few related calls that are very nice.
Here we fight over a few CPU cycles in the syscall entry path,
then piss away performance by requiring open-read-close and
marshalling everything through decimal ASCII text. WTF? Let's
just have one system call (make_XML_SOAP_request) and be done.
