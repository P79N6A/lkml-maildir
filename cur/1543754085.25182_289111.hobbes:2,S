correct. the yamaha ymf interfaces are a joke for low latency
audio. they weren't designed correctly at the h/w level, and they
don't work correctly for low latency on Windows with ASIO either. i
don't know what yamaha was thinking, since other companies understood
how to do this long before the first YMF card came out.
