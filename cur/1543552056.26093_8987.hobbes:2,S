  Hello.
  I found one bug in the quota fixes (forgot to mark_inode_dirty()
when i_blocks were changed). Patch which fixes this is at:
  
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota/v2.4/quota-fix-2.4.0-test9-2a.diff
It's supposed to be applied after quota-fix-2.4.0-test9-1.diff in the same directory.
Note that this bug could cause inconsistency of i_blocks (which shouldn't matter much)
on your filesystem so do fsck if you tested previous patch before further testing.
							Bye
								Honza
