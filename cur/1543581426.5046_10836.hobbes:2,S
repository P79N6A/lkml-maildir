Yes. For completness (though irrelevant):
2.4.0-ac2 -> ac6 : DMA mapping + rev9 fixes from Andreas Steinmetz
2.4.0-ac7 -> ac10: Merge becker version 1.11 + pci_enable. No DMA mapping
2.4.0-ac11       : Merge becker version 1.11 + pci_enable + DMA mapping

          ^^^^^^
No wonder the system feels sluggish.

The following informations may help:
- motherboard type
- bios revision
- lspci -x 
- 2.4.2pre3 + whatever recent ac epic100 = ?
