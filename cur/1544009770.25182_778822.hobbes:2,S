There is a problem with CIFS in 2.6.27.8, but it mainly manifests
itself as a kthread that doesn't shut down when it should (regression
due to a missing couple of prerequisite patches). I've got a patch for
2.6.27.9 that should fix that problem (assuming there is a .9)
The fixes that went into 2.6.27.8 were mostly patches to fix races on
mount and unmount and some fixes for socket handling. The problem
you've described seems very consistent and localized to an area that
wasn't patched in .8.
I could easily be wrong, but the problem you've described seems more
likely to be a server issue. If you can get binary network captures
between the client and server like Steve F. requested, then we should
be able to confirm it either way...
