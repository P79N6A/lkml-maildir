Sorry. My reseller has told me a load of bull. In any case, I tried
compiling with all of the Celeron options, and I recall that _all_ set
SSE2, I think I must have screwed up on too much coffee, since checking
now, the .config file only has SSE2 flags for Celeron-P4, while I seem
to recall having compiled first for PIII-Celeron and still having the
kernel panic for SSE2, maybe somewhere the config files got screwed.
I feel so dumb.
