Thanks for the pointer Richard.  I've wondered why PNG hasn't
superceeded GIF yet, and figured that it was supported.  I am
running Netscape Communicator 4.05 and I just tried to load a PNG
into it.  The PNG displayed just fine.  As such, I am going to
use *ONLY* PNG graphics on my web pages, etc from now on.  If
someone can't display them, then it is time for them to upgrade
their browser to something that does, and perhaps dump Win95 for
Linux as well.
Thanks.
