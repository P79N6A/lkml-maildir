it's the changes in the 2.6.5-rc1 page_referenced usage that requires us
to return 0, Andrew may want to elaborate those details.
if you don't fix it your set of patches will hang the box hard if you
hit swap with shared memory swap load.

There's no such thing in Dave's objrmap patch.

my mapcount is an unsigned long, so it doesn't matter, but I think I can
make it an unsigned int, that sounds a good idea since I doubt anybody
will ever fork >4G processes with 2.6. Only after making it an unsigned
it it will matter to position it near the atomic_t on 64bit.
