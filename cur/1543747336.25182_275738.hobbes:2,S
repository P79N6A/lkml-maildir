That I can agree with.  I never said that this was a full solution,
only that this shows, that the deadlock is not inherent in userspace
filesystems.

Not pretty is an understatement IMO.

Yes, and it's the jiggling I want to avoid.

I have observed it too (not yet fixed, but working on it).  But
realize that my proposal would excempt userspace filesystem pages from
being blocked on by kswapd.  That's a fundamental difference.
Since you don't believe me, I'll have to make an implementation, so
you can experiment with it.  And if you'll still be able to cause a
deadlock, I'll subject myself to extreme repentance, and promise never
to touch an operating system ever again :)

And once fuse acounts for memory there will be no deadlock and no oom.
See the symmetry?
