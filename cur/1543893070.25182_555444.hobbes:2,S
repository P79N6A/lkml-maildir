Subject: beeping patch for debugging acpi sleep
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Starting beeper as soon as ACPI sleep returns is very useful in
debugging "apparently dead" machines. If it beeps at all, it makes
sense to start playing with CMOS tracer.
