Somebody just mailed me a patch too, but I found the following discrepancy:
/*
 * scsi_unregister will be called AFTER we return. 
 */
static int adpt_release(struct Scsi_Host *host)
{
    adpt_hba* pHba = (adpt_hba*) host->hostdata[0];
//  adpt_i2o_quiesce_hba(pHba);
    adpt_i2o_delete_hba(pHba);
    scsi_unregister(host);
    return 0;
}
This is used to release the host, now read the comment, and then the
line just before the return.  This line was added by the patch, which
also commented out the quiesce line.  Is it possible to get any
confirmation on how this is supposed to function?
Jaco
