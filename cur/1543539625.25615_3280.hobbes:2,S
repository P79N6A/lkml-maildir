A nice feature - so WTF did it go on newer mobos? Are jumpers REALLY that
expensive? ;-)

IOW, ONE particular driver SOMETIMES needs to do this. Why can't it be
done via the kernel? Everything else is fine this way...

It's almost exactly the same. One approach blocks the harmful command
unconditionally, the other makes it condition on a special setting. Hardly
worth starting YALKFW (Yet Another L-K Flame War) over, surely, especially
since there aren't any valid uses for this command yet...
IMO, Andre's patch should go in, maybe leaving a "backdoor" for later in
case we need it. I'd prefer to keep HDD firmware updates on the same level
as CPU microcode updates, NVRAM access etc (i.e. going via a kernel
driver properly), though.
