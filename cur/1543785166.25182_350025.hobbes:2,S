Right.

This happens on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, with a 2.6.9 kernel (with
a gazillion of Red Hat patches in it, latest ones being from 2.6.11)
and the ip_queue patch that adds the bottom-half disabling. I will
know for sure tomorrow, but it seems that it doesn't appear on vanilla
2.6.13.1 or without SMP.
It is very hard to know which packet specifically triggers this. The
machine is under heavy load in general, a lot of packets are handled
via a QUEUE target, and some packets are captured via packet socket.
I will post more details tomorrow, but if you could point me towards
the changes in ip_conntrack that affected this, it would be very
helpful. I could check if they are in the Red Hat kernel and if not,
patch them manually and see if it makes a difference. The problem is
now reproduciable in a couple hours, so it shouldn't be too hard.
Thanks,
