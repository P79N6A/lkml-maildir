...assuming that they don't need to access many local variables.   And don't
have any "goto" statements... and... etc, etc.

As I described in my other mail on this thread, the _ideal_ solution would
be to tell the compiler that BUG() is a __rarely_called function (well, it's
a macro now but it could be made into an inline function) and let the
compiler figure the rest out without further annotation

Assuming "-funit-at-a-time" (which all archs will probably be using soon)
you'd probably get exactly the same opcodes either way.
