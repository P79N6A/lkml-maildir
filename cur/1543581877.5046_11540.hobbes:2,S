eh?
pci_register_driver(struct pci_driver *drv)
{
        struct pci_dev *dev;
        int count = 0;
        list_add_tail(&drv->node, &pci_drivers);
        pci_for_each_dev(dev) {
                if (!pci_dev_driver(dev))
                        count += pci_announce_device(drv, dev);
        }
        return count;
}
Maybe you're thinking of pci_module_init?
Now, if there were some actual COMMENTS (scary, I know) in the pci
code which described the API, stuff like this wouldn't happen.
