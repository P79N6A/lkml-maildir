You can do that with classzone with SYSRQ+M. There's a "map: " line that tells
you how many pages of page cache in the system are mapped in userspace memory.
This is done by accounting this information during page fault while dropping
the page from the lru_cache (the information is not in function of the aging
heuristic).
