	I think TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE  must be per process issue. Some time
ago I proposed a patch for /proc/sys/kernel/task_unmapped_base sysctl for
2.2.13+ (10-DEC-1999). It is a system setting for x86 users but can help
until malloc() switches to using brk() + mmap(). When malloc can do
this we can set TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE to a small value. Or may be brk()
allocations are preferred. But until then, the task_unmapped_base sysctl
is very useful for big shared regions (DB servers). So, may be it is
useful the process to be able to set this value but for now I don't know
how. Is it possible task_unmapped_base to be per process value? The
default value will be the system setting? /proc/#/task_unmapped_base? Or
may be this is not a good approach? In fact, it can't be controlled
because the shared libs are already mapped to the system value before the
process can change the value. So, may be only the system setting is
useful?
