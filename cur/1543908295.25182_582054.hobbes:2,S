Now all the data in the zero page and standard boot protocol are
collected by the EFI bootloader. The EFI bootloader does this through
calling the EFI boot services. If the data is intended to be collected
in kernel setup code, the EFI boot services must be used inside kernel
setup code to collect the data.

So, for booting Linux kernel on EFI platform, the process you proposed
(named process A in the letter) will be as follow:
1. Bootloader loads the Linux kernel image into memory
2. Bootloader setups the parameter defined in standard boot protocol
(need some extension for EFI)
3. Bootloader jumps to kernel EFI 32bit/64bit entry point
4. Kernel EFI setup code collects the data in the zero pages through
calling the EFI boot services
5. Kernel EFI setup code jumps to decompressor entry point
6. Kernel decompressor jumps to kernel entry point (startup_64), which
then jumps to x86_64_start_kernel
7. The EFI memory map is converted to E820 map in x86_64_start_kernel,
and the result is stuffed into zero page.
8. Kernel booting up continues with the E820 map and other data of zero
page.
The process of current EFI implementation (named process B in the
letter) is as follow:
1. Bootloader loads the Linux kernel image into memory
2. Bootloader setups the parameter defined in standard boot protocol
3. Bootloader collects the data in the zero pages through calling the
EFI boot services
4. Bootloader converts EFI memory map to E820 map, the result is stuffed
into zero page.
5. Bootloader jumps to kernel decompressor entry point
6. Kernel decompressor jumpto kernel entry point (startup_64), which
jumps to x86_64_start_kernel
7. Kernel booting up continues with the E820 map and other data of zero
page.
Compares the above two process, we can find that the main difference
lies in:
1. Boot protocol. The process A uses standard boot protocol with some
EFI extension + EFI 32bit. The process B uses the standard boot protocol
+ zero page protocol (which is internal now).
2. In process A, the zero page data setupping and E820 converting are
done by kernel, while in process B, these are done done by bootloader.
The advantages of process A:
1. The zero page protocol can be made internal, so it is more
extensible.
The advantages of process B:
1. The EFI boot support code of Linux kernel is minimal. In fact,
current EFI boot support patch only adds a frame buffer driver. And I do
not see any more needed except some firmware information (ACPI root
pointer, SMBIOS pointer, etc) maybe need to be passed through zero page.
The issues of process A:
1. To support multiple BIOS/bootloader with one kernel binary image,
multiple setup binaries must be integrated into kernel binary image. At
end, the layout of the bzImage of Linux kernel may become as follow:
bootsect + lagacy BIOS setup + EFI32 setup + EFI64 setup + LinuxBIOS
setup + kexec setup + decompressor + vmlinux binary
That is, there is one "setup" for each BIOS type. Because the EFI32 and
EFI64 is not bianry compatible, two EFI setup is needed at least for
i386 kernel.

It seems that the only way for kexec is to use the standard boot
protocol + zero page protocol. If this is true, the zero page protocol
should be made external, so EFI can use it too.

Yes, all pointers should be physical. But some pointers come from
firmware such as ACPI root pointer, EFI system table pointer should be
64bit, because we can not control the actual position pointed to.
