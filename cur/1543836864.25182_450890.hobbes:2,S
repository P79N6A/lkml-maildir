Subject: [patch] Crash on evdev disconnect.

While trying to figure out the best way to handle an odd mouse, I found
that we oopsed when doing a rmmod on usbhid while someone had a USB
device open through evdev.
We try to loop through evdev->list, calling kill_fasync on each member,
however by the time we try to get the next pointer, we have already
freed the member and poisoned the next/last.
The fix is fairly simple, and if nobody objects I think we should try
and get this into -stable too.

"Sir," barked one of those useless aristocratic generals to William
Howard Russell, the great Times war correspondent, "I do not like what
you write." "Then, sir," retorted Russell, "I suggest you do not do what
I write about."
