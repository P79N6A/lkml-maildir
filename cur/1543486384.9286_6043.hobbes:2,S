Last time I checked, the filehandle for any particular file had to be
_constant_ from a client's point of view, even if the server reboots.
You could for example hash and encrypt the device and inode number of
each file and the IP address of the client with a secret key and use
that as an NFS filehandle.  However, you can't use a timestamp in there
unless you are willing to accept all possible values of the timestamp
as aliases for the same file (and you're likely to cause some severe
caching inconsistency on the client if you do this anyway).
