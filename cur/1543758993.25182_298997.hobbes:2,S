Interesting.  We already have a pre-Linus tree, in Andrew's *-mm.
Currently, each distro adds its own set of patches, on top of some
version of a Linus tree.  If we had a blessed post-Linus tree, which the
2.6.<even>.y numbering fits, then we could unify this post-Linus tree
patching to some degree as well, to the general benefit of most everyone
involved.  A bit of holy penguin pee, a chosen spot in the official
numbering scheme, and a good choice of penguin prince as manager of this
release series should be enough to get this going.
