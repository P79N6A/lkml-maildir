which makes perfect sense, of course.

agreed on that last point.  my patch submission to change "depends" to
"depends on" globally *did* get applied recently:
commit 775ba7ad491a154f99871fe603f03366e84ae159

    Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bunk/trivial
    * git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bunk/trivial:
      ...
      kconfig: Standardize "depends" -> "depends on" in Kconfig files
      ...
so it's clear that that transformation was approved.  now we just wait
for the patch to deal with the last three files to go through and
we're all set.
$ grep "depends" $(find . -name Kconfig) | grep -v "depends on"
./arch/arm/mm/Kconfig:  depends !MMU && CPU_CP15 && !CPU_ARM740T
./arch/arm/Kconfig:     depends CPU_XSCALE || CPU_XSC3
./arch/v850/Kconfig:      depends !V850E2_SIM85E2C
