OK, we can discuss that as well, but what do you think of the particular
patch that I supplied?  It is independent of the naming of types.  If I
can get linux/compat32.h and CONFIG_COMPAT32 started, the consolidation
will preceed fairly rapidly and I think that is far more important than
what the names look like ...

This will be allowed for when linux/compat32.h includes asm/compat32.h
at a later stage.  asm/compat32.h will be expected to have typedefs for
compat32_<type> (or __kernel_<type>32 whatever) for all the types that
vary between the architectures.
