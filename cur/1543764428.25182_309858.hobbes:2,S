Well put - though you're more diffident about it than I would be!
Furthermore, it only allows NULL pointers and suchlike to be weeded
out on the ARM (and ARM26) architecture, no other.  I'm not averse
to optimizing ARM and ARM26, but it's much too insignificant an
optimization to warrant reference to such an architectural detail.
And it breaks the (peculiar) sys_mincore convention of doing all the
work while returning -ENOMEM, if there were any holes in the address
range.  David's check stops it from doing any work in that case.
FIRST_USER_ADDRESS should be used in the very few places
it is necessary, and not spread around beyond them.
