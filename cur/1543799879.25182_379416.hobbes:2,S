Also, while we are at it, can you try this patch on top of current
-git ? What I _think_ might be happening is that the X server is also
trying to muck around with the card memory map and is forcing it back
into a wrong setting that also happens to no longer match what the DRM
wants to do and blows up. There are bugs all over the place in that code
(and still some bugs in the DRM as well anyway). This patch attempts to
avoid that by using the largest of the 2 values, which I think will
cause it to behave as it used to for you and will still fix the problem
with machines that have an aperture size smaller than the video memory.
That might be good enough until I fully fix X and the DRM (work in progress
but there are other "issues").
