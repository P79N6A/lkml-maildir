I'm seeing a bit of a disconnect here.  If you spent all that time making it
work, how come the guys who developed the patch are saying you didn't provide
any feedback about the patchset?

Odd, I looked at the patchset fairly closely a number of times, as I was
hand-retrofitting the -rc[1-4] versions onto -rc[1-4]-mm kernels, and it looked
to *me* like it was a nice set of 20 or so step-by-step changes (bisectable
and everything - I got to do that once trying to figure out which one I botched).
Was there something in there that I missed?
