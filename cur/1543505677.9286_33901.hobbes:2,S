Subject: Freezes on bootup with 2.2.11 on a PPRO SMP system
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I installed 2.2.11 on my dual PPRO yesterday and found that it
wouldn't boot completely.  It seems to get as far as the PCI probe,
and then it freezes hard (the magic SysReq incantation has no effect).
This is reproducible consistently.
This is a pretty much stock RedHat 5.2 system, with the vanilla
2.2.11 kernel.  I'm using the same config as the 2.2.10 kernel
that works (with an updated .config file for the new options,
generated by "make config").  
This is a Tyan Titan Pro with two processors.
These are the last few lines before it freezes:

Here is the first portion of the bootup messages from a 2.2.10 kernel 
(that works fine):
