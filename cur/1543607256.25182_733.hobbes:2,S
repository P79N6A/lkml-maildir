Both the pivot_root(8) manpage and the <linux>/Documentation/initrd.txt 
document admonish us to do much more than shown below (chroot, relative 
pathing of pivot_root arguments, etc).
I certainly trust HPA's example, but it is a far sight from the
'documented' procedure.  If the pivot_root developers expect
everyone in the world who depended previously on an implicit
change_root to modify their procedures,  they have the
responsibility to see that the "better way" is understood.
If HPA's example is adequate the documentation should be modified.
