That's silly.  Userland issues (glibc, etc.) are discusssed on this list
-- not to any great depth, but enough so that many people know what the
basic issues are.
Also, Richard is posting only a fraction of the messages in this thread,
and the bulk of what he's saying is in response to others.
Anyways, if you truly want people to stop discussing this topic on
this list, the right thing to do is send private email to every person
who brings up the topic on this list, asking them to stop (and maybe
explaining your reasons).  If you only ask people on one side of the
argument to stop you're just feeding the flames.  If you don't ask
privately, you're just adding to the thread.
