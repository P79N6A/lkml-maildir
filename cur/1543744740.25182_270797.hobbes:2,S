I don't use a 2.4 kernel, so i can produce patch for older kernel, but i'll
not test them. If someone want a 2.4 kernel tell me, and i'll try to mande a
patch using difftools. I prefer to add features like v4l2, than supporting
and testing old kernel (or writing documentation).

If the old driver supports, mine too (minor some very old webcam).
