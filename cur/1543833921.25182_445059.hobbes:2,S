Just installed a new box, stock kernel didn't come up right. Installed
linux-2.6.18-rc2 (had one hard time at that one as keyboard acted
strange and network didn't work).
The real fun is this: to begin kernel build, I had to restore
toolchain to working order like so:
# ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.18-rc2/include/linux /usr/include/linux
# ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.18-rc2/include/asm-i386 /usr/include/asm
# ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.18-rc2/include/asm-generic /usr/include/asm-generic
Now the fun part: if I recall, I do make headers_install to install
the kernel headers
in the right place. Doing this before running those fix lines doesn't
work because the
build environment is broken. Doing this after looks like it would
clobber the kernel headers.
Solution?
