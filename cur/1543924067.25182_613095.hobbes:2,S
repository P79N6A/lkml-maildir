No, we don't. I'm pretty sure. It didn't work with the VM cleanups, since 
the MAP_SHARED vma's won't be on the anonymous list any more, and cannot 
be swapped out.
So now, if you try to write to a read-only shared page through ptrace, 
you'll get "Unable to access".
Of course, I didn't really look closely, so maybe I just don't remember 
things right..

Well, as we should. There's no way for a debugger to get those pages back. 
So that all looks sane.

This looks totally bogus. What was the intent of this patch?
The VM_MAYWRITE flag is *not* supposed to track the VM_WRITE flag: that 
would defeat the whole purpose of it! The whole point of that flag is to 
say whether mprotect() could turn it into a VM_WRITE mapping, and it 
depends on the file mode, not VM_WRITE!

More apparent bogosities.
