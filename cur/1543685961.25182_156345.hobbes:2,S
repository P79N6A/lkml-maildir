When I build 2.4.22rc2 with gcc 3.3, I get the following warnings
vt.c:166: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
vt.c:283: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
keyboard.c:644: warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of data type
It seems an unsigned char is being compared with 256, which always returns false.
