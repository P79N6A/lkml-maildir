hm, OK.  So, where are we up to?
I still worry about the fact that changes in this area could cause the
kernel to do a *lot* more IO attempts against failed devices, or failed
sectors.  We already have a few problems in that area.
What is the actual real-world operational scenario here?  Would it be a
hotplugged disk?  A transient network failure in a SAN?  IOW, is it
something from which the kernel should automatically recover, or it is a
situation in which manual intervention would be better?
