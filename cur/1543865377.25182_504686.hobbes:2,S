yeah, i realized this when i sent the mail. I wanted to say 'array of 
elements' - and it's clear from these list heads that it's fully out of 
order. (it should be an array so that the pages of those entries can be 
pinned and that completion can be manipulated from any context, 
anytime.)
(the queueing i described closely resembles Tux's "Tux syscall request" 
handling scheme.)

sure - it should be variable but still the array should be compact, and 
should be registered with the kernel. That way security checks can be 
done once, the pages can be pinned, accessed anytime, etc.
