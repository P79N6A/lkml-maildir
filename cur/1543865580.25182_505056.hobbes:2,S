You can also try to disable tcp_window_scaling.
Can you provide a tcpdump trace of the connection? Traces with and
without SACK would be appreciated, also a trace with SACK but without
window scaling would be useful. I only need the headers of the packet so
-s 60 (the default) will be fine.
There was a change in 2.6.20 that I put but it should only have affected
the sender side and even then only the way it interpreted the data and
not things it sent on the wire.
Trying the dl with previous kernels can also help, if only to try and
pinpoint where things went bad, assuming it is in the kernel. This
sounds like a bad implementation of ACK window checks that ICSA requires
for firewall product certification.
