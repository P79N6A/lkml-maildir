Mr Dominik, all,
                I tried your patch on top of the kernel 2.6.17.13 that
came with ubuntu
        edgy (and had sufficient trouble with it, I do not know if I'll be able
        to try with a recent kernel.). This message is in copy to akpm which
        asked me a report on the same problem.
        I applied your patch and this one:
        
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/1/179
        but the kernel continues to ignore the second function of my card.
        Moreover, now the modem does not work even with the dear old cardmgr:

        Mr Morton, do you still think I should open a bug in bugzilla? Even if I
        have not tested a newer kernel? It seems to me that nothing has changed
        over there, and this _is_ a regression (from 2.6.13, even).
        Romano
        PS: can anyone point me to a tutorial on howto install a new kernael
        easily on ubuntu? The procedure they point to (creating deb package,
        installing, etc) are quite cumbersome. Anyway, I will try.
