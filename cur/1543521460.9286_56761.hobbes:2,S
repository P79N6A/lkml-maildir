Ok, here's the first pre-patch for v2.0.39. This one contains no
surprises, just the patch that set the roller-coaster in motion, and some
small Documentation-updates. Expect to see a pre2 soon. Consider this a
(somewhat late) New Year's bonus. It's much more healthy than champagne,
both for you and your computer.
2.0.39pre1
o       Fix for the ping -s 65468 exploit       (Andrea Archangeli + others)
o       Small updates to MAINTAINERS            (me)
o       Small updates to CREDITS                (me)
o       Update Documentation/Changes            (me)
        to mirror the needed binutils version
