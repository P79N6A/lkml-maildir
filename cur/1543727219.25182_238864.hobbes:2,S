okay - my last email in this matter to LKML, but: it seems to only work
fine if you use ide-scsi and configure it acordingly. on our system, where
I have disabled scsi completely (ide-scsi doesnt work at all for certain
tasks, and beside from that, I need scsi), cdrecord/cdrtools will terminate with
"Cannot open /dev/hdX. Cannot open SCSI driver".
this is the reason why the patch forces the ata (atapi?) driver. no
SCSI driver or configuring of ide-scsi required.

well, sigh .... been there, done that, but emails to Joerg seem to have
a long RTT. therefore, LKML. sorry for the inconvenience :->
