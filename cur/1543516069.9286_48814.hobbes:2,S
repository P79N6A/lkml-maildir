the solution is to:
 -#include <asm/pgtable.h>
 +#include <asm/pgalloc.h>
we do not want to put #ifdef CONFIG_X86-type of stuff into the main
kernel.
basically there are some 'low level' include files that need low-level
paging details, but do not have the highlevel structures defined like
struct mm. So i've split out all the highlevel code from pgtable.h (TLB
flushing and page table allocation) and have put it into pgalloc.h.
pgalloc.h includes pgtable.h.

fallback from 'highmem => normalmem => dmamem' should work already.

will have a look - i think we are simply out of balance somewhere, but
maybe it's something else. What i saw on 16MB is that kswapd is almost
constantly running, but process pages do get allocated in the lowest 16MB
as well.
