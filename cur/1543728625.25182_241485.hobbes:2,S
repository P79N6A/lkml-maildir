Speaking of clean, is there something like the XFS freeze for ext? I know
freezing XFS is pretty dangerous (swap, temp, root) so I think it is not
useable on all devices anyway.

I did that for XFS some time ago, but the parameters where all hardcoded. I
used the freeze command. Do you think one can skip that for ext3?
