Yes, But you require Adam Belay's new PnP patches and an additional patch to 
fix an oops problem ;-) 
I think Adam will have those patches on lkml soon. If you can't find any of 
the patches, I can send them. I'm testing the PnP bug fixes as we speak so 
I'll do some sanity checking to see if they work right.
The sound blaster patches are from Paul and you can find them on lkml about 
1-2 weeks ago.
Shawn.
