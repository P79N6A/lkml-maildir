I added "sb=0x220,7,1,5" now, and it seems to work (I got music). Got this
is startup:
Soundblaster audio driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
nothing more. Why doesn't it report the port and irq/dma anymore?
Only have 1 question left. Where is the option to set the MPU's port now?
I'd still prefer those things compiled in tho, I'll use modules if I want
