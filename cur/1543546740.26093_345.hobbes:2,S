Your guess is correct. Actually the 10 Mbps part is temporary, as my
100Mbps hub doesnt seem to be working reliably. I wouldn't call it
busy, although for 10Mbps it might be. There are only three nodes on
the network and only two of them actually exchange significant amounts
of data.

I am glad I am the network admin here. If I wasn't, I would probably
be in big trouble. Pingflooding my workstation from the network server
is usually not a good idea. The mistake I made was initiating the ping
over SSH from the workstation (with the buggy kernel), so as soon as
packets started arriving the machine dropped off the net with Tx
errors as you predicted and I had no way to stop the pings from the
server. My stupid mistake was rebooting into 2.4.0-test7 instead of
one with a reliable NIC driver :). As soon as the interface was
brought up the pings killed it. I booted a 2.2 kernel, sshed in and
killed the ping process.

It seems to work!!! When trying to ping my machine madly as you
described above, I get "Transmit timed out" errors every 10-20 seconds
but they appear to be legitimate -- the network still operates and the
machine nothing seems to be affected.
Thanks so much for helping me out with this. I hope you can help
countless other people too by getting the right people to include a
fix in 2.4.
