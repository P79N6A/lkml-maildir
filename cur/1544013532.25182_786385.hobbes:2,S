Probably the best way to proceed would be for the stakeholders to come to some
agreement on which parts are the "sane stuff" (which could be an interesting
food fight), split those parts out, and submit them for inclusion as standalone

It's a shame that the grsecurity developers had issues with the LSM architecture,
as their RBAC would probably be a nice addition to the slowly-growing set of
LSM modules.
