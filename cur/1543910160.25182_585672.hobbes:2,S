Actually, I deal with that in LTTng by having a module that verifies
synchronicity of TSCs across CPUs and, if it's over a certain threshold,
falls back to a sophisticated logical clock (actually, it is a mix of
the TSC of the cpu with highest count and a logical clock) and prints a
printk informing the user of the inaccuracy. I also provide suggestions
on my website of what kernel features must be disabled by users to get
precise timestamps (idle=poll, disable frequency scaling) ans what the
limitations are on Intel and AMD models.
It is packed in a lttng-timestamp-* patchset which I plan to eventually
post for review.
It also provides an architecture independent timestamp read consisting
in jiffies or'd with a logical clock. No locking is required by the
reader (no read reqlock at all). This type of clock could be considered
as "always monotonically increasing", which is the basic condition
required to have a meaningful trace.
