Thanks, for confirming this!  And I agree that this patch and 2.6 offer an 
important and necessary workaround to inhibit OOM-killer, but it's no more 
than a workaround.
And so the question remains:  Why should overcommit come into play at all 
when dealing with physical RAM only?
Shouldn't it be possible to disable overcommit completely, thus giving kswapd 
a break from running wild trying to find something to swap/page, which is 
the reason why the system gets unstable going over 95% in your example.
Thanks!
