more info, if I create a new file and write some data to it I can read it 
back ok, but if I umount/mount fs again then that file's data is filled 
with zeroes but metadata is read correctly.
Besides, I am looking at the rd_request() and it looks like a joke:
        if (CURRENT->cmd == READ)
                memset(CURRENT->buffer, 0, len);
        else
                set_bit(BH_Protected, &CURRENT->bh->b_state);
how can it possibly be so simple - where is the actual io? On the other 
hand, it is the same in 2.2.x and 2.2.12 works fine.
Still looking....
Tigran.
