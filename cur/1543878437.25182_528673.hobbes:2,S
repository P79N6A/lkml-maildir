We do this because, although the underlying clock is 16MHz, the DIOR
and DIOW signals go through a bit of logic and are not synchronised
to this clock.
As explained in the comments above:

The figures outside the brackets are the documented timings on the host
bus, but these are not what the drive sees.  The timings which the drive
sees are those in brackets.
The timings the drive sees clearly are not based upon a 16MHz clock
period.  Therefore, I'd prefer to get the nanoseconds from the
calculation and work from that.

Obviously I can demonstrate a bug. 8)
Lets say that we want to do MW DMA mode 2.  This has the minimum timing
of 70ns active, 25ns recovery, 120ns cycle time.
When you quantise those figures using a clock period of 62.5ns (16MHz)
you end up with: 2 clocks active (2*62.5 > 70), 1 clock recovery
(1*62.5 > 25) and 2 clocks cycle (2*62.5 > 120).
Last time I checked, active + recovery must always be equal to the cycle
time, and unless my math is failing me, 2 + 1 does not equal 2.
It's quite obvious that returning the active time _equal_ to the cycle
time is even more utterly bogus - that means you're asking for the signal
to remain active for the entire cycle without any recovery.
So, you probably need to incorporate that logic from pata_icside into the
libata core.
