I'm unsure whether we saw this problem before or not but it does sound familiar. First I 
would like to ask you to check your motherboards vendor website for a possible BIOS 
update for your motherboard. The 82566DM chipsets are rather new and we have pushed out 
NVM changes to vendors for some known issues.

unfortunately that doesn't say that much. I do know that we are queueing some ich8/82566 
changes for the kernel and if you're willing to try them I can provide patch to the 
kernel netdev tree to you (it was posted here 3 days ago) to try.
