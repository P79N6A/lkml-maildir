Subject: New 2.6 port: why would kernel not start /sbin/init?

I've got a port to a new chip (ARM920 core) that is very close to
booting.  There appears to be something keeping the /sbin/init process
from starting.
In this setup, I'm running a patched 2.6.2 kernel from flash memory.
The root filesystem is a JFFS2 partition in flash.  The
run_init_process() call appears to succeed because it doesn't return.
The sysrq-task list shows that there is an init task, but there seems
to be something wrong with the stack.

I've traced through the elf binary loader and gotten to the point
where it does a start_thread().  The only odd thing I see is that that
the interpreter, elf_entry=0x400015f0, refers to an address that
doesn't appear to have any code there.  (I'm using gdb to debug the
kernel through a JTAG emulator.)
(gdb) x/20 elf_entry
0x400015f0:     0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x40001600:     0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x40001610:     0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x40001620:     0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
0x40001630:     0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
My hardware debugger complains of a 'data abort' when I look at that
address which usually means that the CPU returned a page fault.
Should I expect that these pages be mapped already?  Can you offer any
suggestions as to where in the kernel to look for this kind of
failure?
Cheers.
