That sounds correct. On x86, BogoMips these days is just a measure of how 
fast the timestamp counter goes (multiplied by two for totally bogus 
reasons), and a Pentium-M should have a fixed-frequency TSC that ticks at 
the highest possible frequency of the CPU, regardless of what the real 
frequency is.
So your BogoMips of 3730 sounds correct.

No, this is the _right_ bogomips value. Since the TSC is fixed-frequency, 
bogomips doesn't change with CPU frequency.

Yeah, looks like cpufreq has (totally incorrectly) scaled up the bogomips 
value.
The scaling up should actually happen if the TSC runs at core speed _or_ 
if bogomips is calculated using the old "decl + jne" loop. So I guess 
somebody "fixed" a bug that was a bug on such systems, and broke systems 
with a proper fixed-frequency TSC.
DaveJ, does this ring any bells?
