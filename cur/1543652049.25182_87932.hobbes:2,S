Hello Richard,
As I said earlier, I did not have time to look at the patch today, but
I was going to save it with some other alpha kernel patches and
was going to look at it next week.  From the snippet of code that
you included in this e-mail, I agree 100% with your analysis of this
patch and the correct way to proceed.  I would not want you to
apply such a jumbo patch.
Today we were mostly absorbed in discussing where  or too whom
should Thorsten send the patch instead of the patch itself, since
there is no maintainer in the MAINTAINERS file.
Thank you very much for taking the time to review and consider
this patch.
Best Regards,
--George
