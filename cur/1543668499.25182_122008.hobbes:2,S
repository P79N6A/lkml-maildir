genksyms assumes and requires valid C code as input.  genksyms does not
attempt to validate the source, that is the job of gcc.  If gcc barfs
on the code, then do not attempt to run it through genksyms.  This
looks like a chicken and egg problem but is not, compile with
MODVERSIONS=n to verify that new code is valid before building with
MODVERSIONS=y.  To put it another way, do not run modversions on test
kernels.
