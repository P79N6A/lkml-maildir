Only with CONFIG_X86_GENERIC.  That's precisely why CONFIG_X86_GENERIC 
was created.
If I disabled CONFIG_X86_GENERIC and select CONFIG_MPENTIUM4, I darned 
well better not get any Athlon code.  The cpu setup code in particular I 
want to conditionalize, and there are other bits that need work... but 
for the most part it works as intended.
