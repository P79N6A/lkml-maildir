Hi,
I am getting the following error message as part of stack trace. 
I have a system with > 4G mem with RHEL4 x86_64. I installed the OS
and when I did the reboot, the system failed with a stack trace with
errors as follows:
Intializing hardware.....
kernel BUG at pageattr:107
Invalid operand:0000 [1] SMP
Modules linked in: hw_random tg3 floppy sd_mod aic79xx(U) scsi_mod
dm_snapshot dm_zero dm_mirror ext3 jbd dm_mod
pid: 1217,comm:modprobe....

RIP ...{__change_page_attr+1039}
/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit: line 167: 1217 Segmentation fault modprobe $1
>/dev/null 2>&1
I wanted to know if aic79xx driver is having some problems or is it
kernel/scsi subsystem. I don't see the stack trace pointing to aic79xx
driver at all.
Also, the above issue is only for > 4G mem.
Thanks in advance for the help.
with regards,
   Anil
