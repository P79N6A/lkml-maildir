Could this be a cabling problem ? I think this is what happening to me..
I have scsi cd-rw (yamaha 4416s) and my scsi controller (sym 810a) doesn't
have active terminator (only passive). 
So I can record fine - but when I try to read 
(like using dd if=/dev/cdrom | md5sum ) I get errors. (I checked that
recording is ok by using cd driver on another computer). Windows cannot
read big files too.
