I can sympathise with the opinion that linux should be able to accurately
distinguish xx:59:60 when a leap second is added (or the missing :59 when
one is subtracted) but not at the expense of making a day which is not
86400 seconds long.
To fix the problem would require accurately modeling international
timekeeping standards such as TAI and use of different syscalls to
return time in TAI and UTC-with-leap-seconds represented. It
wouldn't be good to change the semantics of time().

Arguably the kernel's responsibility should be to keep track of the
most fundamental representation of time possible for a machine (that's
probably TAI) and it is a userspace responsibility to map from that
value to other time standards including UTC, using control files
which are updated as leap seconds are declared. Just so long as the
existing behaviour of time() which doesn't recognise leap seconds
is preserved.
