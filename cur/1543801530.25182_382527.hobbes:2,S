Ok, so if you have large numbers of CPU's and large page sizes it's not 
useful. however, what about a 2-4 cpu machine with 4k page 
sizes, 8-32G of ram (a not unreasonable Opteron system config) that will 
be running 5,000-20,000 processes/threads?
I know people argue that programs that do such things are bad (and I 
definantly agree that they aren't optimized), but the reality is that some 
workloads are like that. if a machine is being built for such uses 
configuring the kernel to better tolorate such use may be useful
