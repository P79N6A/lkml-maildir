Choke, gag.
There are uid namespace issues but since no one has finished the
uid namespace that I am aware of that is minor.
However the code does not appear clean/maintainable.  The normal linux
signal sending policy has already been enforce before we get to this
point.
So unless I am totally mistaken the code should read:
int cap_task_kill(struct task_struct *p, struct siginfo *info,
                                int sig, u32 secid)
{
        if (info != SEND_SIG_NOINFO && (is_si_special(info) || SI_FROMKERNEL(info)))
                return 0;
        if (!cap_issubset(p->cap_permitted, current->cap_permitted))
                return -EPERM;
	return 0;
}
Although doing it that way violates:
       /*
         * Running a setuid root program raises your capabilities.
         * Killing your own setuid root processes was previously
         * allowed.
         * We must preserve legacy signal behavior in this case.
         */
Which says to me the code should really read:
int cap_task_kill(struct task_struct *p, struct siginfo *info,
                                int sig, u32 secid)
{
	return 0;
}
The entire point of defining cap_task_kill under
CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABLITIES appears to be deny killing processes
with more caps.  Killing processes that we could ordinarily kill 
which have more caps appears to be precisely the case we have decided
to allow.  So the patched version of cap_task_kill appears to be an
expensive way of doing nothing, just waiting for someone to complain
about the last couple of cases it denies until it is truly a noop.

So it looks to me like we should just give up trying to deny a few
cases now.
