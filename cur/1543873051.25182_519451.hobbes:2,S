Which is a questionable assumption.  Worse case we are talking a list
several thousand entries long, and generally if you are used by the same
container you will hit one of your processes long before you traverse
the whole list.
So at least the average case performance should be good.
It is only in the case when you a page is shared between multiple
containers when this matters.
