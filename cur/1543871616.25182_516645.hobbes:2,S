It does not.  That patch has regset and ptrace stuff in it.  It indeed
applies fine before or after utrace patches.  But it doesn't close to
compile without utrace-regset.patch and utrace-core.patch applied,
and even with utrace-ptrace-compat.patch it still doesn't compile for me
with a lot of complaints about TIF_SINGLESTEP not being defined where
it's used in asm/tracehook.h.
Thanks,
Roland
