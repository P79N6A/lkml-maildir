It happens when a packet to a host outside 130.89.*.* is routed through
the eth1 (130.89.203.37) interface. That happens with any traffic not
from .9.11 or .9.13. .9.11 and .9.13 don't have any problems, their
traffic is routed to the other Internet interface without any problems.
Also, traffic to 130.89.*.* from any host is routed to eth1 correctly
and "even" works.
So, in short:
192.168.9.10 -=> 130.89.1.1 works, through eth1
192.168.9.11 -=> 130.89.1.1 works, through eth1
192.168.9.10 -=> www.google.com doesn't work
192.168.9.11 -=> www.google.com works, through hensema (which is what I want)
Also, trying to ping www.google.com through eth1 (hensema is the default
interface) from the bugging machine directly works.
I hope this clarifies something... If not, I can do some more testing
tomorrow.
