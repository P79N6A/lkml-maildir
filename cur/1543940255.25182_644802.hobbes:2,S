If they're only required for building blackfin debugging stuff, that 
shouldn't be a big deal. People building embedded kernels with debugging 
from source can probably handle the extra requirement. Setting up a 
cross-compilation toolchain for embedded processors is much trickier than 
getting xml tools.

If it's a bunch of smaller files, and if changes tend to be localized, 
that would be a good tradeoff. Alternatively, have them packaged 
separately, which might be more appropriate anyway if people might want to 
use them for other purposes (on the host when using jtag, perhaps).
