Well,
* if the userland interface is 100% sending cdbs or taskfiles, then I
would prefer that Jens Axboe's "bsg" be used.  Its a chardev interface
for sending/receiving commands to a request queue.
* otherwise, I would pick either chrdev or sysfs.  if you gotta support
2.4, I guess that means chrdev.

libata and all its drivers work on RHEL2.1 (2.4.9), and someone is
even crazy enough to be porting libata to 2.2.x ;-)
