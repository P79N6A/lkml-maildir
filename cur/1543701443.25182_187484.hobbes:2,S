Season's Greetings.
`make modules` should be run as a user; only `make modules_install` need
be run as root.
To fix the problem, I would try adding '#include <asm/termbits.h>'
to the top of 'drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c'.  Probably this has never
before been compiled with your hardware configuration.
