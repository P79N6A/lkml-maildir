But I don't want an initrd.  I want to get the root fs directly from
disk the way I always have.  Initrd may be useful for install floppies
and such, not something I want for an ordinary installed system.
The kernel parameter way is better, just add to lilo.conf
and it works.  Forcing an initrd is also incompatibility,
because I don't use one now.
