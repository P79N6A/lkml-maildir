What are these arguments achieving? I love the fact everyone is an individual 
as it does create innovation in its own right, but its also causing waste too 
when it gets out of hand. But its probably always been like that to some 
extent here. VM issue seems to be out of hand (I know its complex).
What features do each of the VM's possess? Maybe it should be listed out with 
negatives and positives so even someone who really is not a programmer can 
understand it. 
Why are we up to 2.4.17 already? Is it mainly this VM issue?

PS Alan, good luck to Wales in the upcoming six nations.
