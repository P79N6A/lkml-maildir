Sorry if I'm being redundant
I spent a lot of time looking for it, and did 
not find, so I came here for help
Perhaps anyone can help me, or point me to the 
right place to ask
I did not yet fully understand how sysfs works, 
and so, any docs would be welcome
My main problem is: 
I'm trying to use udev, but some devices for
drivers that are compiled in the kernel does
not appear in. I searched for entries 
representing then in /sys, and found no one
Specifically, no pts is found there
in my .config, I have CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y
What can I do in order to solve this problem?
Thanks in advance
glauber
