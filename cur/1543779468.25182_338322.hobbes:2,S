the right solution would be to mark policy->lock as a compat_semaphore.  
That will revert things back to the stock semantics. (at the price of 
not having PI, which isnt a big issue in this case.)

the reason for not allowing init_MUTEX_LOCKED() is that in basically 
every case that does it, the semaphore is not used as a true mutex in 
the strict sense. So the affected semaphore should be changed to 
compat_semaphore, to gain full semantics.
