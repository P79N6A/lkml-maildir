Though surely the reality will be that after your system is up for a 
while, and is thorougly fragmented, your latency becomes frigging horrible 
for most allocs though? You risk writing a crapload of pages out to disk
for every alloc ...

but it's vastly different order of magnitude than touching disk.
Can we not do a "sniff alloc" first (ie if this is easy, give it
to me, else just fail and return w/o reclaim), then fall back to
smaller allocs? Though I suspect the reality is that on any real
system, a order 4 alloc will never actually succeed in any sensible
amount of time anyway? Perhaps us lot just reboot too often ;-)
