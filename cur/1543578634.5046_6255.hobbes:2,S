As I tested devfsd dies after I'm logging out (very often on P200MMX,
much more seldom on P3 700). I suspect some devfs related race

I tries 2.4.1-pre3 and got the same. Modifying devfsd.c to retry stating
some times before giving up workarounds the problem (As far as I tested 
I'm getting only one retry ...)
Perhaps it's kernel's bug anyway, but I think it's doesn't harm to make
devfsd slightly more errorproof. I'm including patch for devfsd (I had also 
to define __USE_GNU to get devfsd compile with glibc-2.2 at all ...)
Of course best solution would be to fix the race itself (it appeared sometimes
between 2.4.0-test10 and 2.4.0-test12, first one is OK) ....
