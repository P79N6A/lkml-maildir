don't forget that the kbuild2.5 patch was a lot smaller before keith was
told to "go away and don't bother anyone until the speed problem is fixed"
a large part of the fix was to use the mmapped db stuff that Larry McVoy
made available instead of useing the standard db libraries on the system.
one possible way to make this more 'incramental' would be to make a
version of kbuild2.5 that used the standard db stuff and is 200% slower
then the existing kbuild and then after it's accepted put in the patch to
speed it up to where it's 17% faster (IIRC the numbers Daniel posted
earlier today) by converting the db that's used. Somehow I doubt that
crippling the speed mearly to make it 'incramental' would make many people
happy.
