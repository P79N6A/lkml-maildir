Not everything in drivers/ is suitable for every ARM configuration.  It
was felt at the time better for ARM to remain separate because people
didn't want to pollute drivers/Kconfig with the ARM specific conditionals.
(mtd is conditional because it's not supported on ARM CPUs without
alignment trap support.)
