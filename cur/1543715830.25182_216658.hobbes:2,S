We already have a message when it's loading, and a message on unload is
superfluous - if I insmod the NVidia driver and then unload it, the kernel is
still tainted by it, because it had a chance to mangle memory while it was
loaded.
And yes, sometimes the damage can be hiding for a LONG time - I know I've seen
bug reports on the list that involved "module A dorked a pointer which wasn't
noticed for 3 days until module B  tried to...."
Would the attached strawman patch make people happ(y|ier)?
