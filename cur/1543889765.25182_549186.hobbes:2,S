I don't think the "hard part" exists at all.
1. There are only a handful of PATA devices which raise IRQ too early.
For native SATA devices, it's much more difficult to get it wrong if you
consider the SATA non-data and PIO transport protocol.  For PATA devices
bridged to SATA, again, there's nothing much we can do.  The bridge
implements HSM and would send D2H Reg FIS on command completion IRQ.  If
the PATA shows incorrect register values at that stage, well, that's it.
3. Intelligent controllers such as AHCI and sil24 implement some part of
HSM in the silicon.  sil24 implements most of it, ahci a bit less, but,
even for ahci, the too early interrupt can trigger internal HSM failure.
 I don't think we can do much in such cases.  sil24 doesn't even update
the TF area if command is not in progress.  In the intelligent
controllers, the problem polling SETXFER tries to solve is in lower
layer than OS driver.
So, I don't think the problem exists for SATA in the first place.  At
least there hasn't been any report of it and doing SETXFER by polling
can handle all the existing cases.  We can and probably should deal with
such SATA devices when and if they come up.  How are we gonna verify the
controller doesn't crap itself and ahci TF register monitoring HSM can
work around the weirdo when we don't have any such device?  Even if we
determine that we need to do HSM over intelligent SATA controller now, I
think we still need to push polling SETXFER first to take care of the
existing cases.
Thanks.
