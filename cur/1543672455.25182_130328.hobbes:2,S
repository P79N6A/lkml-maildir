Subject: [RFC][Patch] fix for irq_affinity_write_proc v2.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
  irq_affinity_write_proc currently directly calls set_ioapic_affinity
which writes to the ioapic.  This undermines the work done by kirqd by
writing a cpu mask directly to the ioapic. I propose the following patch
to tie the /proc affinity writes into the same code path as kirqd. 
Kirqd will enforce the affinity requested by the user.
