and no "BUG: foo:1234 waking up bar:4321, expiring ktimer short" message 
prior to that? Very weird, this line:

suggests that the ktimer was expired by ktimer_try_to_cancel() / 
ktimer_cancel(), in ktimer_schedule(). I.e. something must have woken 
the task early. Probably this theory of mine is incorrect then. I'll try 
extend the debug info a bit: it would be interesting to see a 'timer 
inserted at' timestamp as well (was it shortly before the problem 
happened?), and a 'which PID cancelled the timer' info.
a heavy-hitting but complex-to-set-up solution would be to add a serial 
console, and to enable WAKEUP_TIMING+LATENCY_TRACING in the .config, and 
to edit kernel/latency.c to initialize the default value of the 
following variables:
int wakeup_timing = 0;
int trace_all_cpus = 1;
int trace_freerunning = 1;
int trace_print_at_crash = 1;
int trace_user_triggered = 1;
these variables are in the top portion of latency.c. Important: if you 
try this then you should probably also enable IGNORE_PRINTK_LOGLEVEL, 
which will improve mass-output to the serial console. Another important 
thing is to add a stop_trace() call to kernel/ktimers.c's 
check_ktimer_signal() function:
        unlock_ktimer_base(timer, &flags);
        stop_trace();
        printk("BUG: ktimer expired short without user signal! (%s:%d)\n",
                current->comm, current->pid);
(otherwise all the trace output you'd be getting would be boring printk 
related trace entries.)
this will cause the dump_stack() to also output thousands of trace 
entries - all the kernel activity (from all CPUs) that preceded the 
ktimer problem. Hopefully this pinpoints the bug.

would it be easy for you to try the UP kernel? One possibility is that 
this is some sort of SMP/APIC-timer related problem.
