OK, it seems in my case it's triggered by the initialization of the X
"s3virge" driver (for my s3 virge/dx pci card).
It doesn't occur when using "vga" nor when switching ttys.
Starting X with s3virge seems to be the only way to trigger it on my
system.
i'm not very familiar with those problems, i only know that resetting the
timer keeps my system clock from going mad.
