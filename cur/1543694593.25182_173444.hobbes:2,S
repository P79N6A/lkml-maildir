In 2.6.0-test8 hibernation via "echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep" works incredibly 
well from the console. Great work! I tested it many times and it seems quite 
stable.
However, it fails when X is running (even if doing chvt before suspension). 
I followed your advice and removed the video card modules (intel-agp and 
i830). Indeed, when booting without those modules, suspend to disk 
miraculously works from X; I was even able to hibernate from within a KDE 
session and restore to that point exactly.
I am not sure which of the two modules causes the problem, I can only load 
them both. Unfortunately, without those modules the vaio laptop can only give 
640x480, so this is not much of a workaround...
To summarize:
If the intel-agp and i830 modules are not loaded during startup, suspend via 
echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep and restore work beautifully. If those modules 
_are_ loaded, and X is running, resume reboots.
