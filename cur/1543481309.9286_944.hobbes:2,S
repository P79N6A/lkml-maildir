Since the ioctl()'s are implemented all over the place (in the driver,
in a 3rd-party module, etc...), the documentation is similarly fragmented.
It might be a good idea to document all of the ioctl()'s that are implemented
somewhere in the standard kernel in a documentation repository included in
the kernel source.
The only difficulty with the latter idea that I know of is that some of the
documentation work will overlap with the standard man pages packages and in
some ways greatly overlap with the C libraries.  AFAIK this is fairly minor.
