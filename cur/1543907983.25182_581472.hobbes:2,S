Momentarily I'll be posting a patchset that makes all atomic_t and atomic64_t 
declarations non-volatile, and casts them to volatile inside of atomic[64]_read. 
  This will ensure consistent behavior across all architectures, and is in 
keeping with the philosophy that memory reads should be enforced in running 
code, not declarations.
I hope you don't mind that we're mooting the question by making the code more 
sensible.
