Very well; it is not prescribed in the standard and it is non-portable. 
Our code is broken and we will fix it.
But even Dave Butenhof, Mr. Pthreads himself, has said it is reasonable 
to expect sched_yield to yield the CPU. That's what pthread_yield did in 
Pthreads Draft 4 (DCE threads) and it is common knowledge that 
sched_yield is a direct replacement for pthread_yield; i.e., 
pthread_yield() was deleted from the spec because sched_yield fulfilled 
its purpose. Now you're saying "well, technically, sched_yield doesn't 
have to do anything at all" and the letter of the spec supports your 
position, but anybody who's been programming with pthreads since the DCE 
days "knows" that is not the original intention. I wonder that nobody 
has decided to raise this issue with the IEEE/POSIX group and get them 
to issue a correction/clarification in all this time, since the absence 
of specification here really impairs the usefulness of the spec.
Likewise the fact that sched_yield() can now cause the current process 
to be queued behind other processes seems suspect, unless we know for 
sure that the threads are running with PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM. (I haven't 
checked to see if PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS is still supported in NPTL.)
