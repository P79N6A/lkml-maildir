Subject: [PATCH 00/15] Remove asm/segment.h from low hanging architectures
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/24/142

The following set of patches removes the use and existence of 
asm/segment.h from the architecture ports that it was fairly trivial to do 
so.  I need to work with the arch maintainers on the following 
architectures since they use asm/segment.h heavily:
m32r
um
frv
h8300
i386
m68knommu
m68k
v850
x86_64
If any arch maintainers want to go a head kill asm/segment.h in that last 
I would be very appreciative.
Thanks
