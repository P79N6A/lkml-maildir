Clue aquired; I now have a working lcall27 handler, along with a more intimate
knowledge of the Intel Architecture than I ever expected or wanted. 
My Solaris 'hello world' now runs. To get the dynamically linked version to 
run, I had to modify the behaviour of ibcs_mmap(). Currently, it returns zero 
if a MAP_FIXED mmap() call succeeds - but Solaris' ld.so expects it to return
<addr>, just like Linux does.
What systems require this behaviour? Do we need add PER_SOLARIS to distinguish 
between them? We could separate the lcall7 handler from the lcall27 handler 
and set current->personality to PER_SOLARIS iff the latter is called. (We 
might already need to have separate handlers anyway - I assume they changed 
for a reason.)
