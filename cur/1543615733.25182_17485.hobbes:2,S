That's partly true.
In old P1 PC I have SVGA and Hercules card with Xfree 3.3.6
svga on tty1-tty10
hercules on tty12-tty22
you can have two consoles simultanious and are working,
you also can have for example top on hercules and
be in X's at the same time, but when you go to active console
on hercules you lose X on svga.
The best what can be done you can have X on hercules
and X on svga, but is totally unuseable.
With Xfree 4 none of this is not useable :(
you can have two consoles like top on hercules and working on swga
but if you "turn X on" you can have top on hercules
but when you go to X you got blank screen on hercules.
It is X fault (works with Xfree 3.3.6- but not with 4+)
probably the best solution is VT terminal atached to
serial or usb on serial convertor.
or cheap 386+ on lan :(

Zoran
