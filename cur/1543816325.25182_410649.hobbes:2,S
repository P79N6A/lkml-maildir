well, while /proc/mounts is a good example that it 'works'
it isn't a good example for proper design, as the entire
private namespaces lead to much obfuscation, and having
the mounts per process, where they actually should be per
namespace, and to hide the fact that there are different
namespaces does not help either ...
IMHO a much better design would be to have the namespace
'explicit' and link to that one, containig the mounts entry
btw, this is something which should still be possible
without breaking anything ...

why?
/proc/self -> YYY/
/proc/mounts -> self/mounts
(so far nothing new)
/proc/YYY/namespace -> ../namespace-XXX/
/proc/YYY/mounts -> namespace/mounts 
(or alternatively)
/proc/namespace -> namespace-XXX/
/proc/mounts -> namespace/mounts

I don't see any differences regarding compatibility when
things like namespaces get explicit ...
