Now I'm having second thoughts.  Sigh ;-)
My intended design was that sysfs would copy to/from buffer + offset
rather than buffer.  Seems that change 1.6 to this file (hm, bkweb seems
broken at the moment?) changed that.  so that broke my pci-sysfs changes
which weren't in the tree at the time.
It probably makes more sense to copy to/from buffer rather than
buffer+offset so we can implement larger sized binary files (we can use
a smaller buffer than the size of the file and do multiple read/write
calls).
So I think I'd like to hold off on this patchset, not change sysfs and
adapt my changes to the new API (which I didn't even know had changed.
grr.)
