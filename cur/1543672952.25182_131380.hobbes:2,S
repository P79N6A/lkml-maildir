If your program is capable of handling an address with more than 32 
bits, what point is there giving a hint?  Either your program can handle 
64-bit pointers or it cannot.  Any program flexible enough to handle 
either size dynamically would expend enough overhead checking that it 
would be worse than if it just made a hard choice.
