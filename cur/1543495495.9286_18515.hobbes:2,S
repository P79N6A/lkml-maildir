Hi there.
 >> I just "stumbled" across linux-2.3.0.tar.bz2. So what's in it?? :)
 > Same as in 2.2.8.
In that case, why does 2.2.8 and 2.3.0 have different sizes, and
different times for the most recently modified file therein?
Courtesy my Linux Kernel Versions list:
 Q> 11,212,277 Tue 11 May 1999 18:37 linux-2.2.8.tar.bz2
 Q> 11,208,792 Tue 11 May 1999 21:05 linux-2.3.0.tar.bz2
Note that the 2.3.0 archive is some 3.5k smaller than the 2.2.8 one,
and also has at least one file that was updated over 2 hours later
than any file in the 2.2.8 archive...
Best wishes from Riley.
