It depends on if the file extention, or perhaps even the results
of a 'file' command registers a configured file association, as
well as the permissions on the file, and the filesystem that it
resides on.  DOS files for example always show as rwxr-xr-x and
you have to mount with a different umask to be able to view FAT
filesystems easily.
They'll likely fix it sometime...
