I want to start from scratch because I am trying a different angle, and I don't understand
fully current projects on it.  I am not trying to discredit anyone.  In fact, I would hope that
the existing implimentation (different as it is) would manage to get itself in as well.
Remember, modularity is all about options. Options aren't just "Do you want this or
that?", but also "How do you want this or that done?"  Plus, I am not compressing the
page cache, assuming I understand what this means.  AFAIK (from others' help), the
page cache is a cached copy of pages that have gone to the swap recently, or been
pulled off recently.  I am not touching that.
Other things (not brought up by me) include making a central compression library for the
kernel (modular, i.e. modprobe zlib and such) (Jorn's idea).  That is something that I think
would be essential for swap compression; why should one module horde all the compression
algo's?
