So you are particularly interested in more general "qualifiers" 
(in posix acl entry speak:).
Some people are also interested in more general "permissions" for ACEs.
Could this not be catered for independent of the proposed EA interface
for getting/setting/removing EAs ?
One could come up with more general data structures and functions
for ACLs/ACEs than what we currently propose, 
and yet still use the same EA interface.
