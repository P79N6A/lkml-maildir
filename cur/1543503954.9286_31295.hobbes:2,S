From my reading of the patch, it only affects processes running with a
priority of SCHED_IDLE. I intended to propose that even SCHED_OTHER
processes could get promoted.
Getting the penalty right so it is neither exploitable nor too harsh
might be hard though. Being too harsh to a SCHED_IDLE process isn't a
problem -- we are already as harsh as possible to them.
