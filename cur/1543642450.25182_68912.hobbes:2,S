You told me, but I'm far from convinced this is the problem. I think
it's more likely this is a side-effect of a server issue - something
like a lot of dropped packets and retransmits, though not necessarily
that.

Hmmm ... if you change something on the server, and all the clients
go wild, I'm suspicious of whatever you did to the server. You need
to have a lot more data before leaping to the conclusion that it's
because the specweb client code is crap.
Troy - I think your UP clients weren't anywhere near maxed out on 
CPU power, right? Can you take a peek at the clients under NAPI load?
Dave - did you ever try running 4 specweb clients bound to each of
the 4 CPUs in an attempt to make the clients scale better? I'm 
suspicious that you're maxing out 4 4-way machines, and Troy's
16 UPs are cruising along just fine.
