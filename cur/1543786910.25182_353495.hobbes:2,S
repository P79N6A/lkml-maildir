Subject: [PATCH] fixup bogus e820 entry with mem=
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This was reported because someone was getting oopses
reading /proc/iomem.  It was tracked down to a zero-sized 'struct
resource' entry which was located right at 4GB.  
You need two conditions to hit this bug: a BIOS E820_RAM area starting
at exactly the boundary where you specify mem= (to get a zero-sized
entry), and for the legacy_init_iomem_resources() loop to skip  that
resource (which only happens at exactly 4G).
I think the killing zero-sized e820 entry is the easiest way to fix
this.
