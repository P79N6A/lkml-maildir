+NON-MEMORY
+
+A new feature for EDAC, the edac_device class of device, was added in
+the 2.6.23 version of the kernel.
+
+This new device type allows for non-memory type of ECC hardware detectors
+to have their states harvested and presented to userspace via the sysfs
+interface.
+
+Some architectures have ECC detectors for L1, L2 and L3 caches, along with DMA
+engines, fabric switches, main data path switches, interconnections,
+and various other hardware data paths. If the hardware reports it, then
+a edac_device device probably can be constructed to harvest and present
+that to userspace.
+
+
+PCI BUS SCANNING
 
 In addition, PCI Bus Parity and SERR Errors are scanned for on PCI devices
 in order to determine if errors are occurring on data transfers.

 The presence of PCI Parity errors must be examined with a grain of salt.
 There are several add-in adapters that do NOT follow the PCI specification

+EDAC_DEVICE type of device
+
+In the header file, edac_core.h, there is a series of edac_device structures
+and APIs for the EDAC_DEVICE.
+
+User space access to an edac_device is through the sysfs interface.
+
+At the location /sys/devices/system/edac (sysfs) new edac_device devices will
+appear.
+
+There is a three level tree beneath the above 'edac' directory. For example,
+the 'test_device_edac' device (found at the bluesmoke.sourceforget.net website)
+installs itself as:
+
+	/sys/devices/systm/edac/test-instance
+
+in this directory are various controls, a symlink and one or more 'instance'
+directorys.
+
+The standard default controls are:
+
+	log_ce		boolean to log CE events
+	log_ue		boolean to log UE events
+	panic_on_ue	boolean to 'panic' the system if an UE is encountered
+			(default off, can be set true via startup script)
+	poll_msec	time period between POLL cycles for events
+
+The test_device_edac device adds at least one of its own custom control:
+
+	test_bits	which in the current test driver does nothing but
+			show how it is installed. A ported driver can
+			add one or more such controls and/or attributes
+			for specific uses.
+			One out-of-tree driver uses controls here to allow
+			for ERROR INJECTION operations to hardware
+			injection registers
+
+The symlink points to the 'struct dev' that is registered for this edac_device.
+
+INSTANCES
+
+One or more instance directories are present. For the 'test_device_edac' case:
+
+	test-instance0
+
+
+In this directory there are two default counter attributes, which are totals of
+counter in deeper subdirectories.
+
+	ce_count	total of CE events of subdirectories
+	ue_count	total of UE events of subdirectories
+
+BLOCKS
+
+At the lowest directory level is the 'block' directory. There can be 0, 1
+or more blocks specified in each instance.
+
+	test-block0
+
+
+In this directory the default attributes are:
+
+	ce_count	which is counter of CE events for this 'block'
+			of hardware being monitored
+	ue_count	which is counter of UE events for this 'block'
+			of hardware being monitored
+
+
+The 'test_device_edac' device adds 4 attributes and 1 control:
+
+	test-block-bits-0	for every POLL cycle this counter
+				is incremented
+	test-block-bits-1	every 10 cycles, this counter is bumped once,
+				and test-block-bits-0 is set to 0
+	test-block-bits-2	every 100 cycles, this counter is bumped once,
+				and test-block-bits-1 is set to 0
+	test-block-bits-3	every 1000 cycles, this counter is bumped once,
+				and test-block-bits-2 is set to 0
+
+
+	reset-counters		writing ANY thing to this control will
+				reset all the above counters.
+
+
+Use of the 'test_device_edac' driver should any others to create their own
+unique drivers for their hardware systems.
+
+The 'test_device_edac' sample driver is located at the
+bluesmoke.sourceforge.net project site for EDAC.
