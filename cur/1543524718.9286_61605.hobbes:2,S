I'd be willing to do so, except for the fact that I have very little
experience with tweaking code at that level of complexity. I have
tweaked the patch against 2.2.13 to patch cleanly against 2.2.14, and
would love to see that included into the 2.2 series so that the code
can get some more exposure, but that's unlikely as I understand it.

The alternative would be for the fs drivers to include two extra
function pointers, one to preprocess a file being read, the other to
preprocess a file being written, with a NULL value for those pointers
(the default) resulting in the data being passed straight through.

Can you also comment on the above suggestion?
Best wishes from Riley.
