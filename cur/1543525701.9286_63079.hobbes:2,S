I'm running 2.2.14 now, and it's "better".  I still get random character
insertions, but much less frequently.  With 2.3 it would happen every few
words; with 2.2.14 it has only happened once so far (I pressed space twice
but got " ' ".
Perhaps it's just a loose connection somewhere.  Hmm.  It's a Packard Bell
keyboard.  Ah -- I pressed shift just then and although I let go it seemed
like there was no 'key up' (everything came out like I still had shift
pressed down).
Tim.
