Thanks for your reply.
I have an idea what you're talking about, but no more i'm afraid.
I'm no programmer and i don't know how to try what you suggested.
What i did try was applying some patches manually that i found in the 
mailing list archives.
This is one of them:

The other just put a "udelay(1)" on line 1999 of sunhme.c.
With the udelay(1) it seemed like after a reboot it would take longer 
for the timeout to happen. The other made no difference.
Very thankful for your time.
