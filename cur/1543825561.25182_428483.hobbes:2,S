My thoughts are mixed on continuing to support text mode for anything
other than initial boot/install. Linux is all about multiple languages
and the character ROMs for text mode don't support all of these
languages. Moving towards only bitmapped consoles means that all the
Unicode languages can be made available with a standard API. This is
an area that deserves more discussion.
