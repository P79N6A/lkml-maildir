Looking at the code, it's obvious why this doesn't fix the problem - you
are still doing 380 usecs (with SHA_CODE_SIZE 3) to 780 usecs (with
SHA_CODE_SIZE 0) worth of work inside the spinlock, it is just being
deferred via a workqueue, rather than executing right away.  So this
improves the average case, but does not help the worst case scenario at
all.  380 usecs is too long to hold a spinlock.
