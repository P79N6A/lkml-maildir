Sorry Trond,                                                          
this is a weak try of an explanation. All involved fs types are       
reiserfs. The problem occurs reproducably only after (and including)  
2.2.20 and above and _not_ in 2.2.19. There must be some problem.     
Though I do not know whether the problem is on the client side, or    
simply produced by this client side and effectively located on 2.4.18 
server, I really can't tell. But giving me something to try might     
clear the picture.                                                    
Any hints?
