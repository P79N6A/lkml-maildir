pause for

We are completely OT here, but anyway it may be common interest:      
Applying this patch makes some of my problems go. dos-box does no     
longer hang the whole guest system, but succeeds in 4 of 5 runs. If it
does not output anything inside the dos-window and I hit the          
fullscreen (ALT-ENTER) everything is normal, ALT-ENTER again shows the
correct win desktop with dos-box and correct output there.            
It is almost ok, it does not hang, only a minor quirk left.           
Thanks,
