airo driver suspend is still broken. i still need to apply the patch
posted originally at (with an explanation of why airo suspend is not
working anymore)
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116025080215854&w=2 to
get the driver to suspend. (the patch still applies to 2.6.19-rc2 with
minor fuzz).
