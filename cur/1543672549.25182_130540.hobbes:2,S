Greetings Folks,
As some of you know, I've been muttering about the behavior of the new 
scheduler, and discovered that the priority boost tasks receive via 
sleeping on a contended lock is my main problem.  This can lead to a whole 
string of tasks which have been promoted above _other_ lock holders, 
effectively starving them for an indeterminate amount of time with some 
workloads.  (make -j30 bzImage in ext3 fs is wonderful example, but the 
problem appears to be generic, and is visible here in ext2 as well).  With 
ext3 on my up/preempt box, this leads to nearly zero concurrency for a make 
-j30 bzImage.
The method I decided to try to defeat this problem is to take advantage of 
those times when the scheduler would normally just return to the same task 
(which the programmer asked to be rescheduled), and at this time, slip in a 
lower priority task if possible to give a lower priority lock holder a 
chance to release it's lock.  For instance, once you have _one_ priority 17 
task left, and it finished it's timeslice, instead of returning to that 
task (or higher), select the stalest task from either the active array or 
the expired array instead.  It won't run for long, but _might_ have time to 
release the lock.  If you try the attached in ext3, you'll see that it's 
pretty effective.  It's still subject to a long queue at one priority, but 
I figured I'd post this for now, and see what kind of comments/flames I get 
back before doing any more experiments 8)
I also made sure that no task will keep the cpu without at least _trying_ 
to switch for a maximum of 50ms.  This is a variant of Ingo's timeslice 
split method, but doesn't introduce (isn't supposed to anyway;) any 
unneeded context switches for friendly tasks.
Comments/flames welcome.  (test reports as well)
