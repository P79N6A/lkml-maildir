The devices and adapters certainly are in the system;
that's hardware!  Do you maybe mean "before the driver
for an SPI adapter is bound to its device", and are
you maybe talking about driver model data structures?
The thing which exists before the SPI adapter driver is
bound to its device node is just a table.  It lists the
SPI devices, and holds information needed later to set
up the hardware.  Way simpler than ACPI or BIOS tables.

That "only restriction" is the one I was talking about!!
It contorts the normal roles and responsiblities of the
adapter drivers; and it's not necessary.

Lots of systems have their earliest boot code provide a
table of devices that exist (but which can't be probed).
That's how my patch approaches SPI.
As for that "every time" ... I don't know about you, but
the systems I've seen will register at most a handful of
devices and adapters; and adapters register just once.
For those numbers, even linear search is just fine.

... but the ".text" size is MUCH less; and what I sent
was not built as a ".so", so there's other oddness too.
I got something on the order of 0x04d0 bytes with the
refresh I just posted (call it 1200 bytes text).
