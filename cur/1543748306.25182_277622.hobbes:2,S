I've released the 047 version of udev.  It can be found at:
  	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-046.tar.gz
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
And there is a general udev web page at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html
Lots of changes here in this release, see the full changelog below.
Highlights are:
	- massive change with the way udevd can now work.  See
	  
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hotplug.devel/6173
 for
	  more details on this (Kay's changes are now part of udev
	  proper, you don't have to apply anything for this to work,
	  just follow the directions in
	  
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hotplug.devel/6192
	  to enable this mode.)
	- wait_for_sysfs is now gone.
	- bugfixes and rules file tweaks
	- add ability to handle expressions in GROUP rules.
Thanks to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a full list
of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of udev from the BitKeeper tree can be found at:

If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just email me.
thanks,
