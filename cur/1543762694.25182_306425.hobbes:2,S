Sorry that I didn't answer earlier , but I didn't have much time the
last week. Unfortunately my laptop has a serial port only via docking
station that I don't have. So I tried logging via netconsole. This
generally worked, but when I try to enter S3 the last thing I get is
"PM: Entering state" but the laptop never enters S3, it just hangs there
forever. So sadly I couldn't get more information.
If anyone has any idea what else I could do to either fix this problem
or get more information about it, please tell me and I'll try :)
