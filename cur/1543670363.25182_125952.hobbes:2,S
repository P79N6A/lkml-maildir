Probably not.  I did try something like that over a year ago, and it
didn't work as well as I'd expected.  One problem, I think, is that
while it's going through pages already in the swap cache, swapoff
may not need to allocate memory itself; but meanwhile other tasks
are trying to allocate memory and getting OOMkilled.  I think that
argues that swapoff does need to register itself for the duration
with the OOMkiller: a PF_ flag achieves that but a __GFP flag does not.
