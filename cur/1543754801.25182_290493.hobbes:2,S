Ingo, I have been looking at the code being proposed by John Stultz.  It looks 
like it handles all the issues I am talking about here.  I think it would be 
best to leave the RT patch as it is WRT this issue and work on getting John's 
patch ready for prime time as any work I would do here will just get tossed when 
his patch hits the steet.
Meanwhile, I will (already have) get HRT working on RT and make that available 
in the next few days.
