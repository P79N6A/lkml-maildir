The proposed patchset is based on the zoned counter patchset. This means 
that critical counters have been converted to use different macros. The 
following discussion of Marcelo and Nick on nr_mapped etc is not relevant 
to this patch since nr_mapped etc are not event counters but are handled 
by the zoned counters.
The event counters are the leftover vanity counters that are referenced 
only for display in /proc and the proposed approach is to only allow 
increments and allow racy updates.
Then these lightweight counters are also used to optimize away the numa 
specific counters in the per cpu structures.
