   I think that interface programmers should think
   whether their public interfaces might be needed from the modules
   and export symbols accordingly.
Yes, but only when actually used.
The ipv4 counterparts are exported because, lo' and behold, ipv6 makes
use of them.
Let's wait until your work is integrated into the kernel tree, or some
other similar project, which makes use of these symbols.  That is the
appropriate time at which to decide what we export for modules.
Later,
