The only issue I'm aware of are structures with long long. IA64 and
x86-64 are special in that long long has a different alignmnet in 32bit
and 64bit (4 bytes in 32bit, 8 bytes in 64bit). All the other archs with
compat code have always 8 byte alignment. This means if sparc64 doesn't
do a conversion, but x86-64 does you cannot put it into the COMPAT_IOCTL
list. Make sure you only use the common set.
Fortunately long long is not that common and many uses of it are already
8 byte aligned, but not all are.
