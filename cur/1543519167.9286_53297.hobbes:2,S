Cachable CPU stores (whether buffered due to a cache miss or not) will not
be carried out to system bus, they will only be put into the cache. The
architecture does not guarantee anything about the ordering in theory,
but in all current implementations the only effect is that loads may be
moved ahead of pending stores and stores may be combined (but not on
guarded memory which happens to be the case of areas returned by ioremap).
Are the previous buffered stores to cachable memory or not ? Tthis may
make a difference AFAIK.

Well, I consider the current state not completely satifactory and I have
an example in a driver in which I have to write a few PCI device registers
to control a DMA operation and then wite to one register to trigger the
operation:
- if I use only writel, one extra eieio instruction is needlessly added  
after each writel while I don't care in which order the registers are set.
- if I use __raw_writel I have to byte swap with cpu_to_le32 which
generates more code. I then have to add iobarrier_w() just before the last
writel but this is normal.
So in the end I defined my own macros to access the registers of this
device: sometimes I don't care about reordering/merging for 5 or so
consecutive register writes which are a mixture of big and little endian
accesses. Without considering code bloat, eieio is expensive on some
processors since it goes to the bus to tell the bridge not to perform
reordering.

It sems they have disappeared from Motorola's web sites. I can send you
the pdf (it's called programming environment manual or PEM for short) 
files if you are interested.
