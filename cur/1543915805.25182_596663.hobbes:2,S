Hello,
The tarball attached to this mail contains module source and scripts
to test new sysfs interface.
* sysfs-interpreter : kernel module to call sysfs interface functions
  as directed via debugfs file /sys/kernel/debug/sysfs-interpreter.
  It keeps internal list which maps path name to sysfs_dirent pointer.
  Note that userland is perfectly capable of causing oops using this
  module.  Other than usage of pathnaem instead of pointer, most
  functionalities are exported verbatim.
  All test nodes are created under /sys/test which is created on
  module load and removed on unload.
* si-runcmd.pl : perl script to execute sysfs commands using
  sysfs-interpreter.  It reads from stdin line-by-line and executes
  them.  For example "echo remove test-dir | si-rumcmd.pl" removes
  /sys/test/test-dir.
* si files : these files are to be fed to si-runcmd.pl and test
  certain features of sysfs.  For batch-error.si to work, you need to
  modify sysfs_new_dirent() such that it fails allocation if mode
  contains invalid bits.
Thanks.
