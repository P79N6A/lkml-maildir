I agree that they are probably not all replaceable, and care must be taken.
Examples:
1. In the types of sys_[gs]ethostname, sys_[gs]etdomainname, "int len" could be replaced
by "unsigned int" or "size_t" and sanity check simplified.
2. In mm/shmem.c, shmem_symlink(), we have "len = strlen(symname) + 1;". Although it is highly
improbable that strlen(symname) overflows, it is more correct to declare "size_t len;".
3. The similar situation occurs in fs/namei.c, vfs_readlink(). Here it does not matter if len
is declared to be unsigned, but for size_t, we have to take care about the size of size_t.
