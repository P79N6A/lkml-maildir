It's also the other way around:
Is e.g. NFSv4 support really still experimental?
There are only few parts of the kernel where the EXPERIMENTAL tags are 
actually maintained, but most of them were simply added once and stayed 
forever. If my "remove all EXPERIMENTAL tags" approach is not considered 
the best solution I have no problem with starting with "convert 
EXPERIMENTAL to FOO_EXPERIMENTAL in all areas where the subsystem 
maintainer wants to do so" and remove the remaining EXPERIMENTAL tags 
later.
