Was that before or after you changed HZ to 1000? I *think* that increased
the frequency of IO-APIC reprogramming by a factor of 10, though I might
be misreading the code. If it does depend on HZ, I think that's bad.
People in our benchmarking group (Andrew, cc'ed) have told me that 
reducing the frequency of IO-APIC reprogramming by a factor of 20 or so
improves performance greatly  - don't know what HZ that was at, but the
whole thing seems a little overenthusiastic to me.
