No, in many of the use cases, we're trying to do "if application reads certain
specified sequences of bits from disk we know about it", which is subtly
different.  Often, *absolute* prevention isn't required, as long as we can
generate audit trails and/or alerts...

For many usage cases (such as virus scanners), mmap() isn't really an issue,
because if another process is *already* trying to mmap() the file before it's
even finished downloading from the network interface, you have other problems.
In that case, what you *really* want to be hooking is read() from a network
socket, not a disk file - and I don't think you can mmap() a socket anyhow,
right?
Similarly, if you're using these exit points to do *indexing*, you really don't
care if it got mmap()'ed - at worst, it isn't indexed until the other CPU gets
around to it.
