Yes, having looked through that now, I agree with you 100%.

No need for Nicolas to respond, I think I've found what's "wrong":
see below.

I expect you're right, but that's a separate issue.  I had thought
you were approving Christoph's ARM patch because both you and he seemed
to agree that kmalloc was inappropriate for use in dma_alloc_coherent,
whatever additional issues you saw with it.
I still don't see why kmalloc is wrong there myself: for a while
I bought Christoph's alignment argument, but now I don't see why
(more than long) alignment is important to it.  But I'm easily
wrong when it comes to DMA mapping issues.

The fix for 2.6.22 is my PageSlab test in page_mapping which Linus
already put into -git.
And I now rather think that needs to stay, not be replaced by the
VM_BUG_ON Christoph was proposing for 2.6.23 (which earlier I acked).
Christoph responded to my page_mapping patch by looking at arch/arm,
and there finding a kmalloc in dma_alloc_coherent which he didn't
like; but you're right, it's entirely irrelevant to Nicolas' oops.
The slub allocation which gives rise to Nicolas' oops in not in
ARM, but (I'm guessing) in drivers/mmc/core/sd.c: one of those
	status = kmalloc(64, GFP_KERNEL);
where status is passed down for the response from mmc_sd_switch.
And what is wrong with using kmalloc there?
Why should that be changed to allocate a whole page?
How many other such cases might there be?
And the flush_dcache_page in at91mci_post_dma_read looks correct
to me too: it has just filled and perhaps also swabbed a buffer,
that buffer might in some cases be mapped into userspace, so it
calls flush_dcache_page.
In the kmalloc case it's not mapped into userspace: flush_dcache_page
should detect that and do nothing, as it does with slab; but slub was
reusing page->mapping for something else, so we oopsed.
