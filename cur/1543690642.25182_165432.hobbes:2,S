This is fine. Another solution would be that cdrom_get_track_info returns
the actual amount of data that was read, so that the caller may check
that the field it needs was really filled up.

This we don't know, and I don't think we may do much about it. The cdrom
drive is a Dell one, connected to a dell laptop. They don't come from
the same laptop package at first, but it should still work (or linux may
try to work it around).
The very funny thing about it is that with 2.4 there was no problem
merely because it happened that the not filled up track_size field
already had a very big value, so that linux would think the cd is
actually very big and let i/o go...
