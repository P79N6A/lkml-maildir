Subject: ppc knfsd boogums to be patched in 2.2.11?

Hi all,
I noticed that the PPC syscall table (arch/ppc/kernel/misc.S) has an
incorrect #ifdef at line 885 that stops knfsd from starting.  It
currently reads:
#ifdef CONFIG_NFS
        .long sys_nfsservctl
#else
        .long sys_ni_syscall
#endif
That should be CONFIG_NFSD, of course.  This appears to be fixed in
2.3.10 but pre-patch-2.2.11-1 doesn't have the fix.  Will this be put
into 2.2.11?
Regards,
 Robert.
