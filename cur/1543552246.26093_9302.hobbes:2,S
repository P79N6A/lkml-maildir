hi,
 I got a total freeze, while trying the command 'lpr example_textfile.txt' on
 a machine with no attached printer.
 Unfortunately there was no log according to this.
 I am using LPRng-3.6.26 with Linux-2.4.0-test9.
 If I can help to gather additional informations, please give me a
 hint, how to achieve this.
 Kind regards,
 Meino
