Yes, as often I can. But IMHO, it should be possible to unmount an
unreachable NFS fs even if it wasn't mounted with "intr". Otherwise we
have a quite silly "sysadmin trap".

One some machines, I killed more or less everything. It didn't help. One
some other machines, I couldn't kill so blindly. Remember, both "lsof" and
"fuser" hangs.
Also, as far as I understand, Solaris 8 does not require that you kill all
processes before unmounting, if you use the "-f" flag (processes will get
EIO). Would it be possible to implement this feature in Linux? That would
be really nice.
