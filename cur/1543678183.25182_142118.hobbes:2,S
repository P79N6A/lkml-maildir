Hi!
After having upgraded my notebook to 2.5.72, I noticed a rare problem,
that occurs about twice a day, maybe more.  After pressing a key, it
gets repeated endlessly until the next key is pressed.  When typing
fast, it is quite possible to cover up a couple of these, as the
repeats appear to happen at the set keyboard rates.  Problem never
occured with any 2.4 kernel.
I remember having read about this problem on the list before, but
didn't search my archive yet.  Also, I consider this to be a show
stopper, as the bug is already nasty when hitting 'q' inside mutt once
and might have worse effects with other programs.  YMMV.
