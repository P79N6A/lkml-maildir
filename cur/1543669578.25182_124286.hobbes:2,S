I can certainly accept such an argument for a single system. The
problem I have is with people then posting their errors on here
with the messages in a language that none of the maintainers on
here understands - how are we then expected to help them?
It is because of this requirement that I believe that message codes
in some form are unavoidable - at least with message codes, one
can look them up and find the version of the message translated
into one's own language. However, Linus has vetoed the idea of
putting such codes into the kernel in any form, and that makes the
whole idea a non-starter in any form.
Personally, I'm willing to discuss this issue and see what sort of
ideas we can come up with, and what problems each idea may have.

Agreed.

It would also have to handle all the cases of...
	#define CMD_PRINT(x...)   printk(KERN_INFO x)
			:
	CMD_PRINT("This is some useless information");
...that are spread amongst various subsystems. Personally, I'd prefer
to see macros like that replaced with the printk calls directly, but
that's up to the individual subsystem maintainers.
The simple way to do this would be to insert the kernel message tool
into the compilation process immediately after the macro expansion
tool has run, as all of the above macros would have been expanded at
that time. However, this requires that the intermediate files are
all saved as part of the compilation process, otherwise this tool
would have no means of accessing the expanded macros.

We need certain guarantees for this system to be usable. See my reply
to Alan Cox on this subject for details.
Best wishes from Riley.
