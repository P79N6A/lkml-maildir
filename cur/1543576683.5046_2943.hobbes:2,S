this remind me; perhaps you or Al could answer this.
  How hard would it be to have ramfs backed by swap? The goal being

I use ramfs for /tmp on my laptop -- it's very handy because it
extends the amount of the the disk had spent spun down and therefore
battery life; but writing large files into /tmp can blow away the
system or at the very least eat away at otherwise usable ram. Not
terribly desirable.
