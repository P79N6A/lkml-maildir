Announcing libhugetlbfs -- A library to provide easier access to
hugetlbfs.
Adam Litke and David Gibson began work on this library to enable
applications to benefit from using hugetlb pages in a transparent way
and without source-level modifications.  We'd like to see this become
the focal point for userspace development and are interested in
integrating other functionality beyond what's listed below. 
Currently supported uses:
 - Transparent hugetlb-backed malloc
 - Remapping ELF program segments into hugetlb pages
See the HOWTO included in the distribution for usage instructions.
