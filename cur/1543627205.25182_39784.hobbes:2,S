NO, please. There are hundreds of scenarios where that could be dangerous.
Suppose you load the RAID
module when all partitions are mounted, and two partiton in mirror are
mount on different mount point (you can do this, raid module is not
loaded, and so...). And now you load the module and md device is
registered. That would not be really nice, also if it is ulikely that you
could damnage your system
