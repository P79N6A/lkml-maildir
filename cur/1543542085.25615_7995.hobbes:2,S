Hi Wallace,
I looked at all of these drivers/usb/* warnings and they are all OK in
2.4.0-test7-pre7.  I'm not planning to check 2.3.99.
I believe that most of these are OK because the checker tool can't
(doesn't) recognize that a called function can (does) free the allocated
memory instead of it being freed in the same function.
The itemized USB list is below if you care to see it.
Thanks for your work on this and the other checkers.
~Randy
