I would strongly suggest you to fuck off and mind your own servers. Block
whoever you want to block and let everyone else do the same. But TAKE THIS
AWAY FROM l-k. Alone with your principles, communications and luserness.
As the saying goes, even if the WWIII will begin, there will be only a
couple of froups where such announcement will be on-topic. And there is
another one: net is not a democracy. It's a confederation of dictatorships.
If I want to block domains with md5 of admin contact's NIC handle ending
on 42 I'll fscking do it and anybody who's going to tell me about rights
and principles is perfectly free to bugger off.
