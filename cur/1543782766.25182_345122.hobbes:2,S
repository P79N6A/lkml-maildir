Subject: [PATCH] PNPACPI: clean blacklist
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
this patch clean the blacklist and should be applied after "only parse 
device that have CRS method" patch:
Battery, Button, Fan don't have a CRS and should be removed.
PCI root, PIC, Timer are in pnpbios and are harmless.
Please comment and consider for inclusion.
Thanks,
Matthieu
