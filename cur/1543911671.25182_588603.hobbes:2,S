Nope. The ntpdate call comes much later, and finally sets the system clock
correctly so that there are no lasting effects of all this.

After the "your system time is not correct" messages, and before the
regular "Try to get initial date and time via NTP" message accompanying
the ntpdate call.

It does. Booting 2.6.23-rc3 after that, the system comes up with none
of these messages.
