Probably, but I don't think either interface is perfect.
copy_*_user_page() will double flush the user mapping
(get_user_pages() already does a flush_dcache_page()).  Actually
nothing except ptrace uses the copy_*_user_page() interface even
though there are many uses of get_user_pages().
What I think get_user_pages() really needs is a single operation that
  - flushes the virtual address view
  - flushes the kernel view
regardles whether the page is anonymous or file backed.
