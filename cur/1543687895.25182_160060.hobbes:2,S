Read my rfc on the orthogonal interactivity patches and look under priority 
inversion. It may be that, in which case it happens to vanilla as well. To 
capture useful information for me is quite easy. Run a reniced -11 top -d 1 
-b in batch mode and reniced -11 vmstat 1 in batch mode to capture it 
happening. That should be enough information to see what's going on and 
doesn't need a kernel compile or any special tools. Renice -11 to make sure 
the tools dont get preempted in that period.
