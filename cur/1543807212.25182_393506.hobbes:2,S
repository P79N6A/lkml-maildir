Couldn't this still be implemented entirely in Kconfig, without
modifying page.h? Like in the following example:
	[...]
	config VMSPLIT_1G
		bool "1G/3G user/kernel split"
	config VMSPLIT_X
		bool "Manual split"
endchoice
config PAGE_OFFSET
	hex
	range 0x40000000 0xC0000000    
	prompt "Memory split address (must be aligned to 4096)" if VMSPLIT_X
	[...]
	default 0x40000000 if VMSPLIT_1G
	default 0xC0000000
Cheers
