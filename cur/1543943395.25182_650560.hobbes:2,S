A daemon based solution would work for the "normal" case, where we
have a single mount namespace and a single /etc/mtab file, and we hope
it doesn't get too much out of sync with what is actually in the
kernel (on remount the mount options do get out of sync, but hey, we
seem to be able to live with that).
However, once you start using multiple namespaces, the daemon based
solution quickly becomes unusable, because you would need a separate
daemon for each namespace, and it would have to somehow keep track of
mount propagations in userspace (which is basically impossible), etc,
etc...
Does that answer your question?
Thanks,
