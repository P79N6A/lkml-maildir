Uh, this is fine. We always call the NMI watchdog handler, so it will
see apic irqs get stuck, and work anyway.

wrong. If we are using counters 0 and 1, and 1 overflows, oprofile
resets that, then 0 overflows, the NMI watchdog will see it and
incorrectly reset it. You HAVE to avoid the reset - you can test it if
you don't believe me.

Yes.

And if it was handled previously, you reset it to not handled ? Uh ?
