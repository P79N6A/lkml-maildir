Yes, the minimum functionality is to pass on everything the first stage
kernel sees, plus a means to adjust it in the process, e.g. in order to
filter out options only intended for the first stage, or to fix
information originating from the BIOS.
Passing results from "expensive" discovery processes is optional, but
probably important in practical use.
