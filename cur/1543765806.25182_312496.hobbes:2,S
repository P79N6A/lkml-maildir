As I said, the testcase only works with our hardware, and it's also very large.  It's one 
small test that's part of a huge test suite.  It takes a couple hours just to install the 
damn thing.
We want to produce a simpler test case that demonstrates the problem in an 
easy-to-understand manner, but we don't have time to do that now.
