  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.3.10 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v130 and devfs-patch-v99.7 (or later).
NOTE: if you have generic devfs entries in /etc/modules.conf, you will
need to remove them.
The main changes are:
- Created generic /etc/modules.devfs file which is installed along
  with devfsd
- Added "-C /etc/modules.devfs" when calling modprobe(8)
- Updated man page
- Updated sample devfsd.conf file.
				Regards,
					Richard....
