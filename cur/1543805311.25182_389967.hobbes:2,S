Thanks Ingo,
I stressed in sending the patch that there was a big assumption that the
calls would not be done in (soft)irq context.  I just didn't want to add
overhead if it wasn't needed.  But I guess that this is needed until we
can remove all the instances that use it in softirq context. But that's
for a later patch.
