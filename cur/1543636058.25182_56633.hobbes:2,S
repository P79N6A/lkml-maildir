It's not obvious to me, either, I actually read the stuff and didn't
see where the problem could be.
It appeared to fail before console_init(). The system is largely
dedicated to other projects so there will be a bit of turnaround time
between test runs. I'll probably be able to pinpoint the point of
failure later tonight.
Cheers,
Bill
