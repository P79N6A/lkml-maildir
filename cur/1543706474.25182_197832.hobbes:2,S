Yes, more exactly it means that the last 64 times the idle task was called the
bus master was detected as being used.

Well, my laptop seems fine. When I unplug the mouse the bus master activity goes
to 0000000. I've very little idea about how the bus master has to be used and
even less about the uhci host controller. However, at a first glance I thought
it was weird to see full bus master activity when all that is connected is a
mouse not being used. Do you think it's normal?
