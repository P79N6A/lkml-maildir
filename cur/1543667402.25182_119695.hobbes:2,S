According to lspci output, the resources for your card are of type
"IO", not "memory". You use ioremap only for the later.
If you are not sure about the resource type, look at the resource
flags.
So instead of using ioremap along with {read,write}{b,w,l} accessors,
use the output of pci_resource_start() directly with {in,out}{b,w,l}
(and eventually {in,out}s{w,l} for non-byteswapped "stream" access).
Ben.
