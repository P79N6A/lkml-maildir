Yeah, that optimization actually breaks on so many filesystems
(AFS/Coda/iso9660/msdos/any filesystem which contains more than 65538
subdirectories in a directory/you name it) that they even provided a
flag to disable it (-noleaf), which in my opinion should always be the
default setting.
Another trick on the 'filesystem side' of things is to set the directory
linkcount to 1. Basically find always subtracts 2 and then as long as
the count is not zero, it will stat the entry to see if it's a
directory. So a directory linkcount of 1 will 'underflow' and find will
work correctly for the first 65535 sub-directories.
It's been on my todo list to use this fix in Coda as we have some link
count issues when we're flipping entries between 'faked' symlinks for
mountpoints/conflicts and real directories.

ps. shouldn't the linkcount of the old_dir get decremented too? Also you
should only change the linkcounts when the operation completed
successfully. i.e. something more like,
--- /tmp/shmem.c.orig	Thu Feb 14 01:17:23 2002
+++ /tmp/shmem.c	Thu Feb 14 01:18:25 2002
