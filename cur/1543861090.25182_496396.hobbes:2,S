Gene,
There is no such driver in the kernel at this time.  There is an
out-of-kernel driver available here:
	
http://rtl8180-sa2400.sourceforge.net/
YMMV.
FWIW, I know of at least one person working on a driver for the
d80211-based stack in wireless-dev.  I'm not sure when that will be
available publicly.
Hth!
John
