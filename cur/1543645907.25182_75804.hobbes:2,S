Just that no 'security' module implements a special handler for it. E.g. in
selinux it ends up in
		/* default case assumes that the command will go
   		 * to the file's ioctl() function.
      		 */
      		default:
      			error = file_has_perm(current, file, FILE__IOCTL);

Right.  an hook for ->ioctl() is completly useless.  Remember that ioctl
is nothing but a magic backdoor to add syscalls.  You need to do the
permission check in code that actually knows what it is doing, not in
the dispatcher.

You should add a check where the name isactually assigned in this case.
Not that I think a check on the device name is generally a good idea..

You've missed the point.  I never wanted to use it.  I care about the crap
that it adds to the kernel which I do want to use, develop and keep
clean.

Without ever seeing that module?

The person who performs the audit can know it.  But how often will that be
the author of the LSM module?

It's not bad to solve a problem.  It's a bad idea trying to 'solve' a problem
you don';t understand fully.

Adding random hack without resolving the underlying problem is not the
way linux kernel development usually works.
