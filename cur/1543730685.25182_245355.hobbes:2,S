I think it's supposed to do so now, and actually fails to only sometimes in
practice and I don't know what the conditions are.  But, if you find it
acceptable that a traced task stay stopped in trace and not die from
SIGKILL until the tracer resumes it or detaches/dies, then aiming for that
certainly makes it easier to keep the ptrace code race-free.

I'm going to try it out very soon and then we can see how the testing goes.
