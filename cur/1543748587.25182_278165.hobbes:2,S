Demur.  do_swap_page has to mark_page_accessed because the page from
the swap cache is already on the LRU, and for who knows how long.
The others (and count in fs/exec.c's install_arg_page) are dealing
with a freshly allocated page they are putting onto the active LRU.
My inclination would be simply to remove the mark_page_accessed
from do_anonymous_page; but I have no numbers to back that hunch.
