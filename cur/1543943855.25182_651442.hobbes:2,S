I normally hate to throw in a 'me-too', but I'm also seeing a
suspend-to-ram regression on my Thinkpad R61i that I've managed to
bisect down to the same patch series.
You beat me emailing the issue to the list by a few minutes :)

My symptoms in this case are slightly different - the suspend appears to
work correctly, and is fast. However, when I resume, the screen lights
up quickly, but the system hangs for nearly a minute with the suspend
light still on solid before it actually resumes. No delay is visible in
dmesg; this apparently happens before the "return to C".

I just tried reverting the above-mentioned 3 commits, doing so fixes the
delay.

Rather similar system - I have a core 2 duo 1.5 running x86_64 gentoo,
and a GM965 chip (using uvesafb)
