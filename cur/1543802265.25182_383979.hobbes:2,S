if the data needed to be accessed by the CPU anyway it's free becouse 
otherwise the CPU would stall waiting for the next chunk of memory. you 
can do quite a bit of work on data in cache while you are waiting for the 
next cache line to load.
in this same way, checksumming a network packet is free if the CPU needs 
to copy the data anway, it only costs something if the data could bypass 
the CPU.
