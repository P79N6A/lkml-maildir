Ah, excellent. Thanks for getting those numbers Dave. This will
be a great help towards getting the patch merged.
I'm just working on the final required piece for this thing (the
pte_special pte bit, required to distinguish whether or not we
can refcount a page without looking at the vma). It is strictly
just a correctness/security measure, which is why you were able
to run tests without it. And it won't add any significant cost to
the fastpaths, so the numbers remain valid.
FWIW, I cc'ed linux-arch: the lockless get_user_pages patch has
architecture specific elements, so it will need some attention
there. If other architectures are interested (eg. powerpc or
ia64), then I will be happy to work with maintainers to help
try to devise a way of fitting it into their tlb flushing scheme.
Ping me if you'd like to take up the offer.
Thanks,
Nick
