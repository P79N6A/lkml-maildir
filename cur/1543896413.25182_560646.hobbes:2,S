The more I'm thinking about this, I think it's simplest to just add
fields to the right of the existing /proc/*/mounts.  Yes, the format is
ugly, and it will end up being uglier still, but it's also ugly to have
a bunch of different chunks of information formatted in different ways.
So, the existing fields are:
mnt_devname mnt_path filesystem_type options 0 0
... and we'd want to add ...
mnt_id propagation_info sb_dev path_to_fs_root
As previously stated, in order to avoid having to expose kernel
addresses to userspace, I suggest we simply add a counter field to
struct vfsmount and use that for mnt_id.
I'm not all that up on what is needed for propagation_info.  I presume
we want to be able to deduce the full mount lattice.  One particularly
important thing in my mind is to be able to distinguish overmounted
filesystems (which I think is possible in the current setup only by
ordering -- the filesystem on top I believe will end up last in
/proc/mounts, but I don't know if there actually is anything that
enforces that.)
