Please provide a complete dmesg log up to and including the failure
point where the kernel complains about stuck NMIs.
I tried 2.6.12-rc2-mm3 SMP on UP amd64 and I immediately found a
bug triggering bogus stuck NMI failures, and I want to check if
what you're seeing is caused by the same bug.

Orthogonal issue. Let's ignore this one for now.

This may or may not work as you intend. There is _no_ documented reason
to assume that RETIRED_UOPS would provide a more steady stream of events
than CYCLES_PROCESSOR_IS_RUNNING. Both events are likely to be idle in
HLT states, for instance.
The local APIC + performance counter driven NMI watchdog simply cannot
provide wall-clock like behaviour. You need the I/O-APIC driven watchdog
for that, or to prevent the kernel from using HLT when idle.

This is as bogus as "#define ONE 2". CYCLES_PROCESSOR_IS_RUNNING
_is_ event 0x76 (AMD renamed it recently, but that's irrelevant).
Using RETIRED_UOPS requires a new define, and a modification to
the K7_NMI_EVENT #define.
