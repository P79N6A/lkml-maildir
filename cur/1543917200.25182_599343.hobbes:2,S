It's even worse than I thought on the first check:
"noapictimer" on the command line of an SMP box prevents _ONLY_ the boot
CPU apic timer from being used. But the secondary CPU is still
unconditionally setting up the APIC timer and uses the non calibrated
variable calibration_result, which is of course 0, to setup the APIC
timer. Wreckage guaranteed.
