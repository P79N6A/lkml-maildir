Ah, interesting. I think s390 could do the same with the upcoming 5.1 release
of z/VM. However, we decided to ask for an implementation of a futex hypercall
instead, which lets us implement the linux spinlock as a hypervisor semaphore.

I'm not sure if this has been measured, maybe Martin or Eberhard knows more.
