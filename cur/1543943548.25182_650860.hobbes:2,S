Subject: preempt rcu bug on s390

Using CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU and CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ on s390 my system always
gets stuck when running with more than one cpu.
When booting with four cpus I get all four cpus caught withing cpu_idle
and not advancing anymore. However there is the init process which is
waitung for synchronize_rcu() to complete (lcrash output):
STACK TRACE FOR TASK: 0xf84d968 (swapper)

If I change the code so that timer ticks won't be disabled everything
runs fine. So my guess is that rcu_needs_cpu() doesn't do the right
thing for the rcu preemptible case.
Kernel version is git head of today.
Any ideas?
