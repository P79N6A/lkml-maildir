I just double checked and the usual:
make O=output samples/
It works as expected and build all the samples.
It is documented by make help like this:
$ make help
  ...
  dir/            - Build all files in dir and below
The above is generic functionality and I do not see any
need for a special target to build the samples.

The samples were added so we avoided them to bit-rot.
We do not want to build samples unconditionally - that should be pretty
obvious.
So maybe I did not get what you actually was asking?

There is _nothing_ preventing us from adding stuff tomorrow that has
be build as built-in. Some sample code documenting early cpu init
stuff for instance. And we do not want this code to clash with
other kernel code if global symbols are duplicated.
This thinking that samples are solely modules are wrong. It is correct that
most of it is expected to be modules but not all of it.
I only found one little glitch.
$ make modules
does not build the samples.
