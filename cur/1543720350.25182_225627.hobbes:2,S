Makes sense, applied.
However, wouldn't it make sense to have this on the ppc64 branch too?
Admittedly on ppc64, the flush_tlb_page_nohash() function would be a
no-op, since it always has the hash tables, but I'm a blue-eyed optimists,
and I'm still hoping that some day IBM will see the error of their ways, 
and get rid of the hash tables entirely. At which point ppc64 too will 
need to flush the TLB entry.
