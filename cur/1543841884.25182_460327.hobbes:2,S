The actual loop is slightly different (there are 4 elements in cmd->resp):
for (i=0; i < 4; i++) {
      resp[i] = readl(addr + RESP + (7 - 2 * i) * 4) << 16;
      resp[i] |= readl(addr + RESP + (6 - 2 * i) * 4);
}
As there are only 4 iterations it's not a lot of work to spare the compiler from address
calculation. readl also seems more appropriate than readw, as resp is array of u32.

I changed the variable and function names to *_timeout, but left the macros as *_TO. This way,
the macro name corresponds to the datasheet and the meaning is evident from context:
writel(data_timeout, sock->addr + SOCK_MMCSD_DATA_TO);
Additionally, I added defines for response and command types.
