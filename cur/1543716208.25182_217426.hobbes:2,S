Actually, I decided to investigate how 2.4 compares (we're still stuck
on 2.4)
According to this:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.1/0011.html
 
2.6 with swapiness of 0% is same as 2.4.19 - I assume 2.4.19's VM is
the same as 2.4.26 (given feature freeze).
I have always been completely unimpressed with the 2.4 VM - before and
after the big change in ~2.4.10. It has *always* preferred to use
cache in preference to a recently used application.
So will this still apply to 2.6 with swapiness of 0%?
I might try to get my sysadmin to put on 2.6, becuase 2.4 is quite
unusable for some of the work I do (if I need mozilla at the same time
as my visualisation software, which allocates a good 3/4 of RAM, after
reading a file that is about that size, leaving still enough for
mozilla and X combined, mozilla and parts of X still get swapped out -
and the cahce is wasted, since I only ever read the file once, and it
is written on another host)
