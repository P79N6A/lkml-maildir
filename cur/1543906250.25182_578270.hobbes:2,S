I agree it's a nice ego boost to see your code merged.
But... do you care more about your ego boost or about your problem
getting solved? I really want to change this if you say "ego for code
merging"... "ego boost for getting linux improved and being involved in
solving an important problem" is a lot better type of ego boost..
No developer can or should expect that most, or even half of his code to
be merged. Even Linus doesn't get half the code he writes into linux :)
Con did get a whole bunch of stuff merged over the years, and for the
rest he mostly got the problem solved. That's pretty successful....
