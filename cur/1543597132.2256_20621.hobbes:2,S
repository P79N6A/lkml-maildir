Hi,
this  one-liner fixes a longstanding bug in serial
for Timedia/Sunix/Exsys PCI cards !
The fix was sent to Ted several times since 02/2001 and
uploaded to 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/serial/.
There was no reaction.
By listing a defunct MAINTAINER the progress of linux is stuck
as patches go to /dev/null by
- the maintainer (who got lost for unknown, perhaps even valid reasons)
- Linus, as he waits for approval by the maintainer.
Linus, can you please include this patch?
Regards, Gunther
(Without this patch serial recognizes wrong number of serial ports!)
