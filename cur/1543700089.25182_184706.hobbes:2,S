Most journaling filesystems make guarantees on the filesystem meta-data, but
not on the data.  Some like ext3, and reiserfs (with suse's journaling
patch) can journal the data, or order things so that the data is written
before any pointers (ie meta-data) make it to the disk so it will be harder
to loose data.
