Of course.  Naturally it's near impossible to prevent people from
tweaking the software.  But reasonable restrictions are what regulatory
bodies expect.

Yes it can.   You're confusing the software with different or modified
software.  Different things.  And by the way, if you modify the software
to defeat the restrictions you are committing a criminal act, or you
would be if you did it in Australia.  You'd probably get with
crucifixion for a first offense!

What's your point?  That it's easy to break the law?  Nobody's arguing
against that.

Definitely no.  The manufacturer must ensure it meets local
regulations.  One way they do that is via the driver.

You're correct, but that's still how it is.  In fact, some manufacturers
provide country specific drivers simply to shore up this weakness. 
(They'd only do that to protect their regulatory approval.)

Are you asking if the manufacturer could lose their licence to sell the
product?  It could happen.  Regulators do wield significant powers.

That's the most likely result.  That would be what I expect would
happen.  This is why manufacturers view open source licences dimly in
certain markets, of which radio communications is just one example.
