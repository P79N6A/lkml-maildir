Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] The comedy of errors patchset (was: SELinux NetLabel updates)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This rev of the patchset solves both the original problem that Michal posted
involving backwards compatibility with old SELinux policy as well as the
problem Linus posted about the fix not working correctly when CONFIG_NETLABEL
was not set.  I also tried to fixup the #ifdefs in include/net/netlabel.h as
suggested.
I've tested both of these patches, in order, and neither have caused problems
(i.e. there shouldn't be any git bisect breakage issues if only the first
patch is applied).  I've also compiled both patches with and without
CONFIG_NETLABEL and have not seen any problems.
Once again, thank you all for your patience.
