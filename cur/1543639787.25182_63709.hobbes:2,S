The best place that I know of for information about ANY Dell server and
Linux is at 
http://www.domsch.com/linux/.
  There are instructions there on
how to get recent versions of the aacraid driver to recognize this card
during boot, assuming a fairly recent distribution.
The onboard network adapter is Broadcom NeXtreme Gigabit adapter.  I believe
this is supported in recent distributions/kernels by the tg3 driver and Dell
provides binary drivers from Broadcom as well.
Later,
Tom
