I do not know. I'll try to test it under 2.4.21 (ie, 2.4.21 + ACPI as USB 
won't work without ACPI on ATI-IGP+ALi combo, like my laptop. And that's a 
primary reason behind using 2.4.22-pre as ACPI is in the official 2.4 tree).

Unfortunately that isn't an option, as this is my production environment 
(incidentally I've used 2.5 in the past, but as you know 2.4 is the stable 
tree and is the most appropriate one).
I'm now searching the usb-devel archives to understand this issue, but do you 
think the upcoming 2.4.22-pre3 might fix this issue?
Thanks for your response :).
