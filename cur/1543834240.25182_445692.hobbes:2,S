Hi,
On my brandnew system, MSI K8MM3-V with a Celeron 3000+ and OpenSUSE 10.1 (with 2.6.16.13 kernel),
there are a lot of worrying powernow-k8 messages. How would I go about debugging this problem?
Any help is appreciated.
Below there are some lines of interest from /var/log/{boot.msg,messages}. This is a pretty
naked system. It has no keyboard or screen attached. The mobo has on-board VGA. There are
two SATA disks attached, and there is 512Mb memory. That's about it. If someone knowledgeable
would need more info, please let me know. The "failing targ, change pending bit set" messages
seem to be triggered on a moment that the SUSE system tries to switch cpufreq, for example
when Beagle kicks in.
Besides these powernow-k8 messages I am not able to see anything in /proc/acpi/thermal_zone
Some lines extracted from /var/log/boot.msg:
