I tried compiling as modules to see if that would make a difference.
Upon loading ide-probe-mod.o, it finds the 2 hdds that's on the promise card
and hangs (doesn't do this when compiled into the kernel).  At this point,
sysrq works just fine so I assume it just killed userland (I can't even
telnet into the box).
The HDDs are quantum hdds, that wouldn't be causing the problem, would it?
