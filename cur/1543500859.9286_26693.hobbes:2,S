Subject: Loopback driver bugfix for MTU setting : Patch included

Hi all
A small bug in the loopback driver (loopback.c). I have included a patch to fix
it.
Description:
The MTU for the loopback driver can be set to any positive value. This allows
people (root, that is why it isn't really too important) to change the MTU of
the loopback (lo) driver to values too small to be usable. I have found that
the stack will crash or the machine will reboot if it is set too low (less than
28). This patch provides protection for people stupid enough (me) to listen to
people on IRC about the stability of windows.
How it is triggered:
executing these commands as root will reboot or crash your computer:
ifconfig lo mtu 1
ping localhost
How I fixed It:
I modified loopback.c so that there is a new function (loopback_change_mtu) to
handle changing the MTU to be consistant with ethernet devices. I then modified
loopback_init to set dev->change_mtu to this function. Hopefully this is the
proper way to fix this bug
