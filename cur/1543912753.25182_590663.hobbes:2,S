This is more of a user question; please direct me to a kernel user list 
if that's more appropriate.
I am trying to find out if NCQ and port multiplier are suppored in the 
nVidia nForce 590 chipset?
Specifically, for the Asus Crosshair mobo.

Linux stuff has made big progress over the competition. When things sit and don't start right away, we have a watch, and those poor guys have to settle for an hourglass.
