(Sure?  :-)
Now this did not work at all. The '-n 3' was probably
correct, but when I tried to access the disk, then it
did not spin up again (I waited for 5 minutes). There
was no message on the console, either.
But I could not reproduce this problem.
How do I monitor that the disk spins down and up?
