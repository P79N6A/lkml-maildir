There is no table walking for discontigmem on ia64. Ia64 only creates page 
table if it needs to satify the Linux kernels demands for such a thing. 
And this is a kernel mapping. No page table involved.
The current sparsemem approach also does not need table walking. It needs
to do lookups in a table.
UP and SMP currently work cleanly.

That would work and also be in line with the existing overhead of the 
slabs.
