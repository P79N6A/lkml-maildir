Kernel: 2.4.20-pre8
Machine: dual 1.66Ghz AMD machine, Tyan motherboard 64/66 PCI,
   2 Intel PRO/1000 MT nics,
   1 DFE-570tx 4-port tulip based NIC.
   2 built-in 3-com NICs.
I was running 20Mbps over each of the 4 tulip 100Mbps ports, and nothing over
the gigE ports...  Things ran fine, but I occasionally saw messages like
this:
[root@localhost lanforge]# eth7: (19541091) System Error occured (2)
eth7: (19547299) System Error occured (2)
eth6: (19163408) System Error occured (2)
[root@localhost lanforge]# eth6: (19167052) System Error occured (2)
[root@localhost lanforge]# eth6: (19171414) System Error occured (2)
eth7: (19560749) System Error occured (2)
eth6: (19187463) System Error occured (2)
I mounted another machine across NFS using one of the 3-com ports, and
started this command: tar -xvzf /mnt/blah/kernel.foo.tgz
At this point, the machine starts behaving extremely slowly, but after
a few fits and bursts, it finishes and I can get a response at the prompt
again.
I see more messages similar to those above, and I also see these errors:
[root@localhost lanforge]# eth6: (19773823) System Error occured (2)
APIC error on CPU0: 00(02)
APIC error on CPU1: 00(02)
If anyone has any ideas, or can suggest more debugging information I can
gather to make the problem easier to solve, please let me know!
Thanks,
Ben
