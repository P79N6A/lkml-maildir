Yeah, sorry about that.  It was late and the whole TLS thing was a sudden
afterthought while I was in the middle of doing something else, so I didn't
feel like slicing up the patch any more.  And in my tree, GIT didn't even
do so great a job with noticing this rename.  I'll send a replacement.
Thanks,
Roland
