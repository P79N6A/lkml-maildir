No, they just seem to be affected worse by it than some other brands.
The bug is that libata/SCSI now spin-down the drive before the distro's
scripts are done with it, so it spins down, and then gets spun up again
by the distro, and then spun down again by the distro.
And along the way, one/both of the two causes a full mechanism "park",
which is hard on things if abused (like this).
Or at least that's what I recall for it.  Tejun?
