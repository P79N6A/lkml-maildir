Hi,
I think, it's problem in XAWTV, because I've got the same error if I
had only one TV tuner in my PC. I've solved the problem that I reduced
number of items in channel list. If I have in the list only 10
channels, then any of the four XAWTV didn't crashed. It's very
strange. It looks like the pop-up menu with the channel list write to
the memory of the graphics card somewhere out of the memory. What do
you think about it?
