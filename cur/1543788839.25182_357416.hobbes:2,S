Hi Chuck
Thats interesting, because on my machines I get opposite results :
On a Xeon 2.0 GHz, Hyper Threading, I get better results (in the sense of 
fairness) with the MOV version
    parent CPU 1, child CPU 0, using mov instruction for unlock
    parent did: 5291346 of 10000001 iterations
    CPU clocks:     3.437.053.244
    parent CPU 1, child CPU 0, using xchg instruction for unlock
    parent did: 7732349 of 10000001 iterations
    CPU clocks:     3.408.285.308
On a dual Opteron 248 (2.2GHz) machine, I get bad fairness results regardless 
of MOV/XCHG (but less cycles per iteration). A lot of variations in the 
results (maybe because of NUMA effects ?), but xchg gives slightly better 
fairness.
    parent CPU 1, child CPU 0, using mov instruction for unlock
    parent did: 256810 of 10000001 iterations
    CPU clocks:      772.838.640
    parent CPU 1, child CPU 0, using xchg instruction for unlock
    parent did: 438280 of 10000001 iterations
    CPU clocks:     1.115.653.346
    parent CPU 1, child CPU 0, using xchg instruction for unlock
    parent did: 574501 of 10000001 iterations
    CPU clocks:     1.200.129.428
On a dual core Opteron 275 (2.2GHz), xchg is faster but unfair.
(threads running on the same physical CPU)
    parent CPU 1, child CPU 0, using mov instruction for unlock
    parent did: 4822270 of 10000001 iterations
    CPU clocks:      738.438.383
    parent CPU 1, child CPU 0, using xchg instruction for unlock
    parent did: 9702075 of 10000001 iterations
    CPU clocks:      561.457.724
Totally different results if affinity changed so that threads run on different 
physical cpus  : (XCHG is slower)
    parent CPU 0, child CPU 2, using mov instruction for unlock
    parent did: 1081522 of 10000001 iterations
    CPU clocks:      508.611.273
    parent CPU 0, child CPU 2, using xchg instruction for unlock
    parent did: 4310427 of 10000000 iterations
    CPU clocks:     1.074.170.246
For reference, if only one thread is running, the MOV version is also faster 
on both platforms :
[Xeon 2GHz]
    one thread, using mov instruction for unlock
    10000000 iterations
    CPU clocks:     1.278.879.528
[Xeon 2GHz]
    one thread, using xchg instruction for unlock
    10000000 iterations
    CPU clocks:     2.486.912.752
Of course Opterons are faster :) (less cycles per iteration)
[Opteron 248]
    one thread, using mov instruction for unlock
    10000000 iterations
    CPU clocks:      212.514.637
[Opteron 248]
    one thread, using xchg instruction for unlock
    10000000 iterations
    CPU clocks:      383.306.420
[Opteron 275]
    one thread, using mov instruction for unlock
    10000000 iterations
    CPU clocks:      208.472.009
[Opteron 275]
    one thread, using xchg instruction for unlock
    10000000 iterations
    CPU clocks:      417.502.675
In conclusion, I would say that for uncontended locks, MOV is faster. For 
contended locks, XCHG might be faster on some platforms (dual core Opterons, 
only if on the same physical CPU)
