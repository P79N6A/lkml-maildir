This is just as broken as the previous patch that was posted.
_READ_ the gcc sources. See what those flags do.
The only differences are the enabling of PTA_SSE on the later models.
"Cool, I have SSE, I want optimised SSE routines". Bad luck.
This flag makes damn all difference on integer code. FP code is not
allowed in kernel space, and in the few exceptions where we do use it
(see the memcpy routines), it's guarded by explicit kernel_fpu_begin()
kernel_fpu_end() pairs, something that gcc wouldn't be able to add for us.
