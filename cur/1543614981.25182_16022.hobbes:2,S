	When X11 locks up, I can still kill it and my box lives.  When
framebuffers crash, their is no recovery save rebooting.  Back in 1995
I thought that linux VTs and X11 implemenation blew Solaris out of the
water, and now we want throw away our progress?  I'm still astounded
by the whole "oooh I can see  a penquin while I boot-up" thing?
Granted, frame buffers have usage in embedded systems, but do they
really have to be so deeply integrated??
