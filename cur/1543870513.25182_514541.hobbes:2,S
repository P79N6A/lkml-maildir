In i386 (with the exception of voyager) and x86_64,
hard_smp_processor_id is not used anywhere in the kernel when there are
no APICs available.
Regarding the overhead, hard_smp_processor_id is used mostly during
initialization and doesn't seem to be used in any fast path in i386,
x86_64, and ia64. All the other architectures are not affected by this
patch, because I kept the hardcoding of hard_smp_processor_id on UP
kernels, and just moved the definition to asm/smp.h because it should be
handled by architecture-speficic code.
So unless strictly necessary I would not like to make this patches
dependent on kdump.
