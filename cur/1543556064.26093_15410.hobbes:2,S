It looks like
	AT&T versions up to SysIII (at least), all UCB versions, Ultrix,
4.4BSD-derived systems, Solaris, pre-2.2.6 Linux, current 2.4.* Linux:
if access() says EROFS - open() will also fail with EROFS.
HP-UX and 2.2.6-2.2.18-pre*: give false alarm on access() even though they
allow open().
I would say that the latter group is badly outnumbered _and_ broken. It's one
thing when standard sets the bogus historical behaviour in stone, but
here we introduced bogus behaviour due to misreading the vague language
used in standard. Historically, on systems that allow write access to devices
on r/o filesystems access() doesn't return EROFS for devices. Moreover, that's
what one might reasonably expect and there are programs relying on that.
Principle of minimal surprise and all such...
