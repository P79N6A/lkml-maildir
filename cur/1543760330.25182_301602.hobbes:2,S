Right, if we didn't get scheduled often enough for us to send our
heartbeat messages to the other peers, they'll evict us from the cluster
and fence us, causing a service disruption.
With all these protections in place though, we can run at roughly 50ms
heartbeat intervals from user-space, reliably, which allows us a node
dead timer of ~200ms. I think that's pretty damn good.
(Of course, realistically, even for subsecond fail-over, 200ms keep
alives are sufficient, and 50ms would be quite extreme. But, it works.)

I've brought this up on the linux-ha-dev list. When do you need this?
