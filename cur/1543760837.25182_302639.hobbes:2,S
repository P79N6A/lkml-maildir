ok - the patch below is a small modification of Hugh's so that we clear
->break_lock unconditionally. Since this code is not inlined it ought to
have minimal icache impact too.

lock->break_lock is set when a lock is contended, but cleared only in
cond_resched_lock.  Users of need_lockbreak (journal_commit_transaction,
copy_pte_range, unmap_vmas) don't necessarily use cond_resched_lock on it.
So, if the lock has been contended at some time in the past, break_lock
remains set thereafter, and the fastpath keeps dropping lock unnecessarily.
Hanging the system if you make a change like I did, forever restarting a
loop before making any progress.  And even users of cond_resched_lock may
well suffer an initial unnecessary lockbreak.
There seems to be no point at which break_lock can be cleared when
unlocking, any point being either too early or too late; but that's okay,
it's only of interest while the lock is held.  So clear it whenever the
lock is acquired - and any waiting contenders will quickly set it again.
Additional locking overhead? well, this is only when CONFIG_PREEMPT is on.
Since cond_resched_lock's spin_lock clears break_lock, no need to clear it
itself; and use need_lockbreak there too, preferring optimizer to #ifdefs.
