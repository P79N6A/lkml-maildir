yeah. We've got init_task's task-struct embedded in the vmlinux, but 
it's aligned to 32 bytes, which probably hides this effect. We'd only 
see it if the size change just happened to bring a key data structure 
(which is also embedded in the vmlinux) just below a modulo 32 bytes 
boundary. The chance for that is around 6:32 per 'merge' event. That 
means that there cannot be all that many such cases ;-)
anyway, the shorter init sequence is worth it already.
