I'm having problems with the new i2c modules in the kernel
In order to make my miro pctv tv tuner card work, I used to run:
insmod videodev
insmod i2c
insmod tuner type=3
insmod bttv card=1
and it worked fine
With the latest 2.2.13 pre, I now insmod i2c-old instead of i2c, and get
the following error message:
This is xawtv-2.46, running on Linux/i686 (2.2.13-17mdk)
wmhooks: kde
x11: 1070x802, 16 bit/pixel, 2144 byte/scanline, DGA, VidMode
waitpid: No child processes
v4l: 1070x802, 16 bit/pixel, 2144 byte/scanline
WARNING: v4l and dga disagree about the framebuffer base
WARNING: you probably want to insmod the bttv module with "vidmem=0xe60"
WARNING: you might have to compile bttv with -DNODGA to make this work
WARNING: overlay mode disabled
With overlay disabled, the capture uses grabdisplay which eats 25% of my
cpu ressources in windowed mode (and I have a celeron 450). Overlay
takes less than 0.5% in fullscreen mode.
I managed to have overlay mode working with insmod bttv card=1
vidmem=0xe60, but some errors messages I get make me think that it's not
"clean"
Here's the output of dmsg for instance:
Linux video capture interface: v1.00
i2c: initialized
bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 18) bus: 0, devfn: 104, irq: 9, memory:

bttv: Video memory override: 0xe6000000
(the last 2 lines are repeated a dozen times)
When I start xawtv I get this in /var/log/messages
Oct 14 17:53:49 s103 kernel: bttv: PCI display adapter: <3>bttv: Unknown
video memory base address.
Oct 14 17:53:49 s103 kernel: bttv: Video memory override: 0xe6000000
(repeated 3 times)
Overall, using my tuner card is now less simple & clean, so I thought it
was worth being reported
