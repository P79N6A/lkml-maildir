They are both relying on the way user allocates memory for RDMA. The idea behind 
Michael's propose it to let library (MPI for instance) to tell to the
kernel that the pages are used for RDMA and it is not safe to copy them now. 
The pages may be anywhere in the process address space bss, text, stack
whatever.
