When I use your test application on the disabled drives, I get the following
results:
issuing FLUSH_CACHE: worked
issuing FLUSH_CACHE_EXT: failed 0x51/0x4!
Is FLUSH_CACHE_EXT also a requirement?  Would it not be possible to just add
this test function to ide-probe.c instead of looking for what the drive may
or may not be advertising properly?
