Ok, perhaps you shouldn't thank me ;) I actually sortof kinda broke your 
box... The reason why it worked before was because the kernel defaulted to 
disabling the IOAPIC on all nforce3 based systems but we found out that 
most nforce3 systems are actually work with the IOAPIC if we just ignore 
some bogus ACPI BIOS information. Your system happens to be one of the 
more broken ones, i'd actually like to try debug your problem a bit 
further, could you open up a bugzilla entry at bugzilla.kernel.org and 
email me when you're done. In the meantime, just keep booting with 
'noapic'
Thanks!
