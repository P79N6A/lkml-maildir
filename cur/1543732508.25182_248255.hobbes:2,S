Hello, Jim,
How do you mark a given CPU as being in realtime mode?  Or is the
timer-shutdown decision based on the presence of a realtime process
runnable on the given CPU or some such?
Still trying to figure out a way to make this work without adding
overhead to rcu_read_unlock()...
						Thanx, Paul
