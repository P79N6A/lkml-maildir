After a long silence on the strace development front development is
continueing again. Rick Sladkey passed the maintership over to me. I've
merged his version with the Debian strace package and am proud to
present the first pre-release for strace 4.0, version 3.99.
Here is a summary of the changelog:
 * Use autoconf 2.13
 * compiles with more Linux kernels
 * added support for more Linux architectures
 * add support for a lot of extra syscalls
 * fix some problems with hanging children
 * check stray syscall after execv
 * decode capget and capset arguments
 * add more constants to net.c
 * detect ROSE networking
 * add more protocol families to domains
 * add IPIP protocol
 * added MSG_PROXY and MSG_CTRUNC to msg_flags
 * added SO_BSDCOMPAT and SO_REUSEPORT to sockoptions
 * added IP, IPX and TCP-options
 * added IP, IPX and TCP support to get-/setsockopt()
 * added IPX support
 * updated handling of signals
 * handle struct stat correctly for Linux
This list probably misses a few items, there were a lot of changes. A lot
of these changes were made by others; I'ld especially like to thank
Nate Eldredge and Ulrich Drepper for their patches.
There are still some issues that should be resolved before strace 4.0
is released:
 * Linux sparc doesn't work. It seems the syscall numbers I got from the RedHat
   patch are bogus? 
 * Linux powerpc gets the stat structure wrong 
 * Linux alpha seems to crash occasionally? 
 * It needs to be tested on sgi, sunos and solaris.
If you want to help with these issues or have other patches or
suggestions please don't hestitate to mail them to me at
wakkerma@debian.org.
If there is sufficient interest in strace development I'll create a
mailinglist for it.
You can get strace at two locations:
 * homepage at 
http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/strace/
 * CVS archive at :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/strace,
