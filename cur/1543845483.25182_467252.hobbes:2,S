In this case of course I don't expect you to root through the trivial box and pull out my patches, but maybe this isn't the best way for me to submit them in the first place?  It seems like a particularly small and unnecessary window for somebody to update text files in.  Is there a different tree or maintainer that would be better suited for this type of thing?
I'm not talking about breaking code, I'm talking about breaking
_patch context_.
I have no problem with you sending your patches through subsystem 
maintainers or Andrew.
