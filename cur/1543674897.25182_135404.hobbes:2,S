Talking about tagged queueing - does the SCSI layer still remove the
request from the request list when it starts executing it?
At least historically that's a major mistake, and generates a crappy 
elevator, because it removes information from the block layer about where 
the disk is (or is going to be).
I know Andrew thinks that SCSI tagged queuing is a bunch of crap, and he 
has the latency numbers to prove it. He blames the SCSI disks themselves, 
but I think it might be the fact that SCSI makes it impossible to make a 
fair queuing algorithm for higher levels by hiding information.
Has anybody looked at just removing the request at command _completion_ 
time instead? That's what IDE does, and it's the _right_ thing to do.
I'd hate for SATA to pick up these kinds of mistakes from the SCSI layer.
