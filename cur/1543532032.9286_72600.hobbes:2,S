Martin,
couple of things...
The functions in pci.c don't internally protect the bus and device
lists, so access serialisation must be performed externally.  How do you
recommend this be done, and what should driver auditors be looking out
for in this regard?
Also, could you please remove the trigraphs-in-comments from pci.h
sometime?  Development versions of gcc produce zillions of warnings on
pci.h.  s/(??)/(?)/
Thanks.
