Ext2 has a preallocation mechanism so that if you have multiple
writes, they get dealt with to some extent as a single allocation.
However, that doesn't work over close(): the preallocated blocks are
discarded wheneven we close the file.
The problem with mail files, though, is that they tend to grow quite
slowly, so the writes span very many transactions and we don't have
that opportunity for coalescing the writes.  Actively defragmenting on
writes is an alternative in that case.
Cheers,
 Stephen
