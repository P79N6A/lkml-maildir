It turns out to be a sparc64 bug, technically, in my case.
What happens is that with -Os gcc _INLINES_ schedule() into
wait_for_completion().  No that's not a typo, when optimizing
for space it inlines a huge function like schedule() whereas
without -Os it does not. :-/
Anyways, switch_to() in sparc64 (and sparc) does not work properly
when this happens.  schedule() needs to execute in it's own stack
frame for the stack switching in switch_to() to work.
Would anyone be against adding "noinline" to kernel/sched.c:schedule()?
I'm about to test that, but I'm extremely positive that it makes the
problem go away.
