It seems to be not present in 2.2.12.
The bug was present in 2.2.7 and I mailed to tytso@mit.edu on 10 May and
it (bug) seems to have disappeared but now we have something even more
interesting. Attempt to use the "-o loop=/dev/loop0" syntax as in:
dd if=/dev/zero of=image bs=4096 count=1000
mke2fs image
mount -t ext2 -o loop=/dev/loop0 image /mnt
results in a massive (infinite?) amount of messages in kernel log saying 
"hm, busy page invalidated? (not necesserily a bug)\n" coming from
invalidate_inode_pages() of mm/filemap.c (this is 2.3.19). Note that I do
NOT get all these messages if do losetup /dev/loop0 image first and then
mount -t ext /dev/loop0 /mnt.
A different topic, of course - but something worth looking at,
nevertheless. Anyway, you convinced me - I went back to redhat default
static /etc/mtab. I only disliked it because it seemed like a waste of a
few CPU cycles creating it on each boot. But if there are reasons to have
it - so be it.
Thank you,
Tigran.
