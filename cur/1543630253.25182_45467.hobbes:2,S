Hi
I am trying to add a few new sytem calls to my linux kernel through
modules.
After I install the module using insmod, some times, the kernel panics
with the message -
	"Attempted to kill idle task - not syncing"
Some times, I am getting the message -
	"Attempted to kill Interrupt handler - not syncing"
Could someone tell me what kind of problem this is??
I am wondering if this is a problem with synchronization in kernel. I am
disabling and enabling interrupts before updating the sys_call_table as
follows:
	save_flags();
	cli();
	.
	.
	.
	sti();
	restore_flags();
Could there be some problem with the above sequence? Could some one
suggest me the correct way of disabling interrupts before updating
sys_call_table.
Thank you in advance.
regards
Madhavi.
