Hello all,
I am running kernel 2.2.5-22 with RH 6.0 x86 on 
AMD K6-2 333MHz 80MBRAM and 4GB HDD. 
Sometimes when I am running for instance netscape or x11amp for 3h or
more the memory is absorbed all (80MB RAM) and after when I am closing
the guilty application for some reasons the memory is still absorbed. So
the system does not 
free the memory.
This sounds like a memory leak but how I can count or measure this ?
Thanks,
stef
