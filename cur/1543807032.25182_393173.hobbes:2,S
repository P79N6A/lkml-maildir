So?
My point stands - if the user can provide an arbitary string to printk,
they can fake any kernel message.  That in itself is a security bug.
If there is an instance of that, then that's the real bug which would
need fixing.
Once those bugs have been fixed, your claimed bug is also magically
fixed.
