    Win98 using FAT32 and NT 5 Beta 3 on NTFS seam fine here on large hard
drives and do not complain when being installed on partitions that span the
1023 cylinder boundery, however I do not know about all systems.
Considering the wide use of defragmenters I would think the installer would
at least warn of possible errors, unless the Windows filesystems ensure that
their kernels are kept below 1024.  If thats the case it may not be a bad
idea to have similar functionality in the next Linux filesystem.

    Anybody know where I can get information on the extended BIOS calls?
While LILO may not be easily modifiable to boot after the 1023rd cylinder in
all cases, I suspect that most cases in which the problem may appear can be
covered by a LILO that support the extended BIOS call.  Since this problem
really only affects > 8GB drives (as LBA no longer can adjust the number of
cylinders below 1024), which themselves are only supported by the latest
BIOSes who probably have resolved any bugs or problems with their extended
BIOS calls.
