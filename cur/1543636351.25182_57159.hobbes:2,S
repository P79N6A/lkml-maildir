It can be fixed in kernel too, it's just that the effort would be poorly
spent at this point.  This is in roughly the same category as process-level
paging policy: yes, if it's implemented properly the VM appears to work
better and users will post nice things on lkml about it, but it's a red
herring.  Such adjustments are better left for later in the cycle, when
the smoke has cleared from the basic merge, and benchmarks should focus
narrowly on behaviour that is actually affected by the change in scanning
strategy.
