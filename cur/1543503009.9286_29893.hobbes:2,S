No, I was talking about vmalloc. Thinking about it some more, I think
I was confusing virtual and physical adressing space. You're only
talking about the physical adressing space. Now, virtual adressing space
is also a scarce resource. 
So, would it make sense to also put the virtual adressing space in a
resource tree? That's where my example belongs. 
Kernel virtual adressing space:
	0x00000000 - 0xc0000000  Current user process. 
	0xc0000000 - 0xc00a0000  main memory, below 640k
	0xc00a0000 - 0xc0100000  ISA io memory. 
	0xc0100000 - 0xc4000000  main memory, above 1Mb  (*)
	0xc4800000 - 0xc8800000  available for ioremap and vmalloc.  (*)
This picture would change if you configure for 2G RAM. 
If you're saying that ioremap doesn't currently have a "caller-name"
argument, I agree. But with a few macro tricks, it is easy to solve
this in a source-level compatible way. 
#define ioremap(p,l) nioremap(__FILE__, (p), (l))
(n for new or named- )
nioremap would then allocate the region from all the appropriate
resource (sub-)trees.

Ok, you're talking about the "physical" end of the mapping. I was
thinking about the virtual end of the mapping.

Very true ;)
