What apps are you talking about?

You don't need NIS or SMB before mounting the root disk.
If you want NFS to mount your root file system, you get the IP via DHCP
normally, so you don't need DNS.  And you can't get your own IP via DNS
because you need to have an IP to use DNS.

Please go ahead and implement it.
Fame and fortune await you! ;)

ELF is a standard.
You can't just go out and re-invent dynamic linking completely.
First and most importantly of all, the GNU toolchain support the ELF
standard, not my personal ELF dialect.  I have no desire to write a
linker.  I'm happy enough that I found Olaf who was willing to write an
ld.so (and I was close enough to hear all his ranting about how complex
ELF is).

Again, please do it.  I know that it would be possible.  But it would
not be standard and I don't think it's worth the effort.  The most
important reason is that static linking produces small binaries with the
diet libc and uclibc.  As long as your software does not destroy that by
having a few dozen mini binaries around, all linked against the same
monster do-it-all library, it works.
