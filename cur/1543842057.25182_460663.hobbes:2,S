I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly what ext3_get_blocks_handle
is trying to return, but it looks to me like if it is allocating one
data block, and needs to allocate an indirect block as well, then it
will return 2 rather than 1.  Is this expected, or am I just confused?

Bad to do this what it's doing, or bad to call name the variable "err"?
I think if it looked like this:
	count = ext3_get_blocks_handle(NULL, inode, blk, 1,
                                                &map_bh, 0, 0);
        if (count > 0) { 
it would be a lot less confusing.
