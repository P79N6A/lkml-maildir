I guess in the above case there's no problem because the reads are not
reordered. I guess a read become speculative only if there's a write
before the read.

That's not a problem. You have no garantee that the instruction will
happen at line XXX. So if it happens at XXX and you see it at YYY, you can
just assume the CPU executed the instruction at line YYY and you can as
well ignore the write buffer.
But if a read happens between XXX and YYY, then - to preserve processor
ordering - the hardware should invalidate such a speculative read if
another CPU changed the value that we read in speculative mode before YYY.
It seems to me the speculative read is not invalidated.
The point is that a read should be considered speculative (waiting to be
invalidated) until the write is _visible_ to all the other CPUs.
