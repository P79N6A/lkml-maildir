The X31 has an ATI Mobility Radeon as well, but I don't think it is a
9000. I will double check that when I get home tonight though.

I do have the Wlan card and I e-mailed Scott McLaughlin about it. His
response at the time was that Intel was still pondering what they would
do about the drivers. I assume that a gentle stream of plesant e-mails
to the appropriate place at Intel asking nicely for the drivers could
result in the drivers coming available.
The SuSE 2.4.20 kernel does not appear to get along with the X31's
graphics card. I will grab the latest 2.4.21-* kernel and give that a
try. Oh, and the GATOS drm drivers had a decidedly negative impact when
I tried them. I stopped X, removed radeon.o, copied the new radeon.o in
place, started X and experienced a hard hang. Interesting side-effect.
I have bookmarked that page, and I will look in on it now and then. I
should perhaps perform similar documentation for the X31 in case others
try to get Linux working on one.

Have you seen things like 'hdparm -d1 -X69' failing and telling you that
the actions fail and/or are not allowed? Would you agree that this could
be a side-effect of things you listed not being known to the kernel?
