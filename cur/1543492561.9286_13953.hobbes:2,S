No overloading, please! If you do that, I can just walk in with a tarfile
from somewhere else, or a NFS mounted filesystem, containing a doctored
binary that grants _everything_.

This is fine, as long as there is a way of doing what capabilities mandate
_without_ all-powerful root (or login(8), or getty(8), or whatever) doing
it all, or having anything to do with the whole mess. Concentrate on where
