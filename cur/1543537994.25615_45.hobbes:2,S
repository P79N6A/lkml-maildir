I fully respect your opinion (both professional and otherwise) about
how hard it is to do.
However, I think it would also be an incredibly great thing to do
(i.e. totally worth doing) if it were really possible to accomplish it
in the context of Linux' many other strengths. This is precisely where
BeOS, for example, falls down: phenomenal scheduling response, but
poorer support for all the other good stuff that Linux folk are used to.

And as I've said, one dropout every few days is fine with almost
everyone. There's very little equipment in the studio I work in that
doesn't have some kind of hiccup like that.

Goal A is my goal. Goal B is "a bunch of crap" as various participants
here would put it.

OK, so Victor: is it your considered, humble and professional opinion
that it would be impossible to offer, lets say, 1 failure per 4 hours
of a 2ms interrupt-driven reschedule response time without
implementing "full hard real-time" in the kernel ?
Suppose that we add a couple of assumptions:
	* the only threads that matter are SCHED_FIFO
	* those threads run in mlockall() address spaces (i.e. no
	      paging of any part of their address space)
	* the number of other runnable threads never rises above N
Do such assumptions make it any easier ? This is important, because in
many of the situations where audio/MIDI folk would be using this
stuff, these (or similar) assumptions are easy to meet.

No dispute here. That wasn't my point. I was trying to point out that
contrary to some of the claims here, it seems possible to me to solve
this without creating an RTOS. I don't think anybody would consider
IRIX an RTOS, but my understanding is that it can offer scheduling
responses on the order of what we are talking about here.
Again, I am not advocating a fully-preemptable approach. Larry and
other IRIX folk have made the pain of that development effort very
clear, as well as the costs. Its more that I want to try to flush out
the different ways to accomplish the same thing. Larry has claimed
that you couldn't get the performance we need without either
     1) making Linux into something very RTLinux-like, OR
     2) adding preemption points all over the place
If (1) is the only alternative to (2), I would be happy, as I said
before, to take on some level of responsibility for organizing, or
helping to organize, the maintainance and development of Ingo's
patches so that low-latency requiring people can use solution (2) on
more or less any kernel.
The other notable player in all this, of course, is
MontaVista. However, since they don't seem terribly concerned about
getting their work into the mainstream kernel, its not clear that its
that relevant to the problem at hand.
