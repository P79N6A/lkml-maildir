Actually, I take that back. attach is the wrong nomenclature as well for 
the action. 'match' would be more correct.
The entry point is the opportunity for the bus to compare a device ID with
a list of IDs that a particular driver supports. It's a 'compare' or
'match' operation. At this point, the driver is not attaching to the
device; it's only checking that's its ok to attach.
So, how about naming it 'match', and changing the 
{driver,device}_{,un}bind() in drivers/base/core.c to 
{driver,device}_{,un}attach() (since those are what is doing the 
attachment)?
The entire process, though, I think is still best described as "Driver 
Binding", as it is a common, modern term for what's happening.
