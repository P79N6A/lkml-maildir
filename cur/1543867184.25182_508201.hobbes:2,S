Ok a flash disk should be more stable

The hard disk one isn't guaranteed or stable but the flash especially if
it is aimed at it ought to behave.

All physical side if they are on the same controller when you do the
tests. Mostly latency,

Does the FreeBSD fsync sync to media ? Also what controller is being used
here, and do you have EHCI USB support running ?

I suspect the SATA-1 itself may not be the decider but something else -
eg the hard disk using NCQ, which would cover up any latency related
problems.

And ext3 in writeback mode ought in theory (but practice is always
harder ;)) be faster than ext2.
