Ah, I missed the semantics of WCOUNTER.  True, writer's open should 
always release the reader' s open (as Alan pointed out).
I do have a test application, which experienced dead-locked readers' 
opens before I artificially delayed writers' closes. The application 
runs on PlanetLab, which uses VServer, though. I'll try to construct 
next a minimal test case based on the application and reproduce the 
behavior on a vanilla box...
