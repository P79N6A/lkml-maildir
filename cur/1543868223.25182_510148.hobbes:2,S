Very well put.  That doctrine is sometimes known as "mise en scene",
and is every bit as applicable to software as to any other sort of
creative work.  When, that is, the software has characters, setting,
theme, etc.  See Micro Star v. Formgen (available anywhere Google hits
are sold).

Yes, people claim these things.  It's just that they're wrong.  Read
Lexmark.  Read the First Circuit opinion in Lotus v. Borland.  For
some really eye-opening dialogue, read the transcript of oral argument
before the Supreme Court in the Lotus v. Borland certioriari
proceeding.  For some long-winded but cogent discourse, read the
amicus curiae brief of the League for Programming Freedom in Lotus v.
Borland, submitted to the Supremes by one Eben Moglen.  If you can
read that and still tolerate the stench of the FSF's argument that
linking against readline means they 0wn your source code, you have a
stronger stomach than I.

"Possible" doesn't mean "practical".  Compare Galoob and Micro Star,
Atari v. Nintendo and Sega v. Accolade.  There's a fine line, and
Judge Sutton walked up one side of it and down the other, and his
fellow panelists ably advocated drawing it either to the left or to
the right of where he had.  When the Supremes denied cert. -- in a
case where the appellate court had vacated and remanded to the
district court, meaning that they had to demonstrate that the lower
court had erred _as_a_matter_of_law_ -- they endorsed Judge Sutton's
reading of the record.  Lexmark is now settled law.
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") on a binary-only turd is -- insofar as you can
demonstrate to the court of fact that it resembles the Lexmark fact
pattern, anywhere in the US -- as legal as an 8.5" x 14" pad of yellow
paper.  IANAL, TINLA.

I mean this in the nicest possible way:  Think again.
