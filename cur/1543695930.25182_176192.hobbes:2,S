Ok, started looking at the tmscsim. A couple of questions:
1) After the "next" element has disappeared from the struct scsi_cmnd,
what is the "correct" / preferred way to queue scsi commands in drivers?
I saw aic7xxx (new) casting a part of struct scsi_pointer SCp in
scsi_cmnd, starting from Status to a list_head (or an anology thereof),
which doesn't seem very nice. Anyway, I didn't find any "standard" way for
doing this. Should host_scribble be used?
2) Actually, which scsi driver (or, better, several drivers) can be
considered well-written and can be taken as examples? I tried looking at
aic7xxx, as it is a pretty new one, but I am not sure if it is really a
good example to follow and it is pretty big too.
Thanks

P.S. Should this thread be taken to linux-scsi or is it better to continue
it on lkml?
