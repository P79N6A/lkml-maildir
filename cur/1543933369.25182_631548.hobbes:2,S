Good point.
OTOH, we *do* have a flag for the extended capabilities - dev->cfg_size.
Obviously, the pci probe *without* mmconfig will set it to 256 for *all*
devices.
So Linus' idea of enabling mmconfig per-device makes a lot of sense in the
end - if mmconfig works, it just sets dev->cfg_size to 4096.
Without bloating the struct pci_dev or screwing up innocent arches...
Ivan.
