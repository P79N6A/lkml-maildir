I think that you have to keep in mind the way disk (and other media) 
fail. You can get media failures after a successful write or errors that 
pop up as the media ages.
Not to mention the way most people run with write cache enabled and no 
write barriers enabled - a sure recipe for corruption.
Of course, there are always software errors to introduce corruption even 
when we get everything else right ;-)
 From what I see, media errors are the number one cause of corruption in 
file systems. It is critical that fsck (and any other tools) continue 
after an IO error since they are fairly common (just assume that sector 
is lost and do your best as you continue on).
