Have a look at the code in arch/arm/mach-ixp4xx/common-pci.c, in
the function ixp4xx_pci_preinit().
It does a check on whether the PCI bus is configured as HOST or not.
I don't know if that code support is enough for it all to work right
though (I certainly haven't tried it on either the 425 or 465...)
Regards
Greg
