But you have to parse any other naming scheme, including a sysctl()-based
one.  And the kernel can't reasonably generate every possible representation
of the device tree, whether by devfs, SYS$GETDVI(), /proc files, etc.

Why wouldn't it be?  In its most generalized form, a filesystem is a
hierarchical database used for kernel-to-userspace communication, which is
why Plan 9 generalized it to namespaces and why there is e.g. /proc.  It
seems ridiculously narrow to restrict filesystems to handling only real
"files":  where do you draw the line?  Network filesystems?  Devices
themselves (shades of DEC OSes)?

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
