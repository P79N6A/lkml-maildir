Perhaps you haven't hit some of the more recent standards that place 
more of a burden on the ap implementation?  Also some vendor-specific 
protocol features suck up space for ap mode only and it is nice to be 
able to include them only as needed.
There are several advantages to splitting up the code such as reduced 
audit complexity and real space savings but I agree that it is an open 
question whethere there's a big gain to modularizing the code by 
operating mode.
