Now that 2.3.25 is out and contains Tigran's bfs I suppose there
is no point in a detailed comparison. Roughly speaking they are
very similar (just modified versions of minixfs or romfs).
The first implementation has a small flaw (easily fixed) in the
handling of empty files. I am not aware of any flaw in the second one.
Tigran says that the third one was written with the SCO source
at hand - this worries me a little, but apparently Linus sees
no objection.
