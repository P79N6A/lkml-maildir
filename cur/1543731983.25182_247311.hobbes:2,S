  I have a question about job. If I understand how it works, you can not
add a process in a job. I mean when you start a session, a container is 
created and it's the only way to create it. If I'm right, I think that it 
could be interesting to add a process using ioctl and /proc interface. For
example, if I want to know how resources are used by a compilation, I
need to add the process gcc in a container. Any comments? 
Best,
Guillaume
