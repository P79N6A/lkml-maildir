Ha - and you didnt even tell me you had this patch out.
Looks good.
You forgot to correct the do_div.
The part I most object to are things like
> +	id->lba_capacity_2 = capacity_2 = set_max_ext;
There have been many problems in the past, and it is a bad idea to add
more of this. We should be eliminating all cases.
I mean: 
We have info from BIOS, user, disk etc and conclude to a certain geometry.
Sneakily changing what the disk reported is very ugly. I recall a case
where a disk bounced between two capacities because the value that this
computation concluded to was not a fixed point. Also, the user gets an
incorrect report from HDIO_GET_IDENTITY.
So, the clean way is to examine what the disk reported, never change it
(except for the part
--------------------------------------------------------------
void ide_fix_driveid (struct hd_driveid *id)
{
#ifndef __LITTLE_ENDIAN
# ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN
        int i;
        u16 *shortcast;
        shortcast = (u16 *) id;
        for (i = 0; i < (sizeof(struct hd_driveid) / 2); i++)
                shortcast[i] = __le16_to_cpu(shortcast[i]);
# else
#  error "Please fix <asm/byteorder.h>"
# endif
#endif
}
--------------------------------------------------------------
that brings shorts into CPU order)
and store the results elsewhere. In particular, our conclusions
should go into drive->capacity and should not overwrite
id->lba_capacity.
