hi,
	the decay function can be modified by changing the
numbers. e.g. if you changed prev->avg_slice*1 to prev->avg_slice*2
then you would have to change the denominator to 3, and
that would slow the attack/decay rate of the function. 
You would expect these values to be defined in constants, but 
I guess no-one ever plays around with them, so they stay as 
they are.
cheers
Greg
