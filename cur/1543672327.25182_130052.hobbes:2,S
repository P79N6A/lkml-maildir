Subject: [PATCH] asm-generic magic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/6/28

The attached patch changes topdir/Makefile to make the asm-generic
stuff to work the way I assumed it was supposed to work.  :)
That is, if the file exists in .../include/asm/ use that one, if not 
and it exist in .../include/asm-generic/ use the generic one.  This is 
compatable with current conventions but also allows asm files that do 
nothing but include the asm-generic file with the same name to go 
away.  The "magic" is to supply both include and include/asm-generic 
to CPP.  This causes it, when looking for  <asm/foo.h> to look first 
in ...include/asm/ and then in .../include/asm-generic/asm.  To make 
the ladder work we put a link (called asm) in asm-generic to point to ".".
Commits?
