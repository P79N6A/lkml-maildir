Hi, I am back on this task... I hope I will have a working patchset soon.
I face an issue using the hrtimer instead of the old timer framework 
(your patch #4/6). It seems that I do not sample at a sufficient rate 
using hrtimer : I see squares when drawing circles ;-)
Do you know if the hrtimer framework has an issue on at91 or do I have 
to code something to have a low res timer support in the hrtimer framework ?
Cheers,
