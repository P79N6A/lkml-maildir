Subject: [PATCH] unusual_devs.h, kernel 2.6.15.6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/4/93

This patch adds an UNUSUAL_DEV entry which prevents a particular usb
drive from flooding the console with useless SCSI messages. It is
patterned after similar ones for other manufacturers. I also took the
opportunity to correct the order of entries, manufacturer 0x0451 was
out of order.
I thank David Härdeman for help with this one.
