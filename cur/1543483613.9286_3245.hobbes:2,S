Well, my Intel Neptune board with dual P120 doesn't reboot
with 2.2, but it did reboot with Linux 2.0 (according to
the previous owner).
This is very frustrating because a cold reboot means:
- no automatic reboots possible (make zlilo && init 6)
- I have to hand-boot via DOS in order to get the
  sound card working under Linux
- if the electricity fails I have to revive the machine
  by hand
