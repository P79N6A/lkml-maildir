Subject: 2.3.17: should FAT work?

Hi. I remember reading something in the past about FAT being
unstable/totally buggy in the 2.3-series. Is this still true? I'm asking
because yesterday for the first time I tried out 2.3 SMP, more precisely
2.3.17, and came up with a repeatable kernel freeze untarring to a VFAT
partition.
Everything in the machine freezes except Magic Sysrq. Well, Magic Sysrq
can only print out registers but can't for instance unmount nor reboot.
The EIP in the register dump isn't in the symbol file (c88* while all
the symbols are c00*). 2.2.12 is stable here. What gives?
