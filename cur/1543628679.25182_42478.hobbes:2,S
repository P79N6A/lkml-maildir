Hi,
I am experiencing quite heavy problems with DMA on IDE disks on one older 
piece of hardware. Output from /proc/pci attached at the end of mail.
If I don't turn off DMA on all IDE disks, after quite a short while after 
bootup (commonly during run of /sbin/init), I get many error messages of 
all kinds (some programs segfault, for example), and after bootup my 
console gets filled (cca 1 message per minute, not under heavy disk 
access) with such messages:
init_special_inode: bogus imode(0)
(imode followed by different numbers, but 0 is the most common).
Tried on kernel 2.4.9 from RedHat (there I get SeekError messages, instead
of those mentioned above), 2.4.16, 2.4.18, I've heard that it happens to
someone even with 2.4.19-pre7, but I haven't tested it myself yet.
After I again boot with DMA turned off, fsck complains a lot (orphaned 
inodes, orphaned linked lists, bad file attributes, etc.), after repairing 
some of the files fsck mentioned are lost forever, /lost+found is filled 
with many entries, etc).
Here is complete /proc/pci from that computer
PCI devices found:
  Bus  0, device   0, function  0:

I've searched archives of LKML, but didn't find any solution. Thnaks in 
advance for your replies.
