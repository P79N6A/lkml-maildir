True, I agree here.

I was actually hoping for a suggestion like this when I posted this
patch earlier. Can one really just unset CONFIG_ options that have
previously been set? I'd actually prefer this, but doing so generated a
.config that looked like:
CONFIG_X86_TSC=y
...
# CONFIG_X86_TSC is not set
So I assumed CONFIG_X86_TSC would still hold. Am I wrong, or is there
another way to do this?
Thanks
