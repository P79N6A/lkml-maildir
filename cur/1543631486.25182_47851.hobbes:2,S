I used it for I2C on VGA cards and different ISA devices,
and flash programming. Remember that though ISA went away on
desktop, embedded people still use it. It was just FYI - if you
persuade Linus to strike /dev/port down, I am not going to shed
many tears, only a little :)  It may be different for users
of languages other than C, but let them defend themselves.
