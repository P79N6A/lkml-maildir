The price is paid only if you select RTL in config.
my idea is that system.h does
#define do_not_use_this_cli_directly() __asm__("cli")
#ifndef RTL_CONFIG
#define __cli() do_not_use_this_clu_directly()
...
#else
struct irq_control ...
Even with the indirect jump
Lmbench can't detect any performance loss -- remember that cli and sti
are not cheap instructions anyways.
RTL should actually show a slight gain, because in operation __cli and
__sti will be
call x
set memory value
return
which is cheaper on a modern processor than __asm__("cli");

The "int"  would cost too much in the rtl case. On
the other hand, I had thought of 
of a section.  Not sure what the advantage would be. With the structure,
the compiler generates
movel N+irq_desc,%eax
call *%eax
