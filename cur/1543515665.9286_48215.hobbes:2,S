I didn't see the words "quantum" or "teleological" in the license. :-)
AAAh, but now I see your point.  It's possible to place the non-GPL but
GPL-compatible work under the GPL (with no other changes) *before*
integrating it with reiserfs.  At that point reiserfs permits the
integration.
Of course, that's fine.
