FYI there was a patch running around last April that made a new option 
for "dd" to make it use O_DIRECT. You can get it here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108135935629589&w=2
Unfortunately this hasn't made it into coreutils. IIRC there were issues 
about dd being multi-platform and the way O_DIRECT was done in other 
systems.
Anyway, you can patch dd yourself and have a tool for debugging with 
O_DIRECT. I hope this helps,
