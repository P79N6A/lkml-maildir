the simplest patch to avoid pte in highmem is this. It's against 19pre7aa3
but it will apply cleanly to the kernel you're using.

However if I would be in you I'd simply add mem=850M to the append line
in /etc/lilo.conf until the vmmon/vmnet update is released, that should
be the most confortable approch from your part.

Hmm looking at the bounce_end_io_read it looks like the kernel didn't
recognized you specified mem=850M via lilo, not idea why. You should
check with `free` that your kernel is using only 850M of ram before
starting vmware. Can you show the contents of /proc/meminfo right after
boot?
