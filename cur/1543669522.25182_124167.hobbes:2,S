There is a requirement for certain bit in the MSB to be set, bit 6 of 7
iirc. 
Also, there is an issue with ifconfig and TR. During the 2.3 dev kernels
we changed the IEEE type of TR from 6 to a value in the 800 range. This
was done when multicast support was added as we needed to split out TR
from the other 802 protocols. 
ifconfig and friends didn't realize this and barf because the return
type is wrong. I've tried submitting patches to net-tools for this 
several times, but it wasn't fixed. It may be by now, but don't quote me
on it.
