I have some additional changes, but they should not affect this...
OTOH, I probably used this script:
killall hciattach
sleep .1
setserial /dev/ttyBT baud_base 921600
hciattach -s 921600 /dev/ttyS0 bcsp
hciconfig hci0 up
hciconfig hci0 name billionton
hciconfig /dev/ttyUB1
...even through there's no bluetooth at ttyS0 (as this machine has
bluetooth on usb).
