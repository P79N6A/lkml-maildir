The lists would constitute the tasks that wait4() should consider, at
least.    And maintaining the list wouldn't be any more work than the
current reparenting. I do admit that I don't see a significant win,
codewise, other than aesthetics.
In looking at the code I was wondering something.  What happens to the real
parent of a ptraced task when it calls wait4()?  If that's its only child,
won't it return ECHILD?
