    Are you saying that you don't have to partition single volume drives?  You
    can just run mke2fs on the raw device?  Like this.
    mke2fs /dev/sdb
    mount /dev/sdb /mnt/morespace
Yes, you can.
It may confuse some installation scripts, and you cannot have LILO
there, but there is no need for partitions.  It is just a 80 GB floppy :-)
