I'm well aware of that, even in the example I wrote to reproduce the issue
and posted to gcc's bugzilla, I clearly have one function prototype and a
separate asm statement which contained a label with the function's name.
So in my opinion, the code above is not buggy. It's dirty (though I did
not find how to produce the equivalent in a different manner).
