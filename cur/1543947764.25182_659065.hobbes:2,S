Same here!  When I got ENOSPC from truncate, trying to free some
space, I was so surprised (and a bit disappointed) that I assumed
removal could fail too.  So now I'm pleasantly surprised to learn I
can at least remove a file.
It does seem odd that truncate to zero length can fail.  It is
guaranteed to free up one or more data nodes, so there should be
enough space for the size change node, provided GC is invoked when
necessary and the node sizes are compatible for this in corner cases.
