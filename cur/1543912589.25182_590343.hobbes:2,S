That is utterly inconsistent and confusing too.
If you have a filesystem "/foo" exported on the server "remote", then
why should
        mount -oro remote:/foo
        mount -orw remote:/foo/a
be allowed, but
        mount -oro remote:/foo
        mount -orw remote:/foo
be forbidden? The caching problems are the same. Telling the admin that
one is safe and the other is not, is just messing with his mind.
