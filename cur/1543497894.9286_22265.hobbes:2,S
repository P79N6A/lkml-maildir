Reproduced on my 2.2.9/i386. Program does something different than it
claims to (due to limited ranges of ints etc), but causes
corruption. When I did ls -l c after run I saw rwx-----T or something
this crazy. I tried it twice, worked both times.
If you don't want to trash your harddisk, be sure to sync; killall
bdflush; sync; run test; look what it caused and then _POWER OFF
WITHOUT SYNCING_.
