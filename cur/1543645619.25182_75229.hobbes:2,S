Yes, sure. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough - the point is whether those
tty_driver write/write_room() calls are allowed to sleep or not. If yes,
the usbserial implementation is right and it is impossible to do further
writing directly from write_wakeup() callback (which would be really bad
IMHO) - if not, usbserial needs to avoid the down() somehow.
