Sorry - the kernel hangs, not crashes. There is no output whatsoever 
after the hang - SysRq doesn't work, but Numlock does.

Perhaps - I'm in discussion with them at the moment, but neither our, 
nor their department have managed to come up with an answer yet.

Thats interesting, but wouldn't this produce strange side affects for 
the 2.4 kernel as well? 2.4 works fine on both VIAs and Celerons.

I'll give the interrupt disabling a go...
Thanks Alan.
