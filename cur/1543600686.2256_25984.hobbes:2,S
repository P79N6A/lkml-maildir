It _does_ work for that case, and you just aren't reading my emails.
You only need to invalidate the device if the open was a read-write open.
It would be _stupid_ to force a writeback and device invalidate for
read-only opens, now wouldn't it?
The fact that you cannot know the difference between a read-only and a
read-write open is _entirely_ due to the fact that you leave the flush
until the last close. If you do it at every close (like I have said for
the last twohundred mails or so), you can trivially see if the open was a
read-only or not.
