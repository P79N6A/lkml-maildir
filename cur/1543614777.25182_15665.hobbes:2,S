Oh, by the way, the "I need to use zImage on my Tecra" thing is making
it work by the use of voodoo.  It's rather unfortunate it worked on
some systems -- it's going to fail randomly on you anyway; it's just a
matter of which way the timings and cache items get jerked around.
I have asked Alan for more details on the workaround, but perhaps the
thing to do is to backport the latest 2.4 A20 code back to 2.2 and see
if that solves the *real* problem, so bzImage works.
I don't think there is any reason to believe zImage doesn't work
unless bzImage works on your system.
