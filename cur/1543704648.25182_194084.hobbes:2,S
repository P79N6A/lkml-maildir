Well isn't userspace's idea of topology just what the kernel tells it?
I'm not sure what it would buy you... but I guess it wouldn't be too
much harder than doing it in kernel, just a matter of making the userspace
API.
BTW. I guess you haven't seen my sched domains code. It can describe
arbitrary topologies.
