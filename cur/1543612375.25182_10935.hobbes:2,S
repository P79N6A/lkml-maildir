  Well, according to the man page, mister Walberg is right. How can I
  force mlockall to page in the entire process ? And if it is possible,
  I guess it won't resolve my problem since it is the filesystem which
  refuses to release the blocks, right ?
  To be more precise, here is my situation: the executable file is
  located on a ramfs filesystem. Once it is started, I would like to get
  the space back so that the RAM can be used. Is there a clean solution ?
  P.S: on behalf of Cyrille (who made the first post), I would like to
  thank you for your answers, it is greatly appreciated.
  P.P.S: is it required to include the people involved in the thread in
  the Cc: field ? I have looked in the mailing list FAQ and have not
  found the reason.
