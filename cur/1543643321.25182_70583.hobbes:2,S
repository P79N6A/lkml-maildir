If you have this problem w/ the -ac patches or any other version, I want
to know.  Please contact offline as I will ask you to send a list of
information.  There is a lot of noise and I am searching for the signal
part of the issue.
I can only find two settings which can cause the issue predictable.
hdparm -c2 or -c3 /dev/hdX
I can not reproduce the lost interrupts at some of the reported rates
recently.  I can produce them under certain situations, but not at a
predicatble rate.  This is not a simple race to find.
It is looking like a possible OS v/s device race for interrupt delivery.
More likely the device issues the interrupt w/ out the handler being
armed.
