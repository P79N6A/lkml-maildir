I haven't had any replies so far, and it was suggested that I also fish on LKML
for input.
Thanks,

Subject: [KJ] ftape/fdc-io: schedule_timeout() usage
Hello,
I'm hoping someone here can help me correct some ftape code.
drivers/char/ftape/lowlevel/fdc-io.c::fdc_interrupt_wait() contains the
following code:
set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
add_wait_queue((&ftape_wait_intr, &wait);
while (!ft_interrupt_seen && (current->state == TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)) {
	timeout = schedule_timeout(timeout);
}
The problem I have is that after the first iteration of the loop
(schedule_timeout() with TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE), it will become a busy-wait, as
schedule_timeout() will be running with current->state set to TASK_RUNNING. I'm
not sure if this is desired, but it seems weird to me. Any input would be
appreciated.
-Nish
