This isn't any good since it implies that a given uid can only have a
single set of tokens. Users can freely authenticate to afs and get
tokens for other afs ids at any time. As long as they are in different
pags, they can freely coexist. Now, if you're talking about pag-less
only, then the above is reasonable and expected.
