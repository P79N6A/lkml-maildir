Thats ok - now they are doing GPL drivers themselves they don't need
you any more.
Promise did a SCSI CAM driver because their hardware can queue commands
without TCQ - which drivers/ide can't cope with. Otherwise I'd just have
used the same type of changes the FreeBSD people did for 2037x.
Its also interesting because it has a hardware XOR engine.
