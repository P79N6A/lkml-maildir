Hi Mark,
It could be cache contention which I think is typically the reason
hyperthreading can hurt performance. Its basically impossible for
the scheduler to correct this automatically (access to performance
counters might make it slightly less impossible).
Probably the CPU hotplug interface would enable a tool to effectively
turn HT on or off and it would be up to an administrator to tune
performance.
You could try my scheduler patchset if you like. I have recently got
HT support working (its against test11, you need to turn CONFIG_SMT
on), although if Ingo's patch doesn't help much, mine probably won't
either.
