Sorry, there was some confusion then, maybe I misunderstood one of your

Just ignoring GFP_DMA in the allocator seems like a horrible violation
to me. GFP_DMA means "give me memory from ZONE_DMA". We're both well
aware that the whole concept of ZONE_DMA doesn't make much sense, but
still, that's what it does.
So if you just put all of memory in ZONE_DMA for your particular
machine, and bumped the DMA limit up to infinity, we wouldn't need
any of these patches, right? Which would also match what the other
arches do for this (eg PPC64).
Seems like a much simpler way of solving the problem to me. Or do you
think that won't work for some reason?
