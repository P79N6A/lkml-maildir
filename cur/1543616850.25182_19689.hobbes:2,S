Who says you're going to be enabling IRQs any time soon?  AFAIK, there is
nothing that requires enable_irq to be called after disable_irq_nosync.
In fact, you could well have the following in a driver:
	/* initial shutdown of device */
	disable_irq_nosync(i); /* or disable_irq(i); */
	/* other shutdown stuff */
	free_irq(i, private);
and you would have to audit all drivers to find out if they did this -
this would seriously damage your preempt_count.
