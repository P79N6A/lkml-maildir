While compiling 2.3.48 i made a typo, I wrote make -j modules instead of
make-j4 modules, I hit intro and later when I came back I could saw that
X was frozen after a few seconds of the start of the compile, load of
3.3 instead of two or three dozillions, but my hd was scratching like a
mad, and after about 45 mins, the box froze and stop reponding to pings,
BTW I tried to telnet into, but no luck, I think the box was too busy.
These are the last messages in /var/log/messages and the box has two
200mmx, 96mb of ram and 198 of swap.
