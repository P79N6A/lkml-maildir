Doh! You're right, and I am so glad you caught it. I tried to refactor
some code from the original patch and one line was lost in the battle :(

This is exactly the patch I sent for -stable (as 2.6.16 is affected
too.) This is also what the i2c-i801 driver was doing up to 2.6.15,
inclusive.
However I thought using the proper driver model callbacks would be
better for 2.6.17, for the following reasons:
* Nothing currently prevents the user from suspending or rebooting the
system while there is a transaction in progress. If this happens, the
callbacks are needed to clear and restore the PEC bit; resetting at the
end of the transaction won't work.
* Small performance benefit, although I admit it's a last resort
consideration.
Also note that, even if we disable PEC after each transaction, the user
can still leave the system in a broken state by hitting the reset
button during a transaction. This is less likely to happen than if we
disable PEC in .suspend and .shutdown, but it can still happen. The
only way to fix that is to get the BIOS itself fixed, which is out of
our hands.
Anyway, on second thought I believe you're right, the most simple
approach will be fine for 2.6.17 too. There's little point in trying
to handle suspend/resume if we don't prevent it from happening in the
middle of a transaction. Fixing that is beyond the scope of 2.6.17.
I'll send a new patch soon.
