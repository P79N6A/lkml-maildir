Hmmm,
sorry to have started this one off !
I am now running a UP kernel on the Dell poweredge 1300. No problems, no
crashes, it talks to the u-beaut UW-whatever SCSI, talks to the Intel
network card and all.
I do have a Dell poweredge 2300 inside that is slated for use as an NT box
for work (excuse the blasphemy).
If I have time, I will swap disks, Oh, I can't the 2300 has a raid 'cage'
in it, I will see if I can cable up the disk from the 1300 and see what
happens.
I don't understand this APIC stuff, forgive me, I am a mere mortal but I do
recall the 2300 has a much larger and unusual motherboard compared to the
1300.
If I have time I will try out the UP kernel on the 2300 and report what
happens.
Regards,
Brad.
