Subject: [PATCH] kconfig/kbuild: fix dependency problem
Commit 2e3646e51b2d6415549b310655df63e7e0d7a080 changed the way
the split config tree is built, but failed to also adjust fixdep
accordingly - if changing a config option from or to m, files
referencing the respective CONFIG_..._MODULE (but not the
corresponding CONFIG_...) didn't get rebuilt.
This happens because tristate symbol has three values represented
by different CONFIG_ symbols:
=n => CONFIG_SYMBOL undefined
=y => CONFIG_SYMBOL equals 1
=m => CONFIG_SYMBOL_MODULE equals 1
But conf_split_config did not support the _MODULE syntax
and therefore no include/config/symbol/module.h file was
generated/touched when changing a symbol to/from m.
Thus make did nt pick up the change and rebuild failed.
This patch teaches conf_split_config to support the
_MODULE variant.
This fixes a problem reported by Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>.
arch/i386/kernel/apm.o revealed this bug.
Original fix was posted by:  "Jan Beulich" <jbeulich@novell.com>
which inspired this better fix.
