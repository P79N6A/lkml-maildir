Hi all,
i just bought a new 2x244 opteron,tyan tiger k8s 2870,
4gb registered ecc ram system. no addional cards
inserted, only one IDE and one SATA device.
i tried to run the setup with the original debian
kernel 2.6.6-1-k7-smp, but the system hangs right
after the line "initrd-tools: 0.1.69".
so i downloaded the sources for 2.6.6 and compiled
them myself, optimized for dual opteron. unluckily
exactly the same happens.
when i enable the apic 2.0 support in the bios, the
system hangs even ealier right after the first
"calibrating delay loop...".
when i boot the system with the "nosmp" and apic 2.0
disabled (normal apic still enabled) the system
hangs somewhere after "hda: max request size...".
the only way to get the system running is to fully
disable the apic support in the bios and run the
system with "nosmp". :-(((
additional info:
when i boot using the 2.4.26-k7-smp kernel, the system also
hangs. sometimes when saying "loading data into ramdisk.."
and sometimes later. one time a "decompression error..."
was displayed. when i boot using "nosmp", the system
boots fine. with the 2.4.26 kernel, i dont need to disable
APIC completely.
i hope that anyone could help me,
corin
