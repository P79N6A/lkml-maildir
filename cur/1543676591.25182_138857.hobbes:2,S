	For unconnected UDP sockets, I see no place for 'select'ing for write. No.

	It is fundamental that an application that sends UDP packets must control
the transmit timing. That's just the way it is with UDP.

	Right. It's silly to 'select' on an unconnected UDP datagram socket. There
is no single defined buffer whose fullness or emptiness can be the subject
of the 'select'ing. It's not like TCP where there's a send queue and the
network stack is responsible for transmit pacing. With UDP, the application
is responsible for transmit pacing.

	It really doesn't matter. UDP applications have to control the transmit
pacing at application level. There is absolutely no way for the kernel to
know whether the path to the recipient is congested or not.

	No, no no. This is not how you write UDP applications. If you're sending
UDP, you must have a transmit scheduler somewhere.

	The kernel can't tell you when to send because that depends upon factors
that are remote. The application *MUST* schedule its transmissions. There's
no two ways about it.
	Yes, it would be nice of the kernel helped more. But the application has to
deal with remote packet loss as well. It HAS TO decide when to send the
packet and can't rely upon the availability or unavailability of local
resources to mean anything with regard to the connection as a whole.
