Because that announcement was made months ago, and there is in fact server
code in the current i386_linux22 Transarc AFS (I don't know how functional it 
is, but I suspect that only "bos" works currently; Transarc was reportedly
slating the Linux server for later this summer).

Originally they provided access for AFS licensees to the unofficial MIT port
of the AFS client; they now have an official AFS 3.5 client, and as I said
the server is supposed to be available later this year.

Source release of AFS?  I sincerely doubt it.  Although it'd be nice to see
AFS return to its roots....
(Meanwhile there's always Arla.)

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
