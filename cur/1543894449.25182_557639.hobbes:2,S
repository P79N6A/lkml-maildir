Only if the filesystems are altered to use larger blocksizes and if the
operator then chooses to use that feature.  Then they suck for small-sized
(and even medium-sized) files.
So you're still talking about corner cases: specialised applications which
require careful setup and administrator intervention.
What can we do to optimise the common case?

Again: requires larger blocksize: specialised, uninteresting for what will
remain the common case: 4k blocksize.
The alleged fsck benefit is also unrelated to variable PAGE_CACHE_SIZE. 
It's a feature of larger (unweildy?) blocksize, and xfs already has that
working (doesn't it?)
There may be some benefits to some future version of ext4.
