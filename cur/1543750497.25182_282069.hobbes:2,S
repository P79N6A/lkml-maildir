(I'm replying to this message to keep it inside the original thread.
It should be noted that the subject is wrong and that it turns out
that the mouse is actually from Logitech and not Toshiba. Duh.)

Thanks, Dmitry. Setting proto=bare has returned the touchpad to it's
original behavior.
Just to be clear, here's what I've done:
If I compiled the psmouse driver into the kernel, I added a line to my
/etc/lilo.conf that looks like:
append="other_driver=option psmouse.proto=bare"
(the psmouse.proto=bare part is the only part really needed).
If I compiled the psmouse driver as a module (psmouse.o), then I added
the following to my /etc/modprobe.conf:
options psmouse proto=bare
then I can just 'modprobe psmouse' and the driver is installed.
Using the other options (imps and exps) didn't change the behavior
much. I had some strange issues with the cursor being occasionally
moved to the upper-right corner of the screen very quickly when I
dragged in the lower and the right sides of the touchpad. This
behavior, however, was not (yet) reproducible. If I can figure out how
to reproduce it reliably, I'll note it later.
Thanks.
