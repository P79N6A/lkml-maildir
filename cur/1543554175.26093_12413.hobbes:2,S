I have several boxen running sendmail with fair to moderate loading -
they even occasionally don't accept mail... and thats good, as it lets
the system catch up with its current load.  As soon as things stabalize,
sendmail again accepts connections - you *do* have MX entries don't you?
I've *never* had the problem you've got with *any* of the boxes - maybe
you should rethink your setup.  I'll wager that the qmail box isn't as
heavily loaded as the one running sendmail; why not split your services?

There are two types of Linux developers - those who can spell, and
those who can't. There is a constant pitched battle between the two.
