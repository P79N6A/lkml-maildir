Crap, sorry about that.  I'd just intended to send the overview and the
four patches, which have explicit CC: stable lines in the patch
descriptions.  They are:
Subject: [PATCH 06/12] xen: add batch completion callbacks
Subject: [PATCH 07/12] xen: deal with stale cr3 values when unpinning
pagetables
Subject: [PATCH 10/12] xen: fix incorrect vcpu_register_vcpu_info
hypercall argument
Subject: [PATCH 12/12] xfs: eagerly remove vmap mappings to avoid
upsetting Xen
