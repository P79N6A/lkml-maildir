Chuck,
The PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD is useful, because it allows you to
differentiate between a standard SIGTRAP and a system call entry or
exit.  For example, if you have a ptrace monitor and receive a SIGTRAP,
without O_SYSGOOD, it isn't clear if the kernel returned from wait (1)
because someone did kill -TRAP pid, or (2) the process was entering a
system call.
