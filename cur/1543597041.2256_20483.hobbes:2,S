Pat,
don't wanna be offensive, but: in my case it IS swapping heavily. if
somebody dares to reply again to me, that it's not, i am cordially invite
him/her to read my emails more thouroughly before i get a reply
like "it is not swapping, it is only appear to be swapping".
the docu/manpages and the utils like top/sar/vmstat and friends
should be updated asap. it's confusing and  *also* the reason why
some people might haven gotten numb about requests/problems like mine.
