As before people from LKML did not like to even talk about these bugs, 
I did stop after sending bug reports to LKML.

It is simple to find the SCSI commands that cdrecord by scanning the source (*),
but this is something that is subject to frequent change in case cdrecord needs
to add new MMC-4711 commands or in case that I need to add a new vendor unique
command in order to support special features.
