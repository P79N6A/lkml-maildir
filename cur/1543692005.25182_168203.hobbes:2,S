Thanks for your reply, Mikael. I will try that, when I back to the home.

CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
...
CONFIG_APM=m
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y #
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE is not set CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
You may suffer from a broken graphics card BIOS that hangs
if a local APIC timer interrupt arrives. I've seen this
happen on G400 and Radeons, and an old S3 I think.
Another issue, but not the one you're having, is that configuring APM=m is
known to hang some BIOSen at the point when the APM module is unloaded,
again due to BIOS code not handling local APIC interrupts.
Fix: Disable CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK. You don't need it.
Also set APM=y if you're going to have it at all.
(An alternative fix is to disable UP_APIC, but
only do that as a last resort.)
I also noticed you had enabled a lot of ACPI stuff.
This is almost certainly pointless on a BX board.
