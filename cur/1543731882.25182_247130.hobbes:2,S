No idea about that, but every time somebody reports problems with
the AIC7XXX driver with either in all uppercase, or lowercase
name in message subject, a dozen or so linux-kernel recipient systems
do react adversely with something like "keep your spam".
For number wildcarding,  "N" is usable in some cases.
e.g.  3w-9nnn  
I do urge you to consider rewriting configuration options, and file
names so that triple-x doesn't appear in them.
Both for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, as well.
