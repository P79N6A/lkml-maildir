? The same way you are doing it with pagecache.

WTF would we _need_ to know? Think about it as about memory caching. You
can cache by virtual address and you can cache by physical address. And
since we have no aliasing here... Andrea, consider the thing as VM. You
have virtual addresses (offsets in file for data, offsets in directory for
directory contents, beginning of covered range for indirect blocks, etc.)
and you have physical address (offset on a disk). You have mapping of VA
to PA (->bmap(), ->get_block()) (context being the file). Old scheme was
equivalent to caching by PA and recalculation of mapping on each use. New
sceme gives caching by context+VA and provides a working TLB. We already
have it for data. For metadata we are still caching by PA. And getting the
nasty pile of it with cache coherency. Would you like to work with MMU of
such architecture?

And? Don't use bread() on metadata. It should never enter the buffer hash,
just as buffer_heads of _data_ never enter it. Leave bread() for
statically allocated stuff.

You are kinda late with it - it's already done for data. The question
being: do we ever need lookups by physical address (disk location)?
AFAICS it is _not_ needed.

Right. And you may want different policies for data and metadata - the
latter should always be in kvm. AFAICS that's what SCT refered to.
