Hi,
	I have a megaraid 466 controller, which both ami and the linux
	kernel say is supported under 2.4.4, I tried the ami patches to
	the drivers in the vanilla kernel to no avail, the card works
	under windows...the card is even detected under linux now, but
	it refuses to show any drives and i cant get the management
	software to work. so my question is this:
		has anyone with this card gotten it to work under linux
		2.4.4-acX? if so, how?
	I have read about many people upgrading firmware and using
	'latest drivers' both of which i have done, so i am at a loss
	here. any help is appreciated. --gabe
