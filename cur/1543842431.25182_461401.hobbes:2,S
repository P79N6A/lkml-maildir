Subject: [PATCH 0/2] ieee1394: sbp2: switch flavor of MODE SENSE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It became apparent lately that MODE SENSE (6) is more palatable to some
SBP-2 devices and is more popular among other OSs than MODE SENSE (10).
The RBC spec disagrees with sbp2 too.
 - ieee1394: sbp2: don't prefer MODE SENSE 10
   (supercedes recent workaround for write protect bit of Initio firmware)
 - ieee1394: sbp2: enable auto spin-up for all SBP-2 devices
   (old patch, reposted in refreshed form to be reapplied smoothly without
   the Initio workaround underneath)
