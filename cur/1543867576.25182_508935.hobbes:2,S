I'm not saying remove user spaces' ability to set the
denial-of-service limits.  I'm saying if they need to be frequently
changed we need to update the default so they are higher by default.
There really is no cost in moving those values up and down  it is just
an arbitrary integer used in comparisons.  But if we can make a good
guess that still catches runaway programs before they kill the machine
but also allows more programs to work out of the box we are in better
shape.
