I don't think so - if I dd out of ROM, I get something that looks like a
video BIOS (and, indeed, I can make VBE calls to and from it). The
problem is jumping to c000:0003 and executing - this has the effect of
turning off the backlight and giving an illegal instruction error
(I /think/ - I may be getting the machine I have here confused with one
a tester has...)
