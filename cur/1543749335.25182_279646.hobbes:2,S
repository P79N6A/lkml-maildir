I agree that anything like /.* is broken and strange... But this is only 
my little opinion. :-)
But why creating dir in /proc - like /proc/debug is bad? Its advantages:
- it does not pollute namespace,
- it can be created by kernel at startup even on systems where debugfs 
will not be used (why not?),
- /proc is mounted in all configurations and often it is the first thing 
that startscripts do,
- if somebody really needs to debug proc using debugfs he can always mount 
it as /debug temporaily.
Thanks,
