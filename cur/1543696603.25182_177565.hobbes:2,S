They're the same. Both boxes use Debian Sid with gcc-3.3.2. I made sure 
they were both running the same versions of gcc/binutils when I tested it. 
When I use gcc-2.95.4 (gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 Debian prerelease) on 
the "broken" machine I get a crash at the same point, but with different 
output. (not captured, due to got annoyed and gave up) I can probably spend 
an hour or so recompiling and capturing said crash if you want me to.
As for software versions (kahlua is "bad", shiraz is "good")

As you see, versions are identical on both machines - this is what had me 
baffled. Every single other thing works fine on the "bad" machine, so I 
tend to not suspect a hardware problem.
