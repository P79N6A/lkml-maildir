Which screen saver is this?
jwz's xscreensaver 4.13 mostly works for me with XFree86 4.3.0, and notices
keyboard activity and mouse cursor movement, but fails to detect mouse button
events - so if you're in a mail program and reading a lot of mail and hitting 'delete'
over and over, the screensaver can kick in anyhow.
I have to admit I've not tracked down if this is xscreensaver's fault, or the
X server's fault, or the kernel's fault.
