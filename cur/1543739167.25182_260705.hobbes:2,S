I can recreate it without NAPI and without the preemptable kernel, but
I have no means of recreating this with out Reiser4.  Would an oops
without the NAPI and preemptable kernel be more useful than the one I
already provided?  If so I can make another oops.
I spoke with Nikita shortly on OFTC and he said the oops "is not
related to reiser4, at least not directly. Maybe reiser4 corrupted
some internal data-structures some where in the kernel which caused
oops later."
Shrug.
