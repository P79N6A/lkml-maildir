Well the problem is not really in the ACPI code, but rather in the PCI 
code that tries to inconditionnaly enable SMBus and thus PCI devices 
without _also_ honoring the firmware configured IO port regions for the 
devices it just enabled. Thus, when ACPI use the DTST to also map the 
same IO ports regions  that obviously assume the default firmware value, 
ACPI fails.
Current victimcs are :
	- Asus L3C, L5C users,
	- Probably any user of pci quirk.c code that enables the SMbus...
On the L3C at least, the code to enable the SMBus works perfectly, the 
firmware configured value for the IO region is coherent with what the 
DTST contains but the PCI code change PCI configuration space default 
value and thus breaks ACPI...
