I looked at all the architectures and found that the disparity of the
type of the "lock" field in struct rwlock_t is even larger than I had
indicated in my earlier email.  I am attaching a proof of concept patch
to handle this.  If this looks like a good method to you then I will
create a real patch against your current patch, and include i386,
mips, x86_64, and ppc.

For the curious, the implementations of the "lock" field are listed
below:
rwlock_t lock implemented as a spinlock field and a counter field
    include/asm-parisc/spinlock.h
    include/asm-sh/spinlock.h
rwlock_t lock implemented as a 31 bit counter field and a 1 bit write lock field
    include/asm-ia64/spinlock.h
rwlock_t lock implemented as a 1 bit write lock field and a 31 bit counter field
    include/asm-alpha/spinlock.h
rwlock_t lock implemented as an unsigned int field
    include/asm-arm/spinlock.h
    include/asm-i386/spinlock.h
    include/asm-mips/spinlock.h
    include/asm-x86_64/spinlock.h
    include/asm-sparc/spinlock.h
    include/asm-sparc64/spinlock.h #ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
rwlock_t lock implemented as a signed int field
    include/asm-m32r/spinlock.h
    include/asm-ppc64/spinlock.h
    include/asm-ppc/spinlock.h
rwlock_t lock implemented as an unsigned long field
    include/asm-s390/spinlock.h
rwlock_t lock implemented as an unsigned int (_not_ in a structure)
    include/asm-sparc64/spinlock.h #ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
SMP rwlock_t not supported (no SMP support)
    include/asm-arm26/spinlock.h
    include/asm-frv/spinlock.h
