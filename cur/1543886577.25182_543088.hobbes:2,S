Thanks, I noticed the same thing on an nx6325.
The goal at the moment is to revert to the simplest functional & stable solution --
as what is shipping today crashes on some boxes.
We've got a couple of tweaks in mind where we think Linux can get
smarter -- but this is an area where several platform vendors are taking
advantage of Windows' implementation in (different) twisted ways.
For us to reach our goal of Linux handling any system out there
in as optimal a way as possible, we need to study each one in detail.
That said, can you send me or point me to the acpidump output
for your EVO.  Yes, I'm sure you've sent it before a long time
ago, but that was about probably 2,000,000 e-mail messages
and a couple of disk crashes ago:-)
thanks,
