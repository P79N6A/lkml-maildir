In my case at least, we're talking about archival storage.  Plan9 uses a 
"write buffer" of 1-2GB or so, to mitigate performance loss, which seems 
reasonable.  With archival storage and hash indexes and such, you're 
certainly going to be dirtying more disk blocks than a traditional local 
filesystem would.
