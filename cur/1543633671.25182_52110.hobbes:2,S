I was mostly joking about the fact that no one else on the list seemed 
to run into the error.  I think you did more than your part when you 
released IDE 87... I posted to the list as a way of "cancelling" the bug 
report.
I apologize for the ill-planned joke... <TOTAL JOKE>I realize that 
touchy bitch syndrome seems to be running rampant on LKML this 
season</TOTAL JOKE>.
