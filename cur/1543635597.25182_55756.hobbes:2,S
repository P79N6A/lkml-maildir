For filesystems the only currently existing race is in the case when
init_module() registers one, then decides to bail out and unregisters it.
If somebody finds the thing between register/unregister the current code
is screwed.  And no, "don't block in between" is not viable - typically
the reason of failure is failing allocation and/or timeouts on some sort
of probing.
As for determining the loading/normal/unloading - we _already_ have that
state, no need to introduce new fields.  How do you think try_inc_mod_count()
manages to work?  Exactly - there's a field of struct module that contains
a bunch of flags.  And no, Daniel's ramblings (from what I've seen quoted)
are pure BS - there's no need to mess with "oh, but I refuse to be
unregistered"; proper refcounting is easy for normal cases.

It's not needed.  I don't see where this ret-rmmod crap is coming from -
module uses some interface and decisions about holding it pinned belong
to that interface.  Plain, simple and works for all normal drivers.
/me ponders removing Daniel from killfile and decides that it's not worth
the trouble...
