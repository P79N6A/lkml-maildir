Why this hurry? What is so badly broken, that it must be fixed before 2.6?

It's not a new requirement, before it had to use try_inc_mod_count() for
this.

Where is the problem? You can use your bigref like you already
demonstrated and proc_net_destroy() also does a call to proc_net_unlink().

I don't get this, sorry.

It can be done gradually? The interfaces can be changed step by step.
Interfaces which already use try_inc_mod_count() can be converted
trivially as demonstrated by my patch.

So your argument is to move everything into the kernel to make the
initramdisk simpler?

Rusty, have you understood, what my new module layout is all about? So far
I haven't heard a single argument for or against it. I haven't explained
it yet in detail, but I didn't got any questions about it either.
If you understood it, it will be certainly no problem for you to show me,
where my claim is flawed.

If we continue to build on bad interfaces, it will certainly cost us a
lot.

What does this prove?
You're trying to get a monster patch into the kernel, which is mostly only
tested by you and breaks most architectures without good (urgent) reason.
Sorry, that I can't really feel comfortable with this.
