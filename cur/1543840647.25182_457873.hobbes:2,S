Using 2.6.17.11 with reiser4 patch only. Voluntary preempt.
Recently, I have been receiving this sequence of errors:
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hdb: DMA disabled
Previously, with a different hdb drive, the above hda/b were reversed, but
the output the same.
Diagnostics on the drives are fine. Removing the b drive removes the
messages. System functions fine anyway, and no data is lost as a result
of the errors. The persistence of it is frustrating!
With so many moving parts in a kernel, applications, drivers, and a user's
system, it's hard to pin down the root of the problem. I have a mix of
filesystems, drivers, etc. While I cannot recall exactly when I started
noticing these problems, I would venture it was in the 2.6.16 series. I
have two thoughts about these errors.
1) In my case, hda and hdb are different in capabilities.

could it be that the dma or io handler is having trouble when each device
has different capabilities on the same ide channel? Or, could it be that
reiserfs or reiser4 is turning off dma because it is timing out somehow?
2) VMWare. I have noticed recently that the errors are occurring during or
after VMWare is run.
from dmesg:
/dev/vmnet: open called by PID 9443 (vmware-vmx)
eth0: Promiscuous mode enabled.
device eth0 entered promiscuous mode
bridge-eth0: enabled promiscuous mode
/dev/vmnet: port on hub 0 successfully opened
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
I have tried compiling with all three preemption models, including with
the ck, beyond, and other variant patchsets. Currently, I am testing with
NO preemption and the errors are fewer but still there.
MOBO bios has dma enabled including for UDMA and prefetch is set to on.
Again, it's interesting to note I did not observe this error with only one
drive on ide0. I cannot pin down any more details at the moment, but if
anyone wants to explore this further (I know this has been an issue for
years), I am happy to try and help.
