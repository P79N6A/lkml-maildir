Hi Huang,
This patchset should be rebased on top of Rusty's changes; the rebase is 
  fairly trivial and I was originally intending to simply commit the 
rebase as-is, with the boot protocol version bumped to 2.08.
However, the documentation section is simply wrong in a number of 
places.  In particular:
+In 32-bit boot protocol, the first step in loading a Linux kernel
+should still be to load the real-mode code and then examine the kernel
+header at offset 0x01f1. But, it is not necessary to load all
+real-mode code, just first 4K bytes traditionally known as "zero page"
+is needed.
This is incorrect.  The zeropage (which really is better referred to as 
struct boot_param) should be initialized to all zero, except for the 
setup header (starting at offset 0x1f0 or 0x1f1(*)) to the length 
specified either by boot protocol version or by the byte at offset 0x201.
+At entry, the CPU must be in 32-bit protected mode with paging
+disabled; the CS and DS must be 4G flat segments; %esi holds the base
+address of the "zero page"; %esp, %ebp, %edi should be zero.
You also need to have a GDT loaded with the selectors for __BOOT_CS 
(0x10) and __BOOT_DS (0x18) containing appropriate values, and you 
should enter with interrupts disabled.  For safety, set up ES and SS as 
well as DS.
The bit about %esp, %ebp and %edi being zero is nonsense, although 
specifying at least %ebp == %edi == 0 for future use isn't a bad idea. 
On the other hand, %ebx *is* supposed to be zero.
The documentation in zero-page.txt is wrong when it comes to protocol 
versions.  Most of these fields are ancient, and only a handful of the 
remainder can be tied to specific protocol versions.
+  struct setup_data {
+	  u64 next;
+	  u32 type;
+	  u32 len;
+	  u8  data[0];
+  } __attribute__((packed));
Why packed?
Time permitting, I might rewrite this myself, but it may be quicker for 
you to update it.
