I don't think it's behaviour many apps rely on.  But this is exactly the
kind of behaviour which can break security models.

Well, xinted won't really read from multiple processes simultaneously
(if all is working properly).  The xinetd server will see the initial
packet, then fork/exec and close off all extra fds.  Now, try and write
a firewall ruleset that mandatorily enforces that.  See the trouble?

Heh, right.  The sock is protocol specific.  The input happening on ip
level is before sock lookup.
