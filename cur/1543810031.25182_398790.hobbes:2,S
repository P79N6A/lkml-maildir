I got an advisory about w83627hf in my logs, but not from the rc4 
reboot.  The previous ones were:
Feb 13 00:31:18 coyote kernel: Driver 'w83627hf' needs updating - please 
use bus_type methods
Feb 13 00:36:20 coyote kernel: Driver 'w83627hf' needs updating - please 
use bus_type methods
Two quick reboots there, the first one would have been rc2, I forgot to 
update grub.conf :(
which would have been booted to rc2 and 3, not rc4. I believe they 
started at rc1 but I won't swear to that.  gkrellm and sensors are both 
working albeit sensors is saying C for the diode in the cpu when it 
should be F
gkrellm-2.28 is displaying it correctly though.
So apparently something has been updated with rc4?
