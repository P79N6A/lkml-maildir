Sorry about that. I've had problems in the past with my email client 
word wrapping patches, so to be sure the patch goes untouched I sent it 
this way.
Since I've changed email client since then, next time I'll try inlining 
again.

Yes, you are correct.
Right now I'm working on making the proc interface more eficient by 
removing all the seq_file stuff, that was needed because of the O(n) 
lookup time we had previously.
Not using seq_file with stem decompression would make a simple "cat 
/proc/kallsyms" to be O(n^2).
Bets regards,
