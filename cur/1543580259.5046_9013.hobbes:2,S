After compiling 2.4 and 2.4ac11 I got failed boots as well, getting 
either 
  LI
or 
  LIL
And then nothing.  This is a K6-2 450 machine, all previous (2.4.0-test*) 
kernels worked fine.  The correct processor is selected...
# CONFIG_MPENTIUMIII is not set
# CONFIG_MPENTIUM4 is not set
CONFIG_MK6=y
# CONFIG_MK7 is not set
Running an up to date debian woody distribution.
Switching back to the 2.4.0-test10 kernel and boot sector (using
debian's kernel package) made everything happy again.   Let me know
if a newbie can do anything to help.
