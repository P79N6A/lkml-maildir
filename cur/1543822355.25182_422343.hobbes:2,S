Argh, sorry for confusion, I've checked several first in the list and wrongly
concluded nothing is used. Anyway, please, remove unused HPT_IOCTL_ defines.

#ifdef is totally unneeded.
Module init and exit functions should be marked with __init and __exit
resp.
Use DMA_??BIT_MASK in calls to pci_set_dma_mask(). See
include/linux/dma-mapping.h for readily available items.
hptiop_get_logical_devices can return -1 and you'll end up with
	for (j = 0; j < -1; j++)
in hptiop_show_devicelist()
u64 things are printed as
	"%llu", (unsigned long long)capacity
Is unsigned long long enough in this case?
I also suggest to use vsnprintf() in hptiop_copy_info() because you use
it with strings.
Funny, that you do
	driveid->model[20] = 0;
when ->model is in fact 40 chars long.
