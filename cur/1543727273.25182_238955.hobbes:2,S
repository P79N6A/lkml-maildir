Isn't the "unique VGA" a disappearing problem?
I have the impression that many new (PCI/AGP) video cards
can work fine without the legacy VGA stuff - therefore, no conflict
when using several cards simultaneously.
Please avoid unnecessary disabling of such devices, that only causes
trouble for those of use trying to use several screens at once. (Possibly
with several simultaneous _users_, who don't want their screen disabled 
for no
good reason.) Of course one may have to buy the "right" cards when 
setting up
such a machine.
