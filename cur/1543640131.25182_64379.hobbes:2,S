i guess i'm just being difficult, but process (thread) Y and thread Z
share the same VM, right? So it's a threaded application, and as such i'd
expect it to free its state when exiting. Ie. it must write to memory in
Z. Now since the ->user_tid address is in thread Y's thread control block
(or any similar thread state descriptor), i cannot see any problem why
zeroing this TID value would be incorrect.

i think i see where the misunderstanding comes from: thread Y does not
want to get into the address space of X - this is how the current
CLEAR_TID code works and is expected to work. Threads always free their
*own* thread state descriptor upon exit (eg. they set a flag in their own
thread descriptor), not some field in the parent's domain. So thread Y
does not ever want to write into X's address space - it wants to write
into the VM that it's part of currently - if a fork() created a new VM
then so be it, it's not attached to X in any way.
