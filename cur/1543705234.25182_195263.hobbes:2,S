Yes, it is a zombie when the waitpid is executed.

It is quite easily visible - in fact, it's hilarious.

What that means I'm not entirely sure.

At this point it is being traced - this is gdbserver.  But the same
process that is tracing it is calling waitpid.  And the problem
persists after the tracer dies; the process above is actually from a
couple of hours ago, and its tracer was killed.

The only two kernels I've tried were 2.6.0-test7 and 2.6.2-rc3, by the
way - same behavior in both.  I'll try to write a single program
testcase for this.
