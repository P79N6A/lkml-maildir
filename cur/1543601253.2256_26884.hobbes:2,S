Thinking again about it, I guess I would prefer a FIFO-list of allocated pages.
This would allow to "know" the age simply by its position in the list. You
wouldn't need a timestamp then, and even better it works equally well for
systems with high vm load and low, because you do not deal with absolute time
comparisons, but relative.
That sounds pretty good for me. 
Still the problem with page accesses is not solved, but if you had an idea on
that, you could manipulate the alloc-list simply by moving accessed pages to
the end (one or several positions) of the list which effectively "youngers"
them. So you came around any new members of some structs with simple (and fast)
list operations.
Comments?
