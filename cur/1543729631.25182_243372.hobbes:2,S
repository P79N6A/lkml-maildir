As far as I can tell SuSE has had the following text in the cdrecord
banner for a while:
Cdrecord-Clone-dvd 2.01a27 (i686-suse-linux) Copyright (C) 1995-2004 Jörg Schilling
Note: This version is an unofficial (modified) version with DVD support
Note: and therefore may have bugs that are not present in the original.
Note: Please send bug reports or support requests to 
http://www.suse.de/feedback
Note: The author of cdrecord should not be bothered with problems in this version.
So I wonder what Jörg is complaining about.
