I thought it was for udev to create the device nodes? But
I might be wrong on that.
If it's ok to ignore such failures there sometimes then the warning
attribute should
be dropped. But just shutting the warning up is the wrong change.
Beides if floppy doesn't need sysfs for anything why does it
initialize sysfs? IMHO sysfs should be only used if there is a
good reason, otherwise it is just wasted memory.
