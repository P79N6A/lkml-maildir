Given where we are in the release cycle, I think this "cleanup" patch
should be reverted.  Once the issues with it are resolved (why was it
never even CC'd to the arch maintainers for review?) then it can go
into mainline.
Note that it also looks like (from the commitdiff) that the above
mentioned commit also removes:
CONFIG_HARDWARE_PM (blackfin)
CONFIG_OPROFILE_CELL (powerpc)
So they're probably subtly broken as well.
Linus, what do you think?  Should 09cadedbdc01f1a4bea1f427d4fb4642eaa19da9
be reverted?
