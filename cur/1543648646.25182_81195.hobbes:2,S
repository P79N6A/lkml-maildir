   Thus this indicates the problem is in the Tigon3 driver.
Please retest with 2.4.19.
There have actually been a lot of Athlon based problem reports in the
2.4.20 series.  And to be honest, tigon3 hardware is buggy in spots.
You could also download and try Broadcom's driver with your card in
2.4.20-pre10-ac2 if you'd like to rule out tg3.c specifically.
