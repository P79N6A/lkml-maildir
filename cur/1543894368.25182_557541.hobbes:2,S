Turnabout is fair play, and unilateral disarmament is a bad strategy in a 
mexican standoff?
Finding it morally justified to _have_ powers is not the same as finding it 
morally justified to _use_ powers you have anyway.  Lots of companies (like 
Red Hat) amass defensive software patent portfolios because the patent system 
is so screwed up.
But then, I'm a pragmatist, not an idealist.  You can be one or the other and 
make it work.  Mixing the two tends to suck.  Being ruthlessly pragmatic in 
the pursuit of an ideal (as the FSF seems to be doing) has often been a 
recipe for disaster...
