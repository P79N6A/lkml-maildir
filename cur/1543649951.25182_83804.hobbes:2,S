Alan said that 32 bit dev_t was one of the most important remaining new 
features, but I haven't seen a patch submitted for inclusion.  Closest 
anybody's been able to dredge up is an old plan from Al Viro, which lwn.net 
linked to here:

Is this a 2.5.45 thing?  Could it possibly go in after the feature freeze 
(I.E. without any API changes)?  Is it now deferred until the next 
development cycle?  Is there, in point of fact, a patch against 2.5.44?
