This is because MAKEDEV attempts to parse /proc/devices, and store the
results in shell variables.
If you look, /proc/devices has the following lines in it:
	2 pty/m%d
	3 pty/s%d
	4 tts/%d
	5 cua/%d
The "%d" look a bit suspect, but I guess it is meaningful to devfs
(it was changed in 2.3.46 when devfs was included).
If it is intended that lines in /proc/devices contain a '/', then MAKEDEV
will need an overhaul to deal with it.
