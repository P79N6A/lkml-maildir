If many copyright holders don't agree then clearly firmware blobs
shouldn't go into the kernel. It is difficult to argue that just one is
enough for a veto, especially since at least one driver (Advansys) has
been there, complete with its "bucket of bits" since 1.3.x days at 
least. Any contributor to the kernel since then who cared could have 
been aware of that as evidence of a de-facto interpretation of the GPL
source clause as not applying to firmware in Linux.

The technical advantages you give are not compelling for the Atmel 
driver. The driver has international roaming support built-in and the
firmware size is than 20k. In general though they may be good points.
I suggest that having a driver which "just works" without needing
extra files and configuration steps would trump minmizing legal
exposure to the Linux copyright holders, for most people in the real
world.
Cheers
Simon.
