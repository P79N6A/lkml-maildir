Ug. I'm thin on time this week, so I was hoping to save this discussion
for later, but I guess we can get into it now.
Well, assuming timer interrupts actually occur HZ times a second, yes
one could (and current practice, one does) implicitly interpret jiffies
as being a valid notion of time.  However with SMIs, bad drivers that
disable interrupts for too long, and virtualization the reality is that
that assumption doesn't hold. 
We do have the lost-ticks compensation code that tries to help this, but
that conflicts with some virtualization implementations. Suspend/resume
tries to compensate jiffies for ticks missed over time suspended, but
I'm not sure how accurate it really is (additionally, looking at it now,
it assumes jiffies is only 32bits).
Adding to that, the whole jiffies doesn't really increment at HZ, but
ACTHZ confusion, or bad drivers that assume HZ=100, we get a fair amount
of trouble stemming from folks using jiffies as a time value.  Because
in reality, it is just a interrupt counter.
So now, if new timeofday code emulates jiffies, we have to decide if it
emulates jiffies at HZ or ACTHZ? Also there could be issues with jiffies
possibly jittering from it being incremented every tick and then set to
the proper time when the timekeeping code runs. 
I'm not sure which is the best way to go, but it sounds that emulating
it is probably the easiest. I just deferred the question with a comment
until now because its not completely obvious. Any suggestions on the
above questions (I'm guessing the answers are: use ACTHZ, and the jitter
won't hurt that bad).

Well, something Nish Aravamudan has been working on is converting the
common users of jiffies (drivers) to start using human time units. These
very well understood units (which avoid HZ/ACTHZ/HZ=100 assumptions) can
then be accurately changed to jiffies (or possibly some other time unit)
internally. It would even be possible for soft-timers to expire based
upon the actual high-res time value, rather then the low-res tick-
counter(which is something else Nish has been playing with). When that
occurs we can easily start doing other interesting things that I believe
you've already been working on in your HRT code, such as changing the
timer interrupt frequency dynamically, or working with multiple timer
interrupt sources. 
So basically, lots of interesting questions and possibilities and I very
much look forward to your input and suggestions. 
thanks
