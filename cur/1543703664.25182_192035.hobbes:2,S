Subject: TG3: very high CPU usage

Greetings all,
Has the TG3 driver been well tested with the AC9100 and compatible gigabit NIC chipsets?
iperf, between a 2.6.0 box and a WinXP box (both running Netgear GA302Ts with the AC9100), shows max throughput of 35MB/sec.
However, when using Apache or any FTP client/daemon, the TG3 driver appears to be VERY slow maxing out CPU usage at 100% while only transfering at around 12MB/sec.
This applies for both incoming or outgoing data.
2.6.1 behaves worse, using 100% CPU usage to maintain approx 9MB/sec rates.
Ive tried other NICs, etc and confirmed that it is a problem with the TG3 driver.
Is this a known problem?
Thanks,
 Mark Williams.
