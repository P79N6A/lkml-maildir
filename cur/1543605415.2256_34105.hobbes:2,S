I just wanted to code a solution that is compatible with all architectures
and that has the lower cost in terms of i-d/cache.
That's why i used jiffies instead of get_cycles() and time instead of perf
counters.
The bottom line is that having to choose between a process that is run for
10 ms and one that is run for 150 ms, by choosing the 150 one we have a
very good probability to pick up the one that has a greater footprint.
Coding more complex solutions will have the effect to add an extra cost
that will _probably_ vanish the better behavior given by the patch.
