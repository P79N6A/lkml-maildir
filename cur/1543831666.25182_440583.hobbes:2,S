Hm.. indeed it is. But this is quite strange. This means, that if some
device queues are congested, pdflush threads will be stuck waiting for
these queues to drain, and as there is only limited number of pdflush
threads in the system, write-out to the non-congested devices will not
progress too.
Doing large amounts of writeback from pdflush threads makes situation
only worse: suppose you have more than MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS devices on
the system, and large number of writing threads. If some devices become
congested, then *all* pdflush threads may easily stuck waiting on queue
congestion and there will be no IO going on against other devices. This
would be especially bad, if system is a mix of slow and fast devices.
In the original code, threads writing into fast devices are not impacted
by congestion of slow devices.
You can deal with that particular situation in your patch by checking
return value of
        pdflush_operation(background_writeout, 0);
and falling back to synchronous write-back if it fails to find worker
thread.

Yes, that was silly proposal. I think your patch contains very useful
idea, but it cannot be applied to all file systems. Maybe
wait-for-pdflush can be made optional, depending on the file system
type?
