I did some threaded programming on OS/2 and it was real pain. The main
design flaw in OS/2 API is that thread can be blocked only on one
condition. There is no way thread can wait for more events. For example I
have a thread that processes GUI messages. It is blocked in WinGetMsg -
waiting for messages from pmshell. Now another part of application needs
to wake up the thread to do some things - but there is no way to wake it
up because the thread can't wait for anything else than messages from
pmshell. I actually had to create dummy invisible window. I send messages
to that GUI thread via event queue of that window - really dirty but it
can't be done otherwise. 
When OS/2 designers realised this API braindamage, they somewhere randomly
added funtions to unblock threads waiting for variuos events - for example
VioModeUndo or VioSavRedrawUndo - quite insane.
Programming with select, poll and kqueue on Unix is really much better
than with threads on OS/2.
