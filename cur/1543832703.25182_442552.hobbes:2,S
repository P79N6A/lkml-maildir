Yes, I understand what the code is doing, but *why* do 
things this way?  (To put things another way: why not *always 
have splice() update the file offset?)  I realise there may be
some good reason for this, and if there is, it will go into the
man page!

No!  It does not!  See the sendfile.2 man page: "sendfile() 
does not modify the current file offset of in_fd."  
(You had me worried -- I just now went and *tested* 
the operation of sendfile().)  The app does not need to 
do an lseek() call because the 'offset' argument is *always* 
updated with the new "virtual" offset.  This is part of why I 
am disturbed/confused: sendfile() always updates its 'offset' 
argument and *never* changes the file offset; splice() only 
does that if its 'offset' argument is non-NULL.
Cheers,
Michael
