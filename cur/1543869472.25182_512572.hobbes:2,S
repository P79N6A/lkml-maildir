the on/off calls are shaped in a way that makes them ultimately 
vsyscall-able - the kernel only needs to know about the fact that we are 
in a threadlet (so that the scheduler can do its special 
push-head-to-another-context thing) - and this can be signalled via a 
small user-space-side info structure as well, put into the TLS.

yeah - and that's how it works in my current codebase already, 
threadlet_off() takes a 'completion event' pointer as well, and the ahu. 
I'll release v4 so that you can have a look.
