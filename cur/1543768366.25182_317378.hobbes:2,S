Anything that can be done at the fs level should be doable on the vfs level too.
That is simple to show in theory: You could make the VFS api identical to
the reiser4 api, and reiser4 should continue to work as efficiently as before.

I cannot see why reiser4 should suffer - but of course this might be hard to
implement for other filesystems.
