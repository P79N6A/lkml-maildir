I was referring to your code you posted for merging on linux-dvb,
and which got rejected. Anyway, it's easy to agree with you if one
has just heard _your_ version -- the purpose of this thread is to
give people an alternate version of the story to complement
yours, which would allow the people you talked to to think it over
and change their mind. See if you can get of those people you
talked to to post here to support you.

IOW you say if I don't write code I should shut up?
Is that also what you tell users on your em28xx list
when they dare to disagree with you?
Nice...
