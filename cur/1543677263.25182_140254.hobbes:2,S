I'm heading out there today to take a look at the machine and see what
happened.  I'm rather dissappointed in the 3ware utility, it alternately
claims both drives are ok(./tw_cli info c1 is different from ./tw_cli
info c1 u0)
I was relying on that too much, and ignored the possiblity of two drive
failure.  Looks like both drives would have failed at exactly the same
time, which sounds like a power spike.
I just got a report that another Windows98 workstation is randomly
rebooting after an hour of uptime at the same facility, so I'm suspecting
hardware failure like you did.
I'll see what's up when I get there.  Powermax will tell me what's up.
Luckily the damage is contained to the data drive, I will be able to copy
everything over to a new set of drives and not lose anything that's not
trivially replaceable.
Thank you Alan,
Mike
