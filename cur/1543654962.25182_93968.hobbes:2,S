Recursive dependencies are not allowed, the parser currently accepts them 
silently, but that will change.
Anyway, I don't really understand above, SOFTWARE_SUSPEND can only be 
selected if ACPI_SLEEP sleep is selected, so why should it select 
ACPI_SLEEP? 
Could you please make a table of all possible combinations?
