Looks good to me, although I suppose it wouldn't hurt to include
<linux/list.h> as well since there seems to be an ongoing effort to
reduce the number of files that are included implicitly through other
headers. Might save us from some trouble later.
I've closed your support request, so you shouldn't expect a reply from
avr32@atmel.com (I was going to reply through the support system, but
I couldn't figure out how to prevent it from top-quoting.) Probably
best if you send patches directly to me at hskinnemoen@atmel.com, but
the support address is a nice fallback if I'm unable to respond for
some reason.
