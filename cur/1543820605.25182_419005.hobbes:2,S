Admitted, I'm a bit slow at times.  But why does this matter?
According to my fairly limited brain, you take a potentially expensive
barrier, so you pay with a bit of runtime.  What you buy is a smaller
critical section, so you can save some runtime on other cpus.  When
optimizing for the common case, which is one cpu, this is a net loss.
There must be some correctness issue hidden that I cannot see.  Can
you explain that to me?
