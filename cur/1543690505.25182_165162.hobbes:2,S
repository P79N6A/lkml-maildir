Firstly performance, secondly user space exceptions. We work around lots
of other broken CPU things this one triggers a path that only matters on
Athlon.
There is *one* change needed. We shouldnt call is_prefetch unless the
current CPU is an Athlon. That way its a performance improvement for
PIV, and Athlon in general, fixes the bug and causes no fancy athlon
fixup code for non AMD processors.
