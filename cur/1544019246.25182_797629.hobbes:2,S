Actually, PPC64 boxes basically don't care... the usable GPRs are all
either 32-bit (for PPC32) or 64-bit (for PPC64), the <=32-bit
instructions are identical across both, they just
truncate/sign-extend/etc based on the lower 32-bits of the register.
Also, you would only do a right-shift if you were going all the way
out to memory as 64-bit and all the way back in as 32-bit... within a
single register it's kept coherent.
Structs are basically irrelevant for inline ASM as you can't pass a
struct to one... you can only pass the *address* of a struct, which is
always pointer-sized.
I think that really the only sane solution (which is hopefully what
GCC does) for integer types is to use a register the same size as the
larger of the two integers.  Then you copy the value to/from the
smaller register (or just mask it on PPC64-alike architectures) before
or after the inline ASM.
