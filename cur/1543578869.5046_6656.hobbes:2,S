As you know, a disk does not have a geometry, but
the location of a partition is described in linear
and 3D coordinates, and translating between the two
requires a geometry. Commands like
	% sfdisk -d /dev/hdf > hdf.pt
	% sfdisk /dev/hdf < hdf.pt
suffice to make the translation uniform for the
kernel's current idea of sectors, heads.
If you don't like that idea, then -C,-H,-S options
serve to tell sfdisk about the desired geometry.
See sfdisk(8).
[Save a copy of the old situation, and make the geometry so
that Windows likes it. Linux is happy with every geometry.]
