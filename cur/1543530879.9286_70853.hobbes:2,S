When have you seen a Linux box crash simply because all the
application memory was in use? I have never seen this, and it
certainly shouldn't happen...
What is really happening is that a BUG in the kernel is
rebooting/crashing the system under particular circumstances. Fix that
bug, not the circumstances under which it shows up.
Disabling overcommit does NOT prevent the system running out of
memory. It exacerbates it.
