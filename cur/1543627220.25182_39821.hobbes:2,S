Hi all,
Is there any reason why my Linux NFS client (kernel 2.4.18
nfs-utils-0.3.1-13.7.2.1 from RedHat 7.2) is not able to mount a directory
exported from an IRIX server in NFSv3 (not sure which version of IRIX
yet, if this is important I will find out). NFSv2 works fine, but if I
try to force NFSv3 I get "Connection refused".
I'll appreciate any help.
Regards,
