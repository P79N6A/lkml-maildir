I don't see why user code needs to determine NR_CPUS exactly.  Any
reasonable upper bound should work - reasonable meaning doesn't waste
too many unused words of memory.
It's not really NR_CPUS that users need - its a reasonably close upper
bound to the size of the space that sched_getaffinity() must be provided
they need.  And your code does a pretty good job of providing that.
