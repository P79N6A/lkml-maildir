   Most likely due to lack of knowledge about parport from the author's
   side ... well thats my guess at least. Doing it for other reasons is
   broken.
No, a lot of the Rio utilities are meant to be portable, and the
parport driver only exists in Linux, and will require additional
kernel code to boot (as I understand it).  I'll be using it for riofs,
but not until I figure it out.
