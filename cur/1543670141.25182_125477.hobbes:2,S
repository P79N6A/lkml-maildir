I'm currently working on support for the USB gadget controller inside
the Intel PXA25x XScale processor. David Brownell has recently published
a new USB gadget API which was discussed on linux-usb-devel and which
seems to be a good starting point.
As there is at least one other API (by Belcarra, former Lineo code) I'm
wondering what Greg's and Linus' position concerning the new USB gadget
API is. A comment from your side would be welcome. 
Cheers,
Robert
