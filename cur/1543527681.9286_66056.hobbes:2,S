ah, sorry. I see, it comes from arch/i386/fault.c
so what happened was that, for example, emacs requested extra mem,
it could not get it and it got killed ?!?!? .. it is not behavior I used
to know from 1.2.x kernels.
I'm perplexed. 
Still, I don't like any for out of OOM killings, and it reminds me of AIX
and Windows. If that's posssible, ideally I would like to have some proc
interace to be able to diable oomk at boot time.
I used to have a latop.  It was either late 1.2.x kernel or early 2.2.x
kernel. Since it has only 16 mb of ram, it used to run out of memeory
every thing. However, I used to use it heavily every day and it had uptime
of over 200 days (only so much b/c its bateries did not have enough juice
to survie trans-atlantic flight).. and I never had any problems due to oom
conditions.. at least problems which would bother me, like killing my
emacs.
