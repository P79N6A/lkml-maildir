There are other reasons why stores can be eliminated, and "memory" does
not prevent those.
Example: you have two stores to the same address.  An "asm" with
"memory" is in between the stores.
The first store can still be dropped, even though we don't know _which_
memory the "memory" clobbers.
Now, "memory" may well mean "this asm is considered to read some memory
and clobber some memory".  But that's not what the manual says, and it
would be inconsistent with other kinds of clobber.

If you are thinking of my examples, "memory" doesn't clobber local
variables.  It does affect the scheduling of reads from general memory
into a local variable.
