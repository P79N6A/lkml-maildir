You still complaining about not stashing the full path name of the
module somewhere in the kernel?
That would be because that was a HACK, and it's my job to say "no",
even when that means we're not "feature complete" by someone's
definition.
You seem to have taken the politeness of my previous response as an
indication of uncertainty.  I am sorry if I gave that impression,
allow me to translate it into Torvaldsian:
	Your patch added a specific "profile_module_loaded()" call
	which did nothing but call a notifier.  Just call a damn
	notifier directly, which is more obvious, more flexible, less
	code and more expandable, and doesn't give you a black star
	for being stupid.
Or, in Viroese, "Vetoed".
Hope that helps 8)
Rusty.
