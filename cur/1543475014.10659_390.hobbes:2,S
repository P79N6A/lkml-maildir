	This is problem is probably not related to egcs.  Egcs had problems
with assembly code, but this is only cpp stuff.
	UIO_FASTIOV is defined in <linux/uio.h>, which is included in
read_write.c.
	Maybe your patch is corrupted, and you need to do a clean patch?  I
would be surprised if egcs was so broken that cpp did not work. 
However, no recent patches alter UIO stuff or uio.h, so I don't know
where there problem is.
	Perhaps you forgot to 'make clean'?  Perhaps you forgot to 'make
oldconfig'?
	Hmm... this looks suspicious:
make[2]: Circular /usr/src/linux-2.2.0pre2/include/linux/uio.h <-
/usr/src/linux-2.2.0pre2/include/linux/socket.h dependency dropped.
Hope that helps,
