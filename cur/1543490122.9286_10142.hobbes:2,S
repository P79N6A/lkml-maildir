Coda Distributed File System, version 5.2
Coda is a distributed file system like NFS and AFS. It is freely
available under the GPL. It functions somewhat like AFS in being a
"stateful" file system. Coda and AFS cache files on your local
machine to improve performance. But Coda goes a step further than AFS
by letting you access the cached files when there is no available
network, viz. disconnected laptops and network outages. Coda also has
read write replication servers. The Coda file server is outside the
kernel and on the client theCoda cache manager Venus is again outside
of the kernel, but on clients one needs a kernel module.
To get more information on Coda, check out our WWW site:

If you are using Coda or have had trouble using it, please send us
some feedback at:
http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/feedback.html
There is a wealth of documents, papers, and theses on our WWW
site. There is also a good introduction to the Coda File System in
http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/ljpaper/lj.html
and a Coda-HOWTO:
http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/doc/html/coda-howto.html
Coda was originally developed as an academic prototype/testbed. It is
being polished and rewritten where necessary. Coda is a work in
progress and does have bugs. It is, though, very usable. Our
interest is in making Coda available to as many people as possible and
to have Coda evolve and flourish.
The bulk of the Coda file system code supports the Coda client
program, the Coda server program and the utilities needed by both.
All these programs are unix programs and can run equally well on any
Unix platform. Our main development thrust is improving these
programs. There is a small part of Coda that deals with the kernel to
file system interface. This code is OS specific (but should not be
platform specific).
Coda is currently available for several OS's and platforms:
linux 2.0: i386 & sparc
linux 2.2: i386 & sparc
Freebsd 2.2.x: i386
Freebsd current: i386
NetBSD 1.3x: i386 & sparc
NetBSD current: i386
There are also alpha releases for:
Windows 95 & 98 -- Coda client
Windows NT      -- Coda server
The relevant sources, binaries, and docs can be found in
ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/coda/
There are several mailing lists @coda.cs.cmu.edu that discuss coda:
coda-announce and codalist. We appreciate comments, feedback, bug reports,
bug fixes, enhancements, etc.
Changes:  summary of some of the differences since 5.0.x
    * Updated documentation. 
    * New protection database (simplyfies user administration).
    * Removed obsolete venus-vice rpc2 calls.
    * Server support for trickle fetch and fetch continuations.
    * Improved support on the Windows platforms.
    * Avoid deadlocks in the rpc2 binding sequence.
    * Added support for FreeBSD 4.0 (Robert Watson)
    * Testing for -fno-exceptions in configure script.
    * Switching fetches between volume replicas.
    * Removed the need for -child flag on Win95.
    * Nice GUI frontend on Windows for starting/stopping venus.
      (Michael Callahan and Marc Schnieder)
    * Fixed @sys/@cpu expansions in venus, and allow setuid bits.
    * Added @sys/@cpu commands to cfs to show the `current' expansion.
    * Normal symlinks were sometimes mistaken for inconsistent objects.
    * Fixed a linux-coda kernel problem in lookup
    * Fixed several bugs in the volume package
Please let us know about problems, since we will try to fix them right away.
Compatibility with previous versions:
- network protocol: can coexists with 4.6.7 and later
- disk format client: clients need to be reinitialized
- disk format for server: backward compatible
