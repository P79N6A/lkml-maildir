which "latest"? Linus's 2.6.8-rcX or Andrew's -mm's or Ingo's patches.
I've looked at Ingo patches but didn't see fixes for the followings:
1. In sys_mount(): do_mount() is called with the BKL held. on jffs2
   system, jffs2 might for a big media-scan and lock preemption for
   several msecs. even if jffs2_scan_eraseblock() calls cond_resched()
   for every flash sector, scanning one sector is still very long.
2. netif_receive_skb(): the rcu_read_lock() is too broad. IMHO, it's
   only needed around the 2 list_for_each_entry_rcu()s. There's no
   reason why rcu_read_lock() is needed when calling ip_recv on the
   skb.
3. with Ingo's patches, if all softirqs are done by the daemon then
   there's should be NO need to call local_bh_disable()/enable()
   around the processing loop in ___do_softirq().
4. in cfi_cmdset_0002.c, using spin_lock_bh() to guard struct flchip
   seems to be an overkill. why a semaphore is NOT sufficient?
I'm a total newbie so it's possible that I'm totally wrong about the
aboves.
