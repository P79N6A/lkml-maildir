Andrew,
Following are some fixes to the delay accounting & 
taskstats patches, against 2.6.18-rc2.
The most significant change is the third patch in the
series which turns on delay accounting by default. This 
is a temporary measure to ensure that the features get
coverage testing in 2.6.18-rc kernels without requiring
kernel options to be turned on. Late in the -rc
series, it can be reversed (will send a patch to do that)
