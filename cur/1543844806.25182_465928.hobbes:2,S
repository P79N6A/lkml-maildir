With a bit more contemplation, I think this is one place where (if  
the compiler or sparse are cooperative) we should really look at the  
_Bool type or similar.  If we could cast likely()/unlikely() to  
return (_Bool), then these sorts of problems would be caught at  
compile time, and likewise for other functions which return boolean  
values.
