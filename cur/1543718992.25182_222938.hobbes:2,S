I strongly disagree on the last point.  It may be better, but it may also
be a lot worse.  Too much swap can be a bad thing - see my example in another
post about run-away processes on remote machines.

Again, the user _may_ be better off swapping to a swap partition rather than
having executable code paged out, but this is not necessarily true in all
circumstances.
