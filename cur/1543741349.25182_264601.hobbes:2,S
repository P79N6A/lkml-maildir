I suspect the following (still untested) patch might be
needed, too.  Basically when the VM gets tight, it could
still ignore swappable pages with the referenced bit set.
Both really referenced pages and pages from the process
that currently has the swap token.
Forcefully deactivating a few pages when we run with
priority 0 might get rid of the false OOM kills.
I'm about to test this on a very small system here, and
will let you know how things go.
