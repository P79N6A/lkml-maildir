USB stuff should be discussed on the USB mailing list. Unload uhci_hcd
before suspend and reload it after resume to make sure it does not
interfere.
Check if 3c59x has suspend/resume support. If not, add it.
Panic... we really need to know why it panicked. VESAFB does not
support blanking, just switch to VESAFB and you should be able to see
the messages.
