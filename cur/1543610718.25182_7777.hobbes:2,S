Well, claiming the OS to cause hard errors? Design fault.
Claiming DC loss to cause hard errors? Design fault.
IBM would really better shed some real light on this issue, and if they
spoiled their firmware (heck, there ARE firmware updates for OEM disks
of the 75GXP series) or electronics, they'd better admit that so as to
reinstore the trust people had before DTLA drives were sold.
FUD works its way, so personally, I'm not buying IBM drives until this
issue is FULLY resolved, so I presume, I won't buy any DTLA or and
IC35Lxx drives of the current series. This is not a recommendation, just
what I'm doing.
