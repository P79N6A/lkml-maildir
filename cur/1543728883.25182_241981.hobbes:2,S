Should be fixed now. I'm running a bios raid1 and it seems to be 
doing the right thing. Turns out we had a locking bug on that error
path and the identify block from the raid volumes was wrong
I've added some quirk code to fix up the fields in the identify 
data to indicate LBA28/48 is supported, report that the UDMA data
provided is valid (so we turn DMA on and get cable CRCs).
I've also added code to the it8212 driver to filter the 48bit flush
cache command (seems to kill my card), only queue 128K per I/O (LBA48
full sized I/O's also seem to kill my card) and to skip the 0x27 (native
size) query the firmware doesn't seem to know.
