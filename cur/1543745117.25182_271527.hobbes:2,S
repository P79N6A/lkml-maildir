Sure. Any interrupt saves the return address. It can
be thus inspected. The debugger uses a software interrupt
to do the same thing. The offset of the current instruction
is in EIP for ix86 machines. The problem is that if you
execute code to get that EIP, you end up getting the EIP
of the code that reads the EIP (not too useful). Therefore,
you need to use an interrupt.

Make some code to load code into that buffer.
int (*funct)(void) = buffer;
Initialize a pointer to that buffer, then call it.
Note, code needs to be relocatable. If you don't know
what that means, don't do this at home.
In principle, the code is supposed to be loaded into the
.text segment. You can make a text-segment buffer using
assembly
.section	.text
buffer:		.long	0
.global	buffer
.type	buffer,@function
.org	. + 0x1000
end:
.size	buffer,.-buffer
.end

Just overwrite the code...
funct()
{
}
next()
{
}
main()
{
     len = (funct - next);
     memcpy(funct, new_code, len);
     funct();
}
