Oh well, there is _no_ guarantee that it will be fixed, sometimes there is no
maintainer at all and the ticket will stay there forever lost in the noise...
And if anybody is interested in fixing the driver or even looking to see if
somebody submitted a ticket he/she can just search for all tickets, even the
ones closed because nobody is did any activity in a perior of one month (or any
other timeout period).
Its not like the ticket will vanish from the database.
