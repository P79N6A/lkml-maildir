This is no argument when talking about hard disks.  You are talking
only about floppy disks.  I think you are smart enough to leave out
the gzip files if you are building for a floppy.
The zipped .config is considerably smaller than the system map, only
about 4K in size.  Surely you would have no problem with that?

OK, I'm thinking about it that way.  I concluded that somebody who
accidently selects both the 'bzImage includes System map' and 'bzImage
includes System config' options then complains that the boot file is
too big needs to be selected out.
Please note that when you're talking about idiots you're talking about
people like me and Alan, and we idiots resent that. ;-)
