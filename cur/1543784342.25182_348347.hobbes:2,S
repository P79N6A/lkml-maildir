 What fun is that?  I have learned that HP/Compaq is hostile to Linux,
for one thing, which was interesting (my system is a Compaq Presario
V2312US.)
 Can you help me find out why my codec is unknown?  I gave up trying to
figure out how to get the codec ID and hacked the source to print it:
atiixp: codec 0 not available for modem
atiixp: no codec available
ALSA device list:
  #0 ATI IXP rev 2 with 0x43585430 at 0xd0003400, irq 177
So it's a Conexant codec with ID 0x30 on an atiixp.  OSS has some support
for this codec, apparently.
