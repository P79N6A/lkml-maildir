One flaw I see in the "we can turn it off whenever we want" logic is that
if you compress something when you are IO bound (no loss) then get CPU
bound and need to access it you are no needing to uncompress while you are
CPU bound. There is no way to predict this potential loss (although
depending on the compression it may be very fast to uncompress)

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
