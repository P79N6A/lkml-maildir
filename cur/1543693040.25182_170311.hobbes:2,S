Oh crap, you're mapping /dev/mem rather than going through a device driver.
/dev/mem isn't setting VM_IO.
Does this little experiment make it go?

Course I could test it myself...
I wonder what to do.  Perhaps /dev/mam should set VM_IO if any of the
mapped pages are not valid mem_map-style pageframes.  Or maybe it should
just set VM_IO all the time.
