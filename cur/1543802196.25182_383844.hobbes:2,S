Ok, got some info.
Following Dave's theory that, given that I hit bad_page() sometimes
during the crash that might actually be the first thing I hit before
hitting BUG(), I added an infinite loop at the end of bad_page() so it
would stay on screen for me to write down - and bad_page() turns out
to actuall *be* the very first thing I hit.
Here's what bad_page printed for me :
