In principle ACPI shouldn't be needed, but in its absence the
BIOS must provide an MP table and the x86-64 kernel must still
have code to parse it -- otherwise I/O APIC mode won't work.
I don't know if that's the case or not.
I suggest you boot normally (with ACPI fully enabled) and send a
bug report to LKML and the ACPI list with the interrupt routing
info from the kernel log.
