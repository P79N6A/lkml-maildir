Yes, it fixed my problem. I had to aplly also "patch" from someone from
this list, who replied to Daniel, because in original Daniels version of
patch were two typo mistakes.

I had a look on monday into the -pre7 but it did not look like it contains

I don't know what's Arjan's patch, but Marcelo's patch applied to plain
