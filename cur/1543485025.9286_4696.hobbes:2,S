	I've really tried to avoid prolonging the thread by being quiet
until now, but here's hoping I can bring it to a more prompt end...
	For those that want to save ~10M of unneeded source tree, use
Buildkernel (see .sig for location).  In addition to running the entire
build from download to lilo, it automatically deletes the code for the
other architectures (arch and asm).  The deletion is done _after_ applying
patches so patching still works as expected.
	It doesn't delete things like sbus, mac, etc. drivers right now
because I haven't taken the time to learn which dirs are needed for which
architectures.  If it's important to you, patches are welcome!
	In an attempt to bring linux-kernel back ON-topic, I'd suggest
that buildkernel questions be brought to private mail.  _Please_.
	Cheers,
	- Bill

Unix _is_ user friendly.  It's just very selective about who its friends 
are.  And sometimes even best friends have fights.
