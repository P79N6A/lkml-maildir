Searching for the cause of some strange corruption
of the MBR I noticed that invalidate_buffers is not
guaranteed to invalidate the buffers - very unfortunate.
(Indeed, bh is removed only when bh->b_count is zero.
This means that one will get disk corruption if one
changes disks while some buffer heads still have
nonzero count.)
In this particular case the problem was caused by
fs/partitions/atari.c that did a bread() without
corresponding brelse(). [patch sent to Linus]
