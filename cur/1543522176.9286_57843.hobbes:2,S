i am curious.  given that java virtualises stuff sufficiently, couldn't a
jvm implement a many-java-threads-to-many-kernel-threads model where it
uses a pool of kernel threads as virtual CPUs to execute java code -- plus
uses native threads in a one-to-one model when calling out to native
classes?  i might be missing something, but this seems to give you the
benefits of both worlds.
(plus i think you can reduce the number of stacks in use -- so that you
don't require one native stack for each java thread... means less L2
thrashing.)
i'm also curious what functionality the kernel lacks for implementing
many-to-many threads.  one thing i can see lacking is something along the
lines of sun's SIGWAITING (sent when all lwps are blocked).
