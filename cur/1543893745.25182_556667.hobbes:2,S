Well we're actually not feeding back those 160 bits. But we are
hashing over the entire pool and feeding -that- back beforehand, which
is equivalent.

Indeed, though we actually want to keep random.c agnostic as to the
type of hash actually used.

I'd tend to agree with you. Even if we did no folding at all in this
last stage, we already do plenty of feedback. For every 80 bits
extracted, we feed back at least.. 320.
