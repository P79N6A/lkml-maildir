           Summary: cryptoloop has unresolved symbols (includes fix)
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test1
            Status: NEW
          Severity: blocking
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: andy-kernel.388488@dustman.net
Distribution: Gentoo 1.4
Hardware Environment: Athlon-XP, Nvidia NForce2 chipset
Software Environment:
Problem Description:
WARNING: /lib/modules/2.6.0-test1/kernel/drivers/block/cryptoloop.ko needs
unknown symbol crypto_alloc_tfm
WARNING: /lib/modules/2.6.0-test1/kernel/drivers/block/cryptoloop.ko needs
unknown symbol crypto_free_tfm
Steps to reproduce:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP=m
# CONFIG_CRYPTO is not set
Fix: Obviously CONFIG_CRYPTO should be set. This is due to an error in the
Kconfig. When the following patch is applied, the BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP option will
not appear unless CRYPTO is set, which fixes the unresolved symbol problem
(works with both on or both off):
