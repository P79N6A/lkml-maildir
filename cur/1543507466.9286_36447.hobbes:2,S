There are mainboards with the MPV3 chipset which run perfectly
with both options enabled, the "CPU to PCI write buffer" and the
"Peer Concurrency". So do (in four cases) the DFI-PB5V3+ mainboards,
and it seems to be a problem related to the implementation of the chipset
on the mainboards,  and NOT a generic chipset-problem of the MVP3.
Disabling these options generally would mean a big performance loss
for those who have such mainboards it works (on the new DFI mainboard
it works also, I heard a few days ago).

I appended the output of "lspci -xxxvvv" of my machine below.
