For interrupt-driven mode: irq=auto dma=nofifo
For PIO mode: irq=auto dma=none
For DMA mode: irq=auto dma=auto
You need to check the 'dmesg' output after parport_pc has loaded to
see exactly what it will use though (i.e. whether it has detected
usable hardware).
The line that goes 'parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778)' is the
important one.  Ignore the stuff in [brackets] at the end; if an
interrupt is mentioned it is using it; if a DMA channel is mentioned,
it is using it; and if it says 'using FIFO' then it's using the FIFO
with programmed IO (rather than DMA).
