The log is very odd - why are there two lines with

Did you rmmod/insmod the driver twice?
Could you manually insmod the driver, wait for two seconds and then call 
ifup? The new driver
- resets the phy during _probe. The result is no link for a few seconds, 
until autonegotiation has completed.
- check if there is a link during _open(). If there is a link, it's 
used. If there is no link, then it relies on the link irq to detect it.
I frequently see the "no link" messages during ifup, but on my system 
the driver recovers as soon as the autonegotiation is completed. Perhaps 
I must add a link handling timer that polls for link changes.
If a delay before ifup is not enough: manually call nv_link_irq even if 
NVREG_IRQ_LINK is not set. If this is not enough: comment out the 
NVREG_MIISTAT_LINKCHANGE test in nv_link_irq.
