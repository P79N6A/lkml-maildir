Sorry, I have been having this nasty habit of sending out unfinished e-mail 
lately(mis-clicks). Anyways in summary a large affirmative no from key 
players would solidify Linux's position as being a collaborative and open

who are giving support like Novell and IBM a better idea and a concrete 
example of what open source and collaborative development is all about.
