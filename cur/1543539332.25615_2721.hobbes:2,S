Hi.
I think there's a little bug in the order things get initialized.
If IrDA is compiled into the kernel it will fail to boot complaining
about get_random_bytes() getting called before initializing the
random number generator.
Distro is Redhat 6.2, on a Compaq Armada M300 notebook,
p3/500. Thanks.
