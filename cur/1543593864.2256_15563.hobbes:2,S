Hi all, this is an old thread. It was started because the return value
from cd info was changed in 2.4.1 in the case when the tray might be
open or there simply be no disc in the drive for an IDE
CD-ROM.

Unfortunately changing the return code means that the generic cdrom.c
code is broekn, in particular wrt to having the cdrom drive open
automatically when umounted, and to close when attempted to be
mounted. 
(You can set this mode with "cdd auto" if you have my asm-toys installed

)
The following patch fixes that. I also attempted to fix up similar
problems (where checking CDS_TRAY_OPEN is used to see if the tray is
open, which is obviously broekn).
