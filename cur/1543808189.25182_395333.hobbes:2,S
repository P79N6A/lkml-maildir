  Hi John,
  I think it's an RSA1 card, but no certainty here. I don't think
the x440 came with the RSA2. Is there a way to check for sure without
unplugging everything (It's such a mess of cables behind the box)?
  Whats the SMI issue with the RSA? Could the RSA generate bursts of SMI
that could be enough to freeze the CPUs?
  When I ran those tests I was logged on the RSA (serial line). I will
try to run the tests again without being connected when I can manage to
get some CPU time (eh! shared machine)...
  Thanks.
  Sébastien.
