Download pmstats from

 you may
need to edit it a bit for correct ACPI battery values. But it should
show you HZ during idle and load. I believe idle still does not go
to ACPI C3 with dyn-tick though...
Then you might as well run timetest from same location too to make
sure your clock keeps correct time.

Yeah, I'll fix those...
