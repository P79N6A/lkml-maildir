It is a performance tweak, not a new feature.  2.5 is for things like 
reiser4.  Also, remember that we do perform internal testing, and we 
also tested this on our mailing list, which makes our tweaks much more 
stable than most of the tweaks that go into 2.5 first. It is strange, 
but Namesys seems to have much more of a release management 
infrastructure than most code submitters (I think that means merely that 
we have one;-), since there are two persons that test every patch, and 
that makes us oddly unusual).   However, waiting for 2.4.21pre1 is also 
quite reasonable since the number of lines of new code is significant, 
and reiserfs is used on mission critical servers.   A lot depends on 
just how soon 2.4.20 is planned to come out, and only Marcelo knows that.
