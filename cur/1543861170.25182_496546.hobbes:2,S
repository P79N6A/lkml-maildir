If the code code is like
	u64 user_id;
	u32 kernel_id = user_id;
(or different types, just showing the difference in word
lengths here) it's easiest and safest to do
	BUG_ON(kernel_id != user_id);
i.e. cast back up to 64-bit, see if it's identical to the
original.  You won't have to worry about sign extensions or
similar that way, the BUG_ON() condition expresses the actual
requirement directly.
