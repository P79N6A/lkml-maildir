Wrong. You are confused between file perms & mode of access to files. 
If you cannot open a file due to insufficient perms, then EACCESS is
what you get.
If you opened a file for reading, but you tried to write, the you get a EBADF.
Run the following code, after you create two files, 'foo' ( perms 0400
) and 'bar' ( 0700 ).
#include <fcntl.h>
int main()
{
        int fd;
        fd = open("foo",O_WRONLY);
        if(fd < 0)
                perror("Opening foo:");
        else
                close (fd);
        fd = open("bar",O_RDONLY);
        if(fd < 0)
                perror("Opening bar: ");
        else {
                if(write(fd,'a',1) < 0)
                        perror("Write to bar failed: ");
                close(fd);
        }
}
Output would be:
Opening foo:: Permission denied
Write to bar failed: : Bad file descriptor
