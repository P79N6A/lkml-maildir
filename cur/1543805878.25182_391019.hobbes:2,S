Interesting...  What does that do to e.g. DVD with full (OK, modulo missing
early versions) kernel history all way back to 0.01?
Even funnier question is what does that do to full CVS including the
early versions.  Can that be distributed at all and what license would
fit it?  Arguing that it's mere aggregation is possible, but it's a
bit of a stretch...
