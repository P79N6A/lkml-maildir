Linux sends UDP fragments in reverse order. So yes - most definitely

Probably very little. There are lots of more productive things you could do
to speed it up without breaking the behaviour. Things like special casing
reverse order packets(thats the easiest for a receiver btw) as you know the
packet size for the final frame immediately so can reassembl in place

It also occurs with UDP sending larger frames than the MTU - hence it happens
a lot with UDP. In fact thats the major source of fragmented frames nowdays
