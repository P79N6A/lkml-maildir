Ah, yes, I used to use RCS in order to generate the patches that I
sent to use.  The RCS directories were short-term, and never lasted
longer until the next kernel release.  I'm kind of surprised that I
actually had archives that had RCS files, since tsx-11 should have
just had the original tar.gz files from ftp.cs.helsinki.edu.  Maybe
for some reason the original files got nuked and I replaced it with
one of my saved files at one point.  I dunno....
