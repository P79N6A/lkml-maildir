Hang on.  Having msleep(1) sleep for 20 milliseconds is really awful
behaviour.  Possibly worse is the fact that with other configs, it will
delay for eight milliseconds.  Or two.  That's an order of magnitude of
unpredictability which can actually cause driver breakage.
Fixing that *bug* is a good thing.  I see no reason why we should "keep
hrtimer usage where it is required"?  The implementation details are hidden
from the caller.
It seems to be a sensible change to me and I fail to understand the
objection.

But apart from needlessly fattening the kernel API, that leaves us in the
current situation where an unknown number of the msleep() callers actually
care that they are calling a function which by a huge margin fails to do
what they are asking it to do.  It will take a long time to hunt down all
the problematic callsites and migrate them to nanosleep().
