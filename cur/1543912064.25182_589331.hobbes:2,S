I think I've misread the reworked NAPI net_rx_action code. I thought 
that it ran each device ->poll() just once, rescheduling the NET_RX 
softirq again if a device stayed in polled mode. I can see now that it 
loops while one or more devices stays in the poll list for up to a 
jiffy, just like it always has. So by keeping the device in the poll 
list and not consuming quota, net_rx_action() spins until the next jiffy 
tick unless another device consumes quota, like you say.
I can only assume that the encouraging results that I get with this 
scheme are specific to my test setups (measuring packet forwarding 
rates). I agree that it isn't desirable to tie up the CPU for up to a 
jiffy in net_rx_action() in order to do this. I need to go away and 
rework my ideas. Perhaps it is possible to get the behavior I'm looking 
for by somehow special-casing the zero return from ->poll() in 
net_rx_action(), but I'm not sure.
Thanks for asking questions.
