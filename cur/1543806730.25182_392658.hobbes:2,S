This can't legally happen.  Do the DMCA prevent "circumventing"
even when you have the legal right to make copies of the content?
(If so, then the music industry breaks DMCA when manufacturing
their protected CDs from a protected master . . .)
If so, then step (1) is illegal because it breaks with the GPL. 
Remember, when you distribute something under the GPL, you cannot
impose restrictions.  It is well established that you can't link in
something with a more restrictive commercial licence, for example. 
I think adding that DRM falls in the same trap - if the DMCA really
impose this additional restriction (because DRM-breaking is illegal
even when content copying is not) then you are not allowed to
add that restriction. 
Someone distributing DRM-protected kernels are breaking
copyrigth law then, if the DMCA is so strict.
