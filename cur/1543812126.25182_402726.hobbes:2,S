I think it's fairly safe and obvious to say that Dominik is the peer
review for these tables - he _is_ the PCMCIA maintainer, he _is_
arguably the maintainer for the ide-cs driver, he _is_ the person
who invented these tables, he _is_ the one taking patches from people
to add IDs, he _is_ the one reviewing such patches.
If you want to know what's going on in PCMCIA land, subscribe to
linux-pcmcia.  In the same way that if you want to know what's going
in in IDE land, you subscribe to linux-ide, or PCI land linux-pci,
SCSI land linux-scsi, network land netdev.
Using your argument (which seems to be demanding that any patch to
any IDE driver no matter how trivial must be on linux-ide) that a patch
to a PCI network device driver must be copied to linux-pci and netdev
even though it may not touch the PCI specific code.
What about a cardbus network card?  Should any patch no matter how
trivial be sent to netdev, linux-pci and linux-pcmcia - all those three
mailing lists are within the "sphere of influence" of any patch to that
driver.
