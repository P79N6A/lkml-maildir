the call you need is:
       setpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, tid, -20);
where 'tid' is the TID (pid) of the thread in question. There's no way i
know of to utilize the pthread_t ID to do this, so you'll have to figure
the TID out via gettid() - which needs to happen in the child context -
how hard would it be to attach the TID field to some per-thread Jack
structure? [while the purpose is still a quick hack.]
