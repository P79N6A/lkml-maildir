I think it can asnwer your question:
Q: But wait, I really want udev to automatically load drivers when they
   are not present but the device node is opened.  It's the only reason I
   like using devfs.  Please make udev do this.
A: No.  udev is for managing /dev, not loading kernel drivers.
Q: Oh come on, pretty please.  It can't be that hard to do.
A: Such a functionality isn't needed on a properly configured system. All
   devices present on the system should generate hotplug events, loading
   the appropriate driver, and udev will notice and create the
   appropriate device node.  If you don't want to keep all drivers for your
   hardware in memory, then use something else to manage your modules
   (scripts, modules.conf, etc.)  This is not a task for udev.
