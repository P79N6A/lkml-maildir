I'm afraid nobody at linux-kernel can help you here as the nokia_c110
driver consists of a large binary-only module which "taints" the kernel
makes it undebuggable. The documentation says the driver has only been
tested up to (unpatched)  2.4.12 kernel .. your best chance is to 
a) Make sure you have the latest version of the driver & firmware
   (some earlier version was known to be broken with 2.4.6 or so upwards) 
b) Contact Nokia product support and hope they'll fix this in a future 
   release.
P.S. Sorry but even though I come from @nokia.com address I can't help you 
with this as I don't have (and wouldn't be able to get to) the source to 
the binary part either :(
