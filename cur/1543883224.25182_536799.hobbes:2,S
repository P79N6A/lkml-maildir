It is a private header file, only one file uses it and it is not supposed to
be used by any other file ever, either.  I can certainly do a cleaning up
and a lot can be removed (at least 70% of it), but the driver is not linear
(it is some infrastructure and various subdrivers) and there is a bunch of
stuff that will need forward declarations regardless.
Maybe I should just break the driver into multiple files in a subdirectory?
That would certainly make it *much* cleaner...
