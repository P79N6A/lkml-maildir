Hello,
I looked at some messages received nightly and noticed the following
errors during a dump of one of our servers :
  DUMP: 22.21% done, finished in 2:20
  DUMP: bread: lseek fails

There are no entries in /var/log/messages at the same time, so I guess
that something is corrupted on the partition itself.
Configuration : 2.2.10-ac10 (I have yet to try a 2.2.12),
# cat /proc/scsi/ncr53c8xx/0 
General information:
  Chip NCR53C875, device id 0xf, revision id 0x3
  IO port address 0xd800, IRQ number 12
  Using memory mapped IO at virtual address 0xc3810000
  Synchronous period factor 12, max commands per lun 32
The SCSI card is an Asus UW.
Any idea ?
Thanks,
A+,
