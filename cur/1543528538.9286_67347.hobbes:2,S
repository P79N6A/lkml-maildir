David, sorry for calling you Dave first off... I thought I saw you
called that before.  It seems something else is the problem too.  I
still get the exact same symptoms with that code enabled with your
changes.
Is it possible one of the n->whatever = someoddthing lines is magical
and needs to be there?  I am going to dig into this skb_copy_expand
thing.  Below are the few that I think might be the trick:
            n->list=NULL;
            n->sk=NULL;
            n->h.raw=skb->h.raw+offset;
            n->nh.raw=skb->nh.raw+offset;
            n->mac.raw=skb->mac.raw+offset;
            n->is_clone=0;
            atomic_set(&n->users, 1);
            n->destructor = NULL;
I definitely do not know enough to rule out any of the other lines, but
it seems they just do what a copy might do.  The other option is still
is skb_copy_expand broken?
I do so appreciate your help David.  I hope with your help and that of
others I can wrap this up and make the patch open to all knowing that it
works.
Sincerely, with much gratitude,
Trever Adams
