True. This is a more general problem that needs a more general solution.

For the console system yes. I also have rewritten the console code to
reentry since this is required in a multihead enivornment. At least I
hope. As for raw hardware device access like /dev/dsp and /dev/fb I
haven't figured away around that yet.
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
