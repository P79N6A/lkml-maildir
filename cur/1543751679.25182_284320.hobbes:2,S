True, I never thought of that, however, you still can drop the test,
there's no point continuing if you detected a lock prefix.

You're right, in practice I've never seen a processor trigger an
exception when it encounters a nonsensical rep prefix, so dropping the
tests for 0xf2 and 0xf3 could potentially miss cases in the unlikely
event that a compiler generated them. Not relevant here, but that
strange technique to mark the instructions would backfire on 128-bit and
64-bit media instructions that use 0xf2 and 0xf3 in the encoding.
