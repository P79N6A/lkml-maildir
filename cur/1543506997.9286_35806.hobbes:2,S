I believe the reason many of the duplicates exist is to make syscall
emulation for foreign binaries easier - where things were different, they
could be made to match the 'native' OS. I don't think this is much of a
concern these days. It now makes more sense for Linux to aim to minimize
its own cross-platform differences for the sake of keeping the kernel
manageable.
