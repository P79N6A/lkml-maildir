   That's exactly what surprised me. He rejected complete patch and
   accepted something incomplete and broken.
No, it was not broken, because he told me completely where he
was going with his changes.  He was building infrastructure piece by
piece, and that's always an acceptable way to do things as long
as it is explained where one is going with the changes.
Your stuff was unacceptable from the start because you didn't put
the ->owner into the protocol ops.
   I thought changes like that are always discussed on the lkml.
No, networking patches can go solely to netdev or linux-net.
