Thanks - I'll try to do some basic testing this weekend.  I won't get
a chance to do any extensive testing for the next two weeks because
I'll be on vacation.

Well, each member of a group has its own family.  I don't see any need
to enable/disable the top-level (parent) counter separately from its
children, but as you say, if the need arises we can add that.
We can enable/disable individual subsidiary group members (and their
families) since we have an fd for each member.  We would only need
separate 'single counter' and 'group' ioctls for the group leader, and
once again we could add that if the need arises.
Currently the ioctls on the group leader disable/enable the whole
group.  I'm not sure that enabling/disabling individual counters in
the group will really be all that useful, but I put it in for
subsidiary counters since it falls out pretty easily and naturally in
the code.  If users want to disable/enable each counter in a group
individually, they could add an extra dummy counter (say a cpu_clock
counter) to be the group leader and then just mostly ignore it.
So I think that boils down to saying that what I have implemented is
the single variant that you propose in your last quoted paragraph
above. :)

OK.  Is there any advantage of the task_clock over the cpu_clock?
Could we get rid of task_clock (and therefore remove the
curr_rq_lock_* calls) and just use the cpu_clock?
Also, since we know we're only taking differences between readings on
the same cpu, could we use sched_clock() instead of cpu_clock() to
reduce overhead?  (We certainly could on powerpc, since we have
synchronized timebase registers, but I know you don't have that luxury
on x86. :)
