The Magic Technology has ignored my requests to provide documentation for
either Intel or Phillips based version of their kit. The mct_u232 was
developed by reverse engineering the code, so it's probably not a good

Why did you omit Keyspan? I thought they had reasonable policies, if we
ignore debian-legal issue for the moment.
