We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.16.15
kernel.  Fixes for SCTP security issues.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.16.14 and 2.6.16.15, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.16.y git tree can be found at:
 	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.16.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
	www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
-chris
