Is WAG some sort of translation?
I agree with exporting the information that the kernel works out to
user-space. That is truly good.
What I'm saying is, is it not possible to only export LBA information? I
hate to see disk geometry everywhere (fdisk, hdparm, /proc/ide...) when the
CHS idea is now just an abstract way of looking at the disk - and doesn't
get close to how things are layed out on big disks anyway.
The sooner CHS information is not exported, the better, IMHO
TIA,
    - Dan
