Happens on x86, AVR32, and non-PXA ARM too.  Came from some PXA cleanup
patches.  Eric, didn't you have a patch for this?
(Of course I *still* don't understand why kconfig bothers to look
at reverse dependencies whose "forward" ones can never be satisfied.
If it stopped looking at those, lots of similar problems would vanish.)
