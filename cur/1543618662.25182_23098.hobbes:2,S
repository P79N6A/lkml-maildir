i'm using something like this, hence the structured extraction of all
relevant parameters in -J6. It's very useful for testing. We do not want
to slow down the scheduler with runtime parameters though (and it's just
way too easy to change fundamental behavior of the scheduler by changing
the paramters), so this should definitely remain a development-helper
patch.
