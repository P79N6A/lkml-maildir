In generic_ide_resume, rqpm.pm_step gets set to
ide_pm_state_start_resume and ide_do_drive_cmd gets called. This ends up
being passed through to start_request. start_request waits for the BSY
bit to go away. On the affected hardware I've seen, this never happens
unless the ACPI calls are made. As far as I can tell, there's nothing in
the current driver code that does anything to make sure that the bus is
in a state to accept commands at this point - the pci drivers don't (for
the most part) seem to have any resume methods. Calling the ACPI _STM
method before attempting to do this magically makes everything work.
