Upon adding some debugs, I find that it dumps core file upto
4096 bytes and after that, when pipe_write() notices that the 
free memory is less than the requested size, it checks for 
pending signals and exits from pipe_write().
But note that the user-level application on the read end of
the pipe does get to process the 4096 bytes since I get
a compressed core file. Problem is that the writer bails out
after 4K.
Any ideas ?
Thanks,
Ravi

Randy,
Thanks for the pointers to the patches. 
I am now able to see the core getting streamed to a program (such as
gzip). 
But I see that the core itself is quite small (truncated). 
I see this behavior even when using the normal core_pattern (without the
"|" ). Wonder if it has something to do with the changes to binfmt_elf.c
? I'm not sure why these changes are required for pipe support.
Thanks,
Ravi

I don't know if these patches 1/3 and 2/3 represent the complete
infrastructure that Andi referred to, but you can find them here:
