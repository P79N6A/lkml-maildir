Syscalls are supposed to be called from userspace, so that the kernel 
does something on behalf of an application.
Some syscalls have their do_<syscall name> equivalent because it makes 
sense to call them from inside the kernel, but others don't.
If you want to use semaphores inside the kernel I suggest you read the 
Rusty Rusell's Unreliable Guide to Kernel Locking first:
http://wwwos.inf.tu-dresden.de/~ch12/diplom/DocBook/kernel-locking/
I hope this helps,
