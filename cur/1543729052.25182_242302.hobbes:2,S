Does the patch expose the VPD as text?  Either way, what's the format?

Sounds good to me...  I like the idea of a consistent way of getting
at VPD.  Perhaps then HAL would get at it too.

For PCI 2.0/2.1 VPD in expansion ROMs the recent patch to expose the
ROMs in sysfs is probably enough.  The likely brokenness of ROMs and
the VPD means that trying to special-case around brokenness should
probably be done outside the kernel.
However, I could be wrong: there is something to be said for
consistency...
peace & happiness,
