I have to admit that I should've noticed that - aeons ago, somebody
pointed out to me that the following directories and their contents
MUST all reside in the root partition...
	/bin
	/lib
	/sbin
...and it's for this reason that the following directories exist...
	/usr/bin
	/usr/lib
	/usr/sbin
...as the former should only contain those files necessary for
booting, with the latter containing the remaining files of each type.

Who was it said that maintenance is 10% inspiration and 90%
persperation? Whoever it was certainly got things right...

Good...

Let's hope so...

There is one problem you may be able to help with, but it's not
directly kernel related so I'll email re it separately...
Best wishes from Riley.
