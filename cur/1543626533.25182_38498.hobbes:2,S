I sort of get the impression that this is overdesign. Either you're a
"core subsystem" or a "external driver". I don't see much of a point
of protecting core subsystems from eachother; they are (assumed to be) part
of the upstream kernel source anyway so they are subject to peer review by
the subsystem maintainers... Since such core subsystems use very initimate
knowledge of "bzImage internals" I can even see the point in using a
rather strict "modversions like" system to make 100% sure that the
core subsystem modules and the base kernel match (random cookie that is
generated for each build and not available outside the build environment
??).
I say "external driver" even though the source can be in the
kernel tree; for this that doesn't make much of a difference,
most "drivers" don't need to know about core internal things and can
be compiled outside the tree already; they're in tree for convenience (and
for easing doing mass API changes etc etc etc).
