oh, i see. (i was used to setting this in the fs, this is why i missed it) 
I think encoding holes in this way is bad, it will prevent legitimate uses
of the very same bit-combination: (!Mapped && Uptodate) will be useful if
we'll ever do 'delayed allocation' of filesystem blocks, it will represent
pretty ordinary blocks which are not yet mapped to the filesystem.
