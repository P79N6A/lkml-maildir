I'm not sure, but AFAIK, most (all?) Intel motherboard
chipsets do not (can't?) support LBA mode on the secondary
controller. I beleive this was just because the secondary
chain was only only ever supposed to have CDROM's on it.
You *could* override this in the kernel, but that makes
it unusable from another OS.
At least i think this is the way it is....
