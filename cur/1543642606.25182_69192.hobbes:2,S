Martin had this profile for a kernel build on 2.5.31-mm1:
c01299d0 6761     1.28814     vm_enough_memory

We can make nr_free_pages go away by adding global free page 
accounting to struct page_states.  So we're accounting it in
two places, but it'll be simple.
The global page accounting is very much optimised for the fast path at
the expense of get_page_state().  (And that kernel didn't have the
rmap speedups).
We need to find some way of making vm_enough_memory not call get_page_state
so often.  One way of doing that might be to make get_page_state dump
its latest result into a global copy, and make vm_enough_memory()
only get_page_state once per N invokations.  A speed/accuracy tradeoff there.
