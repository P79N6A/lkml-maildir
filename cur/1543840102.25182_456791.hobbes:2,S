not for each, just a lock for a list for for_each_process ;)
About cache bounsing, it's problem if heavy.
In my plan, fork/exit/proc_readdir will have write lock of
for_each_process_write_lock. talking this again after take3 will be good.
If I'm very lucky, I'll find some another way..

BTW, what position means at lseek() in directory ? 
bytes ? implementation dependent ? 
I'm thinking of implementing "position" as offset in task list. 
Hmm..about lseek(), it's obvious that searching in a table has an advantage.
we cannot define position with list.
What will you do if user moves f->pos to not-used-position.
I have no complaint about pidmap scanning next_tgid() unless it doesn't scan
all over the world.
