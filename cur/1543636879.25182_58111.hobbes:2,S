See the other poster's comment about providing a clear separation of kernel
and userspace components in your source tree.  It just makes it easier to
get oriented.

Hard realtime isn't about efficiency, it's about meeting deadlines.  While 
you may be seeing very good average interrupt response latency in Linux, it's 
well known that response times on the order of milliseconds are not uncommon, 
and there is no way to prove that you won't get the occasional spike into the 
tens or hundreds of milliseconds, even with low latency patches applied to 
spinlocks and preemption enabled.  Hard realtime is about being able to prove 
that such spikes never happen.  As a bonus, you can work with much smaller 
packet sizes because you have confidence that you'll be able to service the 
interrupts on time.
That said, Adeos does offer what appears to be an very efficient model for 
handling interrupts.  (Caveat: I haven't tried it myself yet, much less 
measured it, just eyeballed the code)  You can load a module directly into
the interrupt pipeline and bypass all of Linux's interrupt machinery, even
bypass cli (it just sets a flag in Adeos).
In any event, it's not clear to me how you are going to be able to do echo 
cancelation reliably unless you are able to provide guaranteed response
latency.

An interrupt rate of 20 KHz is no problem on modern hardware, in fact I
was able to that with a 20 MHz 386.  What is your sample rate?
