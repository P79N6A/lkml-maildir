Looks nice, starting to look it over.
Notes:
Getting started:
  There are RPM packages available (I think they are for latest Fedora; in
  case of doubt get the latest SRPM and build yourself, sometimes the
  distros lag /way/ behind). There are also Debian packages there, dunno
  about those.
Basic tasks:
  'git pull' should be enough, no need to give the URL each time.
  It is useful to tell people how to get "nonofficial" branches (via URL +
  branches) too.
Miscellaneous debris:
  'git pull' has gotten tags each time for me?
