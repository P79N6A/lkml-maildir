All touchscreens get calibrated once during their production AFAIK. This
should result at least in a "useable" resolution. ...but have a tight
look at today's touches: their [xy]{min,max} values don't cover all the
theoretical range of values that could be sent with the protocol in use.
Just taking an example, one screen here (it has never ever been
physically recalibrated except right after production) used values (for
X as well as for Y) in the range of about [350..3800]. The protocol does
allow a lot more...

It's not :)  The foil layers aren't all that equal after production.
They're (from the protocol point of view) generalized by calibrating
them once (during production). However, if the screen gets injured, this
must either be re-done, or the screen may need to be replaced. However,
replacing parts in the field is expensive and service staff tries to not
do that, but instead a recalibration is tried first. IFF the touchscreen
is then found to be *really* dead, it's replaced.

But it needs to know the exact range of possible resistance/capacity to
be able to do that. This is where the trouble starts that I'm talking
about. Of course you can *assume* that capacity will be in a
(well-known) range (you know the range because you can just test a
production example), but this range is a bit different for each
touchscreen produced, let alone the fact that the foils may get
scratches or other injuries. In a bad case, you get a near-short-circuit
so that your (new) range of values is near-zero. Recalibrating the A/D
converter may revive this almost-dead screen.

Right, but there are two kinds of calibration:
(1) Mapping the raw capacity/resistor values (that only the TS controller
    is aware of) to something the HID API can output. (This, too, includes
    that the kernel dictates the range of values that can be reached).
(2) Mapping the range of reachable HID coordinates to actual on-screen
    pixels. (This accounts for a person't fat and/or un-even fingers...)
"Calibration" in X11 with all it's drivers is done at the (2) level. You
first have to figure out the range of generated values and then place
these as [xy]{min,max} values.
However, the hardware-internal mapping (1) isn't covered anywhere right
now. This usually isn't much of a problem during real use, but it *is* a
problem if the hardware ever gets damaged (or the controller's flash
breaks). Ever tried to use a serial sniffer on vendor's original MS
Windows drivers? They almost always update the controller's internal
mapping, too.

This is nice, but even cannot be done with all TS controllers. The very
old ones actually just hand over the pure A/D values as a 10bit integer.
For sure, you won't ever see a touchscreen that covers the whole scale:)

ACK. We'd do a lib for that and have a X11 driver to make use of it.
