Subject: ACPI problems with a Presario 2700...

I'm trying to get ACPI working on a Presario 2700, but I'm running into 
a problem:
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20040326
ACPI: IRQ9 SCI: Level Trigger.
Has anyone seen this before and have some idea how to fix it?  Or does 
the 2700 just have a really crappy ACPI implementation? :-)
