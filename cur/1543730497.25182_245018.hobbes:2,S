The find-like program I use (called treescan) uses O_DIRECTORY as an
optimisation.  It assumes that O_DIRECTORY will only open objects
which are directories and can be read using readdir().
However, if reiser4 returns d_type values, then it won't even attempt
an open on non-DT_DIR objects, and that's a better optimisation.
(reiserfs doesn't return d_type values, unfortunately).
So the list of files that treescan finds depends on whether reiser4
implements d_type.
This is nothing like a POSIX filesystem.  You untar a tree, and then
listing it recursively shows extra things created by reiser4.
I quite like the principle, but because it's not like POSIX and
doesn't match some program's expectations, it's a problem in its
present form.
xattrs aren't a complete solution as you can't store structured data
in an xattr.  For example, with reiser4's model, you can cd into a
.tar, .zip, .mp3 or .xml file and list the internal structure along
with the file's metadata.  You can't do that with xattrs.
Programs exist which quite reasonably assume that when you create a
file, you can't opendir() the file, and recursive listings (like find,
ls -R et al.) won't automatically traverse into every file.
On the other hand, being able to enter a file in a directory-like way
allows structured representations of the contents to be accessed in
the very useful "everything's a file" way -- i.e. ordinary tools.
So here's a semantic proposal:
   1. O_DIRECTORY won't open an ordinary file.
      Corollary: opendir("file") won't open an ordinary file.
   2. An ordinary file path followed by "/" won't open an ordinary file.
      Corollary: opendir("file/") won't open an ordinary file.
      This is because appending a trailing slash is an alternate
      way for userspace to get the same results as O_DIRECTORY.
   3. An ordinary file path followed by "/" _and_ one or more path
      components will open the file as a directory and enter it.
      Corollary: opendir("file/.") will open an ordinary file.
   4. The type of "file/." shall be S_IFDIR, _not_ S_IFREG.
      Corollary: stat("file/.") will return that it's a directory.
      The intention here is that explicit requests to examine the
      metadata or alternate structure representations of a file will
      create such a view, but the view is only available if requested
      explicitly.
      When such a view is created, the results of stat(), O_DIRECTORY
      and opendir() are absolutely consistent.  This will minimise
      confusion.  Programs which recurse over a directory tree won't
      look inside any of the files.  However they can be explicitly
      asked to recurse starting from a path inside a file: then
      they'll recurse over a single file's metadata and structured data.
Regarding the problems of safe locking in the VFS.  The VFS assumes
that directories are not hard linked: i.e. that they cannot appear at
more than one path in a filesystem.  Files-as-directories breaks that.
However, VFS does support directories on multiple paths, using bind mounts.
So it wouldn't be out of the question if entering a file (as described
above) effectively auto-mounted a bind mount at that point.
