Subject: [SCRIPT] chomp: trim trailing whitespace

Attached to this email is chomp.pl, a Perl script which removes trailing 
whitespace from several files.  I've had this for years, as trailing 
whitespace is one of my pet peeves.
Now that git-applymbox complains loudly whenever a patch adds trailing 
whitespace, I figured this script may be useful to others.
