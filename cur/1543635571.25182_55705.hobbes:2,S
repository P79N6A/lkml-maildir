Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt. Also, DAC960 initial bio conversion
happened before the interface was finalized, so it may need changes in
that regard as well. Documentation/block/biodoc.txt is your friend there
:-)
a quick make drivers/block/DAC960.o shows the following stuff needs
changing immediately:
1) q->queue_lock is a pointer to a lock, not the lock itself. Probably
add a per-controller spinlock to DAC960_Controller_T, and pass that to
blk_init_queue(). Then change DAC960_AcquireControllerLock and friends
in DAC960.h accordingly.
2) wrt DMA mapping, see DAC960_BA_WriteHardwareMailbox
   (Virtual_to_Bus64, anyone?)...
And probably lots more will unearth once you start tackling it...

Heh, not at all :-)
