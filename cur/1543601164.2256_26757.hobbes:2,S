I think I get your idea now.  swap_device_lock stays where it was.
You want to move swap_list_lock out of get_swap_page, use it to
bracket swap_duplicate with add_to_swap_cache and get_swap_page
with add_to_swap_cache, easily done without changing interfaces,
since swap_duplicate doesn't currently use it at all.
That does add further locking in read_swap_cache_async, but if BKL
goes, I think that's okay; and it's a neat way to keep the familiar
primitives with little change.  I'll give it a try.
