Dear USB developers,
In 2.6.9, 'usb-storage' module depends on 'scsi_mod', but not 'sd_mod'.
This means that I have to load 'sd_mod' manually, or put something like
    alias block-major-8-* sd_mod
in /etc/modprobe.conf.
Is there reason why 'sd_mod' is not listed as one of dependant modules
for 'usb-storage'?
	Yours truly,
