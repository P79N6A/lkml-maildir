Hello,
I have some (more) expirience with epoll and threads and it seem to work
well. If you have epoll_wait() in one thread and another thread do
epoll_ctl to add a handle, epoll_wait will wake up as soon as the handle
is ready for operation (most of the time instantly, when operation is
write). 
epoll man page states:
              Q6     Will the close of an fd cause it to be removed from
all epoll sets automatically?
              A6     Yes.
but I was experiencing some (rare) segfaults with my application while
benchmarking it when I just closing my descriptors. Debugging showed,
that I'm getting events for destroyed objects (with closed descriptors).
Adding epoll_ctl(..., EPOLL_CTL_DEL, ...) fixed this.
