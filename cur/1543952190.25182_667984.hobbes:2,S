In other words, exactly how ramback works.

Right, just like the Violin 1010, whose PCI-e cable can be hotplugged
into a different server.  Or plugged into two servers at the same time,
because each 1010 has two PCI-e interfaces, so this can be done without
manual intervention.
See, we really are talking about the same thing.  Except that ramback
does it bigger and faster.
