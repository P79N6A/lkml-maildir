If the channel is frozen, is the config space still readable? 
In my case, I had to save config space data early on before
the bus error. 
What's more, I discovered that I had to save the pci config 
space data before device drivers do thier probe. During the probe, 
device drivers will change the config. For example, they'll enable
interrupts and dma. If you turn these on, and then do the probe,
you'll get spectacuar failures.
To be safe, I found the best thing to do was to save the pci
config space state as it was during boot, before the PCI probe 
routines ran.
