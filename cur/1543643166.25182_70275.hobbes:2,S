Steve,
 [shameless plug to follow]
 you may add MSC.linux (
http://www.msclinux.com
) to your list. We 
support it since day one. Probably not a mainstream reference, but we 
are working in an application field that can make good use of XFS.
 [end of shamelse plug]
 Your list of users is great, but without mainstream support its growth 
will be severely limited.
 OK, but I understand people are working to change that for 2.6 :-)
Cheers
Martin
