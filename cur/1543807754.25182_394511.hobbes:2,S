If that's what's needed to give the correct behaviour, so be it. In an
ideal world, we'd not need the dependency but it sounds unavoidable.
You can actually have a soft dependency where it could use the DC value
unless ACPI is present in which case it would be more intelligent. The
corgi_bl driver does this for the backlight limiting on low power.
