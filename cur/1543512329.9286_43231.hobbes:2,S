Again this very same oops that I have got under 2.3.18ac10 and
other people have got under 2.2.13pre15 and 2.2.10 compiled with gcc
2.7.2.3 and egcs 1.1.2. I really does look like a genuine bug in 
the dcache or somewhere else.

The very same instruction again. I have had different call
chains, but they are the same from open_namei onward.
| 	This doesn't mean anything to me, but perhaps it can help someone debug

| 
| Pentium III 450 - 440BX Chipset
| 256 megs RAM
| Adaptec AHA-2940 Ultra2 SCSI host adapter
| Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100
| Seagate ST39173LW
| HP C1557A Cartridge Tape Drive
I'm seeing a bit of a pattern here. I also have 2940U2W SCSI
adapter and Peter Hanecak also had SCSI, didn't mention the
adapter type though. If it's also Adaptec, we might have a
common denominator here, if not, it could be the SCSI-layer itself.
I also have eepro, but it should matter, should it? :) I Cc:ed
the Adaptec driver maintainer if he could be of help here.
I have SMP-system and you don't so it shouldn't be a race condition 
either.

Most probably doesn't, but you can always try :) I'm trying
2.3.20pre2 myself now.
