Subject: [PATCH] psmouse: fix ExPS/2 probing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Split off from an earlier (big and confusing) patch.
Some mice (Logitech trackballs at least) support ExPS/2 but don't support
ImPS/2. The current probing order forces all such devices to use regular
three-button PS/2. This patch fixes it by taking the ExPS/2 probing out
of the ImPS/2 if-then block.
Applies to 2.6.5, 2.6.6-rc2. Won't apply to rc2-mm1 nor on top of Dmitry's
patches.
The third part of the earlier patch fixed protocol probing, but I'll wait
2.6.6 comes out until I redo it.

  * Okay, all failed, we have a standard mouse here. The number of the buttons
