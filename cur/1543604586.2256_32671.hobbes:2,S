Isn't EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS the default case for 99.44% of modules?  It seems 
to me that the lameness incurred in adding an EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS line to 
each and every driver that one writes is a pointless additional hoop to 
jump through.  I'd rather break the modules that are relying on behaviour 
that was deprecated several *years* ago than go through another make-work 
project.
