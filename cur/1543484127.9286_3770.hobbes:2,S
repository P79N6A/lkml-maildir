3c509: found 3Com 3c529 EtherLink III (10base2) at slot 5
: 3c509 at 0x600 tag 0, BNC port, address  00 20 af 74 c8 2c, IRQ 10.
                        ^^^^^^^^
There is a lot of info printed here. Is it correct? IRQ, 10base2, etc.
You may want to go to:
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/diag/diagnostic.html
And follow the appropriate links for a diagnostics and setup utility.
For me the following is printed (in this order):
eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 60 08 62 8b d7, IRQ 10.
3c509.c:1.12 6/4/97 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
As for the oops, my completely unqualified answer is that the driver is
making recursive calls and run out of kernel stack. There is a) the output
and b) the short part of the stack trace:
Call Trace: [<c205f000>] [<c2060810>] [<c2060828>] [<c205d000>] 
[<c205f048>] [<c0108d14>] [<c205f000>] 
That's a lot of c205f000 ... :)  (no, obviously it doesn't have to be an
endless recursion)
