   - The Voodoo3 DRI driver (tdfx.o) from XFree96 4.0.1 (from the DRI
   site) will compile, but is useless with many unresolved
   symbols. The current driver in the kernel source is massively out
   of date and X will not accept it and that causes accelerated 3D to
   be turned off. Interesting catch 22... The driver from the DRI site
   works perfectly fine with test2-ac2.
Actually, I think you might get the 2.4.x-test tdfx driver to work
with the simple change below.  They merely changed the GET_MAGIC drm
ioctl to be a different value, and I suspect that any driver that does
not use the DMA buffer management ioctls (which in 4.0.1 changed
structure sizes, ioctl numbers, etc.) of the drm kernel module (such
as tdfx, ffb, etc.) will work with 4.0.1 using this change.
At least, it works perfectly fine for me using ffb Creator3D cards.
