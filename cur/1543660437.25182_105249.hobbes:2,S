Er, yes. generic_file_readonly_mmap() silently removed the VM_MAYWRITE bit 
from vma->vm_flags when init made a _PRIVATE_ writable mapping, apparently 
on the basis that we have no writepage().
Then we return success anyway.
Then init segfaults when it touches something in that mapping.
/me blames akpm. :)
