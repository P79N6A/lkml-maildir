Hi,
  ncpfs is in kernel. What is not in kernel is mount program and other
ncp based utilities. It is just with ipx package for IPX interfaces -
- you also need ipx_interface and ipx_configure to setup them up.
  You really do not want to add 3.6MB of sources of userspace ncpfs
into Linus's kernel. And I do not want it too - ncpfs has nothing to
do with kernel, you can use userspace utilities at least on AIX
and IRIX too (--disable-kernel --disable-ipx), if you have gcc/gmake 
on them, so there is no reason to bundle userspace ncpfs tools with kernel.
                                        Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
