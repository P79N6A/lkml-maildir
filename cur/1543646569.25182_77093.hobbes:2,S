IANAL, but this is just to protect BitMover against _you_ suing them for
publishing your log entries.  Completely sensible.  They're not claiming
copyright over the metadata.  They're not claiming any license over the
metadata.

It doesn't say "you transfer all your IP and soul to bitmover."

That doesn't explicitly allow bitmover to put the metadata up in public
view, which would mean the openlogging stuff will leave bitmover wide
open for legal action.

The exact same problem applies to pre-BK Linus and Alan, and whoever
else produces a change log that contains information produced by a
third party.
Does Linus and Alan have an implicit right to republish the documentation
that was sent to them with the patch?  Does Red Hat have the right to
republish comments placed into the bugzilla database by external users
of that service?  Does Debian have a right to reproduce emails on their
website which have been sent to foo@bugs.debian.org (or whatever the
address is?)
There is a _big_ question about reproducing peoples personal information
in the EU (eg, email addresses) on web sites, even archives of public
mailing lists.  The exim mailing lists were recently threatened with
legal action over this very point, and there was talk at one point about
having to shut down the whole exim.org site because of this.  The end
result of this debarcle was various posts were deleted from the list
archive.
So, this isn't a BK problem.  Its a community problem.
Please don't shovel shit into other peoples back yards.
