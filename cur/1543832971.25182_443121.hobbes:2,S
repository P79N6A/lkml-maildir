obviously you do math only on your local cpu, with the values for your
local cpu. And just never ever look at tsc values from another cpu,
consider them entirely uncorrelated for all I care ;)
Within those constraints it should be reasonably ok (there still is trouble 
if the tsc stops entirely in idle, but thats a different thing)
