Hi Linus,
setkeycodes does not work anymore on my Compaq Evo N600c running a Debian testing.
puligny:~# setkeycodes e023 150 e01e 155 e01a 217 e01f 157
KDSETKEYCODE: No such device
failed to set scancode a3 to keycode 150
Of course, the old warnings are back when I pressed one of the multimedia keys :
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xa3 on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e023 <keycode>' to make it known.
Am I supposed to do something to get it back on 2.6.11-rc1 ?
Regards
Brice
