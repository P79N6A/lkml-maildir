The thermometer he used likely showed a much lower temperature than what was 
actually on the die. 5-10 C more are not unlikely. It's hard to measure chip
temperatures accurately without an on die thermal diode or special kit.
So I would expect that when an external normal thermometer showed 50C 
it was already operating out of spec.
