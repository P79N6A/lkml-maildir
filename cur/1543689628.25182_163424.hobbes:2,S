Not sure whether you're agreeing with me or not, quite possibly
because my last comment used a double negative and was somewhat
ambiguous :-).
What I meant was that if a piece of perfect code exists, (and as you
point out, this can be mathematically _proven_ with assembler code,
not just demonstrated), the requirement for an open source assembler
other than Gas is not so much of a problem, because nobody should need
to touch that code.  If they do, they can translate it to Gas syntax.
If the possibility of bugs exists in the code, relying on
$assembler!=Gas is a bad thing, because there will be fewer people
willing to maintain it.

This is part of what makes someone a 'real' programmer, in my
opinion.
In my experience, 'Unreal' programmers tend to excessively re-use code
from other applications they've written, and just hack it about until
it works, at times leaving in code for features that are never used in
the new context :-).
