Yes. As we've already said, it's unlikely that's going to change any
time soon for those shipping kernels - licensing on the speedtouch
firmware isn't conducive AFAIK.

Piece of hardware you always thought worked one way, but doesn't.
Quick hacks for new devices/fixes for old ones, etc. etc. There are
lots of reasons you might want to change firmware logic and the idea
of doing it in two places seems a bad one to me.

I'm creating a new internal API, yes. One that I think solves the
problem for most drivers and can stick around for a while - when I say
"for the moment at least" I mean that in the same sense that any part
of the kernel stays around until someone comes along with something
new that everyone jumps at. But I think it's a useful one line patch
:-)

But there's no reason to think any different either - and I don't
think it's likely vendors are going to go out of their way for every
driver to have lengthy legal debates over licensing. If these folks
want their firmware to be distributed, then they need to facilitate
that. To be fair to QLogic, their firmware has a specific license on
it and they seem to be a player.

What's the problem? Really? It's just a file list of firmwares - if
you really can't have a list then you just have to special case the
speedtouch driver. Meanwhile, other folks are able to happily use
MODULE_FIRMWARE to advertise their firmware requirements :-)

You can specify whatever filename you like - it's down to whatever
parses the modinfo sections to rip this out in the right way at
packaging time. I strongly prefer file names.
