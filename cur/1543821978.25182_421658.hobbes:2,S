For improving performance of NFS servers I've often had good success
with increasing the 'rsize' and 'wsize' options.
The default values are 4096, I personally set them to 16384 which
usually helps NFS performance quite a bit. At least that's my
experience.
Simply add  rsize=16384,wsize=16384  to the nfs mount options in
/etc/fstab and see if that improves performance for you (values like
8192 and 32768 may also be worth testing, but personally I've found -
at least with my setups - that 16384 seems to be the magic value).
('man 8 mount' and 'man 5 exports' also have more interresting options
you may want to experiment with, but just rsize & wsize on their own
should be a boost)
