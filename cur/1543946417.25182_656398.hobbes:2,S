Sorry, my patch description was not correct. 
The new behavior of sys_tee with my patch is: 
	- return -EAGAIN if there are no data in the pipe, but writer
	  connected to the pipe, 
	- return 0 if there are not writers connected
	- else return number of duplicated byte 
The old behavior was: return -EAGAIN or the number (>0) of duplicated
bytes.

The reason, why I wrote the patch, was, that the example program
mentioned in manpage of tee(2) doesn't stop, if it used like
cat textfile | tee_example outfile | wc because sys_tee returns only
-EAGAIN or the duplicated bytes, not something like EOF.
