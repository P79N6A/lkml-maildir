Hopefully the API will simplify enough so that emulation will becomes 
easier.

I think the whole point of an async execution of a syscall or a syslet, is 
that the syscall/syslet itself includes a non interlocked operations with 
other syscalls/syslets. So that the main scheduler thread can run in a 
lockless/singletask fashion. There are no technical obstacles that 
prevents you to do it, bu if you start adding locks (and hence having 
long-living syslet-threads) at that point you'll end up with a fully 
multithreaded solution.
