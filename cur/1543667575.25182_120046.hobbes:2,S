Hi all,
I have set up a tree on kernel.org for SCM repositories.  Currently it
contains a mirror of the bk->cvs repository tree at:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/bkcvs/
The main intent for this is to make it possible to rsync the full
repository; we currently don't have CVS pserver access or anything like
that (maybe later.)
This tree is mirrored hourly from kernel.bkbits.net.
I'm hoping someone with a BK license and a kernel.org account could add
the bk exports file to this tree, as well.
