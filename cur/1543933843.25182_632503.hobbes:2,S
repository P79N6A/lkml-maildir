Hi everybody,
since yesterday my laptop kept on hard-locking when launching 32bit
binaries / apps
I didn't know what to do but
miguel botón was the one pointing me in the right direction, namely bisect :)
kudos to him & the others involved in his zen-sources project:
http://repo.or.cz/w/linux-2.6/zen-sources.git
bisect said the following is the causer:

    x86 user_regset math_emu
    This converts the ptrace/signal accessors for i387 math_emu
    state to the user_regset interface style, and calls these
    from the old interfaces.
    It also cleans up math_emulate's ptrace check to be a
    single-step check, which is what it really wants.

I'm now waiting for others to confirm it (another user of that
kernel-tree has also reported the same behavior):

it's my first run of bisect so sorry for any false-alarm caused by
