Hi,
	I have been running successfully the 2.6.x series of kernel up until the
release of 2.6.2 on my Dell Latitude C600 notebook with the Fedora Core 1
distribution and updated with the latest module-init-tools. I can still boot
into 2.6.1 and 2.4.25 fine but when 2.6.2 comes up I get the following:-
VFS: Cannot open root device "hda6" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
my grub command line is as follows:-
root=/dev/hda6 initrd=/boot/initrd-2.6.2.img rhgb
I did find there to be a similar issue with 2.6.0-test1-mm1 kernel which
someone suggested putting the actual minor major number in the root option
as shown below:-
root=0306 initrd=/boot/initrd-2.6.2.img rhgb
and I still cannot boot. I have tried the 2.6.3-rc1 and 2.6.3-rc2 releases
and get the same problem.
Is anyone else experiencing a similar problem or have a solution?
Regards
Grant Fribbens
