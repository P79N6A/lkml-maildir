Hi Ingo,
I found a race condition in my kernel which can also be found in yours.
When I trigger the printk in check_periodic_interval, interrupts are
turned on in release_console_sem.  Unfortunately, this can have an
interrupt go off there (since they are turned back on there) and the
write_lock system_time_lock will be taken again, thus producing a
deadlock.
I'm not sure if this is the best solution, but this was the easiest.
Maybe the CONFIG_PARANOID_GENERIC_TIME should be added in the warnings
in init/main.c too?
Since interrupts are kept off in the ktimer (hrtimer, whatever) in
printk, this does not affect those patches.  This is a PREEMPT_RT only
problem.
