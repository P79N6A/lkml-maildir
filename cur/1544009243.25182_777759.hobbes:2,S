This is certainly needed e.g. for code which outputs line fragments
and expects full lines in the log, such as hex dumps. But its arguable
that that code should use its own buffer to format lines, then send
only complete lines to printk.

I agree completely. I was hoping somebody could tell me how to include
'%v' in gcc's acceptable list, but it seems impossible. The alternative
then is to use '%pV%s' which gcc _should_ like (I haven't tested it,
but it seems reasonable) and reverse the order of the fmt and args
in the function call arguments.
