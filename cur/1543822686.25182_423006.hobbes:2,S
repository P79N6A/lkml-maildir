Well, I have seen several threads about this in the archive, with some
people against and some people pro. I personaly like grepping for the
declaration of function using ^name.
If this codingstyle is really required, I will do.

When TSO is disabled, we see performance being about 300Mbs lower when
enabling NAPI. But we'll probably enable TSO by default (see below) so
we'll probably drop non-NAPI.

Well... the watchdog is supposed to help detecting memory parity errors
in the NIC. It's rare, but it happens with cosmic rays. The recovery
part still need some work anyway. So we might drop the watchdog for now
and come back when recovery is ready.
Additionally, we are using our own watchdog because the linux netdev
watchdog does not seem to work well for devices with large hardware
transmit queues.  If there is a hardware problem, a single (or even a
handful) of TCP streams will not backup into the hardware queue in a
timely fashion, leading to a long delay before the netdev watchdog
routine is called.

It works. We did not enable it by default because there were some
problems in older kernels. They seem to be fixed in recent kernels. So
we'll enable TSO by default and have people disable it if it causes
problems.

Oops sorry, I forgot to apply my cleaning script before sending.

That's the firmware version, we'll find better names.
Thanks a lot for all the comments.
