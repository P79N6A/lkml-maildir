Dear kernel crew.
I follow the stable kernel and run 2.4.18 just fine on 3 machines.
Recently I thought about trying 2.4.19rc kernels.  That went fine as
well with one exception.
One machine (with 2 ethernet controllers)
 Intel Corp. 82557/8/9 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 0c)
 3Com Corporation 3c900B-TPO [Etherlink XL TPO] (rev 04)
will no longer recognise -any- of those.
Note that this 'artifact' only happens with 2.4.19rc3.  The .config
between 2.4.19rc2 did not change 2.4.19rc3
During boot I see OOPses (which for some reason, my syslog does not
see).
Because this is a rather severe change [:-)] I wonder if I this rings
a bell.
Thanks for your valuable time
