And so what do you do when there is a FEATURE for a device that
communicates via a standard protocol that doesn't map onto the
existing FEATURE set ? Simply say "sorry, you'll need a new kernel
module for that (even though we know you used to be able to just send
a generic SCSI message) ?" Or do you go for code bloat, and now
require all low level disk interfaces to support, for example,
password-controlled write-protection (the Jaz drives have this, for
example) ? This looks suspiciously like the Idiot's Veto, in that any
FEATURE present on any device has to implemented (even if just with a
stub) by all.
