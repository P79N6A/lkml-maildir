It's still racy on SMP if a thread with the same MM is modifying the LDT
between the time you check whether the selectors are valid and the iret
instruction restoring the previous stack.

Can you elaborate a bit, in which places?

And what about the little bit called TS in CR0 which is always set by 
a task switch. That's one bit of state which will be always set when
the debug interrupt returns, and the current code for FPU will be
confused by this AFAICT. Things become even more interesting if you 
want to allow debug traps between in the kernel routines using the
FPU, between kernel_fpu_begin() and kernel_fpu_end().
