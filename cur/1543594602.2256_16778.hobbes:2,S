Huh? No, this isn't the NMI timer. It's an NMI you generate
with a pushbutton on the back of your PC. My computer doesn't
have the APIC hardware needed for an NMI timer anyway.
For a PCI card, one must assert the SERR# signal. This is supposed
to be done for 1 clock cycle, on the proper clock edge. Going a bit
beyond 1 clock cycle ought to be OK, but my hand on a button is
likely to assert SERR# for millions of clock cycles. I've no idea
if my motherboard will handle that well.

I'd rather just get an oops, but even still the board would
be good to have. KGDB can be triggered by an NMI, right?
Building an NMI board would be fun, overkill or not. :-)

I don't have an APIC. I have a plain Pentium MMX. If I want
an NMI it's going to come from a pushbutton.
