I was afraid someone would tell that...
I just want to say that the 'problem' is not that threads are slow in linux,
but that others ways are faster than they 'should be if done the standard
way'.
BTW, after all I have read all POSIX threads library should be no more than
a wrapper over fork(), clone and so on. Why are they so bad then ?
I am going to get glibc source to see what is inside pthread_create...
