Hi Eric,
I have tried numa=fake=4 on intel xeon with 2.6.13 kernel it is
working fine and by adding EXPORT_SYMBOL(pgdat_list)  in
mm/page_alloc.c now I am able to access pgdat_list also. But on
opteron machine there is some problem in kernel compilation
at make install stage I am getting following warning
WARNING: No module mptbase found for kernel 2.6.13, continuing anyway
WARNING: No module mptscsih found for kernel 2.6.13, continuing anyway
now when I boot my kernel, panic is received
Booting the kernel.
Red Hat nash version 4.1.18 starting
mkrootdev: lable / not found
mount: error 2 mounting ext3
mount: error 2 mounting none
switchroot: mount failed : 22
umount : /initrd/dev failed : 22
kernel panic - not syncing : Attempted to kill init
On the other hand when I complie same source code on XEON machine this
works fine.
what could be the problem?
