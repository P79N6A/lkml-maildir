Sorry, but I think that is FUD. The disk better well be in a synced and
idle state when you power it down, regardless of how you do it. It may
refuse to talk to you after resuming, if that by some weird strike of
lightning causes corruption then you are really unlucky. It definitely
doesn't warrant a nasty warning which, as pointed out by someone else,
isn't even visible as the config selects itself.

That is indeed a nasty bug, I have a pending fix for that. It's a pretty
easy fix, just introduce a another resume step that issues the hpa
reinit like we do on boot.
