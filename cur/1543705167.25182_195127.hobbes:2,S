Hi Martin,
sorry, the code in the tree doesn't work.
I decided to try pthreads, cause I gave up with the I/O multiplexing,
forking and earning SIGCHLDS for manipulating the global lists.
The multithreaded udevd takes multiple events at the same time on a unix
domain socket, sorts it in a linked list and handles the timeouts if
events are missing.
It executes our current udev in the background and delays the execution
for events with the same DEVPATH. So we serialize the events only for
different devices.
I've posted the latest patch to the list a few minutes ago.
If you like, I'm happy to hear from your testing :)
If we decide not to stay with the threads model, cause klibc doesn't
support it now and ..., we at least have a working model to implement
in a different way.
thanks,
Kay
