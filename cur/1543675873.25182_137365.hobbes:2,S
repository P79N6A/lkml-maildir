Indeed, I saw that.  On the P4 2.66ghz that you have, the "second" cpu is
disabled by intel, as they sell hyperthreading only on the newer Xeon P4
(which you don't have), and the new 800FSB (4x200) units, which again
you don't have.

There is a Xeon 2.66 part, however it has 603 pins, and would not fit on
your IC7-G board, which is a P4 board, not a P4 Xeon board,
CPU0: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.66GHz stepping 07 is correct.
OT:  Are your two 100mbit cards PCI or something?  I noticed the onboard
gigabit adapter isn't detected.
