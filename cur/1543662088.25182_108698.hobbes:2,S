Sort of, yes. Making it a filesystem is more a way of making it possible for
the kernel to associate a block device directly with the caching code. Rather
than adding an additional kernel interface beyond mount/swapon, you can just
use mount to add a block device to the cache.
Furthermore, it meand that I can provide virtual files along the lines of
/proc in the mountpoint that allow you to access status information, and maybe
also control the data cached.
