Now, I'll agree with that, certainly. 
I just wanted to be clear on the purpose of the patches. The bforget() one
looks like "taking care of the details", but not like a bug-fix. Agreed?
(Which is not to say I won't apply it - I just want to make sure we have
the issues under control).

Again, I agree with you, but it looks like that is a cleanup issue rather
than a bug.

The "patch to clean-inode" is the one I already did from sct? Or are we
talking about another issue?

Yes. Make it so. In the meantime, does everybody agree that pre5 fixes the
bugs, even though it still has these discussion items left?
