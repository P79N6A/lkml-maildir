Hi,
I made patches to unify crash_32/64.c.
There are three patches;
1. add lapic_shutdown for x86_64
2. add safe_smp_processor_id for x86_64
3. unify crash_32/64.c
I'm not sure that it's good to split to these patches.
I've compiled on both of 32bit and 64bit, and tested
kdump on 64bit.
Thanks
Hiroshi Shimamoto
