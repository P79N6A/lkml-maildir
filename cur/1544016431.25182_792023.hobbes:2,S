Hey, somebody actually reads that stuff!  I guess I'll need to be 
careful what I write from now on :)
Hi Justin, on a more serious note, if you are having problems with 
labeled networking it's probably a good idea to CC the SELinux, LSM 
and/or netdev lists depending on the issue as I often miss mail if it 
is only posted to LKML.  When in doubt you can just CC me personally 
(paul.moore@hp.com) and I'll add whatever list seems appropriate.

Good, that is how it should work give the configuration shown above.

That is just plain odd, there isn't really anything that is driver 
specific.  Can you share any more details like kernel version, 
netlabel_tools verion, distro, etc?  I don't have any ath9k hardware 
lying around to test so I would appreciate whatever additional 
information you can provide.
