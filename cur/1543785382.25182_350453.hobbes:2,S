No No. The solution is to do it right. If the standard says that
the header file can't include a header file defining the types used
within that header file (and I don't think the "standard" says that
at all), then the correct solution is to include the correct header file
in the user program. It is truly just that simple.
The whole purpose of POSIX types, a.k.a. ISO C99: 7.18 Integer types,
<stdint.h> was to PREVENT the crap like you describe. We do NOT
need, for instance....
 	uint8, u8, u8_t, __u8, _u8, -> inf., to
correctly define an unsigned 8-bit char type. All we need is the
POSIX type, uint8_t, nothing else.
