Subject: [PATCH 001 of 3] md: Don't clear bits in bitmap when writing to one device fails during recovery.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/30/17

Currently a device failure during recovery leaves bits set in the
bitmap.  This normally isn't a problem as the offending device will be
rejected because of errors.  However if device re-adding is being used
with non-persistent bitmaps, this can be a problem.
