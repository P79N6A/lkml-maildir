Please do look at the latest patches (always at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/agk/patches/2.6/editing/series.html
 )
where you'll see I've already disentangled the mess of functions
and given them more understandable names, so at least following the program
flow is easier.
Read and write do the ref counting differently (but correctly AFAICT) - I want
that changing, but held back from doing it without first checking whether the
later patches (not yet reviewed) provide a reason to prefer one method
over the other.
