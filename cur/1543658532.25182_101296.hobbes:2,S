Richard,
The last time I tried installing the GNU Operating System without the
Linux Kernel, it wouldn't boot. Dont know why. I had my /bin/ls and my
/bin/make installed but they just wouldn't boot the computer.
I finally installed a Windows 98 kernel to help the GNU operating system
(i.e. ls and make) and now I can happily state that my computer is
running a GNU Operating System with a Windows 98 kernel.
Doesn't that sound silly ???????
Know why ? cos (Operating System == kernel), in this case, its Linux,
and the GNU stuff refers to the utilities only.
Mind you, they are VERY IMPORTANT utilities, but utilities nonetheless.
To call them an operating system is ridiculous, as I think I proved in
the earlier part of my mail.
