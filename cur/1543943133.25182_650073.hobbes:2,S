Linus -- as there are no other pending objections to the code so far, and 
I think we agreed that this has nothing to do neither with wireless tree, 
nor with networking drivers in general (it is basically a PCMCIA serial 
driver, and thus there is no relevant maintainer alive), would you please 
consider merging it for 2.6.25?
David, thanks a lot for taking care of another respin.
Thanks,
