My point exactly. You seem to excuse them for providing broken patches
because they use the wrong tools to do the job in the first place, I
don't (and I'm not even you). If CVS doesn't work, let's not use it.
There are other tools out there which will do the job just fine (one of
them being quilt [1], which makes my own job so much easier since I'm
using it, thanks to its various authors and contributors).
