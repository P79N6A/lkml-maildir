The problem is that the card has never been rendered unusable, it just
starts to have performance issues.
I've compiled the new driver and installed it. I'll schedule a reboot later
this week to get it working.
I've also built 2.6.14.3, which was activeted by a reboot this Saturday.
I'll let you know if the new driver worked.
>do you have a test to reproduce this?
Yes, let the server act as usual, it just starts happening out of the blue.
No new hardware has been added or removed, no new programs has been
installed.
Only thing upgrades was the kernel.
