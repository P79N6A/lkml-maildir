Yes, this is true. The core code in both cases originates from my and
Dirks work.
I'd just like to get something pushed up to mainline so that work can
begin on expanding the number of chips supported.
This would include the ASICs found in many iPAQ PDAs (their MMC module
seems to be an IRQ-less TMIO chip).
I havent submitted the subdevice drivers yet, only the base/core
drivers.
The OE versions probably have better USB and video subdevice support
(which I shall evaluate as I go on), wheras the NAND flash and MMC
drivers in hh.org are probably more up to date (I run root on SD usinf
the hh.org tmio_mmc driver on all three of the MFD chips in this patch
series on a daily basis).
merging the best of these patch series is my goal and it shouldnt be too
hard.
