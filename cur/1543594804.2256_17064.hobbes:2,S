Well, that ought to make Intel happy.  The price of a new desktop box around 
these parts has dropped to about $250, and that comes preassembled.  $25 for 
ram, $80 hard drive, $40 processor in ~$30 motherboard, and the floppy, case, 
power supply, and keyboard are all a rounding error.  The monitor's still 
expensive, but those are recycled from system to system and you can get a 17 
inch for $99 from goodwill computers.
So how exactly DOES MS expect to stop the Linux folks from reverse 
engineering .NET apps?  Patents?  Giving up on the client side and moving to 
an ASP business model (toe to toe with AOL)?  Constant gratuitous 
compatability changes to try to prevent all those nasty GPL viruses from 
evolving an immunity to their new proprietary drug?  (Without, of course, 
being obvious enough to trigger a third antitrust trial after the 1995 and 
1998 ones...)
Just curious...
