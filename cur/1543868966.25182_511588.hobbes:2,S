It was related some code under a hot plug ifdef ..
Here's the final commit from the bisect which caused it . It says "No
changes to existing functionality" ?

    [PATCH] clockevents: i386 drivers
    Add clockevent drivers for i386: lapic (local) and PIT/HPET (global).  Update
    the timer IRQ to call into the PIT/HPET driver's event handler and the
    lapic-timer IRQ to call into the lapic clockevent driver.  The assignement of
    timer functionality is delegated to the core framework code and replaces the
    compile and runtime evalution in do_timer_interrupt_hook()
    Use the clockevents broadcast support and implement the lapic_broadcast
    function for ACPI.
    No changes to existing functionality.
