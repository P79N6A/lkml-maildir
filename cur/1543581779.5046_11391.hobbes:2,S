Michel, FYI, PCI GART is a feature of the video chipset, not the host
bridge, and so is not directly related to the kernel (there's no generic
PCI GART driver like there is an AGP GART driver). AFAIK, the only PCI
GART implementation so far is for rage 128 (or derived, like the M3), and
is available in the "ati-pcigart-0-0-1-branch" DRI CVS branch. You need
to compile the DRM inside this X server version, not the kernel one.
