Whole thread can be read from the following URL.
  
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ide/21710
In a nutshell, with ADMA enabled, FLUSH_EXT occasionally times out.  I
first suspected faulty disk (reallocation failure on flush) but SMART
reports nothing suspicious and w/ ADMA disabled, the drive works just fine.
On a side note, on 2.6.22.1, SMART fails from time to time but the
problem went away on 2.6.24-rc6.  This was apparently fixed during that
period.  I guess we can ignore this for now.
Thanks.
