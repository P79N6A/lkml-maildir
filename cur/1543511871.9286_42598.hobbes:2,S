Actually I don't have a UHCI I have a OHCI. hmmm I compile support for
all three
because I didn't have the card information handy. I guess the next
question to ask
is the UHCI an intel cpu only part ?
This Intel only stuff will get real confusing soon becuase the next wave
of Alpha boards
will be close to the wave of AMD boards. As per the Alpha board will
have an AGP slot on it.
