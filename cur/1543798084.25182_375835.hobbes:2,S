FYI, the 6.1.6 version of PlugSched for 2.6.15-rc5-mm2 that I announced 
yesterday applies the same SCHED_BATCH semantics as Ingo's patch to the 
ingosched, nicksched, zaphod and spa_ws schedulers (i.e. it suppresses 
interactive bonuses for tasks in the SCHED_BATCH policy class).  As 
spa_no_frills and spa_svr do not have interactive bonuses there is no 
change to their semantics.  The staircase scheduler in PlugSched will be 
updated to the same SCHED_BATCH as the stand alone version in due course.
