You should #include <linux/highmem.h> in those drivers .c files, then it
will compile, but that's not the right fix, you'd need to add the
pte_kunmap too or it would deadlock with highmem. The right fix is to
convert those drivers to vmalloc_to_page, then they will work flawlessy.
Alan actually has a patch in his -ac that converted most usb and other
drivers to vmalloc_to_page, I will merge it plus I will convert those
below drivers if they're not just covered by Alan's patch. Alan could
you push it to Marcelo?
After I finished covering all the compilation failures you reported I
will upload an aa2 with all your patches included. I usually don't
compile every driver out there so I didn't noticed those problems, sorry.

actually comx is unrealted to the pte-highmem problem, to fix it we
should EXPORT_SYMBOL(proc_get_inode), but I'm not sure why it wants to
implement the dir lookup by itself instead of relying on the procfs
layer, probably to allow more functionality like mkdir/rmdir.
