Doh! Sorry for my confusion, I guess I wasn't reading your posting too 
carefully. I understand the software architecture part now. Nevertheless 
one day or another you will need to face the caching issue too unless 
your data structure will always fit entirely into the cache or am I 
completely off track again?

Fair enough. I'm looking forward to seeing this framework. Any release 
schedules or rough plans?

Yes, we're doing tests in this field now (as with evlog) but as it seems 
from preliminary testing netlink transportation of binary data is not 
100% reliable either. However, I will refrain from further posting 
assumptions until we've done our tests and until we can post useful 
results and facts in this field.
Thanks and cheers,
