I was referring here to the 16MB/CPU you proposed originally which will not fit 
into _any_  kernel area for 16k CPUs. 
The whole mapping for all CPUs cannot fit into 2GB of course, but the reference 
linker managed range can.

Sure it can -- you just get the base address from a global array
and then add the offset

Anyways i think your current scheme cannot work (too much VM, placed at the wrong 
place; some wrong assumptions).
But since I seem unable to communicate this to you I'll stop commenting
and let you find it out the hard way. Have fun.
