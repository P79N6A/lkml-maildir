FWIW, the code that ATADRVR (
http://www.ata-atapi.com/
) uses to issue 
commands does something like
	write Command register to start command
	if (device == ATAPI)			# i.e. not ATA
		delay(150 msec)
	pound Status / AltStatus, kick DMA engine, whatever else
ATADRVR is open code (for an MS-DOS-level driver), and really worth a 
read.  Between ATADRVR and drivers/ide, you get a pretty good idea about 
what __field experience__ has shown is needed for ATAPI devices.
