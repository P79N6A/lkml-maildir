I wasn't aware of that, thanks for the information.
I think this means we'll probably need to add a tunable, similar to image_size,
that will allow the users to specify how much spare memory they want to reserve
for suspending (instead of the constant PAGES_FOR_IO).  IMO we can call it
'spare_memory'.
Still, this doesn't look like a real solution, because it would require the
users affected by this problem to experiment with suspending in order to
figure out how much spare memory they will need.
IMO to really fix the problem, we should let the drivers that need much memory
for suspending allocate it _before_ the memory shrinker is called.  For this
purpose we can use notifiers that will be called before we start the shrinking
of memory.  Namely, if a driver needs to allocate substantial amount of memory
for suspending, it can register a notifier that will be called before we try to
shrink memory.  Then, the memory needed by the driver may be allocated in
this notifier (of course, in that case it will also have to be called if the
shrinking of memory fails, so that the memory allocated by the driver for
suspending can be freed) and used in the driver's .suspend() routine.
Comments welcome.
