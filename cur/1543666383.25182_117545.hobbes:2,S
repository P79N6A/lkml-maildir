In both cases hand fixup is needed. The "overlapping patch" partial order
is a (small, or even very small) subset of the "depends on" partial order
which you really want. It would be nice to be able to get a much better
approximation than "conflicting patch" automatically, but I fail to see
how. Giving dependencies by hand is a possibility, but it will most of the
time give as bad an approximation as the above (Do you really know _all_
patches on which your latest and greatest depends? Some (or even most) of
them will be old patches, that by now will be just part of the general
landscape. And this can happen even with direct dependencies: Think of
"disabling IRQs doesn't ensure mutual exclusion" or some such pervasive
change that will affect a small part of any patch, and now move an old 
patch forward...).
