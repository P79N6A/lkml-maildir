Subject: [PATCH] improved locking performance in rt_run_flush()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/12/132

While testing adding/deleting large numbers of interfaces, I found
rt_run_flush() was the #1 cpu user in a kernel profile by far.
The below patch changes rt_run_flush() to only take each spinlock
protecting the rt_hash_table once instead of taking a spinlock for
every hash table bucket (and ending up taking the same small set 
of locks over and over).
Deleting 256 interfaces on a 4-way SMP system with 16K buckets reduced
overall cpu-time more than 50% and reduced wall-time about 33%.  I
suspect systems with large amounts of memory (and more buckets) will
see an even greater benefit.
Note there is a small change in that rt_free() is called while the
lock is held where before it was called without the lock held.  I
don't think this should be an issue.
