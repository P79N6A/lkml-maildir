This patch makes pxamci stop working for me on a HTC Magician (PXA272).
Switching from 2.6.18 to 2.6.19-rc1 I got a kernel panic:
mmc0: clock 0Hz busmode 1 powermode 0 cs 0  Vdd 0 width 0
PXAMCI: clkrt = 0 cmdat = 0
VFS: Cannot open root device "mmcblk0p2" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
After removing this patch from 2.6.19-rc1, everything is working again.
Are there any changes to pxamci.c needed to be compatible with it?
regards
Philipp
