OTOH, adding post-install in /etc/conf.modules has to be done by every
user - manually.  What's the betting that 75% will not read the docs,
15% will ignore the line that says "update conf.modules" and 2% will
make a typing error (pick your own numbers).  You risk getting bug
reports against USB from people who do not RTFM.
I want to reserve conf.modules entries for machine specific entries and
optional user data, not for stuff that is always required for a
particular subsystem.  If usb-uhci is always required, have the kernel
load it.
If you do not want extra kernel code, have usb-uhci export a dummy
symbol and have the other modules reference that symbol.  Then the
module dependency will take care of it automatically.
