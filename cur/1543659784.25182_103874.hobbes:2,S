It's taking me a while to catch up with the contest code rewrite. A quick 
perusal of the results shows a couple of dud runs in the .56 and .57 dbench 
results, so no. Should have audited them first. Here's a corrected set with 
the dud results removed:
dbench_load:
Kernel     [runs]       Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.54          3       118     66.1    3       24.6    1.49
2.5.55          3       117     68.4    2       16.2    1.50
2.5.56          2       124     62.9    3       25.8    1.57
2.5.57          3       121     64.5    3       22.3    1.53
2.5.58          3       122     64.8    3       24.6    1.54
No change there sorry.

Yes that fixes it.
