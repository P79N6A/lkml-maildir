Always useful to compare. I think the data from STP show something simular.
I've pulled some reports, rather than send a huge email, here are the URL's
(btw STP runs v4.0.1 UNIXbench) 
 runs made on 2-CPU platform
2.4.19: 
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/3877/results/report
2.5.33: 
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/4928/results/report
Another compare...why does pre5 appear a little worse than pre4 ?
2.4.20-pre5: 
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/4836/results/report
2.4.20-pre4: 
http://khack.osdl.org/stp/4581/results/report
