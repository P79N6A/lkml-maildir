Darn, I was hoping to avoid system calls.
Perhaps it's good fortune that futexes just arrived :-)
In some ways, it seems entirely reasonable for truncate() to behave as
if it were writing zeros.  That is, after all, what you see there if the
file is expanded later with a hole.
I wonder if it is reasonable to depend on that: -- i.e. I'll only ever
see zeros, not say random bytes, or ones or something.  I'm sure that's
so with the current kernel, and probably all of them ever (except for
bugs) but I wonder whether it's ok to rely on that.
