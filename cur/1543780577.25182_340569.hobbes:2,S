Perhaps both?
I'm novice here, but if i'm reading the man page correctly, it says:
SA_NODEFER
   Do not prevent the signal from being received from within
   its  own  signal handler. 
	(they also imply that SA_NOMASK is the old name for this,
	which might make it clear what it's use is).
In which case blocking (masking) when it's not set is exactly what it's
supposed to do.
