All updated metadata is always by O_SYNC/fsync, with the _only_
exception of the timestamps.  Strictly, even timestamp flush is required
by POSIX, but it's just too slow in most cases.  In POSIX, O_DATASYNC
and fdatasync() are explicitly allowed to omit the timestamp updates if
that is the only dirty metadata involved.

We have to, there's no choice about metadata in general.  timestamps are
a special case where it is legitimate to consider relaxing the flush
rule for the fdatasync variants, or even for fsync if specified by a
sysctl parameter (which is what at least one other Unix does).
