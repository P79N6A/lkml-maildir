That is undesirable for READA.

Linux 2.4 tends to contain costly confusion between writeout for memory
cleansing and writeout for data integrity.
In 2.5 I have been trying to make it very clear and explicit that these are
fundamentally different things.

That'd probably be OK, with a dont-do-that for READA.

Yup.  Except for a non-uptodate buffer.  If software is bringing a
non-uptodate buffer uptodate by hand it should generally be locked, else a
concurrent read may stomp on the changes.  There are few places where this
happens.
