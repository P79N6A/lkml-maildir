I know you've seen those work at home programs before, but this one is for real!  Selling coffee recipe downloads for $1 each on an affiliate website and you keep all the money!  They charge 32.95 for the website for life & give you a refund after you earn $150.00.  I signed up & got the refund in 4 days, check it out!
