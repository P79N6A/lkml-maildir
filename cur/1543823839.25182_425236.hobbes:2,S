I haven't checked all the docs and codes thoroughly but I don't see a 
need for new protocol or anything.  When a streaming command fails due 
to failing to meet timing constraints, it fails w/ device error.  sg can 
adjust retry count and the device error will be reported without much 
recovery action (only revalidation).  If the device fails due to some 
other reasons (say HSM violation), it needs full EH no matter what. 
Without full EH, it becomes completely unusable.

All I can see are little extensions to sg interface and maybe libata.  I 
don't think it needs full-blown in-kernel driver.  However, to use this 
feature with a filesystem, we would need to build a block map of the 
file to use.  I think such feature is already provided and used by 
LILO/GRUB kinds of things.
