At least the PPC people are eating the overhead because back when they
didn't they had a long string of subtle powerpc only bugs caused by that
It's a stability/maintainability vs performance issue. I doubt the 
performance advantage would be worth the additional work. I guess
with the engineering time you would need to spend getting all this right
you could do much more fruitful optimizations.
