Check also vm_area_struct - that's what memory contexts consist of
(user memory consists of objects that correspond to areas; pagein,
pageout, etc. are methods of these objects; mmap() and friends
create/manipulate/destroy them). File mappings (both shared and
private) are derived classes, ditto for attached shm segment, etc.
