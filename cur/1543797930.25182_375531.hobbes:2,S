Even if this is the case it is the decision of the hardware vendor to go
that way. The underlying organzation may be equally guilty but that
doens't make the hardware vendor innocent - simply he plays the same
game just with an excuse.

Then it is up to them to do something.

s/copyright/patent/ then you will get it probably more right.
Given (beautiful and readable) source code, a patent infringement is
probably much easier to proove than with disassembled output of gcc-4.x.

Propriatory vendors (the larger they are, the more it makes sense) do
that all the time without telling their customers/users (usually
somewhere hidden within some tools which produce not compliant garbage)
and the strategy is called "customer lockin".

At least for (certified) ISDN stacks any change on the source (including
trivial bug fixes) invalidates any official certification AFAIK.
