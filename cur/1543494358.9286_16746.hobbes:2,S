Start thinking about them.  2.2.7_andrea3 seems to perform similarly to
2.2.6_andrea2:
test 1 - boot, login & run dbase on a file.
test 2 - boot, login, startx, run dbase on a file, bring up netscape,
         edit in emacs, etc.
dbase program builds a gdbm database.  See previous msgs for details.
                  Test 1 (noninteractive)              Test 2 (interactive)

Looks good.  I'm not sure interactive performance was quite as good as
2.2.6a2, but it might just be my imagination - it's hard to say at
this point which one is better interactively.  Has anyone else been
doing any tests?
