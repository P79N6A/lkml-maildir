I might be missing something here, but it works fine over here
with 2.6.7-bk21 which seems to include the cset:
---
 $ uname -r
2.6.7-bk21

Usage: java [-options] class [args...]
           (to execute a class)
   or  java -jar [-options] jarfile [args...]
           (to execute a jar file)
where options include:
    -client       to select the "client" VM
    -server       to select the "server" VM
    -hotspot      is a synonym for the "client" VM  [deprecated]
