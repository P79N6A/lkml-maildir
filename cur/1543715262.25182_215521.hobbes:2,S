Can you give a bit more detail?  How much data is there?  "many many"
gigabytes can mean a lot.  You say you use DVDs for recovery, but at
~5GB/DVD, that's a LOT of DVDs to store a 5 drive array, especially
since you're talking about 300GB IDE drives.
Can you just use RAID0 then on your backup interval, break the mirror
and store the mirror in the closet, replacing that half of the mirror
with fresh drives?
In theory SATA will support hotplugging and already supports long
cables, so that might be a better solution than external USB
enclosures.
