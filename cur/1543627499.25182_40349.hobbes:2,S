Hey again, Martin :)
What do you think about the following :
--- clean-linux-2.5.8/drivers/ide/ide.c Sun Apr 14 21:18:52 2002
+++ patched-linux-2.5.8/drivers/ide/ide.c       Mon Apr 15 14:09:18 2002
@@ -3120,7 +3120,7 @@
        /*
         * Look for bus speed option:  "idebus="
         */
-       if (strncmp(s, "idebus", 6)) {
+       if (strncmp(s, "idebus", 6) == 0) {
                if (match_parm(&s[6], NULL, vals, 1) != 1)
                        goto bad_option;
                if (vals[0] >= 20 && vals[0] <= 66) {
gives :
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=2.5.8-without-TCQ ro root=303 video=matrox:vesa:0x118 idebus=66 profile=2
ide_setup: idebus=66
ide: system bus speed 66MHz
works like a charm :)
