Hrm, I just updated to -rc5.  Interrupts being handled by the IOAPIC
don't suffer from this problem, but MSI interrupts are still affected.
I added a few printks to the kernel to figure out what IRQ affinity
masks were being passed around and saw this:
[  256.298773] Breaking affinity for irq 4341
[  256.298774] irq=4341 affinity=2 mask=d
<call to set_affinity>
[  256.298787] irq=4341 affinity=d
<ethernet on irq 4341 stops working>
I'll keep digging, but at least it appears that the problem has been
shrunk down to something the MSI code.
