I did the tests. I confirm Andi's conclusion that
if you are going to use cleared/copied page immediately,
nt stores are a loss.

My kernel compiles took ~5000000 page clears and ~300000 page copies.
slow (rep stosd/rep movsd), three runs:
real    12m47.530s
user    11m24.523s
sys     1m17.868s
real    12m45.362s
user    11m24.708s
sys     1m18.286s
real    12m45.152s
user    11m25.030s
sys     1m17.985s
mmx_APn/APN (mmx page clear, mmx page copy with nt stores):
real    12m41.737s
user    11m26.104s
sys     1m12.126s
real    12m40.753s
user    11m26.512s
sys     1m11.185s
mmx_APN  (mmx page clear with nt stores, mmx page copy with nt stores):
real    12m37.913s
user    11m30.376s
sys     1m4.622s
My kernel compiles on Athlon 2000 MHz were faster too.
