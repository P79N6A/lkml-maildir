Except, as I discovered recently in playing around with the scheduler,
if you modify sched.h, you basically have to recompile the entire
kernel, as it seems everything depends on it.
On that note, why is add_to_runqueue() in sched.c and
del_from_runqueue() in sched.h?  del_from_runqueue being the only func I
was modifying in sched.h (really annoying have to recompile an entire
kernel multiple times in a vmware vm, albiet thats not a good reason to
move it, I'm just wondering why they are split in 2 different files)
thanks,
