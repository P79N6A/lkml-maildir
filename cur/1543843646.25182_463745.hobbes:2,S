Greg, Andrew,
I'd really like to rework this patch in a different direction.  As
such, please drop the patch:
gregkh-pci-pci-sort-device-lists-breadth-first.patch
from your trees, and I'll provide a new one next week.
Breadth-first vs depth-first is really only part of the problem.  More
fundamental is the expectation that embedded devices get discovered
before add-in devices in physical slots.  From there, breadth-first vs
depth-first is interesting again.  I'd like to sort the list to put
the embedded devices first, subsort those breadth-first, then list the
add-in devices in ascending slot number order, subsort breadth-first.
I'll default this sorting routine off, enabled/disabled via a command
line option, and enabled by default for some systems based on DMI
strings.
arch/i386/pci/irq.c already has the PCI IRQ Routing Table available,
from which we can get embedded vs slotN information.  It's not
currently being used in this manner, so I'm massaging that.
How does this sound?
Thanks,
Matt
