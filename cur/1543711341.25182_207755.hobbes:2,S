No I'm not sure actually, it could be just read lock
contention. IIRC it was all coming from the semaphore's
spinlock, in up_read...

That would be interesting, yes. I have (somewhere) a patch
that wakes up the semaphore's waiters outside its spinlock.
I think that only gave about 5% or so improvement though.
