I'm using my own method:
1. Every kernel has got entry in lilo.conf.
2. Every module directories, System.maps and kernel images has got standard names constructed from lines 'label' at lilo.conf. (like: System.map-speed_hack if image's name is speed_hack).
3. I'm using a shell script from rcS.d which symlinks these files/directory according /proc/cmdline which holds the name of loaded image as well.
So this can be solve without any kernel source modification. Maybe this
technique should be part of distributions ?
