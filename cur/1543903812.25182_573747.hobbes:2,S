x86_64 defconfig
rm vmlinux*; time make vmlinux
Vanilla tree: ~7,7 sec
With single shot ld (Roland's patch): 8,3 secs
So as expected slower. As we link twice the cost is ~0,3 sec 
for a x86_64 defconfig link on my box.
So it should be beneficial to do it and Alan's link did not really
convince me for the kernel usage.
Al - do you have any input there?
