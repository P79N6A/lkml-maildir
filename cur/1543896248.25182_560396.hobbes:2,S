Totally agree.

Well the description for DEBUG_RODATA is:
         Mark the kernel read-only data as write-protected in the pagetables,
         in order to catch accidental (and incorrect) writes to such const data.
What we are doing with kprobes is neither accidental, nor incorrect.

I understand your philosophical viewpoint here. Anyway it's no biggie
as can keep the patch out of tree if I want it... Another option is to
be able to enable and disable protecting read only data via a sysctl
but that seems even uglier.
Anyway I'll stop wasting your time now.
