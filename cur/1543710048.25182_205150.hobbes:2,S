Subject: [PATCH] set request fastfail bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The first three bio and request flags are no longer identical.
The bio barrier and rw flags are getting set in __make_request
and get_request respectively, and failfast is getting
left out. The attached patch (built against 2.6.4-rc3)
sets the request's failfast flag in __make_request when the bio's
flag is set.
