Yes, it's weird, but it happened the first time I tried the test5 kernel. 
Not a good feeling, sitting with directories you can't even delete :\ The 
computer had been up for some time (12 hours or so), and several files I 
had open for editing were zeroed out when I opened them after reboot. 
Could it have to do with my Maxtor DiamondMax drive perhaps? I guess most 
people got Seagate SATA drives, I've since then purchased a Seagate 7200.7 
SATA to complement the Maxtor.

Sounds great, I think I will migrate to a newer kernel once I have done 
some proper backups to an unmounted partition :]
