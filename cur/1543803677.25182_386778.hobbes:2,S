Hi,
since it is usually what I touch last, I now tried an BIOS update which solved 
the IRQ routing oddities:
old version:  V3.20 06/27/05
new version: V4.30 10/01/06
The 2x timer sped can be circumvented with: disable_timer_pin_1
However then, with APIC interrupts used, the machine does not come back 
properly after suspend, it hangs on resume. I can post the debug output of 
that if someone is interested.
