Woah... I think you are going off the deep end here.  This sounds just
too complicated.
1/ If you wanted to do autodetect "right", you would make it look a
   lot like partition detection (split md into two bits. A partition
   detection personality that registers the component devices
   somewhere, and the main raid module that gets autoloaded when you
   try to actually access a raid device).
2/ Partition detection *should* be done in user-space.  So should
   autodetect. mdadm does that for you..
