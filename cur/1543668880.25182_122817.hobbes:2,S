Hi,
I'm just curious, is there any reason why the VFS-lock patch provided by the
LVM people has not been included into the 2.4.x tree yet?
If I were to apply this patch to a stock 2.4.20 kernel, is it safe to use
LVM snapshots with ReiserFS on production machines, or are there any
stability issues with it (either with the LVM version that comes with
2.4.20, or upgrading to LVM 1.0.7)?
Thanks,
Alex
