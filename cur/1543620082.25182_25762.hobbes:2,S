I got mine from the company I bought the drive from. They are official IBM 
dealers (or something). The url for the firmware they offer is:
http://www.scan.co.uk/ibmhddtest.htm
They also have the DTLA firmware so you can grab it from there. Note that 
you need a computer running windows in order to create the floppy with the 
firmware. - Once you have the floppy boot the computer containing the hd 
you want to upgrade with the floppy and follow the onscreen instructions.
btw. During the upgrade the drives make strange noises and that had me 
worried the first time round but it seems to always happen during upgrades 
so is probably normal. I upgraded both DTLA and GXP drives and both work fine.
