Looking at the code, both these lines of code are inside a loop which
may run for quite a while if clocksource_read(clock) returns
non-monotonic values:
        offset = (clocksource_read(clock) - clock->cycle_last) & clock->mask;
	[...]
        while (offset >= clock->cycle_interval) {
                /* accumulate one interval */
                offset -= clock->cycle_interval;
	[...]
	}
As I observed such behaviour only when the host has frequency scaling
activated: Could it be that in this case, clocksource_read(clock) on the
guest is misbehaving?
