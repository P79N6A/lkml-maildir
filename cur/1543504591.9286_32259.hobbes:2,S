Agreed, but:
a) Quake probably use mmap() + select() to output sound, and therefore
in terms of pratical latency, there are little benefits over the write() method
 , when the system is under high load (especially disk I/O)
(I don't think that Quake uses the busywaiting mmap() hack)
Mingo's patches are looking very promising, it's just wonderful to see these
sub-1ms scheduling jitters , even if there are still very sporadic 20ms peaks,
I'm confident that this can be solved easily.
Consider that if you run a game at 50fps you can use a latency of 20ms
and with mingo's modifications, we will get reliable 20ms latency even
on an old box, but running Quake on an old 486 isn't too fun.  :-)
mmap() lowlatency advandages will only be relevant on SMP boxes where you
can use DSP-like busywait loops, but you don't need 1ms audio latency for
games :-), 20ms is more than adequate, just because you don't want to
head the explosion before she appears on the screen. :-)

Agreed, write() has the nice advantage of software mixing, re-routing
to other audio-apps or audio-outputs etc ..
Yes, you can archieve these things with mmap() too, but then you will
loose the advantages, since you need intermediate buffers for mixing
or re-routing.

Yes, I think just because most of the latency problems are scheduling-latency
problems.
If write() can do it , than an additional layer using mmap() can archieve
the same goal, perhaps using a little more CPU on non mmap()-able soundcards,
(maybe I could be wrong about the CPU usage).

What about the folks which use the commercial OSS on a pro-soundcard
which doesn't support mmap(), which want to play Quake.
They can't because mmap() is not supported on these cards, actually
not even through an emulation layer.

I think, changing fragment sizes or samplerates is not a big obstacle
to software mixing, it could only be a bit slower due to the resampling
involved.

Hmm, the "bye bye 2.3" worries me a quite a bit,
I'd prefer an ALSA version with less features in 2.4 (and therefore in 2.3),
over a more feature rich version in 2.6.
A feature freeze for kernel 2.4 would be a good thing(TM).
opinions ?

Benno.
