Hi,
When I compiled and booted 2.4.5, the machine got stuck in
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
(SysRq still worked, ^C did not seem to).
I tried to strace it. Last thing strace managed to write was:
ioctl(4, 0x8914
(no comma, not including the trird argument). I tried to switch of some
compile-time parameters I changed from 2.4.4, but problem persisted.
After reversing 2.4.5 patch and recompiling the kernel (using exactly the
same config), the problem dispaeared.
I include the .config used. I'll try to gen any aother information you might
consider some use, but currently have no idea what it might be.
