  Consider that the behavior itself of using the new motherboard, SB600,
means a lot of change, so even if the user still use IDE driver, he also
a need verification process.

  But the SB600 SATA controller is really an AHCI controller. And that
will lose high performance (and cannot use NCQ).

  No, even if there would be a open source RAID driver, it still could
no run.

  The case of Jmicron is not the same as ours. They use different pci
functions in the SATA controller.

  OK, I am rewriting the patch based on the following considerations:
  1. move these code to ahci driver, and add new code to PATA driver.
  2. add new options to kernel configuration, and users can choose IDE
driver or AHCI driver to support SB600 SATA when it is in IDE mode.
