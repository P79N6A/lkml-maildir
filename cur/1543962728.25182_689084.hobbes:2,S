If you followed my description then you would see
that the visibility of C are determineded by the dependencies
of C (none in this case) and the dependencies of the symbol
it requires. In this case B. B dpens on A and A equals m so B is
visible thus C is visible.

Lets try to agree on the semantics with bools first please.
When we have that in place lets extend it to modular - OK?
