Pretty sure it is correct. I'm usually wrong though :P
It decremented lo_pending because it had previously incremented it.
We do away with that and do that under a single critical section,
with the increment done _after_ all error checking. So...

Don't I guess, no. If it reaches zero at any stage then that's
where it should stay. So I think you can just read lo_pending.
