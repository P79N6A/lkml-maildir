Sure, I'm not claiming it's an IDE bug (please re-read the paragraph)
and my recent even said out loud that this could be a bug anywhere. It
also stresses that this bug can be quite serious and cause data
corruption, since this sort of thing is not expected to happen.
I'm suggesting that this is _most likely_ a bug introduced in the recent
pcidma changes. Or it could be a bug with a request getting screwed over
somewhere. Nasty corruption likely in that case as well.
