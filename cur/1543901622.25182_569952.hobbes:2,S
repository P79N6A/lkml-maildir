Thanks Casey,
I plan to pass simple lines of policy from user-space into kernel 
functions which use this information to build the internal 
representation of policy.
I had started writing these functions in user-space (to save time :\) 
and stupidly did not check that strtok_r was available from within the 
kernel (I thought string.h would include it). Anyway, so now I have a 
rewrite on my hands (unless I just include the strtok_r code). All part 
of the learning process I guess.

Will do.

It is not a lot in comparison to SELinux.
Thanks,
Cliffe.
