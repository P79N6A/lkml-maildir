The patch I sent in this thread does not do any baling out,
it only skips zones where the number of free pages is more
than 4 times zone->pages_high.
Equal pressure is still applied to the other zones.
This should not be a problem since we do not enter direct
reclaim unless the free pages in every zone in our zonelist
are below zone->pages_low.
Zone skipping is only done by tasks that have been in the
direct reclaim code for a long time.
