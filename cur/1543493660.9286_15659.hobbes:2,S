I'm having problems with forwarding packets with kernel 2.2.4.
IP masquerade used to work in my Red Hat 5.2 kernel 2.0.36 system
but since I've upraded to kernel 2.2.4, it stopped working. I've checked
the network configuration options many times and don't think I left
out any required options. Anyone managed to get IP maquerade to work with
kernel 2.2.4? Any help would be appreciated.
Regards,
Anthony.
