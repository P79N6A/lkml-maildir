I keep getting these messages all the time in my logs whenever I do
operations like ftp/telnet/browsing/email.

What does this means? And what usually is the cause of this problem? Any

I've done a search for this problem in AltaVista and one of the
possibilities mentioned was that there was a bug like this in 2.1.32.
