Thanks for investing time on the logic analyser, Dani.  My experience
is slightly different.
I have several mainboards (Tyan S1867) with older chipsets from
ServerWorks (f.k.a. Reliance).  The IDE controller (OSB4 rev 0) is used
daily with ATAPI CDRW drives in UDMA(33) Mode.  System handles read/write
errors without problem.
The system will lock solid when both IDE channels are accessed,
and either one is using DMA.  Since I want DMA, I simply abandon the
secondary channel.
I have spare machines available for quack medical experiments.
