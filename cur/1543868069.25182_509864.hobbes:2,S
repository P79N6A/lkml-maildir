I'm not arguing "write a Linux module" is a functional idea. But "write code
so that a graphics card with a X1950 chipset works with a Linux kernel"
certainly is.
Again, see Lexmark v. Static Controls. If "make a toner cartridge that works
with a particular Lexmark printer" is a functional idea, why is "make a
graphics driver that works with a particular Linux kernel" not? What is the
difference you think matters?
