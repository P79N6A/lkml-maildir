At the SAS BOF, I indicated that it would not be much trouble to
translate the CSMI handler in the aacraid driver to a similar sysfs
arrangement. If such info can be mined from a firmware based RAID card,
every driver should be able to do so. The spec writers really need to
consider rewriting SDI for sysfs (if they have not already) and move
away from an ABI.

I think that read/write from a char device is going away too.
For this reason I showed the whole picture of the SAS
domain in sysfs _and_ created a binary file attr to send/receive SMP
requests/responses to control the domain and get attributes
("smp_portal" binary attr of each expander).
It is completely user space driven and a user space library
is simple to write.
See drivers/scsi/sas/expander_conf.c which is a user
space utility.  For the output see Announcement 3:
http://linux.adaptec.com/sas/Announce_2.txt
 or here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112629509318354&w=2
The code which implements it is very tiny, at the bottom
of drivers/scsi/sas/sas_expander.c
