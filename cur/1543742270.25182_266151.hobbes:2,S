Some of them have pictures (Fn-Esc for suspend to ram, Fn-F12 for
suspend to disk, Fn-F3 for mute, Fn-F4 for launching the volume
controls, Fn-F5 for launching the brightness controls, Fn-F7/F8 for
changing from LCD to external monitor or TV). All the others have
no pictures on them.

This sound like policy to me and should not be done into the
kernel but somewhere you can configure it, like in a keyboard 
keymap or something like that.
