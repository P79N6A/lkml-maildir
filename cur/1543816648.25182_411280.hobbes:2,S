It should be trivial to reproduce by other people. Biggest workload
is kernel compiles and quilt.
After a few hours with -git12 it's already at
dentry_cache      947013 952014    208   19    1 : tunables  120   60    8 : slabdata  50100  50106    480
and starting to go into swap.
I can't imagine I'm the only one seeing this?
I have a few x86-64 patches applied too, but they don't change anything
in this area.
