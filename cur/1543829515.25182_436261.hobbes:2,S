gfs2_repermission doesn't exist in the latest git tree. I had spotted
that one earlier and replaced it with direct calls to permission.
vfs_permission is just a wrapper for permission.
file_permission which you are advocating using has the comment:
/**
 * file_permission  -  check for additional access rights to a given file
 * @file:       file to check access rights for
 * @mask:       right to check for (%MAY_READ, %MAY_WRITE, %MAY_EXEC)
 *
 * Used to check for read/write/execute permissions on an already opened
 * file.
 *
 * Note:
 *      Do not use this function in new code.  All access checks should
 *      be done using vfs_permission().
 */
so I guess thats not the right thing. I'm afraid I fail to see whats wrong
with just calling permission directly... we need to call it mainly because
the VFS only does locking within a single node and we recheck the permissions
in a few places after we've taken the glocks which provide cluster-wide
exclusion.
