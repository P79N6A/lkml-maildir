I like the patch, after adding some casts to the printf args it
compiles fine. However you print warnings each time a resource has been
reserved... without checking if it hasn't been reserved by ACPI itself!
My machine looks like this:
1000-107f : 0000:00:1f.0
  1000-1003 : ACPI PM1a_EVT_BLK
  1004-1005 : ACPI PM1a_CNT_BLK
  1008-100b : ACPI PM_TMR
  1010-1015 : ACPI CPU throttle
  1020-1020 : ACPI PM2_CNT_BLK
  1028-102b : ACPI GPE0_BLK
  102c-102f : ACPI GPE1_BLK
Given that these ports were reserved by ACPI it is perfectly legitimate
that ACPI accesses it, so we must not print a warning in this case. We
need to exclude from the test the regions those "name" starts with
"ACPI", but I'm not sure how we can do that.
Thanks,
