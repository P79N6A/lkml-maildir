For what it's worth, that table is in the original 1995 version.
"Change 2" in Feb 01 completely redid chapter 8, and removed said
table.  It's unclear what, if any, replacement table should be used.
I'll follow up if I find out anything specific - the current text just says:
"Instructions on clearing, sanitization and release of IS media shall be issued
by the accrediting CSA."
