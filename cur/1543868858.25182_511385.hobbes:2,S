Without the sources it's hard to tell. And all these applications are
vendor-specific, so if they indeed have ways to avoid conflicting
accesses between ACPI and the rest of the system, these ways are likely
to be vendor-specific as well, and not documented.
Either way, this means we need the support from hardware vendors to
solve this concurrent access problem, and unfortunately I doubt this
happens anytime soon :(
