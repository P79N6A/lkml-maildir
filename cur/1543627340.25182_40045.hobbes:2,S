My point the problem is not memory or the BIOS not allocating enough
memory.  The problem is (a) using the BIOS and (b) the BIOS not believing
it can to do the job when X has enough memory.
All I have seen in the X error messages was an error message that the BIOS
could not set the video mode.  My response, why the heck is the driver
doing BIOS calls.  I'm not a fan at all of using someone else's drivers
after the kernel loads.
Heck I'm not even a fan of using a closed source BIOS.
