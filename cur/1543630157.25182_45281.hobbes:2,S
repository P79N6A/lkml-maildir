Any chance you could rename this from "LFS" to something else (e.g. LBD
for Large Block Device).  LFS == Large File Summit which describes the

For 64-bit systems like Alpha, it is relatively easy to use 8kB blocks for
ext3.  It has been discouraged because such a filesystem is non-portable
to other (smaller page-sized) filesystems.  Maybe this rationale should
be re-examined - I could probably whip up a configure option for
e2fsprogs to allow 8kB blocks in a few hours.
Does x86-64 and/or ia64 actually _use_ > 4kB page sizes?  If so, it
may be more worthwhile to allow larger block sizes with e2fsprogs.
It may be that the kernel supports >4kB blocks already on systems with
larger PAGE_SIZE, I don't know (no way for me to test this).

I find it somewhat ironic that you suggest reiserfs over ext3, when in
fact they both currently have the same 16TB filesystem limit.  On your
web page, you say the ext[23] limit is 1TB, which it definitely is not
(unless there are bugs in the code).  There is currently a 16TB filesystem
limit for 4kB blocks, but there are plans towards fixing that also.

LVM does not need to have partitions, and presumably EVMS using Linux
or AIX LVM devices doesn't either.
