No, wmb is not enough. I've provided an explanation in the original thread.

Actually, there seems to be _no_ problem at all, provided a task to be
woken up is _not_ running on another CPU at the exact moment of
wakeup.
Why?
shared_data = new;
wake_up_task(p);
(1) try_to_wake_up() holds a lock of the runqueue on which 'p' is to-be-placed ;
(2) it's _guaranteed_ that 'shared_data' will be updated by the moment
any UNLOCK is called  -- in our case, try_to_wake_up(p) calls
unlock(&rq->lock);
(3) for 'p' to start running, something must call schedule() -> which
will take 'rq->lock'... and 'rq' is the same as in (2).
IOW, 'p' can't start running untill try_to_wake_up(p) releases
'rq->lock', and as said in (2), that implies that 'shared_data' will
be up-to-date by this moment.
IOW #2, 'rq->lock' is kind of a synchronization point/'barrier' in this case.
does it make sense now?
Another point is if 'p' is actually _running_ on another CPU at the
time when we do try_to_wake_up()... and I guess, the potential problem
is only relevant for situations like below:
CPU #0:
EIP_1 ---> (*)   /* so 'p' is at this point now */
set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
if (shared_data == magic)
        schedule();
CPU #1:
shared_data = magic;
try_to_wake_up(p);
now the problem is if 'p->state' (inside try_to_wake_up()) will be
loaded _before_ 'shared_data' has been updated.
recall, we are about to execute set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)
on CPU #0...
so
p->state is still TASK_RUNNING, meaning that try_to_wake_up() just
exits ! (nothing to be done)
in the mean time,
on CPU #0: set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) is called.
shared_data is checked _but_ it's still an old value (CPU #1 is still
inside try_to_wake_up(p))
so we call schedule() and go to sleep...
i.e. we actually lost a wakeup.
to sum it up, for the following scheme to work:
set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);  <--- here we have a smb_mb()
if (condition)
        schedule();
effectively => (1) MODIFY(current->state) ; (2) LOAD(condition)
and a wake_up path must ensure access (LOAD or MODIFY) to the same
data happens in the _reverse_ order:
condition = new;
smb_mb();
try_to_wake_up();
=> (1) MODIFY(condition); (2) LOAD(current->state)
try_to_wake_up() does not need to be a full mb per se, the only
requirement (and only for situation like above) is that there is a
full mb between possible write ops. that have taken place before
try_to_wake_up() _and_ a load of p->state inside try_to_wake_up().
does it make sense #2 ? :-)
(yeah, maybe I'm just too paranoid :-)
