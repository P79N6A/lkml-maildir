Hi,
I currently try installing Linux on an old IBM Laptop. (IBM Thinkpad 340, 
486SLC 25/50 from 1994). The laptop only has 4 MB RAM, so I installed a 
simple Linux distribution on a better computer, recompiled Linux 2.4.20 and 
stripped out everything I could (with menuconfig): No networking. FPU 
emulation. The only "luxury" I left is "ext3" - perhaps this uses a lot of 
memory?
Well - anyway, the kernel boots but right stops after:
INIT: Entering runlevel:3
The next line is:
INIT: open(/dev/console): Input/output error
INIT: Id "2" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
...
That's it.
What I want to know is if this happens just because of the low memory (4MB) or 
if there is another reason for this behaviour.
What do you think: What are the minimum requirements for Linux on such a 
laptop (no X, of course, very simple setup): 8MB, 12MB?
		Best Regards,
		Hermann
