I know what you mean. It would be better to store all "private" zfcp
data at dd_data in fc_rport.  Unfortunately it won't fit to zfcp's
current behaviour.  The rport depends on a specific host_id. Even the
name of the rport in sys/class/fc_remote_port inherits this id. This
means if the host is deregistered and registered again the old rport
structure is useless because new host_ids are assigned. Or do I miss
something here?
The zfcp_port structure is thought to be persistent if once configured
by the user, i.e. even if the host is deregistered and registered
again the port structure is kept.
I am not sure at the moment how this can be solved with the current
fc_transport. I think it would have been better to use the WWPN of an
rport as the name in sys/class/fc_remote_port. This would be a start
to keep rport structures independent of the host_id. (Why should the
transport depend on OS assigned ids anyway? The transport has already
unique identifiers like WWPNs.)

In any case attributes provided by an rport should be removed from the
zfcp_port structure. This is what I will do next.
