i like that! One forcedeth annoyance that triggers frequently on one of 
my testboxes is:
[  120.955202] eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
[  121.233865] eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
[  129.215450] eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
[  139.734408] eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
[  144.546811] eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
[  153.811005] eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
[  154.695879] eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
[  155.455078] eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
