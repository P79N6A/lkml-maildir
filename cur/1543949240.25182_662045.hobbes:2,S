Let me first clarify what I meant when I said "I think we have the same problem".
Suppose that we have the "int sigcont_received" flag which is set by the SIGCONT
handler. Now, the main thread sends SIGSTOP to itself, and another thread does:
	if (this_task_is_stopped("/proc/self/status") {
		// If I'am here and running, I was woken by SIGCONT.
		// Otherwise I must see the group-stop-in-progress
		// "signal" after syscall
		ASSERT(sigcont_received == 1);
	}
This assertion abibe may fail. But of course, this example is completely
artificial, there is no real problem.
However, I think this lock-drop is really wrong by another reason. Suppose
that another sig_kernel_stop() signal comes when we drop ->siglock. The new
signal should dismiss the "pending" SIGCONT, but this doesn't happen.
When handle_stop_signal() re-takes ->siglock it removes the new signal.
Worse. Let's suppose that the new signal was already deueued by some thread
before handle_stop_signal() re-takes ->siglock. This thread initiates the
new group stop (note that we cleared ->group_stop_count). Now we are waking
up all TASK_STOPPED threads, but we don't clear ->group_stop_count. This
means that eventually the thread group will have SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED set
but not all threads are stopped.

Well yes, but what if CLONE_THREAD task autoreaps itself?

Thanks! I really hoped the answer will be like that.

This breaks ptrace_stop()->do_notify_parent_cldstop(CLD_TRAPPED) but I see
what you mean.
Anyway, I think we can clean up this separately. This CLD_STOPPED reported
from handle_stop_signal() is "group wide" anyway. Actually, I think that
get_signal_to_deliver() can just do
	do_notify_parent_cldstop(current->group_leader, why);
, this even looks more sane to me.

OK, thanks. But let's look at this scenario with the different angle.
We pretend that the group stop was already finished, and report CLD_STOPPED.
But at the same time, this SIGCONT "cancels" this group stop, so what we have
is "stopped and then continued". Isn't it better to always report CLD_CONTINUED?
(yes, this looks as if the preceding CLD_STOPPED was somehow lost, but still).
To avoid a possible confusing, I am not really arguing, just curious. This
issue is minor anyway.

Agreed, thanks!
