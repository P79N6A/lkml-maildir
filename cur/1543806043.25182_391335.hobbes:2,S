Well, the following 4 patches have been in -mm for a while, are fairly
trivial and I've not heard any complains about them, so I guess they
might as well move on and get into 2.6.16 :
   decrease-number-of-pointer-derefs-in-jsm_ttyc.patch
   docs-update-missing-files-and-descriptions-for-filesystems-00-index.patch
   reduce-nr-of-ptr-derefs-in-fs-jffs2-summaryc.patch
   sound-remove-unneeded-kmalloc-return-value-casts.patch
