Good to hear you finally got it to work, and can enjoy the extra few 
milliseconds of battery life :) Now the real problem is what to do
with the idle to take advantage of the extra idle time... I'm not
convinced that hlt or ACPI C2/C3 actually sleep through it. Maybe
there's something more that can be done?
