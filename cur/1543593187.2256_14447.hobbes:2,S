Actually most X servers are heavily optimised to avoid video->video copies and
use the accelerators. If you are using the frame buffer X server then yes
it can be a problem but look up 'shadowfb'.

Your writes are running at bus speed. Assuming the video ram has an mtrr for
write combining you are doing full bursts. When you read the sequence instead
is
	issue read
	stall cpu
	pci cycle goes out for one longword
	pci cycle hits the video card
	video card replies a longword
	cpu gets it
So the entire pci bus latency is directly biting you for each fetch.
