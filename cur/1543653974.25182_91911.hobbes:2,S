Hello,
<<What do you want to do?
>>I want to simulate a PCI based controller and its behaviour, interrupts,etc..
I want to simulate the interrupts in sequence and want to process them in my driver software.
<<local_irq_save()/local_irq_restore() temporarily disable the interrupt 
>>My requirement is to simulate interrupts and not to disable interrupts.
Thanks & Warm Regards

What do you want to do?
local_irq_save()/local_irq_restore() temporarily disable the interrupt 
processing of the current cpu. Note that other cpus in the system 
continue to handle interrupts.
disable_irq(x) disables the interrupt processing for the interrupt line x.
For example, my network drivers use disable_irq() to synchronize 
interrupt processing and error recovery.
