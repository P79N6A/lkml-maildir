I tested the patch in 2.4.x and seems to meet all the discussed
requirements. 
I have another suggestion to this subject. When the buffer oveflows in
icaonon mode, it would be *best* if the application either gets a
complete line or does not get it at all. On a buffer overflow, it would
be good that the n_tty discard the whole line data in the buffer (part
of which has overflown) and make more room in the buffer.
Does it make sense to any of you?
