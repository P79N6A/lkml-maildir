I just applied the patch to 2.6.16-rc3 and booted the patched kernel.
Unfortunately I can't tell you if it fixes the bug since I never
successfully reproduced it, it just happened once out of the blue.
What I can tell you though is that the patched kernel seems to behave
just fine and doesn't seem to introduce any regressions on my system -
but my testing has been quite limited so far.
Not the best feedback, I know, but it's the best I can give you at the moment.
