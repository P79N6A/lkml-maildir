Check the list archive, there was someone telling about support they
added for binary blobs in /proc (or was it sysfs?) for this (among
others) very purpose.
Please don't make the situation any worse.  I'd like to have some hope
that Debian my publish their kernel-source package with a
linux-x.x.x.tar.bz2 that matches the md5sum of the one on kernel.org
some day.
Regards,
Jeremy
