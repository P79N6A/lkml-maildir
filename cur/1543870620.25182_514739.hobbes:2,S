Subject: [PATCH 3/9] swap: Catch pages with errors and mark as bad
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/2/165

Check for pages with errors within shrink_page_list() and if found, try
to unuse them which will trigger the functions to mark the page bad. The
page will then be allocated a new swap page.
If a swap page write error occurs, don't disable page reclaim.
Based on a patch by Nick Piggin and some of my own changes as discussed
on LKML.
