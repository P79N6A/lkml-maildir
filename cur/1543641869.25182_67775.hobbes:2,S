The ck5 kernel comes in more than one flavor
rmap, aa and low latency are offered -
I'm running 2.4.19-ck5-ll and I'm happy to report
that it also plays well with freeswan ipsec - I'm
running freeswan 1.98b and it's all good - not to
mention the nice smooth feel in multimedia and
3D fps shooters ;-)
Thanks to conman for the tedious patching work!
