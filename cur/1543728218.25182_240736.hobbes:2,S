As you did not mention which writer and wich OS you are talking, it is hard to 
tell anything about the reasons.
If you like to write DVDs, you of course need cdrecord-ProDVD
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/ProDVD/
I am trying my best so support any DVD writer since 1997
Note that there is no DVD support in the GPLd cdrecord and if you use the 
original version, you will get hints leading you to cdrecord-ProDVD.
Also note that I don't like to feed trolls, so I don't like to discuss
cdrecord-ProDVD here and I will not answer related questions - they are all
answered in the documentation. Cdrecord-ProDVD is free for personal use and 
this will not change in the future.
