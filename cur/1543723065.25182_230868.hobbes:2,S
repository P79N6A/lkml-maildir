Uh.... That might work.... Except that after applying the patch & 
restarting. Then suspend-resume I get another small problem... My 
thinkpad (r50p) uses the power button to wake up from suspend... The 
system wakes, but with this latest patch, acpid then kicks in & says 
'Ohh! I saw him press the power button' and promptly shuts down...
here's my acpid logfile

Sleeps, wakes & a shutdown... Should acpid do that? (i.e. shouldn't it 
eat the power button event that woke it up as a wakeup? Should it even 
get that?) Or is it the previous patch for drivers/acpi/sleep/main.c 
resetting the IRQ9 to edge triggered that's killing me? (I'll try 
removing that now).
[Note, I've recieved a note regarding the wakeup & shutdown problem... 
It's a bug perhaps? Does anyone know whether the bug is that acpi 
shouldn't get the power button event after the resume? Or is it a bug 
that acpid itself doesn't eat the event as we've just resumed (How does 
it know the button was to wakeup & wasn't really to shutdown?) or is the 
bug in the scripts (unlikely... The 'workaround' I was pointed at 
scrapes the log to find out if we've just resumed... But what if the 
logfilesystem is full... No log & we'll shutdown anyway, so I'd suspect 
acpid myself... Anyone confirm which area is actually responsible?
TIA
Hamish.
