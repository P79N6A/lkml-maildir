I believe it was a good experience. However, I still find it sad that
there are changes between the latest -rc and the final version. This
time, it seems it did not cause trouble, but in the past, it happened
several times, because any valid fix can have side effects.
I think that if you could announce what you intend to release with a
message like "I will make this -final tomorrow", there would be some
time to test builds in various configs, and check that no obvious bug
has been introduced.

Willy
