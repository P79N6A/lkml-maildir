When I run bonnie on my magneto-optical drive linux seems
windos running on a vic-20. The system is completely unusable. For
example Netscape takes 1 minute to show a message storen in my
homedir! Everything that tries to write something to the disk
remains blocked in D state for 10s of second. I'm talking of
files stored on my HD, not on the MO drive, and the're on
different controllers.
I changed /proc/.../freepages to have 10MB of free mem, so I really
can't see a good reason to delay all disk accesses so much.
Then I tried this:
dd if=/dev/zero of=xxx bs=1024 count=10000  (10MB)
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system        cpu
 r  b  w swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us  sy id

It looks OK.
but:
dd if=/dev/zero of=xxx bs=1024 count=100000  (100MB)
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system        cpu
 r  b  w swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us  sy id

Blocks-out rate drops to a ridiculous speed after a few second, with a small
burst every 10-15 sec. The drive can write at about 600KB/s, so "bo" should
be ~300 (2K blocks) all the time.  Why ?
And why does it affects output on other devices ?
Uuhh, I've just noted that sync and kupdate are blocked in D state...
wonderful.
Ah, it's just returned. They took 2m27s doing absolutely nothing :-((
The strange thing is that as soon as I can break dd, it restart writing at
the right speed. Perhaps there is something wrong in the new elevator code ?
I have 192MB or ram. I also tried booting with 64MB (my old PMac have 64MB
and it doesn't show this problem with the same kernel - only the SCSI
driver differs) and it behaves about the same, but at the beginning of
the test the drive writes at the right speed for ~30 sec instead of ~8.
Is it possible this problem is caused by the SCSI driver ?  I don't have
problems with my HD attached to another identical Adaptec 2930U.
