Hi Alasdair,
Thanks for the immediate reply.
So as far as I understand, the point is:
  1. it's preferable to resize inode after the resume, if possible
  2. it's necessary to have nowait version of bdget() to avoid stall
For the 1st item, I guess the reason is that we want to make the
table swapping code deterministic. Is it correct?
Even if we don't have to wait for bdget(), you like to have the resizing
code after the resume?
For the 2nd item, the patch included bdlookup() for that purpose.
What do you think about it?
I added below some additional comments and questions.

bdlookup() is the almost nowait version of bdget()
("almost" means it may wait for I_NEW turned off in case there is
  bdget() doing its latter half. But it never stalls.)
Do you think we need something else?

Even though, I think we still want set_capacity() during the table
swapping. So we need to call dm_table_get_size() twice. Is it ok?
Also, do you want to move the resizing code for normal suspend, too?
Otherwise, the code will be duplicated and I don't think you like it.
Thanks,
