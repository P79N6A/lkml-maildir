So are the new bits of the patch related to the KSTK_E* bit?
They don't seem to be ... however, this bit looks really good:
> -#define KSTK_EIP(tsk)	(((unsigned long *)(4096+(unsigned long)(tsk)->thread_info))[1019])
> -#define KSTK_ESP(tsk)	(((unsigned long *)(4096+(unsigned long)(tsk)->thread_info))[1022])
> +#define KSTK_EIP(task)	((task)->thread.eip)
> +#define KSTK_ESP(task)	((task)->thread.esp)
Can I assume it's tested, or does it need someone to do that?
Thanks,
M.
