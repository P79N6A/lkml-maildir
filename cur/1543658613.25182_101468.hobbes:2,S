   Just to clarify something that I saw getting lost in this discussion:
   Oprofile doesn't need to become built as a 64-bit binary, just
   configured to accept 64-bit kernels.  So this doesn't rule out using a
   32-bit oprofile (i.e. not needing a 64-bit libc) on a 64-bit kernel. 
   It just means that we need to specify it somehow.
That's right, indeed.  And furthermore, I'm willing to eat the 64-bit
overhead for all sparc builds. :)
