I did some tests with different VM-patches. I tested one ac-patch, too. 
I detected the same as you described - but the memory-consumption and 
the behaviour at all isn't better. If you want to, you can test another 
patch, which worked best in my test. It's nearly as good as kernel 
2.2.x. Ask M.H.vanLeeuwen (vanl@megsinet.net) for his oom-patch to 
kernel 2.4.17.
But beware: maybe this strategy doesn't fit to your applications. And 
it's not for productive use.
I and some others surely too, would be interested in your experience 
with this patch.

Dynamic selection - this would be great. For all situations the best 
swapping strategy. On servers switched with a cronjob or a intelligent 
daemon.
