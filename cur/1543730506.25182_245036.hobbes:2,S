Unfortunately, there are issues with current PRO/1000 devices that
make MSI unusable.  Other testing has show similar results to what you
are reporting, under low load a few interrupts can be observed to work
but the part stops working when stressed.  This is why MSI has not
already been enabled in the e1000 driver.
