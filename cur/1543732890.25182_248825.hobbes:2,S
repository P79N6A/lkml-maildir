Right now the kernel is in sole control.  The device I am testing this on  
is a Sharp Zaurus SL5500, which has two leds that by default are used to  
light when new mail arrives and if the power is plugged in.
A read-only interface should probably be added?
The function stuff was intended to be controlled by the kernel, but I think  
now that I should just remove this and let userspace do it.  If we just  
allow userspace an easy way to turn the leds on and off (and stuff like  
power state is available elsewhere in sysfs) a simple shell script could  
turn the led to show the power state.
