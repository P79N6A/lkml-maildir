OK there are those test cases.
Well...  Either we chmod to 0644, or we fix the tests to 'chmod +w' like 
it is already done in t5302.
In any case I wouldn't die() but only error() on a failure to chmod().  
It is sure inconvenient if the pack isn't world readable, but it is not 
a "fatal" problem for the repack.
