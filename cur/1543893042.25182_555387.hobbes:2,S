did you read my explination of the analogy?

what SELinux cannot do is figure out what label to assign a new file.
but the bigger problem in changing SELinux to behave like AA is that the 
SELinux people disagree with the concept of AA. they don't believe that 
it's secure, so why would they add useless bloat that would only 
complicate their code and make systems less secure? I don't happen to 
agree with their opinion of AA obviously, but they have the right to their 
opinion, and it is their code. why should they be asked to implement and 
support something they disagree with so fundamentally?
remember that the security hooks in the kernel are not SELinux API's, they 
are the Loadable Security Model API. What the AA people are asking for is 
for the LSM API to be modified enough to let their code run (after that 
(and working in parallel) they will work on getting the rest of their code 
approved for the kernel, but the LSM hooks are the most critical)
