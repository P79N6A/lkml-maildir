When I was bringing the m68k tree back in sync near the end of 1999, I used the
following approach:
  - keep all trees, use `cp -rl' and `patch' when a new version is released
    (cfr. Al Viro)
  - use `same' to prevent the need for zillions of disk space, and to make the
    creation of diffs between such trees fast
  - merge trees using my home-brew `mergetree' perl script (basically a
    recursive `merge' command), which can replace the destination file by a
    hard link if it's the same as one of the originals
Despite having a real CVS repository for m68k now, I still use mergetree...
