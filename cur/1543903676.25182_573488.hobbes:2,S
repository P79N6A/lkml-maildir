The difference would be that read() will only return 4 bytes, while the
application will expect 8.  If the application is checking the size of
returned value, as it should, then it will be able to detect the problem
(it could even be sophisticated enough to know that if this is a 4-byte
return, then it is running on an old 2.6.22 kernel).  If the application is
not checking the return from read(), then its 8-byte buffer will not be
filled -- the contents of the last 4 bytes will be undefined, so the u64
value as a whole will be junk.
