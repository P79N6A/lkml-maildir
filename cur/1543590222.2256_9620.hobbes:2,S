Well, the problem is that the patch _is_ buggy. 
swap_writepage() does it right. And dead_swap_page does it wrong. It
doesn't look at the swap counts, for one thing.
The patch should be reverted. The fact that other parts of the system do
it _right_ is not an argument for mm/vmscan.c to do it wrong.
What do you expect me to do? The patch is buggy. It should be reverted.
What's your problem?
