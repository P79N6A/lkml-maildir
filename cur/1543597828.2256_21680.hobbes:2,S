What Pavel says is true only if the data structure for holding pending
timers degrades into good O(1) insertion & deletion time in the tickless case.
I recall George Anzinger saying something about the current ticked
scheduler being able to insert timers that never reach expiry very
efficiently (simply a list insert + delete), whereas the current
tickless code could not do that.
Is that right?  Is it the data structure that is taking too long to
process, when many timers that do not reach expiry are inserted?  There
would be one such insertion and deletion on every context switch, right?
