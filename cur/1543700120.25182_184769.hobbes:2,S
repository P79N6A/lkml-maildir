We have 88 open bugs against ACPI (out of 216 total).  They fall into
two broad categories -- boot/configuration (eg. interrupt issues); and
run-time features (eg. acpi events -- power-down, fan control etc). 
#1038 mentioned here has sort of grown out of control into "anything at
all wrong with anybody's IBM T40", so I'm not sure it will ever be
completely closed;-)
I agree with Andy Grover's comments in this file that fixing the bugs
one by one in the current design is the highest priority; and I think
that strategy is showing positive results.

Now that you're back, we should probably pull the current 2.6.0 ACPI
patch into the mm tree, since 2.6 without it is now somewhat behind
2.4.23.
I understand that consolidated plain patches are preferred for the mm
tree.  I assume that the actual pull into the release tree can still be
done using bk so that we can preserve the individual csets and their
comments?

acpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net is preferred -- it includes the Intel
alias above plus the rest of planet ACPI.
