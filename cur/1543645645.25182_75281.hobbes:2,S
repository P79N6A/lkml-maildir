Subject: Rsync SSH session hang, AGAIN  -  Help!  Deadlock debugging needed.

This has been a recurring problem for a couple years which I and others 
have experienced.  I was free from it for a while, but after upgrading 
OpenSSL/OpenSSH to avoid the recent exploit it is back and highly 
repeatable.  This has been persistant enough that I am going to start 
with the assumption that it may be a kernel bug, or at least probably 
debuggable definitively only by a proficient kernel developer.  We have 
got to squash this once and for all; SSH is used everywhere and it needs 
to be reliable.  Probably there is a race condition in ssh, as mentioned 
below, but it must be subtle.
rsync/ssh transfers from local system to local system work perfectly. 
 Between the systems, there is nearly always large delays at certain 
times and usually a complete hang.  After a long period, this often 
produces a timeout.  These sytems are on 100baseT on the same switch. 
 One system appears to be having mild packet loss (400 out of 400,000 on 
both send and receive as frame/carrier erros).  BTW, running a cpio 
through the SSH connections causes a nearly immediate hang, so it is 
unlikely to be a problem with rsync.
Both systems work find receiving rsync/ssh from my laptop over a 400Kb 
DSL connection with:
OpenSSH 3.1p1
openssl 0.9.6c
rsync 2.5.4
gcc 2.96
kernel 2.4.19
(systems are a combination of Suse and Redhat 7.3, upgraded variously by 
hand)
My standard rsync/ssh script looks like:
brsyncndz (backup rsync no delete or compression):
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$PORT" = "" ]; then PORT=22; fi
rsync -vv -HpogDtSxlra --partial --progress --stats -e "ssh -p $PORT" $*
On both sides:
OpenSSL-0.9.6g
Openssh-3.4p1
rsync-2.5.5
On 'old' system:
gcc 2.95.2
kernel 2.4.3
On 'new' system:
gcc 2.96
kernel 2.4.20-pre8
References to past discussions:  (Tried the TCP buffers tuning.)
