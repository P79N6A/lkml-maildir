powerpc allyesconfig fails on the following two drivers (iseries_defconfig
fails for the veth one):
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c: In function 'ehea_driver_sysfs_add':
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:2812: error: 'struct device_driver' has no member named 'kobj'
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:2815: error: 'struct device_driver' has no member named 'kobj'
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:2818: error: 'struct device_driver' has no member named 'kobj'
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c: In function 'ehea_driver_sysfs_remove':
drivers/net/ehea/ehea_main.c:2830: error: 'struct device_driver' has no member named 'kobj'
drivers/net/iseries_veth.c: In function 'veth_module_init':
drivers/net/iseries_veth.c:1714: error: 'struct device_driver' has no member named 'kobj'
I'm guessing it's some of Greg's kobj/driver patches that missed to
change this, but it's not obvious to me how it should be fixed.
