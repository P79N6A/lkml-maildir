I'm using the ASUS P4B533's and P4B533-E's here successfully, very stable
motherboards, both on our Windows PC's and Linux servers.
As well, there's a few MSI 845 based boards being used here.
3ware makes very nice cards, both in the PATA(7xxx) and SATA(8xxx)
versions.  Be warned, they're more expensive than other IDE cards.
They're made in 2, 4, 8 and 12 port models.
I've had problems with both Promise and Highpoint cards in the
past(highpoint hpt366's were especially buggy under any OS).
The 3ware's can be used with software or hardware raid(they're hardware),
and seem to be actively supported by 3ware.
