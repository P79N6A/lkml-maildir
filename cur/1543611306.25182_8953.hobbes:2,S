Subject: kapm-idled no longer idling CPU?

I posted this question about a month ago, but haven't seen a response
since, so I'm reposting.
I'm having a problem with all recent 2.4 systems that when any
application that uses more than very minor system resources is running,
(i.e. mozilla, netscape, xemacs, apache, Tomcat, just to name a few
common ones I've seen this behaviour with) kapm-idled no longer receives
scheduling time from what I can tell and I assume that means my CPU is
never getting idled when nothing is scheduled.
I'm pretty sure this is a legit problem and not just kapm-idled
reporting its time incorrectly since my laptop has gone from about 2-1/2
hours of battery life in early 2.4 versions to less than 1 hour of
battery life under the same conditions for recent kernels.  Plus, if I
exit everything until I'm just sitting at a shell prompt, I'll see
kapm-idled start to receive time again.  (Of course, the laptop isn't
much fun when it's not running anything...)
I've seen this on a number of laptops and desktop machines since about
2.4.9 or so.
