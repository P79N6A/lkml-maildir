Hmm, last time I checked Solaris, I thought it did, but that was
Solaris 11. I'll plan to fire up my solaris qemu image and test
it again...

Good point. POSIX is frustratingly ambiguous on this:
     Upon successful completion, where nbyte is greater than 0, write()
     shall mark for update the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file,
     and if the file is a regular file, the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of
     the file mode may be cleared.
...the "may" in that last sentence makes it optional, I suppose. Even if
it weren't then I guess there's also an argument that a write that comes
in via a nfs server may not be subject to the same semantics as the
write() syscall.
In any case, "broken" is probably too strong a term :-)
