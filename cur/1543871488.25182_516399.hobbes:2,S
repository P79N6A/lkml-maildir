Just a heads up to everyone,
Zeus1 (one of the frontend machines) will be offline for an extended
period starting late on March 6th, 2007 (PST).  This is to make some
array changes (moving from raid5 to raid6) and to flip the file system
on the mirrors to xfs.  There is no ETA on when zeus1 will come back up
as it will need to resync the entire mirrors after the changes.  Zeus2
will still be online and serving all of the public kernel.org traffic in
the interim, so please be kind to it.
If you have any questions, comments or concerns please don't hesitate to
get ahold of me.
