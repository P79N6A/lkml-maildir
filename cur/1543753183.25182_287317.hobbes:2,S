I went for a dig in the archives
The original fix removed the tx/rx data from the file if you weren't
priviledged. Linus did the directory hack because he didn't want to
worry about drivers that got missed out/not fixed.
So there's a janitor project there - to go through all the tty/serial
drivers and make sure they don't give out excessively useful information
to non CAP_SYS_RAWIO users, then loosen permissions.
