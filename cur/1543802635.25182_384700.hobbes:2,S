Okay I'll take a look at this in the context of both the old mux and
the new mux code.

maybe?  Its been a while since I looked at this code, but I believe
the logic is that if you are approaching the end of the file you'll
get less than rsize bytes back and then you just fill in the rest of
the page with zeros.

No, something funky happened and I didn't proof the patch like I should have.

Its quite possible I've done the wrong thing here.  The intent is to
make sure that any stuff that might be in the page cache due to an
mmap is flushed when I do a write.  This approach is overkill, I
should probably just flush anything in the cache that the write
affects.
I'll take another look at the mux stuff and also see if I can come up
with a less brute-force approach to invalidating the page cache.
thanks for the comments.
