TSO is support on 82540.  Turning off TSO is a workaround, but what's
behind the dependency of TSO and ip_conntrack?  You indicated in an
earlier note that having the ip_conntrack module loaded was a factor.
Do you have a nic to try with tg3?  I believe tg3 has TSO enabled as
well (in 2.6.0-test11).
