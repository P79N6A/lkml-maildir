	   Can you at least add the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE declaration
   and the pci_device_id table that it refers to, even if the code
   does not directly reference it?  (You can make it as __initdata
   rather than __devinitdata, since it can safely be thrown away.)
   That was automatic PCI ID recognition will work.
Feel free to send me a patch which does this.  No problem.
Later,
