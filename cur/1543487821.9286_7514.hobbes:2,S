Subject: PCMCIA floppy for 2.2.x?

I have a Toshiba Libretto 100CT.  It ships with a PCMCIA floppy drive and
no on-board FDC.  I found a patch/module for 2.0.x series kernels
(floppy-cs)  which replaces the kernel's floppy driver with a module which
supports the drive, but I've not been tempted to try and shoehorn this
into 2.2.x.
I was wondering if anyone would have a recommendation for PCMCIA hardware
that's already supported by the kernel that would let me use floppy disks.
I have a SCSI PCMCIA card so maybe a SCSI floppy drive would work -- but
I've never actually seen a SCSI floppy drive, and I imagine it would be
expensive.
Ideas?
Thanks,
Thomas Lakofski.
