The NEC and Altix machines both use a SLIT table to describe the machine 
layout, so it should be possible to build them correctly w/o special case 
code (I hope).  The question is how big to make them, but if that's runtime 
changeable, then no big deal.  Like I said, the main thing missing from my 
changes is a system wide domain, but I think John has some ideas about that.
