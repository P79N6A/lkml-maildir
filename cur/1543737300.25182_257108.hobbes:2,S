Subject: Reading ati_remote keypresses in userland

I have an ati_ remote, and the ati_remote module loaded, the 2.2.0 version 
with kernel version 2.6.5-1. It works in that I can see data 
on /dev/input/mice when I use the mouse type controls on the remote. However 
I need to use the keyboardish buttons to control my application. 
Having read round it seemed the /dev/input/event devices would be the key. I 
put together some code to find the right event device and dump the output 
from a linux journal article : 
The device on /dev/input/event0 says its name is PS/2 Generic Mouse 
The device on /dev/input/event1 says its name is AT Translated Set 2 
keyboard 
The device on /dev/input/event2 says its name is X10 Wireless Technology Inc 
USB Receiver 
evdev driver version is 1.0.0 
...but there's no output turning up when I read from the file descriptor. 
However, running the module in debug mode does give meaningful output to 
/var/log/messages :

index 33; keycode 148 
I'm a bit confused. Which device should I be looking at for these 
keypresses? Am I missing something? 
My test code is at 
http://www.i-r-genius.com/remoteend.c
Could anyone confirm exactly which device these keypresses should turn up on 
and the method for reading them?
Thanks for any help. 
The aim of this project is to provide a simple control for music player 
daemon (
http://www.musicpd.org/
) without the need for X. I will, of course, 
release the code when done.
