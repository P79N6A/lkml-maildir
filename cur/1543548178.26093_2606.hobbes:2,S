Ohhh cool. While I don't use debuggers myself, I know people
who really like having a good debugger around and are more
productive finding and fixing problems when they have one.
A debugger is a good tool for some people and, IMHO, it would
be good for those people to have the choice of applying your
patch and fixing the problems in their style...

It should be interesting to see what happens here. First
SAMBA, then the Kerberos thing and now NDS ... looks like
we might be able to beat Microsoft on their home turf ;)
(yes, I know IRIX has the SAMBA performance record, but
still... ;))
