Subject: [patch] no need for kernel_flag on UP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
Attached patch is a minor cleanup (and memory reduction for gcc < 3). 
We currently define and declare the BKL's kernel_flag spinlock on either
SMP or PREEMPT, which means a UP+PREEMPT machine gets it.
We only need the actual lock on SMP.
Patch is against current BK, please apply.
