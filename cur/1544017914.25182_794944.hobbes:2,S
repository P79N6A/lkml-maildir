These rules are broken, and match also on firewire devices and not
only video4linux devices.
Such rules are not part of the standard udev setup and need to be
fixed to work as intended. There is no change or fault at the kernel
side. You may just disable the firefire drivers if you don't need
them.
Btw, swapping default kernel names to devfs names and create symlinks
for the kernel names is not recommended at all.
