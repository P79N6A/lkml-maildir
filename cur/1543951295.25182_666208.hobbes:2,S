50cm gotta be short enough.  For intel ahci, it definitely isn't a
general problem but it would still be nice if we can find out what's
going on but I don't have much idea what to do next.  I'll keep your
problem in mind and see whether any pattern emerges.  If you find out
something new, please let us know.
Thanks.
