Are you sure this is not related to the routing daemon or rdisc daemon you 
use ? In the past when I had problems with lost default routes always such
a daemon was to blame.

Sounds more like an glibc issue. I would file a glibc gnats bug on this,
then it may even get fixed. The kernel has nothing to do with this at least.
