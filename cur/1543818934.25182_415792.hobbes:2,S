I'd have thought it would be more flexible were this to return the old
pointer.
If there was no old item, we could return NULL and "succeed".  But that gets
a bit ill-defined, because lack of an old pointer can occur if either a)
there was a layer, but the slot was empty or b) there wasn't a layer for
this new item.  So perhaps it's best to continue considering lack of an old
pointer as an error, with ERR_PTR(-ENOENT).
