Subject: [PATCH] agpgart splitup and cleanup for 2.5.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

So there I was, trying to remove pci_find_device() and pci_find_class()
from the 2.5 kernel (it's an old depreciated api, so don't start
complaining...) when I ran across the agpgart code which uses
pci_find_class().  I realized I'd have to fix this driver to use the
"new" pci api if I had a chance of getting rid of pci_find_class().
Dave Jones had previously split up this driver into some very nice
logical parts, and it has been living successfully in his tree for a
while now.
So I took that patch, and cleaned it up a bit more (removed some
unneeded typedefs, whitespace changes, moved the Config.in and
Configure.help stuff to the drivers/char/agp directory) and ported the
driver to the pci_register_module() api.  It seems to work for me, so I
would appreciate it if other people tested it out before I sent it on to
Linus for inclusion in the main 2.5 tree.
