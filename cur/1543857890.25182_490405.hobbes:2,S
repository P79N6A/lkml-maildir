I doubt of the generic usefulness of that flag, as it would be mere
equivalent of resource->parent == NULL.
I think the IORESOURCE_UNSET flag came from PnP and PCI subsystem has
never used it.

Yes, it's ugly. But, IIRC, this was the only way to prevent some drivers
and arch code from using an unassigned resource...

No - it checks the resource->parent and doesn't touch the resources which
are already assigned.

Well, as IORESOURCE_UNSET usage seems to be an exclusive PPC32 thing,
there is no much difference. ;-)
Though I agree that ignoring the return value of pci_assign_resource()
is entirely valid in most cases.
