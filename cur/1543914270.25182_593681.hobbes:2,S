Well, maybe if modules could be used similarly to: "modprobe  
my_module --help" to give a description of the available module  
parameters.  That information might be merged into modules from text  
file(s) or vice-versa, but I can see it being significantly more  
useful.  Another mildly-useful feature would be to stick the basic  
boot params and those for built-in modules into a little text file  
which could optionally be embedded in the initramfs along with the  
"less" binary, so that a "vmlinuz --help" could be made to work  
usefully from your bootloader.
