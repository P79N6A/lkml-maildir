Ingo will have to answer the scheduler part of that.
But it's good to keep in mind that the scheduler can't do anything
about slowdowns due to tasks being swapped out or waiting on reads
from the disk. I mention this as shortly after CFS got into mainline,
something changed in the VM that seems to make my system spend a lot
more time in IO wait, causing the system to be much less responsive
than it used to be.
Unfortunately it seems to be dependent upon the history of what tasks
I've run and their memory usage, so it's been hard to come up with a
reproducible test case (well that and a complete lack of time). All I
can say is that I've seen what you've reported as well, though it had
nothing to do with using any 3d applications, just a browser, editor,
gcc, etc.
