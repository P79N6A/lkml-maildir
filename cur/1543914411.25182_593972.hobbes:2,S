# mkfs.xfs -n size=16384 <dev>
to create a filesystem with a 16k directory block size on a 4k page
machine.
Then just do operations on directories with lots of files in them
(tens of thousands). Every directory operation will require at
least one vmap in this situation - e.g. a traversal will result in
lots and lots of blocks being read that will require vmap() for every
directory block read from disk and an unmap almost immediately
afterwards when the reference is dropped....
Cheers,
Dave.
