Hi Ryan,
For the first part, yes, it can do non-consecutive gpios by using the
mask. Pins 3 and 7 are handled using a 5-bit mask. You'd  do
gpio_set_batch(3 <- starting pin is gpio 3, 0x0 <- clear, 0x1F <-
mask, 5 <- bit width of mask);

That's a tough question. My basic answer would be yes because I've
provided the generic set_batch handler that just uses single bit sets
to achieve it. See __generic_gpio_set_batch() in patch). But if your
question is deeper, ie: can it be optimized for other architectures? ;
then I think I have to handwave a bit. I believe it can, as most of
the CPUs I've seen expose gpio via a set register and clear register
with variation between a context register to select which bank/module
of gpios is being accessed versus just having a pool of set and clear
registers (like pxa). If a CPU didn't have this and just had a blanket
gpio register then the implementation would have to first read the
previous register value (or cache it) in order to support doing the
mask.

Good point. I'll put it in the docs.

Yes, it is as you have non-consecutive bits. In the above case the
mask width is 5 bits, but 3 bits are masked off, so we need the mask
so that the caller can tell us which bits are masked off.
Thanks,
