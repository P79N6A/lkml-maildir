hi
how can i get pointer to a file inode  ?
should i use namei or that it is better to have a user-space app opening
the file and passing me the fd( using ioctl ) ?
i saw that kernel code like sys_read is calling fget with the user space
fd, but i couldn't link with fget
please CC me for answers as i'm not register to the mailing list
