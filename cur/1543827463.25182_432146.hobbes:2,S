By design.
I think it would be fatal to report every event relevant
to statistical data gathering up to user space. It's fine to have
the kernel maintain counters and to provide preprocessed data.
Given that, is there a need for a high-speed interface for a
huge amount of unprocessed statistical data?
However, the user interface is a just one building brick,
which can be enhanced or replaced with moderate effort, if
there is a need.

Debugfs file are fine for larger structures.
Unless one keeps reading statistics dozens of times per second,
I don't see an issue with that.
The question is: what are the requirements to be covered?

Both, the statistics infrastructure on behalf of its exploiters as well
as the exploiters of the taskstats interface do data preprocessing,
that is, maintain counters in the kernel.
User space counters won't perform, of course.
AFAICS, actual differences are:
- triggers for data delivery to user space
   (statistics infrastructure: when user reads statistics through file,
    taskstats: on certain task related events, right?)
- and, therewith, frequency of data delivery to user space
