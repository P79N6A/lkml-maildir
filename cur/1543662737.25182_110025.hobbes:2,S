           Summary: system hangs until keyrpress
    Kernel Version: 2.5.61
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org

Distribution: debian unstable/custom

compaq armada m700 mobile p3 with maestro 2e, 64 megs of ram.
Software Environment:
kernel 2.5.61 (having the same problem since 2.5.56+), gcc 3.2 and other
utils from debian/unstable.
Problem Description:
The machine locks up until an interrupt is received from keyboard.. the
mouse moves, display is frozen (xmms title stops rotating).network traffic
is received (i get a bunch of text after i press a key from irc). this
problem exists only when xmms is playing (oss emulation with alsa). after i
close xmms the hangup never occures. if playing mp3s with mpg123 everything
works.
Nasty bugs.. contact me for more information
