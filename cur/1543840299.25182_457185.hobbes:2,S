I don't believe so from the patches.

I must have missed where it handles that.

Ok my example isn't quite right - I can create the pipes and do the
blocking in other patterns to get the result I mean. The problem is that
I can be blocked in a driver write() method before you raise the
security level and no change at the VFS level will be early enough to
stop it.
Another example would be
Type ^S
	thread #1
		write(console, padding, internalbuffersize);
		write(console, secret_buffer, data) [blocks]
	thread #2
		sleep to be sure #1 is blocked
		open secret file
		read(secret, secret_buffer, data);
Type ^Q
By the time you raise the security level due to the action of thread #2
I'm already blocked in tty_do_write() and have passed any vfs checks.

The core is the same, the question of specifically what you revoke is
different.
