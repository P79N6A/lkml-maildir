mmap for db file seems to be slower. For basic db hash usage and raw speed
nothing seems to touch tdb (Tridge's db hack). Its also portable code which
is important since the tool has to be built on the compiling host.
Personally I've always considered make dep good enough. Its trying to solve
the extra .5% that probably can be solved by careful use of make clean when
CML realises a critical rule changed (SMP etc)
