In that case I suggest you check the Linux Kernel archives again. The
CITI folks have been working on this for at least 2 years now. There
are beta versions both for Linux, and BSD, and the former has indeed
been announced both on this list and on the Linux Fsdevel list.
IIRC, the GPLed version was in fact pretty much of a necessity in
order to get the IETF to consider NFSv4 as an internet standard: for
that you need at least 2 independent implementations (SunOS + Linux
are the showcases)
Cheers,
