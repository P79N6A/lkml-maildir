Okay, I'm going bald even faster than usual.
I've just received a new computer based on a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 with
hyper-threading enabled. Yes, HT is enabled in the BIOS; yes, /proc/cpuinfo
shows the 'ht' flag; yes, I've compiled 2.4.20 (stock) with SMP and ACPI
enabled.
No, it doesn't work. cat /proc/cpuinfo reports a single CPU.
I've also tried a 2.5.51 kernel -- and it, indeed, does find "both"
processors, listing them in cpuinfo as siblings. Looking at the boot logs,
2.5.51 seems to work just fien with my CPU.
For many reasons, I'd prefer to be running the 2.4.20 kernel (if nothing
else, I'm having trouble getting loadable modules -- the nVidia drivers for
one -- to work on 2.5.51.)
Can 2.4.20 handle a Pentium 4 (not Xeon, mind you) with HT? What could I be
missing in my kernel build?
What is especially frustrating is that the factory-installed Windows XP had
no trouble at all using the HT-enable P4 (until I sent WinXP to the great
bit-bucket in the sky).
Thanks in advance.
