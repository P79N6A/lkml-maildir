elvtune is long dead :-)
it's not tweakable right now, but if you wish to experiment you just
need to add a line to ide-disk.c:idedisk_setup() - pseudo patch:
+	blk_queue_max_sectors(drive->queue, 32);
+
	printk("%s: max request size: %dKiB\n", drive->name, drive->queue->max_sectors / 2);
	/* Extract geometry if we did not already have one for the drive */
above will limit max request to 16kb, experiment as you see fit.
