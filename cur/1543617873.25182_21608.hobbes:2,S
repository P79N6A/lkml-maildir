I opened the box, and yes the NIC was in PCI slot 3. I moved it to slot
1 and I'll patch up the bad blocks on that drive and see if it happens
again. 
Of course it took several months this time, and it's likely I'll be
upgrading that machine to 2.4. So the new drivers in 2.4 might handle
the buggy chipset.
