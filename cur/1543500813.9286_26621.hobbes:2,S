There's a webdav module for apache. It works quite well.
I _am_ dubious about the IE5 'WebFolders' thing, which essentially
implements a network file-system over HTTP. I think HTTP is already
pretty heavily abused and overloaded.
Of course, it can be argued that the basic set of filesystem operations
is (very loosely) semantically equivalent to the basic HTTP ops (get a
file, put a file, get information about a file, that sort of thing), and
that WebDav fills the holes with rename, delete and such.
It doesn't stop me being more and more dubious about it. Outlook now
reads mail off some servers through HTTP/WebDav (but adding custom
methods that are _like_ but not the _same_ as the DAV ones). Don't try
to convince me that that is a good idea.
If everything cheerfully whizzes through HTTP without clear URI
namespacing, it becomes VERY hard for an administrator to monitor,
analyze, and (if necessary) restrict traffic.
