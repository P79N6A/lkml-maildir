Integrating the U-Boot mkimage into the kernel would be a great thing
for us Embedded folks (U-Boot supports most interesting platforms these
days), but I don't like your way to provide a script wrapper around the
"real" mkimage; I'm not sure what the maintainers think about this but I
would prefer a "native" mkuimage.c -> mkuimage.
