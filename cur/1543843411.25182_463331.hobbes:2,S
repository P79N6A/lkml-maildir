that is not at all the reason! The reason is that we want to find 
deadlocks _as early as mathematically possible_ (in a running system, 
where locking patterns are observed). That is we want to gather the 
_most generic_ locking rules.
For example, if there are lock_1A, lock_1B of the same lock class, and 
lock_2A and lock_2B of another lock class. If we observed the following 
usage patterns:
	acquire(lock_1A);
	acquire(lock_2A);
	release(lock_2A);
	release(lock_1A);
and another piece of kernel code did:
	acquire(lock_2B);
	acquire(lock_1B);
	release(lock_1B);
	release(lock_1B);
with per-lock rules there's no problem detected, because the 4 locks are 
independent and we only observed a 1A->2A and a 2B->1B dependency.
But with per-class rule gather we'd observe the 1->2 and the 2->1 
dependency, and we'd warn that there's a deadlock.
So we want to create as broad, as generic rules as possible, to catch 
deadlocks as soon as it's _provable_ that they could occur. In that 
sense lockdep wants to have a '100% proof' of correctness: the first 
time a bad even happens we flag it.
