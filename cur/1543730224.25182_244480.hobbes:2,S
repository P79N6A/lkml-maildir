Kevin, I suspect the oops you're seeing is due to the problem mentioned
here (add_pin_to_irq() is __init but shouldn't be):

Can you try Randy's patch without using "pci=routeirq" and see whether
it resolves the oops?  Of course, the nvidia driver still won't work
because it's looking at pci_dev->irq before calling pci_enable_device(),
but that's a separate issue.
