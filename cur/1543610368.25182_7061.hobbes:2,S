There is absolutely no code in e2fsprogs to create that file on an
unmounted filesystem.  The only mention of the ".journal" name in
e2fsprogs-1.23 is in the code where it opens a regular file with that
name using normal syscalls to access mounted filesystems.  A
".journal" file might be an artifact resulting from doing a recursive
copy from an online-upgraded ext3 filesystem to the new one, though.

The .journal is an immutable file.  Root will get -EPERM.

Just clearing the "has_journal" flag from an online-upgraded
filesystem won't be enough to delete the .journal file.  
"dumpe2fs" will tell you what inode the filesystem is actually using
for the journal: I suspect it won't be using that .journal file.
Cheers,
 Stephen
