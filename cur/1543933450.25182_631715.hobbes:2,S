Linus, please revert fbdcf18df73758, as requested by Yanmin. It was 
noticed before (by Yinghai Lu) that this commit was not needed, but it 
looked a harmless duplication and we incorrectly thought it's only a NOP 
and wanted to fix it in v2.6.25 - but as Yanmin has analyzed it now, it 
creates a sub-optimal sched-domains hierarchy (not setting up the domain 
belonging to the core) when CONFIG_X86_HT=y.
