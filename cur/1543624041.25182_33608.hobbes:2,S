The process calling this is kernel thread doing powermangment; we have
it under full control. yield() is probably more intuitive, through.

Wake from S3 or S4 should look like power-up from disks perspective. I
should need no commands to do that.
Restoring right UDMA mode... Well, I'll need to do that,
probably. (What I have there is just enough to prevent disk
corruption. I'm still likely to see some bus resets, but no longer
data loose, I believe.)

The while loop above should make sure no command is happening just
now, right?

Disks that need cache flush are broken, anyway -- they lied us on
command completion -- right?

Why should I tell the drive to power down? It is going to loose its
power, anyway (I believe in both S3 and S4).

S4BIOS is not on my list just now; agreed it would be better.
