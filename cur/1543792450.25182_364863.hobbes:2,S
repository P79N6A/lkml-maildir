In my opinion there is no reason to change the current implementation for SAKS3/0.
Note: if someone reads LDT via [sys_]modify_ldt(), he will receive the requested
data in "processor format", that is LDT-descriptors. He will receive a list of
descriptors starting at the first descriptor of the LDT, thus no entry number is
needed in the enties.
The only case that uses user_desc is when writing one desriptor via modify_ldt().
modify_ldt(WRITE) exactly writes one LDT-descriptor, so user_desc must contain
the number of the entry to write. Thus user_desc is bigger than LDT descriptor.
It also uses an other data layout resulting in double the size of LDT-descriptor.
So I think it doesn't make sense to store user_desc. We save memory storing the
resulting LDT-descriptors, which then are copied transparently on modify_ldt(READ).
Conversion between user_desc and LDT-entry is done on modify_ldt(WRITE) in SKAS0
only. No other conversions are done in UML.
