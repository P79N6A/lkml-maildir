After a bit posting at comp.sys.sun.hardware I found a person with an 
Ultra60 using Creator3D (UPA) too on it, he had a working X. He did run 
kernel 2.6.8, so today I did install 2.6.8.1 (vanilla) and tested Xorg 
and it worked as well as it does under 2.4.x.
I guess there has been some bad change in the sparc kernel code somewhere 
between 2.6.8.1 and 2.6.13. I can say that 2.6.15.1 still "crashes" the 
kernel. I don't know if there has been any discussion if it's the small 
amount of UPA relatad code that causes the problem or not, but I think 
it's plausible that the UPA code has been "damaged" in the later versions 
of the kernel.
