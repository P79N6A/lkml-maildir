Subject: sendfile64() on x86_64 breaks at 2gb (MAX_NON_LFS limit)

for the opteron, the value of MAX_NON_LFS (include/linux/fs.h) is fixed 
at (1UL<<31 -1).
Since ALL 64 bit boxes force O_LARGEFILE on, shouldn't this value be 
(1UL<<63 -1) so that
sendfile64() will proceed beyond the 2gb limit?
under 2.6.6, sendfile64() has no __NR_sendfile64 entry in asm*/unistd.h 
(same for 2.6.9-rc2)
so the syscall sendfile64() maps to sendfile(), which has MAX_NON_LFS 
hard coded in fs/read_write.c
as its limit, rather than 0ULL as in sendfile64().
So the fix is to make the correct entry for sendfile64 in unistd.h (note 
that this hoses /usr/include/.../syscalls.h :-)
and update fs.h as folows:
--- fs.h.old    2004-09-23 11:44:33.469481466 -0500
+++ fs.h        2004-09-23 11:29:56.823712018 -0500
