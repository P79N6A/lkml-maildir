I suspect it dates back to gcc-3.1 days. It's from 2004. And the author of 
that comment is a part-time gcc hacker who was probably offended by the 
fact that we thought (correctly) that a lot of gcc inlining was totally 
broken.
Since he was the main alpha maintainer, he got to do things his way 
there..
