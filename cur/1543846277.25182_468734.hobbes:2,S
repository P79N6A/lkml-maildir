Right; we need to get this settled and we need to figure out a way with
Wireless Extensions to allow exact SSIDs to be sent and retrieved from
the card/driver.  How much cruft do we add to drivers and/or WE bits to
bend over backwards and preserve compatibility with a lot of older bits?
I can think of a few ways here to preserve backwards compat, but most
involve adding bits to 3 places in each driver and a new flag to WE,
which puts us right back in the same situation we're in right now;
inconsistent drivers and poor semantics both inside and outside the
kernel.
Maybe the answer here _is_ to bend over backwards to preserve
compatibility, restore null-termination-and-increment-length bits in
drivers and WE, and kludge all the user-space tools.  Then just Do The
Right Thing with nl80211/cfg80211 (whenever they come around) and fix
stuff up in the nl80211 WE compat layer.  I don't know.  But nl80211
isn't here yet, and it's unclear when it will be.
