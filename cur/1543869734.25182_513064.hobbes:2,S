Personally i would prefer to put the metadata-part as a file inside another filesystem.
- The files can shrink and grow as needed
- If you have several Partitions like that you don't have that much overhead because of fixed size metadata
For e.g. I have 41 external HDDs (11TB, currently with XFS), when i could split the metadata from the actual data.
And when it would be possible to mount the metadata without it's data i would gain the following niceties.
- I could gather all metadata in one place
- No "overhead" for filesystem on the external HDDs just "pure" data.
- They would be searchable, at least on the metadata level, so i could search something and then connect the needed HDD for full access.
In my case the metadata overhead should be quite small as the smallest file is about 400MB and range up to 5GB. For e.g. i have HDDs which are full by only about 90 files.
The file are mostly write-once, so the current overhead for dualfs would be 'extreme' for my case.
AFAIR the overhead of XFS (with log reduced to near minimum) was about 4-5MB in total for a 200GB HDD. But i'm currently at work so i can't verify that.
