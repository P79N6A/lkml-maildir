Hey,
         am porting V4L2 drivers from 2.6.13 to 2.6.20.
     The driver is using a  structure 'video_device' which exists in
include/linux/videodev.h.
     However, The linux kernel in 2.6.20 doesnot have that structure?.
      Has the architecture changed between 2.6.13 to 2.6.20 for V4L2?.
      Regards,
       Jo
