Would int16_t and int32_t work? Those int's were in there before I started
working on it. __u16 and __u32 are Linux kernel defines that aren't always there
in user space.
I would much rather have one h file than two. When we had two the variable and
structure names, comments, etc had drifted over the years until they didn't even
look like the same file anymore. drm.h only defines the ioctls, no internal
kernel structures are exposed.
