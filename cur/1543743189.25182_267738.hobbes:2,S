That's pretty much what I was proposing, actually ;) I never meant three
different variables. The discussion was about having all files
read-write or not. I usually have only the first file read-write and
others read-only mirrors thereof, but sometimes people don't like that
arbitrary symmetry breakage and go for read-write mirrors. You choose.

Agreed.

Well, the adm1026 driver is a complex driver which never received testing
and reviewing so far, because it is so rarely found on motherboards.
It's perfectly normal that it takes a couple revisions and discussion
to get it in good shape. Thanks for the good work so far.
