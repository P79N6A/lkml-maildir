But if we couldn't release the (fixed) source, then what is the point? 
If it is not open source, why should Alan or I or anyone care to debug
it?
What we want is for users to not have a tainted kernel, so we can debug
the problem and release the results.  We are interested in fixing our (=
the open source community's) problems, not others.
