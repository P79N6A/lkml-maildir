Nope.
1) The _raw_spin_lock family is used everywhere in the kernel.  Why the
arbitrary special rule for _raw_read_lock??????  It makes no sense.
2) The _raw versions are intended to be used in places where it is
known that preemption is already disabled, so that the overhead of
re-disabling/enabling it can be avoided.
