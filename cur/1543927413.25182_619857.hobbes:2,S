Andrew Morton saw a similar thing and proposed
-	. = GATE_ADDR + 0x500;
+	. = GATE_ADDR + 0x600;
in gate.lds.S ... which does appear to work around the problem.
Peter Chubb dug into this a lot deeper and found the problem
only occurs with certain cross compilation environments.  See
his thoughts here:

Your config built just fine for me using a native 3.4.6 version
of gcc.
