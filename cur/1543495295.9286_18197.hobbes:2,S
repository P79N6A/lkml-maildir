Hello!
We have a server that goes down once every couple of weeks with an error
messages:
Problem:  Block on freelist xxxxxxxx isn't free.
We are running the stock 2.0.36 kernel from RedHat 5.2.  The server has
128MB of RAM.  The CPU is an AMD K6-2/300.  It has a DEC Tulip 21140
based network card.  The server runs apache, radius, logins (telnet) and
mail.
Does anyone have any ideas on how to track the problem down?  Is there a
fix?  I've searched the kernel mailing lists and this problem is discussed
but I can't find any answers.
