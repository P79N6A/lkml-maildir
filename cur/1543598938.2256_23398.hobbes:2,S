You can you choose this when you make the filesystem..
By using the -m option to mke2fs you can set the
reserved-block-percentage ... and can eay overide this then to 0 or 3
percent...
       -m reserved-blocks-percentage
              Specify the percentage of reserved blocks for the super-user.  This value defaults to 5%.
afaik, the 5% option is a mke2fs default for all distributions.
