Just like you want to run those special threads outside of any
container, some sysadmin might be interested in running different
processes that they don't want to bind to any container limits.
I think it is critical that you provide the capability to have tasks
running outside any container. Whether sysadmin wants to do it or not
for a system is a different thing.
