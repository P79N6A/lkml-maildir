You don't and it's not necessary. You use the module's ioctl() function
(which you define) to take data from a user-mode program when you want
to start the module.
	Trivial case:       
cprogram()
{
        system("insmod my_module");
	fd = open("/my/device", O_WHATEVER);
        ioctl(fd, INSERT_MY_DATA, buffer);
	ioctl(fd, TEST_MY_DEVICE, &results);
	close(fd);
}
Cheers,
