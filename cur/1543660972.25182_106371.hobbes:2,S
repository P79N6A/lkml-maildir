Oops. See below, Config.in patch disappeared when patch was travelling

What about using matroxset to set things up? It was always mandatory to
use matroxset to set fb<->outputs relation, and now just default changed
because of there is more people who want same picture on both outputs
than people who want different outputs... And with introducing DVI support
there was no other sane alternative.

  Alan missed this chunk when sending you matroxfb updates and I did not
notice. Please apply...
