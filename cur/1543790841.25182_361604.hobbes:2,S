Sorry, I realize in retrospect that my post may have been misleading. I
was only commenting that I was seeing the same messages (but not the
same "Kernel panic - not syncing: PCI-DMA: high address but no IOMMU.")
So it works with either IOMMU_DEBUG (which I guess forces the IOMMU on?
-- hence the output of "PCI-DMA: More than 4GB of RAM and no IOMMU"?) or
not. Also note that I only have 2 GB of RAM, so I believe the kernel
made the right decision in disabling the IOMMU (which is used with more
than 3 GB of RAM?) Still, if Michael has IOMMU_DEBUG enabled, it might
change things.
Thanks,
Nish
