If the LEDs are connected to the controller on the motherboard,
then they are a strict indication of activity over the cable
between the drive and controller (if they function at all).
But it is possible for software to leave those LEDs permanently
in the "on" state, depending on the register sequence used.
If the LEDs are on the drive itself, they may indicate transfers
over the connector (cable) -- usually always the case -- or they
could indicate transfers to/from the media.
