Bill, I have CC'ed your message without modification because Con is
not subscribed to the list. Even for people who are subscribed, the
convention on lkml is to reply to all.
Anyway, the "no SMT" run is with CONFIG_SCHED_SMT turned off, P4 HT
is still on. This was my fault because I didn't specify clearly that
I wanted to see a run with hardware HT turned off, although these
numbers are still interesting.
Con hasn't tried HT off AFAIK because we couldn't work out how to
turn it off at boot time! :(
