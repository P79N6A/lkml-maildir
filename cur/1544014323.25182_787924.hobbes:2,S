As you sent them to me on December 24 and 25, it's a bit hard to get
some good testing in -next for them (especially as I was on vacation for
2 weeks...)  One of them is just documentation, that will be easy to
send in after -rc1 is out.  The other I need to review, as it adds
additional functionality.
Moral of the story?  Send patches to me earlier :)
