No. It is a hard-to-see, but real situation.

The kernel may also have that problem and solves it the
not-exactly-right way -- by unleashing the OOM killer. But FUSE won't
unleash the OOM killer -- it will deadlock the swapper, because the
swapper waits for the fuse process and the fuse process won't run until
the swapper cleans some pages. Because the swapper does not know, that
trying to writeout pages is futile since this request is from writeout
path. It does know in the in-kernel case.
