when i do the following:
1: get a brand new 25pack box.
2: burn with my 2.6.11-rc1-bk9, and it fails
3: boot 2.6.9-rc1 and -rc4, and it works perfectly
i find it extremely unlikely that the dvd's (of the same pack) i try on
a newer kernel than 2.6.9-rcX just happens to be the faulty ones..
especially since other persons report aswell..
