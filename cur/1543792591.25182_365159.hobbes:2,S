Subject: [AMD64] Possible bug in fs/read_write.c::rw_verify_area

Hi all,
fs/read_write.c::rw_verify_area check if the count for a read/write is
valid.  Unfortunately, this check assume that a size_t is an int, which
is wrong at least on AMD64 architecture.
This fix is not correct also in general: it is wrong to assume
that size_t is a long int.  A correct fix would be to introduce
a new constant (say SSIZE_MAX) for each supported architecture
and to use that contstant instead.  I'm not an expert on this and
it is why I don't do it (sorry).  But at least the following patch
is ok for more achitecture, I believe.
