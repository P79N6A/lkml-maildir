thanks a lot for your reply
But is it at all possible to put data into page cache without going through the inodes or files? I mean, for example, if you are given a string "abcde", and you want to allocate a page to store this "abcde" into that page and add that page to the page cache, what would you do? 
2)The ramfs uses the generic file operation
