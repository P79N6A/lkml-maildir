There is one danger with unnecessary
	current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
lines.
If it's executed in an interrupt or bottom half handler it can corrupt
the runqueue.
In schedule():
* goto recalculate
* interrupts reenabled, bottom half handler might run
* interrupts disabled
* goto repeat_schedule;
* prev->state==TASK_RUNNING --> goto still_running.
And now a process that's not on the runqueue might be choosen for
execution, and the next del_from_runqueue() corrupts the runqueue.
