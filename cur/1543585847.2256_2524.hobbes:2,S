Ok, this BUG is there to catch people trying to use the reiserfs journal
without the BKL held.  Older ac series kernel had a bug where vmtruncate
would trigger this when called from generic_file_write (which your stack
trace shows you hit).
But, ac20 should have the fix.  Looks like only the expanding truncate case
ended up under the BKL in vmtruncate.  This untested diff is stolen from the
expanding truncate fix in ac25:
