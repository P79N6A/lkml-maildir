What if you booted an all-Madison system, and then hot-plugged some
Montecitos later?  Either we'd need the hotplug cpu code to run through
this routine again to re-test whether any cpu has multi-thread support
(it doesn't look like it does that now).
Or perhaps it would be simpler to dispense with this test and always
call sysfs_create_file() here (still inside CONFIG_SCHED_SMT) so that
the hook is always present to tune the scheduler (even if it may be
ineffective on a no-smt system)?
