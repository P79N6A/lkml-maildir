You could have two (or more) schedulers. However, this would not replicate
nor even emulate two CPUs. A single CPU can only do one thing at any
instant. Two or more CPUs can do as many things as there are CPUs. Some
shared resources have to be single-threaded with SMP, but otherwise
a lot of activity can be done in parallel.
