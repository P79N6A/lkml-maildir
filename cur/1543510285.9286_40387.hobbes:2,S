> I wonder about the BLKRRPART. Is this necessary?
Not really. That is, I added it to get a call of
invalidate_inodes(), but of course you also get
that upon umount. So, if you never forget to umount
before ejecting, or if your eject program does the
umount itself, then BLKRRPART is superfluous,
provided you do BLKFLSBUF.

[On the other hand, if you do BLKRRPART, then BLKFLSBUF
is superfluous.]
