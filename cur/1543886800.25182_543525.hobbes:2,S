I'm not sure what you mean.
We use this function (ie. kernel/power/process.c:is_user_space()) to
distinguish kernel threads from user space processes.  Therefore we make it
always return true for user space processes and always return false for kernel
threads.  In the latter case we need to use the task_lock() to ensure that the
result is as desired (ie. false), because otherwise it might be racing with
either fs/aio.c:use_mm() or fs/aio.c:unuse_mm().
