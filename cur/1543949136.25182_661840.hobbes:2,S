Trond can, and I'm completely confident he will, correct me if I'm
wrong, but interoperability seems to require that you can't assume
the perfect administration scenario. If you could, the name/value
pair scheme would be perfectly viable, but Trond has very clearly
explained why it is not reasonable to assume that.
But, for early going you may get away with telling people that
the configuration has to be identical. They won't listen and will
mess it up, but you will probably get away with it.
