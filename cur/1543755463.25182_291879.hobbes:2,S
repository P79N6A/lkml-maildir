Ah. Okay. I hadn't looked that closely so that I realised the CMOS only
gives the accuracy we're using. Humble apologies. So then, I agree: it
would be best if we can move to something with greater precision and
make mileage from it. Is that an option on all x86 machines though? I
guess cmos is the lowest common denominator :<
