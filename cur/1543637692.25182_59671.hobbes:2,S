You don't have to have swap device in linux either (afaik it has never been
mandatory). Linux will run without swap just like you would expect.

Obviously, if you have heaps of free memory, linux will not usually touch
swap either. The exact point where swap starts to get used is of course a
matter of debate (and depends on vm implementation and tunables in linux).
But the point is: even if there is no immediate memory pressure, backing
pages to swap is no crime.
