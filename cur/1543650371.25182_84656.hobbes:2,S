Debug: sleeping function called from illegal context at mm/slab.c:1304
Call Trace:
 [<c0113f98>] __might_sleep+0x54/0x5c
 [<c012e342>] kmem_flagcheck+0x1e/0x50

This one comes from calling kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL in sys_poll.
bad: scheduling while atomic!

Another little tidbit. I was in X11 while this was happening, and I
happened to stop a process (nautilus) just before I looked in my logs
about this ... and caught a "Notice: process nautilus exited with
preempt_count 2". So my guess is somewhere between -mm5 and -mm6 we
screwed up the atomicity count. (Funny I didn't see that for more
processes, though.)
