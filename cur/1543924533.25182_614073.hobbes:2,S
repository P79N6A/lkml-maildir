Subject: duplicate device name print out by dev_xxxx

All,
I found in recent kernel that dev_xxxx() macros will print out duplicate
device name, which is a bit ugly. And this is true at least for platform_device.
The reason is due to dev_printk() printing out both dev_driver_string(dev)
and (dev)->bus_id, the latter is assigned with the same driver name
for a platform_device.
Any idea on this?
