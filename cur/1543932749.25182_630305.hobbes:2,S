To all,
The next few forwarded messages comprise my responses to Greg's
questions about the patch I submitted to deal with pci devices
that do not respond correctly to x86 mmconf accesses.
Please accept my apologies for not having including the community
in my original responses.

Yes, of course. I missed that. Thank you.
Should I resubmit that one patch? Or would you prefer I resubmit
the whole patch set?
