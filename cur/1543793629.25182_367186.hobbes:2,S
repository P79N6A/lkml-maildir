It has been asked couple of times before in this context and no one cared to
answer:
Using 4k stacks may have advantages, but what compelling reasons are there
to drop the choice of 4k/8k stacks? You can make 4k stacks default, but why
throw away the option of 8k stacks, especially since the impact of this
option on the kernel implementation is very little?
