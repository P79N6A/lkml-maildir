Filesystem level may not be the best level to do it at, but doing it
at all is still better than current state-of-the-art. Doing it at
media level is not enough, because then you get interference at IDE
cable or driver bugs etc.
DM layer might be better place to do checksums at, but perhaps
filesystem can do it more efficiently (it knows its own access
patterns), and is definitely easier to setup for the end user.
If you want compression anyway (and you want -- for performance
reasons, if you are working with big texts or geographical data),
doing checksums at the same level just makes sense.
