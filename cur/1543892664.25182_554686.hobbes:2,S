"Mummy if I deliberately shoot myself in the head it hurts"
Distro's don't ship in C locale and haven't for years. And the worst case
effect you can engineer by trying is to display some slightly odd symbols
(And incidentially since the Linux fs has been defined to be utf-8 for
naming for many years you'll find the same problem using "ls")

"Require" is a rather strong word for a print formatting issue specific
to obscure setups.
