The line terminator, '\n', is what terminates the interpreter.  White
space (in this case, only ' ' and '\t') is used to seperate the
arguments to the interpreter.  This allows scripts to pass args to
intepreters, as in #!/usr/bin/per -w or #!/usr/bin/env perl -w
So is '\r' a line terminator? For Linux, no.  Should '\r' seperate
arguments?  No, that would be very strange.
