Thank you. I just upgraded to version 3.3.3 from the unstable tree... 
and it works!
Now, there is only one warning left. When a module is compiled I get 
something like this (for all modules!):
CC [M]  arch/alpha/kernel/srm_env.o
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:5: Warning: setting incorrect section attributes for 
.got
Any idea about that?
Stefan.
