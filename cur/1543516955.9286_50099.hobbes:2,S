Yes, I see the race condition now. However, I still feel my patch is
correct (in theory) and what is also needed with it, is a some kind of user
space lock (a lock file, for example).

Ok, this is as good solution as my patch, in practise. In theory, though, I
find it strange that modules marked "(autoclean)" are not autocleaned if
they happen to be also "(unused)" -- for whatever reason.
I had this situation a while ago, but I don't know/remember why. Right now
I cannot think about any legitimate reason for unused modules.
