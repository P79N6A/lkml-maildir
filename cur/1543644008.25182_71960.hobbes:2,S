Yes, and that's the way it's set up: we check if the device has a driver 
before we bind to it. However, dev->driver doesn't get set before the 
device is registered with the core for PCI devices. That's fixed easily 
enough. 
But, I'm a bit confused on where this is happening. The PCI layer will 
probe for devices before any drivers are registered. The drivers are 
registered, then they're attached to devices that were already discovered. 
So, how are they getting init'ed twice?
