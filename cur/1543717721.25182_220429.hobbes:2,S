Magic group has better safety property, but it evolved from
disable_cap_mlock which for CAP_IPC_LOCK has the identical property to
this patch.  Agreed it's safer w/out, but the magic group is so special
purpose that it feels like a hack.  This patch is more contained and
IMO is just a hold over until we have something that really works.
