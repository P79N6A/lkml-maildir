Subject: [patch -mm] s390: remove s390 touch_nmi_watchdog() define
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Remove s390 touch_nmi_watchdog() define to avoid compile warnings.
touch_nmi_watchdog() got converted to touch_softlockup_watchdog() which
in case of !CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP is also a nop, just like we want it
on s390.
