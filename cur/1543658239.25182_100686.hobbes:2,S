Sure, I like that, but LOG_BUF_LEN must be a power of 2 (currently)
and I was trying not to rewrite that circular buffer code, that's all.
However, I will if that's desirable.
And kconfig doesn't have a way to enforce the selected value...
I asked Roman about 2-3 weeks ago about some way to enforce ranges on
config values, e.g. (but that wouldn't affect powers of 2).
Linus also told me that he's not crazy about this change.
I just want the LOG_BUF_LEN available outside of kernel/printk.c...
