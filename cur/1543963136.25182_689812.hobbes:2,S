Hi Grant,
you understand I use of_device, of_platform and prom_parse. If you do diff
between them they will almost the same. One small difference is in prom.c file.
I hope we will move these files to drivers/of.
This is not only question to me.
Paul, Steve and David: Can I moved these three files to drivers/of?
