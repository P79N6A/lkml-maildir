Diffusion can be a slow and erratic process, resulting in "bugs."  "The ELF
standard" (there have been different versions) was not widely available,
and/or not widely consulted, for some parts of its lifetime.
Also, the standard contains some generalizations that were not common usage;
common usage was [is] .text < .data < .bss, with single pieces of each.
