Yes, AFAIK :)
I will try to follow Arjan's recommendations on using his functions
instead of obsd ones, even if I think it should be alone in the current
file.
Also I will split up the patch.
I will do it as soon as I get time for it, I need first to work out a
cleaner vsec (no more code in headers and such) and also a sys_chroot()
hook that I requested yesterday on the bugzilla, among the SELinux 2.4
backport which needs several fixes due to last 2.6 bk-commits reports.
Thanks for the comments,
Cheers.
