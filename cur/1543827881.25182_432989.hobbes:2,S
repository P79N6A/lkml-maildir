The user address space size on x86-64 is final (baring the architecture gets extended
to beyond 48bit VA). We already use all positive
space. But the vsyscalls don't even live in user address space.

Ok i can change it to unsigned if you feel that strongly about it.

Yes of course.

I think if the same CPU gets unplugged and replugged it should
get the same number. Otherwise new numbers should be allocated.

Alan suggested adding some padding which probably
makes sense, although I frankly don't see the implementation
changing.  Variable length would be clear overkill and I refuse
to overdesign this.

Why is it a problem? It's just var __thread isn't it?

Hmm, I thought user space could define arbitary own __threads. I certainly
used that in some of my code. Why is it a problem for the libc to do the same?
Anyways even if it's such a big problem you can put it all in
one chunk and partition it yourself given the fixed size. I don't think
the kernel code should concern itself about this.
