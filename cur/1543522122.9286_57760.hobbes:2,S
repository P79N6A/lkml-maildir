   i'm not sure this is a good idea (from include/asm-sparc/unistd.h):
 ...
   can i have these back please?  :)
Why?  The system call tables for sunos have the appropriate
entries, and the 32-bit sparc/linux syscall table has the
correct ones too.
It's ok to do this, properly functioning applications for
both OSs will work just fine.
