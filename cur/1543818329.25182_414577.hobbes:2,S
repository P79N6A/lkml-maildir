This is something we've been discussing - whether to use a single
"container" structure pointing to all the namespaces, or put everything
into the task_struct.  Using container structs means more cache misses
and refcounting issues, but keeps task_struct smaller as you point out.
The consensus so far has been to start putting things into task_struct
and move if needed.  At least the performance numbers show that so far
there is no impact.
iirc container patches have been sent before.  Should those be resent,
then, and perhaps this patchset rebased on those?
thanks,
