	I have access to another one of those cards at work it reports
	the same items in the dmesg ,  I just looked at the switch it is
	attached to & it shows fine(*) .  That switch manufacturer is an
	old Cabletron SSR4000 .  But the thruput there is even worse (**).
	THO the ssr4k network isn't idle .  And I am unable to aportion a
	time to make it idle .  The previous emails test network was idle .
	After I get back from a road trip next week I'll try a back to
	back test .  At least I hope I can when I get back .  Twyl ,  JimL
