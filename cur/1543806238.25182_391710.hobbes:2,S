If you prelink your system, shared library randomization (of those
libraries that were prelinked) ceases: but the stack is still
randomized. If you prelink with -R, prelink uses random addresses,
which is pretty much as good as using ASLR, but faster and more
memory-efficient :)
I don't know of any specific knob, nor of a way to turn off stack
randomization but leave mmap(PROT_EXEC) randomization on.
