According to Simon Kirby:

Oh yes this looks veerrry similar to what I am seeing. If you check out
the eepro100 mailing list archive you'll see that a lot of people are
in the same boat.

There's your problem. It seems that the eepro100 (and the tulip and
the epic100) drivers lock up under load especially when memory gets tight.
If you check out the threads of the last week about "bug in tulip_rx"
you'll see that a lot of Donald's drivers seem to share the same
problem and that it is reasonably easily solved.
For the eepro100, a pointer to an updated driver was posted here 2
days ago by Savochkin Andrey Vladimirovich <saw@msu.ru> with subject
"Re: NFS Client in 2.2.13   (eepro100 problem)". His driver is at
ftp://ftp.nc.orc.ru/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/eepro100.c

I've been using this driver since saturday. I used to get a lockup
every two hours, with this driver I haven't had _any_ lockups in
two days (and still counting).
Here's the patch you need to use the driver with 2.2.x :

First things first, but not necessarily in that order.
