Yes, that was the point.

dpll_data is used for other DPLL register settings (such as autoidle and 
mode setting), so we should probably leave dpll_data as-is.  Your proposed 
fix in your subsequent message sounds good (viz., adding a separate static 
omap3_dpll4_set_rate() function).

Indeed, the return value should be passed along to the caller.  The 
previous check does, however, prevent the DPLL4 registers from being 
written on 3430ES1.
From your subsequent message, it sounds like you've merged a version of 
this patch with your proposed fixes.  Please let me know if you'd 
like me to send an updated version of this patch anyway.
