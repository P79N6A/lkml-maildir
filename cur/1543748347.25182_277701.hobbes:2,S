Eh, I'd like to not to be dependent on event accuracy/frequency. Lets
see if we can do it w/o scheduling events.

Well, its not *that* bad. Similar to the ntp_scale() function, it would
look something like:
if (interval <= offset_len)
	return (interval * singleshot_mult)>>shift;
else {
	cycle_t v1,v2;
	v1 = (offset_len * singleshot_mult)>>shift;
	v2 = (interval-offset_len)*adjusted_mult)>>shift;
	return v1+v2;
}
Where:
	singleshot_mult = original_mult + ntp_adj + ss_mult
and
	adjusted_mult = original_mult + ntp_adj

:) Any added NTP knowledge would be great to add to the pool.
