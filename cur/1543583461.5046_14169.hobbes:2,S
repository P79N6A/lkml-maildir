	I am seeing the following error after my machine has been up
	for a while.  My eth0 is connected to a switched, local
	subnet.  There is not a lot of traffic on the interface, maybe
	a few 100 Mbytes or so.  Taking the interface down and then up
	again fixes the problem (until it happens again :)
	Here is the relevant section from my kernel log

Mar  1 10:48:44 tela kernel: eth0: Resetting the Tx ring pointer.
	Then a similar dump repeats until the interface is recycled.
	It appears that the interface was not functioning for some
	hours before the message was generated, and it was my attempt
	to ping a host on the local subnet that caused the NETDEV
	WATCHDOG error to be generated (e.g. the card locked up, but
	the kernel didn't notice until I tried to send something on
	the wire).
	The card is:
	eth0: 3Com PCI 3c900 Boomerang 10Mbps Combo at 0x1400,
	00:60:08:bd:ab:0e, IRQ 9
	I am running kernel 2.4.2, and have seen this error in 2.4.1
	as well; not sure about 2.4.0.  I do not ever recall
	encountering this error with the 2.2.x kernels, though my
	network topology has changed, but not my hardware.  I know of
	at least one other person who gets this same error with a
	eth0: 3Com PCI 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx card.  The system is a
	P2-300, 128 Mb RAM, running various versions of Linux very
	happily for 3 years.
	FWIW, IRQ 9 is shared with the bttv module, though the network
	lockup doesn't seem to be related to my use of that module.  I
	was using xawtv last night while the interface was stil active
	and functioning.  The lockup happened this morning.
	Sorry for the long-winded post.  Is this a known bug?
	Anything I can do to help track it down and squash it if so?
