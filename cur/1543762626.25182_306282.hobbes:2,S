I took a quick look an a here's a few comments:
 - I don't think renaming mptscsih.c to mpt_core.c makes sense.
   the new name is confusing at best, and keeping the old name allows
   to keep SCCS history aswell.  That means the new SPI stub driver should
   be called mptspi or something like that.
 - please don't link mpt_core.o into both mptfch.ko and mptscsih.ko but
   make it a module of it's own
 - the new driver shoild use module_param, not MODULE_PARM
 - why does the fc driver set ioc->spi_data.mpt_pq_filter?
 - no need to forward-declare the module_init/module_exit handlers
