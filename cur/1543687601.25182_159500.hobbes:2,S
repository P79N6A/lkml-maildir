Hello
I tried to adapt an old module to the new format used
by 2.6 kernels
and i have a question about .gnu.linkonce.this_module
section.
It should contain a "module" structure from what i
understood in the
kernel sources but i can't quite figure out how can
there be a
difference of 1064 dwords between the storage location
for the init
subroutine and the storage location for the cleanup
routine.
The "module" structure itself is 96 bytes on my
machine. I have a
Pentium4 processor and linux kernel 2.6.0-test3.
How is this possible ?
Thank you
Snowdog
