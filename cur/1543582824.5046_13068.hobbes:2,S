The latest binutils in Debian potato will take either -oformat or --oformat,
IIRC.
The lastest binutils in Debian unstable (just uploaded yesterday) will only
take --oformat.  So, if you modify arch/i386/boot/Makefile to read:
	$(LD) -Ttext 0x0 -s --oformat binary -o $@ $< ...blah blah blah
you should be fine no matter which you're using...
