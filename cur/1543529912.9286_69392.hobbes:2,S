Hi,
You said:

> filesystems, but in 2.3.51 they are shown, thusly: 
this is due to the VFS changes to the bahaviour of statfs() method, namely
the unused fields used to be (for a couple of days) set to -1 and not 0 as
in ancient days. But your findings are obsolete because Al changed it back
to 0 yesterday or so:

just use 2.3.52 when it is out. Look for the phrase "/* Darn GNU df... */"
in pre-patch-2.3.52-3 to understand the reason.
