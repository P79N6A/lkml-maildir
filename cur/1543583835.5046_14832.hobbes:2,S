I'm not currently on the lkml list here, so I apologize if my cut and
past reply messes up someone's threaded mail reader.

Here is a script which will print out all the kernel configuration options
found in config.in or Config.in files.  If you put this script in the
scripts directory, run it with sh scripts/options_linux (suggested name).
It should be run from the top of the tree, e.g. /usr/src/linux.
For example, to find all the USB options,
sh scripts/options_linux | grep USB
Due to tab/space munging, I'll have to attach the script.
Hope this helps. Of course, you'll still have to get the whole kernel,
which is what you were trying to avoid in the first place. ;)
