Have you looked at this patchset - 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/65
 ?
This is the latest patchset posted last week and I haven't seen any 
comments on it.

This one has a major *cleanup* of cpufreq code including removel
of unncessary lock_cpu_hotplug() from cpufreq.

There are two approaches - Implicit hotplug callback order-based locking
as Andrew has done or keep the current cpu hotplug "lock" semantics
and just use a better lock (RCU-based) with cpu-local access in
the fast path. Gautham's patchset does the latter. lock_cpu_hotplug() is 
a misnomer, we should probably use get_cpu_hotplug() and 
put_cpu_hotplug() there.
Thanks
