here we go, the same that deadlocked 2.4.14pre5aa1 will deadlock 2.6
just now (but not latest mainline 2.4 and of course not any recent
2.4-aa)

2.6 has a sysctl that should fix it too but it's disabled by default
(which makes it useless to 99% of userbase) and it's pretty hard to be
able to attempt to tun it to a desired value.
When you get an oom killer triggering too early, or an complete oom
deadlock, I never know if this is the lowmem_reserve missing, or the oom
killer going nuts, and I've a dozen of reports of oom triggering
spurious and some oom deadlock pending. So this is certainly the first
thing I must fix.
