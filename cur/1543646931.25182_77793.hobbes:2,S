Oh yes. This is a usenet news server, 50 mbit/sec
sustained in, 100 mbit/sec sustained out, and it's all being
cached on disk. See

Right now I've not rebooted but instead I turned off swap. It
has enough memory anyway.
The 'expire' process that ran for 10 hours finished within
2 minutes, load went down from 6 to 1.8, and traffic volume
is climbing again.
I'll let it run like this for a few hours so it can catch up
with the backlog my peers have to me, then in the afternoon I'll
try 2.5.41-mm<latest> on it.
Mike.
