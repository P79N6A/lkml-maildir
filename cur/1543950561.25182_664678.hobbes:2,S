Actually, it's a dependency chain fault.  The config this was generated
from has
CONFIG_SCSI=m
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC94XX=y
the latter then forces
CONFIG_SCSI_SAS_LIBSAS=y
I think the error reported is wrong: the kernel just should have failed
to link, since both the built in aic94xx and libsas have scsi
dependencies.
We have a few other drivers in this category (like ibmvscsi).  The root
cause seems to be that SCSI_LOWLEVEL doesn't act as a tristate.  I think
a fix that will prevent all of these issues from recurring is this one.
