Goals in desired implementation sequence:
1 Standardization of pr_<level>
2 Correctness of single line uses of pr_<level>
3 Correctness of multiple line uses of printk(<level>)
4 Removal of local near equivalents of pr_<level>
5 Standardization of pr_<level> as single line only
6 Conversion of single line printk(KERN_<level> to pr_level
7 Standardize local #defines to enable/print pr_<level>
  __file__/__func__/__line__
8 Minimization/elimination of interleaved log messages
cheers, Joe
