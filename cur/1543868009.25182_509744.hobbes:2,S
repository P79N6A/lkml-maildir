the real thing is that /dev/mem is too many things for too many people.
Fundamentally it has 3 components
1) ram-but-not-kernel data: basically BIOS datastructures
2) kernel visible ram: user/kernel data, this has all the nasty cache
coherency issues. This is also a "debug only" use, and "rootkit only"
sometimes ;) 
3) MMIO space: this really should not be used anymore, sysfs provides a
MUCH better interface and it also breaks if you have enforcing IOMMU's
in the system... it can't really work since the kernel doesn't get told
which device is being accessed
unless we split this up (well the third is split already) it's going to
remain a big mess.
