Aside from this, the main issue is the "has intializer but incomplete
type" error, which indicates that the definition of struct
file_operations has not been seen by the compiler.  This seems to be
defined (in 2.4.20, at least) by include/linux/fs.h, so Raman will
need to #include that file for the initialization to work.
