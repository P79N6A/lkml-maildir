Boring....You can't have X root layer swapped to disk as it's often used
! Some quick lsof | grep "libX" gives all frontal applications 'swapping
sensible' .fuser can do 'user resource reverse'.Kernel _can_ 'appl.
resource reverse' as well.
PS: I'm not talking about inactive desktop box.Such box has to be rl 3
and is not meant to be user (geek) relevant :)
