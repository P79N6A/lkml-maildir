Subject: visor.ko freezes on dlpsh list

Summary: Handspring visor does not  fully sync with kpilot or jpilot
or with pilot-xfer.
With dlpsh, the user, and df work but it freezes with a ls command
after completing about 75% to 80% of the actually listing.
Stupid attempts to get it to work better:
I have tried different settings in the /etc/udev/rules.d and permissions.d
opening the permission wide open and making the user the full owner -
no joy.  I tried a previous visor.c from another kernel and the compiler puked
at me.
Other info:
Nothing here looks wierd:
