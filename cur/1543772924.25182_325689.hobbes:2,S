Wrong, use 23. In fact don't apply this patch; it's a dud.
Michael Schimek's vbi changes got messed up somewhere along the line.
It should be 23, not 22 as you understandably assume -- Michael included this note in his patch:
+/* mhs 2005-05-14: Properly video capturing should start in line 22,
+   but for some reason video task A will not execute without a one
+   line gap after vbi task A/B ends, if that is enabled. */
With 22, turning on ntsc closed captioning on saa7134 cards will block the video.
