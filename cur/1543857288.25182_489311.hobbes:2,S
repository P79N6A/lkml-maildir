Well we'll need to add the infrastructure to be able to do this, won't we? 
The whole point of calling flush_scheduled_work() (which we're trying to
replace/simplify) is to block the caller until it is safe to release
resources.
It might be a challenge to do this without adding more stuff to work_struct
though.
umm..  Putting a work_struct* into struct cpu_workqueue_struct and then
doing appropriate things with cpu_workqueue_struct.lock might work.
<hack, hack>
Something along these lines.  The keventd-calls-flush_work() case rather
sucks though.
