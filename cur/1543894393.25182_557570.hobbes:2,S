if you cannot modify the software that runs on your Tivo hardware you 
haven't tried very hard.
true, they don't go out of their way to make it easy, but even if they 
didn't do the integrity checking of the system it still wouldn't be easy 
to load your own software on the tivo, there's no path to load the 
software without disassembling the hardware.

I think the software is all available at www.tivo.com/linux that provides 
you all the freedom that they got.
