Hi guys,
I've already expressed my concern about using srand(1) in private e-mails.
I think it's unscientific to use one particular random sequence. Since 
no one checked if that matters, I changed srand(1) to srand(time(NULL)) 
and I'm posting my results. I don't do testing of Alan or Linus's kernels, 
but use recent Red Hat kernel. I think I've shown that it does matter.
Six quick consecutive runs of modified qs on a small set of 8 million 
integers (obviously no swap activity):
> time ./a.out 8000000
0 errors.
24.250u 0.310s 0:24.55 100.0%   0+0k 0+0io 116pf+0w
0 errors.
24.290u 0.260s 0:24.55 100.0%   0+0k 0+0io 116pf+0w
0 errors.
24.300u 0.260s 0:24.55 100.0%   0+0k 0+0io 116pf+0w
0 errors.
24.270u 0.300s 0:24.57 100.0%   0+0k 0+0io 116pf+0w
0 errors.
24.290u 0.270s 0:24.56 100.0%   0+0k 0+0io 116pf+0w
0 errors.
24.280u 0.280s 0:24.55 100.0%   0+0k 0+0io 116pf+0w
Apparently, no significant deviations in computing times.
Six runs of modified qs on a large set of 80 million integers (a lot of 
swapping!)

mean = 9m57s; standard deviation = 50s.
Apparently, the random sequence does matter (to the Rik's algorithm at 
least since it's in RH kernel).
I wonder how big the deviation is for official and AC trees.
Now Lorenzo's results seem inconclusive.
Regards,
Alexei
