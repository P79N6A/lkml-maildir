Within the context of DMA API, memory is prefetchable by the device
for "streaming" transactions but not for "coherent" memory.
PCI subsystem has no way of knowing which transaction a device
will use for any particular type of memory access. Only the
driver can embed that knowledge.

hrm...if the driver can put a safe value in cachelinesize register
and NOT enable MWI, I can imagine a significant performance boost
if the device can use MRM or MRL. But IMHO it's up to the driver
writers (or other contributors) to figure that out.
Current API (pci_set_mwi()) ties enabling MRM/MRL with enabling MWI
and I don't see a really good reason for that. Only the converse
is true - enabling MWI requires setting cachelinesize.
