Actually in this case all disk-access (and net-access) is illegal, and 
we're running in an empty chroot environment anyway. :)  We're not really 
running aps - they're more along the lines of CPU calculation pipes - data 
in -> calc in system memory -> data out.

I'm afraid this has to run without user-intervention and the policy is 
trivial - allow mem-management (brk/mmap...) + exit + read stdin + write 
stdout.
