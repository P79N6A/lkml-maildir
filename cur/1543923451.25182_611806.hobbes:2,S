I'll keep the probes and profile directory name ideas in mind, thanks.
This patchset does more than moving things around : its purpose is to
gather various kernel files that have similar purpose (instrumentation)
into a single directory so that it becomes easier to work on these
without duplicating the effort.
I see no good reason to have so many different adhoc instrumentation
mechanisms for profiling (sched, vm, oprofile) and tracing (blktrace,
suspend/resume tracing) all over the place. Merging them in a single
directory seems like a good step towards a more generic
instrumentation/profiling/tracing infrastructure.
Back to "profile" and "probes" directory names, they might be short, but
they do not represent the whole markup-profiling-tracing trio,
"profile" lacks the tracing part and "probe" lacks the markup part.
