Maybe newer version broke then. Until very recently, cdrecord worked
just fine as-is and used SG_IO access method when you used open by
device name. Which was just the way we wanted it.
If that doesn't work now, I suggest you take it up with Joerg. It's a
problem with his program.

Is there no cdrecord list? lkml surely isn't appropriate.
