So, I tried 2.6.2-rc1-bk1 and it locks up. How can I find out which 
patches it incorporated, so that I can filter out that bugger? (more see 
down, this time it was type 2)
I dunno about kgdb-ethernet (but I'll see whether I'll understand it) 
nor do I have a serial console.

I tried 2.6.3-rc1-mm1 without ACPI and it lock up up (type 1). I now can 
tell about two type of lock-up (maybe due to the same cause):
1) complete freeze, nothing possible, not able to read machine from 
network, must use reset button
2) freeze, but only mouse movement (nothing reacts though, keyboard 
neither) is possibel and log is flooded with error I posted, I can still 
reach machine via network and do a gracefull shutdown (killing X wasn't 
passible)
