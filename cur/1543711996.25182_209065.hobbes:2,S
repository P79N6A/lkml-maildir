preemption where? in irq? softirqd will preempt just fine.
Also not that while we process the callbacks in softirqd, the irqs will
stop running the callbacks, just like in your scenario. the callbacks
and the other softirqs will be processed from user context, and it won't
be different from scheduling krcud first and ksoftirqd later.

very nice.

I don't think this is enough (it is enough for the above workload
though, maybe for the dcache too, but it's not generic enough), 16
callbacks per tick too low frequency, it may not keep up, that's why I
suggested to offload the work to a re-arming tasklet that will finish it
ASAP (but in a scheduler-friendly way) instead of waiting the next tick.
But I certainly agree this is a nice solution in practice (at least with
all the common usages).
thanks!
