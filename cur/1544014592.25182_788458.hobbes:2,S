The problem with probe_kernel_address() is that it does lots of
operations around the access in the hot path (set_fs, pagefault_disable etc.), 
so i'm not sure that's a good idea. 
Sure you can probably do better, but that would involve
patching all architectures won't it? Ok I suppose
you could make an ARCH_HAS_blabla white list, but that
wouldn't be exactly pretty.
