  Here are the things I tried to see if I could make headway - none
  helped - still OOPS at boot:
     o Compiled with no highmem   - 
     o Compiled without SMP
     o removed  hdd=ide-scsi boot option
     o added ide0=nodma ide1=nodma boot option
     o switched to aic7xxx as a module using initrd
   Still crashes - any suggestions on what I should try next?
   Thanks,
   gene/
