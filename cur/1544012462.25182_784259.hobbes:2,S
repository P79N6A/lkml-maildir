Yes, I think that should be changed. Transient read errors are not
common, while bad blocks fixed by rewrite are quite common.

badblocks -n took > 8hours on 32GB flash, so no, that's not usable. I
started digging into badblocks (please take a look/apply following
documentation updates, I only understood some stuff when reading the
source)... And I wish I'd known about SIGALARM before.
Question: does badblocks expect the media to be valied ext2/3/4
