	What I was trying to point out is that this is not as simple a thing as it
first seems. Other possibilities include limiting the amount of a cache a
particular file can occupy, but then it becomes difficult to track this in
an LRU fashion.
	It's both hard to state what you want, and hard to find a way that's easy
to implement. It's also hard to come up with solutions that don't require
ugly things across kernel layers.
