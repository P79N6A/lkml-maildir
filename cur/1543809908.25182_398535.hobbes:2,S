No, it can not. See Doc*/power/video.txt . And there are more such problems.

How you play with ACPI/hw is major issue. Look at code to learn what you are talking
about. (and nobody uses APM today).

Virtualization is separate topic. It could be used for s-t-disk,
but it is quite heavy solution, and not likely to be usable for s-t-disk for
4+ years.

We have working solution *NOW*. It is called swsusp. If it does not work for you,
report it using bugzilla.kernel.org.
If you want something nicer/faster, help with suspend.sf.net.
