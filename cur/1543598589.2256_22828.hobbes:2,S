Justin,
I've tried removing your check, for writing bonnie++ still reports
slower write times then IDE drive on the other system.  Daniel Phillips
was great at helping me notice a problem that was causing slow down
but not related to the aic7xxx driver, thus I am now trying the
7.4.8-ac8 kernel.
I made your change whe will get try to get my user to test the system
with and without your change.
