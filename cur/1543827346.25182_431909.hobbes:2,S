I'm wondering what all this has to say about general principles of
sub-project development with the Linux kernel.
There is a strong tradition of software projects having a 'stable'
branch and a 'development' branch, and having both available and both
receiving bug fixes (at least) so that users can choose what best
suits their needs.
Due to the (quite appropriate) lack of a stable API for kernel
modules, it isn't really practical (and definitely isn't encouraged)
to distribute kernel-modules separately.  This seems to suggest that
if we want a 'stable' and a 'devel' branch of a project, both branches
need to be distributed as part of the same kernel tree.
Apart from ext2/3 - and maybe reiserfs - there doesn't seem to be much
evidence of this happening.  Why is that?
 - is -mm enough?  It seems to be enough for small updates, but
   doesn't seem to be enough for more major projects.  How long
   have the ext3 patches been in -mm?? (I cannot actually seem
   to find them there at all)
 - is there lots of -devel code slipping in to the 'stable' tree, thus
   resulting in a kernel.org tree that is permanently unstable (in
   which case there should be no objection to the new ext3 code -
   leave it to distros to keep it out until it is stable).
 - are we just not innovating as much as we could be and so don't
   need a -devel? Is ext3 the only site of major innovation?
   Seems unlikely.
It seems a bit rough to insist that the ext-fs fork every so-often,
but not impose similar requirements on other sections of code.
So: what would you (collectively) suggest should be the policy for
managing substantial innovation within Linux subsystems?  And how
broadly should it be applied?
