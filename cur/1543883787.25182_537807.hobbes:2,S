Sorry about the email address switch. This is actually work-related.
The stack vmalloc() and __pa() patches were partially intended to catch
or otherwise deliberately break such offenders and go BUG() on them. The
__pa() check in particular is exclusively for the purpose of catching
them. The primary motive being the stack vmalloc() patches remained, of
course, establishing a guard page to trap stack overflows.
