Ok. That I can certainly do, and I can post one patch per file in a logical 
order.

Generally, I agree, although my understanding of Rafael and Pavel's mindset is 
that swsusp is a dead dog and uswsusp is the way they want to see things go. 
swsusp is only staying for backwards compatability. If that's the case, 
perhaps we can just replace swsusp with Suspend2 and let them have their 
existing interface for uswsusp. Still not ideal, I agree, but it would be 
progress.

Ok. I didn't remember when reiser4 first appeared or how it got into -mm. I 
guess I'm picturing suspend2 as similar because I'm thinking of Suspend2 as 
pretty much a separate subsystem - it's interface to the rest of the kernel 
can be defined in terms of freeze|thaw_processes, drivers_suspend|resume, 
bmap|submit_bio and I'm imagining the Reiser4 would have a similar sort of 
limited set of functions it uses for interfacing with the rest of the kernel.

Nigel
