You know my opinion to EVMS - so I'd rather avoid makeing it mandatory.
But if the 2.5 actually looks then like I expect it now partitioning code
will be much simpler than - all code dealing with ondisk formats will
be in early, pre-mount-root userspace, based on Andries Brouwer's partx
(part of util-linux).

It was on Nov, 12 - but it was in a private thread that only started on
evms-devel.  So Mark was the only EVMS person that got it.  Sorry for
the confusion.
