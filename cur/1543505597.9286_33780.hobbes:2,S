Aug 12 02:33:56 asdf pppd[3569]: Using interface ppp0
Aug 12 02:33:56 asdf pppd[3569]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/modem
Aug 12 02:34:27 asdf pppd[3569]: LCP: timeout sending Config-Requests
Aug 12 02:34:27 asdf pppd[3569]: Connection terminated.
Aug 12 02:34:27 asdf pppd[3569]: Connect time 0.6 minutes.
Aug 12 02:34:27 asdf pppd[3569]: Receive serial link is not 8-bit clean:
Aug 12 02:34:27 asdf pppd[3569]: Problem: all had bit 7 set to 0
Aug 12 02:34:28 asdf pppd[3569]: Exit.
I just set up a PPP connection identical to another I have set up
except for the ISP.  So the ppp configuration is exactly the same
except for the ISP phone number, and the username and password.
The first ISP connects no problem, the second one I can't connect
to, I get the above error.  What do I have to do to get rid of
this 8 bit clean error?
I am suspecting that the ISP in question has their modems
configured to use 7bit (7N1?) instead of 8N1.
What should I do about this?  It is CRITICALLY important that I
get this connection working ASAP.
Sorry for not using the most appropriate mailing list, but this
is an EXTREMELY timing critical deadline thing, and the PPP
connection does NOT work in Linux, but it does in win95 with no
special changes...
Please advise!
TIA
