   Please, no, let's not change again. Let's get things fixed. Put out a
   CFV. I really would like to have 2.4 working properly on my laptop,
   with it's mix of CardBus and older PCMCIA cards.
If we're going to take time out to move BKL's locks around (which I
really think we shouldn't do), let's at least also take time to make
sure PCMCIA functionality is at least as good in 2.4 as 2.2.  
Otherwise, lots of folks will have to stay at 2.2, and folks who
maintain device drivers will have to keep the ugly #ifdef
LINUX_VERSION_CODE for far longer than they might otherwise have to use
it, since people will stick to 2.2 and people maintaining device drivers
will have to support multiple kernel versions for possibly a *very* long
time.
