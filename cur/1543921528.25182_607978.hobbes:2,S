Other arch code e.g. ia64 changes it for add/remove also.  But I fail
to see how it matters.

That would be needless complexity.

cpu_present_map isn't a "local data structure" any more than
cpu_online_map, and it is quite relevant to cpu hotplug.  We have to
maintain the invariant that the set of cpus online is a subset of cpus
present.

I don't feel like I'm getting through here.  Let me restate.
If I'm reading them correctly, these patches are changing the behavior
of lock_cpu_hotplug() from mutex-style locking to a kind of read-write
locking.  I think that's fine, but the naming of the new API poorly
reflects its real behavior.  Conversion of lock_cpu_hotplug() users
should be done with care.  Most of them - those that need one of the
cpu maps to remain unchanged during a critical section - can be
considered readers.  But a few (such as pseries_add_processor() and
pseries_remove_processor()) are writers, because they modify one of
the maps.
So, why not:
get_cpus_online   -> cpumaps_read_lock
put_cpus_online   -> cpumaps_read_unlock
cpu_hotplug_begin -> cpumaps_write_lock
cpu_hotplug_end   -> cpumaps_write_unlock
Or something similar?
