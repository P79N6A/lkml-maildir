Hello,
actually the question is in subj.
Problem is that there is a program which needs to know physical memory
size. This information is used to justify memory consumption as after some
swapping performance is drops dramatically, and it is better to finish.
I know that this is not the best idea, but it is assumed that this program
is the only one running on the machine.
I do not want to use proc as some people can just do not mount it.
Any comments, suggestions?
Thanks in advance.
Denis Perchine.
