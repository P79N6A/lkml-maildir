I think these should have been split logically into 4 groups of
patches (except perhaps where they touched the same file for the first
two and the last).
The third type should go through trivial.
And they should have been split logically by subsystem, most likely?

I'm not a maintainer of any code by any means, but it seems odd,
redundant and visually confusing to me to use the dev_dbg() function
and have KERN_DEBUG's inside the string -- makes me question every
time why there isn't one for the first line too.
Perhaps these multi-line debug statements should simply be split into
multiple dev_dbg() calls? Similar for the other dev_ functions. I
think it might look cleaner, at least. Just my two cents, not a NAK or
anything.
Thanks,
Nish
