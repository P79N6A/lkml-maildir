Thanks, Dmitry.  Now I do recall seeing that before.
That patchset appears to go part, but not all the way to fitting in with
the existing namespaces.  For instance, you use exit_task_namespaces() for
refcounting, but don't put the net_namespace in the nsproxy and use your
own mechanism for unsharing.
It really seems useful to have all the namespaces be consistent whenever
practical, and I don't think your patchset would need much tweaking to
fit onto Cedric's patch.  Am I missing a complicating factor?
thanks,
