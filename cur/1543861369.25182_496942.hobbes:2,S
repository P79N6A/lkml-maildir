This one?
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=ab17443a3df35abe4b7529e83511a591aa7384f3
Doesn't it break existing setups without giving ANY warning?
theoretical (I don't have hardware in question) scenario:
- user uses atiixp and has modular libata/ahci (or no libata/ahci et all)
- user does kernel upgrade
- boot fails
- ...
If this is true please add something like
printk(KERN_WARNING "PCI: setting SB600 SATA to AHCI mode"
" (please use ahci driver instead of atiixp)\n");
to quirk_sb600_sata() so people will at least know what is wrong...
> cleaned. Now we remove these code sine they are no use any longer.

[ but the patch is line wrapped and unfortunately doesn't apply ]
PS: please always cc: linux-ide@vger.kernel.org on PATA/SATA patches
Thanks,
Bart
