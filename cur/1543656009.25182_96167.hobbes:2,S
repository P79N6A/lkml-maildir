Yup, no probs.
It would be good to measure how often that codepath actually gets invoked
during testing and use.  It's typically quite rare.  It should be just
MAP_SHARED stuff, although there are probably some highmem-related scenarii
in which it will happen.
I'll add a writeback_control.for_reclaim boolean so we don't have to play
games with PF_MEMALLOC to reverse engineer the calling context.
If XFS is going to writearound extra pages in ->writepage() then it would
be best to set PG_reclaim (if wbc->for_reclaim) so end_page_writeback()
will rotate them.
