Not to ask a stupid question, but what type of "real-world usage" would you
like to see?  I did most of the Alpha work (yes John I still owe you an
update - in your inbox by end of the day) so I have scads of example outputs
under various loads, but almost all of them are benchmark-driven.  If there
is anything of that ilk that would be remotely interesting to you, let me
know and I'll send you what I have (or generate a new one).
