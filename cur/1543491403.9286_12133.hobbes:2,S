Hi David,
Let's just say I'm learning about the linux kernel with a device I
understand.
OK, so user process address space lies below 0xC0000000 and there is a
different mapping per process. Kernel mappings are above 0xC0000000 and are
constant. So when a syscall is run, we're still in the user process context,
therefore the userspace mappings still exist for that process. (How am I
doing?) This means that the copy-from-user() and copy-to-user() can just be
simple copies.
But I'm still confused by the virt-to-phys macro. I would have thought if I
want to find the physical address of a user space buffer I would have to go
through the page table to fins out where is physical page is, not just mask
off some bits.
Cheers
Paul
