What do you need this for?
Mostly it looks like you just need to use kmap, but...
As other have pointed out ramfs is usually the better solution,
and you don't need to code anything.
Or are you trying to use an 7GB initrd.  An interesting idea
but that would take a little bootloader hacking to make work.
