This is not correct. VESA did not define 1600x1200 as part of
its DVT standard. And starting with VBE 2.0, VESA is not going to
define new mode ID's. Thus the mode ID that you get for 1600x1200 may
be unique only for your particular hardware/Video BIOS.
You may use X's 'vesa' driver to get a list of modes that your
BIOS supports. It will be written to /var/log/X*.0.log.
