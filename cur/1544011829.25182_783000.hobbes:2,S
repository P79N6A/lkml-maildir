Could be input, could be HID, could even be USB.
You're sure that 2.6.28-rc8 was OK?
2.6.28-rc9 had only a small number of changes.  Nothing I can see in
input or HID.  A few USB changes, but pretty specific ones -
unusual_devs entries and such.
Maybe your mouse has died?  Did you retest with an older kernel?
