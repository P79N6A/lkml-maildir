Dang! I stared at the code a long time to see what you were doing...
And concluded that you had coded what you intended; allow processes that
share UIDs to kill one another - independent of capabilities. The fact
that this is the reverse of the words you used to introduce your patch,
I didn't notice.
I totally missed the fact that this was (unwanted) new functionality!!
Mea culpa for the bad review.
I certainly Sign off the revised patch.
Cheers
Andrew
