The thing is, even with UDMA disabled in the kernel, I still see the corruption
with 2.4.x (release) and above.  Anything written while using the kernel is
corrupted.   Much of the stuff will read fine (files) ... but I believe
directories get the IO error immediately and some files do also.  Everything is
seen as corrupted when you fsck a partition where this kernel has been run and
created files on.   This is a silent corruption without any errors reported and
I've only tested it on ext2.  You cannot create FS's with these kernels (at
least on the VIA chipsets) since they too are corrupted (note, only tested ext2
fs).   I did disable UDMA everywhere and still saw it happen, this problem is
not present in older 2.4.0-test kernels so it's something in the late
pre-release stage and into the release stage.
