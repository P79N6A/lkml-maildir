Hi Salah,

Beware that eeprom files are binary files, so "diff" might not be the
more suitable tool for the job. "cmp" would probably do better.
Nevertheless, I think I remember that diff can at least differenciate
between identical and different binary files, so your test must still be
valid.
> So it seems to work with VT8235.
Yes, it does. Antonino A. Daplas reported success on his VT8235 in
private as well, so I am now confident that this chip is OK. The
question remains for VT82C686A and B though.
Thanks for your help!
