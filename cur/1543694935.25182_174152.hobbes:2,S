If the result is used for crypto that is a requirement, as noted in the
original post. See below. And if it's in a shared library it's subject
to various other attempts at control or duplication of results.

If you are running multiple threads you may really want some independent
random numbers. Looking at this, I believe that if I open the device and
then various threads read blocks from the device, each will get
independent random numbers.
Take this as "there are benefits to having this in the kernel" and not
"this really should be in the kernel." A contribution to the discussion.
What I don't hear is results from testing, from doing this as a
procedure, etc.
