Kai's patch is almost identical to what I've been applying to every 2.3/2.4
kernel for the last year, ever since RedHat included a newer binutils
which printed these "indirect lcall without `*'" warnings.
My patch kit also fixes an occurrence in bootsect.S -- see below.
This really ought to go into 2.5 ASAP, IMHO.
