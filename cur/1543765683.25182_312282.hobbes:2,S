Currently there is a (configurable) global limit for all non-root FUSE
mounts.  An additional per-user limit would be nice, but from the
security standpoint it doesn't matter.

I haven't yet seen the need for such a great flexibility.  Debian
installs fusermount (the FUSE mount utility) "-rwsr-x--- root fuse",
so only users in the "fuse" group are allowed to use it.  This is sane
for a new technology, but I expect these limitations to be removed
once it establishes itsef as a secure solution.

Maybe it is necessary, but why bother until somebody actually wants
it?  I'm a great believer of the "lazy" development philosophy ;)
Thanks,
