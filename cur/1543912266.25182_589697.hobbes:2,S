Hello,
I am not the one to handle the issue. I have just supplied the
pinconfigs for the intel mac cards and assisted with logs/debug
information, so I happen to be more of an end user. I am not familiar
with the code base of the Intel HDA Codec. Takashi Iwai is the one
with the knowledge to fix the problem.
Regards.
