Loopback device wasn't configured correctly in kernel config file (I
thought it was, but I fiddled and now it works). So thanks, it now works
fine. I have a 1.5Gb  rc6 encrypted partition with my sensitive data on
and a nice script to set it up/take it down. If the kernel core dumps,
will  the password be in that? just athought. Thanx.
