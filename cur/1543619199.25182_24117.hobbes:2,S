I'm confused.
Wouldn't Bugzilla be perfect for this?  I run a slightly modified
version
for the company I work for.  You could have as many administrators as
you
need, and use categories for different kernel subsystems.  The
maintainers
could be set-up as QA contacts, and it's really easy to maintain.
How about 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 (assuming the servers get fixed
someday)
Just a thought.

Indeed.  The issue of kernel bug tracking gets pondered and discussed
every few months it seems (not without need, mind you).
To tie this back into the original whine from RobL, what we do NOT need
is a patch secretary.  What we do need, desperately, is
(a) a bug-tracking system, and
(b) at least one sharp person, with bunches of help from kernel
developers and users alike, to close fixed bugs, ping users, clear out
garbage so that the bug database has a very high signal-to-noise ratio.
Good kernel bug tracking can be done, but it requires human maintenance,
by someone or someones with a brain.  It cannot be done without plenty
of automation, though, as tytso (god bless him for trying!) showed...
Such would be a significant boon to -all- Linux users.
