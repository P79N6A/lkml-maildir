	I hope you are kidding, right? Do you realize *what* size this
thing will have? Not to mention the fact that normal semantics wrt removal
when the last reference goes away will be killed on spot. The main problem
with opening by inode is in interaction with dcache. You'll introduce a
slew of races and I pity one trying to fix *that* mess. Please, don't.
