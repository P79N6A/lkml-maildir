An oops is usually a condition you can recover from in some/most/depends 
cases (e.g. a null deref in a filesystem "only" makes that vfsmount 
(filesystem at all?) blocked), so if the kernel is waiting for user input 
on a non-panic condition, this means userspace stops too, which is not 
too good if the kernel is still 'alive'.
It's like we are entering kdb although everything is fine enough to go 
through a proper `init 6`.

I doubt this scrollback buffer is implemented as part of the video cards. 
It is rather a kernel invention, and therefore uses standard RAM. But the 
idea is good, preferably make it a CONFIG_ option.

I am not sure, but would enabling interrupts be enough?

And analog photos? ;)

Whilst few can be done in X situations, let's at least improve consoles.
