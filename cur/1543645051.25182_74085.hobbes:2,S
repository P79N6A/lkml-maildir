But it's not just the drive's elevator that we depend on.  You have to 
transfer the data to the drive as well.  The worst case is SCSI-2 where all 
phases of the transfer except data are narrow and asynchronous.  We get 
abysmal performance in SCSI-2 if the OS gives us 16 contiguous 4k data chunks 
instead of one 64k one because of the high command setup overhead.
Even the protocols which can transfer the header at the same speed, like FC, 
benefit from having large data to header ratios in their frames.
Therefore, it is in SCSI's interest to have the OS merge requests if it can 
purely from the transport efficiency point of view.  Once we accept the 
necessity of having the OS do some elevator work it becomes detrimental to 
have this work repeated in the drive firmware.
I guess, however, that this issue will evaporate substantially once the 
aic7xxx driver uses ordered tags to represent the transaction integrity since 
the barriers will force the drive seek algorithm to follow the tag 
transmission order much more closely.
