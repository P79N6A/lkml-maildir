From Jargon File (4.3.0, 30 APR 2001) [jargon]:
  WOMBAT /wom'bat/ adj. [acronym: Waste Of Money, Brains, And Time]
     Applied to problems which are both profoundly {uninteresting} in
     themselves and unlikely to benefit anyone interesting even if solved.

A reference to the "VM replacement research was finished in 60s", I
presume.
