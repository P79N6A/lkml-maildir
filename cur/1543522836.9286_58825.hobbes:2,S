first of all , 
agp and pci slot 1 share the interrupt on assus boards , i havent been able
to get rid of this ... ever ...
as far as the linux server it has no irq conflicts, here : 
fw:~# cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       
  0:   14041890          XT-PIC  timer
  1:        758          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  3:          8          XT-PIC  serial
  5:   39524704          XT-PIC  Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 Ethernet
  9:    6794181          XT-PIC  Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 Ethernet
 10:   39691766          XT-PIC  Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 Ethernet
 11:     204801          XT-PIC  aic7xxx
 13:          1          XT-PIC  fpu
 14:          4          XT-PIC  ide0
i may have not quite understood your question 
PS: slot arrangement 
agp : video 
pci 1: n/a 
pci2: 2940uw 
pci3,4,5: eepro
and as far as the driver is concerned everything works fine up to 2.2.13
i havent tried 2214 but someone else did( look down through the discussion ,
i tried 2.3.39 ...
