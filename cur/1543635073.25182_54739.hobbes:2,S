Yes, exactly.

Thinking about it some more, I'm wondering if we treat them only as 
belonging to the top-level networking class and have the layer-2 protocols 
be interfaces to those devices. For most devices, there would be only one 
interface, but it would also cover the case in which a device supports 
multiple prototcols. 
This is similar to the input layer. Initially, I had grouped specific 
devices into subclasses. But, I learned that a device really belongs to 
multiple subclasses (e.g. evdev and mouse). Hence the concept of one class 
with multiple interfaces...
