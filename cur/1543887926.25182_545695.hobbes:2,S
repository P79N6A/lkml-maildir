ark3116 supports set_termios (0x5402), but does not get_termios 
(0x5401). Not sure how that affects userspace, though.
The 0xFFFFFFB0 looks like a simple formatting error (ark3116.c line 66)
an explicit cast to (unsigned char)buf[0] or (unsigned int) seems 
required.

The -62 only shows up when the cable is already connected when I 
modprobe ark3116. Reinserting it - and no "-62" shows up.
Maybe this is something normal with USB?

(I found that I already need to modprobe usbserial with debug=1,
since ark3116 uses usb_serial_generic_write)

I would have to test with a real serial port. (I do not
have any real port right now, just two cables + adapters.)
What certainly does not work: Connecting two cables to each other, that is,
USB-RS232-GenderChanger-RS232-USB. (1) USB ends connected to the same machine
(2) USB ends connected to different machines. Both (1) and (2) do not work.
The write() seems to succeed, but read() blocks:
# klogconsole -l8 -r0
# ./sertest
[...]
