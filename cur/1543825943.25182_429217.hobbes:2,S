I would say by default the kernel should not allow any out-of-spec power 
condition. Some devices might decide to go into over-current mode if a 
device draws too much power, taking down other devices on the USB bus. 
This sort of behavior should only be enabled if the user explicitly 
chooses to live dangerously.
Especially given the fact that Windows enforces the USB power supply 
limits strictly, and that's where all the hardware is best tested..
