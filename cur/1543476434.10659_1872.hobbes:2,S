I tried gated-people but didn't have any luck.
I'm having problems using GateD 3-5-10 rdisc (ICMP Router Discovery
Protocol - RFC1256) in broadcast mode on Linux 2.0.36. It works fine in
multicast mode, but when I try to use broadcast I get the following error
in syslog:
Jan  5 18:37:37 task_send_packet: task ICMP socket 7 length 16 flags
MSG_DONTROUTE(4) to 192.168.0.255: Permission denied
Any ideas?
