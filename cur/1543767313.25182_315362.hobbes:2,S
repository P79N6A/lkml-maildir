Ok, now tell this to one of the users who tests kernels, now users also 
need to know how to use git in order to test -mm. I'm thinking about the 
case where someone reports a bug on LKML and we ask that they test latest 
-mm, getting them to also understand git just to quickly test something is 
silly. Also people tend to have other things to do so making things 
even slightly more difficult doesn't win you testers. Maybe i'm just 
lazy... *shrug*
