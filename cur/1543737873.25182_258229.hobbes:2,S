That's a prime example, yes...

Why does -rc2 have to be a magic number?  Does that really make sense to 
users that we want to be testing our stuff?

I thought I just did ;-)

Sure I'm sitting on over 100 net driver csets myself.  I'm glad, but the 
overall point is still that "-rc" -- which stands for Release Candidate 
-- is nowhere near release candidate status when -rc1 hits, and fluff 
like sparse notations and changes like the fasync API change in 2.6.8 
always seem to sneak in at the last minute, further belieing(sp?) the 
supposed Release Candidate status.
No matter the effort of maintainers to hold back patches, every 
violation of the Release Candidate Bugfixes Only policy serves to 
undermine user confidence and invalidate previous Q/A work.
