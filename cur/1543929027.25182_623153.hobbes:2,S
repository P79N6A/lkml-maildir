Well, I really would like to learn some things here, could we
keep this off-topic thread alive just a bit, please ?
(I know, I'm going to gain a troll's fame because I can't avoid this
discussions, its one of my secret vices...)

I think BeOS was C++ and OSX is C+ObjectiveC (and runs on an iPhone).
Original MacOS (fron 6 to 9) was Pascal (and a mac SE was very near
to embedded hardware :) ).
I do not advocate to rewrite Linux in C++, but don't say a kernel written
in C++ can not be efficient.

C++ (and for what I read on other answer, nor ObjectiveC) has no garbage
collection. It does not anything you did not it to do. It just allows
you to change this
	struct buffer *x;
	x = kmalloc(...)
	x->sz = 128
	x->buff = kmalloc(...)
	...
	kfree(x->buff)
	kfree(x)
to
	struct buffer *x;
	x = new buffer(128); (that does itself allocates x->buff,
                              because _you_ programmed it,
                              so you poor programmer don't forget)
        ...
	delete x;            (that also was programmed to deallocate
                              x->buff itself, sou you have one less
                              memory leak to worry about)

An vtable in C++ takes exactly the same space that the function
table pointer present in every driver nowadays... and probably
the virtual method call that C++ does itself with
	thing->do_something(with,this)
like
	push thing
	push with
	push this
	call THING_vtable+indexof(do_something) // constants at compile time
is much more efficient that what gcc can mangle to do with
	thing->do_something(with,this,thing)
	push with
	push this
	push thing
	get thing+offsetof(do_something) // not constant at compile time
	dereference it
	call it
(that is, get a generic field on a structure and use it as jump address)
In short, the kernel is object oriented, implements OO programming by
hand, but the compiler lacks the knowledge that it is object oriented
programming so it could do some optimizations.

People usually complains about RTTI or exceptions, but benefits versus
memory space should be seriously considered (sure there is something
in current drivers to ask 'are you a SATA or an IDE disk?').
