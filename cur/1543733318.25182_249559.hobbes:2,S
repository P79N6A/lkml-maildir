Wow, these tow articles are eye-openers :-)
I couldn't even remotley think of debugging my CPU :-D

Hmm, uniting a few hundred Crusoe users can easily be done, but...

I don't have X on this laptop, but I'll put tonight.
Actually, I was given this laptop after a few major falls (and a hard kick!),
so it is barely mobile, strapped/fixed to a metal board and used mainly via ssh.
I had some nasty bug appearing every couple of days without any trace left with linux-2.6.3
(machine stays on, but no reaction to KBD, network, USB, etc; nothing in the logs, on hte screen, no beeps).
But now with 2.6.8.1 I have 15d uptime :-)
If you get closer to a smaller (than X running) testcase, post it here, so other people (and me) can try easily.
I'd be happy to swich a few (fast) CPUs from SETI@Home to Transmeta@Home if not illegal :-)
Kalin.
