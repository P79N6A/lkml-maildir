Yes, but it sucks. Look at how _hard_ it has been to add standard sized 
types even just to user-mode C.
It so happens that "int" has been fairly stable at 32 bits for a long
time, and largely continues to be so. That's make it less painful than
most other things. "long" has certainly long since stopped being a good
type for doing any portable stuff. 
So while "char" and "int" have happened to not be painful, it's still
wrong to depend on types that aren't explicitly sized, because it _will_
break eventually.
