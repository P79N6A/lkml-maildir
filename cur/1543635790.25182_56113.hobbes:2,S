[1] Should stay like this. Or at least only the original message
should go to the log file.
Just an example:
Huch? Sytemkernseite konnte nicht an Adresse 1098bf00 eingeblendet werden.
current->tss.cr3 = 0062d000, %cr3 = 0062d000
*pde = 00000000

This is only German, which is very similiar to whose character
set is a slight superset of the characterset in UK/US.
Now consider the same message in Chinese (20.000 possible
characters), Hebrew (right to left and 'strange' characters), 
Arabic (right to left, strange rules for composing connections
between the characters, which even Micro$oft was unable to get
right) and many more fun.
So the driver writer has get his debugging messages translated
somehow and than he has to ask the translation serices again to
translate the bug report from the user.
Sorry, this sounds like someone is looking for a market niche
for getting more money instead of getting real problems solved.
Communication requires a common language. This is English for
Problems regarding Linux kernel development and maintenance.
Anything else would slow down both, because of added complexity.

Ingo Oeser, who thinks i18ned user space messages are enough
pain in the ass.
