What if people are booting via /bin/sh and then setting up
their custom chroot's and init(s), and don't want these init(s) to
be part of a session?
It is also particularly possible for an embedded system to start
up via /bin/sh running /etc/profile rather than using an init type
program.
Also, the above doesn't help people specifying "init=/bin/sh" on the
command line (as per the original post subject).  The real solution
is for them to specify a different init= or run/exec something to set
up their tty and session once logged in.
