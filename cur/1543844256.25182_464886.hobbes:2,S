You mean using the jump-over thing that was posted earlier?
I thought the CPU erratas prevented doing that atomically
properly. From my understanding of the last 24 hours discussion,
it seemed like the ONLY thing we could do safely atomically was
insert an int3. Which sucks, frankly, but still.
Or are we talking about locking everyone in an NMI? Having
proposed that, I now think it doesn't work ... we still return
from it when it's done, and might be in the middle of the
instruction stream we just crapped on.
So, maybe I missed a bit of the conversation, or didn't understand
it, but I was trying to follow it pretty closely. Even with the
padding, I don't see how overwriting it is atomic ... they could
be off processing an interrupt / NMI or whatever when you were
in the midst of it.
One thing Michael (cc'ed) pointed out was the possibility of using
"jump to self" as a small marker instruction, where we set the
function in busy wait at the start as we overwrite the next few,
then overwrite the jump to selfs with a nop to liberate it again.
But I'm unconvinced that gets around the CPU errata Alan was
pointing to.
