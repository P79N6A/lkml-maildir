Yes, I saw that. I tried to give an explanation with more details.

According to these numbers one can think that you don't need RDMA at
all, just send iSCSI PDUs over IB. The benchmarks that you use are
synthetic IB benchmarks that are not equivalent to iSCSI over iSER. They
just send IB packets. I'm not surprised that you got more or less the
same performance because, AFAIK, ib_send_bw doesn't copy data (unlike
iSCSI that has to copy data that is sent/received without RDMA).
When you use RDMA with iSCSI (i.e. iSER), you don't need to create iSCSI
PDUs and process them. The CPU is not busy as it is with iSCSI over TCP
because no data copies are required. Another advantage is that you don't
need header/data digest because the IB HW does that.
