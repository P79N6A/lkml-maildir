Subject: timer glitch (solved?)

My clock, some times, gives wrong results. When I call the folowing
command
  bash$ while : ; do date ; done
the time shown is not correct. When the seconds are changing, for a
small period of time, the time is offset by about 1h12min. E.g. when the
clock is changing from 1h30min30sec to 1h30min31sec, some 2 or 3 lines
shown are 2h42min.
I don't know how to reproduce the problem. It seems the timer enters
this wrong state after using mplayer (maybe because it's
"timer-hungry").
I've read the "timer glitch on 2.4.18: solved" thread in this list and I
think it's the same problem.
Still not clear to me: should I experience this problem w/ 2.4.19? Is there a way so I can have the clock working properly?
BTW, I don't know if it's important to mention: I'm using rtc. But even
when I remove the rtc module, the problem persists.
Some data on my system (maybe useful):
