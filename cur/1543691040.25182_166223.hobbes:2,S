The NFS server was unable to read the directories it was exporting, so it 
would allow the mount command but then fail to do anything.
I expect the NFS client to behave sensibly in the face of all possible server 
errors, including the possibility of a hostile NFS server.

It was also patched.  I will try and reproduce the error with an unpatched 
kernel and a tcpdump running.
