I personally think string parsers are *much* better than the alternatives

That's *MUCH* worse.
Strings are nice. They aren't that complex, and as long as it's not a 
performance-critical area, there are basically no downsides.
Binary structures and ioctl's are *much* worse. They are totally 
undebuggable with generic tools (think "echo" or "strace"), and they are a 
total nightmare to parse across architectures and pointer sizes.
So the rule should be: always use strings if at all possible and relevant. 
If the data is fundamentally binary, it shouldn't be re-coded to ascii (no 
real advantage), but if the data is "stringish", and there aren't big 
performance issues, then keep it as strings.
