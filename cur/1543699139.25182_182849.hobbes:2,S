So to attenuate people's worries it should be stated in some form:
A:	Such a functionality isn't needed on a properly configured
	system. All devices present on the system should generate
	hotplug events, loading the appropriate driver, and udev
	should notice and create the appropriate device node.
	In case of failure, please make a proper bug report.
Of course, you'll have to translate it to correct english.
