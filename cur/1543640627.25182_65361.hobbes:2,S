actually i am running lilo..
the one that comes with debian 3.0.
the problem also occurs with every bootable linux cd, that i tried.. as long 
as it's running kernel 2.4.19.
debian bf24 kernel image (i think its 2.4.16?) is booting when i append 
mem=511M, knoppix/gentoo with 2.4.19 doesnt.
would you suggest that i try grub ?
