Heh. They've always been there, then. I really did re-add the table from 
an older arch/i386/kernel/setup.c ;)

Ok, I added it.

The Celeron detection happens in init_intel().

Handled in init_intel().

Added to init_intel().

Um, leave as default?

Added. Wait, isn't Foster the one with HT? The ones I have say that they
