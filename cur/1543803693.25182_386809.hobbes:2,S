Is your USB controller an OHCI? If so, try reverting this patch:
<URL:http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=110313153001002&w=2>
Apparently some mfrs' OHCI controllers need this patch to function sanely,
but mine (in a Libretto L5) won't suspend after this change, and works
great without it.
