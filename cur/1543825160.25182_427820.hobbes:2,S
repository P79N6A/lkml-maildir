Hi Pete,
Please look here:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2817#c4
"I will not accept this patch (or any similar patch) to extend the atkbd.c
mapping table - only standard scancodes are allowed there. The table is
easily modified from userspace, and that is the way to go.
In the past I tried to fill the table with all the entries, but found out
that there are two or three keyboards competing for every position in the
scancode table, with a different keycode."
I continue to agree with Vojtech's position here. Because kernel does not
have ability to detect the kind of keyboard connected to a box (nor do we
really want to store all this data in the kernel) all fine tuning of AT
keymap should be done from userspace.
