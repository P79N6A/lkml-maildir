I think you need user-private groups and setgid directories.
First of all, ensure that each user has a group of
their own. Do NOT put all users into a "users" group.
So user "gami" would be in group "gami", or maybe
a "gami_group" group if you prefer. Have the home
directories owned by these groups.
Second, set the umask to allow group write access.
(this is why you need the user-private groups)
Now suppose you have two users, bill and tom,
who need to work together on the spamming project.
Create a group called "spamming". Create a project
directory /projects/spamming owned by root and
in the spamming group. Make this directory setgid
and group writable. Any files created in this
directory will be owned by the spamming group.
Due to the umask setting, permissions on these
new files will allow access by all group members.
The setgid bit will propagate to any newly created
directories, but not to newly created files.
