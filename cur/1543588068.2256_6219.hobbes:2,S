Not purely a compiler convention, but an ABI requirement.  In particular, Linux
GCC adheres to the ABI specified in the System V UNIX Intel386 (tm) Processor
Supplement, and on page 6-66, in figure 6-70, the specification for stddef.h
says that:
	typedef int ptrdiff_t;
	typedef unsigned int size_t;
	typedef long wchar_t;

While, I grant that this is one area the ABI could have been improved upon
(alignment of floating point, and reservation of EBX as GOT pointers are other
sore spots), it is the ABI of record.  Yes, we could certainly choose a
different ABI for Linux, but it is probably too late for that in the case of
the x86.
