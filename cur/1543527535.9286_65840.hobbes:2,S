Editors are careful to place the modified file into the same inode as the
original. Only exception I found when I did a extensive check a while back
was jed, and that is broken IMHO. Gave me quite a headache on Solaris,
where the /etc/rc?d/* files are _hard_ links into /etc/init: Using vi(1) or
emacs(1) allowed correct fixing of the files, jed(1) doesn't... the hard
links elsewhere point to the backup afterwards!
Better use symlinks, lndir(1x) is for this.
