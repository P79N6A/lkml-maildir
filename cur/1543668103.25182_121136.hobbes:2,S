I was only 3MB off wrt. mainline's 64GB LowTotal, not bad at all:
HighTotal:    65134592 kB
HighFree:     65116864 kB
LowTotal:       176076 kB
LowFree:        144180 kB
Turns out NR_CPUS > BITS_PER_LONG was avoided. I'll dig up whatever else
I can here. AIM7 with 10000 tasks and various other things were runnable
on 48GB, but I still need to straighten various fragmentation things out
before benching produces meaningful numbers instead of runs vs. doesn't.
