I can't wait to finally get a usable rivafb. Previous versions 
have been both buggy and catastophically slow. This version 
(0.9.0) was fast enough to make things work as smoothly as 
without a framebuffer device. 
B.T.W. is there any way of getting the text-only mode 
working and still having fb available for, say, having 
fbtv (tv tuner for fb devices) running at one console 
while the other consoles would still be using text mode?
Robert.
