  I know about it (I think I already mentioned this problem...). We have to consider following:
  * Yes, we hit 2GB limit but this limit is only on 32-bit arch and in 2.3 we hopefuly
    remove it completely. Anyway we still have ~25 bits to use :-).
  * We don't have good estimation of how large should hash table be and resizing it is really pain.
  * Lookup will slow down as we will have to go through hash chain which is written on the disk. We
    cache dquots in memory but...
  * Need some space for hash table (but this is of no interest).
  I thought about some trees but without reasonable result...
  My final conclusion is that some more complex structure is probably not a win. Maybe when I'll make
thinks work with simple table I'll try to implement some more sophisticated structure. We have development
phase so we can afford experiments ;-)
