I wouldnt say this to an individual, but since you are a vendor perhaps you
ought to go get a scanner and do some testing  then provide an accurate
error report with the precise error messages.
I know people using scanners with aha29xx on 2.2.12pre so I suspect its
a paticular scanner/driver combination
