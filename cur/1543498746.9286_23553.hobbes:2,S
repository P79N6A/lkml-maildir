Explain this. Any decent hash function has the following properties:
- non invertible (or not trivially so)
- collision-"proof", that is it is computationally difficult to find
two inputs which result in the same output.
(note that a good hash function need not be bijective, and I'd
conjecture that it shouldn't be)
I don't see the sensitivity here.
