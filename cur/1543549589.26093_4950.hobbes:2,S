I can't remember anything about protected mode interrupt handlers nor have 
I ever looked at Linux interrupt handling but at least in real mode from my 
good old PC/DOS programming days I seem to remember that if you are hooking 
a hardware interrupt vector then you have to issue a end of interrupt (EOI) 
to the 8259A interrupt controller (PIC) before doing the iret, for example 
like so:
; Note: this uses "dst, src" operand ordering not the
; "reversed" ordering used by gcc asm.
         push ax
         mov al,20h      ; Nonspecific EOI
         out 20h,al      ; Write PIC output control word OCW2
         pop ax
         iret
Might this be the problem (or whatever the equivalent specific is in Linux 
/ pmode)?
Just my 2p.

         Anton
