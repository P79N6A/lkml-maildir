Of course not :)
ahc_reset
	aic7770_config -> can sleep
	ahc_pci_config -> can sleep
	ahc_shutdown -> can't sleep, whoops
	ahc_resume -> dead code
ahc_init
	aic7770_config -> can sleep
	ahc_pci_config -> can sleep
ahc_acquire_seeprom
	check_extport -> can sleep
	ahc_proc_write_seeprom -> can sleep
so, ahc_init and ahc_acquire_seeprom can s/ahc_delay/ahc_sleep/ safely.
Oh, and I found another bug:  never use check_region, it's inherently 
racy.  Use request_region and check its return value.	
Note I agree with a comment in the code, that wrapping SHT->detect() in 
io_request_lock is silly...  the comment describing the rationale in 
drivers/scsi/scsi.c is not really accurate...
