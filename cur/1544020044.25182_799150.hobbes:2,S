I tried this patch atop 29-rc3 + your patch from yesterday with my
simple test program at 
http://free.linux/hp.com/~lts/Tests/mmap_lock.c.
 
The test program shows the /proc/<pid>/maps before and after the mmap
and attempted merge.  It's not merging:
7fd20a668000-7fd20a66a000 rw-p 7fd20a668000 00:00 0 
7fd20a68a000-7fd20a68b000 r--s 00000000 68:23 6608852                    /tmp/tmpfVx1SFL (deleted)
7fd20a68b000-7fd20a68c000 r--s 00001000 68:23 6608852                    /tmp/tmpfVx1SFL (deleted)
7fd20a68c000-7fd20a690000 rw-p 7fd20a68c000 00:00 0 
Ad hoc instrumentation shows that it's the VM_ACCOUNT flag that is
different between the existing file segment and the one attempting the
merge:
is_mergeable_vma: !mergable: vma flags:  0x80020f9:0x1020f9
                                           |         |-VM_ACCOUNT
                                           +-----------VM_CAN_NONLINEAR
So happens, I'm mapping with MAP_SHARED, so the VM_ACCOUNT flag gets
cleared later in mmap_region().  Comments say that this is for checking
memory availability during shmem_file_setup().  Maybe we can move the
temporary setting of VM_ACCOUNT until just before the call to
shmem_zero_setup()?
