I don't mean to imply that hw_random should be modified to support all 
hardware RNGs.  Separate drivers are perfectly OK with me.  I would even 
take patches that split up hw_random into an RNG registration interface, 
and AMD/Intel/VIA support modules.
The part I disagree with is direct kernel->kernel RNG usage, with no 
intervening checks.
This has all been discussed years ago, when the FIPS testing was in the 
kernel (and then removed, per consensus).
