Quote from loop-AES' README file:
"
7.1. Example 1 - Encrypting swap on 2.4 and newer kernels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Device backed (partition backed) loop is capable of encrypting swap on 2.4
and newer kernels. File backed loops can't be used for swap.
"
That "file backed loops can't be used for swap" warning has been there in
that README file since September 2001.
