Hi
Since early 2.6.25 days I'm having strange lockup on boot. As it happens
rarely (in ~10% of boots), I couldn't bisect it. No kernel panic, SysRq
didn't work, so I couldn't provide any useful informations to LK community.
I hoped someone else would fix it... :)
It's rc3 so I decided to narrow it down myself. I enabled netconsole 
to see whether some other informations are printed before lockup.
It didn't help, but I noticed that lockup happens much more frequenly! (~50%)
So I bisected it down to:
8f4d37ec073c17e2d4aa8851df5837d798606d6f is first bad commit
commit 8f4d37ec073c17e2d4aa8851df5837d798606d6f

    sched: high-res preemption tick
    Use HR-timers (when available) to deliver an accurate preemption tick.
    The regular scheduler tick that runs at 1/HZ can be too coarse when nice
    level are used. The fairness system will still keep the cpu utilisation 'fair'
    by then delaying the task that got an excessive amount of CPU time but try to
    minimize this by delivering preemption points spot-on.
    The average frequency of this extra interrupt is sched_latency / nr_latency.
    Which need not be higher than 1/HZ, its just that the distribution within the
    sched_latency period is important.

I can't revert it on top of rc3 because of conflicts.
Usually my boot looks like this (it's Gentoo with RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP="yes"):
INIT: Entering runlevel: 3
 * Service net.eth0 starting
 * Service metalog starting
 * Service net.eth1 starting
 * Service acpid starting
 * Service netmount starting
 * Service xdm starting
 * Service cpudyn starting
 * Service rdate starting
 * Service vixie-cron starting
 * Service local starting
 * Service cpudyn started
 * Service metalog started
 * Service acpid started
 * Service net.eth0 started
--------------------------------------- lockup usually here, but sometimes later 
 * Service net.eth1 started
 * Service netmount started
 * Service rdate started
 * Service vixie-cron started
 * Service xdm started
 * Service local started
Successful boot:
