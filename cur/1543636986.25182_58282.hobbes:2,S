Trailing comma in enums has _exactly_ the same status as .foo = bar in
structure initializers.  Both appear in C99 and were compiler-specific
extensions before that.
If -pedantic is unhappy about one but not another - take it with gcc
folks, it's a bug in gcc.
Speaking of GNUisms, inline assembler is one and it's by far the worst
obstacle to portability.  Speaking of *REALLY* ugly stuff - may I point
you to abuses of ##?  Yes, it's legal C.  No, using it is a Bad Idea(tm).
And the actual uses of _that_ one in the tree can give you the second
look at your breakfast - grep around and you'll see.
