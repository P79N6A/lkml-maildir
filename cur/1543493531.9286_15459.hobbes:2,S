This is unlikely to be a usable solution. The problem is the crisis
recovery mode of the BIOS is required only to run a very basic DOS setup
and a re-Flashing program. This means there is no requirement for all the
memory to be setup (or to be setup for best performance), for the caches
to be turned on, or for the CPU to be run at it's normal speed. If you
have a PCI/AGP video card, it may not even be initialised. The boot block
might only be 8/16K in size, and this means the boot block BIOS is cut
down to the very bare essentials to do crisis recovery.
Shame though as this would otherwise be quite cool ...
