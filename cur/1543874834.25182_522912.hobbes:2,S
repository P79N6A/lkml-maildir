Hi Avi!
	Not sure what you're saying about the prototype: the old macro was:
-#define rdmsr(msr,val1,val2) \
-	__asm__ __volatile__("rdmsr" \
-			  : "=a" (val1), "=d" (val2) \
-			  : "c" (msr))
-
Which doesn't seem to be a great difference to me.
The behaviour change (don't oops when an invalid rdmsr is used) was
there with CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y, the cleanup just made !CONFIG_PARAVIRT the
same.  Is it important?
Thanks,
Rusty.
