Yeah I know - it just so happened that you got *worse*
performance from Ingo's balance-on-clone than by simply
decreasing the balancing interval just now :P
Although it is probably just because balance-on-clone is
not tuned well.
I've said all along that it will probably be a good thing
to do if it is implemented correctly, but 1. we need some
good numbers, and 2. let's not stuff it in at the same
time sched-domains goes in because it is a fundamentally
different concept.
