jeff, why not put some sample code in prominent public places
(kernel.org, or perhaps more appropriately kernelnewbies.org) that
provides examples of sane module code, since that appears to be
the problem here.
i ask you since i have a vague recollection of you mentioning
macro-fying all the nic drivers with m4 a while back, and to do this you
must have had some sort of basic skeleton to flesh out.
it won't help the idiots, but it may help people who are less than
intimate with the rules and regulations of lunix module authoring
(perhaps having come from a different OS).
