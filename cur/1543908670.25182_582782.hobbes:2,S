I *had* applied the patch series, Andi. And that one will do
	memcpy(addr, opcode, len);
even though "addr" itself may be all of memcpy().
So the code was buggy, and Petr fixed it, and your patch-series didn't fix 
*anything*. In fact, from what I can tell, it's the one that introduced 
the problem, because before thatone hit, we'd always do the two-byte 
sequence on its own (since the "nop_out()" on the rest of the memcpy would 
be called later, and separately, once it didn't matter any more).
So out of 12 patches, 2 caused machines to not even boot. Not good.
