I added a few functions to my test-bed to see how well the LZO code coped with 
random input data. I'll extend my error checking so that it dumps all local 
variables at the first error, but for the time being I'm staring at a problem 
with what appears to be a double-free (in addition to lzo1x_decompress(_safe) 
screaming about overruns when I pass it the buffer of compressed, totally 
random data).
(I fill the buffer by doing a read from /dev/urandom, though I'll certainly 
change it to use random() if anyone thinks that'll make a difference)
I'll post the version with the random-data tests when I get the double-free 
solved. (I've looked and don't see how its happening)
