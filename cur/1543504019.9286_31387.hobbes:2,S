just about anything can be reversed engineered... and believe it or not lots of
companies do it to others people products.. how do you think Microsoft got where
it is today?.. the reverse engineered the Mac, added more bugs, and tada.. they
have what they call an 'operating system'.. and today I had to reboot the system
5 times to get the taskbar to come back.. and they say there operating increases
productivity..

news flash Corel was nt always so open. they opened up as a last resort kind of
thing.. they were going down because of M$ , there product WordPerfect which is
just as good as Word, both have there + and - but for the average Joe (and that
would be me) either will do.. however Corel / WP were loosing the desktop battle
for Wordprocessor.  Even though many people I have chatted with prefer WP over
Word many still continue using that blasted Word crapola program. as Linux grew
and grows Corel see/saw it as a potential for a possible comeback..so who here
actually runs ON LINUX anything by Corel other than there WordPerfect?

and on that Note I'll be buying an APC .. not because there better not cause of
the support.. but cause I can get one at Best Buy on the way home from work for
the same price that is on the apc web site..
