Exactly the same experiences here, with 2 different motherboards and 2 
different CD-RW drives, with various stock kernels since 2.4.9 or so. 
Exactly the same resolution too, kill magicdev, and everything works 
fine.
My machine would sometimes survive slightly longer, usually locking up 
during fixating a disc. It would typically spit out massive amounts of 
SCSI and IDE errors, while effectively locking up the machine for, what 
at first was about 10 seconds at a time with a split second in an 
unlocked state, but that would eventually worsen into a permanently 
hard-locked state. 
Curiously enough, doing hdparm -y /dev/hdb (the cd burner), during one 
of those split second unlocked states, would usually save the system. 
It became standard practice for me to have an xterm su'd, in focus and 
ready with "hdparm -y /dev/hdb" in it, while wiggling the mouse to see 
when the pointer would freeze, to hit enter when/if it unfroze again 8-)
