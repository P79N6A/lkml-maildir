I dont know exactly which scenario Hannes has seen, but its quite simple to 
trigger this scenario with almost any s390/zSeries.
Using the Hardware Management Console or z/VM you are able to hotplug 
(deactive/activate/attach/detach) almost every channel path. As a channel 
path can connect a big bunch of devices lots of machine checks are 
triggered, which causes lots of hotplugs. The same amount of machine checks 
could happen if a hardware failure happens. 
Some month ago I played around with a diet version of  hotplug. This program 
was fast and small enough to make my scenario work properly. Nevertheless, 
as hannes already stated this will only delay the problem. 
cheers
