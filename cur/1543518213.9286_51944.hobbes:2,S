It does if you are a source based OS because we have the ability to use our
source based nature to gain performance. spin_lock() takes 0 clocks on Linux
non SMP. spin_lock_irqsave becomes about 3 instructions. This is good

Vendors I can think of off hand who have contributed driver code directly
to Linux kernels - and this isnt counting those who gave engineering time, docs
and hardware (eg Adaptec, Fujitsu etc) or those who just provided stuff for 
X11 etc
Cyclades, Advansys, Acard, Computone, Intel, IBM, Compaq, Digi Intl, 
Sangoma, Syskonnect, GDT, DPT, HP, SGI, Creative Labs, SiS, Specialix, 
Stallion, SAP, CMI, Symbios(now LSI), Davicom, AMI ...
And Im sure I missed some.

Matrox provide a lot of documentation. Matrox help the XFree people. In cases
where Matrox have problems with stuff they think is genuinely 'neat' and gives
them an edge they've worked with the community to help.

I've not seen Marvel docs. It may be matrox actually bought it from someone else
