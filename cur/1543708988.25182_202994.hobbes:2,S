**BINGO**
Excellent.  patch03 has stopped the timeouts.  I have just tested.  I 
moved (via ftp) a 30MB file from network -> eth0, and at the same 
time downloaded a 30MB file (via httpd) from the Internet -> eth1.
I was getting 10Mbs internal, and 30Kbs external (as expected).  NO 
TIMEOUTS :) :)
Before, just the internal FTP timed out in 5 seconds.
dmesg is basically very quiet:

I haven't applied patch04.
I will continue to run the debug kernel.
Thank you :)
