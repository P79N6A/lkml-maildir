Not so much worried about that. More about how sensitive they would be to 
something _else_ causing the eventd thread to sleep for 'multiple seconds' 
before getting round to doing what they asked.
I really don't want to have to start using multiple eventd threads before
2.5, if at all. So I don't want to add the USB hub stuff unless the other
queued tasks will be happy with that.
