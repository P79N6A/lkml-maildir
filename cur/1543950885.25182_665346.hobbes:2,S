Ok, I'll await your patch that switches default_policy.policy to 
MPOL_PREFERRED.
Using MPOL_DEFAULT purely for falling back to the task or system-wide 
policy, however, seems confusing.  The semantics seem to indicate that 
MPOL_DEFAULT represents the system-wide default policy without any 
preferred node or set of nodes to bind or interleave.  So if a VMA has a 
policy of MPOL_DEFAULT then, to me, it seems like that indicates the 
absence of a specific policy, not a mandate to fallback to the task 
policy.
