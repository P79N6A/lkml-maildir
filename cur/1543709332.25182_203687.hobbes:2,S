I am having the same problem as David but with a major difference, the
keyboard doesn't have any problems on either 2.4.21 or windows XP, it
works flawlessly there. I have tested up to 2.6.2 and haven't seen
anything in the changelogs that suggests its fixed in 2.6.3

I used the exact same steps and the result is the same, the machine is
dead, and I can do a hard reset.

See the attached dmesg file I get one error more. On top of that I have
enabled usb debugging so perhaps the dmesg file yields more result when
someone who knows this subsystem can see what is happening here.
Personally I lack the experience to fix this problem. When you need any
more information I'll be happy to provide it.
One thing to note though is that I do have usb legacy mode turned on,
because I otherwise cannot boot into linux.
