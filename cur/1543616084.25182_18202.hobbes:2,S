I understand that you've tested upto and including 2.4.16 but that kernel
oops information is a bit dated. Please reproduce with latest 2.4.18-pre
and submit a decoded oops.

Although you're not overclocking your CPU, you're actually overclocking
most of the busses on your system now...

Thats because you were running an overclocked FSB, your L2 runs at a
multiple of your FSB. L2 caches are very delicate especially when
overclocked. E.g. I have a CPU (C366) which can do 600Mhz stable with the
L2 disabled and only 577 with it enabled. But losing your L2 cache slows
things _considerably_. Try running memtest86 (I believe it tests caches as
well), this definately sounds like hardware problems.
