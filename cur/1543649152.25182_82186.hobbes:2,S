I think the underlying subsystem does not easily allow for dynamic regeneration, so it's non-trivial. wli was looking at doing pagetable reclaim at some point, IIRC.
IMHO, it's better not to fill memory with crap in the first place than
to invent complex methods of managing and shrinking it afterwards. You
only get into pathalogical conditions under sharing situation, else 
it's limited to about 1% of RAM (bad, but manageable) ... thus providing
this sort of sharing nixes the worst of it. Better cache warmth on 
switches (for TLB misses), faster fork+exec, etc. are nice side-effects.
The ultimate solution is per-object reverse mappings, rather than per
page, but that's a 2.7 thingy now.
