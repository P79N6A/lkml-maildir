Well, it's not really a dereference issue.  The function, cpu_to_node() 
just returns an integer which is the node that particular CPU is on. 
This should always return a valid value.  This is used in many places, 
often as a direct index into an array, and we shouldn't have to check 
its return value everywhere.  The default behavior is to just return 0, 
because 0 is a valid node, even for UP/SMP.  The array of CPU -> node 
mappings is initialized to 0's on i386 already, so unmapping a CPU 
should return this mapping to its uninitialized state.
Cheers!
