Why wouldn't this simply be transparent from what devices Linux detects?
If Linux doesn't detect any raw PCI devices, then it obviously doesn't
have access to any.
Why don't any other hypervisors need this?

There are definitely things that are exceedingly helpful.  However,
there are at least two other hypervisor-ish things that I can think of
which do the exact same kinds of things.  Perhaps it would be helpful to
collaborate with them and produce a common interface. (uml, s390, maybe
some of the powerpc hypervisors)

Other than debugging and curiosity, why are these things needed?
