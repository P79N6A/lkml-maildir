Actually no.  The conclusion of that thread was something like common OTS
IDE components aren't hot swappable, because even if we ignore the bus shock
problem and the controller supports proper power down, the hard disk
probabily won't.
Considering Roy is asking about specific hardware its not of much relevance
overall.
