They semed very sad that they had damaged their relationship with me,
and Linda was more concerned as to whether I was still angry at them
more so than any issues with their IP.  I really like a lot of the folks
who work up there, particularly Jim Allchin and David Geobel (and Dan
Neault -- he's really a great guy)  and I think they did not like the
idea that one of their golden geese might fly away forever.  I am happy
to work with them moving forward.  I just don't respond well to threats,
and never have -- but who does.
They are really stressed up there right now with the DOJ stuff and
everything that's happenned, and I think the whole Linux thing is also
getting them down.   We'll see where it goes, but I am gad they are
doing what's right here and putting their customers first.  If an
MS customer wnats to use Linux and W2K, they should be helping them, and
I think perhaps they have come to realize this now.
