I have a tool that will repair the damage caused to an NTFS volume by 
Linux.  Questions:
1.  Did you boot NT on the drive and did it become RAW?
2.  Have you run checkdisk against the drive, and if so, what happened?
If you answer yes to #1, you have probably already experienced permanent
data loss on the device.  Older NTFS versions on Linux would make changes
to the MFT without clearing the old journal file, then leave the drive
marked as "clean" to NT.  What can happen in this case is that NTFS 
on W2K will see the logfile, then attempt to roll out the changes.  In NT
the MFT is updated real time and the logfile is transacted after the fact.
This can (but not always) cause massive data loss on NTFS drives.  Anton
has fixed a lot of these issues on the newer code, but Linux NTFS
is still a very dangerous piece of software to use R/W (R/O works 
OK).
Do you need this tool?
