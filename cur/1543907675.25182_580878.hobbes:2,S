Hi,
I see there is a bit of complaining on this original resend temporary
patch. But, since it seems to do a good job for some people, here is
my proposal to limit the 'range of fire' a little bit.
Marcin and Jean-Baptiste: try to test this with 2.6.23-rc2, please.
(Unless Ingo or Thomas have other plans with this problem?)
Thanks,
Jarek P.

Subject: [patch] genirq: temporary fix for level-triggered IRQ resend
Marcin Slusarz reported a ne2k-pci "hung network interface" regression.
delayed disable relies on the ability to re-trigger the interrupt in the
case that a real interrupt happens after the software disable was set.
In this case we actually disable the interrupt on the hardware level
_after_ it occurred.
On enable_irq, we need to re-trigger the interrupt. On i386 this relies
on a hardware resend mechanism (send_IPI_self()).
Actually we only need the resend for edge type interrupts. Level type
interrupts come back once enable_irq() re-enables the interrupt line.
Marcin found that when he disables the irq line on the hardware level
(removing the delayed disable) the card is kept alive.
Thomas Gleixner prepared a testing patch which proved to fix hung ups
after limiting irqs resending to edge type only. Then Ingo Molnar's
version of this patch was applied to 2.6.23-rc2 kernel as a temporary
solution. Since, the problem is still diagnosed, but seems to affect
mainly X86_64 arch, here is a modified, but still temporary, version of
this solution, which should limit the range of warnings and changes in
interrupt handling to minimum.
