FYI.
Partition types 0x66 and 0x67 are used as follows:
0x66 Wolf Mountain Segment Cache Partition
0x67 Wolf Mountain Archive Cache Partition/Routing Partition
These types have been used since 1995 for this architecture.  Info 
provided for update of partition
utilities folks.  I note they already appear to be reserved.  I am 
providing what they are reserved for
in this notice.
