I don't see why...OS X had a default limit of 100 processes per uid (increased
to 266 in 10.5) and "it works" (many people notices it, but it's not surprising
since the limit is too restrictive).
If you don't have limits, you can't avoid starvation easily. From my experience,
since I use CFS, fork/compile bombs (forgetting to put a number after make -j...)
are very sluggish mainly because the whole graphic subsystem is paged out.
