Please see Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt; especially the part starting
at "There are two types of DMA mappings..."  Ring buffers are allocated
as "consistent" DMA memory.
For most architectures this will mean that the cache hardware snoops the
PCI bus and automatically invalidates cache lines as they are written to.
For architectures that can't do that then Linux will mark those memory
regions uncacheable.
