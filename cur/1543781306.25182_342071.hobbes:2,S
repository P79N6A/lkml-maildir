Yes.  This *is* a very special narrow case.  This doesn't really apply
to a desktop machine, nor to a normal unix server load.
It *does* apply to cleaning up a node (or set of nodes) before running HPC
apps which really need to get local memory to perform correctly.
I'm not suggesting that this is something useful for your average
computer, but it is a feature that would make life a lot easier on big
machines running HPC apps.
The memhog approach works, but it may negatively impact the performance
of other jobs on the same node (by swapping or needlessly forcing the
node into memory reclaim and dirty page writeback).

I did this to test out the memhog method.

This is what we need:  a better level of control over how NUMA
allocations work.  In some cases we *really* would prefer local pages,
even at the cost of page cache.
It does have the potential to make the fast path slower.  Some workloads
are willing to make this sacrifice.
