The problem is this.  If you have an embedded system that is headless, diskless, keyboardless, and
mouseless, then your only remaining source of any interrupt-based entropy is the network.  Also, if
you add entropy to the pool without accounting it as entropy, then how does that help anything?  You
can currently add anything you want to the pool and it will stir it in but not bump the entropy
count.
Granted, a proper solution would involve a hardware-based system for entropy generation, but in the
absence of a proper solution you do the best you can.
For the general user, network-based interrupts are likely okay.  If you have an attacker
sophisticated enough that it can predict the arrival time of a network packet down to 30ns (the
timing of a 33MHz PCI bus) from across the network, then I think you will probably have the
resources for a hardware entropy generator.
This has been discussed many times, and the concensus seems to be that yes it is not secure, but
there are people who have literally no other option.
