I really think that doing this over zones and pgdats isn't the best approach.
You're going to make memory allocation and reclaim vastly less efficient,
and you're exposing a bunch of very specialised code inside the main
memory paths. 
Have you looked at Daniel's CONFIG_NONLINEAR stuff? That provides a much
cleaner abstraction for getting rid of discontiguous memory in the non
truly-NUMA case, and should work really well for doing mem hot add / remove
as well.

PS. What's this bit of the patch for?
 void *vmalloc(unsigned long size)
 {
+#ifdef CONFIG_MEMHOTPLUGTEST
+       return __vmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL, PAGE_KERNEL);
+#else
        return __vmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_HIGHMEM, PAGE_KERNEL);
+#endif
 }
