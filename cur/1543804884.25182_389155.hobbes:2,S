Hi!
when viewing the differences between kernel 2.4.29 to 2.4.32,I wondered whether 
these lines (with nothing in between) make any sense:
      write_lock_irqsave(&bfusb->lock, flags);
      write_unlock_irqrestore(&bfusb->lock, flags);
      /* Synchronize with completion handlers */
      write_lock_irqsave(&husb->completion_lock, flags);
      write_unlock_irqrestore(&husb->completion_lock, flags);
See attached diffs for more detail.
Regards,
Ulrich
