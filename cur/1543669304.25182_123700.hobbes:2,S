I am running 2.4.18 kernel for ARM. I have one of the boot parameters
"profile=2". The size of the /proc/profile file is shown as 16MB. But when I
execute "readprofile" the output is ...  
0 total                                         nan
If I cat the file it just give me a ".". Can anyone suggest what i am doing
wrong?
