And it's not even about writecombine... Like writecombine is an
attribute of the PCI host bridge on pmacs, not a pgprot, while
cacheability issues cannot be always abstracted the same way on
different archs. Actually, GUARDED could be used for !writecombine
on ppc, but !GUARDED would allow prefetch and out of order IOs....
