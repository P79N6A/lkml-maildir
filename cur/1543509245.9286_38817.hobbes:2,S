Don't worry about the CC list.  This issue overrides all.
There are a few quirks I found last night.
AGP Card Slot
PCI 1	PDC20246: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78 hdm/n/o/p
PCI 2	PDC20246: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 68 hdi/j/k/l
PCI 3	PDC20246: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 58 hde/f/g/h
PCI 4
PCI 5
Update "2.2.12.uniform-ide-6.20.hydra.patch.gz" to straight
"ide.2.2.12.patch.gz"
There is a change or two that enables a flag or two.
Next move card in pci slot 3 to slot 4.
Next turn off the irq in the BIOS for the AGP video.
Due to the pci-irq routing table design, there is a potential mess.
Some of this is not documented in the shipped manual.
		: PIRQ 0 : PIRQ 1 : PIRQ 2 : PIRQ 3 : PIRQ 4
AGP & Slot 1	:   A    :   B    :   C    :   D    :   ?
Slot 2		:   D    :   A    :   B    :   C    :   ?
Slot 3 & HPT366	:   C    :   D    :   A    :   B    :   ?
Slot 4 & Slot 5	:   B    :   C    :   D    :   A    :   ?

I am not sure if the kernel will mix shared interrupts yet of this nature.
If you move the primary Promise card to slot 4 and repeat the test,
it will tell me if it is in the ide-driver core or in the chipset.
I suspect the former and not the later.
If this is the case, the hunt may expand to other parts of the kernel
down to the "arch" specific handling.
The next test (dangerous) is to pair off two cards into slots 4 and 5.
This will verify it is not chipset, but driver core.
If this more than you want to try I understand, I just need a quick class
in raid setup (had not planned to do this yet) so I can use my drives that
are for testing, wrecking, and trashing.  I have the Promise cards and
access to Promise's engineers.  I managed to find the one assigned to
"Linux".

This makes me think it is more than chipset specific and in the
request/services against a mainboard design.  A quirk....

Again, these are not overlapped in the irqs.

Not needed, found them.
