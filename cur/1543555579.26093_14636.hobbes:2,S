Ok.
The thing was marked as edge-triggered, which is basically always wrong
for a PCI interrupt. The above printout just means that it now noticed
that it was edge, and fixed it up in the ELCR.

That's why they pay me the big bucks. Good.
I'll make it do the eisa_set_level_irq() in the generic code: it should
always be right (we don't do it now in the PIIX4 case, for example, but
the PIIX documentation actually says that we _should_), and there is no
need to do it separately for each interrupt router.
One down.
Now just tell me if the problem with the machine that needs warm-booting
from Windows is fixed by the other PCI change, and I'll be a happy camper.
(Or rather, I'd be a happy camper if I knew what the cause of the disk
corruption reports is. That one bugs me).
