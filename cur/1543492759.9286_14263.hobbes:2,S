Very good point.

Not quite. Because only one of the uids in the array would have been
considered root at a given time. And of coarse, no normal user would have
been given one of these uids.
The main exploit I was aiming to disable was as a matter of fact an nfs
expoit. And I was planning to disallow root access over nfs unless a given
user had the right uid.
It would have been fun, but I've learned from some replys that this would
have not been a good idea to start with.

Well, the point of this would have been for the system to keep the special
uid transparent to the application layer. As most of the access control is
beeing done by the kernel anyway.

Hmm, the point of writting this mail was to get some feedback from
hardcore kackers. While I will not insist on writting this, I still
beleive that it could have been done in a secure way (anyway, what is so
special about the number 0).
Maybe I don't know everything about UNIX security, but I guess we all have
to start somewhere. While I have been using UNIX/Linux for a few years and
don't consider myself a beginner or an expert, I do know enough about OSs
and C programming to do something usefull for Linux.
As it is impossible to know everything in computer sciences, I don't think
it is appropriate to insult people like this. I am learning from these
replys, and maybe in a few years I hope to be some help to some, or maybe
just one of you. Untill then, I beleive that it is possible to point to
some weaknesses without insulting me so bad. Unless, of coarse, you've
been born with your UNIX skills, remember that you are just an
ex-beginner/intermidiate/good/very good/etc UNIX user.
