This was my thought too last time we had this discussion.  A completely 
asynchronous call is probably needed in addition to Hidetoshi's proposed API, 
since as you point out, the driver may not be running when an error occurs 
(e.g. in the case of a DMA error or more general bus problem).  The async 
->error callback could do a total reset of the card, or something along those 
lines as Jeff suggests, while the inline ioerr_clear/ioerr_check API could 
potentially deal with errors as they happen (probably in the case of PIO 
related errors), when the additional context may allow us to be smarter about 
recovery.
