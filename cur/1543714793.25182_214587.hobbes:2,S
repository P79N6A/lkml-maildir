Or you could skip the extra section, and keep all the module memory
until later.  Instead of a section marker, you then set the release of
those static things to "static_release" which does the put on the module
memory kref:
void static_release(struct kobject *kobj)
{
	struct module *mod;
	down(&module_mutex);
	list_for_each_entry(mod, &modules, list) {
		BUG_ON(within(kobj, mod->module_init, mod->init_size);
		if (within(kobj, mod->module_core, mod->core_size)) {
			kref_put(&mod->mem_kref);
			up(&module_mutex);
			return;
		}
	}
	up(&module_mutex);
	BUG();
}
One question which comes to mind, who does the original kref_get()s on
the module memory?  Even if we did have a separate section, the module
loader can't know how many objects objects are in there...
Cheers,
Rusty.
