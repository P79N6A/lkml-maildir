ata_generic.c assumes the BIOS set up the timings and the device follows
PCI SFF. In those cases it already correctly handles PIO only
controllers.
If you are trying to write a driver for a non PCI motherboard device (Eg
on an embedded board) then drivers/ata/pata_qdi.c may be a better
example to follow as it sets up all the device ports by hand as a
platform device.
If you want PIO only then don't provide mwdma or udma mode masks in the
ata_port_info.
