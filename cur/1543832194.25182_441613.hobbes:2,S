Andrew,
If this patch is so much affecting Garzik, please drop it.
As to "merged users in the kernel" -- my code is GPL, and at one point
was in the -mm tree as maintained by yourself.
Currently it also implements a SAT-r08a complient SCSI/ATA Translation
Layer for a SAS Stack including SATA capabilities adjustment as advertized
by the protocol, NCQ, passthrough, etc, etc. (Garzik may see this as
objectionable as it is not "libata", but it cannot be due to architectural
hurdles.)
Anyway, kernel threads bear the name of STP/SATA bridge which is representable
in 16+1 ASCII chars (IEEE NAA Registered format identifier, 8 bytes), and thus
the last character (4 bits of the name) are chopped off in a 15+1 char array.
So in effect, a kernel thread can be (WW-) uniquely identified with the device
it services.
In the (near) future, I can see other protocols wanting TASK_COMM_LEN to be larger
to accomodate this (e.g. any protocol which allows for IEEE NAA names).
Thank you for your time,
    Luben
