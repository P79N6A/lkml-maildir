Ok, I'll provide updated patches for -mm ASAP.

Just to avoid any misunderstanding (I (really) understand your point about 
performance issue), but:
* the problem I mention about several futexes hashed on the same key, and thus 
with all potential waiters listed on the same list, is _not_ a new problem which 
comes with this patch: it already exists today, with simple list.
* the measures of performance done with pthread_broadcast (and thus with 
futex_requeue) is a good choice (well, may be not realistic, when considering 
real applications (*)) to put in evidence the performance impact, rather than 
threads making FUTEX_WAIT/FUTEX_WAKE: what is expensive with plist is the 
plist_add operation (which occurs in FUTEX_WAIT), not plist_del (which occurs 
during FUTEX_WAKE => thus, no big impact should be noticed here). Any measure 
will be difficult to do with only FUTEX_WAIT/WAKE.
=> futex_requeue does as many plist_del/plist_add operations as the number of 
threads waiting (minus 1), and thus has a direct impact on the time needed to 
wake everybody (or to wake the first thread to be more precise).
(*) I'll try the volano bench, if I have time.
