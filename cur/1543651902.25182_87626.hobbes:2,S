  Cmd line: tar zxf ~/linux-2.5.46.tar.gz && cd linux-2.5.46 && tar zxf
~/linux-2.5.46.tar.gz && cd ../ && strace rm -rf linux-2.5.46/ 2>
~/rm.log  && ls -al
  I think this last ls is what gave me a segfault when this command
completed.
  The last 'ls' is because I wanted to see if a linux-2.5.46/ directory
remained unremoved, as once before a subdir went untouched, I was trying
to duplicate that situation.  I also had 1000000 empty files in that
directory, recently created.  The oops is in the attached dmesg.log.
