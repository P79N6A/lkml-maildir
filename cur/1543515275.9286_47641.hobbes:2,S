Hello, world!\n
   I'm currently writting my own database library (a much faster alternative
to GDBM) and I want to sort file accesses before feeding them to the kernel,
so that they will be executed in linear sector order and seek time will be
minimized. Unfortunately, this plan breaks on the FIBMAP ioctl requiring
CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability. To be honest, I don't see why -- can the kernel
gurus advise me what deep reasons are behind this restriction?
				Have a nice fortnight
