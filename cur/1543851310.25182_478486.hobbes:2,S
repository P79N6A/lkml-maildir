Christoph objected very strongly to my bypassing of vfs_mkdir() and co, and Al
wasn't to happy about it either.  This should allow me, for example, to call
vfs_mkdir() rather than calling the inode op directly as the reason I wasn't
was that I was having to avoid the security checks it made.

That's what Karl said to use.

I've no idea.  I tried to find out how to use this function from Karl, but he
said I should ask on the list.

I could do that.  Does it actually gain anything?  Or are there good reasons
for not altering current->security->sid?  For instance, does that affect the
label seen on /proc/pid/ files?

I could do that too.

Sorry, I meant that a process can only change its own security label if it's a
single-threaded process.  A kernel module can, of course, change the security
label at any time.

Okay... that seems like a good reason to do use the ->fssid approach.  How do I
tell if ->fssid is set?  Is zero usable as 'unset'?  Alternatively, would it be
reasonable to have ->fssid track ->sid when the latter changes?
