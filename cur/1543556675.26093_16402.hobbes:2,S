Actually it should be 'unsigned long'.  If anyone uses 'long' or 'int',
I guess it's a bug.

Yeah, tell the world you explicitly don't support 32-bit architectures.
Linux supports (to some degree) at least four 64-bit architectures,
where 'unsigned long' is nice and big.  And I imagine support for
POWER3 and HP-PA 2.0w are coming in the not-so-distant future.
Either that, or (since you say the address space is sparse) do your own
block mapping within the driver.  If you still need more than 32 bits,
you'll have to fudge it with multiple virtual devices.

A couple of terabytes is fine.  That's 32 bits of blocks.  *More* than
that, now, we've got a problem.
