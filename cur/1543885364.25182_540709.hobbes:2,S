Yes, of course. If we're heading to yet-another monolitic interface, we're 
heading with no valid reasons given if other than some handwaving. While 
there are quite a few (modularity, compatibilty, plus the other ones that 
came in my mind and that I explained in the way-too-many emails) to back a 
file-based approach.
Conversation with Uli, as often happen when arguing about software, got 
stuck. And since noone else seems interested in bringing valid points in 
one way or another, I'll leave the discussion as is, and I'll let you sort 
it out.
