Well yes, cue long story about vm flushing acting up with longer
queues...

I think there are two sides to this. One is that some devices just dont
ever need long queues. For a floppy and cdrom, it's just a huge waste of
memory, they should always just limited to a few entries. Some devices
might benefit from nice long queues, we want to give them the option of
having them. That's the hardware side, and I suspect such hints are best
passed in by the drivers. Probably by specifying device class.
Then there's the vm side, where we don't want to waste large amounts of
memory on requests... So based on the class of a device, select a
default depth that fits with the current system.
But yes, definitely needs to be tweakable.
