IIRC it worked for us with Davicom PHY on 10 MBps on one of 8260-like...
Well I give it a try once more with the recent kernel, but anyway if you think 
you've located and fixed root cause, do (and test) a patch against recent kernel,
send it to me cc'ing netdev and linuxppc-embedded, and I'll push it along
if it is not breaking existing boards.
