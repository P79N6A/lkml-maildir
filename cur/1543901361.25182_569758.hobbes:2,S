Holy sh*t. There is not even a functional replacement ready, but still
everybody wants to remove /proc/acpi. (Maybe the replacement started
to work recently, i have not looked into this area for the last months.
This does not change my pint, though).
This is not going to work.
IMNSHO, we need the new interface available and usable for quite some time
(i'd say for over one year), and then we can start to phase out the old
interface.
Starting with removing /proc/acpi is not the correct ordering of actions.

Or they look at the feature-removal document, find out that there is
no replacement available and conclude "the writers of this document
must have been on crack, or this document is unmaintained". I cannot
disagree with them.
