DVD drive not recognized
The ata_piix SATA driver grabs ownership over the IDE ports when it is 
loaded, but (by default) does not support PATA ATAPI devices such as the 
Ultrabay optical drives. Thus, if the ide driver is compiled as a module 
and loaded after ata_piix, the DVD drive will not be recognized by either 
driver.
Either of the following configurations will work:
     * For kernel 2.6.14 and newer: enable ATAPI support in the SATA system 
using libata.atapi_enabled=1 (see below; this is experimental).
     * Compile IDE into the kernel (non-module).
     * Compile both IDE and SATA as modules and make sure IDE is loaded 
first (the module is called 'ide_generic').
Note that the optical drive must be in the Ultrabay during system boot 
(Ultrabay device swapping is currently unsupported).
