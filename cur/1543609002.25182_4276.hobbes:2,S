   jiffies cleanup patch of the day follows. Mostly boring changes of jiffies
   comparisons to use time_{before,after} in order to handle jiffies
   wraparound correctly.
These cases handle wraparound correctly!!!!
Please stop sending these changes, start thinking about what the
code is doing.
It is comparing a "DIFFERRENCE" not raw jiffy values with each other.
It works just fine.
Franks a lot,
