Well, we definitely don't want to crash them. It's hard to gain sympathy
for Linux that way ("Hey, our servers crash when we connect Linux clients
to them, but it works fine with Solaris, *BSD, Irix, etc.")
I don't think it's auto-detectable (I doubt that the servers will tell you
in the negotiation "hey mister, I'm a buggy server"
