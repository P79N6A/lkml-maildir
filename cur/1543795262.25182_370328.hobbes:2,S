I think this came about on a linux-ia64 thread started by Jack Steiner:

  Subject: per_cpu_pagesets degrades MPI performance
  From: Jack Steiner <steiner_at_sgi.com>

Jack reported that per_cpu_pagesets were degrading some MPI benchmarks due
to adverse page coloring.  Nick responded, recommending a non-power of two
batch size.  Jack found that this helped nicely.  This thread trails off,
but seems to be the origins of the 2**n-1 batch size in:
	mm/page_alloc.c:zone_batchsize()
	 * Clamp the batch to a 2^n - 1 value. Having a power ...
        batch = (1 << fls(batch + batch/2)) - 1;
I don't see here evidence that "per_cpu_pagelist is ... one single main
reason the coloring effect is drastically reduced in 2.6 (over 2.4)
based kernels."  Rather in this case anyway a batch size not a power of
two was apparently needed to keep per_cpu_pagesets from hurting
performance due to page coloring affects on some workloads.
