you can also go for option #0: just replace the existing RCU code with
the new one, and i'll then deal with the configuration details.
what will have to happen is most likely #2 (since there is near zero
code sharing between the two variants, right?). Picking rcupdate_rt.c is
as simple as doing this:
 obj-$(CONFIG_DONT_PREEMPT_RCU) += rcupdate.o
 obj-$(CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU) += rcupdate_rt.o
and then use Kconfig to generate either CONFIG_DONT_PREEMPT_RCU
(default) or CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU (if the user selects it).
but it's not yet clear whether we want to offer this to users as a
configurable option. The simplest solution for you would be to go with
option #0 :-) [or if you prefer switchability, #1 is good too - i can
then extract the bits and do #2 based on that.]

yeah, i'd not worry about OOM that much at this stage.

sure. This is in fact easier for me: i'll first rip all my RCU hackery
out of -RT and then add your code, so the base i'll be merging against
will be closer to upstream than to current -RT.
