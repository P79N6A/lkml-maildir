Well, the ACPI sysfs conversion is not finished yet
and some user space tools still use the ACPI procfs.
The schedule of removing ACPI procfs I/F will be changed to Jan 08.
I'm about to send a patch to update it.
I'm not sure if the button sysfs I/F is already finished.
We'd better make a double check. :)
Thanks,
Rui

First, because refering to /Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt it should be done:

Second, refering to /Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt

The button driver uses acpi_root_dir which won't be available if acpi is removed this month.
That would lead to errors, I think.
