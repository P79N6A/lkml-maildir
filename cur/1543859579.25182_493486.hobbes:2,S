Generally, when you get this on scripts written in such "high level"
languages, this is because you fill variables with a file which does
not fit into memory. I have often seen this in people's perl scripts,
and sometimes even in shell scripts. Eg: 
  count=$(cat file)
Where file is unexpectedly big, or even a link to /dev/zero. This is
an excellent OOM trigger.
You can use ulimit (man bash) to limit the amount of memory your script
can use. At least it will not make the system go ill.
Regards,
Willy
