Unless you can write to the disk faster than fetch data from /dev/zero - 
yes, it is normal.
BTW, it doesn't mean that your CPU's cycles are wasted. You will see big 
"wa" numbers when there are no other tasks to schedule at the same time.
Try running:
   cat /dev/zero | bzip2 -c >/dev/null
when your IOwait is big (because you write a big file), and then watch 
the numbers.
