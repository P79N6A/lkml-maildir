Great!

Sounds easy.

Actually, backing up from within the normal kernel may produce 
inter-dependency deadlocks.  It's much better to just force-free some memory 
chunk out to swap.

What about CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=y ?
Also CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=1000000 (=16M instead of default 1M).

Ok, booted with crashkernel=16M@16M.

Ok.

You mean like:
# kexec -p vmlinux 
        --args-linux 
        --append="root=/dev/sda1 
                  kexec_jump_buf_pfn = `cat /sys/kernel/kexec_jump_buf_pfn`"
# cat c > /proc/sysrq
This loads ok.

Ok.

This doesn't switch it, but rather reboots my machine.
Thanks!
