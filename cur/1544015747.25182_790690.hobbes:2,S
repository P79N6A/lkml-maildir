Btw, even if you probably had some reason for this, one thing to note is 
that I think Chris' performance testing showed that the version using a 
lock was inferior to his local btrfs hack, while the unlocked version 
actually beat his hack.
Maybe I misunderstood his numbers, though. But if I followed that sub-part 
of the test right, it really means that the locked version is pointless - 
it will never be able to replace peoples local hacks for this same thing, 
because it just doesn't give the performance people are looking for.
Since the whole (and _only_) point of this thing is to perform well, 
that's a big deal.
