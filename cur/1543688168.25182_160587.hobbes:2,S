can you please retest with -test4 and russell's yenta patches?
http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/pcmcia/yenta-20030817.tar
if that doesn't work out: could you please add these lines to in yenta_socket.c?
in yenta_events(), before return:
printk("yenta_events: socket %p, cb: %x, csc: %x\n", socket, cb_event, csc);
in yenta_get_status(), before return:
printk("yenta_get_status: socket %p, state: %x\n", socket, state);
and then report the output on boot, when removig, inserting, cardctl eject, cardctl insert?
this could give an idea what's going on....
