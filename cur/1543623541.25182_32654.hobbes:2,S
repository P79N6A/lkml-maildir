Hi Fabrizio and Andrey,
About that function in serial.c, serial_pci_guess_board() ...

I have dug deeper and found that the "port type guessing" functionality 
was broken when the driver was ported to the newer PCI interfaces. As 
it is, the probe function in serial.c (serial_init_one()) is *never* 
called for devices that do not already match an entry in the PCI id 
table (serial_pci_tbl[]). The probe function is coded as if non-matching 
devices would cause the probe to be called with a default table index of 
zero (pbn_default). This does not happen, because pci_announce_device() 
bypasses the probe call (pci.c:577) when the driver provides an id table 
and pci_match_device() cannot find a match in the id table. (pci.c:574)
There is not much point in trying to guess the type of a port that has 
already been identified. Devices that are not already in the table do 
not cause the probe and guess functions to be called. 
An older serial.c (rev 5.02 2000-08-09) checks each device against the 
PCI id table and only attempts a guess if there were no matches. 
At the very least, we could just rip out the guess function and not 
change the requirement of already being in the table. Or an attempt 
could be made to fix it to guess on devices that do not match the id 
table, as it used to work. This would move the id scan back to serial.c
from the PCI subsystem.
Your opinions please. How should this be fixed? Is there a "right" way?
