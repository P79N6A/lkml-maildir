I suppose all PHYs do that. Even if they don't, though, I should be
safe as long as I de-isolate unconditionally (instead of testing for
phy_id==0).

Stands to reason. A PHY that can't get out of isolation wouldn't be
very useful.

Makes sense. The Rhine is actually pretty neat in that regard, I've
been able to drop the PHY scanning entirely.
