A better solution would be if it could be determined what your problem 
is.
Could you try 2.6.16-rc4?
If the problem is still present, please open a bug report at the kernel 
Bugzilla [1] with an explanation of your problem, your .config with 
2.6.16-rc4 and the output of "dmesg -s 1000000" in both 2.6.8.1 and 
2.6.16-rc4.
We should fix regressions like yours, but this requires bug reports 
notifying us about problems.
