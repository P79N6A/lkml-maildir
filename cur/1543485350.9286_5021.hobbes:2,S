Hi, is anyone working on improved kernel support for the cs4237b sound
chip? If not, then is there anyone interested in working on improved
kernel support for the cs4237b?
Currently support is available in the form of the cs4232 module, but this
support seems to be, shall we say, lacking a bit.
(What looks like full documentation for the cs4237b is available in pdf
format if anyone is interested)
