Here are some results from running a simple program (source below) that does
10 iterations of creating and then destroying 1000 threads. On the side, another utility
kept reading the pid (+tgid if present) stats from exiting tasks.
	Yes	No	Ovhd
user	0.14	0.15	-6%
system	1.61	1.54	+5%
elapsed	2.01	1.94	+3%
Yes = tgid stats printed on exit
No = not printed
Ovhd = (Yes-No)/No * 100
So even in this extreme case where the per-tgid stats are indeed
half of the total data, the overhead is not very significant.
As pointed out earlier, more representative cases are
- single threaded apps (e.g. make -jX) where the current
taskstats interface already optimizes by not sending redundant per-tgid stats, or
- server-type multithreaded apps where the exits are going to be relatively infrequent (due to
reuse of thread pools) so the extra per-tgid output is not going to have much impact.
I'd suggest we drop the idea of including this patch until we have data showing that
the overhead is an issue.
