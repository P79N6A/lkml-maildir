Hi, i've got some problems with 2.1:
First, i needed to interrupt the build (Ctrl-C), did that,
and once i let it really run freely, got this:
$ time nice -4 make -f Makefile-2.5 CC=/usr/bin/gcc
Using ARCH='i386' AS='as' LD='ld' CC='/usr/bin/gcc' CPP='/usr/bin/gcc -E'
 AR='ar' HOSTAS='as' HOSTLD='gcc' HOSTCC='gcc' HOSTAR='ar'
Generating global Makefile
  phase 1 (find all inputs)
pp_makefile1: .tmp_db_main was not shut down correctly, forcing complete rebuild
pp_makefile1: .../v2.5-1/scripts/pp_db.c:158: alloc_db_chunk: Assertion `__tv.dptr' failed.
make: *** [phase1] Error 134
trying to make clean didn't help, btw. I removed .tmp* and did make
oldconfig (suggested by kbuild), which helped.
Next, i needed to comment out line about dc2xx.o in
drivers/usb/image/Makefile.in (it doesn't has source anymore) to make it
compile.
And the last:
.../v2.5-1/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:223: unterminated character constant
.../v2.5-1/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:264: unterminated character constant
.../v2.5-1/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:280: unterminated character constant
That was Linus's bk tree (cset 1.562)
+ kbuild-2.5-core-4
+ kbuild-2.5-common-2.5.8-pre3-1
+ kbuild-2.5-i386-2.5.8-pre3-1
P.S. "phase 1" for xconfig is evil, is it absolutely unavoidable?
