I wonder if it is possible to avoid the atomic_dec_and_test() here, at
least in the common case, and combine it with the atomic_dec_and_test()
of the dentry.  A quick look at fs/inode.c indicates that inode->i_count
may never get changed for a SINGLE inode, except during creation or
deletion.
It might be worth to
- remove the conditional from iput_single() and measure that it makes a
  difference,
- poison SINGLE inodes with some value and
- put a BUG_ON() in __iget() that checks for the poison value.
I _think_ the BUG_ON() is unnecessary, but at least my brain is not
sufficient to convince me.  Can inotify somehow get a hold of a socket?
Or dquot (how insane would that be?)
