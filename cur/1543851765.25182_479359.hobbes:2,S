Ok, thanks for comments. Here it comes, please (n)ack it:
--
kconfig, correct traffic shaper
As Patrick McHardy <kaber@trash.net> suggested, Traffic Shaper is
now obsolete and alternative to it is no longer CBQ, since its problems with
virtual devices, alter Kconfig text to reflect this -- put a link to the
traffic schedulers as a whole.
