I may be wrong, but to the best of my knowledge that's not possible.
I tried for a while to get it to do that exactely so I could tell
people using it how to do it, but I gave up.
I'd say the best solution is to use a different MUA.  'pine', 'mutt',
'kmail' or even just plain 'mail' from a commandline works well.
