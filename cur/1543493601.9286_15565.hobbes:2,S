Right.  That's the entire point: automatic inheritence of all caps is a
potential security problem, as it lets privileges leak into programs
which weren't designed to cope with those privs.  You _can't_ change
that while maintaining compatibility.  It's a simple one way choice:
compatibility necessarily implies preserving an entire class of security
vulnerabilities.
