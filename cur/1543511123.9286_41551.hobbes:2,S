I see the same on my Alpha AXPpci33:
Serial driver version 4.30 with MANY_PORTS MULTIPORT SHARE_IRQ SERIAL_PCI PCI_IOMEM enabled
Although I remember that my agetty managed to let me log in on ttyS0 after
the boot-process finished.
Interestingly setserial segfaults on any of my serial ports with 2.3.18(+acX).
With 2.3.10 it's ok.

homemade distribution, AXPpci33, obviously UP :-), gcc 2.95, glibc 2.1.1,
14 serial ports.
