I once made the mistake of putting a "please tell andrewm@uow.edu.au" printk
in 3c59x.c.  My inbox nearly died.  Then there's that damned "PCI bus hidden
behind transparent bus" printk which I've actually removed from -mm because
so many people keep reporting it and we don't do anything about it.
All it takes is a couple of people to report the problem to the maintainer
over a few-weeks period.  It doesn't seem unreasonable to expect this to
happen.
