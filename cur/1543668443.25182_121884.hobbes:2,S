Hi.
Has anyone seen this happen?
I'm getting TX packets as errors, looks like some swapped register in 
the chip maybe?
And yes, they are actually TXed correct, and i've also tried swapping 
the NIC with another one from the same brand/model, and also into 
another machine with the same results.
The chip is physically branded as an "ADMtek AN983B", the board is an 
"Xnet 3000ACM".
PCI manufacturer ID looks quite phony, this is no Linksys board.
Kernel is 2.4.20.
Any ideas?
