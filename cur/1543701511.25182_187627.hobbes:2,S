Correct.  Even what is now downloadable as:
  
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-3.3
seems to have this fixed, and has a gcc/cp/NEWS file entry stating:
     + -Wall no longer implies -W.  The new warning flag, -Wsign-compare,
        included in -Wall, warns about dangerous comparisons of signed and
        unsigned values. Only the flag is new; it was previously part of
        -W.
