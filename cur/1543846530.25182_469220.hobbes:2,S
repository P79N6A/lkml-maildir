In general RHEL3 isn't to good at returning from "memory shortage"
once the oom comes out I would consider the system trashed. You need
to manage it better so you don't overcommit the system resouces.

If you are using too much memory you are using too much memory.  RHEL3
may not be recovering well (by your standards) from this. (perhaps not
any kernel for that matter)

Choosing who to kill is a hard decision.  Stay away from the kernel
oom killer is is a wiley beast.

There are a whole bunch of /proc knobs (more than just the overcommit)
in RHEL3 that you may dive into.  You would need to get your RHEL
support to help you out with that.  It is really hard to say what the
deal is but if you application is using too much memory oom is
inevitable.
  As far as having an oom killer that meets you standards... You have
to talk to Redhat about that.
  At a high level I would say add more memory (or reduce the amount
used my the applications) to the box if you can't find the right /proc
bit to work.  Sounds like something has to give.
good luck,
  Keith
