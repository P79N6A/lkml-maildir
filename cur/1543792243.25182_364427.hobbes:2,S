Hi Lee,
   It very well could be a video issue causing my xruns. That's been
the biggest, but not olny,  factor, but I don't know any more. I've
gone down so many paths that haven't yielded results.
   I've tried the NoAccel and RenderAccel experiments you suggested.
You also mentioned not loading DRI which I guess isn't possible anyway
with a PCI-Express card. Anyway, I don't have it loaded.
   While I do get xruns, they are happening lately only a couple of
times a day, and usually very late in the day after the machine has
been running for 12+ hours. If I pull Jack back to 256/2 then I don't
think I get them at all so I'm living with it for now and hoping for a
solution one of these days. Low latency really only matters to me when
recording which is <5% of the time.
   I'm most interested in a kernel developer finding the time to fix
the IRQoff latency testing on 64-bit machines so I can look at that.
   In case the question comes to mind for others, this HDSP 9652 sound
card runs for months at a time at 64/2 in my older Via 32-bit machine.
The problem only surfaced when I moved it to my new AMD64 machine.
   Anyway, that's status. It's a frustration, not a killer issue.
Cheers,
Mark
