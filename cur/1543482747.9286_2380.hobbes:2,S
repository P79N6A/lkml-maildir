Not for me.  That's probably just the advantage of having swap on a
separate disk, but I've got both a "find /" and a "wc /usr/bin/*"
running right now, and interactive performance is not noticeably
degraded on 2.2.0-release with 64MB (and that is with two active users
on the box right now).  Concurrent filesystem and swap IO on the same
spindle is always going to suck.
