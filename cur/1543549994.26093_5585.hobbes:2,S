This has happened three times now, when dd'ing a boot image to a floppy.
The screen goes blank, Alt+SysRq don't seem to have any effect.
System:
Athlon 800
KA7-100
RedHat 7.0
The first time there was a data CRC error listed in /var/log/messages,
so I tried with a different floppy, but the same thing happened, this
time with no syslog output.
