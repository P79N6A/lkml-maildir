You know, CDA is dead and gone, but I really doubt that putting this
pile as-is in any vicinity of this account would be a good idea.
Besides, half of them will need a translation - I doubt that 80Kb of
grep output intermixed with comments in English and Russian, some of
them printable, would be useful. Fasicanting - maybe, but... IOW, turning
that into documentation will take some efforts.
