Subject: 2.6.22-rc3-mm1: Xen compile error with X86_CMPXCHG=n

I'm getting the following compile error in 2.6.22-rc3-mm1 with 
CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG=n (with -Werror-implicit-function-declaration - 
otherwise it would be a link error):
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      drivers/xen/grant-table.o
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/linux-2.6.22-rc3-mm1/drivers/xen/grant-table.c: In function ‘gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref’:
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/linux-2.6.22-rc3-mm1/drivers/xen/grant-table.c:203: error: implicit declaration of function ‘sync_cmpxchg’
make[3]: *** [drivers/xen/grant-table.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
Adding a dependency of XEN on X86_CMPXCHG should not be a problem and 
not prevent any reasonable real-life usage.
But what worries me is that a seemingly architecture independent 
driver uses a function only available in some configurations.
