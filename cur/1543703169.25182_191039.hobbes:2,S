Subject: [Newbie-warning] MOD_INC_USE_COUNT usage

With the high risk of being flamed, I send this to LKML. Feel free
to tell me not to if this is a huge no-no, and it won't happen
again.
I was studying some of the warnings that appears when compiling
2.6.1-mm3, and one common warning is the MOD_INC_USE_COUNT macro
being used. Apparently it's deprecated, but if that's the case,
why is it still being used in the kernel?
I googled a bit and found a few discussions about the issue
(mostly concerning the /mm-subsystem) where some people found
it okay to just remove the call to MOD_INC_USE_COUNT totally,
since it is totally unnecessary under 2.5 (and under 2.6 too,
I presume). Since the discussions provided a lot of contradictions
and no solution, I thought asking a question to someone who has
an idea of what this is about might be a good thing.
I'm not asking you to remove this call, but I do want to know
why it shouldn't be removed and what is being done to replace
a function (or macro... whatever it is) that is deprecated. Any
explanations would be gratefully accepted. Thank you.
Since I'm no kernel-hacker (and not much of a coder at all)
don't expect me to understand a lot of jargon, but this question
is being asked because I'm really interested in understanding
the Linux kernel.
So, why shouldn't this patch be applied?:
