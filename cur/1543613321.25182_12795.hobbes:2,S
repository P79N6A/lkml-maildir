Generally, ROM based stuff is compressed before being written to
NVRAM. It's uncompressed into a RAM-Disk and the RAM-Disk is mounted.
That way, you can use, say, 2 megabytes of NVRAM to get a 10 to 20
megabyte root file-system. This also allows /tmp and /var/log to be
writable, which is a great help because the development environment 
closely approximates the run-time environment.
FYI, generally NVRAM access is sooooo slow. I don't think you'd
like to use it directly as a file-system and access-time will be
a problem unless you modify the kernel.
