Hilarious problem:
I just installed a fresh slackware 7.0 installation with al
new goodies'n'stuff.
System: asus P2L97-DS board, 2x P-II 300MHz, 7880 on-board
scsi, 64MB ram (1 slice of ram).
kernel v2.2.13
I have a diamond s220 videocard (PCI - my matrox millenium
suddenly only gave black visuals ;-]) installed and had it always
working in 800x600 x256 colors. Since I was installing my
system freshly anyway, I thought 'what the heck, let's make
that like 16 bit color'. That was without the mtrr-configuration
-option. When I used that and scrolled fast trough documents in
netscape, the machine would lock-up almost instantly (<1 sec).
When using the mtrr-fix, it takes a little but only a very little,
longer to have it crash solidly by doing the fast moves. I've
had these problems before and fixed them by reducing the number of
colors to 256. That'll fix the problem now again, but still I wonder
what's causing this problem. Haven't had this problem in windows nt
(yes, that one supports multiproc.), nor in windows 95/98. Also ran
the memory-test program for about 8 hours. Also, I'm always running
2x setiathome-clients (without them, things also crash - I did *not*
ran them when doing that mem-test, by the way).
