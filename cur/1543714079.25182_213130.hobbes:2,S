so you say with my first patch both USB ports are working then? so clie sync only
works on one of the ports but the mouse on both?

ok, it's the interrupt routing, not the chip config. i think the first patch that
adds the tm361 to the dmi_scan problem table is correct then. real good

it works with windows because it assigned all the devices to the same irq
i'll submit it later to andrew morton.
