There is no way to leave a radiolist &c just leaving whatever was set
alone. An <Exit> option would be nice.
To give help on menuconfig at an entry that leads to a menu ("blabla --->")
is confusing at best. Add a "<Help on menucofig> button instead?
The help on menuconfig gives Michael Elizabeth Chastain as maintainer. I
believe that is not true...
Thanks much for the good work!
