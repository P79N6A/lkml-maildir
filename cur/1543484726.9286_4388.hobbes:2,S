	Hello All,  Try that with raid0145-19990128-2.2.0.gz patch
	and have 5 or so disks in the array . ;-)  (Not to even mention
	SMP & the apic stuff too ...)
	Not enough memory area set aside to hold all that data .
	Given the above patches & 2.2.[01+] , By the time the filesystems
	are mounted the memory area set aside for holding the dmesg data
	has already rolled , Thus it is lost .
	Where in the kernel is the SIZE set for the area used by dmesg ?
	Ah-Heck .  I'll just go look .  I am going to attempt to increase
	this area & see what sort of problems I run into ,  I'll also
	increase the area searched by dmesg .
	If anyone knows of any porblems doing this please say so ?
