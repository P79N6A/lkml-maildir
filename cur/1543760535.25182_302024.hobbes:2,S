The real issue here is that under heavy I/O activity (bonnie is a good way to 
emphasize the concept), even caused by only one task, the system becomes 
quite unresponsive and "sluggish". The same can be seen under a gentoo 
"emerge --metadata", and slocate has the same effect.
The problem is not only related to desktop, but i.e. on a dual opteron il 
takes several seconds to have an "ls" output (on a nearly empty dir) or 
simply to log in using ssh.
It seems to me that I/O scheduler gives high priority to the running process 
and any other request is delayed to the point that the responsiveness of a 
desktop becomes poor (say, to open a "K" menu takes several seconds on a pIV 
2.8G HT).
In every case, we seen that the I/O bound processes are stuck in "D" state, 
the same stands for pdflush and kswapd.
