It has been > 1 month since this last e-mail, I was wondering if anyone in 
the community [or Intel] could provide an update?  I spoke with one of the 
lmsensors the other day and he stated that there may be a plan to 
incorporate the CPU temperature soon, depending on what Intel does/what 
they provide.
Are we any closer to getting full HECI support in the kernel today than 
last month?
Justin.
