"Are"??
I see several good people spout this particular type of nonsense
here. If I interpret "are" to mean that that is the unit
disk manufacturers use, then it is false - as far as I know
no manufacturer uses this.
Let us look at Maxtor. They are so friendly to give disk size
as part of the type.
Maxtor 91728D8 - 17280442368 bytes, 17280 MB, 17.2 GB
Maxtor 93652U8 - 36529274880 bytes, 36529 MB, 36.5 GB
Maxtor 96147H6 - 61473226752 bytes, 61473 MB, 61.4 GB
You see that the number of GB claimed by the manufacturer is
just (number of megabytes)/1000.
There is no 2.4% difference that could justify your strange claim.
All disk manufacturers always use decimal.
And this has been true for many years.
