I've updated the patchset I've put together.
- -ck9 contains:
O(1) Scheduler (with batch scheduling)
Preemptible
Low Latency
Compressed Caching
XFS
Supermount
ALSA
The choice of patches to add was based on requests and feedback. The -aa and 
- -rmap vms are not compatible with this release; but the performance of -ck9 
outperforms both of them.  XFS compiles without problems but is untested.

Cheers, enjoy!
Con.
