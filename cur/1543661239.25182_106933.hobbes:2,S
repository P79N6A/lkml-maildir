The problem is we can't detect AMD76x IDE and thus the prefetch into
I/O space bug until we've done memory setup. What probably should occur
is we grab the 636-640K page if it would otherwise be free, and then
free it after pci quirk handling.
Another approach would be to write a replacement ide_build_sglist for
the AMD76x which bounces the problem page.
