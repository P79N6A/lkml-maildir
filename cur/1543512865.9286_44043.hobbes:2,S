The described kernel will notify devd to create the nodes when they show
up, i.e., on boot or when the device is plugged in. Any dynamic /dev will
have to include this exact functionality somehow, plus a chunk of devd and
the space for /dev in the kernel. And then you need special provisions to
handle persistence. Modules have nothing at all to do with this. The bloat
argument is exactly the other way around.
