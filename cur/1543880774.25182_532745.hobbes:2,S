Descriptions of that are probably where I got the idea (hurrah for OS
textbooks). It makes a fair amount of sense. Not sure what the take on
the specific precedent is. The only content here is expanding the
priority range with ranges above and below for the exclusive use of
ultra-privileged tasks, so it's really trivial. Actually it might be so
trivial it should just be some permission checks in the SCHED_OTHER
renicing code.
