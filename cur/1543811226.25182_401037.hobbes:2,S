This is Toshiba Portege 4000, BIOS 2.10 dated 15 Dec 2003. I'll try to find 
how to submit a bug report but I do not hold my breath.

More simple solution may be the patch below. I am not sure if INT13 succeeded 
is always the same as status == 0; there appears to be at least one corner 
case 11h == "data ECC corrected". 
The patch fixed the issue here.

Subject: [PATCH] Fix EDD to properly ignore signature of non-existing drives
From: Andrey Borzenkov <arvidjaar@mail.ru>
Some BIOSes do not always set CF on error before return from int13.
The patch adds additional check for status being zero (AH == 0).
