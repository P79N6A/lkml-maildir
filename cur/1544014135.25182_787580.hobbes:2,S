drivers/built-in.o: In function `lpddr_probe':
(.text+0x95ddc): undefined reference to `lpddr_cmdset'
with
# CONFIG_MTD_LPDDR is not set
CONFIG_MTD_QINFO_PROBE=y
There appears to be too little control/coordination between those
two kconfig symbols.  Surely one of them (MTD_QINFO_PROBE) should
depend on the other (MTD_LPDDR).  And why even build 2 modules
when MTD_QINFO_PROBE is enabled?  Why not combine the code into
one module?
