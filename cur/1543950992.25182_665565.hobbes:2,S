Sure. the largest address space that can be used on a 32bit platform
with 4k pages is 16TB (2^32 * 2^12 = 2^44 = 16TB). For XFS, that
means metadata can't be placed higher in the filesystem than 16TB,
and seeing as we only have a single address space for metadata, the
filesystem is limited to 16TB. It could be fixed with software
changes, but really there's no excuse for using x86 given how
cheap x86_64 is now.....

Yes, switching to 64 bit machines will fix this problem as the
address space will now hold 2^64*2^12 bytes.....
Cheers,
Dave.
