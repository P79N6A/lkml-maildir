See my other post on this subject.  The driver knows that a read is
required to ensure that a write is posted, but assumes that 8bit
transactions are forwarded as such, writes are issued in the order
retired (we use a memory barrier to avoid the compiler using a
different order), and that reads cannot pass posted writes.
