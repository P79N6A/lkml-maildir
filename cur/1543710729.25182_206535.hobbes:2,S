Then it becomes an identity mapping (as in 1:1) and is therefore
not usefull.
If you are doing double mapping, then I (as a server administrator)
would not export the filesystem to you.
The current situation is always a 1:1 mapping (NFS version < 4). Therefore
any filesystem export is by definition within the same security domain.
If you as an administrator of a client host violate the UIDs assigned to
you (by hiding the audit trail), then you are violating the rules established
in that security domain; and should not be trusted - and the client host
should not have an available export.
It is never necessary to map on a client. It means that the server has been
improperly setup, or that the client is not within the proper security domain.
