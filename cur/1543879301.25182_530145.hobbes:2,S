Yes, but currently those users are more or less hidden and working
independently.

The potential for users is the bare minimum expected, next step is that
there are any and them agreeing on common implementations.

Very good points there, you're right.

I prefer clear, simple code that is easily audited to be correct or at least
not cause problems, which is small enough to not add much bloat. I don't care
about "very slow" or merely "slow" code. RSA/DSA isn't used as a symmetric block
cipher, where it does make sense to optimize it to death.
From the kernel's point of view it's all new and unused code, so it should be
judged by its quality, not by its heritage.
I know you didn't want to talk about the user versus kernel space question,
but I think it's a very important and interesting one. As you said, GPG is
there around for years and tested, why making a new implementation in the kernel?
Your argument holds for the whole as much as for parts of the infrastructure.

And whether they can agree on a common implementation. If they all just want to do
their own thing, and not combine resources, then it doesn't make any sense to merge
anything at all, as it would be ignored anyway.
As for the userspace issue, I get the impression that they didn't consider it very
well, ignoring things like initramfs versus main filesystem and so on. It's also a
gradual thing, some things can be done best in the kernel, and others in user space.
Another alternative is to push it up into the boot loader. ;-)
