Yes, I don't know exactly when it was changed, but jiffies is now
updated when we return from suspend, which causes the uptime to
effectively increase while we are suspended.

Well, anyone can hack their kernel to say whatever uptime they want, so
I'm not to worried about cheating. Are you seeing an actual bug here?

Why exactly do you want this behavior? Maybe a better explanation would
help stir this discussion.
The question about the correct behavior is more relevant with
virtualization as well. Should the OS's uptime increase even when
another OS is running on the cpu? What is the proper interface to export
the OS's cpu time? 
Right now I'm of the opinion that jiffies should be updated, as real
time has past and timer events that are queued should expire. 
However with a good enough reason, we might want to add another counter
that keeps track of how much time we've been suspended as well. 
thanks
