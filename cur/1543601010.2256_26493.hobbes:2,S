Almost agreed, but there may be a long interval between when that reference
was observed in the page table, and when read_swap_cache_async upon it is
actually performed (waiting for BKL, waiting to allocate pages for prior
swapin_readahead).  In that interval the reference can be removed:
certainly by swapoff, certainly by vm_swap_full removal, anything else?
That's why the pte_same tests were added into do_swap_page in 2.4.8.
