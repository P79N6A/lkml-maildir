Right - so fake-numa is not the right solution for everyone, and I
never suggested that it is. (Having said that, there are discussions
underway to make the zone-based approach more practical - if you could
have dynamically-resizable nodes, this would be more applicable to
openvz).
But, there's no reason that the OpenVZ resource control mechanisms
couldn't be hooked into a generic process container mechanism along
with cpusets and RG.
