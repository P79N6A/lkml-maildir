That wasn't supposed of IDE in the war against SCSI either, but look
where we're now. :-)
The one argument that noone brought around here is (and it is the
killer argument for me in IDE vs. SCSI): "external disk trays". Try
that with IDE (current IDE please. No SerialATA. ;-) ) without lots of
"out of spec" cables dangling out of your "enterprise computing
solution".
If you need more than say, three or four disks, your solution is
SCSI. Or FibreChannel.
