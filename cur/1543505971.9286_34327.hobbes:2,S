Title says it.  Several modules complain about these missing:
__down_failed
__up_wakeup
I notice that they've been removed from alpha_ksyms, but what's intended
to replace them (if anything)?
Also, this needs to be commented out of alpha_ksyms.c:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(_memset_io);
It doesn't seem to be either defined or used anymore.
