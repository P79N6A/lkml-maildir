so you have the source code --if its such a big deal for you, how about you 
contribute the work to make this possible ?
the fact is, large-packet-per-second generation fits into two categories:
  (a) script kiddies / haxors who are interested in building DoS tools
  (b) folks that spend too much time benchmarking.
for the (b) case, typically the PPS-generation is only part of it.  getting 
meaningful statistics on reordering (if any) as well as accurate latency 
and ideally real-world traffic flows is important.  there are specialized 
tools out there to do this: Spirent, Ixia, Agilent et al make them.

10GbE NICs are an entirely different beast from 1GbE.
as you pointed out, with real-world packet sizes today, one can sustain 
wire-rate 1GbE today (same holds true for 2Gbps Fibre Channel also).
i wouldn't call pushing minimum-packet-size @ 1GbE (which is 46 payload, 72 
bytes on the wire btw) "real world".  and its 1.488M packets/second.

its fine when you have meaningful interrupt coalescing going on & large 
packets to DMA.
it fails when you have inefficient DMA (small) with the overhead of setting 
up & tearing down the DMA and associated arbitration overhead.
cheers,
