I'll second that, the priority inversion issues I was having with 
2.6.0-test3-mm2 are completely gone!  I haven't been able to get any 
serious inversion issues to bring the system to its knees yet, but I'll 
keep trying.  The only difference is that I've disabled sound in order 
to use the latest kernels, but I don't think that probably had anything 
to do with the inversion problems I was running into.
And after using 2.6.0-test4 vanilla for a few hours I have a new 
appreciation for the improvements that come with Con's patches...
