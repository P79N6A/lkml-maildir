A dictionnary should be enough. I understand that they must be considered
as strictly ordered even on target where some have same representation. 
In other words:
- Never assume that 2 of them have the same representation if you want to 
  write portable C code.
- A nice compiler will warn you when your code seems to assume such thing,
  even if the target platform has actually same representation for the 2
  types.

Apply these sentences to army, and if it still isn't clear, then 
learn French language. ;-)

I donnot remember 'int' to ever have been 16 bits large on real 
machines. Is this spec. that old? ;-)

Example on GCOS8:
char      9 bits
short    36 bits     (optionnally 18 bits)
int      36 bits
long     36 bits 
Seems both Bill and Bull are still compliant to C, btw. :-)
