Yes, LTTng supersedes LTT. It provides the ability to extract traces
across execution layers (hypervisor, kernel, userspace) to perform
performance analysis and debugging of applications at the system level.
LTTng's approach differs from LTT in that it allows completely
customizable instrumentation. We chose to provide that based on the
previous LTT experience, where we have seen that adding instrumentation
is very often required when digging deeply into a problem.
