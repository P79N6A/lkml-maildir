1 or 2 MB is a nice number.
Seek time (plus rotational latency) on disks still takes
on the order of 10 ms, while disks commonly transfer data
on the order of 50MB/second.
That means one disk seek (10ms) takes as long as it takes
to read around 512kB of data.
The current 128kB means that if you have lots of streaming
IO going on, you spend only 20% of the time transferring
data and get roughly 10MB/s.  Seek 10ms, read 2.5ms worth
of data.
OTOH, if you do 2MB per request for the same heavy streaming
workload (say, an ftp or nfs server doing media files), you
can get 80% of the disk throughput, or 40MB/s.  This is because
you spend 40ms transferring data for every 10ms seek time.
Yes, filesystem metadata will reduce this "occasionally",
but the general idea holds.
