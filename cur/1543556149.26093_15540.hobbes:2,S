Yes, I was on the plane when I read your report, but I can't reproduce
this.  I use masquerading every day (my laptop lives in its own
masqueraded subnet), currently test10:
Linux penicillin 2.4.0-test10 #1 SMP Fri Nov 10 12:31:21 EST 2000 i686 unknown

I've no other reports, and people are using this in production.
That's why it was so puzzling...
