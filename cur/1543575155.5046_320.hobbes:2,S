Yes, if(bh->b_next == NULL && !destroy_dirty_buffers) seems to work, too.
I wonder why, because, if I analysed the problem correctly, it was caused
by the page mapping. Or is it a general rule that bh->b_next==NULL if
bh->b_page->mapping != NULL, ie. a buffer is never directly hased and belongs
to a mapped page?
Is there a place one can look for documentation about these things?
Another question is what should happen with the mapped pages? Whoever calls
invalidate_buffers(), probably does it because the underlying device disappered
or changed, so the page mappings should be invalidated, too.
OTOH, pages are (normally) mapped through inodes, and if the inode stays valid
after the invalidate_buffers() (ie. if it's called by an lvm resize event),
the page mapping stays valid, too.
