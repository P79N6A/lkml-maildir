The implementation follows the MMC driver model (there exist MSIO cards, but none are supported at the moment). The MS Pro support appears stable from what I can learn from user reports. Nevertheless, I've implemented a couple of diagnostics files in the "sys" filesystem, as well as low level format facility for legacy MS cards.

Or drivers/memstick/.  Will anything else need this header?
