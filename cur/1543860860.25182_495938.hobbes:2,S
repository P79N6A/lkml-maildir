Anohter approach would be to use a separate output directory.
In this way you have all generated files in a separate place which
should solve your needs.
To use it do like this:
make mrproper <= To get a clean starting point
mkdir ../o
make O=../o defconfig   <= or some other config target
cd ../o
make
Se also README.
