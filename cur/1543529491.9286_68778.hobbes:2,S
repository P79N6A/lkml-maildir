I realised that, however what I am trying to point out is that originally
the driver could supply a "no kernel argument default fontname".  This seems
to be no longer possible, so to get the font you want to be default, you
have to specifically deny the user from selecting the other fonts by
compiling them out of the kernel.
This seems to be a step backwards to me.  Could it be arranged that:
1. If the user specified a font, and the font exists, use this.
2. If fb_info.fontname is present, and the font exists, use this.
3. Use the first font available.
