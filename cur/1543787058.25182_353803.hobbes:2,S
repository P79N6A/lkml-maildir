Ehh.. pid's don't get re-used until they wrap.
Your _current_ code has that problem, though - "struct task_struct" _does_ 
get re-used.
Don't assume that the fixes are as bad.
Anyway, Christoph is certainly correct that what you _should_ be using is 
the SIGIO infrastructure, even if you don't actually use the fcntl() to 
register it.

I don't think so. 
Your oops is because you're using a STALE POINTER.
If you look it up by pid, it won't be stale, now will it?
Hint: the point where sighand is released is also the point where the 
process is unhashed.
