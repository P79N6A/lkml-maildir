The tcp_v6_rcv() code path is holding the slock on the parent
listening socket, whereas in sk_clone() we have grabbed the
socket slock on the newly allocated "newsk" socket.  These
are thus two seperate locks, although they are in the same
locking class "slock-AF_INET6".
I don't know why the lock validator is complaining about this.
