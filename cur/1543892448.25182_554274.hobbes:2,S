I don't think the patch is suitable for merging at this time. Perhaps
if it survives some time in -mm* / 2.6.23* it could be backported
in a later 2.6.22 stable release. But right now it definitely
needs more testing and addressing of my review comments.

All such headers are only for the trail of blame and do you want to blame
Justin if anything goes wrong? Perhaps it should rather have a 
Blame-to: <whoever wrote Justin/Jesse's BIOS> but that also wouldn't 
help without concrete contact points.
