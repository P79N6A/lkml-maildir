Please ensure that the machine was booted with `profile=1' on
the kernel boot command line.  The cost of this is negligible.
When the problem starts happening, run:
sudo readprofile -r
sleep 10
sudo readprofile -n -v -m /boot/System.map | sort -n +2 | tail -40
(make sure that /boot/System.map refers to the currently-running kernel)
