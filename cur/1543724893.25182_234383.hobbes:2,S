In both old and new you are passing in hdc=ide-scsi on the boot line, telling 
the kernel to use ide-scsi  for hdc. (I'd guess that /dev/cdrom points 
to /dev/sr0). The bit below shows that it has correctly inserted the ide-scsi 
module in your old kernel and detected the cdrom. That is missing from the 
new one. Are you sure you built the ide-scsi module in your new kernel? Have 
you checked /var/log/messages or /var/log/warn to see if there were any 
errors about problems with the ide-scsi module?
Fairly certain I remember getting the same error one time when I forgot to 
build ide-scsi.

Edward
