Hey, that seems to be a nice example of how to write
a new netlink family.  Thanks!
I see you're using NETLINK_USERSOCK.  Netlink families
appear to be a precious commodity (netlink_dev.c, at
least, will break if you raise MAX_LINKS above 32).
Has there been any discussion of how one should pick
netlink family numbers for new stuff like netkeeper?
Sure, everyone could use NETLINK_USERSOCK, but
that means only one new netlink module could be resident at a time...
