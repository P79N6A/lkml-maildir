Just wanted to jump in -- I have the same problem with 2.4.21-pre4-ac4. 
 I've got 2  PDC20268's running 4 WD 200GB drives.
Powersupply is a 550 watt  Antec.
I have a seperate 13gb drive that I'm booting from on the motherboard, 
so the system doesn't lock and reboots bring everything back fine.
I the bios on my PDC's is 2..20.0.14, tried with different cables (same 
problem).  The drives do seem to come back -- acts as if it has a hard 
time resetting the drives but finally comes back (after about 5-10 minutes).
