Damn straight.  But I never intended this to happen; this patch was one
of a series.
I went through and fixed up many of them but naturally such a patch was
fragile, huge, and even broke some stuff.
As a result, Andrew dropped the patch, which is fair, but leaves us with
the current state.
I'll go through those patches again today and resent against -mm.
Rusty.
