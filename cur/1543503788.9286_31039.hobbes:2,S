Original problem: when it returned to non-lazy mode it failed to reload
cr3 and had a fair chance to kfree the PGD under itself (if it was unlucky
enough to get that timeslice from the exiting process). With obvious 
results. That was fixed in -pre1. And there still *is* something odd.
	BTW, for x86 gurus: what will happen if in ring 0 you change %cr3
(register, that is), leave the value in TSS unmodified and then return to
ring 3? Is there any chance that processor will reload the old value
(undefined/some processors are buggy and know to do that/it's documented
behaviour/never happens on known processors)?
