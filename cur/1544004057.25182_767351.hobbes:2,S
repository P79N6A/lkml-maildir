MPX is about making use of multiple input devices simultaneously and most of
the groundwork to get MT devices going is already there. From X's point of
view we need a bunch of new events to be sent to clients (and the bells and
whistles around it). The hard bit here is deciding which client to send the
events to.
I'd also say that an MT device should be presented as a single device with
multiple input points rather than as multiple separate devices.
This does require to rewrite applications (or at least slot some intermediate
layer in between), but having multitouch look like multi-mouse is a really bad
idea.
