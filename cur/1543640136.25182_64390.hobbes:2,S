Subject: [PATCH] Include tgid when finding next_safe in get_pid()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This was broken out from the original get_pid() patch, but it is
aplicable even if the other isn't taken. Please apply.
Thanks,
