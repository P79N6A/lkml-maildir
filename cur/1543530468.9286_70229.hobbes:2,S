Yes. You can avoid this by simply touching the memory when it is
allocated. You could, for example, allocate a small "emergency" buffer at
initialisation, touch it (so you know it is there and safe to use), then
(on receipt of a SIGTERM) exit gracefully, using this space for any
buffers etc. needed.
It's not just an OOM situation that could cause your process to be killed
this way; a routine shutdown will SIGTERM you, for example, as would (I
think) an imminent power failure signal from a UPS? In all these cases,
you want to exit as cleanly and quickly as possible, without any lost
data.
