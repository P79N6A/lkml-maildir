It does appear to completely hang in the free loop.  Something funny is
happening there.  I'll try to provide more details later.  BTW, do you
mind updating your patches for 2.5.59?  I'm having some other problems
and I want to make sure it isn't my bad merging that's at fault :)

Actually, I think that using lowmem is OK.  The machine is going away
soon anyway, and the necessary memory is a very small portion,
especially on a machine with this much RAM.

I think this might be overkill.  ZONE_NORMAL gives you what you want,
and I don't think it's worth it to introduce a new one just for the
relatively short timespan where you have the new kernel loaded, but
haven't actually shut down.  I think a little comment next to the
allocation explaining this will be more than enough.
Martin, any ideas?
