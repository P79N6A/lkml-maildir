Yes, you are right, thanks.

I still think we are ok with no ptrace. If that (non-coredump) signal was
delivered before de_thread sets SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT, then this flag is set
by __group_complete_signal(), so de_thread return -EAGAIN. If de_thread()
wins, the signal will be dequeued later from ->shared_pending.
tkill() is different, but I don't see any problem here.
