If get_user_pages() was called with write=1, get_user_pages() will fault in
a real page and yes, I guess it'll be pte_young.
If get_user_pages() was called with write=0, get_user_pages() will fault
in a mapping of the zero page and we'd never get this far.

We won't try to unmap a page's ptes until that page has file-or-swapcache
backing.
If the pte is then cleared, a subsequent minor fault will reestablish the
mapping to the same physical page.  A major fault cannot happen because the
page was pinned by get_user_pages().
