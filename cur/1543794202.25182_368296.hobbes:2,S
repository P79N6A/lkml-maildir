I gave it a quick test before leaving the house this morning... Here is 
an exerp from an oops I got after closing mplayer, watching an ATSC (dvb 
in USA) stream, using AverTVHD a180 (saa7134 + nxt200x).

More detailed log at:
http://techsounds.org/v4l/2.6.15-rc1-mm2-error.log
The oops spammed the entire log, so if you need to see what I have 
running on my system, here is a working dmesg (only v4l+dvb parts) from 
2.6.14 + hybrid (v4l+dvb) merged cvs, almost equivalent code to what we 
have in the current kernel:
http://techsounds.orgdotorg.org/v4l/dmesg.txt
I understand that you might need some more info.... Email me if you need 
something else... I'll be around for the next 5 hours.... After that, I 
will be away for the weekend, and I can do more tests on Monday 
evening.  This was on an intel p4, 2.53 GHz, 533 FSB, 768 MB ram, using 
Intel D845PEBT2 motherboard.
