Right you are failing other allocations.

Allright maybe you can get the kernel to be stable in the face of having 
no memory and debug all the fallback paths in the kernel when an OOM 
condition occurs.
But system calls will fail? Like fork/exec? etc? There may be daemons 
running that are essential for the system to survive and that cannot 
easily take an OOM condition? Various reclaim paths also need memory and 
if the allocation fails then reclaim cannot continue.
