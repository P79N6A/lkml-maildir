Bleurgh, the latest version of the driver (not in the kernel yet) searches 
for turbo based cards by checking the isa address space from 0xc0000 - 
0xe0000 in 8k chunks. So we'd have to ioremap each 8k section, check it, 
find out the adapter isn't there and then iounmap it. 
Oh well, if that's what it takes =:0
