Thank you for the quick response - normally I would not have bothered
with the kernel list but this is a case where the same source would
sucessfully compile on "git4" but not on "git9 or git10"
As I previously stated the message is also being sent to the VirtualBox
developers (who will likely tell that they don't support those who build
and test development kernels)
Once again thanks
