Right Thanks. I did not realize I was not in text mode.
I have somehow fixed the problem by doing something to the apm-bios
settings. I disabled a bunch of stuff in the bios and the thing is working
apparently ok now. Don't ask me what cause I really don't know. It's just
working now.
Thanks, anyway.
This message should not now be in html format... I hope.
