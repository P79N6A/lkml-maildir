I also had a report from Matt that running the driver full-bore caused
the mouse to go haywire.  I did some testing and the mouse didn't go
haywire, but my keyboard did.  I changed the udelay(1) to schedule() and
kipmi0 is running at 100% as I type right now, and things seem to be
running smoothly.  Testing the performance, I got 4.5ms per message for
a get device id, which was the same as I saw before the change.  So I
think this change is a good idea.
I'll let Peter test it out when he gets his machines back, and if it all
looks good I'll do a patch.
Thanks,
-Corey
