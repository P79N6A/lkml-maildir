That's being worked on.

Wrong.  The Sonic only does DMA to DMA addresses which will be translated
to physical addresses by the IOMMU.  That is it never ever deals with
physical addresses directly.
When transmitting or receiving a buffer it has to be mapped into the
DMA controller's address space first, for example through dma_map_single.
As the result you will obtain a DMA address which you will feed to the
Sonic or put into a rx or tx ring, whatever.  And you need to remember it
in the driver private data, just like the virtual address of the buffer
or the struct sk_buff pointer.  So all you need is to look at your private
data to find that virtual address you need for memcpy.
tg3 is a reasonable example of a driver - albeit not a simple one.

bus_to_virt and virt_to_bus are shooting offences these days, no less.
