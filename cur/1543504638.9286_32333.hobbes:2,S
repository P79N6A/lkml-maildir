I do that automatically nowadays, since they're useless anyway.

I'd be surprised if even those lusers can make sense of it.

The problem with HTML is that it's becoming less and less standard as
Micro$oft keeps tweaking it. I would therefore say that if you wish to
use HTML for documentation, you should ensure that it looks decent
under any reasonable browser - and if the stuff being documented does
not require a graphics interface itself, that the HTML looks decent
when read using lynx !!!
Best wishes from Riley.
