Actually I try to get VirtualBox-1.5.2_OSE to compile but I get a lot errors from 
include/asm-generic/atomic.h and other headers.
and looks like some are missing ?
...
/lib/modules/2.6.23-rc0/build/include/asm/irq_32.h:15:25: error: irq_vectors.h: No such file or directory
/lib/modules/2.6.23-rc0/build/include/asm/smp_32.h:154:26: error: mach_apicdef.h: No such file or directory
...
this is fresh cloned tree and pulled once to get your x86 updates:
#-- git rev-parse --verify HEAD
