This seems to be an ACPI related problem on ALI 1533/1535 
compatible implementations frequently seen on Toshiba's.
As a workaround, Boot with ACPI=off and add --directisa to 
hwclock lines in rc.sysinit and halt (or their equivalents)
If this is really an Intel chipset it would be a first 
Please post your problem, solution and system info and lspci 
to ACPI list.
