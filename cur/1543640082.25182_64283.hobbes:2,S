I'm afraid I'll disappoint you guys but chances of getting this into mainline
are slim for the following reasons:
1.New motherboards have built-in sound, it may be crappy but definitely
  better than PC speaker.
2.PC speaker hardware is not standardized enough. It is designed to beep reliably,
  but no manufacturer tests it for good frequency diagram and such. Since they may
  be wired differently, you can't be sure which way you can force maximum amplitude
  on a particular mobo (there are 2 or 3 ways to reach max on different mobos.
  Or so I read in a magazine a long ago).
3.It loads CPU enormously. Even more so considering that some recent chipsets _emulate_
  speaker via their integrated sound and SMM mode (ick).
These are typical symptoms:

In short: making it work right on wide variety of hardware is next to impossible
and even then results are mediocre (low volume, radio quality).
Of course I understand the desire to make simple hardware do nice and unexpected
things which it even wasn't designed to do.  :-)  Maybe ALSA team have some member
crazy enough to join you.
