Have people run memtest86 over weekend without errors?
I found nForce2 (newer ones, rev2? A7N8X rev 2 and K7N2 Delta) to be
veery picky to DDR400 RAMs. I was able to find 2 properly working memory
modules out of 6. Also tested with several different brands. However
A7N8X rev 1 runs fine without need for carefully picking memory modules.
Memory test may need to be run over 48 hours to detect errors. But the
time required may be lower when running Linux kernel.
