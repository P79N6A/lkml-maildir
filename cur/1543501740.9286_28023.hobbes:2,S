I know this won't help the current situation, but for the future, how
about changing the way syscalls are invoked.  Instead of using int
0x80, do a jump to an absolute location which in turn does the int
0x80.  The page that includes the instructions to do system-calls
could be COWable.  For a virgin process, a default page is mapped into
the process vm-space. This would make it possible to intercept
system-calls in user-space with a small overhead.
One can also imagine that this page will be kept across exec so that
you can "preload" a library and all processes forking out of that
process will have that library "preloaded".
