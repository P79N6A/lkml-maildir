Yeah, historically we have avoided things like this.
kcalloc gets proposed every year or so too.

Well, I'll note that ALSA compartmentalizes their ioctl32 handling 
within their own subsystem, which seems like a decent solution.
That said, [maybe I'm biased <g>], using an fs interface allows one to 
completely eliminate an ioctl32 interface.  That would be the direction 
I would greatly prefer by the time 2.5.x hits the code freeze.
Best regards, and congrats for getting it merged,
