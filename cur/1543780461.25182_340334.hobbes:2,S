 "...I have a dream, were all OEM's will sell their systems and allow
you to choose from your preffered Distro" just like you do when it makes
you choose between XP Home or Professional.
Since I am a Linux user and moved from M$, I have a commandment, which
is, Thou Shalt not buy hardware from people that don't care about Linux.
So far, I'm looking for a video card manufacturer that is *good* and
that has Open Source drivers. But this is another story, and this only
me being too crazy. ;-)
Anyway, ndiswrapper is good, but is a "workaround" for hardware
manufacturers.
