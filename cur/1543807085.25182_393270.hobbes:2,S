Well,
cdrecord is done as good as possible. 
Note that if peope send a patch together with personal infringements or 
untrue claims, the best I can do is to ignore alltogether.
I did spend a lot of time with a fruitful discussion with Matthias.
Then Matthias started this thread.... It now seems like Matthias 
does not like to be serious anymore.
I am of course interested to make cdrecord better, but for the price
of spending an ridiculously amount of time ob LKML.
