Sure. Doing 'char c[4] = "01234";' is just like doing '"0123"': only 
those bytes, for which there's space in the array go in, everything makes 
perfect sense. What doesn't make sense to me though, is that in the former 
case gcc warns, but not in the latter.
Maybe you're right in your interpretation of the standard / K&R, but it 
doesn't still make it logical to me, sorry. I always thought "0123" was 5 
bytes long (ok, ascii) and the terminating '\0' was an integral part of 
the string, no different from any other character, and not some optional 
token. Thus all the charecters should be handled equally.
Thanks
