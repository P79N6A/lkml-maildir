Rik is concerned to get a glibc version which allows him to test the
improvements.  That's really not a big problem.  We laready have a
patch for this and can provide appropriate RPMs easily.
I don't want to set a precedence for adding glibc support for phantom
features.  So, I would not add support to the official glibc anyway
until there is a fixed implementation which then also means a fixed
ABI.  So, Andrew, applying the patch won't do any good.
