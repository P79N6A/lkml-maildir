Just to clarify...   32MB would never ever be reached.  The S/G table 
limit means requests are limited to 8MB.  VM thresholds and user 
application use further limit request size.
I think Andrew's point is actually more relevant than examining the size 
of a single request:

Thus like the "1,000 disks" example, memory management needs to make 
sure that an "unreasonable" amount of memory is not being pinned.
