Hi!

Sysctl seems really strange to me. Either the feature is safe to use,
or it is not. Users can already ulimit -c 0, and we do not have
"/proc/sys/kernel/allow_users_to_disable_their_core_dumps".
Plus, this is pretty analogical to ulimit -c, so I believe it should
be implemented like that one. You'll need less locking that way.
