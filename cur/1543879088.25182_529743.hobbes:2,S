Subject: [PATCH 0/4] UML - I/O improvements and small fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/11/213

These are 2.6.22 material.  Two of them are improvements to the block
driver, one causes UML to dump core on a panic, and the other is a bug
fix.
