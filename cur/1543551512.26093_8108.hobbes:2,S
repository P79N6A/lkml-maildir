   32bits on the ultrsparc/alpha ?
Yes, this issue occurred to me last night as well.
It is 32-bit on Alpha/UltraSparc.
However, given the fact that this number measures "pages", the
PAGE_SIZE on Ultra/Alpha, and the size of the 64-bit user address
space on Ultra and Alpha, it would actually end up working.
This doesn't make it a good idea though.
