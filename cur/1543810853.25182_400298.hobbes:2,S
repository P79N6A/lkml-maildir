couldnt the new pte be flipped in atomically via cmpxchg? That way we 
could do the page clearing close to where we are doing it now, but 
without holding the mmap_sem.
to solve the pte races we could use a bit in the [otherwise empty] pte 
to signal "this pte can be flipped in from now on", which bit would 
automatically be cleared if mprotect() or munmap() is called over that 
range (without any extra changes to those codepaths). (in the rare case 
if the cmpxchg() fails, we go into a slowpath that drops the newly 
allocated page, re-lookups the vma and the pte, etc.)
