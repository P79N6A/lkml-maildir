Here's your E820 memory map, from dmesg:
BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000008f000 (usable)
BIOS-e820: 000000000008f000 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 00000000cf58f000 (usable)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf58f000 - 00000000cf59c000 (reserved)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf59c000 - 00000000cf653000 (usable)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf653000 - 00000000cf6a5000 (ACPI NVS)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6a5000 - 00000000cf6a8000 (ACPI data)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6a8000 - 00000000cf6ef000 (ACPI NVS)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6ef000 - 00000000cf6f1000 (ACPI data)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6f1000 - 00000000cf6f2000 (usable)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6f2000 - 00000000cf6ff000 (ACPI data)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6ff000 - 00000000cf700000 (usable)
BIOS-e820: 00000000cf700000 - 00000000d0000000 (reserved)
BIOS-e820: 00000000fff00000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
BIOS-e820: 0000000100000000 - 000000022c000000 (usable)
so the usable memory ranges are:
0-572K
1MB-3317.55MB
3317.60MB-3317.75MB
3318.94MB-3318.945MB
3318.996MB-3319MB
4096MB-8896MB
and the MTRRs (from /proc/mtrr, from private email):
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=2048MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x80000000 (2048MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0xc0000000 (3072MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg03: base=0xcf800000 (3320MB), size=   8MB: uncachable, count=1
reg04: base=0xcf700000 (3319MB), size=   1MB: uncachable, count=1
reg05: base=0x100000000 (4096MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
reg06: base=0x200000000 (8192MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
reg07: base=0x220000000 (8704MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
so the ranges mapped as cacheable are:
0-3319MB
4096-8832MB
leaving 64MB of memory at the top of RAM uncached. What do you want to
bet that something important (kernel code?) is getting loaded there..
So essentially it's a BIOS problem, it's not setting up the MTRRs
properly in order to map all of RAM as cacheable. As Andi says, complain
to Intel.
