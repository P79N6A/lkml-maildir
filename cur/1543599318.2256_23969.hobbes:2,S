I don't have any direct EISA experience on Linux, but the
Linux Device Drivers book (remember that one?) says:
"EISA devices are configured by software, but they don't need any
particular operating system
support. EISA drivers already exist in the Linux kernel for Ethernet
devices and SCSI controllers."
and
"As far as the driver is concerned, there is no special support for
EISA in the kernel, and the
programmer must deal with ISA extensions by himself. The driver uses
standard EISA I/O
operations to access the EISA registers. The drivers that are already
in the kernel can be used as
sample code."
See (and read) 
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch15.html
and some drivers that already do this.
