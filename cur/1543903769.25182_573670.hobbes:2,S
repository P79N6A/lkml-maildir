Yes you are right. I have shown only an excerpt of the semantic patch.
Sorry. There is another rule:
@ rule3 depends on rule1 && !rule1bis @
struct net_device *dev;
@@
- dev->priv
+ netdev_priv(dev)
If you look at my patch there is one such case
-	struct tok_info *ti = dev->priv;
+	struct tok_info *ti = netdev_priv(dev);
