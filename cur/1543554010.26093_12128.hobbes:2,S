I've got a Toshiba Satellite Pro 4280xdvd + 3com cardbus 10/100 card. Works
fine with Red Hat 7, and also with 2.2.18pre20 + latest pcmcia-cs tools (X
doesn't work out of the box, I had to grab an X server from somewhere for
the S3 Savage IX the machine has. The builtin Lucent winmodem is hopeless,
BTW: The Lucent drivers just crash the kernel once the call is answered.)
