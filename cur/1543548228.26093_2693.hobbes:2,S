   So our TCP stack can observe this and say "ah, that route doesn't
   do ECN; let's retry without ECN and see if we get a better
   response".
This might work.  Although, a tougher case to handle are the
firewalls which just silently drop the packet if ECN bits are
set.  The timeout is just too long to make a "backdown and try
withough ECN" scheme worthwhile in that case.
