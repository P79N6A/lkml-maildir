These "function(unsigned int *classes)" style functions in 
"libata-core.c" worry me somewhat.  Esp. that sometimes you have one class,
sometimes two.
This looks like a bug waiting to happen for me.
Could we somehow get a 
struct ata_classes {
	unsigned int master;
	unsigned int slave;
}
here (or similiar), before this is in used everywhere?
Usage would be function(struct ata_classes *classes) then.
Thanks & Regards
