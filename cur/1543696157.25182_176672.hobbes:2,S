Strange enough I have an Abit NF7-s Rev2.0 as well, but for me the 
driver works - somehow. I havbe latest bios 1.9 (modified with latest 
silicon image bios). Since siimage 1.06 drvier. I have DMA without using 
hdparm, but it is not as fast as in windows. With kernel 2.6 tranfer 
dropped very much to about 20mb/s (playing with read-aheed didn't help). 
But I am getting this error messages in dmesg and at boot up (that's why 
I commented it out in siimage.c):
hde: sata_error = 0x00000000, watchdog = 0, siimage_mmio_ide_dma_test_irq
Other than that it runs fine - forgetting that performance it bad right 
now. Tried various shedulers, but didn't help. With kernel 2.4.22-ac4 I 
had about 37mb/sec, now only 20mb/sec...
