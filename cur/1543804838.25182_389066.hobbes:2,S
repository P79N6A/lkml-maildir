The online resizing support in ext3 only grows the filesystems; it
doesn't shrink it.  What is currently supported in 2.6 requires you to
reserve space in advance.  There is also a slight modification to the
ext2/3 filesystem format which is only supported by Linux 2.6 which
allows you to grow the filesystem without needing to move filesystem
data structures around; the kernel patches for actualling doing this
new style of online resizing aren't yet in mainline yet, although they
have been posted to ext2-devel for evaluation.

That doesn't really help, because in order to release the unused disk
blocks, you have to walk every single inode and keep track of the
block allocation bitmaps for the entire filesystem.  If you have a
really big filesystem, it may require hundreds of megabytes of
non-swappable kernel memory.  And if you try to do this in userspace,
it becomes an unholy mess trying to keep the userspace and in-kernel
mounted filesystem data structures in sync.
