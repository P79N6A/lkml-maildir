Ok, let me say, I'm using Debian 2 kernel 2.2.0-pre3 with
GNU bash, version 2.01.1(1)-release (i486-pc-linux-gnu)
and the problem is always reproducible with this simple steps:
1) cd /usr/src/linux
2) mv .config .config.ORG
3) make menuconfig
4) move the cursor over the "Character devices  --->" submenu with down
key
5) press "space key" to select this submenu
6) move the cursor over the "Mice  --->" with down key ( strange jump
here )
7) press "space key" to select this submenu
8) finally move the cursor down until last entry "< > PC110 digitizer
pad support"
9) make: *** [menuconfig] Error 139 ( on my Linux box )
This from my mail to Peter:
 Hi Peter, 
 
 Find it ! :) It's funny but this appear *only* when I use
 "space" instead of *Enter* to select submenus :)))
 
 Since the menuconfig report:
 
 > Arrow keys navigate the menu.  <Enter> selects submenus
--->.            
 > Highlighted letters are hotkeys.  Pressing <Y> includes, <N>
excludes,

Help.

 this is a my mistake ( but space acts like Enter ;).
 
 If you can reply this with my test using space instead enter key
 I think that this information can be shared with other in the ml too
 or maybe this is a well know situation ;)
