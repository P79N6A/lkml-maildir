This one was discussed mostly on the ARM mailing-list and finally made his way 
to the mainline kernel. Though it lacks some functions to change for instance 
a entire GPIO line and not a single bit, it is used on ARM and MIPS systems 
so I would conform with this one for now because it is used by at least two 
or more architectures.
