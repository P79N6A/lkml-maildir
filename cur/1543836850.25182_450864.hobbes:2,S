Hi Pavel,
Thanks for the sign-offs!

None that I found. Many drivers do it this way.

Yes, we may end up needing to lock away other systems (ACPI?) that
touch the same ports. Apparently not an issue right now, but could
change with new firmware.
Also, that's what Alan Cox told me to do. :-)

OK.
"++i" is the recommended form for C++, got used to that.

On a local variable?!

Not sure what's the right one. The user tried to load a module and the
module can't do that; I saw some drivers use KERN_ERR some
KERN_WARNING in similar cases. Is there some guideline on choosing
printk levels?
OK on all other points.
