I reproduced this on one box, but then it turned out that EIP was at line 195
of mm/vmscan.c where there was
do_div(delta, lru_pages + 1);
Well, I have no idea how this can lead to a divide error (lru_pages is
unsigned).
I'm unable to reproduce this on another i386 box, so it seems to be somewhat
configuration specific.
Does 2.6.20-rc1 work for you?
