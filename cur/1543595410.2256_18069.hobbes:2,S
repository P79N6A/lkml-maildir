Well, I for one use the 2.2 ide patches extensively (on almost all of my
machines, including a heavy-duty backup server), and haven't seen any
problems whatsoever. I see _much_ more problems with scsi (aic7xxx), for
example.
I don't mean to say the ide patches are 100% bug free, but I wouldn't
consider them as the prime suspect for an oops that happened elsewhere
either. It could be hw or any other part of kernel just as well... What
about memtest86?
