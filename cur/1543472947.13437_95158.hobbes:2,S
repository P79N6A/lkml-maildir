/* 
 * sterilize.c - by Colin Plumb.
 * Version 1.01
 *
 * Do a secure overwrite of given files or devices, so that not even
 * very expensive hardware probing can recover the data.
 *
 * For the theory behind this, see "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic
 * and Solid-State Memory", on line at
 * 
http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html
 *
 * Although this processs is also known as "wiping", I prefer the longer
 * name both because I think it is more evocative of what is happening and
 * because a longer name conveys a more appropriate sense of deliberateness.
 *
 * If asked to wipe a file, this also deletes it, renaming it to in a
 * clever way to try to leave no trace of the original filename.
 *
 * Copyright 1997, 1998 Colin Plumb <colin@nyx.net>.  This program may
 * be freely distributed under the terms of the GNU, BSD or Artistic
 * licenses.  Even if you use the BSD license, which does not require it,
 * I'd really like to get improvements back.
 *
 * The ISAAC code still bears some resemblance to the code written
 * by Bob Jenkins, but he permits pretty unlimited use.
 *
 * This was inspired by a desire to improve on some code titled:
 * Wipe V1.0-- Overwrite and delete files.  S. 2/3/96
 * but I've rewritten everything here so completely that no trace of
 * the original remains.
