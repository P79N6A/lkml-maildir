I'm really not against the extent based page cache idea, but I kind of
assumed it would be too big a change for this kind of generic setup.  At
any rate, if we'd like to do it, it may be best to ditch the idea of
"attach mapping information to a page", and switch to "lookup mapping
information and range locking for a page".
A btree could be used to hold the range mapping and locking, but it
could just as easily be a radix tree where you do a gang lookup for the
end of the range (the same way my placeholder patch did).  It'll still
find intersecting range locks but is much faster for random
insertion/deletion than the btrees.
