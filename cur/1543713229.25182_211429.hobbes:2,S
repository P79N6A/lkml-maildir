Sounds good, but you missed the hell part.
What happens, if you copyfile() a file that has two links?
Then you link() the result.
Then you copyfile() one of those two links.
Then you link()...
Now you write to either one of the six files.  What happens?
Give me a clean proposal how this is simple, defined and not too
dangerous for the unaware.  Then I agree, there is no hell involved.
