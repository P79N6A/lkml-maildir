oops.  What problem was this observed to cause btw?

OK, I'll take a look at that thanks.

This code is buggy.  See

The code in shrink_cache() has a couple of problems.
a) If someone else is truncating the file at the same time,
   block_write_full_page() will see the page is outside i_size and will
   return -EIO.  That will be propagated into the address_space and
   userspace will see a bogus I/O error.
   Fix: just return zero from writepage-outside-i_size.  There are several
   instances.
b) Can't touch `mapping' after calling writepage().  The page can now be
   unlocked, truncated off the inode and the inode could be freed up.
   No, I don't have a testcase ;)
   The fix is to lock the page again, see if it still has a ->mapping,
   then set mapping->error.
