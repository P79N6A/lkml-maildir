Wrong. How can the fact that a suspend/resume cycle increment the id be
worst than the fact that the same cycle return idx to the previous
state?
The argument you have against this patch is WRONG.
You think about NICs in a PCI slot. 
That's changed the day the cardbus support was moved from pcmcia to the
today implementation.
You can't expect cardbus user to stop using the suspend mode because you
expect your id to be attributed one time (that doesn't even make sense).
I agree that this patch is not a full fix (I said it in my original
post) but I disagree that it does any bad things. I would be interested
to learn about a real case ?
But ethtool seems to be very interesting and it looks like what I was
looking for. I will have a closer look at it, thank you for pointing it
to me.

NO -- If I can remove/insert suspend/remove my card as I want I ever get
the same ID. 
If you want to fail the patch you need to remove/insert 2 cards in FILO
order. Then you will get a ever bigger ID but this is what you get by
default without the patch.

I am waiting for a real case.

Noted.
