	When I say "you", I mean the general consensus.  You can scream
"don't do this" as loud as you want, the world might drown you out.  Not
every random person that sees "new extents in ext3" is going to know
that Alex is the authority.  They certainly aren't going to read the
documentation.  They'll read some comment on some website that says "all
you need is '-o extents'!"
