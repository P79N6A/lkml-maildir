Call out to user space if it is complex. But it only takes few lines
of code to to these things on a radeon.

Something needs to bind to the hardware, that code is in the device
specific fbdev drivers currently. The fbdev drivers also contain those
small functions I mentioned like cmap, cursor, etc. Some of the fbdev
drivers also contain initialization code.
If fbdev is eliminated the DRM code will need to provide a compatible
fbdev device in user space for legacy apps. It makes sense to get that
code from fbdev.
Any concerns about having two device nodes for a single piece of
hardware, fb0 and dri0? Since dri0 has a single user it may be
possible to rework its IOCTLs to use the fb0 device.
As part of multiuser support you need to make one device per head
instead of one device per card. Each independent user needs their own
deivce to control.
