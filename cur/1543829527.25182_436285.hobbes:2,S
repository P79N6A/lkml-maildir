Sounds good.

I do not think that statistics are that important. One of the primary
advantages is that this fixes up a way to deadlock the machine through
dirtying too many pages. The other side effect is that dirty page
writeout can begin before an application terminates. We have had cases
where dirty memory was sitting for weeks in a machine because the process
did not terminate. These are major VM issues that need a resolution.
Also Peter has made the tracking configurable. So there is a way
to switch it off if it is harmful for some situations.

You mean anonymous pages? Anonymous pages are always dirty unless
you consider swap and we currently do not take account of dirty anonymous 
pages. With swap we already have performance problems and maybe there are
additional issues to fix in that area. But these are secondary.
