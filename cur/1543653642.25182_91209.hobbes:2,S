It seems that sometime in the recent 2.5 progress (probably when initrd
changes went in), the root device naming changed.
Specifying "root=LABEL=/" used to work, now the only valid parameter
seems to be a actual device (as in "root=/dev/hda2" ).
Is this an intentional change? or a bug introduced?
Is there an existing patch to fix it?
