I just saw this problem with 2.5.30.
I can't mount my 2nd volume on a cciss controller (SmartArray 5i)
< /dev/cciss/c0d1p1 /u1
No such device or address
The first volume, /dev/cciss/c0d0p1, works fine
(I'm booted from it.)
Reboot 2.5.29, both volumes work fine.
I don't have time to look into this right now,
but I thought I'd mention it in case someone else
does have time.  Looks like there was some partition 
code and/or devfs changes...
