Sounds like bad memory to me.  The only other report of this I've seen
was at
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=115935
and that machine didn't pass memtest86.

Bad hardware is about the only way I can think of.  If it was a random
kernel memory scribble, you'd expect it to show up in other places too:
the transaction struct is a very very long-lived struct, you wouldn't
expect it to be the only place to show up slab corruptions.
Cheers,
 Stephen
