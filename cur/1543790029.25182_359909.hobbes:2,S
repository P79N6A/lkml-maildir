The trouble with >= 2 is that it then leaves the unsplit page_table_lock
path untested, since UP isn't using page_table_lock at all.  While it's
true that the unsplit page_table_lock path has had a long history of
testing, it's not inconceivable that I could have screwed it up.
With the default at 4, I think we've got quite good coverage between
those who configure NR_CPUS down to the 2 they actually have,
and those who leave it at its default or actually have 4.
