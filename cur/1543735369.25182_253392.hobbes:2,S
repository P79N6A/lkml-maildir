Hi there,
here comes a patchset consisting of 14 patches bringing the in-kernel 
DVB subsystem in sync with the LinuxTV.org CVS driver.
The most important changes include:
- remove non-linux compatibility stuff
- remove home-brewn dvb-i2c stuff, use kernel-i2c instead
- convert home-brewn bttv i2c access drivers to real bttv sub-drivers
- add new driver for mobile USB Budget DVB-T devices by DiBcom
- add new drivers for Zarlink DVB-T MT352 frontend, Conexant 22702 DVB 
OFDM frontend and DVB-T demodulator DiBcom 3000-MB frontend
- plus lots of other changes, explained in the top of each patch.
Please apply. Thanks!
Regards.
Michael Hunold.
