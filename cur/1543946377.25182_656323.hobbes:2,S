Subject: [PATCH 3/4] MN10300: Make the kernel jump into gdbstub on a BUG
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/19/334

Make the kernel jump into gdbstub (if configured) on a BUG with the register
set from the BUG rather than interpolating another illegal instruction and
leaving gdbstub's idea of the process counter in unsupported_syscall() where
the original BUG was detected.
With this patch, gdbstub reports a SIGABRT to the compiler and reports the
program counter at the original BUG, allowing the execution state at the time
of the BUG to be examined with GDB.
