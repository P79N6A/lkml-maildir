This code is a lazy hack to achieve "genericness" by using
a "generic" inline functions and #defines to create
specialized instances.

Unforunately you can't do this without further restructuring,
look at how the tc actions use that file:
/* use generic hash table */
#define MY_TAB_SIZE     8
#define MY_TAB_MASK     (MY_TAB_SIZE - 1)
static u32 idx_gen;
static struct tcf_mirred *tcf_mirred_ht[MY_TAB_SIZE];
static DEFINE_RWLOCK(mirred_lock);
/* ovewrride the defaults */
#define tcf_st          tcf_mirred
#define tc_st           tc_mirred
#define tcf_t_lock      mirred_lock
#define tcf_ht          tcf_mirred_ht
#define CONFIG_NET_ACT_INIT 1
#include <net/pkt_act.h>
What needs to be done is to put a pointer to the hash, its size
and its lock in struct tc_action_ops and move the "generic"
functions to a seperate .c file and make them work on a struct
tcf_act_common.
