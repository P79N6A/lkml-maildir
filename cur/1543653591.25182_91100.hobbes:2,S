one thing to note is that the kernel's compilation is not something that
parallelizes well to above 8 CPUs. Our make architecture creates many link
points which serialize 'threads of compilation'.
i'd try two things:
 1) try Erich Focht's NUMA enhancements to the load balancer.
 2) remove the -pipe flag from arch/i386/Makefile
the later thing will reduce the number of processes and makes compilation
more localized to a single CPU - which might (or might not) help NUMA
architectures.
