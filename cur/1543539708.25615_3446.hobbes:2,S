If manufacturers of IDE disks ship a product that can be made to break
itself by issuing commands to it, then they cannot blame OS developers
and vendors for that fault.  Quite simply they are deliberately shipping
broken hardware, and trying to blame other people when it breaks.
You're buying into that whole farce, Andre.  It's not your fault or
Linus's fault that those drives can be made to break.  You might try to
put code in the IDE driver to prevent it from issuing these commands,
but anyone with root access to the system can arrange to issue those
commands through a number of other methods (access to /dev/port,
inserting a module with an old version of the IDE driver, etc.).  So
what are you really protecting us from?  If you think the drive
manufacturers will blame us for allowing self-destruct commands to be
issued to their drives, then I doubt they'll stop blaming us merely
because you put checks in the IDE driver when so many other avenues
exist.
