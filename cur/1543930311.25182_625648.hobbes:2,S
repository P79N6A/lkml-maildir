ok :-)
the scariest bit isnt even the scaling i think - that is a fairly 
straightforward and clean PER_CPU-ization of the global scaling factor, 
and its hookup with cpufreq events. (and the credit for that goes to 
Guillaume Chazarain) We could even split it into two to make it even 
less scary and more bisectable.
the scariest bit is the adding of cpu_clock() to kernel/printk.c so late 
in the game, and the anti-recursion code i did there. Maybe because this 
only affects CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME we could try it even for v2.6.24.
i've now completed a couple of hundred random bootups on x86 overnight, 
with the full stack of these patches applied, and no problems.
Could have a really critical look at the two patches below and give your 
Reviewed-by line(s) if you agree with having them in v2.6.24? I'd feel a 
lot better about this that way :-) I do have the feeling that it makes 
printk printout a lot more robust in general, independently of the 
cpu_clock() change - especially with more complex consoles like 
netconsole or fbcon.

Subject: printk: make printk more robust by not allowing recursion
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
make printk more robust by allowing recursion only if there's a crash
going on. Also add recursion detection.
I've tested it with an artificially injected printk recursion - instead
of a lockup or spontaneous reboot or other crash, the output was a well
controlled:
[   41.057335] SysRq : <2>BUG: recent printk recursion!
[   41.057335] loglevel0-8 reBoot Crashdump show-all-locks(D) tErm Full kIll saK showMem Nice powerOff showPc show-all-timers(Q) unRaw Sync showTasks Unmount shoW-blocked-tasks
also do all this printk-debug logic with irqs disabled.

Subject: sched: fix CONFIG_PRINT_TIME's reliance on sched_clock()
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Stefano Brivio reported weird printk timestamp behavior during
CPU frequency changes:
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9475
fix CONFIG_PRINT_TIME's reliance on sched_clock() and use cpu_clock()
instead.
