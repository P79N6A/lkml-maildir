IRIX has had a devfs-like thing since the Origin came out (IRIX
6.4). It's a hybrid system, with physical devices created
dynamically under /hw, and /dev contains links to the physical
devices, and "regular" device files for software devices (ptys,
etc). dev_t is uint32_t. A program (ioconfig) runs at boot time to
fix /dev to match changes in /hw, and to set permissions to allow
non-root access. MAKEDEV is much reduced... Drivers for physical
devices don't *have* to use /hw, but they fit in a lot better.
This mechanism has been working successfully (with few bugs that I
am aware of), and shipping, for >3 years. It runs on "desktops to
supercomputers", though it was designed for the needs of the bigger
boxen.
