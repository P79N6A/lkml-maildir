FWIW, there is a precedent from FreeBSD for a MAP_HASSEMAPHORE flag
meaning "this region may contain semaphores".
I don't know if that implies anything about the support of futex system
calls, but it may be the appropriate flag to indicate "atomic operations
are seen as such between processes on these pages".
