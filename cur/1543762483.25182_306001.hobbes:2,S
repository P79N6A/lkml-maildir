It is not only about userspace/kernelspace system calls and data
copying,
but about whole revalidation process, which can and is quite expensive,
due to system calls, copying and validating itself,
I even think that using userspace rng daemon is completely useless for 
crypto HW devices - it is faster to obtain entropy from interrupts, 
than revalidating it in that way.
And what about initial bootup? When system needs to create randoom
IP/dhcp/any ids? What about small router?
There are too many cases where userspace validation is just making
things worse.
