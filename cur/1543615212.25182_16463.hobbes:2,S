Subject: ide.2.4.16.12102001.patch: please provide help for new config options

Andre,
I downloaded the ide.2.4.16.12102001.patch from linuxdiskcert.org and I 
applied it to 2.4.17. Compiles fine, but now I'm looking for documentation 
and there doesn't seem to be any on linuxdiskcert.org. Could you provide 
us with basic help text for the following new configuration options?
CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE
CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL
CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_FORCED
CONFIG_IDEDMA_ONLYDISK
Which ones are we supposed to enable for better performance, reliability, 
etc. and which ones are for compatibility? I would guess 
CONFIG_IDEDMA_ONLYDISK pertains to the latter category for example.
Please CC me, I'm not on linux-kernel.
