But if you're using PAE, you've got > 4G of RAM, so there's no need to
be clever trying to avoid HIGHMEM options.
Unfortunately, I just had a server with Con's patch detonate overnight
(Oops in interrupt -> panic; details in separate e-mail), and wli tells
me that there are additional places in the code that need fixing.
I notice that all previous patches had the kernel range a power of 2 in size.
Is this required somewhere?  I thought it was just that the kernel
had to start at a PGD boundary (4M on normal x86, 1G on PAE).
If 128M is always enough, a split at 0xb800000 seems possible, but
giving it an extra 128M seems like a nice bit of safety for PCI devices.
