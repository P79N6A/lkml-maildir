btw., do you really need 100,000 samples to get statistically stable
results? I've been running with 1000 samples and it was already more
than usable - i'd say 3000-5000 samples ought to be more than enough.

are you sure the theoretical limit is 2 msec? I think it's 3 msec, for
the following reason:
there are two types of nonprivileged-task lock sequences allowed in the
2-deep case:
	spin_lock(&lock2);
	spin_lock(&lock1);
	... loop for 1 msec ...
	spin_unlock(&lock1);
	spin_unlock(&lock2);
or:
	spin_lock(&lock1);
	... loop for 1 msec ...
	spin_unlock(&lock1);
now, with the above locking, the worst case scenario is the following
one, in chronological order [task A and B are unprivileged, RT is the
highprio task]:
	task-A			task-B			task-RT
	spin_lock(&lock2);
	[ gets lock2 ]
				spin_lock(&lock1);
				[ gets lock1 ]
							spin_lock(&lock2);
							[ boosts task-A ]
							[ waits ]
	[ gets RT prio ]				.
	spin_lock(&lock1);				.
	[ boosts task-B ]				.
	[ waits ]					.
	.			[ gets RT prio ]	.
	.			[ 1 msec loop ]		.
	.			spin_unlock(&lock1);	.
	[ gets lock 1 ]					.
				spin_lock(&lock1);	.
				[ waits ]		.
	[ 1 msec loop ]		.			.
	spin_unlock(&lock1);	.			.
				[ gets lock1 ]		.
	spin_unlock(&lock2);				.
							[ gets lock2 ]
							spin_lock(&lock1);
							[ boosts task-B ]
							[ waits ]
				[ 1 msec loop ]		.
				spin_unlock(&lock1);	.
							[ gets lock1 ]
the additional 1 msec comes in because the RT task might be blocking on
a task that _itself_ has to wait 1 msec to get its second lock. So we
have 3 msec of maximum waiting altogether.
the additional +1 msec comes from the fact that 1-deep lock/unlock of
lock1 is an allowed operation too - 2 msec would be the limit if the
only sequence is the 2-deep one.
so i think the numbers, at least in the 2-deep case, are quite close to
the theoretical boundary.
agreed?
