"First" works.
"Second" doesn't:
intelfb says that the initial video mode is 640x400-8@69. This might
be correct (I did not count :)).
But during the boot, the display of messages seems to be shifted upwards
(the shift is about 3 or 4 text lines).
And switching from X to fbcon is still broken, but not as previously
(dirty vertical lines without text). Now, the 3 bottom pixel lines of
the last text line of the display ("host login:") are shown regularly
everywhere on the screen.
