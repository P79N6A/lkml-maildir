So just what is it used for?  On the x86, the math on it is used 
mostly (aside from LATCH) to figure out the actual value of 1/HZ. 
This is then used to compute a more correct TICK_NSEC which is added 
to xtime each tick.  This usage of CLOCK_TICK_RATE just "beats it up" 
to see how close the hardware can get to the requested rate of 1/HZ. 
Since this code is in time.h and timex.h, it is shared with all the archs.
I submit that if it is not used to actually compute a LATCH value for 
the 1/HZ tick, it should just be some rather large value that more or 
less represents the granularity of the hardwares ability to generate 
1/HZ ticks.  Once it gets above about 100MHZ, I think it actually 
drops out of the calculations.  The last thing we want to do at this 
point is make it a variable.  (Nor do you want to put a -E in your cc 
command and take a look at what is produced for the conversion constants.)
If it is not possible to make it a constant, I think we need to 
revisit the timer conversion code as we would not only have a LOT of 
code bloat, but it would add far too much time to the conversions.
