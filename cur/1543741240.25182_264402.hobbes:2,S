The number is 240 and it's the number of possible PS/2 scancode
combinations, and since at this time X can only understand the PS/2
protocol (and not native Linux events), this is the only way how to pass
keypresses to X.
I believe that although this way may be easier, it leads to madness.

IIRC X has only 8 modifier keys and all are already defined and you
can't define any more. But I doubt you're using all of them on your
keyboard. It should be possible to assign Fn to one of them.
