As I told you, current ppc timer.c should already bind on
timebase and so be safe with increased DEC irq frequency.

I don't think it is on PPC, though I'm still thinking about
it to also provide userspace with some stuff like atomic ops
etc... so that CPU specific workarounds like additional
sync's on 405gp can be left out of glibc.
I'll look for more detailed infos about the G4 bug, possibly
tomorrow or next week.
Ben.
