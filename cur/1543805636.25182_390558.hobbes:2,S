I looked at the assembler code generated on parisc with 4.1.0 (prerelease).
The toernig code is definitely inferior.  The mita sequence is four
instructions longer than the arm sequence, but it didn't have any branches.
The arm sequence has four branches.  Thus, it's not clear to me which
would perform better in the real world.  There were no nullified instructions
generated for any of the sequences.  However, neither is as good as the
handcraft asm sequence currently being used.
