I can just about make it on 2xXeons at 3.0GHz, HT enabled, 4GB RAM. But 
the new "Core 2 Duo" stuff is tons faster, is dual core but no HT yet, 
has better cache, faster memory bus... costs more. Some big NUMA 
hardware after that,
I will guess the new cheap point is o/c Core 2 Duo 6700, and will finish 
in about 7 min. Patience is a virtue.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
