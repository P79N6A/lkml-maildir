On the other hand, filesystem corruption bugs are one of the worst type to suffer from.  We absolutely don't want to include filesystems without at least a reasonable proven track record in the mainline kernel, and therefore encourage the various distributions to use them, incase any bugs do show up.  Look how long a buffer overflow existed in Zlib unnoticed.
EXT2 is a very capable filesystem, and has *years* of proven reliability.  That's why I'm not going to switch away from it for critical work any time soon.
