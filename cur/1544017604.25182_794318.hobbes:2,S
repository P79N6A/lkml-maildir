Nope. headers_install only unifdef __KERNEL__ stuff.

This is wrong...
The headers does not change with the kernel configuration and advertising the
kvm features via a .h file like this is simply plain broken.
You cannot assume that the header files are generated with the exact same config
as used by the running kernel.
And userspace has in no way access to the CONFIG_ namespace which is purely kernel-internal.
I cannot see how you have ever seen kcm advertise that for example KVM_CAP_USER_NMI
equals to 22 because CONFIG_X86 is never (supposed to be) defined in userspace -
except if you did so yourself by some means.
