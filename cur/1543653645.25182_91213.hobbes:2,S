strace the program then, what is happening? What I saw was a program
seeing write() return 0, assuming it didn't write anything, rewrite the
whole thing. Repeat.
I bet this wouldn't happen if just sysfs didn't allow write open of a
file that doesn't have any writeable bits. Smells like another sysfs
bug. Pat?
