I don't have exact details, but a similar thing happened to me.
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel: eth0: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100], 00:A0:C9:10:63:9C, IRQ 9.
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel:   Board assembly 645477-004, Physical connectors present: RJ45 BNC AUI
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel:   Primary interface chip 80c24 PHY #0.
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel:   General self-test: passed.
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel:   Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel:   Internal registers self-test: passed.
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel:   ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x49caa8d6).
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel:   Receiver lock-up workaround activated.
Oct 16 16:46:54 mauve kernel: eth1: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (#2), 00:A0:C9:10:82:37, IRQ 11.
<snip exactly identical startup for the other eepro100>
Oct 16 16:49:10 mauve kernel: Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.9 (August 11, 2000)
Oct 16 16:49:10 mauve kernel: eth2: Digital DS21140 Tulip rev 34 at 0xf000, 00:40:05:30:BF:8F, IRQ 10.
Oct 16 16:49:10 mauve kernel: eth2:  EEPROM default media type Autosense.
Oct 16 16:49:10 mauve kernel: eth2:  Index #0 - Media MII (#11) described by a 21140 MII PHY (1) block.
Oct 16 16:49:10 mauve kernel: eth2:  MII transceiver #8 config 3100 status 7849 advertising 01e1.
The Tulip card wouldn't respond, or send pings, and IIRC, came up with
3 errors per attempt to send a packet.
Both eepro100's worked fine.
It's a netgear FA310TX
If it'd be handy, I could do it again, and check exact results if needed.
