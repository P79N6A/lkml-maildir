This was the patch:
+if OPROFILE
+
+config OPROFILE_ARMV6
+	def_bool y
+	depends on CPU_V6 && !SMP
+	select OPROFILE_ARM11_CORE
+
+config OPROFILE_MPCORE
+	def_bool y
+	depends on CPU_V6 && SMP
+	select OPROFILE_ARM11_CORE
+
+config OPROFILE_ARM11_CORE
+	bool
+
+endif
And none of these has a prompt defined so they do not show up
as a menu.
It is very easy to test if you have the patch applied.
No cross toolchin is needed - just do:
make ARCH=arm menuconfig
