It does appear to happen on a regular basis.
Should the 20ms delay be in the ISR though?
I thought it was standard practice to move such
lengthy operations outside of the ISR so as not to
impact interrupt latency for the system.

There are no USB devices attached to the server.
There are no actual USB connectors, and the
server's specs do not list USB. There is no
option to enable/disable USB in the BIOS.
So my guess is this is an unused portion of
the chipset being detected and enabled.
