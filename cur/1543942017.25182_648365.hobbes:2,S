Well, if you have need it to be exported for #2 or #3, then that's ok
by me - export it.
I'm unaware of any kernel/cpumask.c.  If you meant lib/cpumask.c, then
I'd prefer you not put it there, as lib/cpumask.c just contains the
implementation details of the abstract data type cpumask_t, not any of
its uses.  If you mean kernel/cpuset.c, then that's not a good choice
either, as that just contains the implementation details of the cpuset
subsystem.  You should usually define such things in one of the files
using it, and unless there is clearly a -better- place to move the
definition, it's usually better to just leave it where it is.
