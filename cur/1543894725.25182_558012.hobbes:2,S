Er, yes and no.
The GPL evolved from the "Emacs License", and _that_ was heavily influenced by 
Stallman's fight with James Gosling over Gosling revoking permission to use 
Gosmacs code in GNU Emacs after Gosling sold his codebase to a commercial 
entity.

The GNU project and the GPL are two separate things, as are the GNU project 
and GCC.  (You can use GCC on MacOS X, AIX, and Windows.  It doesn't make the 
existence of those operating systems the result of the GNU project.  Neither 
is Linux, although there's a case for Linux being the result of the ABSENCE 
of an actual operating system coming out of the Gnu project after a decade of 
work...)
