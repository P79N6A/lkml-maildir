Subject: small fix for nforce ide chipset driver in 2.5.54

I recently acquired an Epox 8RDA motherboard, which uses the Nforce2
chipset. While trying to compile 2.5.54 I ran across an error in
drivers/ide/pci/nvidia.c. Several times the define
PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCE_IDE is referenced, but is not defined
anywhere. It seems it is missing from include/linux/pci_ids.h. On my
board it shows up as:
00:09.0 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device 0065 (rev a2)
(prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
so I added a #define for PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCE_IDE as 0x0065. It
compiled fine and I am in fact running that kernel now. I would have
just sent a patch but I am new to kernel hacking, this is just a one
liner and I'm sure you know where it goes better than I do.
thanks, James
