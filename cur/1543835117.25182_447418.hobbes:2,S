They well can be. And it'd be pretty stupid to just throw away the
events the hardware offers to us and use polling from userspace, too.

You're joking, right? On quite a number of laptops, it takes quite a
while to read the battery, spent in BIOS through SMI, polling the I2C
bus while talking to the battery. The less often this is done, the
better.

The applets that were doing it (yes, up to 100 times per second)
corrected their ways pretty quickly, because some machines became
unusable with the applet enabled.

You could, trivially, mirror the behavior of current applets: Not report
the changes to the battery status more often than each N seconds, except
for critical events.
Said that, there haven't been many problems reported in the input layer
that I could attibute to bad default selection of fuzz.

May you be more specific here? I'm not aware of any problems in this
area. This may be my fault: What needs to be fixed there?
