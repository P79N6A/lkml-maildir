The main problem with current router based 802.1Q implementations is that the
firewalling, accounting and QoS for GigE capable equipment case have to be
expressed: quoting you "is still by using words that are not suited to be put
in print".
If you need QoS, namely class based queing and especially class based
accounting on lots of ethers the choice is obvious - move to FreeBSD (where
these have worked for ages) or Linux. Unfortunately 802.1q is not mainstream on
both of them (I checked BSD last time eof last year). 
Same stands for firewalls that need to control more than 3-4 segments. .1q
would simplify lots of things there.
Same stands for a single box serving lots of ptp ethers or /30 segments. F.E. 
ADSL ;-)
Same stands if you need to present your linux box in a lot of places for
broadcast protocols. Remote boot environments in a big building with a
subnetted LAN and dhcp or similar.
List can be continued by many more applications. 
Brgds,
