I'm not sure I have seen claims that it makes the kernel faster, but it
sure makes the latency lower, and improves performance for systems doing a
lot of network activity (DNS servers) with anything else going on in the
systems, such as daily reports and backups.
I will try the low latency kernel stuff, but I think intrinsically that if
you want to service the incoming requests quickly you have to dispatch to
them quickly, not at the end of a time slice. Preempt is a way to avoid
having to play with RT processes, and I think it's desirable in general as
an option where the load will benefit from such behaviour.
I'm not sure it "competes" with low latency, since many of the thing LL is
doing are "good things" in general.
Finally, I doubt that any of this will address my biggest problem with
Linux, which is that as memory gets cheap a program doing significant disk
writing can get buffers VERY full (perhaps a while CD worth) before the
kernel decides to do the write, at which point the system becomes
non-responsive for seconds at a time while the disk light comes on and
stays on. That's another problem, and I did play with some patches this
weekend without making myself really happy :-( Another topic,
unfortunately.
