Thank you, I didn't know about Jffs2; however I believe it is not an 
implemendation at the device level as I would like.

Since space efficiency is _not_ my aim I plan to forcibly allocate 3 physical 
blocks for every 2 "compressed" blocks (as it should (?) always fit with a 
dynamic Huffman encoding).

Oops ! I thought it was possible to guarantee with the Huffman encoding (which 
is more basic than Lempev-Zif) that the compressed data use no more than 1 
bit for every byte (i.e. 12,5% more space).

I am not sure that this is good news ;)

Unfortunately I failed to find substantial code/documentation on encryption 
plugin for Reiser4, for example. Do you know about some ?

Thank you, Guillaume.
