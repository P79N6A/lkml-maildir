We're not interested in the _total_ overhead, in this context. We're
interested in the number of bytes we have to have available in the
output buffer in order to let zlib finish its stream.
In the case of a 1MiB input generating 32 uncompressable 64KiB blocks,
the end markers for the first 31 blocks are going to be in our output
buffer already, so we don't need to leave space for them.
