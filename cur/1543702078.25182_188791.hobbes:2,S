simpler:
ssh -L<local>:127.0.0.1:<remote> [-C] user@host
eg I forward imap from home (not accessible outside localhost) and
jabber from a second machine at home:
ssh -L143:localhost:143 -L5222:jabber:5222 -C dis@home
Then just point the client at localhost:143 (or 5222) and it 'just
works'. No python required. 
For an added bonus, run a script on the far side that does something
like:
 while /bin/true; do 
    if [ -f .dienow ]; then 
      rm -f .dienow
      exit
    else sleep 60
  done
and on the local side:
 while /bin/true; do 
   ssh -L1:localhost:2 etc user@host ./remotescript 
   sleep 1
   if [ -f .dienow ]; do 
     scp .dienow user@host: && rm -f .dienow
   done
  done
..respawn the ssh forwards until it finds ~/.dienow (-and- the current
ssh exits) and then kill off both sides.  Don't flood the system by
respawning ssh more than once per 1-2 seconds. (And who said you
couldn't vpn with shell? You can even add/remove ports along the way, if
you get creative.)
