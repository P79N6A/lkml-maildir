Doesn't matter.
	CPU1 - do_exit()			CPU2 - non-nested task_lock()
						task_lock(tsk)
	write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);		IRQ HAPPENS
	task_lock(tsk);				read_lock(&tasklist_lock)
BOOM, you're dead.
See? ABBA _does_ happen with the task lock, it's just that the magic 
required to do so is fairly unlikely thanks to the added requirement for 
the irq to happen at just the right moment (ie there are no static 
code-paths that can cause it).
