Well, I for one have stopped with the spelling patches since the
cost/benefit ratio was too high for many key folks.  When the spelling
patches were being generated, we were quite careful not to "fix" English
spellings.
I won't begin the next round of spelling fixes until 2.7.40, for those
who want to plan ahead that far.  And next time, I'll send the patches
through the maintainers. But we can still argue about spelling fixes if
that makes people happier.
Cheers,
Steven (off-duty spelling cop)
