I was experimenting with tc rules on a 2.6.8.1 kernel, adding and
deleting rules on eth0 while traffic was flowing.
After perhaps twenty iterations when I entered this command the
machine hung.  SysRq-b rebooted it.
  sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root tbf rate 100kbit latency 50ms burst 1540
This kernel has been very solid in other respects on this machine.
