Hi,
I've been looking into a problem with my HP ScanJet 5300C not being 
detected by the USB stack, with a 2.6.20 kernel.
Bug #6078 was opened by someone else for this way back in Feb 2006, but 
then closed due to lack of user feedback in late August 2006.
I've added some comments to this as I've tested the patch, but I'm not 
sure if any current kernel developers are following this bug... should I 
open a new bug, as I can't change the status from REJECTED/INSUFFICIENT 
DATA?
I'm not on list, so a cc on replies would be greatly appreciated
Thanks,
Phil Lello
