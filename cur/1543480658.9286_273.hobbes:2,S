Hi,
the "real" patch-2.2.0-pre8 now removed sys_vfork on ix86 (but not
__NR_vfork in asm-i386/unistd.h).  Was this really intented and has
vfork now disappeared?  What's the situation on the other
architectures?  Should glibc revert to using fork instead of vfork or
is there a special way, e.g. with using CLONE_VFORK, to get vfork
back?
Thanks,
Andreas
