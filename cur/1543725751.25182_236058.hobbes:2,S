I'm not 5000 just one over-worked sysadmin.  We are using cryptoloop on
a handful of very key servers that 300+ remote offices transmit critical
data through.  I was aware of the weaknesses when I implemented but it
was the best available at the time.
Happy to migrate to dm-crypt when the userland tools are ready.
