Hi:
I have a trouble using cfdisk( linux kernel 2.2.10 on PC: PII ):
when all have been done and write partition information to hard disk, I get
the following message:
                    Wrote partition table success, but re-read failed,
reboot to update.
My hard disk  is:  Quantum Fireball Ex6.4A, 6149M w/418kB Cache,
CHS=784/255/63, (U)DMA
Partition : hda1( win95 fat32), hda2(ntfs), hda3(linux ext2), hda4(linux
swap).
Anybody can tell me whether my hard disk has problem or it is a software
problem?
and how to fix it?
Thanks .
