Yes, but if 
RLIMIT_NPROC is per user and RLIMIT_CPU is per proc
the theoretical CPU limit per user is RLIMIT_NPROC * RLIMIT_CPU. So if
you half the RLIMIT_NPROC you will half the theoretical maximum CPU
limit per user.
Same with memory.
I don't know if that really solves anything, but a misbehaving process
(fork bomb) would need to consume the double RAM or CPU to do the same
"damage" if RLIMIT_NPROC is halved.
