Nothing happens if you don't use -fcaller-saves or some other such
optimization(s). Even -fomit-frame-pointer is safe across called
functions so there should not be a problem mixing and matching.
Note that your 'C' runtime library was probably not created by your
current C Compiler and your user-mode C programs probably run just
fine.
Very old GNU C compilers followed the "M$" convention of prepending
an underscore on a global variable. Therefore "main:" became "_main:".
With such a compiler output, the linker will have trouble.
If you link together certain objects to make a module, you must
ascertain that the objects were produced using the same kernel
structures (read identical kernel version). As an example, the
main module structure, used by the kernel to find out where your
module's procedures are, is called: "struct file_operations".
The first structure member used to be a pointer to lseek(), now
it's an opaque object of type THIS_MODULE.
Imagine the fun if you made a module with this mixup!
Cheers,
