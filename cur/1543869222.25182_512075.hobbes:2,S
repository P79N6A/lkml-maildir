This architecture was brought to us by windows on our screens. And it
took years (a decade?) for them to use all hardware features:
     	      (IA-32, i386) --> (MS Windows NT,9X)
Yet you must still do much system programming to use that features.

transputers were (AFAIK) completely orthogonal to any today's x86 CPU
architecture -- hardware parallelism, special programming language and
technique to match this hardware. And they were chosen to work on Mars in
mid-90th, while crowd wanted more stupid windows on cheap CPUs.

Thus, i think, you are thinking mostly on hardware level, while it's
longstanding software problem, i.e. to use x86 (:.
