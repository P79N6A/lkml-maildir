The drive's buffers isn't good enough. If power is lost the write will be lost
and the database corrupt. It needs to be on the platters.

That doesn't agree with people's experience. People seem to find that SCSI
drives never cache writes. This sort of makes sense since there's just not
much reason to report a write success before the write can be performed.
There's no performance advantage as long as more requests can be queued up.

It's my understanding that it doesn't. There was some discussion in the past
month about making the drivers issue syncs for journalled filesystems, but
even then the idea of adding it to fsync or O_SYNC files wasn't the
motivation.

Only the third is of interest to Postgres or other databases. In fact, I
suspect only the third is of interest to other systems that are supposed to be
reliable like MTAs etc. I think Wietse and others would be shocked if they
were told fsync wasn't guaranteed to have waited until the writes had actually
hit the media.
