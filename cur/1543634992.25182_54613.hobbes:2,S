Just a slowdown, but in some cases it could be a quadratic slowdown
that could conceivably be turned into a denial of service.  As risks
go, it's a minor one, but there's a straightforward solution with
insignificant cost in either efficiency or code size, so why not do
it.  The overhead is just a data move from the superblock per name 
hash.
