So this seems to be about the minimal patch; it just makes the kernel
honor the RLIM_INFINITY value as "unlimited" rather than 2GB-1.
It seems to work.  Certainly it is not as good as having a bigger word
or using a larger unit than 1 byte, but neither of those seem like
very palatable alternatives.
