You can't build an object only built from an assembler file. 
But you don't want to get two modules, you want one module built from 
two source files.
IOW, you want:
  obj-$(CONFIG_FB_BFIN_7171)	+= bfin_ad7171fb.o
  bfin_ad7171fb-objs		:= bfin_ad7171fb_main.o rgb2ycbcr.o
Note that this requires renaming bfin_ad7171fb.c to bfin_ad7171fb_main.c.
