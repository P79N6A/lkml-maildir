I do cross-compiles for some architectures but not all. None of the
nommu architectures are covered (I should change that). I actually did
cross compile m68knommu for the first versions of the patch, that didn't
went to well because of the standard m68k compiler. The pte_fn_t change
has been added after the test compile for m68knommu. This is how is
slipped through my fingers. The problem wasn't noticed either while the
patch has been aging in Andrews -mm tree.
