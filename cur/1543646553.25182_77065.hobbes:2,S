The workaround is to force BIO's to be no bigger than a page.
That limits performance, but it should still be somewhat better
than the pre-bio times.
This used to be fixable in mpage.c, where a comment
explained what to to in precense of "braindead drivers"
But mpage.c changed sometime between 2.5.36 and 2.5.39.
Now the new include/linux/bio.h has the following:
#define BIO_MAX_PAGES           (256)
I tried substituting (1) for (256), but it didn't help.
So I don't mount raid-0 right now.
