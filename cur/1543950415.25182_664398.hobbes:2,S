I know.  That completely misses the point I just made:
   As I said then, one of my concerns was with the low-level tweaks not yet
   sufficiently baked, independent from my reservations about the ptrace
   feature.  Your #if'ing out of the user ABI additions for 2.6.25 does
   nothing to remove the unknown new risks from all the tweaks with fingers in
   the low-level arch stuff.  This is the sort of thing I was concerned about.
You didn't revert the parts that ever could have caused problems for anyone
except those using the new ptrace extensions, i.e. changes to step.c,
context switch, whatever else was touched we've lost track of now.  I keep
saying that those are not baked, 100% independent of the ptrace feature.  
You don't seem to be hearing me.
Thanks,
Roland
