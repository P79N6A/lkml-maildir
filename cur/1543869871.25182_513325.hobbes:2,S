Not a bad idea, but it could use some extra error checking to make  
sure that somebody remembers to "#define __kstruct_foo" before  
"#include <linux/foo.h>" (perhaps indirectly through linux/bar.h).   
Maybe something like this (plays nice with the very-basic unifdef  
parsing too):
#ifdef __KERNEL__
# define __kstruct_stat stat
# define __kstruct_foo foo
# define __kstruct_bar bar
#endif
#ifdef __LINUX_KERNEL_EXPORT
# define __kstruct_stat stat
# define __kstruct_foo foo
# define __kstruct_bar bar
#endif
#ifndef __kstruct_stat
# error "Missing definition of __kstruct_stat, please insert:"
# error "  #define __kstruct_stat <name-for-stat-struct>"
# error "into your C file before '#include <linux/foo.h>'"
#endif
struct __kstruct_stat {
}
Someone who wanted to keep the name __kstruct_stat could of course  
"#define __kstruct_stat __kstruct_stat" easily.
Cheers,
