I disagree. I did the exact same thing on AVR32 because !EMBEDDED
forces on tons of crap that just isn't useful on many embedded
platforms. I trust our users to actually enable for example virtual
terminal support if they happen to need it. Far from everyone do, and
it's going to end up as dead code unless they also enable the right
framebuffer driver.
