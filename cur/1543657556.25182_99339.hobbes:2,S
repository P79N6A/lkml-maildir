Well, you see, when I wrote "long-time tradition" above, I actually
meant "I've never seen it work differently and it's been *some* years,"
so I don't want to just go ahead, as I can imagine there might be
people with very valid reasons for why this should not be done.
One convenient aspect of this idea is that "make oldconfig" would still
work because most of the subsystems already have their main on/off switch
the config keyword of which wouldn't change -- it would merely be moved.
