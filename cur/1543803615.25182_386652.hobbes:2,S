Hi Linus.
Please pull latest kbuild fixes from:
	ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/kbuild.git
	Soon to be mirrored out at:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/kbuild.git
It contains four bugfixes to kbuild/kconfig:
Sam Ravnborg:
      kconfig: get rid of stray a.o, support ncursesw
      kbuild: fix make -jN with multiple targets with O=...
      kbuild: create .kernelrelease at *config step
      kbuild: fix 'make all install_modules install'
The commit named "kconfig: get rid of stray a.o, support ncursesw"
introduces support for ncursesw so a small feature enhancement was
sneaking in too. ncursesw giver nicer looking graphichs on text-only
usgae (if available).
	Sam

commit df9df036d356078679a60135fba65f79cd6153d0

    kbuild: fix 'make all install_modules install'
    
    The command 'make all modules_install install' would fail
    in a virgin tree - pointing at a non-existing directory under
    /lib/modules/xxx
    
    KERNELRELEASE is part of MODLIB and we need to create .kernelrelease
    before we can properly evaluate KERNELRELEASE,
    Changing MODLIB to the recursively expanded flavor let it pick up
    the correct KERNELRELEASE value.

commit 2244cbd8a9185c197ec5ba5de175aec288697223

    kbuild: create .kernelrelease at *config step
    
    To enable 'make kernelrelease' earlier now create .kernelrelease when
    one of the *config targets are used.
    Also introduce KERNELVERSION - only user is kconfig.
    KERNELVERSION was needed to display kernel version in menuconfig -
    KERNELRELEASE is not valid until configuration has completed.
    kconfig files modified to use KERNELVERSION.

    kbuild: fix make -jN with multiple targets with O=...
    
    The way multiple targets was handled with make O=...
    broke because for each high-level target make spawned
    a parallel make resulting in a broken build.

    kconfig: get rid of stray a.o, support ncursesw
    
    scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-lxdialog.sh uses gcc to check for
    what libraries are present. Redirect output to /dev/null
    so we do not generate an a.out.
    Also included support for ncursesw - so if present prefer that
    instead of ncurses.
    The order is now (first is preferred):
    1) ncursesw
    2) ncurses
    3) curses
    
    The latter is to support SunOS.
