Please - lets check first if the free list is actually a problem, before 
deciding to kill it.
If you remove the free list, it becomes impossible to find the freeable 
slab, if another (partial) slab is added to the partial list afterwards.
And I'm definitively against locking up one slab in each cache - it 
coudl be a order=5 allocation. It would be possible to hack around that 
(if alloc is high-order, then partial slabs do not exist), but that's 
too ugly to think about.
