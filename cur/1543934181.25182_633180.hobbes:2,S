Most of the chipsets let you turn it on and off so presumably the BIOS
turns it off before running Linux. Thats certainly done by several
chipsets and we recently had a bug where a BIOS forgot to turn them off
which confused someones parallel port devices.

I'm not aware of such, or requests for them.
