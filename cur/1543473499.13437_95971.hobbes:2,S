No, it's a good idea!
It is unclear whether kernels produced with -m486 by the old gcc-2723
are faster on Pentiums and K6s and PentiumIIs than -m386. One of the pgcc
developers (M. Lehmann?) pointed that out some time ago, that the -m486
-malign-functions=2 ... is not very useful.
I'd guess, the K6, e.g., is faster with -m386 than with -m486, but best with
-mpentiumpro if available ... (I did some test with a numerical application
some time ago with egcs-2.91.5x, so it's not entirely guessed, but the
kernel is quite different from my numerical C++ code.)
