Just because you use 32 or 4 or 8 or whatever tags you cannot know the
number of commands still in the drive's cache.  Have you disabled
turned off the WCE bit on your drive and retested your latency numbers?

But it does matter.  If single process can fill the drive's or array's
cache with silly write data as well as have all outstanding tags busy
on its writes, you will incur a significant delay.  No single process
should be allowed to do that.  It doesn't matter that the read becomes
the most important thing on earth to the OS, you can't take back what
you've already issued to the device.  Sorry.  It doesn't work that
way.

Under what benchmarks?  http load?  Squid, News, or mail simulations?
All I've seen are examples crafted to prove your point that I don't
think mirror real world workloads.

These are very differnet than the "benchmark" I've seen used in this
dicussion:
dd if=/dev/zero of=somefile bs=1M &
cat somefile.
Have you actually timed some of your common activities (say a full
build of the Linux kernel w/modules) at different tag depths, with
or without write caching enabled, etc?

Take a look inside True64 (I believe there are a few papers about this)
to see how to use command response times to modulate device workload.
FreeBSD has several algorithms in its VM to prevent a single process
from holding onto too many dirty buffers.  FreeBSD, Solaris, True64,
even WindowsNT have effective algorithms for sanely retiring dirty
buffers without saturating the system.  All of these algorithms have
been discussed at length in conference papers.  You just need to go
do a google search.  None of these issues are new and the solutions
are not novel.

You are trying to solve these problems at the wrong level.
