Depending on how data fields are arranged by linker, the patches could
save or waste per_cpu size. Below is data I got.
Case 1: On linux-2.6.21-rc7-mm2 with defconfig build.
Case 2: On linux-2.6.21-rc7-mm2 plus the patches in this thread with
defconfig build.
Case 3: On linux-2.6.21-rc7-mm2 with defconfig with VSMP=y build.
Case 4: On linux-2.6.21-rc7-mm2 plus the patches in this thread with
defconfig with VSMP=y build.
Please note that on x86/x86-64, per_cpu_init_tss is placed in the first
place in per_cpu section in Case 1 and 3. And thus there is no padding
waste for per_cpu_init_tss in Case 1 and 3.
On X86:
Case 1: Size of per_cpu section is: 0x7768
Case 2: Size of per_cpu section is: 0x790c
The patches waste 0x1a4 bytes.
per_cpu__init_tss, per_cpu__irq_stat, and per_cpu__runqueues are moved
to shared_cacheline_aligned section.
On X86-64:
Case 1: Size of per_cpu section is: 0x72d0
Case 2: Size of per_cpu section is: 0x6540
The patches save 0xd90 bytes.
Case 3: Size of per_cpu section is: 0x72d0
Case 4: Size of per_cpu section is: 0x8340
The patches waste 0x1070 bytes. 
Shall we not use shared_cacheline_aligned section for VSMP case? The
waste of cache eventually may offset the potential gain of alignment.
Probably need to set up a cache line size threshold: if L1 cache line
size is bigger than a number CACHELINE_ALIGN_SHRESHOLD, don't do
cacheline alignment.
per_cpu__init_tss and per_cpu__runqueues are moved to
shared_cacheline_aligned section.
On ia64:
Case 1: Size of per_cpu section is: 0x8370
Case 2: Size of per_cpu section is: 0x7fc0
The patches save 0x3b0 bytes.
per_cpu_ipi_operation and per_cpu_runqueues are moved to
shared_cacheline_aligned section
