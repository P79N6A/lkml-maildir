How do you know if the sections are "simply mapped"?  The module loader
could assign different sections to different mappings, there is no
guarantee that they are contiguous.  They were contiguous using the 2.4
module loader but only because the syscall only allowed for a single
area.  The new loader can assign sections anywhere it likes.
One possibility the new loader opens up is the ability to replicate the
pure module data (rodata and text) for each node of a NUMA box.  There
is already an option to replicate the kernel text on each node to cut
down inter-node traffic.  Replicating the pure module data would be
nice as well.  I guarantee that will result in something that is not
"simply mapped".
