I think so.  So we'd end up with:
- DEFINE_PER_CPU and kmalloc_percpu() work in core kernel, and use the 32k
  pool.
- DEFINE_PER_CPU in modules uses the 32k pool as well (core kernel does the
  allocation).
- kmalloc_per_cpu() is unavailble to modules (it ain't exported).
AFAICT the only thing which will break is sctp, which needs a trivial
conversion to DEFINE_PER_CPU.
