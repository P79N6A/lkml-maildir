Nothing in kernel-parameters.txt says there will be almost no activity
on them. What you see is what you get, AFAIKS. It would seem strange
to me if isolating one CPU in a 2 CPU machine behaved differently from
isolating the other.
Isolating is really in the context of isolating it from scheduler
balancing, rather than suggesting no tasks will run on there. One way
you could make this do what you want is to bind the init process to
your non-isolated-CPU at boot. This is a policy decision that can be
done in userspace though.
