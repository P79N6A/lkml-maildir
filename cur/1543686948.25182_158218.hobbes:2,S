Sigh.  Yes, I was thinking of the case where x and y already have
maximum entropy, in which case
entropy(x) >= entropy(x xor y)
For any y.  The point I was really trying to make (badly) is that
xoring won't increase entropy on average in this particular case
(folding the output of SHA-1).  In other words, xoring won't make
anything better, and has the possibility of making things worse.  In
any way I evaluate it, folding and truncating are just as good for
this particular case, except that folding costs more
computationally. (The computational cost was significant enough to
have a measurable effect on throughput, so I'm not arm-chair
optimizing here.)
I sacrifice any earlier points I attempted to make on the altar of
hasty mathematics.
