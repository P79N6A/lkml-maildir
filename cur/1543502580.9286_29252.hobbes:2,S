following bug-report is in "/usr/src/linux/REPORTING-BUGS" format.
[1.]
i occasionaly get "unable to handle kernel paging request" kernel error.
[2.]
i occasionaly (about once in 1 or 2 months) get "unable to handle kernel
paging request at virtual address XXXXXXXX" kernel error. it is always
related to "current->tss.cr3" and i think it is present in all 2.2.X kernels
up to 2.2.10 (included) - full message (i hope it's reproduced acurately) -
message has been displayed at about 8:15pm.
after about 80 seconds another similar massege apears on console with
diferent 2nd line:
current->tss.cr3 = 0519b000, %cr3 = 0519b000
i did not catch other diferencies while about 4 minutes after second message
3rd such mesage has been displayed on console (i was taking notes on paper).
so i shutdowned machine - here are error messages while shutting down:
Unmounting NFS filesystems
umount: /mnt/net: device is busy
<...>
Unmounting filesystemsCannot MOUNTPROG RPC: RPC Port mapper failure - \
RPC: Unable to send
lockd_down: no lockd running
umount2: Device or resource busy
umount: /mnt/hda2: device is busy
here i have to note that my root filesystem is on /dev/sda2 and that
/mnt/hda2 is my second etx2fs partition.
ater booting machine up, following lines apears in dmesg (and
/var/log/messages):
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,2)): ext2_check_blocks_bitmap: Wrong free \
blocks count for group 3, stored = 5221, counted = 5220
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,2)): ext2_check_blocks_bitmap: Wrong free \
blocks count in super block, stored = 175253, counted = 175252

them), shutdown sequence and boot sequence [as attachemnt, gziped]
[8.]
i'm using RedHat i386 linux based on RedHat 6.0 RPMs mostly but with
significant number of packages rebuild by me using egcs-1.1.{1,2}. kernel is
compiled from common source files from ftp.kernel.org (not RedHat kernel).
NFS looks like affected but while at this last "incident" i'm using
knfsd-1.4-2 and knfsd-clients-1.4-2 (rebuild by me from RedHat SRPM),
previously i was using nfs-{server,server-clinets}-2.2.beta{37,44} but same
"unable to handle ..." error has occured with those versions of NFS too.
also X windows are slightly unstable (core dump) but i do not know whether
it is related.
