That vendor kernel that you're running has the rmap vm which has the kscand 
daemon. If you build a newer vanilla kernel it will not have the kscand 
daemon. Alternatively, you can manually nice the the kscand daemon as root 
to a lower value (not sure what it is by default) say nice +19. You can also 
rebuild your vendor's kernel and edit the code to set the nice level 
on spawning the daemon (obviously this requires more knowledge than the 
previous options).
Cheers,
Con
