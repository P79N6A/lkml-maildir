no, I didn't reject it.  I just said you should contribute your work
with the work of the other people, so we end up having one
conntrack-optimization patch.

It is an artificial case, in which you have a single client opening 
thousands of connections to a single port on a singles server.  Please 
correct me, if I misunderstood.

yes, this is the thing we should change right now.  All other
optimizations should be sorted out as a whole.

Would you be satisfied with making the default hashsize no longer a
power of two?

no, exactly the 'power-of-two' has been discussed as well.
