Sorry, maybe you don't understand my little trouble... 2.0.36 is working
fine... 2.1.xxx and 2.2.0pre1 was gettin' me crazy... but i did Alan's
recomendation (Don't say "m" to Unix sockets...), and worked now. But now,
all my modules have Unresolved symbols... Maybe 'cause i retain my old
2.0.36 and System.map?
This is part of my /boot dir:
lrwxrwxrwx     1 root   root     20 Dec 30 10:13 System.map ->
System.map-2.2.0pre1
-rw-r--r--     1 root   root  72940 Dec 14 15:54 System.map-2.0.36
-rw-r--r--     1 root   root 169267 Dec 30 10:10 System.map-2.2.0pre1
(snip)
-rw-r--r--     1 root   root 328483 Dec 14 15:54 zImage
-rw-r--r--     1 root   root 464338 Dec 30 10:11 zImage-2.2.0pre1
Thanks again in advance.
