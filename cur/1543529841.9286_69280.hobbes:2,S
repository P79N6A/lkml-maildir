i am having trouble with my tulip card.  it's a 21041 but the driver
sends it through a 21143 pathway.  i don't know if the 21041
is similar to the 21143 but it sure isn't working for me.
here's the relevant portion of the dmesg for linux-2.3.51
Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.4 (Feb 28, 2000)

      WTF??
i've got one card that works fine, but the second has trouble.  i have
the same problem with tulip 0.91g, 0.91x and 0.9.2 (part of 2.3.46).
tulip 0.91 (no letter) does work.  the venerable 0.89h works too.
however, it has a strange feature of repeating the media #0 10baseT line.
from linux-2.2.14

why the repeat?
btw i have had this problem for a while, but i haven't many other
posts about 21041 trouble.  one guy on the tulip list reported the
same problem with 0.91e.
is this because
1) everyone else's 21041 works just fine,
or
2) no one else has a 21041 tulip ethernet card?
if you've got a 21041, and it works with the new drivers, please email
me about it.  thanks.
