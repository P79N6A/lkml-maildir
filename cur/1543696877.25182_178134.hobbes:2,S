may i write in hex, i feel much unconfortable having 20bit numbers in
decimal?
9,0x00000 -> md0
...
9,0x000FF -> md255
9,0x00100 -> md0p1
9,0x00200 -> md0p2
...
one would expect it to be the other way around, but it is still fairly
intuitive, and it keeps uniformity.
Uniformity is important, because we can doo binary ops on the minor
number and get consistent results.
