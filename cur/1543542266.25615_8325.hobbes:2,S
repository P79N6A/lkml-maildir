You probably hit the forwarded port range with your local port numbers. By
default the local port range starts from 1024. Then ports 1025, 1026 etc are
used. Now, you use portforwarding for, say, ports 2000-2010. You redirect these
ports to your internal network.
Guess what happens when your local port numbers reach 2000?
No traffic goes out for this connection. And for the next 10 connections. When
the local port reaches 2011 everything starts working again.
I discovered this in 2.0.3x when using ipautofw.
Solution: set your local port range to be outside of the portforwarded ranges
and masq range (61000+).
