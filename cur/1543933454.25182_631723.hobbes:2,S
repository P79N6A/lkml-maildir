    PM code is generally broken and unmaintained, so no wonder. I don't 
remember if anyone has fixed CPU context restoration code (it uses a "skewed" 
stack frame).

    I've just looked into the Au1550 datasheet and indeed it doesn't have such 
register; its SDDRAM controller is not compatible with older SoCs.

    Looks like you'll have to invent something... ;-)
