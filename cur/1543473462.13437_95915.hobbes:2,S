Hello,
Just wanted to update everyone on what exactly my SMTP problems were, and how
they were "resolved". I had switched to the school's new high speed dial-up,
and was connecting v.90/46k. Unfortunatley some MTU weirdness seemed to occur
only with SMTP, preventing me from sendin anything but tiny messages. I
"fixed" this by changing back to the standard v.34/33.6k dial-up, and all was
well.
I don't know if anyone can explain WHY this switch would occur SMTP to barf,
but I'm all ears. Reply off-list if you think it's off-topic.
I'd like those 4.6kbps (vs. 3.4kpbs) download rates back!
Thanks,
m.
