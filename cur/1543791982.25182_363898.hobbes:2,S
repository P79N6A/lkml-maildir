Subject: [PATCH] MMC: Prevent MMC block driver from trying to access password-locked cards
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
We are working on adding support for password-locked MMC cards on
Linux, using the Kernel Key Retention Service for password management.
This is the first patch we will be sending to add such support. Any
comments/suggestions are welcome.
The patch itself:
Prevent the MMC block driver from trying to access password-locked MMC cards.
