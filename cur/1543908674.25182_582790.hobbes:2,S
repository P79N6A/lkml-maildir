I have a concern; you seem to be patching potentially "live" code....
there are basically two options
1) you run the risk of triple faulting (patching an instruction while
some other core/cpu may be decoding it may cause a triple fault)
2) you do an IPI to all other cpus and prevent them from executing any
code except a small loop during the patching... this is expensive.
To be honest, neither sound very attractive to me ;(
