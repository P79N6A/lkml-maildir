Well, *right now* you don't have hostile users.  However, that can change, if a
user's password gets compromised (often because they left it on a stick-it note
on the monitor), or if somebody is running Firefox and accidentally hits a
malicious site that exploits a Firefox bug, or if one of your company's
employees didn't get the raise they wanted, so they're quitting and planning to
kill the system on their way out the door....
