Actually, technically possible.  We heard from some application people
that Sun/Solaris has this option.  Good if the application is the only
one using the filesystem.  Supposedly there were large apps which used
lots of filesystems more or less exclusively and this option made people
happy.
Although before Linus says it, I guess crack makes people happy, too.  ;)
