From PCI's own context, it's perfectly right since this way encapsulate
access method to the object(pci, pci-express, ...) ala we're in that object
context.
But with the same object concept, mandating pci_bus struct for any pci
config access seems cruel, because others could be affected on changes in
pci objects as we are seeing between 2.4 and 2.5.
Tome, pci config access is simply about PCI/PCI-Express specs, and hence
access should be made with just what it takes - seg, bus, dev, ..., w/o any
implementation dependencies.

Right. It becomes just a matter of unifying APIs if other architecture have
own low level bare pci config access functions.
