[NEIGH] Fix add_timer race in neigh_add_timer
neigh_add_timer cannot use add_timer unconditionally.  The reason is that
by the time it has obtained the write lock someone else (e.g., neigh_update)
could have already added a new timer.
So it should only use mod_timer and deal with its return value accordingly.
This bug would have led to rare neighbour cache entry leaks.
