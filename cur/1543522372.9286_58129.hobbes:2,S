Looks like this option fits ORBS exactly:
- does not go search the net automatically, but only
  searches sites that were submitted by people
- no more than one (12-message) test a month, properly
  configured servers won't let them through anyway
- the admin of a not properly configured server is
  warned and given 30 days to fix the problem
- the open relay is kept secret during those 30 days
  so that it is still able to exchange email with the
  rest of the world and spammers cannot make use of
  the database to find open relays
- does not force anyone to use its database, mail admins
  wanting to use ORBS will have to configure their server
  themselves
I like it...
