I personally think that a standard scheduler/cpu is the way to go for SMP.
I saw the one IBM guys did and I think that the wrong catch there is trying
always to grab the best task to run over all CPUs.
I think that this concept could be relaxed introducing less chains between each
CPU scheduler.
A cheap load balancer should run, "time to time"(tm), to move tasks when a
certain level of unbalancing has been reached.
This will give each scheduler more independence and will make it more scalable,
IMVHO.

We've, somehow, understood it :)
