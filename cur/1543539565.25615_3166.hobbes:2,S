I made a quick hack on my patch to suport 2.2.16 kernel.
(Because I could not start DP264 with 2.4.0-test4 even without 
the patch.)
It is just coded and I am not examin the detail of the
2.2.16 kernel, but it seems to work quite well.
(Yes I use the patched kernel now with X and nfsroot)
The performance of the patch is as same as against 2.4.0-test4.
The patch is on the my WEB.
