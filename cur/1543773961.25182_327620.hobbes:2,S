I found this error on a 2.4.26 kernel:

between these lines there were other saying
>fetchnews[958]: reading XOVER info from /var/spool/news/...
Then I could shut the machine correctly down. No other process than
fetchnews had been killed
Aftere many searches on the net I still don't understand a thing about
this error: how much is it critical?
I mean: is it simply a situation of excessive memory requests that is
fixed by killing one or more processes (and the kernel is still alive
as before) or the kernel is in some way locked up (in particular: is
it necessary/better to reboot? Is there some risk of filesystem
corruption?).
