           Summary: file corruption using cryptoloop on ext2/ext3/other file
                    systems
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test2
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: axboe@suse.de
         Submitter: kernel@gozer.org
Distribution: unstable debian (util-linux 2.12)
Hardware Environment: AMD K7
Software Environment:
Problem Description:
Using cryptoloop, any files copied to ext2/ext3, and from what I hear anything
other than msdos/vfat (vfat verified), leaves files corrupted.
# this talks about files larger than system memory, but I see this with files
# of any size.

Steps to reproduce:
losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/hdX -e aes
mkfs -t ext3 /dev/loop0
mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
cp /tmp/some.mp3 /mnt
umount /mnt
losetup -d /dev/loop0
md5sum /tmp/some.mp3
losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/hdX -e aes
mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
md5sum /mnt/some.mp3
While the fs is mounted, everything checks out ok, but as soon as you unmount
and remount, it's all messed up.
I created a 10MB test file, and instead of using a drive/partition as above, I
used the file. ext2 on there worked ok, so I don't know if it's something over a
certain size or what.
