This is MOSTLY true, but not entirely.  As I recall, Alpha has two 
addressing modes: Sparse and Dense.
The mode you're referring to is dense addressing where 32-bit and 64-bit 
accesses are atomic, but 16 and 8 bit accesses require RMW.
Sparse mode allows for atomic 8 and 16 bit accesses, but the access size 
is specified in the address using a rather bizarre binary encoding that 
doesn't look much like a regular address value.  You would probably not 
want to use this unless you absolutely HAD to use some I/O device that 
required atomic byte or word accesses.
I'm sure someone else will (or already has) pipe(d) in with a more 
accurate explanation.  :)
