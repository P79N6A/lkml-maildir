Jack already posted results: the nice levels are massively inferior as
they currently stand.
The wrapper is incredibly inconvenient for applications: when you use
JACK, start clients would require a different command depending on
whether JACK is using RT mode or not. That is extremely inelegant, and
its why we've developed these solutions (caps+jackstart for 2.4,
"realtime" LSM for 2.6).
