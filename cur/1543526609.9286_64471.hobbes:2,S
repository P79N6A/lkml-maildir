The RTC driver doesn't make much sense without interrupts...  look at
the API in include/linux/rtc.h.  Without interrupts, you are just
querying the RTC status, which (I am guessing) is different on the
M58T35.
So, with no interrupts and a different status byte output, it sounds
like a completely new chrdev driver to me... :)
BTW, Andrea, since I think (???) this was your patch, why do you disable
RTC interrupt on Alpha platform?  You might as well disable the entire
driver at that point IMHO...
