Yow, I didn't mean to cause such an upset. ;)
Currently, the dri cvs snapshot for 20040905 doesn't compile with
2.6.8.1 for me (I've sent
a bug report to the dri-devel mailing list about this) so Lee and
Michel, you'll have to wait
until tomorrow (or maybe even the day after that) to see how the test goes.
I'm hoping it does work, this bug is pretty nasty imho. Who knew Quake
could take an entire box out in under 10 seconds. ;)
