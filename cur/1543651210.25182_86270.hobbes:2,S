From my patch, about the speed:
for PIII/4 CPU -> no change. using the same 2.5.45 copy.
for old i386 -> more optimal.
for Athlon -> 2.5.45 does not use unrolled copy for it either.
I am away for a while but I grew up in Japan and just wanted to save
some rooms for a embedded system like below.

The phisical size(not kernel) is about 5cm*5cm.
Is your copy function suitable in this case?
