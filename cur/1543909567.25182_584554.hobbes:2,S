Well, it serves a different purpose: While your ACCESS_ONCE() macro is
an lvalue, the order() macro is a statement that can be used in place
of the barrier() macro. order() is the most lightweight barrier as it
only enforces ordering on a single variable in the compiler, but does
not have any side-effects visible to other threads, like the cache
line access in ACCESS_ONCE has.
