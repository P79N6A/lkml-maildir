Hi All-
     I recently compiled my new Linux 2.2.2 kernel with module support
enabled. It compiled withouth any errors, but when I boot up and try to
install a module such as "lp" it says "kernel version needed, but not found"
And when i run modprobe -a, it says there are unresolved symbols in module...
If anyone has any ideas as to why this is happening, please let me know by
responding to this address, because Im not on the list.
