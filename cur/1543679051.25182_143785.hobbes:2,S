I'm sure bugz could be set up to send a report to netdev everytime
a bug was entered.  And, we would also have a good record of bugs
that people could search.  It would also keep bugs from falling through
the cracks:  If 'everyone' is responsible, that can often mean that
no one takes responsibility.
