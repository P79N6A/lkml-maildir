Yes.  kobject_uevent is what I was thinking of.
Even if it means it makes sense to add a few more types to handle
the situation at first glance it seems to fit well.
I know if I was looking for a notification that a something was added
or removed from a raid array I would look at the generic hotplug
events first.
Possibly KOBJ_CHANGE isn't the proper fit, possibly you have something
that is sufficient unique that it needs it's own enumeration type.
If so we can fix the generic code.
At the moment though KOBJ_CHANGE does seem to describe what you are
doing and the event data you have don't look like they are actually a
problem to fit into a user space environment.
As for worry about kmallocs do these events happen often?  I would
not expect any of them in the normal course of operation for a system.
Worst case you handle extra kmallocs with a library function.
It's not like you are using GFP_ATOMIC.
Plus there are other little bonuses if these events are reported
with kobject_uevent such as an already existing user space tools
to look at them and do something, and a scripting infrastructure
to take action when things happen.

I know sending some of the context with an event is important so
that you can filter out events you don't need.  Is the lack of context
actually a problem today?

Gratuitous in the sense that if we already have a mechanism for performing a
function we should not invent a new mechanism for doing that same function
for each different subsystem.
The fewer unique types of user interfaces we have the easier it to
maintain the kernel, the easier it is to write programs that work
with several kernel subsystems, and the easier it is for other
developers to understand and use the kernel.
This of course assumes things are a good fit or the other pieces
can be made to be a good fit.  Currently I don't see the what makes
device mapper's events not fit the existing models, and I don't
see it in the description for this patch why we need to invent
something new.
