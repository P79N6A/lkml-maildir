Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Remove interrupt stack table usage from x86_64 kernel (v2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The interrupt stack table (IST) mechanism is the only thing preventing
kvm from deferring saving and reloading of some significant state.  It
is also somewhat complicated.
Remove it by switching the special exceptions to use the normal irqstack.
Changes from v1:
- rebase on tip/master
- as a step, consolidate stack switching into a single macro
Jeremy, Xen is also affected; please review.
Avi Kivity (4):
  x86: drop the use of the tss interrupt stack table (IST)
  x86: Consolidate irq stack switching to a single macro
  x86: Make interrupt stack switching atomic
  x86: Move NMI back to interrupt stack
