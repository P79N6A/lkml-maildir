My apologies.  As I recall your problem looked to be a race in an area
where I was redoing the concurrency control.  I intended to ask you to
retest when my new version came out.  Unfortunately the new version took
awhile, and by the time I sent it out I forgot to ask you about it.
I believe your problem should be fixed in recent versions.  If not, I'll
make another pass at it.
