Code simplification (don't need both versions). Simpler kernel configuration. 
Even smaller .config files ;-)
A useful byproduct is more reproducible crashes when the stack overruns (as
8KiB stands, it will crash the same, but only sometimes; probably even
more, as it really is 6KiB for process + IRQ, and with 4KiB they are 4KiB
each). Yes, more crashes is a feature, as it gets fixed faster.
