So __rounddown_pow_of_two(16) returns 8?

But (1UL << ilog2(16)) returns 16?
And, afiact, your __rounddown_pow_of_two() is basically equivalent to (1UL
<< ilog2(n)) anyway.  So a suitable (and less buggy) implementation might be
static inline unsigned long rounddown_pow_of_two(unsigned long n)
{
	return (n == 1) ? 0 : (1UL << ilog2(n));
}
But I'm not sure.  Please create a userspace test harness to test this
patch.
