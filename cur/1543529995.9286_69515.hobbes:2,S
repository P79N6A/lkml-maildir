Basically you'll need two things to take that code: way to find the ID of
".." _and_ way to get the name by ID. Both are trivial with ext2 directory
structure. What will they cost on reiserfs? Both are needed only when
knfsd gets an fhandle cache miss and currently done via lookup() and
readdir() (with funny filldir) from underlying filesystem. Which amounts
to heck of overhead. _Anything_ will be better than ->readdir() - count
the calls of filldir and you'll see.
