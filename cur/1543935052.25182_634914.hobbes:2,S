"A selects B" == "A depends on B, but please don't hide A when B is off
and silently switch B on when A is switched on".
config SCSI
	tristate "SCSI device support"
	depends on BLOCK
	select SCSI_DMA if HAS_DMA
So, SCSI doesn't actually need SCSI_DMA per se, but it apparently needs
it whenever HAS_DMA != n.

Sam, does kconfig recursively follow select statements and switch on
options which are select'ed by select'ed options?  I suppose it doesn't.
Maybe this would be better:
 config SCSI
 	tristate "SCSI device support"
 	depends on BLOCK
-	select SCSI_DMA if HAS_DMA
 config SCSI_DMA
 	bool
-	default n
+	default y if SCSI && HAS_DMA
