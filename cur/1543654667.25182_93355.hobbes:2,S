Don't really know about this.  Autofs just uses mount to mount the
filesystem, so whatever happens when you manually mount should also
happen when you automount.  What's "en"?  Is this the same mount command
line as automount execs?  What's in your auto.master?  Which module are
you using?

That's what I suspected was happening, but I wanted to be sure.
