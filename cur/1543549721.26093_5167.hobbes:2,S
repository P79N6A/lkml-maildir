yes i like this property very much because it unearths VM balancing bugs,
which plagued us for so long and are so hard to detect. But statistically
it's also possible that try_to_free_pages() frees a page and alloc_pages()
done on another CPU (or in IRQ context) 'steals' the page. This can
happen, because the VM right now guarantees no straight path from
deallocator to allocator. (and it's not necessery to guarantee it, given
the varying nature of allocation requests.)

Andrea, if you really mean this then you should not be let near the VM
balancing code :-)

a big 'except'. You dont need gigabit for that, to the contrary, if the
network is slow it's easier to overallocate within the kernel. Ask Alan
about how many D.O.S. attacks there are possible without implicit or
explicit bean counting.
