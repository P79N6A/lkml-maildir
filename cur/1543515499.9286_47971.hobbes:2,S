No, I don't: at aty128fb initialisation, I only got garbage on my screen and the
boot process hangs :-(
No problem with vesafb :-)

I have a Rage Fury (AGP) and an Xpert@Play (PCI) in my computer.
vesafb alone work for one card (I have no more tested since I added the PCI one).
If I try aty128fb (with and without atyfb) I only got garbage on my screen and the
boot process hangs :-(
But there could be some parameters to give to lilo to proper handle that?
Thanks you very much,
