OK, thanks.
So it sounds like either #upstream broke #promise-sata-pata, or simply a 
bug got introduced into the only-used-in-mm-trees version of sata_promise.c.
I will look into it, but since Promise PATA-on-SATA support is still 
highly experimental, I can't promise an immediate response.  This isn't 
something that is in 2.6.17-rc, or even something going into 2.6.18.
