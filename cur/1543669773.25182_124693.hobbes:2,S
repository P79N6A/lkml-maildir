I believe it is!
Anyone on the list checked it out?  Is it good?  Any benchmarks performed?
Do we want it?
If it doesn't introduce instability, then it could be a very good addition.
Perhaps at the beginning of the 2.7 phase?  If were to be in a develoment
kernel for its entire life, it would certainly get all the bugs worked out.
Does Linus have an opinion on it?
One of the things that makes me like Linux the best is that the contributors
really seem to push the envelope.  Of course, I don't know really how well
other OS's do in that regard, but I wouldn't be surprised if we were leaving
other OS's like Windows, Solaris, and MacOS in the dust with some of the
cool things being worked on like the O(1) scheduler, the anticipatory I/O
scheduler, etc.  Maybe others have such things.  <shrug>
Sorry about the rambling.
