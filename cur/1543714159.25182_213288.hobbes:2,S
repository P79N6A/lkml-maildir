Ok, maybe there's some misunderstanding due to copy-n-paste-mistakes I made in 
my former mail.
As I suppose my device drivers will not become part of the official kernel, I 
keep them with my project. My opinion now is to use one Makefile for both, 
2.2-2.4 and 2.6 kernels, and to keep this Makefile simple.
Maybe, I'm not the first one who tries this, or maybe others would find it 
useful - that's the reason why I want to discuss this topic here. (If I'm OT, 
please let me know).
Ok, to become more detailed, I repost my current solution (which seems to work 
for both, 2.4 and 2.6). My question here focusses on the beginning, where I 
distinguish the kernel versions by evaluating 'uname -r' and defining five 
symbols. Is there a more effective way to do it, or is there a danger to 
conflict with the symbol names I chose?
# Makefile
KERNELVERSION := $(shell uname -r)
KERNELBASE    := $(basename $(KERNELVERSION))
KERNELMINOR   := $(suffix $(KERNELBASE))
KERNELMAJOR   := $(basename $(KERNELBASE))
OLD_MODULES := $(strip $(foreach V, .0 .1 .2 .3 .4, $(shell [ "$(V)" = 
"$(KERNELMINOR)" ] && echo yes)))
ifeq ($(KERNELMAJOR),2)
ifeq ($(OLD_MODULES),yes)
#	old style here:
# ...
all:	# ...
clean:
#...
else #ifeq ($(OLD_MODULES),yes)
#	new style here:
ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
EXTRA_CFLAGS := -I/usr/include
obj-m         += <my_module>.o
<my_module>-objs = <my module object files>
else #ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
KDIR        := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
PWD         := $(shell pwd)
all:
	$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules
clean:
	rm -f *.o *.ko .*.cmd <my_module>.mod.c
endif #ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
endif #ifeq ($(OLD_MODULES),yes)
else #ifeq ($(KERNELMAJOR),2)
#	don't want to support 1.x
all:
	@echo kernel $(KERNELVERSION) not supported
endif #ifeq ($(KERNELMAJOR),2)
BTW: I get a warning:
*** Warning: Overriding SUBDIRS on the command line can cause
***          inconsistencies
(which I silently ignore...)
