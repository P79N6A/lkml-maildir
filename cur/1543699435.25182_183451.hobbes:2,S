Technically it's hotplug which assumes that all drivers are always to be
loaded. But you are right.
And even there, I'd say hotplug+udev has the advantage: being userland
scripts, they can be tweaked to meet your needs (like on-demand loading
only your floppy, in your case). Unlike devfs.
Mechanism, not policy, etc.
