You like to jump in the deep end, I see.
You might want to look at LINUX IP Stacks Commentary by Satchell and
Clifford (Coriolis).  It covers 2.0, but it might prove helpful anyway.
(Also look into the device driver book, kernelnewbies.org, and the
like...)
I'm not sure about a default allocation size... I'm not sure if there is
one.
But as for the reallocation in the upper layers, usually it doesn't.  (I
think there are some cases where it may have to, but we want to avoid it
when we can.)  From my knowledge of 2.2.x, you'll want to look at how
that is avoided by using skb_push(), skb_pull(), skb_trim(),
skb_reserve(), etc.
skb_copy() and skb_clone() may also be of interest.
HTH, and good luck!
