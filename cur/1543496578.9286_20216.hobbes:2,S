I was just grepping the 2.3.3 kernel for lock_kernel() and stumbled upon this
code:
in arch/sparc/kernel/sys_sunos.c:
asmlinkage int sunos_readv(unsigned long fd, const struct iovec * vector, long count)
{
	int ret;
	lock_kernel();
	ret = check_nonblock(sys_readv(fd,vector,count),fd);
	lock_kernel();
	return ret;
}
and in arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sunos32.c
asmlinkage int sunos_readv(u32 fd, u32 vector, s32 count)
{
	int ret;
	lock_kernel();
	ret = check_nonblock(sys32_readv(fd, vector, count), fd);
	lock_kernel();
	return ret;
}
Both of which look rather suspicious, so I thought I'd let ppl know.  I
don't really understand the locking code, but this certainly looks wrong.
