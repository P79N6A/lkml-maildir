Interrupts got disabled here because do_page_fault() is an
interrupt-disabling trap, yes?
The patch looks reasonable to me: a slight reduction in interrupt-off
latency when really weird things are happening.
The patch also breaks things, I think: if userspace is running with
interrupts disabled and tries to access kernel memory it will presently
whizz through the kernel without ever enabling interrupts.  With this
change, the kernel will now enable interrupts, which is presumably not what
the application wanted.
However it's surely already the case that most pagefaults will go and
enable interrupts on this process anyway, so no big loss there.  I'd expect
the kernel to spit piles of might_sleep() warnings when all this happens, so
maybe it just doesn't happen for some reason.
