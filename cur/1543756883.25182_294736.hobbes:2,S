The multiprocessor scheduling documentation looks pretty
accurate, at a quick glance. A few small things though:
I don't think you place enough emphasis on the per-CPU-ness
of the 2.6 scheduler. For most workloads, this probably
yields by far the biggest improvement over the 2.4 scheduler
on even small SMP systems, due to much less lock and cacheline
contention.
Secondly, 7.1.2 can probably be removed completely. We can
actually handle this type of SMT balancing correctly without
shared runqueues (and in an arguably nicer way).
