No. What you told us was nothing like that at all. What you told us was 
that you totally ignored the issue I brought up, namely that development 
happens, and that you have the choice of stagnating or accepting it.
You point to it as some "systemic problem", and I told you that it's a 
sign of fast development. Things change. You didn't listen, or understand.
If you want systemic problems, it is your kind of "bug report" that isn't 
anything like a bug report. Make a real report, don't whine. Push the 
_report_, not your inane agenda. Talk about *technology*, not about how 
you wish everything revolved around you and your wishes.
