Hello!
Using SuSE 6.0 (glibc), Kernel 2.2.0 I got a (reproducable) cold reboot
while doing a 'strace' on a Java-program, i.e. as if someone pressed the
reset button, as a normal user.
The same does not happen with 2.0.36.
The strace-binary is the one from SuSE, so it was compiled with 2.0.36.
Does this is this ominous 'ldd-bug'? Or do I need another strace (strace
-- version 3.1)?
Kurt

Let's get crackin'...                Step 3: Get outta my house!
