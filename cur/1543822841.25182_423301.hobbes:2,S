Reverting the commit breaks MMC/SD in a very real way, and the fix
is plainly correct and is actually the only possible fix that can be
applied.
It sounds to me like SCSI is relying on some buggy behaviour which is
specific to the way that the kernel works with the fix removed.  Maybe
thing is kfree'ing and then reallocating something which remained
registered somewhere when it shouldn't do?
