Thing is, MAP_PRIVATE isolates others from your changes, not you from
other changes.
A valid implementation could map the original file RO and only COW a
page on the first modification - and this is what I thought linux did.
Which means your MAP_POPULATE would do a writable get_user_pages() on it
(and I think that issue was once raised as a bug).
Now what you want is to basically snapshot a file. There is always space
overhead from doing that, that is, new changes need to go somewhere (or
conversely the old data needs to be kept around).
I guess you could do that by force populating MAP_SNAPSHOT mappings of
the same file on writeout to that file (when no such page already
exists), but before doing the writeout. But that sounds a little icky,
esp. as you force the space overhead (which is the full mmap in the
worst case) into memory.
Relying on filesystems to be able to keep the snapshot around, pushes
that overhead into the filesystem (which is typically much larger than
memory and thus the most suited place for this), which seems like a much
better solution.
Anyway, I think both solution are feasible for implementation, the trick
would be to convince 1) us that its a good idea and will not be yet
another unused 'feature' with significant complexity and 2) someone to
do it.
