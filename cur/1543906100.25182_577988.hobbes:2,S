Same here, so testing is a pain. I was more thinking about running a patched
version for a day or longer and see if it happened or not. For me it happened
irregularly, but definitely a few times a day.
(It might help if people report what they're using. So, for what it's worth, I'm
using a PS/2 keyboard with xorg 1.2.0 with the "keyboard" driver.)
