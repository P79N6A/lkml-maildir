In thinking about this from the aspect of what I do here, this makes 
quite a bit of sense.  In running 2.6.0-test3, with anticipatory 
scheduler, it appears the i/o intensive tasks are being pushed back 
in favor of interactivity, perhaps a bit too aggressively.  An amanda 
estimate phase, which turns tar loose on the drives, had to be 
advanced to a -10 niceness for the whole tree of processes amanda 
spawns before it began to impact the setiathome use as shown by the 
nice display in gkrellm.  Normally there is a period for maybe 20 
minutes before the tape drive fires up where the machine is virtually 
unusable due to gzip hogging things, like the cpu, during which time 
seti could just as easily be swapped out.  It remained at around 60%!
It did not hog/lag near as badly as usual, and the amanda run was over 
an hour longer than it would have been in 2.4.22-rc2.
It is my opinion that all this should have been at setiathomes 
expense, which is also rather cpu intensive, but it didn't seem to be 
without lots of forceing.  This is what the original concept of 
niceness was all about.  Or at least that was my impression.  From 
what it feels like here, it seems the i/o stuff is whats being 
choked, and choked pretty badly when using the anticipatory 
scheduler.
I've read rumors that a boottime option can switch it to somethng 
else, so what do I do to switch it from the anticipatory scheduler to 
whatever the alternate is?, so that I can get a feel for the other 
methods and results.
