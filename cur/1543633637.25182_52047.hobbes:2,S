Perhaps I might point out that we need a solution for 2.4.
We certainly could go for kmalloc. But given the sparc64 example,
it won't work. If you do it with alignment in your own buffer, you can
control which fields are accessed.
We'd need to export a worst case minimum size for kmalloc.
Ugly, very ugly. Tons of kmalloc( size>MIN_DMA ? size : MIN_DMA,...
But it seems that this would mean quite a painful change in many drivers.
Which alignment macros wouldn't mean. In fact in the common case
there'd be no code change at all.
So if we take stability as a guideline, the alignment macros win without
question.

Could you elaborate ? This sounds interesting.

So perhaps something could be done in time for 2.4.20 ?
