The removal of the perfectly sane get_module_symbol() and replacement with 
a less useful function which looks stuff up in a dynamic table instead of a 
static table built at link time is an example of this. Now I have horrible 
link order dependencies in code which was previously relatively clean. It 
sucks, and there was absolutely no reason for it.
The fact that it was done so late in 2.4-test without even a period of 
marking the original sane version as deprecated made it even worse.
Thinks... if I violently abuse inter_module_crap() will it suffer the same 
fate and can I replace it with get_module_symbol() again? :)
