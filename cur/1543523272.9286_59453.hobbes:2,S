That task is easier now that the docs for the RNG are public :)

Is it feasible to offer a compile-time option which simply replaces
/dev/random?  Or maybe have the RNG driver be an add-on, which is
triggered by a kernel timer to add data to the kernel entropy pool every
N ms.  I like the internal test, BTW.
Off to read the driver...
