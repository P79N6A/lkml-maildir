now tested both of them -- light is constantly on in both.
does the HDD LED always signals about hardware activity or it can just
be sticky and not reset properly?
is there libata-dev patch for 2.6.8 kernel which seems to be running
fine so I might just patch it to get SATA SMART?
Thank you in advance for the feedback
