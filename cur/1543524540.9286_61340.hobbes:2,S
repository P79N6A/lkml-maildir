Just tested now on 2.3.42 and strobe still reports any port I choose as
listening so getpeername is still broken IMHO. I see that tcp_connected
has been removed in 2.3.41 so I'm fishing for recommendations on what
the affected line should look like ... I've ignorantly toyed with
		if (sk->state != SS_CONNECTED) 
and 
		if (sk->state == SS_UNCONNECTED) 
but neither seem to have quite the right effect so I'd guess something
closer to the complexity of the original tcp_connected is required?
Thank you,
