Assuming that page idx and idx + 1 in a bio are contigious is a very bad
one, no one has ever made any such guarantees. Besides, if you kmap()
it, things change. The pages in a bio have nothing to do with each
other, they are usually just a consequence of how the page cache ended
up allocating. So completely random usually, once you get a little
fragmentation.
Are you sure you are reading that code correctly? Code making such
assumptions would be breaking pretty quickly.
