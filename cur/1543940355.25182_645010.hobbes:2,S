This is my last counter argument. Based on this I'll submit a new patch
that is less intrusive.

I hope we agree that by definition the success of documentation is 
measured by its ability to convey ideas. So the basic disagreement is 
"simple English" versus "some flavor of English".
"entertainment value" is there only to keep the person reading, but 
"complicated" sentences harm readability.

"Same exact C compiler" does not mean what you try to say.

Right, this argument can't continue without other people's perspectives.

Some people may feel there is nothing to prevent constant changes. This 
paragraph tries to assure it is not the case. Actually, the whole point 
of this documentation is to comfort others.
PS. Off topic: I think documentation is a very important topic for Linux 
systems in general (there is lot to be improved!). I wonder how many 
bugs in programs could be avoided by writing good man pages. For 
example, many people tend to get select() wrong, and I suspect it's 
partly because the man page is not as good as it could be. An example 
of good man page would Davide Libenzi's epoll that has an FAQ for common 
questions and an example of suggested usage. Good examples drive 
developers for solutions that are known to work in practice.
