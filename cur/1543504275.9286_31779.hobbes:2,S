Speaking of which, can someone tell me if the Alpha has different
endianness than the Intel processors? 
I wrote a driver that reportedly simply works on Alpha. So I've been
64-bit clean. The next question is if I was careful enough to also
make things endianness-clean. 
(In fact, I think there is a place where endianness matters, but it
didn't affect the Alpha... )
