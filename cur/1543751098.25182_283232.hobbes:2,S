fwiw, it seems that there were ~1200 downloads of 2.6.10-rc2-mm4 from
kernel.org.  Almost all via http - only 20 downloads appear in vsftpd.log,
which seems fishy.  The number of downloads via mirrors is unknown.
(randomly chosen) 2.6.10-rc3-bk2 had ~750 downloads from kernel.org, only
eight of them via ftp (?).
bottom line: the number of testers seems to be in the 1000-2000 range.
