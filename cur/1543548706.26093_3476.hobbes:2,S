I guess it boils down to that the plugging (run_task(&tq_disc)) is overloaded
in Linux. It does merging of requests which are the same anyways (=from the
same operation in upper layers) and merging of requests that are unrelated.
An intelligent device could want to use tq_disc only for merging bhs in 2.4 
(and ignore it in 2.5 with kiovecs), and decide when to do other merging 
itself. Currently it is controlled by upper layers only. That makes sense
for merging of related actions (which should have never been split anyways)
but not for unrelated actions. Merging of unrelated IOs should probably
be controlled by the low level.
I assume such a split would give Linux the advantages Jeff has seen in 
Netware.
