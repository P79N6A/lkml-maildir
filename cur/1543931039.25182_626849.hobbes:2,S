Badari found a problem running some tests and handed it off to me to
look at.  I didn't share it publicly.  Anyway, we were finding that
fastgup was taking the slow path almost all the time with huge pages.
The problem was that follow_hugetlb_page was failing to fault on a
non-writable page when it needed a writable one.  So we'd keep seeing a
non-writable page over and over.  This is fixed in 2.6.24-rc5.

I'll try to get someone to run a DB2 benchmark and see what it looks
like.
