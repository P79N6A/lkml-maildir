Well your patch certainly cleans things up in there and would be a good
thing to have as long as we can be sure that it doesn't break the
accounting in some subtle way.
Which implies that we need to see some additional accounting code, so we
can verify that the base accumulation infrastructure is doing the expected
thing.  As well as an ack from the interested parties.  Does anyone know
what's happening with all the new accounting initiatives?  I'm seeing no
activity at all.
