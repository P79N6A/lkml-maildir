FASTCALL is useless and should not make a difference. It enables
regparm on specific functions, but that should not make a difference
if it works or not.
For working -mregparm you will need asmlinkage on all
functions that interface with assembler code to disable regparms for them.
The only exception is system calls which have the arguments on the stack
too.
