Optional as in it doesn't need to be forced.

If there is a boundary between a RO area
and a RW area and you want to map it with 2MB pages then NX is required,
but RO is optional on the page and if you prefer TLB use minimalization
over debugging it is optional. Is it clear now? 
Note the behaviour for pageattr and thus DEBUG_RODATA / debugging
sitations where you don't care about your TLB this
does not change, this makes only a difference for the initial init_32
direct mapping setup.
