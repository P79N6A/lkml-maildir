the situation is simpler than that: there is a /known/ bug, and i marked 
the bugfix commit as 'good'. I never met such a multiple-bugs scenario 
before and forgot that git-bisect could easily pick a tree without this 
essential bugfix and would not be able to make a distinction between the 
two types of badness.
I'll try what i've described in the previous mail: mark all bisection 
points that do not include f3ccb06f as 'good' - thus 'merging' the 
known-bad area with the first known-good commit, and thus eliminating it 
from the bisection space.
(but it might also be useful to have a "git-bisect must-include" kind of 
command that would allow this to be automated: mark a particular tree as 
an essential component of the search space.)
