It's reproducable... I got the same thing with a slightly different configured
2.6.13.2-npe (no preemtion, no acpi, no apm) but beside that, I got other
very strange crashes (page table something thingys?) as well during a CRUX pkgmk
tool to build i.e. samba. So I wasn't able to get the system stable enough for
more serious testing yet.
I am about to grab the latest linus' git tree and try that...
This system was running for a long time with linux without any problems
in the past. But I had to change the hdd (old one was broken) and installed
a new (CRUX) system from scratch... I migrated to 2.6.13.2 and switched over
to udev... I was running memtest86 for about half a day. It didn't show any
problems. Are there good torture tests to check if a system's hw is stable?
Thanks,
