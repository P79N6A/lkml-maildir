I've posted a list of questions Victor following what you said:
"People who have actual questions should feel free to ask me
directly - publically or privately, I don't mind."
Since many of the others who share my concerns would like to see
these questions answered, I think it would be a very positive
step if you would take the time to answer them.
Thank you,
Karim
