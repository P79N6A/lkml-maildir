Machines with heterogenous parport hardware are pretty much an oddball case.  
People who care about their ordering should probably use modules or invent a 
command line option to enforce it in any case.  For the 99.9% (maybe even 100% 
at the moment) of users with only one type of hardware it's no big deal.
