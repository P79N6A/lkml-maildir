I agree with this, but the argument against
that approach was that then you can only
enlarge the backing-store, but never shrink.
I personally think it is a valid argument,
even though the problem is probably not very
important.
Also, you can't expand the SysV SHM with mremap
just as well - it will give you a SIGBUS too IIRC.
So for that discussion of 2004, I lost the
battle and was convinced that the proposed
approach is not very good...

Have you tried the Posix SHM instead? It works
very well for me. Back in 2004 the glibc had
bugs, so I couldn't easily use posix shm and
was thinking about the different approaches.
But now it should suffice.
