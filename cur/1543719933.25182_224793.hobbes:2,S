Well.. Here is `cat /proc/pci`

Now lspci 'interprets' stuff. The interpretation may not be correct.
For instance, you think that your device wants 64 Megabytes. This is,
like, unheard of except for screen controllers and they are basically
broken because 64 megabytes can't be accessed at any one time. Large
allocations should be paged, but a page register costs a nickel
in the FPGA so vendors being cheap, cheap, grab a lot of your
address-space.
