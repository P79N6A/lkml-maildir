When the duplicatation was due to a typo, removing the duplicate is the
not the correct fix. Additionally, there are cases where the text
actually reads better (or no worse) with the duplication in place.

First "the" is actually a typo for "to".

Probably should be rephrased in general. Author probably intended it to
be parsed as "...but is quite important for, for example, mouse
movement...".

Again, "states that (that parameter)" while not great English is
probably exactly what the author intended.
