Ok, then, what about what the standard is saying regarding the ANSI
version field? Quoting to the latest MtFuji draft (Section 17.7.1):
 "The ANSI Version field shall contain a non-zero value to comply with 
  this version of the Specification for a SCSI logical unit or zero for
  an ATAPI logical unit."
and this is exactly how we see that the logical unit is a real SCSI one
or an ATAPI one.

We are not using the sr driver to perform our SCSI commands, as it is
filtering which CDB is allowed and which isn't. As we have some
vendor-specific SCSI commands (like the one for changing booktype), we
are using the sg driver to be able to use them.

Absolutly... but if the inquiry data buffer gets modified by the
midlayer, after that I am not able anymore to setup correctly the
commands for the _real_ interface. (once again, the blank command
example).
