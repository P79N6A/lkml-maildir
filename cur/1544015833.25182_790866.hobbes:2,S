Hello Jiri
I wonder what happend to
	
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/660978/
	
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/670165/
	
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/698016/
They date back to April and June 2008.  For the first two Jesper even
replied that he took them, but they did not appear in the branch that
Linus merged from you.
In November I sent another one, not to lkml though, "only" the arm list:

It's to early for it, but it would be fine if you could check that you
have this one, too.  At least it doesn't appear in your for-next branch.
(Assuming it's OK that I didn't adhere to the etiquette by not sending
it to lkml.)
Best regards and thanks,
Uwe
