This is why ATA 7200 RPM drives are based on HDA's that are SCSI2.
Now would you call a 7200 RPM SCSI2 drive junk?

Not all knowing or "the definitive answer" but will share what I do.

Some truth here......but you have determine your usage model.
Last check a few years back was each power-up or spinup from stop is about
10 hours of continious running.
So in an environment of 8-10-hour business days for 5 days per week.
Power on plus 10-hour day is about 20 hours.
20*5 << 7*24 or it costs you 68-78 hours of extra usage against the MTBF,
per week or 3/4 of a business week.
Remember that you have to float the heads and sticking can be an issue for
stopping. Also with accoustic management or spindle throttles you can
achieve different results.  The assumption above is that we are running at
max RPM always.
Best case is to place mount drives (regardless of type) in
anti-shock/vibration racks on an individual bases.  Even spindle sync will
generate beat-harmonics that moments of inertia frown upon.  Remeber that
75-100 G is easy to do with impulse.
