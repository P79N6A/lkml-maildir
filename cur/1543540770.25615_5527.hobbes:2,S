I have had similiar problems but with ne2000 pci cards.  The key 
seems to be three ethernet cards.  If I use two cards I didn't see 
the problem (but I only ran it for 10 minutes or so).  But with three
cards the system hangs when issuing an route request "route" or 
listing
the ipchain rules "ipchains -L"
When in this state, the box would masquarade out to the internet 
for the private machines correctly, but wouldn't respond to an 
external PING request, or allow a connection to SSH deamon.
taking one of the ethernet connections up and then back down 
tends to (but not always) correct the problem.
