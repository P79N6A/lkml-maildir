It could of course be that during the update something trashed some
part of the disk, which only made itself apparent after the reboot.
Golden rule: only change one thing at a time...
My alpha's been running 2.4.19-rc2 for more than 3 weeks now without any
problems (the kernel also has my patches against unaligned accesses in
the kernel, for the packet filter and for netfilter).  I don't think
anything big would have been changed between rc2 and the final release,
so unless it's specific to the IDE driver (I use SCSI) I doubt the
kernel is the culprit.
Of course, this isn't any comfort for you; sorry about your trashed
system...
