Basically its an arbitary cookie suitable only for passing to ioremap. In
practice its likely to be a bus address but not always since it may be a
combined ident (controller id<<lots|offset) or even a pointer to a struct
private to the platform
Currently I think everyone mainstrem except the pa-risc has either a bus
address or physical address in the registers. For pa the I/O port map used
to be (and might still be) a controller/offset pair.
