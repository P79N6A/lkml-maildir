Even the best memory controller cannot violate the laws of physics 
(electrons can at maximum travel with the speed of light). Therefore
cable lengths have a major influence on the latency of signals.

An efficient local reclaim should deal with that situation. zone_reclaim 
will free up portions of memory in order to stay on node.

The impact of spreading cached object will depend on the application and 
the NUMA latencies in the system.
