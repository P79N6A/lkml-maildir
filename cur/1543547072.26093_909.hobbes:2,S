FYI:
A few days ago somebody in a local list discovered the following message
in his syslog running 2.2.14 on a SMP machine:
kernel: eh? notify_parent with state 0?
It appears to me that tsk->state changed to TASK_RUNNING probably due to
a race. Although he did not observe any harmful impact on his system,
this might be the kind of bug you are talking about.
