Rummaging around in an nfs mount is bursty, and the nfs threads are part
of the burst.  No big deal, but I think it's illogical to differentiate.

That's a buglet then, because you can have sched_mc=2 and NEWIDLE off.

It used to help mysql+oltp low end throughput for one.  efbe027 seems to
have done away with that though (not that alone).

Yes. /proc/sys/kernel/sched_domain/cpuN/domainN/*

You're very welcome.
