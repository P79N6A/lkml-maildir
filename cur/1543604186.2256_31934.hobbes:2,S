	Hi,
	Somebody asked me if it was possible to monitor wireless
configuration change on 802.11 interfaces.
	Looking into the kernel, I noticed that RTnetlink was the
prefered way to export events related to interface changes. So, I
quickly hacked some RTnetlink Wireless Events, and it basically work
the way I want.
	Now, I've got some questions :
	o Have I done it the right way ? Is there anything I forgot ?
	o Is there a way to do a reverse of SIOCGIFINDEX ? If you have
an interface index, how do you get its name ?
	o Should I put the full interface name in the event ? That
would make events larger but help query the interface when receiving
the event.
	o Any other comments ?
	My plan is to continue experimenting with this patch a few
days and collect comments, and then do a new update of Wireless
Extensions with this patch.
	Regards,
	Jean
