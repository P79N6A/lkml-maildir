Sort of - the use of mod-perl is still available. The use of embeded
Java is also possible.
This section was aimed at static pages though. I'm still working on
data base support.

That depends on the purpose of the web site. It can be used as a
catalog lookup (mod-perl or java module in the apache web server). It can
also redirect the browser to another site for the busines applications.
It is also usable for any read-only type of data. Several sites use a
different server to recieve a post, process it, and have a staff member
accept the result, which is then fed back to the original server. If
(a big if) it is possible to use the embeded interpreters, then a checkout
list could be done by using hidden variables to contain the reference
list. This approach assumes that a limited size list is accepable (this
should be able to hold 10-20 items). When it comes time to checkout then
a pass to a different server would be used. All access to the data would
be via a cgi embeded in the server, the browsers history list shouldn't be
used. There may be some other restrictions I don't know about.
I am still exploring the use of MLS in web servers. In a MLS environment,
it is possible to grant write access to an unreadable link to provide a
connection to a separate database. The data base query may record data in
a location the server can read (but not write). This can help separate the
boundary between a penetrated web server, severly limit the amount of damage
(other than DoS). The piece that I haven't yet examined is the interface
between the server and database. There may not be a way to provably isolate
the data base process other than by obscurity - (randomly generate a domain
socket once per day - out of say 500? nah - to easy to try each one...).
