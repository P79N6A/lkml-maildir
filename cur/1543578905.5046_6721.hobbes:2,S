Careful, careful, careful.
The problem is that pre6 survives quite nicely, but because of the silly
typo in __mark_inode_dirty() it won't actually mark inodes dirty. 
Unless you are actually using the newly integrated raiser-fs, in which
case you should be just peachy ;)
Note that the bug is not even noticeable under many loads - especially
if you have lots of memory.  The inodes just get happily cached for a
long time.  Which is why I could release a pre6, not even noticing that
it's strange and not writing out inode data to the disk. 
With a gig of RAM, inodes tend to cache really well. 
Now, I'm not saying your filesystem is toast.  I'm just saying that if
you booted up in pre6, I'd suggest a quick reboot into a better kernel
might be a good idea (be a jock, and do a sync and just push the reset
button to force a proper fsck when it comes up - just in case).
(And yes, I renamed the pre6's really quickly, so you had to be unlucky
to see them.)
