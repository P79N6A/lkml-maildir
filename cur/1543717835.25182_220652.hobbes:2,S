So you already prepare for a capability bootparam.

Well it's just basic security issue.  The disable_cap_mlock has less
runtime risk because it's only exposing a single capability.  The ability
to mask off capability checks as boot/module load time (not compilation
time) is more flexible, and doesn't have to touch any extra code (which
gives the feel of cleaner hack), and is runtime safe (unless you care
a lot about setting up oracle, then re-enabling the CAP_IPC_LOCK checks
to minimized risk exposure).  You could give the module_param some 0644
access, but now uid == 0 or CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE could freely change the
mask during runtime.  So, to my thinking, you'd want to control with
sysctl that only allows bit clearing.

Question of audience...machine running oracle, or machine with users
that want safe gpg.  In fact, they probably aren't same machine, and I
bet in both cases a single group would work.  Well, anyway for gpg we
only want rlimits, and this work is already done...
