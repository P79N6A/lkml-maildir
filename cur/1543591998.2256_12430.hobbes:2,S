And what LFS wants too:
2.2.1.27 write() and writev()
DESCRIPTION
     For regular files, no data transfer will occur past the offset
     maximum established in the open file description associated with
     fildes.
ERRORS
     These functions will fail if:
     [EFBIG]
          The file is a regular file, nbyte is greater than 0 and the
          starting position is greater than or equal to the offset
          maximum established in the open file description associated
          with fildes.
     Note: This is an additional EFBIG error condition.
