When you say the kernel doesn't recognise all of the physical processors, 
do you mean it doesn't see them in the MPS/ACPI table, or that they fail to 
boot? Can you post your boot log?
I see you have a "us.ibm.com" email address ... is this machine an x440,
one of it's smaller brethren, or something totally different?
