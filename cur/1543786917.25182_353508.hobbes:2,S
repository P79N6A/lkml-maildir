I'm seeing a high number of files open, and there is no other reasonable 
cause other than threads in a single server operating. The code is 
complex, and I'm asking if the number of files "open" is somehow being 
counted as files open by the parent times number of threads. I'm getting 
some various error returns on file open which could be caused by that.
Just looking for an answer for both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, since this 
appears to be happening on both.
