Or fix drop_pagecache_sb():
        Repeat until all possible pages freed:
                grab and save some inodes to a buffer
                zip their pages outside of inode_lock
Takes much more code though.
I'd like to move this sysctl interface to the upcoming /proc/filecache. 
Being a module, it helps reduce the kernel size :)
