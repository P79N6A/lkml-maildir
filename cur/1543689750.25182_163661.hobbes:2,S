Subject: [PATCH] Move local_irq_enable() out of poll_idle()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Patch: irq_idle-2.6.0-test4-01jl
Scheduling is not allowed with interrupts disabled.  So we know that
when schedule() returns, local irqs are enabled.  So poll_idle() doesn't
need to enable them.
I suggest this change, to remove any confusion over whether the
individual idle routines need to disable irqs themselves.  (As seen
recently in a thread about mwait_idle):
        - remove the local_irq_enable() from poll_idle().
        - add local_irq_enable() at the start of cpu_idle(), before the loop.
