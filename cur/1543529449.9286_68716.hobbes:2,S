Soundblaster audio driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
sb_card: I/O, IRQ, and DMA are mandatory
This worked fine in 2.2.49 with the exact same configuration. Any ideas
how to make this work again?
Kernel is 2.2.51 fresh tarball (not patched .. I do this when I find an
error just to make sure it's not me screwing up patch)
Sound card driver is compiled in (not a module)
Any info needed can be provided on request.
