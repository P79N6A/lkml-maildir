Amen. I have even made material donations to the SS2 effort to give the
developer what he'd needed to fix an issue with a certain configuration
and will do so again if need be, as that expense would be minor compared
to the productivity (== billing) loss that arises from having to start
over from scratch from each of the 3+ times per day I have to shutdown
and physically relocate my machine from place-to-place or client-to-client.
