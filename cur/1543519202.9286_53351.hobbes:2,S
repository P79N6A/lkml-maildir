just lockups when running SMP kernel + IDE (6 25gb ibm's in raid0)
when running UP kernel, system runs ok.
see thread's about this (end sept. (IDE + SMP Lockup (no OOPS) in 2.2.12,
2.2.10)) and (SMP + RAID) and (end oct. How stable is ide + smp now ?)
when reporting these bugs the machine just crashes after few minutes.
this is now a few hours, but it still crashes
