Blame Creative.  They have released so many different cards under the
Live! name that it's become meaningless.  There are now two separate
classes of cards marketed as Live! (or Audigy) that don't even use the
same driver (ca0106 and emu10k1x), the hardware isn't even similar.
Unsurprisingly, the user confusion is massive.
The model number is the simplest unique identifier.  This is also what
the "good" Windows drivers for these devices,

,
use.
