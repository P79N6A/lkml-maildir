Could you make sure that you're not using 1A? (vanilla 1 and 1B are
both fine for these purposes).
Also, can I get a before/after of the following during an mp3 skip test?
vmstat 1 | tee -a vmstat.log
n=1; while true; do /usr/sbin/readprofile -n -m /boot/System.map-`uname -r` | sort -k 2,2 > profile.log.$n; n=$(( $n + 1 )); sleep 1; done
If you could stop the logging shortly after the skip in the kernel that
does skip (but not _too_ shortly after, give it at least 1 second) I
would be much obliged. The "before" picture is most important. An
"after" picture might also be helpful, but isn't strictly necessary.
Thanks.
