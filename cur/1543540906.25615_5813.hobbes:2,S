I knew that this question would come. So order the list of requested changes (the most
recent one at top, the oldest one at bottom). The background thread popps the orders
from the bottom, always hurrying to be in current state. The check (if the list is not
empty) has to work like going from top to bottom. (I say "has to work like", because you
can think if implementations where checking is implemented with a tree. If a match in
this tree is found, there should be tests wether the the inner entry (/dir/file) or the
outer entry (/dir) is newer.
For people imagining a DOS attack on filling the list: restrict the list size and make
all further attempt to add an entry block.

People (especially Windows users) tend to wait for one action to complete until starting
the next one. Imagine someone who wants to give rights to user "httpd" and then tries to
access his own web pages. Or imagine (at an ISP) a (virus|mp3|*) scanning tool which
should get access to 10000 customer homepages. Conventional acl changes would need hours
forcing the sysadmin to idle until he|she can start test-scanning on a wide range.
Yes, you can write scripts which sequentialize tasks, and yes, you can even attach a
script sequentially ( while test -e /proc/pid; do sleep 5; done;
do_something_after_the_process_died ). But those approaches are limited to command line
interfaces, sadly modern GUIs do not have capabilities to queue tasks into the future.

It should not be. Making the operation atomic is just a possible side effect. (Though
people might find applications for it.)
