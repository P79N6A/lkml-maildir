Oups, I had been mixing up named published works and anonymously
published works.
My previous claim is valid for anonymously published work only and
thus holds no relevance for the situation discussed. I apologize for
having raised a false claim.
The copyright for works with a known is valid for 70 years after
the authors death.
Sorry,
Michael
