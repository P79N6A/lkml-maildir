Indeed, but there are other known cases.
Some debug methods use register_console() to get their print routines
registered. If people forget to say e.g. `console=tty0' afterwards, the debug
console without the real device cannot be opened through /dev/console, and they
get a mysterious error. Usually /dev/console _is_ present in the root fs.
Perhaps a better fix is to modify the /dev/console demux code to fall back to
`/dev/null' (quotes to indicate this has nothing to do with a present /dev/null
on your root fs or ramdisk, but that it's the virtual null device) if the
struct console corresponding to /dev/console is not an existing tty device.
