this just primes all the architectures so that they build. Every 
architecture should then adjust these parameters. Also, since the 
patches are not final yet i didnt try to widen them too much.

that used to be the ARCH_HAS_* flags & macros - but these days we prefer 
clean inline functions defined per arch, no ifdefs.
If there is something that is truly shared between all arches then an 
asm-generic/*.h file can be generated for it, and included from most 
arches. I dont think the changes i did will necessiate that.
