Do not use magic numbers like this.
Please replace 4096 with PAGE_SIZE - page.h is already included so it is
available.
This servers two purposes:
1) This make it more self documenting
2) It makes it more portable should we decide to do this in a general
way for all arch's.
And then maybe a comment why it is desireable to waste a lot of RAM
in some cases. For the embedded people wasting up to 4088 bytes
of RAM is not desireable.
