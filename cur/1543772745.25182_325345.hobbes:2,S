Looks like you jumped through a bogus function pointer.  I'm guessing it 
has something to do with an unitialized IRQ vector for the CPU speed on 
one of the cores (simply because it seems somewhat plausible):
extern u8 irq_vector[NR_IRQ_VECTORS];
#define IO_APIC_VECTOR(irq)     (irq_vector[irq])
#define AUTO_ASSIGN             -1
So irq_vector[AUTO_ASSIGN] = 0xff which could have somehow made it into 
your function pointer.
Just a theory.
