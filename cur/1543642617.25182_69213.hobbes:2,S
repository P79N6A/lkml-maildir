Depends on the ventilation you can put.
In this computer I have all bays (5 1/4 and 3 1/2) full and the 
temperature doesn't get over 30
There is a total of 4 HDs and 3CDs drives.
I think the spacing depends on the heat output of the drives.
I use my  2 Samsungs (they are always cold) between the Maxtor (makes a 
lot of heat) and Fujitsu.
Of course the best is to strap 6" fans in front of them (which I did to 
cool a stack of 6 full height disks that I put in an old full tower 
cases).
