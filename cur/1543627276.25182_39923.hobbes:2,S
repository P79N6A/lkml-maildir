the dell c400 has this same problem. there is an excellent web page on one
person's experiences with it, but i can't find it right now.. anyways, his
result was that the bios was actually broken and that it would take a f/w
update from Dell to fix it. a little googling should yield the results you
want.
i assume it's probably the same situation with your laptop.
good luck,
