Subject: Problems compiling 2.2.2 Kernel...loopback.c and net/sock.h

I've run into a snag when trying to compile the 2.2.2 kernel.  This is a
compile time error when the script tries to compile loopback.c and
sock.h.
Downloaded the 2.2.2 kernel and also tried to patch a 2.2.1 kernel, still
get the same compilation errors with both types.  By the way,
2.2.0 and 2.2.1 both compiled fine on my machine, without any problems, so
this is new to me as of 2.2.2.
Checked my versions against the Documentation/Changes file, and I'm pretty
well up to day.  I'm using GLIBC 2.0.7 instead of 2.0.7pre6, which is the
only significant difference I've seen.  But again, I was able to compile
2.2.1 and 2.2.0 without a problem.
This is the first time in 2 years I've EVER had a compile time problem
with a Linux Kernel.  I'm fairly competent in doing Kernel compilations,
so if the problem is mine, please just point me in the right direction.
Here's my ver_linux script:
[root@physics linux]# sh scripts/ver_linux
