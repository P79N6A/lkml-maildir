Hi
I've booted and tested 2.6.29-rc1 (c59765042f53a79a7a65585042ff463b69cb248c)
I've observed that suspend is unusable - it goes to sleep - the sleep
LED is on. After few secs system turns on back itself - and stays in
some frozen state
and the sleep LED is still on. Usually I get black screen - but once
I've noticed screen with this text:
x86 PAT enabled  cpu0,.....
back to C
Extended CMOS year 2000
but most probably this is not very helpful - however it's kind of hard
to bisect kernel, because patches in the transition from
2.6.28->2.6.29-rc1 usually caused a lot of unstable behavior on my
T61.
So are there any suspected patches I could try to revert directly ?
(I would have assumed some new ACPI controlling for thinkpad - thought
I don't understand why it's get broken over and over again)
