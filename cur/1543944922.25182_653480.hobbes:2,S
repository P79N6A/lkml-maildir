Actually the interrupt handler in ide-cd got rewritten and you're still using the
old one (cdrom_pc_intr vs cdrom_newpc_intr). Those changes went into mainline before
the 2.6.25-rc1 so we'll be able to test the new one only when you try out 2.6.25-rc1
or wait until 2.6.25 is released in case you don't want to try hazardous materials
such as an -rc kernel[*] :).
Bart?
