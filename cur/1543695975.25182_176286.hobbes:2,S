You and me the same. Here's a message I sent to

xSubject: 2.6.0-test3-bk10-final regression getting out of hand
xDate: Fri, 31 Oct 2003 21:48:51 +0100
As reported in:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106195494828814&w=2
I'm experiencing a serious NFS regression since 2.6.0-test3-bk10-final
(bk-set determined now). Since that, along the road to 2.6.0-test9,
something has gotten completely out of hand.
cp -a /mnt/oden/etc .
_2.6.0-test3-bk10_
2 minutes
_2.6.0-test3-bk10-final_
3 minutes 47 seconds
_2.6.0-test9_
29 minutes 54 seconds
Nothing has changed in hardware or setup, and the cp tests were done
today. Not being a programmer I tried to delete individual patches in
the bk-set, but couldn't find the exact breakage point.
Erasing changes to:
linux-2.6.0-test3-bk10/fs/nfs/dir.c
No change.
Erasing changes to:
linux-2.6.0-test3-bk10/fs/nfs/nfsroot.c
No change.
Erasing changes to:
linux-2.6.0-test3-bk10/include/linux/sunrpc/timer.h
linux-2.6.0-test3-bk10/net/sunrpc/timer.c
No change.
Erasing changes to:
linux-2.6.0-test3-bk10/net/sunrpc/clnt.c
Doesn't compile.
Erasing changes to:

Using TCP or DIRECTIO in -test9 makes no difference. Here's the
relevant .config-section:
#
# Network File Systems

CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
CONFIG_NFS_V3=y
# CONFIG_NFS_V4 is not set
# CONFIG_NFS_DIRECTIO is not set

# CONFIG_NFSD_V4 is not set
# CONFIG_NFSD_TCP is not set
