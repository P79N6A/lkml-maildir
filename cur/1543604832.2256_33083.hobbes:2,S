True enough. This is a slightly dubious heuristic at best. Besides, if
the sender sets TCP_NODELAY and sends packets that are between
TCP_MIN_MSS and true receive MSS, the estimate is probably totally
hosed.
My solution to this would be to recalculate rcv_mss once per window.
I.e., start new_rcv_mss from 0, keep increasing it for one window width,
and then copy it to rcv_mss. No funny heuristics, and it would adjust to
a shrunken MSS within one transmission window.

Maybe so, but in that case I would only set it for packets > rcv_mss.
Otherwise, my ack-every-segment-with-PSH problem would come back.
Actually, I think it would be better to simply to always ack every other
segment (except in quickack and fast recovery modes) and only use the
receive window estimation for window updates. This would guarantee
self-clocking in all cases.
