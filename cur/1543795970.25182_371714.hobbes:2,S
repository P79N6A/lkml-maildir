Out-of-tree amd64 assember code is being run in kernel space. For example:
http://loop-aes.sourceforge.net/
Calling convention change that breaks existing assembler code that has been
field proven and is believed to be entirely free of bugs for long time, does
NOT belong in a STABLE kernel series.
OTOH, if your business model requires breaking stuff and then milking your
customers for "fixing" the breakage, then this type of change is
understandable.  </sarcasm>
