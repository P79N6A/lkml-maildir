Looking closer, given the assumptions you stated, I'm pretty convinced
that that check and 'bug' is unncessary in the normal case.  The delta
generated with unsigned math is correct.
However, it seems this check is more intended to check for
broken/backward-running clocks.  In which case, time_after() or
equivalent should be used.
Here's a patch to use time_after() in the 32-bit case, but we probably
really need time_after() macros which can handle 32- or 64-bit types.
