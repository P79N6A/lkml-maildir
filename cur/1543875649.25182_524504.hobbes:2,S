It's required to access data at all (BIOS-supplied password [un]locks 
disk), in a small minority of configurations.  It's strongly suggested 
for reliable suspend/resume, particularly on laptops, where libata ACPI 
support fixes some suspend/resume problems.
Some BIOSen also want to apply drive+board-specific errata workarounds. 
  That's OK, but ideally we should know about those in the kernel.
"none that regress" is the problem though.  Buggy tables, unexercised 
ACPI code paths, and in a few cases unexpected post-ACPI 
drive/controller behavior expose regressions.

Since everybody is OK with my plan, I'll send one today along with the 
rest of the post-vacation 2.6.21-rc bug fixes.
