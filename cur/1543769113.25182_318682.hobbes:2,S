Linus spat this patch back a couple of years ago.  Last time we discussed
it, a year ago, he said

  100Hz is too little for a number of users, and yes, 1kHz is too high - I 
  selected it partly because it made it oh-so-much-more-obvious when 
  some pieces weren't converted. 
  1kHz is also good in that it makes it easy to convert both to USER_HZ and 
  to ms/ns. But maybe something like 250Hz would be better - still high 
  enough that things like multimedia (which really wants higher frequencies 
  in order to be able to sleep for fractional video-frames) should be happy, 
  low enough that we use less CPU.
(The issue being that the latency of entering ACPI low-power mode is of the
order of one millisecond on some machines, so HZ=1000 whacks the battery).
So yes, the time has come around again to work out what we're going to do
about this.  I'd be a bit worried about allowing users to set HZ=724,
simply because nobody tests with that, and it might expose odd timing
relationships and unfortunate arithmetic rounding artifacts.  So if we're
going to do this thing it might be better to just offer 100, 250 and 1000.
