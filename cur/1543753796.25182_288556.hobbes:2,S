i'm not sure i understand what you mean. My change does:
| @@ -294,6 +313,7 @@ irqreturn_t timer_interrupt(int irq, voi
|         write_seqlock(&xtime_lock);
|
|         cur_timer->mark_offset();
| +       do_timer(regs);
|
|         do_timer_interrupt(irq, NULL, regs);
so ->mark_offset and do_timer() go together, and happen under
xtime_lock. What problem is there if we do this?
