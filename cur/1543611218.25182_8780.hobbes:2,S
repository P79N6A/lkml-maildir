Heh, it's funny that you mention that, because one of the goals of this project is to
access a CVS-like repository as if it were a filesystem.  I suppose that i'm not opposed
to on-disk caching of files; this may improve performance in some cases.  However, the
specific feature I need right now is that a file being modified by one person is
explicitly not seen by other people (they see the original version).  The parts that
need to be transparent to the user are the copying/moving of the file from one place
(network) to another (somewhere else).  Also, files created locally should not be
propagated back to the network unless the users explicitly specifies that they should.
So, this system is not totally transparent to the user (because we can't read the user's
mind to figure out what files (s)he would like to edit or 'check in'), but the
filesystem part of it should be.  Plus, it's important that local files and network
files appear in the same directory side by side, as if they were in the same directory
on the server.
I still haven't had a chance to look at Coda; maybe it does solve my problem, but
probably not quite.
