Jens, this patch looks like you originally removed the explicit
unplug calls that XFS used to prevent metadata I/O hangs and now you
are putting them back.  Correct?
Reading on from Andrew's earlier comments, shouldn't XFS have
worked unchanged? I'm just trying to understand why you removed
the explicit unplugs in the first place.....
Cheers,
Dave.
