It is quite simple. If 50% of your segments are busy, and the other 50% 
are free, and the file system needs a new segment, the cleaner starts 
freeing some of busy ones. If the cleaner is unable to free one segment at 
least, your file system gets "full" (and it returns a nice ENOSPC error). 
This solution wastes the half of your storage device, but it is 
deadlock-free. Obviously, there are better approaches.

Quotas, bigger meta-data device, cleverer cleaner,... there are 
solutions :)

No, you are right. It is the common case for LogFS because it has data and 
meta-data blocks in the same address space, but that is not the case of 
DualFS. Anyway, I'm very interested in your work because any solution to 
the problem of the GC will be also applicable to DualFS. So, keep up with 
it. ;-)
