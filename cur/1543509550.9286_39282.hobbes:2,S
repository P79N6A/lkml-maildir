Note that a fix using MODULE_NAME() _will_ break the current semantics
of some modules:
- we (really) should enforce everyone to have a MODULE_NAME (can we get
  a default out of __FILE_NAME__ with some tricky macro??)
- some already have a prefix encoded into their arguments (isapnp springs
  into my mind) - those will have to be ripped off - and it "breaks"
  backward-compatibility, as the prefixes are not always like "isapnp_"
now, well if its easy, I'll look into it.
