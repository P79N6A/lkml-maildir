No issues about that.  It is just that the platform bus sucks a bit if you
need to "abuse it" (no wonder!) to hang various different devices that are
provided *or* driven by the same module.

Actually, DMI is a hint for autoloading, only.  They do probe the
hardware/firmware for the needed functionality to know for sure.

That could work, yes.

Don't like that one, sorry.  Detection often needs the kind of access to
hardware that is better off contained in the kernel.

I will see what I can do about breaking it up in various modules.  But this
can be unoptimal. If I took it too seriously, thinkpad-acpi would break into
at least five different modules, if not more, and at least one or two
modules would need to be there for the common code.  There has to be a
middle ground somewhere, I think.
