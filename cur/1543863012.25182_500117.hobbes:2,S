Are 1024 bytes of a bigger kernel image really a problem? And even,
normally kernel images are compressed, and compressing 1024 zeros
can be compressed very well.
I think saving memory is more important than saving disk space. I know
that most ARM device use flash disk, but also most ARM devices have
limited RAM.
