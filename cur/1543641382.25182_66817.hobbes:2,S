well, it was not my idea, and i dont think I fully understand all that Scope
stuff in IPv6, but I wanted to say:
The kernel is asuming, that a gateway (ie forward=1) is administrated by a
experienced admin, who knows how to set up all those special V6 prefixes,
but wants to defend internet from admins who do not know.
for a single hoomed host a default route does no harm, compared to a gateway
with wrong site or lionk local scope prefix routes.

yes, because it does not maks the link and site local prefix starting with
FE and FF (like fe80::/10)

well, depends on the kernel we are talking about. I plan to have tcp,tcp46
and tcp6 (of course udp and icmp, too) entries, like BSD has.

yes

tspc works fine for me, but you are right breaking scripts is a bit ugly.
Well on the other hand, it wil lalso unbreak some bsd scripts :)
