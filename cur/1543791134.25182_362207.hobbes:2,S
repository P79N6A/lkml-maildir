Subject: [PATCH] [MMC] Use controller id instead of driver name for printks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/1/117

The printks that aren't for debugging should use the name of the controller,
not the driver name. Multiple MMC controllers aren't that common today, but
this is the right way to do things.
