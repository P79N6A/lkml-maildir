In order to log this message to syslog, you need to allow the syslog
process to run.  If you're using a uniprocessor machine, using mdelay()
doesn't allow syslog to run during this time.
Softdog has a "testing" mode, which can be enabled by defining
ONLY_TESTING.  This disables the automatic reboot, but the system
will log the timeout message.
