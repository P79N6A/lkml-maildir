You're missing the point.  Say EvilCo got hold of some GPL software,
and managed to get the FSF to release a version 3 of the GPL which
allowed them to make binary-only releases.  You may still have "full rights"
to the source released at the time, but EvilCo can still exercise the 
"or any later version" option, modify the source, and release binaries only.
