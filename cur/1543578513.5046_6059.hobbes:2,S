oh hey, this limit is only a libc limit these days.  you can do this:
#define MY_FD_SETSIZE (16384)
typedef struct {
        __fd_mask __fds_bits[MY_FD_SETSIZE / __NFDBITS];
} my_fd_set;
#define MY_FD_ZERO(_f)  (memset((_f), 0, sizeof(my_fd_set)))
and do select()s of 16384 descriptors.

poll() stops working at 16384 file descriptors (as of 2.2.14-foo original
redhat 6.2 kernel).  at least that's where i think it is, maybe it's
32768.  it's limited by the maximum kmalloc() size of 128k.  this is
somewhat unfortunate.  even though we know it'll stop performing well.
