That was the first attempt to find a solution to multihead. In fact some
of the developers are still working on it. As you can also see if the
posting with the thread other people are also working on this. I like to
see something where everyone can work together to come up with a unified
system for linux. So I'm willing to listen to anyones input. Everyone
playing with mulithead already have some experience with the problems we
are going to face. So this should accelerate developement.
