I got ~13 clocks on x86_64 and 21 on PII.  Test program below.

Well there's no real way to hide it, but something more is definitely
needed.  A new vdso entry point is easy but how do you tell userspace
it's there?  Does glibc look at the kernel version in the note?

			ITERS, (tsc2 - tsc1) / ITERS);
