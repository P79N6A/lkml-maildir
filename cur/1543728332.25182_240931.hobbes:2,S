so you can only trigger the latencies via mlockall-test if jackd is also 
running? Or do the latencies only trigger in jackd (and related 
programs)?
if the later, then i'm wondering whether any of the audio code turns off
caching for specific pages or does DMA to user pages, or mmap()s device
(PCI) memory?
