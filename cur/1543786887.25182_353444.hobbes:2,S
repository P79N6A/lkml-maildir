I discovered this other ml: 
http://lists.osdl.org/mailman/listinfo/bugme-janitors
 
So, 
http://lists.osdl.org/mailman/listinfo/bugme-new
 is just for new bugs
and 
http://lists.osdl.org/mailman/listinfo/bugme-janitors
 for everything else,
or bugme-janitors is non-functional? (I tried to subscribe to check it myself but
subscription requires "moderator approval")
If so, can we have the bugme-janitors and bugme-new archives opened for
everyone (so google can index it?)
