2.6.8.1 was also broken for kernel parameters.
acpi_os_string="Brand X" resulted in acpi_os_string="" in the kernel.

In 2.6.9 acpi_os_string="Brand X" correctly results in
acpi_os_string="Brand X" in the kernel -- so at least we got that part
right.

I verified that this new patch doesn't break the acpi_os_string="Brand
X" kernel parameter.
I'm not sure what quoted parameters for init's environment are used for,
but it looks like FOO="FOO BAR" now results in
FOO=FOO BAR
in the environment.
