I don't think it is.

My preference would be for something like:
        NETLABEL and CIPSO
        P:	Paul Moore
        M:	paul.moore@hp.com
        W:	
http://netlabel.sf.net
        L:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
        S:	Maintained
        F:	Documentation/netlabel/
        F:	include/net/netlabel.h
        F:	net/netlabel/
        Labeled IPsec and SECMARK
        P:	Paul Moore
        M:	paul.moore@hp.com
        L:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
        S:	Supported
        F:	include/linux/netfilter/*SECMARK*
        F:	net/netfilter/*SECMARK*
        
I would like to add appropriate file patterns for each
block.  Also, I'm not sure of the Supported/Maintained
status of each block.
The distinction is supposed to be:
        Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
        Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
Could you please clarify those for me?
cheers, Joe
