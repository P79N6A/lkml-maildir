Subject: [PATCH 4/4 v2] Subject: SCHED - Clean up some old cpuset logic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/10/303

From: Gregory Haskins <ghaskins@novell.com>
We had support for overlapping cpuset based rto logic in early prototypes that
is no longer used, so clean it up.
