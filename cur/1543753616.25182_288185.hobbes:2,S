We have some 3ware 7000 ATA-RAID controllers that I've tested with  
various
versions of the tools trying to get them to work:
+---------------+--------------- 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Kernel        | CLI Utility   | Functionality/Limitations              
      |
+---------------+--------------- 
+--------------------------------------------+
|               | 7000 - Stable | Works great, everything OK (Of course  
:-D) |
| Debian 2.4.28 |               |                                        
      |
|               | 7000 - In-Eng | [N/A] No such tool exists!             
      |
+---------------+--------------- 
+--------------------------------------------+
|               | 7000 - Stable | Works ok, except some operations fail  
with |
|               |               | unusual errors, and the info stuff  
doesn't |
|               |               | really work properly                   
      |
|               |               |                                        
      |
|               | 7000 - In-Eng | [N/A] No such tool exists!             
      |
|               |               |                                        
      |
|               | 9000 - Stable | Works great, everything OK, although  
some  |
|               |               | operations have status errors, though  
they |
|               |               | still function as expected.  This one  
has  |
| Debian 2.6.8  |               | an interesting new interface that I  
like.  |
|               |               |                                        
      |
|               | 9000 - In-Eng | This one lacks the new interface that  
is   |
|               |               | present in the tested release, which  
is    |
|               |               | kind of weird, given that it is a  
much     |
|               |               | newer version.  It also appears to  
work    |
|               |               | great on the 3ware 7000 card, but  
without  |
|               |               | the weird errors that plagued the  
stable   |
|               |               | tool.  This looks promising, but I  
kinda   |
|               |               | liked the interface of the 9000 tool.  
      |
