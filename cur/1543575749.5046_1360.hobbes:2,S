Subject: test12 lockups -- need feedback

At first I thought it was just me when I reported the lockups I was
having with test12 earlier this week. Now the reports are flooding. Of
course, now my machine isn't locking up anymore after recompiling from a
clean source tree (test5 w/ patches through test12)
Now, I'm trying to determine what the common element is.
Those of you who are having lockups, was test12 compiled from a patched
tree that you've previously compiled?
Those that are locking up in X. Do you have a second machine you can
hook up via serial port to grab Oops output?
I've got KDB compiled in my current kernel. I'll compile a fresh kernel
without KDB and see how long I last when I get a chance.
