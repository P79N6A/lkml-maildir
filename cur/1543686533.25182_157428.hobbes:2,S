I don't view it as "really weird" - it's something I've always done
with 2.2 and 2.4, and in fact the first thing I do when I get a machine
is to modify the inittab to halt the machine on ctrl-alt-del.
It's far safer than hitting ctrl-alt-del and trying to power the machine
off at the exact moment it reboots.
However, sometimes you want it to reboot, and in this case its far
simpler to wait for the machine to halt, and then use ctrl-alt-del
again.  It's something that's been supported by both the kernel and
init for eons.

I guess then this is another bug we need to add to the list of bugs
introduced during 2.5 into 2.6 then...
If it is changing, then someone needs to get that information into
davej's document.

The way I'm treating ->shutdown at present is that it is the final call
to the device driver.  Once this call has been made, the bus driver
puts the bus into the correct state for reboot, and the device driver
must not attempt to access it.
