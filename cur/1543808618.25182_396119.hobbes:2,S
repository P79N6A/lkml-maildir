Ick, that's kind of sucky hardware then.  My PowerBook with 1GB RAM  
easily gets a week of sleep time off a fully charged battery; I don't  
think I've rebooted it _once_ in the last 2 months, I just leave it  
sleeping in my bag the whole time.  Sony must be doing something  
wrong, because there's easily enough power in a single battery to  
keep RAM refreshed for a _long_ time.

As to the safety issue, I have my Apple Powerbook configured to  
suspend to RAM, and if it gets critically low on battery I have the  
firmware set to resume it automatically and my scripts shut it down  
so I don't lose data.  Suspend-to-RAM when implemented properly _is_  
reliable and safe, but it seems like a lot of hardware manufacturers  
get it wrong.
