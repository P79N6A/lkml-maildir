Straight from the metaphorical horses's virtual mouth:
gull:~# lspci 
00:00.0 Host bridge: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M1451 (rev ad)
00:02.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M1449 (rev b2)
00:06.0 VGA compatible controller: Chips and Technologies F65545
00:07.0 IDE interface: CMD Technology Inc PCI0640 (rev 02)
Is the "[ALi] M1451" and "[ALi] M1449" are what we are looking for here?
Thanks,
Neale.
