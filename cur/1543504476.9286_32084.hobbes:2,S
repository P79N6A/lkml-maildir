sure - d_lookup() is definitely bogus.

i agree - I wanted to have something for 2.2 for people to test - i wanted
to cure symptoms first, we have way too many latency sources right now and
i first wanted to get something that can be tested. I think that the
uaccess.h changes are too intrusive as well - i'll rework these things.
