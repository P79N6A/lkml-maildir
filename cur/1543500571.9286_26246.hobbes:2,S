With something like `find' inheriting mtime doesn't work because mtimes
can be reset with utime(), see `touch --date=...' or `touch --file=...'.
You normally want that to affect Make (that's usually deliberate), but
not a program like find which should always give the same results _as
if_ it did a full scan.
