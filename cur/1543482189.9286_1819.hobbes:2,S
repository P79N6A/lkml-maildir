Plain 2.2 is being released. The kernel reports as 2.2.0 just because
the ".0" makes filenames regular and eliminates special-case code.

I was using this:
: Today Linus Torvalds, leader of the Linux kernel development team,
: releases a major update to the Linux operating system. The new release
: brings enterprise scalability, broad support for newer hardware, and a
: large collection of new features. Highlights include:
It sounds just fine in the present tense.

We can and should gloss over that minor detail. The present tense is
more exciting. It gives an active feel.

Such URLs are too long. Kill them.

It is better. The first sentence takes too long parse. It looks like
"proprietary" modifies "protocol network devices". There is no such
thing as "protocol network devices". Simple fix: kill "protocol".
You still have "wide support for a wide" in your text.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers...
Support for protocols has little to do with taking control.
I just think "a wide variety of protocols," should go.
Firewall info has clearly been tacked onto the end. Firewalls need
to be in the list of features that let you control your intranet.
If you don't agree with that, at least get rid of "In addition,"
and replace "significantly improved" with a comment about how the
new code gives better control.

That got a bit long. Maybe this:

:   infrastructure and hard disk storage, including swap space.

Are you sure they want to see it _there_? It is a very bad place.
You were also vague about internationalization. Linux 2.2 has
Euro support in keymaps, in console maps, and in fonts.

I like "File server destruction" better, because RAID already protects
you from some hardware malfunctions. Coda is much more capable.
I also think it is good to avoid wording that uses so many commas
in multiple ways. You have a comma delimited list enclosed in commas.

It is good to mention "Linux" often. Perhaps you would prefer this:

: video conferencing and recording support, TV tuner support, and
: enhanced audio support.

No, that would be multiple computers (or non-PC non-Mac hardware).
Nobody sane would make non-SMP multiprocessor support for a PC.

Passive voice is almost always bad. You use it when you have to
testify about what you did to a whitehouse intern.
What about the parody appearance?

Yes indeed, this is a press release. Kill Samba. I read all the
kernel patches, and I assure you that Samba was not integrated
into the 2.2 kernel.

You must add "Windows and Windows NT are..." to go with it. Eeew.

Are you suggesting that Linux has something that must be fixed? :-)

You may feel very strongly about the information, but that doesn't

You can just ignore SuSE, Red Hat, and all the rest.

**ahem**
I write free software. I use the GPL, but I keep the copyright.
There is nothing "GNU" about my stuff except for the license.
Don't you dare lump my code in with the GNU project.
You have also left out some really huge contributers, such as
the X consortium and the University of California.
Out of 64 processes running on my system now (about 40 unique),
only bash is GNU software. This is normal Red Hat stuff.
I'm actually running more GNU junk on Digital Unix right now.
You could get sued over "GNU/Digital Unix" too.

Now you have to explain what an UltraSPARC is and why someone
should care about UltraSPARC support. This press release is too
long now. It is time to chainsaw this document, and you might as
well start here.
>> the 386 (long gone),
> 
> Not where I worked...
...but not where you work.
I'm at a poorly funded public university. The 386 hardware was
removed about 2.5 years ago, and wasn't being used much then.
In 1995 I worked at a place with 250 people, many of which were
normal office workers. They had very few 386 machines left.
The 386 was introduced in 1985. Computer hardware doesn't usually
last for 14 years.
Yeah, some people are using hardware that is over a decade old.
Some people still have an Apple II and some people run DOS 3.3.

Nobody should care who designed the document, but the results matter.
The results: everybody's pet feature is listed.

I agree. Don't mention them - but don't mention any other particular
means of Internet support either. Leave the reference general.

Yes - but you need a general term that covers both.

Put it back in for a reason: normal OS support is costly.
Linux support on the Internet is cheap because everybody
can learn about the system internals. Support costs matter.
This is an important Linux feature, and you only need 15
characters to express it.

Sure, but most people use different names. Your "usenet" is
"news groups" to me, but "discussion groups" or "boards" to
someone else. I'd guess "news groups" is the most common term,
but I wouldn't want to assume that it is.

Take a guess and you will be right. That is the beauty of it;
you can get support in the form that you might expect.
If you have some other general term, feel free to substitute.
Example:
: Both traditional support contracts and cost-effective Internet
: support resources are widely available.

Important URLs get lost in that huge collection. It also looks
like you endorse particular distributions and projects.
Worse yet, YOU ARE BEING TOTALLY POLITICAL about this. You have
excluded www.linux.org, which happens to be a very good site.
More than any other site, www.linux.org has earned a place.
You should not be doing a press release if you can't keep your
political views out of it.
