Yes, they're kinda a series of their own.  But I still think we really
want this in -mm.  As we've seen on the kernel summit there's a pretty
desparate need for it.  And there's not many changes in this area in
-mm, maybe the unprivilegued mounts.  I'd personally prioritize the
r/o bindmounts over them as they're more needed and we need more reviewing
of the unprivilegued mounts (I'll try to come back to that soon).
FYI:  the series you sent out are missing the last two patches, and while
they compile as-is they're actually missing the interesting part :)
