	If further info is needed with respect to configuration,
   System map, etc, let me know and I'll provide those details.  I
   don't know enough about this to know what is relevant.
Please run this dump through the ksymoops utility, without doing that
it is nothing but a bunch of magic numbers and we can't begin to debug
it.
Later,
