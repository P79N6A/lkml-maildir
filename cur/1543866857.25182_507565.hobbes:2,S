I disagree. This message can be very helpful. The problem of network
interfaces being renamed is a real and frequent one. A single message
per interface is tolerable even if you don't actually need it. My
kernel log currently produces well over 400 messages per boot, so if
you want to reduce kernel log clutter, there are lots of other
candidates.
