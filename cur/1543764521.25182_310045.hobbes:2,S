Paolo is Spanish (or Italian), whereas Paulo is a Portuguese name.

Yes, but the cleanup is already just barely justifiable. 75% (or more) 
of the calls will use just one parameter. Adding a stupid "1" to all of 
those will make the cleanup even less worth while.

Ok, I've read Jörn's mail also and I think I can help out. It seems 
however that there are more people working on this. Will it be better to 
coordinate so we don't duplicate efforts or is the "everyone looks at 
everything" approach better, so that its harder to miss something?
