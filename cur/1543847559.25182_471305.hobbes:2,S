This one looks interesting, but I'm not sure if we yet have the use-case
really needed to implement notifier infrastructure (taking the comments
from my last discussion). I don't really have any criticism with the
code, I just worry it might be over-doing it.
Maybe it would be more persuasive if it went together with the first
users of it, rather then as a independent infrastructure buildup patch.
thanks
