	Ok, now to the second chapter. These are all the changes
accumulated since the patch I sent one month ago (cf previous e-mail).
	Changes :
		o more Prism2/Symbol compatibility goodies
		o Tested D-Link cards and Lucent firmware 7.28
		o Cleanup, bug fixes from David Gibson
	The whole is tested, as usual... 75% of the patch was on my
web pages for the last month and people seem to have liked it.
	I've made 2 patches, one for 2.4.4-pre6 and one for
2.4.3-ac13. The difference between the two is minor (one line).
	Linus : please have a look at orinoco_v4b.diff (first
attachement). Of course, this patch will apply and work only if you
have applied the patch in my previous e-mail.
	Alan : orinoco_v4b-alan.diff is for you (second attachement).
	Have fun...
	Jean
