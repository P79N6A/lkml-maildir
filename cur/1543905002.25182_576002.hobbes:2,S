Thanks for all the answers.  The common code is mostly handling
the message passing for hardware  initialization, rings creation
and some ioctls.  drivers/message looks like a good place for this
code to live.

Perhaps drivers/message - well I can't answer that exactly.
As far as the output object files are concerned, it is not relevant,
since they will be autoloaded anyway :)
