I'm traveling around the country myself.

Well, thanks for the attempt.
Hmmm...  I don't _think_ the software suspend logic is likely to snapshot any 
strange timer state, but I dunno.  On resume, the system goes into a swap 
frenzy trying to get everything back in.  (This thinkpad can only hold 192 
megabytes of ram, and as far as I can tell Konqueror never actually frees any 
memory it allocates, so I'm usually about halfway into swap.)  So if there's 
any possibility of the world's strangest race condition occurring on resume, 
this thing could probably trigger it.  My suspend script is just:
#!/bin/sh
sync
#echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep
hwclock --hctosys
# rdate -s clock.psu.edu
dhclient eth0

The odd part is that dhclient thought it had negotiated a connection before 
the wireless card decided to curl up and die.  Too bad the card couldn't 
either start over initializing the sucker again, or at least print a stack 
trace of where it to confused...
I'll let you know if it happens again.  That's the...  second or third time 
I've seen it in the past four or five months.  (It happens.  Just not often 
enough to determine a pattern.)
