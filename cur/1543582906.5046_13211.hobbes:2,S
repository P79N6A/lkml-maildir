Francis, do I understand that you can remove the disk while it is
mounted? If so, there is a later version of ide-floppy.c (0.96) on
sourceforge.net which for some reason hasn't made it into the -ac kernels.
With 2.4.2 vanilla and ide-floppy 0.96 I don't get this problem, it also
removes some i/o error messages I was seeing.
