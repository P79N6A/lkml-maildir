It's happening spontaneously for me: never yet while I'm actually typing,
but in between sessions.  I tried rebooting with kdb-reset this time, and
I got "Keyboard reset failed, no ACK".
I've tried swapping the Logitech mouse for a Digital one, because this
problem has only started occurring since I swapped them originally.
