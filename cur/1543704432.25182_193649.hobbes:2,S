I added it and now get:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/data2/usr/local/src/linux-2.4-pre/include -Wall
-Wstrict-pro
totypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
-fomit-frame-pointer
 -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 -malign-functions=4
-DMODULE -DM
ODVERSIONS -include
/data2/usr/local/src/linux-2.4-pre/include/linux/modversions
.h  -nostdinc -iwithprefix include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=it8181fb  -c -o
it8181fb.o 
it8181fb.c
it8181fb.c: In function `it8181fb_init':
it8181fb.c:1200: `PCI_DEVICE_ID_ITE_IT8181' undeclared (first use in
this functi
on)
it8181fb.c:1200: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
it8181fb.c:1200: for each function it appears in.)
it8181fb.c: At top level:
it8181fb.c:162: warning: `fontname' defined but not used
make[2]: *** [it8181fb.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory
`/data2/usr/local/src/linux-2.4-pre/drivers/video'
So maybe it really is a MIPS only file (I am on x86)?
