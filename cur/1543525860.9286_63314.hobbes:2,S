Hi y'all,
A little while ago I reported an apparent y2k bug in the Linux kernel.
Alan Cox replied, saying that the problem of the year being reported
as 1910 couldn't possibly be due to the kernel, and that perhaps some
buggy application was setting the system date, causing it to propagate
outwards from there (i.e., bad values from time() and gettimeofday()).
I thought about it a few minutes ago realized that I might have used the
'nist' command (which querys the National Institute of Standards and
Technology's atomic clock over the Internet) to set the date on both of
those systems.  And so I ran nist, and guess what it reported?
[jayts jay]$ nist -d
51589 00-02-15 03:37:22 00 0 0  99.9 UTC(NIST) *
Local time: 10-02-15 03:37:22
New time: Tue Feb 15 03:37:22 1910
So much for the accuracy of atomic clocks and buggy applications!  I'm
now assuming that this is what caused the problem.
Thanks Alan, and I guess we can let go of this as a kernel bug.
Cheers,
Jay Ts
