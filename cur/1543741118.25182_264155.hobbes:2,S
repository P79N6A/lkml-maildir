It isnt always broken hardware either. You have no idea at the core
level how the internals are configured. Thus for example if a device
provides both legacy and non-legacy ports disabling it can do horrible
things on pci unregister (eg soundcards with legacy joystick mappings)
As to video, well we don't always have an owner for video but unloading
frame buffers doesn't want to turn the video card off either..
