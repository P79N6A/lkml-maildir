I downloaded the 2.4.17-pre3 kernel from Redhat's site with their patches,
and I compiled it. Still having the same problem with the IRQ. Below is
what I get from lspci and dmesg. This time I did not pass the kernel
pci=biosirq which I had done in the past. Is this something that the
bios just isn't reporting or is there some sort of fix I can do?
$ lspci -vv
