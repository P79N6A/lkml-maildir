I agree, I've used XFS for about three years on Linux now, and whilst I love 
the performance and self-repair attributes of the filesystem, I do think it 
leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to file corruption.
In my experience, using a standard XFS log/volume setup on the same physical, 
cheap IDE HD, any files open at the time as a power down or hardware lockup 
end up being filled either with zeros, or garbage.
However, I'd far rather lose a few files once in a blue moon than have to sit 
through 10 minute fsck's every time the kernel crashes or I kick out the 
plugs.
