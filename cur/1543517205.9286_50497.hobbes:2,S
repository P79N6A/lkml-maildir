I'm using an NEC versa 4050c.  I had to use this to get it to compile w/o
pci:

It seems to work pretty well (it's only been up for 2 or 3 minutes). 
There's another problem.  I'm using a xircom ethernet+modem card.  The
network works, but the modem doesn't.  I get:
/dev/ttyS2: No such device
dmesg shows it to be io 0x0af8 irq 9.
I really wanted to try out 2.3.29 and ppp to see what problems there were (I
wanted to use 2.3 on another machine that has ppp in use)
