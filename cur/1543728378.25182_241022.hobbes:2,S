The userbase for building kernels are only increasing and there
continue to be more focus from the embedded people.
Having experince in this field first-hand tells me that a kernel
that can be build on several paltforms are a good thing.
For kbuild you will at some point start to see patches so at least
the build system does not restrict us to Linux alone.
People on this list usually reply: "shift development to a Linux
based platform". This is for many developers a nice dream,
but they are restricted by coporate rules etc.
So please feed patches to this list with your findings.

Please submit a patch for this and make sure to include Roman Zippel, he
is the maintainer of kconfig.
[I recall RedHat already disables the shared library??]
