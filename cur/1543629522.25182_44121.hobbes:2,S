You've got been mistaken by unfortunate name (Martin changed
name dmaproc() to udma() in 2.5.12).
Code calls ide_dma_check for chipsets which registerered udma()
handler (formerly dmaproc()), I think the same 2.4 does.
btw. udma() name is really misleading,
     it should be read (u)dma() not udma() :)
