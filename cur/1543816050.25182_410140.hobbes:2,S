Oh ... but since we didn't have adjtimex implemented, it wasn't
hooked into the syscall table.  This additional patch does that.
I'm in two minds whether it would be useful to add (nobody has
complained about the lack of 32-bit adjtimex support so far, so
this may be all risk, with no benefit).
Add it if you like.
