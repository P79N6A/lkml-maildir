Hi all, I have been trying to compile the 2.2.2 kernel
but I am running into problems.
I am running RH5.1, 2.0.36 at the moment and started 
to compile the new kernel, but it never finishes.
The last number of lines after I do a make are as 
follows:
gcc: Internal compiler error: program ld got fatal
signal 11
make[3]: ***[conmakehash] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory
'usr/src/linux-2.2.2/drivers/char'
make[2]: ***[first_rule] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory
'usr/src/linux-2.2.2/drivers/char'
make[1]: ***[_subdir_char] Error2
make[1]: Leaving directory
'usr/src/linux-2.2.2/drivers'
make: ***[_dir_drivers] Error 2
Can anyone explain these errors?
Thanks for any help
Shane
