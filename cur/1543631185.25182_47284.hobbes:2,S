I was looking at this with Jack Vogel and I can't figure out how it goes 
wrong, either.  However, the code in move() that uses the cpu number is a bit 
strange.  Entering loops in their middles is generally considered bug-prone 
by programming style books.  What about eliminating the goto by using 
something like the attached patch?
