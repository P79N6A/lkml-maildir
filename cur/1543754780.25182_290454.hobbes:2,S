And in fact, I'm pretty sure RC1 handled it fine too.  This failure
appeared in a BK pull I did a couple days before RC2, and installing
it clobbered a "more virgin" RC1 install; so it's hard to verify.
It took a while to track the failure mode down to being PMTU related,
but the only TCP-related changes I noticed in what I pulled sure
seemed like cleanups (removing some "duplicated" state).

Thanks for confirming it wasn't just me ... I confess I'm a bit
surprised more folk haven't reported this yet! 
Your symptoms are exactly like those I saw, just with a different
mission-critical application:  CVS, not SMTP.  Did you happen to
notice whether CVS pulls worked, when pushes (like this) failed?
