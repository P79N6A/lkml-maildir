Subject: [Fwd: [PATCH]2.6.3-rc2 MSI requirements in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Having spent a non trivial amount of time trying to pull in the 
code to enable MSI, I would suggest that a clear indication in 
Kconfig that MSI requires CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR would be very helpful.
Also since the MSI code was integrated into 2.6.1 I've updated the 
comment that called for installing the MSI patch.
