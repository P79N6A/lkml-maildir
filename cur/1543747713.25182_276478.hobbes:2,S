> * ATA passthru (read: SMART support)
is it still unsafe to use passthru concurrently
to normal disk I/O, as stated earlier?
an other question:
will some "coldplug" be possible with SATA?
I currently may unload the sata module, exchange the disk(s)
and reload the module again. Works file, but instead I want
to exchange a single disk of my LVM system, while all other
disks are still active.
I found some advice, on how to do that with SCSI disks.
Will it be possible with SATA, too?
Dieter.
