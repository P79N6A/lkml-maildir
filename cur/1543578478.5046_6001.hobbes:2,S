I agree, and if that's the only problem, then the appended patch will
fix it without any need to change struct nfs_fh.
As for the issue of casting 'fh->data' as a 'struct knfsd' then that
is a perfectly valid operation.
The fh->data is a cookie as far as the client is concerned, and hence
it will pass back exactly whatever the server sent it (alignment and
all).
IOW: the knfsd server copied a struct knfsd and sent it off to the
client, and now the exact same server is receiving a completely
unadulterated version of said struct knfsd for use by the lockd server
routines.
Unless somebody is using one compiler for the knfsd directory and then
a completely different one for lockd, I fail to see why this should
result in structure alignment problems on PPC or on any other
platform.
Cheers,
