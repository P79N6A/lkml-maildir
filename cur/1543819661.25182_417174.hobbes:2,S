We're not?  Does Jens know that?
__generic_file_splice_read seems to violate this principle!
Are you allowed to look at ->mapping? Or can that change magically
too?  What's the threat-model?  Is it splice(), or something more wicked?

Uhmm... possibly OK, but I think I'd rather change find_get_pages to
take an index pointer like find_get_pages_tag does, and do the thing
safely.  However that started turning into a big patch (reiserfs calls
find_get_pages directly a few times, and I hadn't even got up to
callers of pagevec_lookup....
So when I have a cleared head and a bit more time I'll see if I can
come up with a better patch which only looks at ->index under
->tree_lock.
Thanks for the feedback,
