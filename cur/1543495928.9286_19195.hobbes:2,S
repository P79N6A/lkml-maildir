I'd appreciate it if people would leave linux-kernel clean
now that we're still debugging 2.2.x...
There are better places for wish-lists like these, you know.
Several months ago I set up a mailing list to lighten the
linux-kernel traffic a bit:   linux-future@nl.linux.org
$ subscribe linux-future | mail majordomo@nl.linux.org
Now, back to debugging the 2.2.x kernel...
