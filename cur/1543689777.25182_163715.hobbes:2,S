There aren't any clues in the kernel logs, except that the kernel does
report "nfs server not responding" and never comes back with "nfs
server OK".  I've enabled kernel debugging on all of the cluster nodes,
but the above message is all that I get in the logs.
I'll have to try out tcpdump the next time this happens.
Thanks,
Joshua Weage
