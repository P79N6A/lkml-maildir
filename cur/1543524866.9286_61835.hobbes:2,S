Get to the point. If you have a specific gripe then let's hear it.
If you just want to generally complain, email the individuals.
If you have some good s/w you want to let out that's great.
If you don't want to let it out, that's your choice. People
choose to live in Linuxland because they see a benefit to
themselves. If you don't like the place you are free to leave.
