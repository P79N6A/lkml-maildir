It is doesn't need sound_config.h, then it doesn't need sound_config.h.

Your change is more simple, yes, but since sound_config.h is in
linux/drivers/sound not linux/include/linux, it is more of a private
header.
So, unless it is required by the module, IMNSHO you should not include
sound_config.h...
