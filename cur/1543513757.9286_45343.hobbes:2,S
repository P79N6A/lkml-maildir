Hmmh, well the ones in Debian unstable seem to work quite fine (ie. exactly
as well as the recompiled ones).

If this is any help in finding the reason, the message sequence is reliably
triggered on small incoming TCP packets at least. Like this (nightrunner is
the ISDN machine, gunbuster is a machine elsewhere in the Internet):
nightrunner:$ nc -l -p 2000
gunbuster:$ echo foo|nc nightrunner.whatever.fi 2000
(nightrunner logs the sequence "under 0 2", "under 4 5", "under 0 2" here)
Switching the machines (ie. listening on the outside and sending from the
ISDN machine) no messages get logged. Card is Teles 16.0, HiSax driver,
using one channel only. ICMP doesn't seem to trigger it (tried pings of
64bytes, 10000bytes and 50000bytes, nothing in log). I'll try more stuff if
you think it's of any use, can provide more info about the configuration
too if it seems necessary. Just ask if you want me to try something or give
more info.

Actually I can't since I want some other messages that come on that
priority to really be logged, but perhaps I'll just comment this one and
recompile my kernel (argh darn, another 402min compile ;)
