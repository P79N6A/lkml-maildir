Can't argue w/ a diffstat like that :)
Glad to see the code is working for you!

That looks redundant to the calculate_interval code in timer.c and
points to a need for a generic nanosecond to cycles interface. I'll put
that on my TODO list.

Hmm.. Hopefully the future NTP cleanup will remove the need for these
sorts of, uh.. tricks. :)
