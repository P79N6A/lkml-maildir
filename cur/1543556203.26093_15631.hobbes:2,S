Actually, there is some benefit in leaving the LINUX_VERSION_CODE checks
there...  If someone wants to back-port the driver to 2.2, this makes it
much easier.  Also, some people like to maintain a single driver for all
of the kernel versions, so they don't have to bugfix each driver version.
Cheers, Andreas
