However both of them should use the same end point routines and the

We have an MMU so if you just n thousand "get me a page" calls its quite
happy.

What if your user space is swapped out - you can't page it back in
safely

Just get_free_page them - if you can handle it over 4Gb then specify
that high pages are fine and kmap them to copy into them - that makes
the VM on giant boxes way happier. For bonus points also adjust the
virtual memory accounting.

Not really, especially if you are allowing high pages

No but both can call sys_machine_restart or whatever

Don't do that sequence on a panic IMHO (this is a standing issue, we
should not pass NULL but REBOOT/PANIC/KEXEC/... so the drivers can make
that decision - then we can do it right
