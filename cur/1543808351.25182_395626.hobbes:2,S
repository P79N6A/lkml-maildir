If there is no actual need for the application to start a write (eg
for data integrity) then why would it ever do that?

Oh yeah it is easy if you want to define some more APIs and do
it in a Linux specific way.
But the main function of msync(MS_ASYNC) AFAIK is to *start* IO.
Why do we care so much if some application goes stupid with it?
Why not introduce a linux specific MS_flag to propogate pte dirty
bits?
