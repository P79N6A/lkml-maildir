Since each logical device does not know who use it, it can not be,
for example, removed optimally.
You need to run through whole superio device set to find those one that 
has reference to logical device being removed.
And situation become much worse, when we have so called logical device
clones - 
it is virtual logical device that emulates standard one, but inside
performs
in a different way. Clone creates inside superio device(for example such
device
can live at different address).
When you do not have ldev->sc relation, you must traverse through each
logical device 
in each superio chip to find clones.
Thus you will need to traverse through each superio chip, 
then through each logical device it references, just to remove one
logical device.
