It's quite surprising that reiserfs is so slow at deletion. In my
normal experience reiserfs rm -rf is much faster than anything else
(e.g. with a big rm -rf on an ext2 you have a chance to ctrl-c still,
on reiserfs no such chance; XFS is really slow at this). Perhaps this
is some 2.5 regression? Do you have 2.4 comparison numbers?
