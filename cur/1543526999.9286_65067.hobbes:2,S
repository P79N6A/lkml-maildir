Agreed, the man page does say that. But it seemed to work fine with my
old mainboard (Tyan S1590S/VIA MVP3), and the UDMA HOWTO indicates that it
should work fine with any newer VIA chipset.  Additionally after further
testing all it seems to need is -d 1 all by itself to cause some superblock
corruption (maybe the drives are already in an UDMA mode after booting?).
I do have the correct 80-conductor cable, counted the wires to make sure,
and the drives definitely do support up to UDMA mode 4.
Is there any way to get this to work?  There's a drastic speed improvement
with -X 66 (hdparm -t goes from not quite 5 mb/sec to just over 21 mb/sec)
and I'd love to get it to work.  Thanks!
