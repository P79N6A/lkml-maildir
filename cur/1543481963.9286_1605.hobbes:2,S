  We have in-house Web server which serves dynamic content. With kernel 2.0
we had fair amounts of connections in CLOSE state and that was not too
serious problem for server as it remained alive for days and weeks.
  With 2.2-final, we also have CLOSE connections from time to time, but now
it looks like it slows TCP traffic from other threads of our Web server a
lot. Is there something we can do with our TCP handling.
  TIA,
  dragisha
