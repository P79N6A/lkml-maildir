I think I've explained it well, more concretely, it tries to fill the
ipaddr member of the task_struct structure with the IP address
associated to the user running @current task/process,if available.
Then, it will be attached within the proc fs in an entry called ipaddr,
under the proper pid directory.
The whole thing is almost self-explaining by just looking at the code.
Cheers,
