Please use a 'struct class' instead of a 'struct class_device'.  We have
almost rid the kernel of all usages of 'struct class_device' and want to
remove that structure entirely soon.  I'm aiming for 2.6.25 and it's
looking good.
So please don't add new instances of it, you can do all the same things
with a 'struct device' and it should be a very trivial change.
thanks,
