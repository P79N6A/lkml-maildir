I also agree.
The problem (for me at least) is that bad coding style needs
to be fixed before I can do a functional code review, so it
slows down the review cycle quite a bit.  Further, it's mostly
well-known what the requirements are, so there aren't very
many good excuses not to follow CodingStyle...
