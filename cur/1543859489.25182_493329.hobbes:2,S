Are you using IDE in PIO mode?  If so, the bug probably lies there.
As I've said repeatedly when asked by IDE folk to test their PIO-based
cache coherency fixes, I am unable to reproduce the bug, ergo I am
unable to test the fix.
(Some people, such as Jeff Garzik to name names, took that as me being
entirely unreasonable and un-cooperative.  But consider carefully - how
can _anyone_ test something that they can't produce.  I consider Jeff's
comments extremely very childish in that respect.)
Hence, as far as I'm aware, Linux on PIO-based IDE ARM hardware remains
utterly *unsafe*.
Sorry.
