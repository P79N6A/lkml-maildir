On the basis of your ridiculous allegations I regret it would be unreasonable
to continue to work with you on anything NWFS related. We have no 'deal'
about tools as you claim either. Please direct all your 2.2.x discussions
directly to Linus since I would hate to risk them being touched by some
potentially impartial body.
