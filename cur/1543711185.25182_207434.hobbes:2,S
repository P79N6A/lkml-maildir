otherwise I might not, especially true for bigger threads. so please, cc

That's because PATA TCQ sucks :-)

Since reiser is the first implementation of it, it gets to chose how
this works. Currently that's done by giving -o barrier=flush (=ordered
used to exist as well, it will probably return - right now we just
played with IDE).

Yes.

Only PATA core needs to support it, not the chipset drivers. md and dm
aren't a difficult to implement now that unplug/congestion already
iterates the device list and I added a blkdev_issue_flush() command.

Usual approach - just start writing, it's a lot easier to get
corrections (people seem to be several times more willing to point out
your errors than give you recomendations for something you haven't
started yet).

No.
