Hi,
I just build and booted 2.3.99-pre2-2. Things did
not work to well:
When I tried to dial into my ISP (just now I'm connected
with 2.2.12-20, i.e. the default RedHat-6.1 kernel), the
following happened:
Mar 16 23:29:01 thrawn pppd[763]: pppd 2.3.10 started by root, uid 0
Mar 16 23:29:01 thrawn ifup-ppp: pppd started for ppp2 on /dev/ttyI0 at 115200

Mar 16 23:29:06 thrawn pppd[763]: Serial connection established.
Mar 16 23:29:06 thrawn pppd[763]: Using interface ppp0

Mar 16 23:29:25 thrawn pppd[763]: Terminating on signal 15.
As you can see, the dial-in was successful, but the system failed
to do the PPP connection setup. When I tried to shut the interface
down (/sbin/ifdown), the machine completely froze. I had to do a hard
reset to reboot.
Another oddity: the /proc/devices contained entries with
printk format specifiers in it, e.g. pts/%d (or something like
this, this is from memory).
