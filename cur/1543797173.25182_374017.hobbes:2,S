First rule if you're looking for some help : be precise. 2.6.x is not
a kernel version, and ARM is more a family than a processor.

From your report below, I think that you now need to add some debug
code to your driver. It seems reasonable that a new development is
buggy at first, and a broken ethernet driver can easily lead to
corrupted data.

it may simply mean that it has lost access to the other one and that
the ARP cache has expired.

before asking, have you tried :
  - change your switch and connect with a cross-over cable
  - sending icmp, udp
  - transfer in each direction separately to check whether it happens
    on transmit / receive / both
  - reduce MTU on one, then the other, then both ends
  - ping during the transfer
?

with so few information, it's hard to say. At most, we can deduce that
you encountered a problem the first time you tried your fresh new driver.
