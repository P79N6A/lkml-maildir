Basically its oopsing because it was about to make an APM call on a
processor other than CPU#0 (physical id), it set the cpus_allowed mask
to CPU#0 only and then rescheduled but ended up on a CPU that was not
CPU#0. Thats because its not making the right and proper calls for the
O(1) scheduler - Willy's patch I merged is right - but not for -ac.
I'll fix that in -ac5.
It should be enough to swap
		current->cpus_allowed = 1;
with
		set_cpus_allowed(current, 1 << cpu_logical_map(0));
in that file
