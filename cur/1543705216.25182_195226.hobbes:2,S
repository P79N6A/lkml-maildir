This means your situation is different from what you describe. Python may
not in fact be doing 'real' threading on your setup. I suggest you try to
make the smallest possible python program that exhibits the program and send
it to the list.
Can you also run the Python program with LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4 ? And my
program too.
Thanks.
