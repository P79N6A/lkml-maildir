Yes. My memory is now coming back.  I did a few weird things in there 
when I was making the binary interface optional, and it looks like
I never updated the #ifdef in fs/proc/root.c  The primary intent
was to allow the proc support without the binary interface but I
guess the other configuration makes some sense as well in an embedded
scenario when you are trying to be as efficient as possible.  As I
recall the binary interface is less resource intensive then the /proc
interface.
