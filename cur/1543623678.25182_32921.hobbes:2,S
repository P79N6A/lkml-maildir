I can really recommend 2.4.18-pre9-mjc2; it's _much_ better than 
2.4.18-pre8-mjc (I guess that's the difference between K2 and K3) and gives 
great interactive feel. I had it running continously for almost 20 days now 
and I've beaten it like hell, with vmware, wine, heavily threaded java apps, 
etc..  While doing really crazy things like "make -j 200" on my lowend athlon 
with 640MB RAM, the system remains 100% responsive, and this with a load well 
over 200 and more than 1000 processes!!
Where these "performance" enhancements are really getting invaluable, is when 
you do things like opening 1000 mp3 files in konqueror thinking you had 
"allow multiple instances" disabled in xmms... ; 
the stock 2.4 kernel just falls flat in such a situation, not even giving you 
the possibility to switch to the console to type "killall xmms" :-) 
so all these "performance" patches (especially the scheduler of course) do 
have invaluable benefits even for normal users with UP systems, and are 
therefore, IMHO of course, worth being integrated into 2.4 mainline.
cheers,
Yven
P.S: thanks for all the fantastic work :-)
