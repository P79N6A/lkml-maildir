It's a bad idea to share even read-only data, but the impact of read-only 
data is much less that read-write. In particular, you should avoid sharing 
_any_ code and data in the same physical L1 cache-line, since that will be 
a big problem for any CPU with exclusion between the I$ and D$.
HOWEVER, modern x86 CPU's tend to have the I$ be part of the cache 
coherency protocol, so instead of having exclusion they allow sharing as 
long as the D$ isn't actually dirty. In that case it's fine to share 
read-only data and code, although the cache utilization goes down if you 
do a lot of it.
Anyway, as long as they are in separate cache-lines, you should be ok even 
on something with cache exclusion.
When it comes to actually _writing_ to the data, at least on the P4 you
don't want to have read-write data anywhere _near_ the I$ (somebody
reported half-page granularity). This is true on crusoe too, btw (at a
128-byte granularity).
Anyway, I think gcc should make sure that even the ro-data section is at
least cacheline-aligned so that it stays away from cachelines used for I$.  
That makes sense even on CPU's that don't have exclusion, since it
actually gives slightly better L1 cache utilization.
You can run this (stupid) test-program to try. On my P4 I get
	empty overhead=320 cycles
	load overhead=0 cycles
	I$ load overhead=0 cycles
	I$ load overhead=0 cycles
	I$ store overhead=264 cycles
and on my PIII I get
	empty overhead=74 cycles
	load overhead=8 cycles
	I$ load overhead=8 cycles
	I$ load overhead=8 cycles
	I$ store overhead=103 cycles
and (just for fun) on an old crusoe I get
	empty overhead=67 cycles
	load overhead=-9 cycles
	I$ load overhead=-14 cycles
	I$ load overhead=-14 cycles
	I$ store overhead=12 cycles
where that "negative overhead" just shows that we do some strnge things to
scheduling, and the loop actually ends up faster if it has a load in it
than without the load..
But you can see that storing to code is a really bad idea. Especially on a 
P4, where the overhead for a store was 264 cycles! (You can also see the 
cost of doing just the empty synchronization and rdtsc - 320 cycles for a 
rdtsc and two locked memory accesses on a P4).
I don't have access to an old Pentium - I think that was the one that had 
the strict exclusion between the L1 I$ and D$, and then you should see the 
I$ load overhead go up.
