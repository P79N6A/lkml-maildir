Yes it works :-/
I've put some things which on the web which might be helpful:
dmesg		
http://files.rfc2324.org/mptsas_panic/2.6.22-dmesg
lspci -v	
http://files.rfc2324.org/mptsas_panic/2.6.22-lspci-v
.config		
http://files.rfc2324.org/mptsas_panic/2.6.22-config
I'll search for the last working kernel and try to break it down to a
commit tommorow when I can get a serial console or direct access.
The Java driven console redirection is everything else than fulfilling :-(
