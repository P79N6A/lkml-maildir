Currently the uart_info structure is allocated on an open, so it's not
available until that point in time.  The trouble is that console_init() is
called before memory is set up, so you can't allocate the uart_info
until it's too late for the console or a debugger that wants to work
early, though it's ok for IPMI.

I thought that inlines were preferred, but I can do macros.

I'm not really sure.  For IPMI I could do without it, but I'm not
sure about consoles or debuggers.
I have a patch that does consoles over this.  Part of that is moving
the transmit (circ) buffer to the port, so that port->info is not required
at all for console I/O and the console code can supply its own transmit
buffer.  This allows the polled I/O code to reuse all the standard uart
operations for the low-level driver and for the user code, just having
to add a function to call the interrupt handlers properly.
The uart_info struct is not very big, maybe it would be best to pull that
into uart_port?  But the circ buffer might still be a problem, since it
would need to be dynamically allocated and it might need to be
checked instead.
