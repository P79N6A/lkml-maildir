Actually, we do. From include/asm-generic/rmap.h:
static inline void pgtable_add_rmap(struct page * page, struct mm_struct * mm, unsigned long address)
{
#ifdef BROKEN_PPC_PTE_ALLOC_ONE
	/* OK, so PPC calls pte_alloc() before mem_map[] is setup ... ;( */
	extern int mem_init_done;
	if (!mem_init_done)
		return;
#endif
	page->mapping = (void *)mm;
	page->index = address & ~((PTRS_PER_PTE * PAGE_SIZE) - 1);
	inc_page_state(nr_page_table_pages);
}
So pagetable pages are tagged with the right information, and in
principle could even be tagged here with the pmd in page->private.
These fields are actually required for use by try_to_unmap_one(),
and something similar could be done for a try_to_move_one(). This
information remains intact with shared pagetables, and is generalized
so that the PTE page is tagged with a list of mm's (the mm_chain),
and in that case no unique pmd could be directly stored in the page,
but it could just as easily be derived from the mm's in the mm_chain.
But there's no denying it would involve a substantial amount of work.
