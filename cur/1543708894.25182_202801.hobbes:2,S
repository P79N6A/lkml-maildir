Which is why root has to be in control of the mechanism.

Any mechanism that causes a task to be treated more favourably than 
others needs to be under root's control.  It's root's prerogative to 
decide who deserves more favourable treatment.  This is even more 
important (for obvious reasons) if a reservation (or guarantee) 
mechanism is involved.
I'd like to stress at this point that xmms only needs a boost under 
extremely high loads and this issue is being blown out of proportion.
