Thats pretty much what the code does, but you still are putting a
certain amount of policy in the kernel...

Multiseat isn't what i would want as a default on any machine, so the
default setup should be to clone the single user onto as many screens
as possible, as this is what users expect.. the system startup scripts
can then reconfigure it, to suit the admins needs..
