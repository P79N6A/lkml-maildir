Looks like NFSD isn't available in your kernel.

Are you using Red Hat? The script is looking through the process table for
processes with 'nfsd' in the command line. It's finding its own "grep nfsd" and
deciding that the process is alive :)
Apparently there's an updated initscripts package available that fixes this.

I can't see CONFIG_NFSD in there. It should be between CONFIG_NFS_FS and 
CONFIG_NFSD_SUN.
