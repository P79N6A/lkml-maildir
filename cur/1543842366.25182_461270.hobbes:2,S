No, sorry, I cannot seem to reproduce it under -rc6. It seems to stabilize 
eventually. But it doesn't under -rc2. I looked through all commits to 
ext3 code between -rc2 and -rc6 and I don't see any obvious reasons why a 
memory leak may have been fixed. Unless somebody can sched some light on 
this, I'll try to upgrade the problematic system to -rc6 tomorrow.
Just to be quite sure - this cannot (or is very unlikely to) be a libc 
bug, right?
Thanks
