The community is an amorphous thing so thats tricky to define
For general kernel stuff I think a lot of people may not know that Rik
van Riel is generating 2 hourly diff sets between Linus tagged releases
and the head of the BK tree. So for the general "give me Linus kernel
right now case" - the big bandwidth eater its probably a lot simpler
for Larry to say "its on ftp.nl.linux.org" than waste time on code
