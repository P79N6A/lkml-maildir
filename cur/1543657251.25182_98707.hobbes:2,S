Hm, I can't duplicate this myself here.  My pl2303 device works just
fine, but it is one that doesn't need the "hack" to work properly.  And
I didn't change any code in that area.
Can you duplicate this when you plug in your pl2303 device, after
booting?  And can you enable CONFIG_KALLSYMS to get a better oops
message that might be more helpful?
thanks,
