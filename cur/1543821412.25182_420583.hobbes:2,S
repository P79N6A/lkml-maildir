Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello.
These are parts of patches for new nodes addition v4.
When new node is added, new pgdat must be allocated and initialized.
But, ia64 has copies of node_data[] on each node. So, kernel has to
allocate not only pgdat but also its copies area. and all of copies
must be updated at hot-add. These are patches for it.
This patch is for 2.6.17-rc3-mm1.
Please apply.
------------------------------------------------------------
Change log from v4 of node hot-add.
  - update for 2.6.17-rc3-mm1.
V4 of post is here.
