This would be VERY usefull. Here, we're using chroot'ed apache servers
on Solaris and on Linux. For security reasons, the document root
is mounted from "outside of chroot" into "inside of chroot" with
read-only mode using lofs on Solaris, and it does the job.
However we can't do this on Linux, or we must use nfs ro mount from
localhost which is quite ugly, and much more slower as well I think ;-)
