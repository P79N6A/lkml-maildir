Recursion has nothing to do with it; as I said, the named on this
system is itself authoritative for all of the reverse lookups.
Turning down the DNS timeout would affect *all* name resolution on the
system, right?  That is not acceptable.
As I said, I already have a workaround, which is to have named log to
a flat file.  I agree that this is a poor workaround, and the "right
fix" is to modify syslogd not to perform blocking operations.  My only
quibble is that SOCK_DGRAM is an odd transport to use here, even over
AF_UNIX.

Yes.  We are able to log in to the machine eventually and restart the
offending processes.  But that is little consolation to our users who
notice the hang and the fallout afterward.
