Indeed.  To be honest, I think it's a mistake to have both libparted
and blkid.  OTOH, libparted isn't scaling down very well (yet).

Mainly because the code is structured for editing.  Editing is much
harder than just reading.  There is a lot more information to parse,
that you could otherwise throw out.  For example, you don't care about
partition names, or whether the partition has some magic flag to
allow it to boot on architecture X.
Also, since you must provide an incremental editing system when
editting, it is often easier to use this system when you are
parsing.  That means you can't get rid of the editing system when
all you want to do is parse.  In libparted, this includes a
constraint solver (about 7k), code to verify that there's space
for metadata, code to set partition types, flags...
In practice, all this code is hard to separate out, and it all
adds up.  Perhaps this is an argument for maintaining two sets of
partition code.  Feel free to look at the code, and decide for
yourself ;)
