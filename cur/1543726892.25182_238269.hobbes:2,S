You can send unified diffs to pciids@lists.sf.net and the robot
should automatically recognise them, and add them to the
"to be approved" queue. Then its just a matter of how long it
takes for someone with rights to approve entries.

upstream or not. Holler if you spot anything odd, and I'll try my
best to get changes to such entries approved quickly.
