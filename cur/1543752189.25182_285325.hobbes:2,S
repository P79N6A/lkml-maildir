Zero removes all bits so it's a special case.
As long as 1 bit is left coming from /dev/*random and not your
application, you're guaranteed that single bit to be random (since you
didn't mask it).
It's like if I read 100 bytes from /dev/random and then I truncate the
last 99 and it'll be as random as reading a single byte. Random means
all single bits are random too, not only the entire bytes.
