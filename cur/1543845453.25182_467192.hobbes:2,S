Actually some of the smarter ones wired it to the SMM indications in the
chipset so that only BIOS controlled SMM management code can do the
update and that does checksumming or basic very crude crypto type
checks.
Fortunately the thought of a slammer equivalent that erases the firmware
isn't something most vendors want to risk their stock price and business
on.
