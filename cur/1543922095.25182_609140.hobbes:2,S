If these 10 files gives you nightmares then poor soul ;-)
Anyway - the primary issue is the two defconfig files and the Kconfig stuff.
For defconfig we can inheritate the solution from powerpc where
the defconfig file is selected based on architecture.
Something like a
DEFCONFIG := defconfig_$(ARCH)
and then stuff them in configs/ directory.
The Kconfig stuff could be handled by special casing in scripts/kconfig.
We cannot just do the more obvious which is source the files since
they have conflicting choice symbols.
That could be fixed but requires a bit more work to do so - since we need
to track all relevant usages of the choice symbols and rename these.
We could also teach kconfig to allow duplicate symbols names in two choices
but Roman Zippel has not done that yet.
The Makefile stuff is trivial to merge.
The above is not preventing us - more what needs to be done.
