The Adlib card that I had was just an OPL-2 synthesizer, no PCM  
support at all. Normally, it was mono, 9 voices, 2 FM operators per  
voice + 3 noise channels, but there was a mode that supported 4  
operators and reduced the number of voices to 4 or 5.
An OPL-3 is just 2 OPL-2's, one for each stereo channel. I think that  
any card with an OPL-3 (SB-16) can act like an OPL-2, i.e. would be  
suitable for porting the driver. I really wish I still had my  
old .rol and .pat file collection; had a killer version of Bohemian  
Rhapsody.
