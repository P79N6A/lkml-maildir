I'm afraid doing so is not compatible with Andres' attitude (He is,
let's not forget this as he has stated to us twice and even with
attendance lists, A FULL VOTING MEMBER OF THE T-13 GREMIUM [1]. He is
sitting around with the big boys. From Microsoft, Intel, Sun and all
this BIIIG BIIIG $$$-companies. And Andre in their middle. They accept
him as one of theirs! Bow, small people, bow! Bow to Andre as _he_ has
full voting power. Not us.)
This, IMHO is, where the flame war comes from. Not from a technical
issue we basically all agree on. This is not on an exploit. This is on
attitude.
