This conflicts with the other reply you've made to me in this
thread where you say that you agree with me.
So which is it? :-)
I don't see why "enabling to 'y'" and "enabling to 'm'" are in any
way fundamentally different.  You're turning something on, therefore
something is going to change.
And when I see suggestions that we add four options to replace the
single one we have now, with a addendum saying "it's not really
complex, we'll explain it in the documentation", I want to pull my
hair out.
I would rather apply a patch that bloats up the structures than
subscribe to crazy ideas such as this four option one being proposed.
