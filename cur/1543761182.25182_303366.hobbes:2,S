being super lazy I'd type:
scripts/patch-kernel . ../Patches
nb it's currently broke as mentioned in another thread:
Re: [BUG] Re: [PATCH] scripts/patch-kernel: use EXTRAVERSION
being fixed though. It will (I assume!) embody whatever rules are needed 
to revoke patches to go from 2.6.11.5 to 2.6.12 (and since I think the 
new version has d/l facilities, that should assist in the case of a base 
kernel d/l of 2.6.11.3 for which no local patches exist to revert prior 
to patching to 2.6.12)
