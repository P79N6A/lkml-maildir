Well, you can make a copy of the existing kernel tree, and simply 
modify things in there, then "make modules_install".  Or you can make a 
link from the kernel tree pcnet32.c, to your own.
If you don't have space or permissions for that, you are pretty much 
SOL, I think. :-)
Ok, I kid you.  Put the driver somewhere, and type something like:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.19/include -Wall 
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common 
-fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 
-DMODULE  -nostdinc -I /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.95.4/include 
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=pcnet32  -c -o pcnet32.o pcnet32.c
Or whatever the actual command is that is output for the module when 
you build the unmodified kernel.
Then copy it to  /lib/modules/2.4.19/kernel/drivers/net/, or wherever, 
and "insmod" away.
