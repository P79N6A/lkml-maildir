File systems can be written so that implementations of read, lseek etc.
acquire a lock before using *pos, which precludes races. That was the
idea behind my patch. So, my patch does not necessarily cause races.
read instances can be racy in Linux now because there is no lock to
serialize read etc. system calls.
