	Had exactly this problem in SoftWindows on IRIX.  It would
fork to run some trivial external application, or a sound-process.  
It would die running out of memory (SWin mem image was often large).  
Solution was to convert to using
'sproc', where amount of process sharing can be user defined -- something
like a heavy-weight thread.  If all you were going to do was to exec
another proc, you could set the new proc to "share all mem":
    
PR_SADDR       All virtual space attributes (shared memory, mapped files, data
               space) are shared.  If one process in a share group attaches to
               a shared memory segment, all processes in the group can access
               that segment.
==
	Then do the exec call.  Thus no overcommit.
