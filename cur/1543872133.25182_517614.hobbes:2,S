Which of the two options below would be the best way 
to get around this problem.
i)A new ioctl call to set/unset lo_track_pgwrite.
ii) Create 'struct loop_info64_v2' with 
lo_track_pgwrite in it and two new ioctls LOOP_SET_STATUS64_V2
and LOOP_GET_STATUS64_V2.
Either way 'struct loop_info64' would be left untouched.
Please comment.
