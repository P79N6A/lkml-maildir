Ah, the old security through obscurity trick.

The whole argument against Unexecutable Stack that it only stops some
exploits and isn't going to stop all of them, could just as easily
be used against this solution: "It's useless now because sometime in the
future someone will find a workaround".

But since it stopped several attacks before it got useless, it hasn't been
wasted.

 `So you can count up to ...?' Susan prompted.
