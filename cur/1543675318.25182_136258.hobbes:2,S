   BTW it's a bit unfortunate that flush_dcache_page() is called for reads 
   and writes.
Please don't say it this way, this is an inaccurate description.
DMA-mapping.txt defines very precisely when flush_dcache_page() is
invoked, and that is it's only definition.  I purposely DO NOT say
that "this is for reads" or "this is for handling virtual aliasing
in L1 caches", I simply define where this macro is invoked and
that is it.
Specifically, flush_dcache_page() is called any time the kernel makes
cpu stores into a page cache page that might be mapped into a user's
address space.
