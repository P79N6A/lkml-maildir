What if there are existing applications which are deliberately or
inadvertently relying upon the current behaviour?  That seems unlikely, but
the consequences are gruesome.
If I'm right in this concern, the fixed behaviour should be opt-in.  That
could be via a new prctl() thingy but I think it would be better to do it
via a kernel boot parameter.  Because long-term we should have the fixed
semantics and we should not be making people change userspace for some
transient 2.6-only kernel behaviour.

Scares the shit out of me, frankly ;)
