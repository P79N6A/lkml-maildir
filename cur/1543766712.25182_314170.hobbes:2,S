This is also a problem at "normal" boot time.  BIOS may leave devices
still doing DMA if BIOS (or the arch equivalent) was using the device.
This problem is obvious for systems with an IOMMU (e.g. parisc).
See drivers/parisc/sba_iommu.c for an example of where I try to
deal with active DMA at boot time *before* PCI bus walks have occurred.
Masking IRQs is trivial in comparison to dealing with active DMA.

Same problem - just much more likely to hit the issue and completely
crash the box or corrupt memory.
