	David Gibson is the official maintainer of the Orinoco
driver. Pavel Roskin is the person that did most of the work on
0.15rc1+. I think it would be a nice idea to involve those two person
in such a discussion (therefore, cc'ed).
	The difference between 0.13e and 0.15rc1+ is not small. I
believe Pavel did a good job in splitting the various patches in small
pieces when adding them to the CVS, and David has tracked the kernel,
but reconciliating the two branches is no trivial matter.
	Jeff, does BitKeeper allow to merge patches at an earlier
point than the last version and reconciliate both branches ? That
might come handy.
	Good luck...
	Jean
