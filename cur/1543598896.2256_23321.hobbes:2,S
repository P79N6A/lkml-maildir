in such cases the solution is to elaborate, and not to

  i was sarcastic here. actually the fact is that
  4MB of tarred sources is more than 10 .c files
  doing the same thing 1.5x times faster.

  it is not an excuse to make things even worser.

  actually i meant that "i hardly can believe that
