Which full hostname? I have access to a machine with 2 NICs having 5
IPv4 addresses total, and none of the associated DNS records correspond
to the hostname.
And if I move a laptop from one foreign network to an other, I most
certainly do not want the hostname to change. It is the same machine
with the same name even if it's network address/domain is completely
different compared to what it was 5 minutes ago. It would make
absolutely no sense to include the current network address in the kernel
version.
Anything that assumes that the hostname has anything to do with IP
networking and DNS records is just utterly broken IMHO.
