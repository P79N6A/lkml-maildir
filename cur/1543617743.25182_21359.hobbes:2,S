Subject: CM8338 hissing sound with linux kernel 2.4.6 to 2.4.17

Good day!
I have the same problems with C-Media 8338A soundchip and the problem still exists with 
linux kerner 2.4.17 and even with 2.4.18-pre3.  Only wav files can be played with 
no noise, mp3 and ogg files produce noisy hissing sound covering a somewhat 
delayed music. I believe this is a kernel related problem.
Anybody find a solution to the problem? I found out that not only me have the 
same problem. I have tried testing several releases of the linux kernel hoping someone 
got it fixed with each release but still have hissing noise.
I've tried the generic 2.4.17 linux kernel, one with rml and another with mjc patches 
and still have the same hissing noise every time I played mp3, ogg files using mpg123 or 
xmms.  I can only play .wav files with no noise using xmms or the command line "play" program.
The system is a PII 400MHz 440BX with an Audio Excel PCI soundcard (C-Media 8338A chip, using the 
cmpci kernel module), with bt848 tv tuner (works fine with it's own audio out), 
Mandrake 8.1 distribution (all required software by kernel to compile are installed).
