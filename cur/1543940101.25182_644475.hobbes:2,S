If you're crazy enough to set up a software raid array on two firewire drives 
that end up contending for the fwX device, its much worse than simply having 
to unplug and replug though, since all hell breaks loose at the fs level and 
the array level.
We may have another issue there though, as when this happened to me, the md 
layer apparently never noticed (after ~6 hours) that one of the array members 
had disappeared -- not sure if that's firewire's fault or md's though... This 
will presumably avoid this situation entirely, but worth noting that there 
may still be somewhere we need to better communicate status to an upper 
layer.

Looks straight-forward enough, and I'll give these a spin shortly and see if I 
can reproduce the situation I was hitting with my raid array...
