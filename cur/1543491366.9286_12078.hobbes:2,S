But those were just done under SunOS, right? I wonder whether your
results reflect that tarfs is a very good idea, or that SunOS is
slow. This reminds me of the recurrent "let's implement swapfs for
Linux" thread. Swapfs is good for SunOS because SunOS is slow. Swapfs
for Linux is probably pointless because ext2fs and Linux are so fast.
Did you compare your tarfs with Linux+ext2fs? How does it fare?
What about linux+reiserfs? If tarfs is better, I'd be very
interested.
