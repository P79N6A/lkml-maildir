Ok, that makes the things clear, thank you.
After quite a lot of fiddling iwth google and git, I found what you 
are talking about here:
http://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg01592.html
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=cd28ab6a4e50a7601d22752aa7ce0c8197b10bdf
Somehow I missed it on LKML.
Unfortunately the machine with this chipset is  heavily used, so I 
am not very likely to get it off-line for testing.
Will have it in mind and try it if possible.
Kalin.
