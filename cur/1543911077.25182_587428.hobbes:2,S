Maybe someone sent it to stable@ and lkml at the same time and it got lost
on the second (noisy) path ? Judging from the patch, it got merged about
one month ago :
willy@pcw:2.6$ git log v2.6.20..2.6.22.x -- fs/9p/conv.c|cat

    fs: 9p/conv.c error path fix
    
    When buf_check_overflow() returns != 0 we will hit kfree(ERR_PTR(err))
    and it will not be happy about it.

But yes, I agree that it's very annoying when -stable contains patches
that are not in mainline. Fortunately, we have careful reviewers to
catch this when it happens !
