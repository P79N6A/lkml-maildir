Just since x86 is so popular.

It does. It DOES. IT DOES.

Yes. And then you should change kernel to accomodate changes in GCC, GNAT,
GPC, FPK and so on. No, thanks.

As far as kernel part is aware about them. Not about existance of trampolines
but about particular version of trampolines used in this and that compiler.

It was true then and it's true now. Yes, some trampolines works fine. Some
does not. Last thing needed in kernel is AI :-(

It does it only when not widely deployed :-)

If user is dumb he deserve to lose.

And it'll be true with or without subj.

Both stackguard and subj is "security via obscurity". It works. Until it's
widely deployed and all cracks are accomodated. So it works now EXACTLY since
it's not default option in kernel.

But you should patch and recompile kernel while trying to use new version
of GNAT or FPK or ... You got the idea. To me such things do not belong to
standard kernel.
