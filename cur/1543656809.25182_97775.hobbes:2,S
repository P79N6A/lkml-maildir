No need to sugar-coat anything :-)
Natalie is the engineer who added support for the ES7000 to Linux.
Fortunately she is in the cube next to me.
She has sent the patches to SuSe/United Linux, and is in the final process
of testing them on 2.5.5x before submitting them to LKML for comment.

I mostly work on our 16-32p IA64 machines.  Natalie or someone else will
have to comment on the clustered-apic code.
I do know that a lot of the code for the ES7000 is optional, and only
required to support value-added management functionality, which is
especially useful if you are running more than one OS instance on the
machine (it supports 8 fully-independent partitions).
Also, as a clarification, our 32-processor systems are NOT NUMA: there
is a full non-blocking crossbar to memory.  So clustered APIC support
should not be dependant on NUMA.
