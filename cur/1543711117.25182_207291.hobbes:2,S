Subject: [PATCH 2.6][RESEND] fbcon margins colour fix

I sent it a few times to linux-kernel and at least one to
linux-fbdev-devel, but haven't seen any comments - and this annoying
changing margins colour seems to be still there in 2.6.4 (at least on
tdfxfb).

This fixes "margin colour" (colour used to clear top and bottom margins -
e.g. remaining half of line at the bottom of 100x37 console on 800x600
framebuffer).
I don't know what was the intention behind using attr_bgcol_ec() here,
but it caused using of background colour of last erase character to clear
margins (thus it was changing from time to time when switching consoles
or so).
I think that margin colour should be equal overscan colour, which seems
to be always black.
This patch changes margin colour to black (or colour 0 in palette modes)
in accel_clear_margins() and removes unused then bgshift variable.
