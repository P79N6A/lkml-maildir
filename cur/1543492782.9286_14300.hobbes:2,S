Thanks for the answer on preemptiveness.  In retrospect (now that
I have the answer) I realize it was probably a dumb question.  Where
is the best source of information on kernel threads?  There isn't
much discussion of them in the source code.  I am interested in
how they are scheduled - it appears they are running at a very high
priority.  It also appears that they are normal processes in the
view of the scheduler as I can not see any special code to handle
them in kernel/sched.c.  Am I free to alter the priority of a kernel
thread?
