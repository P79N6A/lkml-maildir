Since all of the discussion here has been around "standard" UARTs.....
I know Russell mentioned this, and it has been discussed in the past,
but I'm most interested in being able to include non-165xx style UARTs
in the /dev/tty<something>.  Systems may be exclusively non-165xx UARTs,
or a mix of both.  The problems to solve are drivers fighting over minor
device numbers and assumptions about the system console.
Thanks.
