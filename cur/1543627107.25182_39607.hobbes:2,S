Or: few fbdev applications expect a correct behavior.
IIRC XF68_FBDev also saves/restores the palette itself.

In general, this is not correct, since no one guarantees that in e.g. depth 32
the alpha bits are in the 8 most significant bits of the pixel value.
But in directcolor mode XORing with the 16th entry of the pseudo palette should
be OK. So yes, I guess we (cfr. the CC to linux-fbdev-devel) would take a
patch for that...
That's why for 2.5.x we plan to add a 17th entry to the pseudo palette, so the
fbdev can specify the correct XOR value.

Yes, but fbcon-cfb8 does the right thing for pseudocolor modes only :-( There
does exist non-pseudocolor depth 8 hardware (e.g. RGB332).
