I think you meant fadvise.  That is certainly a possibility which we
need to work on.  Current implementation of fadvise only throttles
read ahead in case of sequential access and flushes the file in case
of DONTNEED.  We leave it at default for NOREUSE.
In case of DONTNEED and NOREUSE, we need to limit the pages used for
page cache and also reclaim them as soon as possible.  Interaction of
 mmap() and fadvise is little more dfficult to handle.
