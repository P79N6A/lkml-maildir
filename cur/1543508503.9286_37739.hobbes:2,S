This is from the LinuxThreads README file:
KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS:
- Threads share pretty much everything they should share according
  to the standard: memory space, file descriptors, signal handlers,
  current working directory, etc. One thing that they do not share
  is their pid's and parent pid's. According to the standard, they
  should have the same, but that's one thing we cannot achieve
  in this implementation (until the CLONE_PID flag to clone() becomes
  usable).
When does the CLONE_PID flag to clone() becomes usable? 2.4.x? 2.5.x?
