I really hate this whole /proc/<pid>/numa_policy thing. /proc/<pid>/maps
was imho always a desaster (hard to parse, slow etc.). Also external
access of NUMA policies has interesting locking issues. I intentionally
didn't add something like that when I designed the original
NUMA API. Please don't add it.
