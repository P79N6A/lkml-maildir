Here is the commit in question:

While the architecture in my mind is clear, I cannot do this myself
(and for all drivers).  Such a change would be gradual, involving more
than one developer, for more than one (new) driver, etc.
First we need SDI to make everyone happy.  This way HP/LSI/Adaptec
can move quickest to the customers with minimal pain to the customers
and to the companies which would have to change software (minimal change).

Ok.

Ok.
