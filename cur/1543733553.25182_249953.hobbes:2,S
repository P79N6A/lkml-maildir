"..." is pretty good, but I think it has been used by others, but I 
really forget who.  I could live with "...", but I think "metas" and 
"..metas" will collide less often.  Apparently Meta is a finnish name or 
something, so Linus does not like it.  The exact string is really not 
very important to me.  I agree that "..." is elegant.
