Hi,
Are there any "official way" to detect that APM or ACPI is active?
With APM I try it and it works:
#ifdef CONFIG_APM
#include <linux/apm_bios.h>
#endif
...
#ifdef CONFIG_APM
if (apm_info.disabled >= 0) {
                printk(KERN_NOTICE "Real APM support is present.\n");
}
#endif
Are there any similar for ACPI?
Thanks,
Peter
