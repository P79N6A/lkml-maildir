There was none.
Dan Muntz's question:
  Solaris has had CacheFS since ~1995, HPUX had a port of it since
  ~1997.  I'd be interested in evidence of even a small fraction of
  Solaris and/or HPUX shops using CacheFS.  I am aware of customers who
  thought it sounded like a good idea, but ended up ditching it for
  various reasons (e.g., CacheFS just adds overhead if you almost
  always hit your local mem cache).
was an very very good one.
Seems that instead of answering it, we've decided to investigate the
fate of those who do not learn from history.
