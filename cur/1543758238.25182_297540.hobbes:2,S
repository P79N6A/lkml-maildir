There seems to be quite some difference between module and 
built-in for framebuffer drivers. Quite some time ago I 
reported a problem with nVidia framebuffer driver making the 
screen go nuts or simply blank (but no lock-up; could still 
blind type). I finally discovered that the problem only 
happened when the driver was compiled as a module.
