pgcl doesn't reduce userspace's mapping granularity. The current
implementation has the same pte_chain overhead as mainline for the same
virtualspace mapped. It's unclear how feasible it is to reduce this
overhead, though various proposals have gone around. I've ignored the
potential pte_chain reduction issue entirely in favor of concentrating
on more basic correctness and functionality. The removal of the 1:1 pte
page : struct page assumption is the vastly more important aspect of
anobjrmap in relation to pgcl, since removing that assumption would
remove a significant piece of complexity.
