Our ACPI looked very similar to yours, so I've disabled IRQBALANCE.
We'll be rebooting the server during a less busy time to try the new
kernel, so not for about 12 hours or so.

Great, thanks for that.  I've had a look through and I think the
IRQBALANCE issue is the most likely cause.
We're also applying the attached patch.  There's a bug in reiserfs that
gets tickled by our huge MMAP usage (it's amazing what really busy
Cyrus daemons can do to a server, ouch).  It's fixed in generic_write,
so we take the few percent performance hit for something that doesn't
break!
