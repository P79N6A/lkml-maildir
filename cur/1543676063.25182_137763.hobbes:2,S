I used:
 $ httperf --rate 1000 --num-conns 1000000 --verbose --hog --server HOST \
	--uri pathto30KBfile
on 3 clients (for a total of 3000 conns/sec).  You can't go higher
than 1000 conn/sec per client (IP address) because otherwise you run
out of port space (due to TIME_WAIT).
This load worked well for a machine with a single GigE card.  All
network tunables were on the default setting (in particular, the tx
queue len was 300, which is were the losses came from).
With this load, I saw bad RTT values in the route cache within a
couple of seconds after starting the third httperf generator.  It then
took a bit longer (on the order of 1-2 minutes) until the first
TCPAbortFailed errors started to pop up.
