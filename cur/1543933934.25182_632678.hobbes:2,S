hm, i agree with this change, but would it be possible to split this up 
into gradual steps, to change the rules on 64-bit one by one? That would 
make it much more bisectable. In our experience changes to the link 
order have a high likelyhood of breaking stuff, as we've got so many 
implicit initcall dependencies that are not explicitly spelled out.
