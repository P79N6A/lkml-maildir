Ok, tell that to my SBLive that absolutely loves jumping and jittering
on my SMP box under Win2k. Creative have been notified. Ever since they
released their first driver for it...
So if they would've had their driver out in the open I'm sure SOMEONE,
if not me, would've squashed the bug already.
So you're right, good commercial drivers don't need fixing.
Also, good open-source drivers don't need fixing.
Good drivers don't need fixing! Of course they don't!
But crap coding is crap coding no matter what license/distribution form
you put it under, be it open source, closed source or whatnot.
