Yes! This was the most desired item by people which is why I made sure it
was the first thing to be implemented (it also happens to be the easiest
thing to implement as it doesn't involve any changes to metadata at all). 
I consider that completely stable although there have been some reports of
hangs but I have never seen one and everyone who has filed a bug report
wasn't able to reproduce the hang on request so I am not really sure where
the hangs come from... It might not even be the ntfs driver per se but a
bad interaction between ntfs and some other kernel subsystem like the mm
layer or the block layer. But I have only seen three reports of a system
freeze so far and Mandrake who ship the new driver I would assume have
more users than that and either they are not complaining or they are not
having problems. I hope the latter. (-;
In any case, even if there is a bug somewhere which causes the kernel to
hang, no damage to the ntfs partition will occur from the new driver as it
is now. It simply doesn't modify any metadata at all so it can't cause any
damage.
Best regards,
