Thank you. I will take it as a complement and likely laminate this
email for your suggestion that I've acted responsibly in my
maintenance of ltt. Boy, can you imagine what this debate would
have looked like if I had included precisely those additional
projects ...
C'mon Jes, if I was able to responsibly maintain ltt over 5
years *out* of the tree and I'm being labeled as incompetent all
over this thread, then imagine what the very competent people
maintaining the kernel could actually do.
