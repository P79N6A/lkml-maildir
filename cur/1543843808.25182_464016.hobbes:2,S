you are wrong if you call my asking you to retract your false suggestion 
and false accusation a "word game". It is my basic right to point out 
misrepresentations, false statements, false accusations and 
misinterpretations when i see them. The sentences i pointed out were not 
just opinions, they were materially false statements of yours. But you 
are of course free to not retract or correct them (or to not dispute my 
characterization of them as such).
