As all this is trying to avoid bus turnarounds (i.e. switching from
reading to writing), wouldn't it be fastest to just trust that the CPU
has at least 4k worth of cache? (and hope for the best that we don't
get interrupted in the meanwhile).
void copy_page (char *dest, char *source)
{
	long *dst = (long *)dest, 
		*src=(long *)source, 
		*end= (long *)(source+PAGE_SIZE);
#if 1
	register int  i;
	long t=0;
	static long tt;
  	for (i=0;i<PAGE_SIZE/sizeof (long);i += cache_line_size()/sizeof(long))
	/* Actually the innards of this loop should be:
		(void) from[i];
	   however, the compiler will probably optimize that away. */ 
     		t += src[i];
	tt = t;
#endif
	while (src < end)
		*dst++ = *src++;
}
So, this is 15 lines of C, and it'd be interesting to benchmark this
against the assembly.
I'm assuming that the "loop variable handling" is not going to
influence the overall performance: that would run at 500 - 1000MHz,
and around 1 clock cycle (1-2ns) per loop. Set this against the stalls
against the memory unit whose output buffer is full, and memory writes
that take on the order of 30 ns per 64bits.
At least, that's what I expect, however, I haven't been optimizing
cycles for quite a while....
