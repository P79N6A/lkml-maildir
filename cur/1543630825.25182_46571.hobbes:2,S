Here's the entry for it from lspci -v.  I can quote the entire file if you prefer.
00:11.0 RAID bus controller: ARALION Inc: Unknown device 0301
        Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, slow devsel, latency 32, IRQ 10
        I/O ports at ac00 [size=16]
        I/O ports at b000 [size=16]
        I/O ports at b400 [size=16]
        I/O ports at b800 [size=16]
        I/O ports at bc00 [size=16]
        I/O ports at c000 [size=8]
        Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=64K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 1
However.  I put the thing in to try and relieve a problem of drive bays and
connector lengths.  A bit of lateral thinking has provided another solution
and I no longer need the card urgently.
