	Yes, FreeSWAN is the answer here.  That is what I mean with
	that 'will appear soon' thing.
	Installing it into pre-packaged system distribution isn't all
	that hard, but it does require a bit more than novice system,
	and kernel hacker skills at the moment.
	If the Dan Bernstain's crypto source code suite against US
	Federal Government goes thru, then at least *he* can publish
	crypto source in web in USA.  (No more on this topic here, please.)

	IPSec AUTH, or  IPSec ENCRYPTION ?
	AUTHentication means the data traffic in itself goes in plain,
	but each packet contains a digital signature protecting it, and
	guaranteeing its authenticity.
	AUTHentication can be produced and exported without limitations,
	ENCRYPTION is entirely another container of wriggly things...
	Of course they do it with closed specifications and binary only
	distributions, so the problems related to *source code* export
	don't affect them...
