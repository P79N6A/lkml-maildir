For what it's worth, running with a 512k receive buffer still caused the 
clamping to occur, though it took longer than with the normal buffer size. 
The window went down from a maximum of 12291 (times 2^4 due to window 
scaling) to 3190 currently. That's still enough for our purposes, but I'll 
keep monitoring it to see if it shrinks any further. It could be a viable 
work-around for the time being.
Is this a bug, though, or a feature? :)

Correct. I noticed too while experimenting that the clamping never occurs 
if the application is fast enough to keep the socket buffer empty. It's 
when data is allowed to accumulate in the buffer that the window shrinks, 
and then it never grows back, as if a portion of the buffer got lost 
permanently.
