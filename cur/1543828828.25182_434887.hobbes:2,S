Not really - it's not my system and I'd need to monkey around and generate
a diff which I then cannot test.
The driver you have there (REL_2.0.14.5152_LX.tar.gz) doesn't actually
appear to fix the bug:
int s2io_open(struct net_device *dev)
{
	nic_t *sp = dev->priv;
	int err = 0;
	/*
	 * Make sure you have link off by default every time
	 * Nic is initialized
	 */
	netif_carrier_off(dev);
	sp->last_link_state = 0;
	/* Initialize H/W and enable interrupts */
	err = s2io_card_up(sp);
	if (err) {
		DBG_PRINT(ERR_DBG, "%s: H/W initialization failed\n",
			  dev->name);
		if (err == -ENODEV)
			goto hw_init_failed;
		else
			goto hw_enable_failed;
	}
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_MSI
	/* Store the values of the MSIX table in the nic_t structure */
	store_xmsi_data(sp);
	/* After proper initialization of H/W, register ISR */
	if (sp->intr_type == MSI) {
		err = request_irq((int) sp->pdev->irq, s2io_msi_handle,
			SA_SHIRQ, sp->name, dev);
It's still calling request_irq() _after_ "enable interrupts".
