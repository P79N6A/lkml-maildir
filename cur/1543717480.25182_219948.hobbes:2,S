Human readable is nice.
The identity mapped kernel space is not limited by the pagesize.
Mappings in region 7[*] are provided by the Alt-dtlb miss handler,
which just inserts a kernel granule sized mapping into the TLB
to cover any TLB miss.

[*] except for the percpu area in the top 64k of region 7 which is
mapped by a locked entry in a DTR register.
