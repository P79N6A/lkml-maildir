but there is no need to change the kernel-userspace interface. it is just
the __KERNEL__ part that has grown, having different kernel and userspace
lv_t and just converting between them should be enough. this will hopefully
make the interface more stable too. anyhow its broken as it is in 2.5 right
now, with (sizeof(lv_t) in kernel != sizeof(lv_t) in userspace) when the
tools expects it to be. 
it would be nice to be able to use the same tools in 2.4 and 2.5 and i don't
see any reason it shouldn't be possible.
i'm thinking about something like this:
userspace uses lv_t which is about 240 bytes, kern space uses its own _huge_
klv_t and the ioctls converts between them. then we can go adding stuff into
the klv_t without worry.. klv_t could begin with the lv_t so converting it
for sending it to user is simply a cast. getting it from user involves
validating it the convertion almost be in place already.
good that we have uml in 2.5 again so i don't have to be afraid to trash my
laptop disk.
