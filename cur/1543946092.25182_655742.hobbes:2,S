Could you use the tools found here:
http://www-user.rhrk.uni-kl.de/~nissler/rt2x00/index.html
and capture all TX/RX frames going through the hardware?
Note that after the failure, this dumping facitilty should still report
any ping request you might send to the interface.

I have a series of tests I would like to request from you,
you mentioned you already enabled debugfs, and that is just what we need. ;)
Please use attached script to create dumps of the hardware register contents.
There are specific moments that should be dumped:
- kernel 2.6.24 (last known working version for you).
- kernel 2.6.25-rc2 (after ifup, before TX dies)
- kernel 2.6.25-rc2 (after ifup, after TX dies)

Above traces should be enough, but to determine where rt2x00 broke
down approximatly I need to have a few test result on specific moments.
Could you test the kernel with the following versions:
rt2x00 2.0.11	2d68de3efa62655d551092f5c787505735d561ad
rt2x00 2.0.12	a3c7aa58df7df80aa05f166fe3e42482247164cf
rt2x00 2.0.13	5a6012e105ae1664cd2841c33bf59fbdd8d4dbcc
Checking those out is simply a matter of:
git branch 2.0.11 2d68de3efa62655d551092f5c787505735d561ad
git checkout 2.0.11
No further bisecting is needed, but with above tests I can at least
narrow it down to find the cause of this issue.
Thanks.
Ivo
