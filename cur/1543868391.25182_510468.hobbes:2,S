mmc_rescan
  mmc_register_card
    device_add
      mmc_block_probe
        mmc_block_alloc
          -> queue thread starts running
        add_disk
          -> issues a lot of requests; card fails, my drivers calls mmc_remove_host, which in 
             turn calls device_del, though we are still in device_add
