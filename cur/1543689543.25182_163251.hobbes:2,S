Joe User got IPV6 from his vendor as a standard component, and if he
didn't the large number of app patches his old distro need outweigh the
kernel.
However for drivers its the same - its a _source_ level interface.
For example 
	spin_lock(&lock)
compiles to different things for uniprocessor/SMP kernels and the
difference is worth real speed. So your binary interface roughly
speaking depends on
-	core options selected
-	compiler (gcc2 v gcc3)
-	SMP v UP
-	Highmem v non highmem
-	CPU target type
-	4G/4G split in 2.6 case
and a few more, while your source interface is pretty stable.
So what does that mean for someone adding a module
1.	It needs compiling
2.	If you want trivial end user ease then you need to wrap the
compilation up as part of the stuff the user never sees.
