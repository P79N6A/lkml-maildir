Limiting is:
- I want to do A.
- I won't let you do that.
But you don't want convert and write integer attributes directly to
sysfs.
If you do so, class will end up converting everything back from
strings to integers (as in _leds case. And another example, though
bad one, is drivers/power/apm_power.c).

When properties are pure integers why you so eager to fill sysfs by
yourself?
You don't want to pad "voltage" property with zeroes. Probably you
want free-form S/N property. Ok, it fits quite well in the purposed
scheme: fill strval.
Can you imagine an use case when this approach doesn't work?

No, we don't need strval for every property. Most of them are integers,
and power_supply_sysfs.c doing its small job: representing internal
structure to sysfs, through strings. Strings aren't there in the
first place.
