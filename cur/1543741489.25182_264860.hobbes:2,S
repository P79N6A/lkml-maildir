Firstly enable lvm debugging.  lvm.conf: log { file="/tmp/lvm2.log" level=7 }
Compare the lvm log files for the kernels to see where it's going wrong.
Then take complete straces (incl. read/write data) of the lvm process 
with each kernel and again compare them. [Or put files on web and send URLs.]
[To check for repeat of old problems with related symptoms:]
  Were both kernels compiled with the same compiler version? Which version?
  Does it make any difference if you rebuild lvm with --disable-o_direct?
