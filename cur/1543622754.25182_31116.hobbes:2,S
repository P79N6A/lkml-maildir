The card should (must) share the PCI interrupt with the CardBus bridge
device.  However, the IDE driver assumes that it should have exclusive
use of the interrupt, because it doesn't believe that this is a PCI
IDE device (well, it is sort of an ISA IDE device sitting behind a PCI
bridge).

The ide_cs driver does call ide_unregister().  The problem is that the
IDE driver doesn't clean up properly if you hot-eject an interface
that has active devices associated with it.  Use "cardctl eject"
before you eject an IDE card.
