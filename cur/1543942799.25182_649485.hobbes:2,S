Hi Sven,
I have no problems with the spirit of this patch, and the range checking
seems good to me.  Though I wonder if 2000 might not be an exessively
low maximum.  I can't think of a usage case off-hand, but I'm not sure I
understand why a user shouldn't be able to set it to much (rediculously)
higher values.
In any case, thats not a big deal.
