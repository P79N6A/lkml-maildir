Subject: [PATCH 2.6.18-rc6 00/10] Kernel memory leak detector 0.10
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a new version (0.10) of the kernel memory leak detector. See
the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more detailed
description. The patches are downloadable from (the whole patch or the
broken-out series):
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/patch-2.6.18-rc6-kmemleak-0.10.bz2
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/broken-out/patches-kmemleak-0.10.tar.bz2
What's new in this version:
- replaced the pointers radix tree with a hash table to avoid the
  locking dependencies caused by the radix tree memory allocations
- fixed locking dependency problems by no longer holding the
  memleak_lock when allocating/freeing memory from kmemleak and also
  using RCU
- changed the naming of tracked memory blocks from "pointer" to
  "object"
- code clean-up
To do:
- testing on a wider range of platforms and configurations
- support for ioremap tracking (once the generic ioremap patches are
  merged)
- eliminate the task stacks scanning (if possible, by marking the
  allocated blocks as temporary until the return to user-space -
  Ingo's suggestion)
- precise type identification (after first assessing the efficiency of
  the current method as it requires changes to the kernel API)
