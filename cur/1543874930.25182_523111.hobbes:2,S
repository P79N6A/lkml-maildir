According to the dmesg output, the local apic is disabled in the BIOS on
this system, and I'm not booting with "lapic" to enable it.
Anyway, the "few hours" turned out to be more like a few minutes :-).
The patch worked as far as selecting/installing the acpi_pm clocksource
instead of the pit clocksource, and there was no hang during boot.  If
you would like to see the dmesg output, let me know and I'll forward it
to you in a separate message.
