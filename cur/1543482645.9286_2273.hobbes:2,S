I have a couple of very basic questions about Alan Cox's ac-series kernel
patches - I've searched for but can not find any FAQ documenting this specific
phenomenon. Since many of you will know the answers to my dumb questions I can
avoid inflicting my worthless email on the great bearded one himself...
1) How should the 2.2.0-ac1 patched kernel be regarded? As a 'fixed' production
kernel, or as an experimental or development kernel?
2) How do you apply the 2.2.0-ac1 patch correctly? I rooted my 2.2.0 source tree
at /usr/src/linux.vanilla, did a cd to /usr/src, then did
    cat whatever/patch-2.2.0-ac1 | patch -p0 2>&1 | less
It didn't barf, and it did seem to update the source tree in linux.vanilla, but
it also created a new (smallish) directory hierarchy in /usr/src/linux.ac.
Why? What is it? Do I ignore it or do something with it?
Kind respondents please email me at the address given in the header and below; I
don't subscribe to this list as I'm on too many high volume lists already.
Regards to all,
Ralph Clark
