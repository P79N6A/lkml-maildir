Hi,
Here is my current version of the NTP patches.
They precalculate as much possible and get rid of a lot of rather crude
compensation code. The tick length is now a much simpler value, updated
once a second, which greatly reduces the dependency on HZ.
I rebased the patches against current -mm + John's ntp.c patch.
bye, Roman
