Today I got 66 unkillable 'autologout's. They were not zombies but could
not be killed. ps fax showed no parent.
I tried
killall autologout
killall -9 autologout
kill <pid>
kill -9 <pid>
but they all failed.
I then rebooted the box since I had to get sendmail back (refused to work
with load 66).
top showed STAT=D on all 'autologout's.
Seems like a bug to me.
(i'm not on the list, so CC to me)
