The main problem is the unknown BIOS support for the PCI configuration.
Maybe the manufacturer is at least willing to publish the default
configuration, so the PCI riser can be modified/fixed to the same
config. (Just call him and ask for the board designer... YMMV)
However, AFAIK this (re-)configuration can be done by the kernel, too.
(on embedded ppc platforms, the PCI mapping is done in the kernel)
At least from the electrical engineer's point of view it's not
difficult to modify a dumb passive PCI riser card to have the IRQ's and
REQ/GNTs routed and have the IDSEL soldered with 220 Ohms to the
proper AD line pin. (been there, done that)
(If somebody want's to mess around with that stuff, contact
me off list, it's getting OT here.)

True. It might be more easy to get that running, hoping that
the BIOS enumerates the bridge right.
Kernel support shouldn't be an issue here as long as the
chip is supported.
