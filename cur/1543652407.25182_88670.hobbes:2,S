Number of loads = (total loads) * (kernel compile time) / (load run time)
And the load run time is impossible to fix because of the variable time it takes
to kill the load.
The load will be doing more work while the kernel is not compiling. Thus it will
always overestimate. At some stage I need to completely rewrite everything with
the ability of the load itself to know when to start and stop counting load
iterations; and I'm not even sure I can do that.
