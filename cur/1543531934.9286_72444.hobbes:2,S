You want to reserve up to the hard rlimit? That can be a LOT of memory per
process...
A malloc that touches all pages and returns zero on SIGSEGV is
an elegant solution for the heap.
Pre-allocating swap space up to the stack rlimit works, so long as the
kernel handles the case where the rlimit is increased. But this is a less
elegant solution, because you waste some resources in the common case.
I realize I'm splitting hairs here, and root is allowed to kill the
system... but root can increase his hard rlimit.
