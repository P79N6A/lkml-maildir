Someone other than Namesys maintaing the filesystem isn't the problem. XFS
for instance has had a lot of work done by non-SGI employees after it's
merge, but SGI doesn't release a new filesystem every 3 years with the
desire to remove and replace the old one. The main problems with reiser4
have been beat to death, if you don't get it by now chances are that you
won't. Having Hans and team run off to work on reiser5 6 months after
inclusion is an issue, since it seems to have happened before, but it's a
minor one as long as reiser4 is merged in a state where it can be manged by
other people without too much trouble.
