Yes it does, using Matt Bishop's classification.

I don't assume that.  I realize that there's the race condition on SMP
and, as pointed out by Andi Kleen, in many cases also on UP systems.
That's why I had the XXX comment in there from the very beginning.
This added check is not supposed to be relied upon; rather, it is a
hardening measure in case we miss a bug in underlying *getsockopt()
functions.

It depends.  You might have missed this description of a special case
where it does not appear to be possible to bypass the check:

Yes, the patch is highly controversial and I mostly agree with its
opponents (I had much of the same thoughts myself, except for DaveM's
concern that *optlen might be uninitialized or negative on purpose),
yet I am going to keep it in -ow.
BTW, I had previously submitted a very similar check to do_sysctl(),
also with an XXX comment, which got in a few years back.
I won't be surprised if one of these checks saves a system from a
compromise one day.  This world is not perfect - neither the rest of the
Linux kernel code nor vulnerability exploit programs are perfect.
