Ditto, with handcrafted simple scripts in my rc.d. About twice as long.
But that's not all... Game-test can't be run. I waited 4 minutes for it
to start the intro sequences (normally 10 seconds), clicked to load a
saved game, got neverending "sound repeats". Patiently logged in on a
text console and patiently killed the rouge processes. Took about five
minutes of starvation to squeeze in keystrokes with the few seconds of
interactivety now and then.
Rotating the world in Blender quickly "jerks", but now the pauses are
extended to more than 10 seconds (previously 1/2 to 2)
Ringing the bell and shouting "Unclean, unclean!"
