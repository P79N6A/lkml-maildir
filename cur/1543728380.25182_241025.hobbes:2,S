Hi,
i also want to say that some of the sprocadic xruns i see do also not
seem to be cause by latencies. The preempt timing reports i saw where
rather results of the xrun_debug reports i think..
How do i come to this conclusion? Well i have jack running w/o ALSA
xrun_debug reports but with preempt timing running for quite a while and
i see about the same number of xruns as before, but i don't see any
preempt timing reports anymore...
So i think jackd itself is doing some weird stuff. Or the driver of my
soundcard.
