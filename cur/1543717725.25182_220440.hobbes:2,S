Can you please generate a kernel profile?
Boot with the "profile=1" kernel command line option.
sudo readprofile -r
<close lid>
<wait 30 seconds>
<open lid>
sudo readprofile -n -v -m /wherever/System.map | sort -n +2 | tail -40 > foo
And send us foo?
Make sure that you use the System.map which corresponds to the
currently-running kernel.
Thanks.
