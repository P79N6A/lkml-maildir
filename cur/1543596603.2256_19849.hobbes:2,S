On a 32-bit architecture, Linux gives each user process 3GB of virtual
address space.  Into that 3GB address space you need to map your stack,
exectuable images, shared libaries, etc. with the rest left for the
heap.  If you need more memory in a single process you're better off
moving to a 64-bit architecture.  Note that multiple processes, as well
as the various caches can use the remaining memory.
