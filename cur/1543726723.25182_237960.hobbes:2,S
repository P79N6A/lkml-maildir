That's with NAPI on both. I notice r/wmem has an effect, but it's not much.
Although on my new computer it seems moot as there's something weird
going on with interrupts with my botherboard.

How does that make sense? When one side receives, the other sends, hrm?
They're two identical cards, it should be entirely symmetrical assuming
equal hardware - not faster on the years older hardware.

The celeron box is the server, that's the entire point. Anyhow, it's
much faster in transmission than my new computer right now due to said
mobo problem, so I *want* it as the server.

Sure, but I can tell you right now with reasonable certaintly that my
new computer
won't top 9000interrupts/sec, i.e. 9000 packets per second, and therefore do
the 12MB/s at most, and probably less; interruptwise, my new computer
is the bottleneck, and I'm guessing UDP is faster because TCP is
limited by the amount of packets, or in the other direction ACKs, it
can send per second.
Transfers to the celeron are a relatively pointless measure because
of my new computer being horribly interrupt limited at the moment. 
That may have started when I installed the gbit card, but mostly because it
disturbs the mobo's precious and unguessable hardware balance. I'll try figuring
out if I can solve it, but basically it just involves swapping around
cards until it
works better, so that'ld take a while.
Attached are the vmstats for an ftp and nfs transfer, as measured from
my old computer (the nfs and ftp server). Both were going at a pretty
low speed, sub-9000 packets; this may have to do with drive
fragmentation, my hard drives are rather full at the moment.
Also, the logs on the client (my new computer) while sending data to
my old one. These were made at a different time, and I believe the
transfer rate was better (6MB for ftp, 9MB for nfs) than for the
-to-old- logs, which were worse, and varied more.
