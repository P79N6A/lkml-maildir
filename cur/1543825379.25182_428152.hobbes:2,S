that used to be the case, but shouldnt happen anymore - with current 
lockdep code we always pass some string to the lock init code. (that's 
what lock-init-improvement.patch achieves in essence.) Worst-case the 
string should be "old_style_spin_init" or "old_style_rw_init".
So Mike please try the other patch i sent - it also adds a debugging 
check so that we can see where that NULL name comes from. It could be 
something benign like me forgetting to pass in a string somewhere in the 
initialization macros, but it could also be something more nasty like an 
initialize-by-memset assumption.
