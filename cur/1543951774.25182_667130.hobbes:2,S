UIO name and version are intentionally independent of module name and
version. It's meant to be an information for the userspace part of the driver
and should be set to values that are meaningful for it.

uio_register_device() will silently not register an interrupt if the number
is negative. This allows us to register a driver without interrupts. Hmm.
Maybe we should explicitly check for UIO_IRQ_NONE there and fail if a
different negative irq is passed in. Thanks for pointing this out.
But I agree, Ben should check if platform_get_irq() failed.

I agree.

Right. Maybe we should make uio_register_device a bit more verbose, too.
Thanks for your detailed review!
