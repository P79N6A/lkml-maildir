This thread has already gone on too long and I'm sorry to contribute to
it, but this is not correct. The leap seconds handle the correlation
between astronomical time and utc (so that the sun appears in the same
position on the sky at the correct time). Leap days handle the correlation
of our orbital position around the sun to dates.
