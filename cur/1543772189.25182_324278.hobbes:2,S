Ok, refaulting to current state seems pretty good. But you are not
going to see the messages after the resume; not in swsusp if they
happened after swsusp atomic snapshot. In recent swsusp, I'm carefull
not to blank consoles when I can avoid it, exactly so messages like
this can be seen.

*Maybe* flags telling drivers details of transition will be
needed. And I thought "partial suspend" people will want stuff like
char * "enter state with disk spinning at at most 300 rpm" to be added
there, too.
Now its mostly for typechecking.
