Yes. There are cases where hardware/BIOS can do C-state changes behind OS, with
things like be in C1 for a while and then go to C2/C3 after a while etc. In
such cases, there will be times when TLBs are not really flushed in hardware.
But ideally, if C3 results in deep idle TLBs would be turned off. And in cases
where we wake up earlier than expected, C-state policy should identify that
and choose a lower C-state next time around.
I also tried one variation of this, where in I only do flush if there are more
than one CPU sharing the mm. But, that did not help the test case I was using
(which is probably the worst case). What I would see is:
Process runs on CPU x and mm is not shared
Goes idle (C3) waiting on something
Wakes up on CPU y which will now start sharing mm
and would send flush IPI anyway
