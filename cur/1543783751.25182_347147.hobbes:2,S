Are you saying that you do not need to install ppp and compile (or install 
binary) kernel on other distros???

Maybe. But there were many bugs in modem_run, usbfs, usb drivers in 
kernel, ACPI, IRQ routing and so on. They caused modem_run to hang or do 
something stupid without even telling user what is broken. In my 
experience when one bug was fixed other appeared in the next kernel. So 
even if now everything works ok you have no guarantee that next release 
won't break something... :)

1. But you still use the kernel even with userspace driver. So it still 
can break forcing you to reboot.
2. I have no problems with kernel driver. All problems that I saw in the 
past were problems in other subsystems (usbfs, usb drivers, ACPI, IRQ, ...).
3. Restarting modem_run was never enought for me. I always at least had to 
unplug the modem from USB port. Or more often reboot. So I see no gain 
here.

But not device drivers. I do not think that Linux has good infrastructure 
for drivers in userspace (yes I know that there are some). Also are you 
sure that performance and latencies are ok with userspace driver even if 
system is under load?

Well, as you are saing it hasn't... :)  But since it is there and works 
for me I am interested in not changing this state without really good 
reason.
