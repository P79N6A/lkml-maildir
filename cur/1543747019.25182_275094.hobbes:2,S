The 'good' thing on ioctl is that _every_ device supports that. It
doesn't matter which device you open, each one supports ioctl.
Now if each driver cooks up it's own replacement.. and everyone
knows that developers don't really like to document their code.. :/
Was there ever a thread on lkml about a ioctl replacement? I'd
really like to read about proposals, so far everyone talks only about
replacing it... but no one wants to say how _exactly_.
