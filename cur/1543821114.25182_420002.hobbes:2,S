Thanks for your detailed review, Andrew.  Basically I just merged
genrtc's stuff, but obviously it seems there are lots of things to
fix/refine/improve.  I'll try to do but it will take some times.
Alessandro, following comments are against for this patch, right?

Since rtc_dev_ioctl() calls underlaying rtc driver's ioctl() first and
checks -EINVAL, so I think it will not conflict.  Is it wrong?
