Hi,
I am using big swap here (as a backing for potentially huge tmpfs). And I 
wonder why swapon on such big (like 12GB) swap takes about 7 minutes 
(continuous disk IO). Is this expected? Why it is like that? Can I do 
anything to speed it up? Or maybe remove it into the background with low 
priority or something like that?
Thanks in advance,
Grzegorz Kulewski
