Due to a horribly broken git merge, I was forced to rebase the sas-2.6 
tree against the latest upstream tree, rather than scsi-misc-2.6.
So, people interested in SAS and Adaptec 94xx, please pull from 'ALL' 
branch of
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/sas-2.6.git
to receive Adaptec's SAS & 94xx code, plus my layering and code 
duplication fixes.
Since it needs my bare minimum merge goals -- use scsi_scan_target() and 
put host template in aic94xx -- and since the upstream SAS transport 
class may require a few changes to fully work with a all-software SAS 
stack, I'm leaning towards pushing this sooner rather than later.
That will get everybody working on the same codebase, which providing a 
working driver for hardware that's already in the field.
