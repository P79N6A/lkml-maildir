    In my case, the same applied: the problem didn't seem to be a single
faulty component, but a combination. Since I finally wasn't able to
check in another computer where I could carry tests, or check under
windows in the same machine, I don't know if the problem was a faulty
device driver, a faulty motherboard, RAM problems (although memtest said
my RAM was OK), etc.

    I don't know why the heck this was causing problems, since any
electric noise that could be picked from the dangling cable shouldn't
affect neither the card nor the other USB ports, but...
