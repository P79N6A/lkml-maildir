Hi!
Does anyone else see this? I've already built a kernel successfully for
another machine, but this one gives me:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.19-rc3/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i486   -nostdinc -I /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-pc-linux-gnu/2.95.3/include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=rd  -c -o rd.o rd.c
rd.c:88: `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE' undeclared here (not in a function)
make[3]: *** [rd.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.19-rc3/drivers/block'
config appended.
Regards,
hjb
