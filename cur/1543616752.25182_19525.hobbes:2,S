The problem is that the "1GB" option doesn't cover 1 GB.
It is common for people to buy 1 GB of memory (power of 2),
and then complain that Linux only sees 896 MB of memory.
So how will you make the choices clear to such people?
There are 3 options, not counting the slram block device:
a. give up 128 MB (12.5 %) of memory
b. suffer the kmap overhead
c. give up some user virtual address space
None of this is obvious. The user sees "1GB" and will
innocently believe that this is good for a 1 GB system!
BTW, do we no longer require that the kernel side of things
(whole thing, including vmalloc space) be a power of two?
There used to be a bitwise operation in the user access stuff.
