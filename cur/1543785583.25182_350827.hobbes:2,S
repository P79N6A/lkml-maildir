it might be worth trying an updated 'mkinitrd'. The one currently in rhel4 
can currently do parallel 'insmod's, which might be causing this issue. 
See bugzilla: 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=145660
 
for more detail. This is fixed in U2, which isn't quite shipping yet, but 
in the meantime, I think you can get the updated package from the U2 beta 
channel.
