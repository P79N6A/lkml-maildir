Yes, as with my initial patch (like you, I had a semaphore in the
kernel).  However, with two separate syscalls, you don't need to
allocate anything in the kernel, and still know nothing about the
userspace locking.

Yep.  Exactly analogous to the kernel idiom (add to queue, check, sleep).
(Except the "waker dequeues us" microoptimization).

(Aside: I'm still reluctant to implement strict FIFO locks until
someone shows a starvation case in the current locks).
I thought about this a little.  If we add a flags arg to the
sys_uwaitq_wake() and make sys_uwaitq_wait() return the flags used by
the waker, and sys_uwaitq_wake return 1 if it woke someone...
	#define UWAITQ_PASSING 1
    up:
	ret = sys_uwaitq_wake(cookie, UWAITQ_PASSING);
	if (ret < 0) return -1;
	/* No waiters actually waiting? */
	if (ret == 0) {
		lock->counter = 1;
		sys_uwaitq_wake(cookie, 0);
	}
    down:
	sys_uwaitq_queue(cookie);
	if (atomic dec counter to 0) {
		sys_uwaitq_queue(0); /* unqueue */
		return 0;
	}
	ret = sys_uwaitq_wait(cookie);
	if (ret < 0)
		return -1;
	if (ret == UWAITQ_PASSING)
		return 0;
	goto down; /* spin again */
Rusty.
