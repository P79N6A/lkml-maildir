Hello,
I just added 2 external 1TB+ scsi devices to my i686 linux server
running 2.6.13.4 connected to external LSI MPT card.  fdisk and df both
show the sizes correctly (see below), but I'm worried that dmesg reports
them incorrectly.
SCSI device sda: 2460934144 512-byte hdwr sectors (160487 MB)
SCSI device sdb: 3790438400 512-byte hdwr sectors (841193 MB)
I don't think it's as simple as a variable overflow because both
sdkp->capacity and mb look to be cast as unsigned long longs.  I know a
workaround is to present less data per LUN, but I'd like to use it as
it's setup currently if possible.  Is this just printing incorrectly or
will I run into trouble when the device gets more full?
Thanks, 
Dale
