-preX are milestones mainly for developers
When -preX is converted to -rc1 then it defines feature freeze and the
testing / polishing steps to the final release take place, with "serious
bugfixes only" policy.
I know you think the -rc polishing is boring, so why don't you give it
to somebody else ? 
In fact the 2.6.x.y tree is a substitution for this. So the official
2.6.X release will be considered a real release candidate within no
time.
If this is your intention, then please state it loud and clearly and use
generally known and understandable naming conventions for it.

If you are referring to rc == "ridiculous count", I agree that it is not
your fault. Its not necessary to understand that.
If you refer to rc == "release candidate", please start to act in a way
which people _can_ actually understand without reading LKML and finding
the proclamation mail, in which you declare that ridiculous count should
now be considered as a release candidate.
There is no way to change common practice by proclamation.
