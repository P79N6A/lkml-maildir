yes, you are right - that difference was due to modutils versions.
However, a better way of finding the caller (thanks Manfred!) if to use -m
option of insmod. This shows all the eddresses I need so I discovered that 
the caller is bfs_find_entry() and after I looked at it I said in my heart
"behold, this is bad - needs rewriting".
But now the morning has started so I am back to real work and will
continue this investigation this evening at home.
Thanks to all who replied!
