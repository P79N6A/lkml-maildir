I don't believe there's a patch necessary here. The options shown at 
the prompt are computed by the conf program based on the current 
configuration. If he had a parent option set to 'm' that keeps this 
item from being set to 'y', then 'y' won't be shown as an available 
option. Changing the parent option will result in the child option 
having the 'y' choice available again.
