hello all ,
i have a bit of a problem ... i just got my hands on a sparcclassic
I stuck linux on it .. and i started recompiling the kernel to my
preferences..
well.... i dloaded 2213 and patched for ipsecmasq etc..
It took me a while to figure out there is no bzImage on sparc....
Ended up reading the Makefile....
but now it makes a vmlinux ...
i noticed the standard distro kernels come with a vmlinux or and a
vmlinuz...
Now how the heck do i get it to compress the kernel ...
there is no vmlinuz in the makefile ...
I d like to have a boot floppy of the same version i am running ( my custom
compiled one, not the distro one)
but the kernel uncompressed is like 3 megs ...
thanks in advance ,
Andrej
