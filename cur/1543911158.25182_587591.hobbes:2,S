I don't think we claimed we have the perfect system.  However, the
failure of anyone on this list to come up with a better one seems to
speak volumes about the difficulty of the problem.  If you have a
proposal, please make it ... otherwise simply griping about the current
system isn't going to change anything.

Then you're misconstruing the interactions.  A representational role
would imply the ability to speak for the community and make promises on
its behalf.  That, as Ted has already said, can't happen.  Instead, the
value to the LF is that the TAB contains people experienced in community
interactions who can act as a sounding board for what may (or may not)
be well received.
