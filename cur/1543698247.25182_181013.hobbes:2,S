Subject: how to reserve irqs at boot time

Hello, 
I'm running linux 2.4.20 and rtai 24.1.11. My linux
kernel module needs to use IRQ 9 10 11 for AGP graphic
card, sound card and PCI-Dio24 IO card. These irqs are
also shared by USB controllers. My module hangs when
it tries to request the above irqs used by USB
devices. I figured it would be a good idea to remove
this apparent conflict. I have scoured the web and
found that I can reserve these IRQs by specifying
pci=irqmask= on the kernel boot line.
I have tried to set "pci=irqmask=0xf1e8" to reserve
Irq 9 10 11 4 from my driver, and it hasn't had any
effect - those irqs are still used by usb controllers
on initialization. 
How do I reserve these IRQ's?  Is there some other
configuration file I haven't found? 
Thanks in advance,
jing
