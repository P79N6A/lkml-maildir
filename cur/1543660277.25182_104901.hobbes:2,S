Hi,
i was recently trying to use SIOCGSTAMP to get the date of the last packet
that arrived on the socket. like so:
	struct timeval tv;
	...
	ioctl(fd, SIOCGSTAMP, &tv);
Unfortunately no matter how i tried that i always got errno: ENOENT, which
is explained by `man 7 ip':
SIOCGSTAMP was called on a socket where no packet arrived.
Little browsing through the net/ipv4 dir showed that there is a macro
TCP_CHECK_TIMER(sk) that is being used around tcp.c, tcp_ipv4.c and
tcp_timer.c
More grepping showed that TCP_CHECK_TIMER(sk) defined in include/net/tcp.h
does absolutely nothing!
#define TCP_CHECK_TIMER(sk) do { } while (0)
The questions are:
1. Is this all really related?
2. Why is TCP_CHECK_TIMER not coded ?
Regards,
Maciej Soltysiak
