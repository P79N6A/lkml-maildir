Sorry, but I don't understand your objection. If AppArmor is configured
to allow everyone access to /bin/gzip but only some people access to
/bin/gunzip and (important detail) the single binary uses argv[0]
as documented and (another important detail) there aren't other links
named gunzip to the binary (ok, that's lots of if's) you should be fine.
I suppose you could make a shell that lies to exec, but the AppArmor
code could certainly check for that in exec by enforcing the argv[0]
convention. It would be perfectly reasonable for a system that is so
dependent on pathnames to require that.
