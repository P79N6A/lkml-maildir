Hallo, I have a problem with a dual processor machine. With Red Hat
2.2.19 kernel, but with every 2.2.1x kernel, from Red Hat or self
compiled, the machine hangs with lot of processes in D state:
vmstat output is
procs       memory    swap          io     system         cpu
 r  b  w swpd free  buff cache si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us  sy  id
 1 225 2   0  10632  10936  16456   0   0  6   3   14     9   6   3  14
The memory situation:
[root@petra petra]# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
cached
Mem:        523800     504688      19112          0      10620
31352
-/+ buffers/cache:     462716      61084
Swap:      2097136      35164    2061972
The box has 5 scsi disks with a aic7xxx controller. 4 disks are in RAID
1, the fifth is only used for the swap partition (2 GB).
When the machine hangs there are no logs.
Is there a way I can debug the cause? 
Thanks in advance,
andrea
