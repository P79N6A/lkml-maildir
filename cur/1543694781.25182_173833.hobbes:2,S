It certainly can temporarily (under load).
Try offloading some power strain by removing some peripherals (CD-ROM, 
non-mandatory disk drive) and see if it solves your problem.
I might be mistaken (don't know the exact behavior of drive electronics) 
but it seems unlikely that a bad PSU with underrated voltage could 
damage a drive (overrated voltage is another matter). Usually under spec 
PSUs fail to produce enough juice under load and the system simply 
becomes unstable.
