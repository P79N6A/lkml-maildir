I'm sorry, shame on me. It was an old one that I first showed as an example,
and I blindly resent without checking. I'll do my best to backport code in 2.6
on the next sleepless night.

It's an old trick I was used to, but at other places. Basically, it was used
to avoid syntax errors when the macro was not defined, which would lead to
(-0 == 0) which is valid while ( == 0) is not. But it appears that cpp handles
the case correctly so it's not needed here. I'll fix it too.
Marcelo, sorry for this quick patch, I'll better check what I feed you next
time.
Cheers,
Willy
