Ok, I'll be brutal, but remember, you asked :)
First off, read Documentation/SubmittingPatches and
Documentation/CodingStyle to see the proper way to make patches, and how
to format the code.

I need to be able to apply this patch by using a -p1 in the kernel
directory.  So the patch should be one directory up and look like:
--- linux-2.6.6/drivers/usb/serial/visor.c	2004-05-09 22:32:27.000000000 -0400

I'm trying not to add new stuff to the changelog at the beginning of the
file, but this is not really a big deal.

Wrong formatting style for the '{'
Your patch says that we might not have a read_urb for the given port?
How could that be true?  The check here in open() will catch any devices
that this might not be correct for.  So that portion of this patch is
not needed, right?

Um, we ask for a set ammount of data, and we should get it.  But we
should check the size of the data returned to make sure of this, right?

The call above to le16_to_cpus() will handle the endian issue here.
This comment can be removed.

I like the idea of this check, but you are trying to test for a negative
value on a __u16 variable, which is always unsigned.  So that check will
never be true :)

Now this is the meat of the patch.  Is that all that is needed, just
swaping the info?  That makes more sense than the hack of assigning the
same port data to both ports.  Does this work properly on disconnect
too?
Thanks a lot for doing this, with some cleanups I'll be glad to accept
this patch.
thanks,
