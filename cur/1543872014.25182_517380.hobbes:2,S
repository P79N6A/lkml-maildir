ug.  I've always disliked the kernel's dependence upon init to reap exitted
kernel threads.  It Just Seems Wrong.
But I'd have thought that this is really wart in nash - Linux simply
expects init to reap dead kernel threads, and as a Linux implementation of
init, nash ought to not misbehave in the presence of this logstanding
kernel behaviour.
