AFAICT from that documentation, it would have been better to unregister
the device on CPU_DOWN_PREPARE anyway.  CPU_DEAD seems to be too late -
it's already gone by then.

Is it possible to unregister a driver on CPU_DOWN_PREPARE_FROZEN?  If
so, then the simplest fix would be the patch below (Jiri: feel free to
try it). Otherwise it would take a bit of refactoring to bring the sysfs
interface down/up for suspend/resume.
