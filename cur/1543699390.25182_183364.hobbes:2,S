Uhm.. I was a bit too fast. It fixed the problem, okay, but it makes the
kernel spit out a lot of these messages:

Untill finally this last line makes my mouse stop working :( Won't help
unplug/replug, have to restart to make it work again.. I'm using the
ftdi_sio driver. It might be a problem with that, but since pppd won't
work without the patch, I don't know...
Best regards,
Stian
