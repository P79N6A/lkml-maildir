As you are adding sysfs files in /sys/firmware, please add documentation
to Documentation/ABI as to what these files are, what they do, what is
in them, and what they are to be used for.

This function, as well as the whole decl_subsys() stuff is gone in my
tree and in -mm.  /sys/firmware is now just a simple kobject that you
are free to chain off of.  If you describe just what these sysfs
subdirectories and files are for and how they are going to be used, I'd
be glad to rework this patch to use the new interfaces.
