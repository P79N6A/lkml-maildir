Here is simple fix (against 2.4.2, but can be easily applied to 2.2.18 too) for NBD, OKed by Pavel. It allows to use blocksizes other than 1024 
bytes. Without this fix, device with 4096-byte blocks has only 1/8 part accessible (and thus mke2fs fails, etc.).
To use NBD with variable blocksizes, you'll need updated nbd-client.c - Pavel should already have it in CVS, if not, take that from archive linked 
at 
http://fortunedirectory.com/aga/NBDServer.html
 (there is also my NBD server that stores and uses NBD device content compressed with 
ZLIB - on my current /usr/src, disk space usage is about fourfold smaller).
BTW, I've noticed quite a bit of speedup while using blocks 4096 bytes long, instead of 1024. I'd like to hear if you notice/measure the same 
thing.
