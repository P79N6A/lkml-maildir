Hi,
Yesterday I tried to install 2.2.17 on a pentium-mmx. Nothing fancy; 3c509,
3c905B, ide disk+cdrom, 32MB ram.
2.0.38 runs fine.
system crashes (hangs) after it decompressed the kernel, after the "Now
booting the kernel"-message.
I tried both an bzImage and the zImage.
Couldn't find anything in the FAQ on this.
What should I do as the next problem-determinationstep?
