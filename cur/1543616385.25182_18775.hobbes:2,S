What with mounting root via NFS, hence having to set up
IP et al, mounting various different
partition types, avoiding the kludge of fsck etc.,
being able to recover from a corrupted root, you
might as well just cpio up your /sbin and stick
that in, and be able to run single user mode without
a 'normal' root. <FX: ducks & runs>
seriously point: ls /sbin gives a /maximum/ range I'd
have thought.
