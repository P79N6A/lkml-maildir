null = 'do absolutely nothing'
generic = 'do D3 as per the specification'
The idea being the PM layer would go around calling
	dev->power_off(dev);
as a default notifier for PCI devices.

And in the case of the cards like that you would need a custom mask. So you'd
do
	pci_set_power_handler(dev, atyfb_power_on, atyfb_power_off)
to get a custom function. For most authors however they can call the power
handler setup just using prerolled functions that do the right thing and know
about any architecture horrors they dont.

I'd rather
	pci_dev->powerstate
or similar as a set of flags in the device.
