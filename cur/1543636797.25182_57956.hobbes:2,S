Good.
I have brought up a machine with a config similar but not identical to
yours and I am putting it through the paces (SMP+preempt machine).  I
really think you nailed this dead on - you did it right - we just need
to clean up the mess you left behind ;)
Ingo, looking over the FIXMEs in the tty layer I think they are
definitely _broke_.  At least some of these paths have no global
synchronization now.  Someone really needs to go through this cruft and
clean it up and do some proper locking.
