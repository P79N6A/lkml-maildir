I have an idea - it's just a stupid little idea, so don't bother telling me 
that.  I won't mention it further, but I just couldn't resist.  It's only 
partly tongue in cheek, as I think it may even work.  I'm not a subscriber 
and haven't read the list lately, so I apologize if I'm fanning the flames of 
any flamewar.
Add a sysctl to the linux kernel - /proc/sys/kernel/not-a-sco-distribution.  
Then it becomes an effective access control under the DMCA.  The kernel 
refuses to boot if any of the kernel developers decide not to license their 
code to SCO under the GPL, or hangs if it's set after booting.
If sco lies and clears it when it's to be set, then they are circumventing an 
access control, and liable for damages and criminal penalties under the dmca.
Possibly.  I'm not a lawyer.  But hey, if it works for the DVDCCA and other 
acronym organizations, why shouldn't it work for us, the legitimate copyright 
holders of the linux kernel?
