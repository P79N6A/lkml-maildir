I've seen this too.  It's ext3, possibly related to the singular
sleep_on_buffer() call failing to sleep.
Anton Blanchard has a cute patch which changes the kernel profiler to profile
calls to schedule() instead of just instructions and I have ported that to
ia32.  But I haven't got around to actually using it yet.
We'll get there ;)
