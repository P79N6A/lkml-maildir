Thanks alot ! The offending part was in the ALSA driver. It had selected Sound 
-> ALSA -> PCI -> Intel 18x0/MX440, SiS 7012; Ali 5455 ; NForce Audio; 
AMD768/8111 by default, which I missed when I built the kernel.
Even so, this ought not to hang the kernel ! I'm surprised there wasn't more 
interest in this from developers.. hangs are serious issues.
