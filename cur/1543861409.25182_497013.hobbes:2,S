It's just a manual version of probe_kernel_adress():
#define probe_kernel_address(addr, retval)              \
         ({                                              \
                 long ret;                               \
                 mm_segment_t old_fs = get_fs();         \
                                                         \
                 set_fs(KERNEL_DS);                      \
                 pagefault_disable();                    \
                 ret = __get_user(retval, [ ... ]);      \
                 pagefault_enable();                     \
                 set_fs(old_fs);                         \
                 ret;                                    \
         })
Doing the set_fs() and pagefault_{disable,enable} calls for every single 
byte during the checksum seems rather silly. The patch as posted has the 
set_fs() and pagefault_ calls only once in probe_roms() (as said when 
posted, I'm not sure the pagefault calls are still useful now that it's 
no longer a generic function/macro, but used directly at probe_roms() time).

I disagree I'm afraid. Given what __get_user compiles to (nothing more 
than a .fixup entry, basically) they're largely "free" and it makes the 
code completely obvious: "If you're touching this, do so via __get_user 
and not directly" and frees it from any assumptions, however reasonable 
or unreasonable.
Would you _mind_ if I submit it? If not, if you could comment on whether 
or not these pagefault calls are still useful, that would be great. The 
comment at probe_kernel_address() says:
  * We ensure that the __get_user() is executed in atomic context so that
  * do_page_fault() doesn't attempt to take mmap_sem. This makes
  * probe_kernel_address() suitable for use within regions where the
  * caller already holds mmap_sem, or other locks which nest inside
  * mmap_sem
This sounds like it might be nonsensical at probe_roms() time, but I'm 
not familiar with these virtualized environments -- I do not know which 
assumptions break.
Patch attached again for reference...
Rene.

    Use __get_user() for ISA ROM accesses.
    In virtualized environments, the ISA ROMs may not be mapped so be careful
    about touching them.
