hi
at 
http://lkcd.sourceforge.net/,
 there's a link to "Slides from the LKCD talk 
during LinuxWorld Expo 2000 (OLD)" 
(
http://lkcd.sourceforge.net/docs/linuxworld2000
), and "Slides from the Linux 
and RAS talk during LinuxWorld Expo 2002" 
(
http://lkcd.sourceforge.net/docs/linuxworld2002
), but all the slides are in 
microsoft powerpoint format. Anyone that cares to convert them into something 
readable?
roy
