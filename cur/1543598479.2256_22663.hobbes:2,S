I've tried to come up with an idea to automatically
benchmark user interactivity with the machine and
have put this idea in the Linux-MM wiki.
http://linux-mm.org/wiki/moin.cgi/UserInteractivity
If you have any comments on this proposed method or
would like to volunteer for coding it, please add
your comments in the wiki or respond by email ;)
regards,
Rik
