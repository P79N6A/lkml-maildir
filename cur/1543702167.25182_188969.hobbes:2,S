This is certainly not true. (well, maybe for a few device types).
Almost everything can be reached via a well defined bus (or more than
one bus). Each of them does obviously require an identifier. Thats the
hardware part.
Software tends to put a unique identifier into the 'logical' stuff, like
filesystem UUIDs.
So you can construct a unique device node for every device in the
system. And this will work even across distributions!
Stuff like sda3, mouse1 or dsp0 will obviously break. It just happend to
work because everyone on this list knows what to do and where to look.
Sure, there are exceptions, like 2 identical mice, or 2 identical USB
audio devices. But this cant be fixed.
