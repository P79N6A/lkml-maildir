Umm. Welcome to the 21st century: we don't do that "separate DMA 
controller" thing any more. All devices do their own DMA.

I'd much rather have five or even more functions that each do *one* 
obvious thing. 
Think like a device driver writer: would you prefer to just implement five 
functions that do something very specific that you know trivially how to 
do ("I know how to disable interrupts and DMA") or would you want to do 
some high-level opertion that you don't even know why the caller asks you 
to suspend? What does "suspend()" even mean when the caller is just going 
to wake up up immediately again? Is it performance-critical? Should I tear 
down all my DMA's? I dunno!
In other words, splitting things up actually makes things simpler. That's 
*doubly* true if you can then give each specific function some really 
clear goals.
