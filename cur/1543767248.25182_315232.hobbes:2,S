As you know, this is how I currently determine ownership of such resources as  
cluster snapshot metadata and ddraid dirty log.  I find the approach 
distinctly unsatisfactory.  The (g)dlm is rather verbose to use, particularly 
taking into the account the need to have two different state machine paths, 
depending on whether a lock happens to master locally or not, and the need to 
coordinate a number of loosely coupled elements: lock status blocks, asts, 
the calls themselves.  The result is quite a _long_ and opaque program to do 
a very simple thing.  It is full of long chains of reasoning, connected with 
the behavior of lvbs, asynchronous lock event flow, error behavior, myriad 
other details.  This just _feels wrong_ and the code looks ugly, no matter 
how much I try to dress it up.
And indeed, instinct turns out to be correct: there is a far simpler way to 
handle this: let the oldest member of the cluster decide who owns the 
metadata resources.  This is simple, unambiguous, fast, efficient, easy to 
implement and obviously correct.  And it has nothing to do with the dlm, it 
relies only on cman.  Or it would, if cman supported a stable ordering of 
cluster node longevity, which I do not think it does.  (Please correct me if 
I'm wrong, Patrick.)
So this is easy: fix cman so that it does support a stable ordering of cluster 
node membership age, if it does not already.

In my opinion, using the dlm to protect the shared storage resource 
constitutes tackling the problem far too high up on the food chain.

Good instinct.  In fact, as I've said before, you don't necessarily need a dlm 
in a cluster application at all.  What you need is _global synchronization_, 
however that is accomplished.  For example, I have found it simpler and more 
efficient to use network messaging for the cluster applications I've tackled 
so far.   This suggests to me that the dlm is going to end up pretty much as 
a service needed only by a cfs, and not much else.  The corollary of that is, 
we should concentrate on making the dlm work well for the cfs, and not get 
too wrapped up in trying to make it solve every global synchronization 
problem in the world.
