I believe it was broken by:
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=3b4c7d640376dbccfe80fc4f7b8772ecc7de28c5
I have seen this in the -mm tree, but didn't follow up at the time.  I
was able to fix it with the following patch.  I don't know if it's the
best fix, but it seems to follow the same logic as the original code.
The airo driver used to break out of while loop if there were any signals
pending.  Since it no longer checks for signals, it at least needs to check
if it needs to be frozen.
