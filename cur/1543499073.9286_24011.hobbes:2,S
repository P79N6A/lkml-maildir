  I get your point.  Still, it's inconvenient when you don't have an
ethernet card for your laptop and you want to SMB-mount that share full of
MP3s to load up before you hit the road.
  What doubly sucks is that my Win98 can't access the public read-only
samba share because of password problems and the EnablePlainTextPassword
hack doesn't do the trick.  But that's no fault of linux.

  Hmm, perl script on the horizon?  You'd have to be able to resend it with
the other computer's IP address.  Sounds like I'd have to read some RFCs
and research the spoofing code.  hoil!
