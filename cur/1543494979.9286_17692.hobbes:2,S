   Why is it all these kernel constants are not changeable from within
   the make proccess?
Some of them are limited in "hard" ways, for example the number of
user id's can't go above what can fit into a uid_t on a given
architecture.  Another good example is NR_TASKS which is limited to
some fixed constant currently on ix86 due to how the cpu descriptor
tables are setup in the kernel.  This later example we do have plans
to do away with, but in 2.3.x not 2.2.x
