Subject: upgrading with int'l patch

Hello friends,
I'm tried to upgrade my source tree to 2.2.4. As almost always, after I do
the patch I scan the tree for *.rej files. There was one:
../net/ipv4/ip_output.c. 
The reason for the reject was a area of code that the international patch
had inserted with #ifdef CONFIG_NET_SECURITY. The 2.2.4 patch overlaps
pieces of code here.
I like to alert other people for this and assume that the best way is to
keep the source tree clean and apply the (appropriate) international patch
as last.
Regards
Kees
