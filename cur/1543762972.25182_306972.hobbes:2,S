It gets better, in that the cpus themselves can reorder instructions. 
This becomes interesting when dealing with memory being shared between 
multiple cpus on SMP machines.  Either you need to use existing locking 
primitives which enforce ordering or else you need to use explicit 
cpu-level ordering instructions to ensure that data gets written/read in 
the expected order.  (See "mb" and friends in the kernel code.)
Then you get into potential caching issues with memory mapped at 
different addresses on cpus with VIVT caches, and that introduces more 
issues.
Computers are perfectly predictable, as long as you understand exactly 
what you've told them to do...
