I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that vdso itself can't be supported, but rather a
vsyscall that doesn't just wind up trapping into the kernel anyway.  Older
systems without a hpet timer to map into user space jump immediately to mind.
Arjan had mentioned a calibration on rdtsc as another alternative, which I had
not considered, so this may all be moot, but I was worried that a vdso solution
wouldn't always give the X guys what they were really after.
