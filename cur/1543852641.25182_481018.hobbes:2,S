That's no excuse, as Adrian pointed it out on LKML since weeks.
Also the kernel.org bugzilla has a real flaw:
There is no way to get informed of new entries automatically and
filtered by Category and Component. At least I did not find a way and
bugme-admin@osdl.org seems to be a black hole.
The result is that you have to go to bugzilla on a regular base instead
of getting automatic notifications of new entries. I do it once in a
while, but it is really ineffective.
