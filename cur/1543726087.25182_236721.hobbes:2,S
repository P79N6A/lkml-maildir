IMHO the out-of-line call to the rwlock contention code in the lock
section is completely worthless bloat and rwlocks should just call the
out-of-line contention case directly from the inline path.
The patch I used to determine the maximum aggregate text size
reduction achievable literally made normal C function entrypoints for
spin_lock(), read_lock(), and all the various spinlocking functions
for spinlocks and rwlocks, moving all of the spinlocking code from
include/linux/spinlock.h to a new kernel/spinlock.c, using the normal
inline _raw_spin_lock()/etc. to avoid unnecessary call frames. This is
what resulted in the aggregate kernel size reduction of 220KB, i.e.
almost 1/4 of 1MB, and had no effect on performance, positive or
negative, in some non-rigorous benchmarking. This obviously
interoperates quite well with backtracing and so on, but doesn't appear
to be under consideration at the moment, and may also have issues with
architectures (e.g. sparc/sparc64) which need the interrupt disablement
in e.g. spin_lock_irqsave() to be done in the same call frame as the
spin_unlock_irqrestore() etc.

This is a different issue. That should definitely be looked at for the
consolidated contention case out-of-line strategies now being
considered or others involving nonstandard calling conventions. IMHO we
are truly best off using normal calling conventions to invoke the
out-of-line cases regardless of their role. Confusing debuggers and the
extra bloat to push the return address on the stack and the extra jump
are just not worth it.
