After some more intensive Googling, I found the answer in the archives
of the linux-privs-discuss mailing-list (whose existence I did not
know of):

The explanation from the sendmail team was incorrect: CAP_SETPCAP is a
red herring, it's only about CAP_SETUID, the implementation of the
inheritable set was broken in that it controlled not only capabilities
automatically passed across execve() but also those _gained_ by suid
root programs (contrary to the claim in the sendmail analysis) and,
worse, instead of failing on execve() when the program could not gain
privileges, it proceeded with the capabilities missing.  Hence the
catastrophic failure.
This does not tell me, then, why CAP_SETPCAP was globally disabled by
default, nor why passing of capabilities across execve() was entirely
removed instead of being fixed.
