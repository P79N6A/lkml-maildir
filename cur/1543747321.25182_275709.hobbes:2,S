I want(ed) to find out which I/O port to use for inb() and stuff, and using the
BIOS's provided data. If you are referring to "ports", I could not find a
device node, but "port" maybe:
$ tailhex /dev/port
[...]
0x00000400 | ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff |
[...]
Oh, look what /dev/mem found! (I retried haha)
$ tailhex /dev/mem
...
0x00000400 | f803 0000 0000 0000 7803 0000 0000 c09f |
...
0x3F8 and 0x378... we know those ones :)
BTW: What the BIOS does not seem to recognize is that PCI card that provides
more LPT ports (LPT2 and LPT3) (I literally fried the LPT1)
So, /dev/mem points to "physical" mem in a sense like DOS has. (Where, the
BIOS, is blend into, as you can see)

Yes, (parallel / serial, I don't care, it's just something to show), or
in DOS-style:
	*(unsigned short far *)0x400
