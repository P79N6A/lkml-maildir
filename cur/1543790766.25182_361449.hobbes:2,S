OK, I haven't looked at those patches really. I think some of that
stuff should go into page_alloc.c and I'd prefer to keep
buffered_rmqueue static.
But no matter for the cleanup patch at hand: let's leave the inline
off, and the compiler will do the right thing if it is static and
there is just a single call site (and I think newer gccs will do
function versioning if there are constant arguments).
