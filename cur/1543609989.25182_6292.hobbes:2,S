That may have been my post you refer to. With 2x5 disks, each capable of
50 MB/s by itself, we can stream 255 MB/s very smoothly in either direction 
with W2K --- as long as FILE_FLAG_NOBUFFER is used. With standard
reads the number is more like 100 MB/s if I recall correctly, so the buffer
cache can definitely get in the way.
With Linux + XFS I was getting 250 MB/s read and 220 MB/s write (with a
bit less smoothness than W2K) using O_DIRECT and no high mem to avoid
bounce buffer copies. Using standard reads the numbers drop to around 
120 MB/s. That was a couple of weeks ago and I want to try tweaking some
more but a co-worker has "borrowed" pieces of the hardware for the moment.
