Well, I did not consider that "space" to be indent, as in:
if($previous_line_was_an_if)
	($indent, $padding) = (/^(\t+)(\x20{2,})/);
I do not want to argue about that now, though.

If the condition becomes so complex that it's "too complex", it should
be split up into multiple ifs, or even functions,

You disagree. "We", as in, the kernel coders, though I do not speak for
them, seem to do it much the way I described, judging from the code they
wrote/write.
Please see the referenced perl script [1] that heuristically tries to figure
out the number of space-continued (SC) vs. tab-continued (TC) lines (L)
following an if (IF) statement.
	linux-2.6.21-rc6$ find . -type f -iname '*.[ch]' -print0 | \
		xargs -0 cat | ./findcont 
	L:7227630 IF:352877 NOCONT:309465 SC:30395 TC:8689 ##
	NOCONT: 87.7% SC:8.6% TC:2.5%
	(Does not quite add up to 100%, but I'll let someone
	else figure that out.)
