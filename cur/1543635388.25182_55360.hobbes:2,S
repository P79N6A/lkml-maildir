I had a similar experience when trying my CD writer on pdc20265 and a
cmd649 based board. Sometimes a write goes fine, sometimes that error
comes up and you get a coaster. Writer is an LG GCE-8160B.  It works
fine on the VIA 686b however, except for certain speed related issues
(audio writes at > 8x make system unresponsive, data writes ok, more
