All the contributors to 2.6.27.8 are known by name & address, and they
hopefully remember what they put into .8 and can quickly tell whether
there is a chance that it could have something to do with Samba going
into an unkillable busy loop.
So, in case of a bug report which even includes a potential way to
reproduce the issue on generic hardware with common tools, "Could you
bisect?  Meanwhile, let's Cc netdev." sounds better to me than "Please
bisect."
