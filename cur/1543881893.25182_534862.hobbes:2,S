So a IA64 platform with i386 sicknesses? And pretty bad case of it since I 
assume that the memory sizes per node are equal. Your solution of taking 
4G off node 0 and then going to node 1 first must hurt some 
processes running on node 0. But there is no easy solution since 
the hardware is badly screwed up with 32 bit I/O. Whatever you do the 
memory balance between the two nodes is making the system behave in
an unsymmetric way.

Could we add a boot time option instead that changes the zonelist build 
behavior? Maybe an arch hook that can deal with it?
