IMO we can still get these bits of information using nsproxy itself (I
admit I haven't looked at the callback requirement yet).
But IMO a bigger use of 'struct container' object in your patches is to
store hierarchical information and avoid /repeating/ that information in
each resource object (struct cpuset, struct cpu_limit, struct rss_limit
etc) a 'struct container' is attached to (as pointed out here : 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/7/356
). However I don't know how many
controllers will ever support such hierarchical res mgmt and thats why I
said option 3 [above URL] may not be a bad compromise. 
Also if you find a good answer for my earlier question "what more
task-grouping behavior do you want to implement using an additional pointer 
that you can't reusing ->task_proxy", it would drive home the need for
additional pointers/structures.

X shouldn't be needed in rcfs patches, because "->ctlr_data" in nsproxy
can directly point to the larger structure (there is no 'struct
container_subsys_state' equivalent in rcfs patches).
Container patches:
	(tsk->containers->container[cpu_ctlr.subsys_id] - X)->cpu_limit
rcfs:
	tsk->nsproxy->ctlr_data[cpu_ctlr.subsys_id]->cpu_limit

yes :)
Eric, did you have any opinion on this thread?
