That sounds pretty much like high application stuff. If I had that in my mind, 
I would not have had asked in linux-KERNEL. For an application it's easy to 
have some directory.
The solution you're proposing is good and elegant --- in it's domain. It 
solves one narrow problem. I need a solution that is broader. Your solution 
wouldn't work with Qt/Embedded apps AND X11 apps AND ncurses apps. Maybe 
because your hardware is only used for playing mpegs. But what if the 
computer is used for tn-5250 (ncurses), Konq/Embedded (Qt/Embedded) and Java 
(X11), just as the user pleases?  In this case you need something general, 
and that usually means a kernel driver (because, in our case, there is no 
kernel interface for a user-space program that can inject key codes back into 
the kernel so that the keycodes would be subject of normal 
controlling-tty-handling).
