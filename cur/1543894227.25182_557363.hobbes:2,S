No, that will delete written data also.  What I'm thinking is in cases
where an application does fallocate() to reserve a lot of space, and
when the application is finished it wants to unreserve any unused space.

If "punch" does not change the file size, how is it possible to determine
the end of the actual written data?  Say you have a file with records
in it, and these records are cancelled as they are processed (e.g. a
journal of sorts).  One usage model for punch() that we had in the past
is to punch out each record after it finishes processing, so that it will
not be re-processed after a crash.  If the file size doesn't change with
punch then there is no way to know when the last record is hit and the
rest of the file needs to be scanned.

But why force the application to do this instead of making the
fallocate API sensible and allowing it to be done directly?

I'd think this makes sense, being natural opposites of each other.
FA_ALLOCATE doesn't overwrite existing data with zeros, so FA_DEALLOCATE
shouldn't erase existing data.  If FA_ALLOCATE extends the file size,
then FA_DEALLOCATE should shrink it if there is no data at the end.

OK, this makes the semantics of XFS_IOC_RESVSP64 and XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP64
clear at least.  The benefit is that it would also be possible (I'm
not necessarily advocating this as a flag, just an example) to have
semantics that are like XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64 (zeroing written data while
preallocating) with:
#define FA_ZERO_SPACE    FA_DEL_DATA
or whatever semantics the caller actually wants, instead of restricting
them to the subset of combinations given by FA_ALLOCATE and FA_DEALLOCATE
(whatever it is we decide on in the end).

Hmm, another flag?  FA_FL_FREE_ENOSPC?  I can imagine applications like
PVRs to want to preallocate, say, an estimated 30 min of space for a show
but if they only get 25 min of space returned they know some cleanup is
in order (which can be done asynchronously while the show is filling the
first 25 min of preallocated space).  Otherwise, they have to loop in
userspace trying decreasing preallocations until they fit, or starting
small and incrementally preallocating space until they get an error.
