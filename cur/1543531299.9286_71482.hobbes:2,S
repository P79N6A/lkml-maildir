Agreed. They want a cheap solution and kernel developers should fill
the source with conditional code to allow them *disable* most of the
useful features of Linux, because they don't suit well their very 
particular need?
They need a specialized OS and probably a specialized web server.
They're free to steel as much code as they like from the linux source tree,
and adapt it. But they should not say "Linux is no good because it
overcommits memory, and it kills our buggy applications".
