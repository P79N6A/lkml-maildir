This looks like it's a generic property of syncing an ext3 file system.
Try turning off laptop_mode and then running "sync". You will probably
see the same behaviour.

For your SSD I guess you need to get rid of the
sync-after-disk-activity, but keep the other VM behaviours of
laptop_mode (such as avoiding swapping out pages / writing back dirty
pages in order to free memory as long as it is also possible to just
drop pages that are not dirty).
You can probably achieve this by:
- having a large commit interval etc., like you have now
- setting laptop_mode to a very large value, e.g. a couple of hours.
That will trigger a sync if and only if there has been *no* disk
activity at all for hours on end -- i.e., pretty much never. And the
other write-reducing VM features of laptop_mode will still be enabled.
It would perhaps be a good thing to split these mechanisms into separate
knobs. Write batching (the sync-after-disk-activity stuff and also the
dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio changes) are a completely separate
mechanism from write avoidance (the other mechanism I mentioned).
Cheers,
Bart
