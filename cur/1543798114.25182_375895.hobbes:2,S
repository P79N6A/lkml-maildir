Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Export cpu info by sysfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The second patch is to export cache info which is similar to
/proc/pal/cpuX/cache_info. One important new item is shared_cpu_map.
shared_cpu_map showes the cpu map sharing the cache.
The items (attributes) are:
	level
	type
	coherency_line_size
	stride
	ways_of_associativity
	store_latency
	load_latency
	store_hints
	load_hints
	alias_boundary
	tag_lsb
	tag_msb
	size
	shared_cpu_map
	attributes
This patch depends on the first patch because they change the same
source file.
