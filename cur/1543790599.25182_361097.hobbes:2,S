I don't think lxr is a suitable tool for code study, but if it works for you
that's ok with me.

I'm defining coherency in the sense that the database is derived from a
particular kernel configuration; that is, I'm only considering files compiled or
included for a particular kernel compilation. That's a good thing or a bad thing
depending on what you're trying to accomplish. If, for example, you're only
interested in an i386 kernel configuration, then you're probably not interested
in files and includes for ppc, s390, etc.
