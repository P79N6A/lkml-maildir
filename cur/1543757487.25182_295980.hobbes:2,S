Not destroying its workqueue is a bug in the module just like any
other resource leak.  It's analogous to a module allocating some
memory with kmalloc() and not calling kfree() when it's unloaded.  If
a module creates a workqueue, then it should call destroy_workqueue()
when it's unloaded.
By the way, the module (or any code calling destroy_workqueue()) must
make sure that it has race conditions that might result in work being
submitted to the queue while it is being destroyed.
