Surely it shouldn't... ioremap() is for mapping "memory-mapped I/O" resources
into the kernel's virtual memory scheme (at least on the i386 arch). There's
no way to tell the CPU/MMU that a particular pages should assert the IO access
pin rather than memory access pin (or however it is done externally).
