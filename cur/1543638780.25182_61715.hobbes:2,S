This seems to be a popular misconception.  Yes, page-coloring
obviously plays no role as long as your cache no bigger than
PAGE_SIZE*ASSOCIATIVITY.  IIRC, Xeon can have up to 1MB of cache and I
bet that it doesn't have a 1MB/4KB=256-way associative cache.  Thus,
I'm quite confident that it's possible to observe significant
page-coloring effects even on a Xeon.
