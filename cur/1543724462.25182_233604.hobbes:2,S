Sparse bug. Hey, it's not perfect, and this case is actually very easy to 
just parse, but harder to build a nice internal representation of it.
In particular, sparse internally really _should_ re-write the above as
	fnret = get_fs();
	p->thread.fs = fnret.seg;
since that is what would happen in real life, but since it never came up
in early testing, I didn't ever really get around to doing it that way.  
Oh, well.
So please don't take _all_ sparse warnings too seriously. Some of them 
literally are still due to sparse limitations. I'm happy to say that they 
are fairly few these days.
