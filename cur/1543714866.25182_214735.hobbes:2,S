Client is a 200MHz ARM; server is a Linux host running 2.6.3 with the
kernel nfs daemon; network is 100Mib.  There is nothing else on the
network except intermittent broadband traffic.  Async is set on the
server side.
While I have seen much worse performance in the last couple of weeks,
I cannot blame NFS when I look at the numbers.
