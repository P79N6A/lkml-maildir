  Definitely not. I want to reduce the number of requests that reach the
bloated thing in userspace by using small in-kernel cache server.

  This can improve performance at the price of making
non-file-sending modules more complicated (the whole different can of
worms here for Apache and others). Still the performance won't be
as high as with cache, and kernel change doesn't prevent servers to do
their own improvements, things seem to be pretty ortogonal here.
