Both are "hardware -> required kernel support" mappings.
I know that people don't like this idea since the CML2 discussions, but 
there even don't seem to be any big problems if anyone wants to put all 
the pieces together and assemble a suitable .config only based on the 
autodetection tools of some distribution and without asking the user 
any questions.

You miss the fundamental point:
The vast majority of kconfig users are _not_ kernel hackers, and they 
neither know nor want to know anything about kernel internals - they 
just want to build a kernel suitable for their system.
You want to make an UI easier to use for the developers but harder to 
use for the users, and that's a bad deal.
