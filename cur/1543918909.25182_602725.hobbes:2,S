Elements I keep in RCU list are policy table for access control
that are referred throughout the lifetime of the kernel.
So, there is hardly any needs to delete these elements.
Honestly speaking, I don't need to use RCU list at all.
Just using a singly linked list that doesn't support deletion is enough.
But James Morris advises me to use the existing API

Thank you.
