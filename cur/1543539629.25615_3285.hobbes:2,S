Your OS is here to let you interface with any kind of network
card it support...
Talking directly with the network seem to me the wrong thing
to do... And even if it is not, you'll duplicate kernel work
doing this that way, thus, lost of CPU time.

You have no choise but looking at the packet.

You can not discard any traffic.
A general purpose network IDS must look at all kind of packet,
searching, for exemple, suspect string...
You can't even say that your IDS must not analyze your internal
network, because internal security is an issue.

That is network IDS job.

The system administrator must do the correlation, that's not up to
the IDS.

You misunderstood me :
I'm not talking about using a kernel based IDS ( userspace is the place
for IDS ), i'm talking about using netfilter (which is kernel) to get 
packet in order to avoid duplicating kernel work ( avoiding having the 
IDS defragmenting IP fragmented packet, which the kernel already does ).
As i've already said, Netfilter allow you to plug to hook in the tcp/ip
stack, so for exemple, your IDS could plug before & after the 
ip defragmentation part.
Unfortunnelly, what is currently lacking to Netfilter in order for IDS
to do that is the ability to caught promiscuous received packet.

For many kind of attack detection, there is always a small amount
of speculations.

 It is well known that M$ product don't make a free() after a malloc(),
the unix community wish them good luck for their future development.
