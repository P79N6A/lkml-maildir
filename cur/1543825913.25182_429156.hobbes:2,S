It seems many HP and Compaq notebooks that this problem; I've got the same 
thing on my NC6000 and it works fine too. BIOS problem?
Andrew, I think this message should be silenced (or at least the note about 
LKML) if there's no evidence of breakage. For the last LKML 4-5 reporters, 
they reported no side-affects. At the very least, the message could be toned 
down somewhat.
