The simplest test case I've found is at
	
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57760
I did/do not have time to check it closely now but at first sight it's
the same I've found.

If we know the impact [how wildly broken compilers are used] we could
decide about the approach, IMHO.
Please note, this is not only about how to make build fail but how not
to waste potentially significant users and developers time if one
circumvent the blocking phase and starts distributing [intentional or
not] the broken binaries. Bigger the impact the bigger the chance it
happens.

Could be also the classical "copy-paste [slightly change one occasion]
then fix one occasion" type of bug? I've never looked the quality of
the gcc source. I really don't know.
