FYI:  The following has been rock solid for the past two days, using the
machine mainly for emacs/LaTeX/konqueror/...   There's fairly heavy swap
traffic, often  25-40 MB swap is used.

I'm swapping over a 3Com 374TX pcmcia card in a 100Mbit hub (hooked up to a
switch, connected to the nbd-server machine)
No problems so far - but then again, this is not an NFS-booting BGP4 router  ;)
