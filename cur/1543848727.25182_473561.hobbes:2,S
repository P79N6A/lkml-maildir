No, the patch submitted by Andrey and Vasily should fix the issue.
Without this, driver still claims 64-bit DMA capability for those MegaRAID SATA controllers.

Example)
For SATA 150-6 with OLD filter,
	if (((1) && ((0) || (1))) || (0) || (0) || (0) || (0) || (0) {
		...;
	}
driver gets into inside of if clause and set DMA mask with 64-bit which is NOT correct.
However, with the patch,
	if (((1) && ((0) && (1))) || (0) || (0) || (0) || (0) || (0) {
		...;
	}
driver bypasses this filter and stay with 32-bit DMA mask.
