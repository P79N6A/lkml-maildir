Cache aliases.  When the same page of physical memory is mapped twice to
user space, let's say at address addr and addr + PAGE_SIZE this is normally
harmless although wasteful on processors with virtually indexed caches as
long as the page is mapped read-only such as in case of ZERO_PAGE.
If the same thing happens with a writable page there is the chance of
severe data corruption.  Some members of the R4000 family are now trying
to be helpful by throwing the kernel a "virtual coherency" exception.  The
bad news about this exception is there might be thousands (the theoretical
worst case would be millions) of it in a single second, so servicing can be
very expensive.  For the ZERO page this can be avoided by using several
pages mapped in a way such that their addresses don't conflict.
