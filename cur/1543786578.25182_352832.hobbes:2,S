More datapoints:
2.6.13.2 is OK.
Latest 2.6.14 from the mercurial repository as of this afternoon is
still affected.  I'll try to narrow it down some more with a binary
search.
It seems that not just any rm will cause the stuck process.  The
following procedure seems to get it every time though (I encountered
this bug first whilst running update-grub):
  # cd /sync_ext2
  # cp /boot/grub/menu.lst ./menu.lst.new
  # cat menu.lst.new > menu.lst
  # rm menu.lst
