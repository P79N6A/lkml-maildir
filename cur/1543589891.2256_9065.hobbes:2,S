This is particularly pretty, but something that might work:
1. a "deceiver" process creates a shared memory page, populates shared
   page with appropriate magic (perhaps copying from its own magic page?)
2. have subterfuge unmap the magic page for the fooled process, and map in
   the shared page in its place (assumes subterfuge can insert system
   calls, instead of just modifying them)
3. deceiver periodically updates magic page
