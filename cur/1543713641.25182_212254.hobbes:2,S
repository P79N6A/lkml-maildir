Hmm.. I wonder if we could get away with not having a new readX interface by 
registering each PCI resource either at driver init time or in arch code with 
the MCA hander.  Then we could just make the read routines use the variable 
that was just read to try to flush out the MCA (there may be better ways to 
do this).  E.g.
arch_pci_scan()
{
	...
	for_each_pci_resource(dev, res) {
		check_region(res);
	}
	...
}
...
unsigned char readb(unsigned long addr)
{
	unsigned char val = *(volatile unsigned char *)addr;
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_CHECK
	/* try to flush out the MCA by doing something with val */
#endif
	return val;
}
...
Then presumably the MCA error handler would see that an MCA occurred in a 
region registered during PCI initialization and return an error for 
pci_read_errors(dev);
