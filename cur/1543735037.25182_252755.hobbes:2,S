"Can of worms" is a tough description for something that there is no
practical security issue for, just a lot of hand waving.  No one even
uses name spaces.
Anyhow, I already said that we could send out a generic kobject instead
of the one tied to the specific device.

In practice stuff like that never works.  Besides, it is not mount(1)
that we want to wrap but the mount(2) system call.  And, uh, I'd rather
stab myself than try to get that patch by Uli.
