And I'm guessing that you can't call usb_create_sysfs_intf_files() until
registration is performed, right?

Right, altsettings.  I forgot about those.  I only ever think in terms of
multiple configurations.
*grumble*
If usb_set_interface() has to be smart enough to remove existing files
first already, then I guess it's reasonably symmetric to have
usb_set_configuration() have the same smarts.  Maybe they can share some
common code, even.
