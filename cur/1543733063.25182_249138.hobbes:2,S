How do multiple PCI domains appear in sysfs? I don't own a machine
with these so I can't just look.
Do they appear like:
/sys/devices/pci0000:00
/sys/devices/pci0001:00
/sys/devices/pci0002:00
I'm trying to figure out where to attach a sysfs attribute for turning
vga off in a domain. I'd like to do something like:
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/vga
/sys/devices/pci0001:00/vga
/sys/devices/pci0002:00/vga
I need to know what the domains look like in sysfs in order to pick
the right place for the attribute.
