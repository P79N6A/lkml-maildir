   Yes, but are the cases where you need your own order common enough
to justify complicating the helper functions?

   Both work. The resource->flags field contains both generic resource flags
(as IORESOURCE_IO) and PCI region flags (lower 4 bits where PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_SPACE_IO
sits).
				Have a nice fortnight
