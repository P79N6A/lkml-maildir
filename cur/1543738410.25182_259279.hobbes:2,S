True, there are probably too many "ifs" in my above statement for a saw
or an airplane or a power plant.  There does seem to be a gray area
between soft and hard realtime, where either approach could be
reasonable.  For example the Mt. St. Helens example, where you could
miss a sample and it would be really bad, but not kill anyone.
