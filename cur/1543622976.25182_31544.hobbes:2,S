Subject: [PATCH] OXCB950 support (was RE: Oxford Semiconductor's OXCB950 UART not recognized by serial.	c)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch (tested on 2.4.17) includes OXCB950 in serial_pci_tbl[]. 
pbn_b0_bt_1_115200 is used instead of pbn_b0_1_115200: the effect is the 
same since the OXCB950 is single-port, but pbn_b0_bt_1_115200 is different 
from pbn_default.

The "Redundant entry" message comes out of serial.c when a card is found 
in
the PCI ID board list, but which function serial_pci_guess_board() also
detects as a generic single UART card (and overwrites the card's
board->flags field in the pci_boards[] array). 
Does anybody think this is a feature? Did I misunderstand?
I suspect that the thought was to detect and eventually remove 
pci_boards[]
entries for generic single-port cards that could also be detected by the
serial_pci_guess_board() function. Can anybody confirm or deny? 
Shouldn't the detection process be considered done when the PCI IDs match?
Why should the "guess" function even be called when the card has already
been found in the PCI board table?
