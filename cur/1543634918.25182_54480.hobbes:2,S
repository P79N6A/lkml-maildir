It has already proven to be stable and robust in the sense that it isn't
worse than the stock scheduler on typical loads and is vastly better on
some.

Here I disagree. Sure behaves like a stability fix to me. On a system with
a mix of interractive and cpu-bound processes, including processes with
hundreds of threads, you just can't get reasonable performance balancing
with nice() because it is totally impractical to keep tuning a thread
which changes from hog to disk io to socket waits with a human in the
loop. The new scheduler notices this stuff and makes it work, I don't even
know for sure (as in tried it) if you can have different nice on threads
of the same process. 
This is not some neat feature to buy a few percent better this or that,
this is roughly 50% more users on the server before it falls over, and no
total bogs when many threads change to hog mode at once.
You will not hear me saying this about preempt, or low-latency, and I bet
that after I try lock-break this weekend I won't fell that I have to have
that either. The O(1) scheduler is self defense against badly behaved
processes, and the reason it should go in mainline is so it won't depend
on someone finding the time to backport the fun stuff from 2.5 as a patch
every time.
