Hello everyone,
I recently upgraded kernel to 2.4.2 on 3 machines.
These machines use DHCP.
2 machines have 3c905B(cyclone) and
1 machine has 3c905c(Tornado).
At boot time, there are over 1 minute delay
to bring up network interface eth0 at 3c905B machines.
There is no problems when booting with kernel 2.2.x
or booting with kernel 2.4.2 on 3c905C machine.
