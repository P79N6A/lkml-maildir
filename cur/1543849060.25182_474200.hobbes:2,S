Lets leave bugs aside thats a different problem. The goal isn't to be
bug proof

X scans all the devices when it sets up so only a video device one would
hang mid mode set.

But I've no idea who, what or why and that makes it hard to handle. If
the thing refcounts then if there are two reasons to be blocked we are
fine and the last reason goes away we resume - it does make it more easy
to make mistakes. If it isnt ref counting I'd prefer block repeated is a
BUG() not a "driver figure this out"

That would have been my choice but the blocking approach seems to be
getting somewhere so it seems worth thrashing out in full.
