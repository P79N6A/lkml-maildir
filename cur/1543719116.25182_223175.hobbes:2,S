I think we only need a single entry point.  Make it a new "drain_percpu_pages()"
or such to break unconverted callers, switch callers of drain_local_pages()
over to the new function.   It needs no SMP ifdefs in it - on_each_cpu() will
do the right thing on UP.
But until something which needs this change is merged into the tree I'd say
that this patch should live with the patch which requires it.
