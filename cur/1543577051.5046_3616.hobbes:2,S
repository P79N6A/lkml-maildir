Note in the failed case you have no line that says "ne.c: ISAPnP reports..."
which is the clue here.  If you supply an i/o address, such as....

then no PnP is involved in the probing at all.  If you are relying on the
PnP part of the probe to activate your card, but it isn't being used....
OTOH, if you *don't* supply an I/O address, then the PnP part of the probe
will be used; you will see the "ne.c: ISAPnP reports..." message, and all
should be well.  So try deleting your options line (for 2.4.x kernels).
There is also a possibility of an i/o conflict - as the other person
had at 0x360 now that check_region is gone - in your case maybe with 
the i/o regions isapnp itself reserves, since your ne2k is way down
low at 0x220. In fact isapnp assumes that NE2000 cards will start
between 0x280 and 0x360 - and avoids this region because of that.
