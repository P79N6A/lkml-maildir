Thanks for this information.
I'll include DMASOUND_PMAC in the list of OSS drivers that might be 
removed in this round (if people report regressions in the ALSA drivers, 
this can still be undone (if someone observes such a regression, he 
should send me the bug number in the ALSA BTS (this is also what 
will be written in the help text of the OSS_OBSOLETE_DRIVER option))).
