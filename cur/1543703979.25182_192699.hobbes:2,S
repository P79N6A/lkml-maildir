These affect ALL hotplug scripts.  If you can't run a hotplug script because
you've exceeded root's ulimit, or the max # of tasks/threads in the system,
you're in trouble - regardless of what the hotplug event was - SOMETHING is
going to go wrong.
If you get ENOMEM you have a bigger problem.
If you get OOM killed, then the OOM killer has gone haywire (not uncommon,
historically).

I'd rather not add anything like that either.  I'm not saying I advocate
fast-and-loose at all.  On the contrary, I think any action taken in
response to a CPU removal needs to be accountable, and wantonly changing
affinity is NOT.
It'll probably not affect me either, nor is it my decision :)
