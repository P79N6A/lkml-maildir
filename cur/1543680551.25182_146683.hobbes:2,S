Subject: [PATCH] Bug in initrd-handling while remounting the root
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

At work we've encountered a problem when trying to netboot 2.4.21.
After /linuxrc has been executed and the kernel tries to remount the
root, it panics with the all too well known message "Unable to mount
root fs on ...".
The kernel bugs out in mount_block_root in the file init/do_mounts.c,
to be more precise in the for-loop. What happens is that it tries to
mount the file system as type ext2 (which happens to be first in the
list in our case), but instead of returning -EINVAL it returns -EBUSY,
the loop exits instead of trying the next (correct) fs-type and the
kernel panics.
Here's a patch:
