Other than modutils(*) there are no issues with RH9 and 2.5.  I am
running RH9 with 2.5 on my daily workstation.
Even NPTL, sysenter, and all the other goodies work flawlessly.  It is
quite nice.
(*) modutils may even work if RH ships the compatibility layer and the
new module tools.  I have no idea, I do not use modules.
