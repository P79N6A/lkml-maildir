   I dunno.  When I wrote the CREDITS page for McAfee's _WebShield_
   product, it ended up being about 400 lines long.  A lot of that is
   the copyright text for the various packages (I included every
   copyright I could find except the *GPL, which I put links to); none
   of these credits ended up in the (pitiful) advertising for the
   products.
   And since WebShield includes a complete Slackware system (it would
   have become Mastodon, except the product was just cancelled last
   month.  Sigh) it includes LOTS of Berkeley-style license code.  And
   there's nothing in that code requiring McAfee to give a credits list
   in the advertisements (because Webshield is Linux, it doesn't have
   the McKusick daemon and the attribution requirement; none of the
   other Berkeley stuff requires that I credit it in advertisements,
   and in fact it requires that I get permission before I do.)

   david parsons \bi/     The horrible thing about it all is that if I'd used
                  \/  a BSD kernel, the only person I would have dropped from
		              the credits list would have been Linus Torvalds.
