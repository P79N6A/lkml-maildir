Is there going to be a fix of some kind for the TCP_CLOSING state? For some
reason my fetchmail gets a lot of sockets stuck in there, and it takes 90
minutes (TCP_RETR2) for them to timeout.
There is a mention that perhaps the FIN should be retransmitted. If this were
done, at least a RST would be received and the socket be destroyed.

P.S. Please respond directly, I am not on the list.
