Its actually kind of the other way around. A modern IDE drive is a cut down
SCSI drive and firmware with some legacy mode glue added. ATAPI is most of
SCSI with some of the sillier stuff removed. The latest generation of the
spec adds the important scsi stuff like tagged queues.

SCSI as a networking protocol is possible but needs a carrier layer. Thats
basically how SCSI over FC/AL works. And people are doing SCSI over IP already
