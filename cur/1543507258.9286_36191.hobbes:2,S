Alexey -- I also see this, but only on my work machine. It first
appeared with 2.3.15-pre3, pre2 and before were (I beleive)
unaffected.
I'm using the same compiler (gcc-2.95) and work and home, but
different NICs although I don't think that's the problem.

I can't seem to replicated it here (at home); it may have something
to do with the network load. At home, the load is fairly light,
whereas at work, the load is much greater. When I first boot at work,
everything looks normal (lo is up, it's not that) but after a short
period of time, usually associated with about 100MB of network
transfers, networking croaks... I can't even ping localhost.
I'll try to reproduce this here and see happens...
