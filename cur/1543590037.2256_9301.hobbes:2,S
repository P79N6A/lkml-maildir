Ah, you learn from the master.

Handling of mapped device memory should not change. For example
there is the X server with mapped video memory. There is another
RSS value provided elsewhere in case one does not want to include
mapped device memory.
Currently top uses the statm file in the following manner:
  case P_SIZE:
    sprintf(tmp, "%5.5s ", scale_k((task->size << CL_pg_shift), 5, 1));
    break;
  case P_TRS:
    sprintf(tmp, "%4.4s ", scale_k((task->trs << CL_pg_shift), 4, 1));
    break;
  case P_SWAP:
    sprintf(tmp, "%4.4s ",
	scale_k(((task->size - task->resident) << CL_pg_shift), 4, 1));
    break;
  case P_SHARE:
    sprintf(tmp, "%5.5s ", scale_k((task->share << CL_pg_shift), 5, 1));	    break;
  case P_DT:
    sprintf(tmp, "%3.3s ", scale_k(task->dt, 3, 0));
    break;
  case P_RSS:	/* rss, not resident (which includes IO memory) */
    sprintf(tmp, "%4.4s ",
	scale_k((task->rss << CL_pg_shift), 4, 1));

One could count pages that are mapped executable and do not come
from the main executable... but this is pretty worthless and does
not consider non-executable library sections.
The latest "top" does not bother to display this value.

On my system, "statm" takes 50% longer than "stat" or "status".
Maybe there is a significant difference with Oracle on a 32 GB box?
I'd rather top didn't have to read the file at all.
