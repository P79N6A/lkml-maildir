This is /proc/bus/input/devices from  2.6.12-rc1-mm3. I changed the protocol
to auto-dev and commented out # Option "Device" "/dev/input/event1" and now
it works. What apparently happened is that from 2.6.11 to .12-rc1 the event
device changed from event1 to event2. 
Thanks and sorry for the post. Compiling in serial console now, to try to
see what happens with swsusp... 
Thanks again and have a nice day,
