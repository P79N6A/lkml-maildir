Oops, sorry, I didn't read your bar/baz correctly.  Yes, it's two directory 
objects, but it's only one file object, and the history (not including the 
name changes) is attached to the file object, not the directory object.  This 
is implemented via an object id for each file object, something like an inode 
number.

Ah, but it does.  Sorry for not explaining the object id thing earlier.
