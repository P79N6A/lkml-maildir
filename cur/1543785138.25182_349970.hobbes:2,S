It's not small, but definitely not dead.  SGI ia64 boxes already
do this, and I'm got similar kernel support for HP ia64 boxes almost
ready to go.  But I don't work much on X.org, so I don't know how
long it will take to push the changes there.
And the kernel VGA arbiter is still missing, so I currently have
to turn off VGA console support in the kernel.
And of course, things would be much more interesting if the x86
support were in place.
