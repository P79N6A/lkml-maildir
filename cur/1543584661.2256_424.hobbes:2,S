It's not too hard to patch that up, eg quickersort. N^2 isn't too bad for
short queues anyway especially considering the complexity of the
alternatives.

Assume you mean sorting into hash buckets as opposed to "count the number
of occurrences of each type of element in a narrow range, discarding the
actual element". Most hashes are subvertible too and probably don't fair
any better than N^2.
