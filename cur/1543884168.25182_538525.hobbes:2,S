I use framebuffer console pretty much for one purpose -- it sucks less
memory bandwidth when you're stuck with a UMA configuration.  Text modes
require random access to the font buffer, which means it hogs the DRAM
pretty badly, unless the chipset designer decided to burn an 8K SRAM,
which is still a pretty pricey hunk of chip real estate.
