Well, there isn't really a steady state as such. On a loaded system
there are periods during compile benchmarks where the system spends
half the time and more in I/O wait, so some processes do get to run
and do some minimal amount of work.

I instrumented the kernel a while ago to log page fault handling
(address, backing file if available) when the system became idle with
all processes blocked. I can resurrect that code which would allow for
larger samples. I'll post results if/when I get around to do it.
