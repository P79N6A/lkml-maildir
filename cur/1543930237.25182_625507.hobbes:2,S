Today I noticed pgrep doesn't work.  It seems the reason is a missing
Name: tag in the status file for a process in /proc.
# cat /proc/1/status
init
State:  S (sleeping)
Tgid:   1
Pid:    1
PPid:   0
TracerPid:      0
...etc, etc...
This is supposed to look like:
# cat /proc/1/status
Name:	init
State:	S (sleeping)
Tgid:	1
Pid:	1
PPid:	0
TracerPid:	0
...
