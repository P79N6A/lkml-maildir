Incorrect - because this all happened far too quickly.  This is one of
the reasons that I ended up having to redo various parts of the ARM tree
because stuff broke - set_kset_name() completely vanished introducing
compile errors, and iirc some merge issues as well.
I had patches introducing new system objects which use that, and
modifications extremely close to other uses in the PXA code.
The end result (through rebuilding the affected parts of my git tree, and
asking people for replacement patches) was something that is bisectable -
but had I tried to merge stuff as is, it would've been an utter mess, and
_was_ unbuildable.
