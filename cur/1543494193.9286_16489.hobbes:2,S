The fundamental problem between using the IDE/EIDE device and a SCSI
device is that many IDE device/controller combinations corrupt the
bus. This is particularly evident when using motherboards that have
both built-in SCSI (aic7xxx), and IDE such as this "Thunder board".
Attempts to copy from an IDE to/from the SCSI may (read will) result
in extreme data corruption. In other words, so evident that there will
be no possibility of thinking that it's just casual.
We attempted to find out why and determined that the IDE interface
just qualifies an address and R/W and slams its data on the bus
ignoring any timing specifications whatsoever. Of course the last
device to write data wins, but the currents that flow when two
devices are writing opposite-polarity bits causes ringing when
the deselected device stops writing. These ring-down glitches _are_
data. Notgood(tm).
