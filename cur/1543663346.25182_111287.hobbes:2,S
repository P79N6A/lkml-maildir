but what about masking the process.  An example is... I want to use the
mmap syscall. the kernel implementation uses current->mm, but what i want
to do is, the current macro or the get_current() function should give me
the task_struct of a process so that the effect of the syscall is seen on 
that process and not on the current kernel thread.
