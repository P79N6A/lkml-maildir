Just FYI... For the m68k port, I have ca. 150 KiB of patches in Linus' INBOX
(if they're still there, mainly irqreturn_t stuff), and about 100 KiB of
postponed stuff I'm not gonna send (i.e. things that are not ready for
submission yet, or that are too controversial).
Amiga (non-SCSI) and Q40/Q60 should work fairly well in 2.5.x, except that
early userspace (launching of /sbin/init) got broken in 2.5.67 or 2.5.68.
For comparison, 2.4.x has no stuff in Marcelo's INBOX, and about the same 100
KiB of postponed stuff. Not counting Michael Müller's new TekXpress port, which
is not even in Linux/m68k CVS (
http://linux-m68k-cvs.apia.dhs.org/
) yet.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
