Hi Anton,
[I can't reach you directly, hope you read this on lkml]
Today I sorted out UNICODE -> koi8-r filename translation
and now I'm able to mount NTFS volumes and see Cyrillic filenames.
However, when I enter my MP3 fold^Wdirectory in Midnight Commander
it complains that it cannot stat two files (DDT-Rain.MP3 and 
DDT-Last_autumn.MP3, actual names are in Cyrillic). Other files
(there are lots of them) are visible.
My mount options are:
ro,iocharset=koi8-r,noatime
I can provide any additional info you need, just ask.
