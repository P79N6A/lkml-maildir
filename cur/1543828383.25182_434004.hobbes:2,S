I do appreciate and realize the problem, thats why I asked the question.
There are some ways of solving this problem (that I could think about)
1. Keep a whole number and fraction pair and increment the fraction until
   it reaches a whole number and then schedule the task when the whole
   number value reaches a minimal threshold. Or provide tasks with some
   minimal whole number ticks in advance and then do not schedule them
   again till their fractions add up to the whole number (credit system).
   For example if T1 and T2 have a cap of 0.5%. Then represent the values
   as whole number zero and fraction represented as 1 and divisor as 2.
   Every two ticks their whole number would become 1 and fraction 0, divisor 2.
   Schedule the tasks for a tick whenever its whole number becomes 1
   and reset then its whole number to 0.
2. In a group based cap management system, schedule some tasks (highest priority)
   until their cap run out. In the subsequent rounds pick and choose tasks that
   did not get a chance to run earlier.
Solving this is indeed a interesting problem.
