I have been using two monitors, VGA and MDA, on my machine for over a year
now. Originally I was using 2.0.x with a patch to handle the MDA. I tried
2.2.x but I was not happy with the support for my MDA, there were a number of
bugs. When the MDA was intiallised the cursor would jump to an odd place on
the screen, screen blanking would make the console crash, as would flipping
for X11 to any console on the MDA.
I started running 2.2.x in December, I have been ignoring and working around
the various bugs in the linux kernel since then. I tried fixing it in
December, but my patch was not very clean, so i did not release it. I have
since redone my patch from scratch. It is attached.
I think the problems were caused because mdacon.c was written by somebody
using a Hercules graphics adaptor. I am using an original IBM MDA. I tracked
down the odd cursor movements on boot-up to some detection code. I commented
out the offending code, not sure if this is going to cause anybody problems,
comments?
The screen blanking just crashes my MDA card, so I assume that it is something
you can do on a Hercules, but not on an original MDA. I added a check to see
if the card is an MDA, and if so, then to just erase every character on the
screen. Seems to work.
This patch is against 2.2.14, I do not think there are many changes with
2.3.x, so it should apply okay to that as well.
