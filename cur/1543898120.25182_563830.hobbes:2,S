Subject: [RFC] automatic CC generation for patch submission
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/29/297

Hello,
I'd like to present a suggestion for automatic generation of 
carbon copy fields in the E-Mails of posted patches.
Basically, instead of manually figuring out who to add to CC
when sending a patch to LKML by looking at MAINTAINERS, a 
script can look at '.maintainers' files spread across the
source tree and automatically generate a proper list of CCs
for a patch.
To illustrate: If a patch affects a file under 
drivers/net/e1000, the CC script will look at these files
  drivers/net/e1000/.maintainers
  drivers/net/.maintainers
  drivers/.maintainers
  .maintainers
... to gather up the mailing list addresses or an individual 
maintainer inbox address.
A posssible format for this file could be a newline-separated
list of:
  [filename wildcard]:e-mail
For example, drivers/scsi/.maintainers would contain:
  libiscsi.*:open-iscsi@googlegroups.com
  scsi_*.c:scsi-devel@vger.kernel.org
  etc...
Or, instead (or in addition) of having a '.maintainers' file 
each directory we can modify source files by adding parsable 
'/* MAINTAINER: name@domain */' comments. 
Some extensions to the popular E-Mail clients might be needed 
here. Also, a bot reading LKML would automatically send links 
about posted patches to the other mailing lists whenever 
someone forgets to add a CC.
Any comments?
