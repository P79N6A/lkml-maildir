Actually the addresses you see there are physical bus addresses not neccessarily
and on x86 quite likely not actually mapped.

If you want to mmap the device then you really want to put the device in its
own 4K aligned 4K sized PCI window, otherwise adjacent devices will become
accessible too and that might not be desirable.
Or you could avoid providing mmap.
