I don't much care, but if there is renaming afoot, I'd vote for
->shrink_zones(struct zone **zones, ..)
  ->shrink_zone(struct zone *, ...)
   ->shrink_inactive_list(struct zone *, ...)
    ->shrink_page_list(struct list_head *, ...)
   ->shrink_active_list (alternatively, leave as refill_inactive_list)
shrink_zone and do_shrink_zone don't really say any more to me than
shrink_zone and shrink_cache.
