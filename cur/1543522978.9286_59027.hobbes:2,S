"Trying to restart the transmitter" message is sympthom of a problem.
Transmitter hang may be caused by various reasons starting from temporary
out-of-memory conditions and up to a hardware failure.
You may wish to get a driver from
ftp://ftp.nc.orc.ru/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/
and use it with debug=3 option in /etc/conf.modules.
The driver gives more commets about what's happening.
