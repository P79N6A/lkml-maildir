Let's see.... all the work being done for clustering would definitely
benefit... all the static images on your webserver--and static images
makes up most of the bandwidth from web servers (images, activeX controls,
java apps, sound clips...)... NFS servers, Samba servers (both of which
are used more than you may think)... email servers...
Once Real Networks patches their Realserver to use sendfile (which
shouldn't bee all that hard), then that would help too....
I think that sendfile can be used in a LOT of applications, and the only
ones that wouldn't benefit are mostly low-bandwidth anyway (CGI apps
almost always return either a small html file or a small image file, then
there's telnet and other interactive utilities...).
Most applications that use a lot of bandwidth (and thus a lot of CPU time
sending the packets) are capable of being patched to use sendfile.
