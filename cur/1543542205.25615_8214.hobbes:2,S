Hi,

You have to keep locally all the time, putting it into a structure riscs
that the flags are "saved" for too long, see also the sparc restrictions
on that.

So what? In this case it's absolutely unnecessary to know the type, only
save_flags/restore_flags have any business with it. It could also be
structure to possibly store some more information and the user shouldn't
care at all.
