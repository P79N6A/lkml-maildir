I seem to recall if you say Y to ext2 and Y to ext3 and your root is on ext3
then it's likely to be mounted as ext2 unless you set rootfstype=...
The ext3 help comment also warns you should set it to Y, so people with
root ext3 are likely to get a surprise if they follow both help.  Would it
be better to say something like "if your root partition is extX you almost
certainly want to say Y here"?  Or warn about the rootfstype issue maybe?
