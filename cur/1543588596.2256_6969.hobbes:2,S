Subject: USB fails in 2.4.3-ac6

With 2.4.3-ac6, USB input doesn't work.  It works with -ac4, and I'm
waiting for -ac13 or so before I try something later.
By "doesn't work", I mean that the USB keyboard and mouse are never
detected.  A config snippet:
CONFIG_INPUT=y
CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X=1024
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y=768
CONFIG_INPUT_JOYDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV=y
CONFIG_USB=y
# CONFIG_USB_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y
# CONFIG_USB_BANDWIDTH is not set
CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT=y
CONFIG_USB_HID=y
Has anyone else seen this problem?  I suspect it is the Alt UHCI driver
which I read somewhere was preferred for VIA-based systems.  I don't
really know what the difference is between them - the help in the kernel
doesn't really say much about how they are different other than that they
are.
I must compile the USB stuff into the kernel as I do not have legacy input
devices on this system (and am proud of it!  hehe)
