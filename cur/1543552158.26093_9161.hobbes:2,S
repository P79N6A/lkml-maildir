No.  The AGP bus is never ON a PCI bus.
To quote the AGP 2.0 spec section 1.2:
"A.G.P. neither replaces nor diminishes the necessity of PCI in the system. 
This high speed port (A.G.P.) is physically, logically, and electrically 
independent of the PCI bus."
"The A.G.P. interface specification uses the 66 MHz PCI (PCI Local Bus 
Specification) specification as an operational baseline, and provides four 
significant performance extensions or enhancements to the PCI specification
which are intended to optimize the A.G.P. for high performance 3D graphics 
applications. These A.G.P. extensions are not described in, or required by, 
the PCI Local Bus Specification. These extensions are:
· Deeply pipelined memory read and write operations, fully hiding memory 
  access latency.
· Demultiplexing of address and data on the bus, allowing almost 100% bus 
  efficiency.
· New AC timing in the 3.3 V electrical specification that provides for 
  one or two data transfers per 66-MHz clock cycle, allowing for real data 
  throughput in excess of 500 MB/s.
· A new low voltage electrical specification that allows four data transfers 
  per 66-MHz clock cycle, providing real data throughput of up to 1 GB/s."
So they started with the PCI spec, but they changed the logical meaning
of a lot of the bus signals, they added a lot of bus signals, they run it 
about 8 times faster, they changed the voltage and a bunch of other stuff.  
I say it is a different animal now.

The spec itself is at:

In any case, I do not see how this topic belongs on the l-k list.
Contact me off-list if you need more info.
