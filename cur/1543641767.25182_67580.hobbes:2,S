No, it cannot be referenced by an open struct file because you copy the
structure, not pointers to it.

Yes.
Note however that the structure is like this:
struct vfs_cred
{
	uid_t uid, gid;
	vfs_cred_groups* groups;
}
vfs_cred_copy(struct vfs_cred* dest, struct vfs_cred* src)
{
	dest->uid = src->uid;
	dest->gid = src->gid;
	dest->groups = src->groups;
	atomic_inc(&src->groups->count);
}
Of course if you don't need groups you can avoid copying them.
This is efficient if you usually either check the uid and gid or copy
only them (omitting groups).
If instead copying the whole structure is more frequent than the
operations described above, then use reference counting and
copy-on-write for the whole structure, but I don't think that this is
the case.
