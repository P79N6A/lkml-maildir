Thanks for the hint. I fixed pmap_create() according to your proposal and now 
nfsd works again. 
One more question about something I'd like to understand: 
Petes fix limits the number of anonymous mounts to 1279. There was a shorter 
patch from Andi Kleen which basically just replaced the search for a secure 
port from 800 downwards (in xprt.c, xprt_bindresvport() ) by a bind operation 
to any port (not just a secure one). Raising the count of elements of 
unnamed_dev_in_use in fs/super.c to eg 4096 resulted in the opportunity to 
mount as many NFS directories.  Allthough this patch suffered from two NFS 
problems (the nfsd problem just discussed, as well as a problem when NFS 
mounting from another linux box) it showed a way to use  a very large number 
of NFS mounts.  
Can somebody explain the major difference between both solutions? Why did you 
Pete base your patch on 4 new major device numbers whereas Andis patch did 
not need them? Are there any major drawbacks involved not doing so?
Thanks Rainer
