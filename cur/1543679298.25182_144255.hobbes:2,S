I have :
$ alphaev56-unknown-linux-gnu-size -V
GNU size 2.14 20030612
Copyright 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This program is free software; you may redistribute it under the terms of

Also I tried to compare assembly output of native vs crosscompiler and have found the result to be
different substantionally (unfortunatelly I cannot understand alpha assembly, but I see the
code looks different in the beginning. Also assembly file generated by cross-gcc produces
wrong result after translated/linked using native binutils). I assume that binutils are not involved in
"gcc -S" process.
See attached assembly generated by cross compiler vs native compiler.
