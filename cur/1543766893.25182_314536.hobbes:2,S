To put things in concrete terms, here it is:
int dlm_ls_lock( 
   /*1*/  dlm_lshandle_t lockspace,
   /*2*/  uint32_t mode,
   /*3*/  struct dlm_lksb *lksb,
   /*4*/  uint32_t flags,
   /*5*/  void *name,
   /*6*/  unsigned int namelen,
   /*7*/  uint32_t parent,
   /*8*/  void (*ast) (void *astarg),
   /*9*/  void *astarg,
   /*10*/ void (*bast) (void *astarg),
   /*11*/ struct dlm_range *range);

32 bit integers at the moment.  I hope it stays that way.

CMAN provides a PF_CLUSTER.  This facility seems cool, but I haven't got much 
experience with it, and certainly not enough to know if PF_CLUSTER is really 
necessary, or should be put forth as a required component of the common 
infrastructure.  It is not clear to me that SCTP can't be used directly, 
perhaps with some library support.

This is rather nice: event messages are delivered over a socket.  The specific 
form of the messages sucks somewhat, as do the wrappers provided.  These need 
some public pondering.

Suspend/resume barriers take the form of a simple message protocol, 
administered by CMAN.

Security?  What is that?  (Too late for me to win that dinner now...)
Security is currently provided by restricting socket access to root.

Yes.  For the next month or two it should be ambitious enough just to ensure 
that the interfaces are simple, sane, and known to satisfy the base 
requirements of everybody with existing cluster code to contribute.  And 
automagic aspects are also worth discussing, just to be sure we don't set up 
roadblocks to that kind of improvement in the future.  I don't think we need 
too much automagic just now, though.

I _hope_ that we can arrive at a base membership infrastructure that is 
convenient to use either from kernel or user space.  User space libraries 
already exist, but with warts of various sizes.
