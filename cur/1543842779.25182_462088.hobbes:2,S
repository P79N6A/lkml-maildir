Hmm.  Trying to shoot holes into your approach, I find two potential
problems:
A) With sufficient fragmentation, all inactive pages have one active
neighbour, so shrink_inactive_list() will never find a cluster of the
required order.
B) With some likelihood, shrink_active_list() will pick neighbours
which happen to be rather hot pages.  They get freed, only to get
paged in again within little more than rotational latency.
How about something like:
1. Free 1<<order pages from the inactive list.
2. Pick a page cluster of requested order.
3. Move all pages from the cluster to the just freed pages.
