If we find enough information in the CVS tree which would allow
anybody to trace back each change to what was submitted by the author
of the change (this being a GNU patch and a patch comment), this
would be perfect for me. I can't speak for the 'group of BK 
complainers' but I can't see a *technical* reason why they would
disagree with this.

I'll let them answer themselves.

Informaly, exactly what I said before: Be able to find enough information
in the CVS tree which would allow anybody to trace back each change
to what was submitted by the author of the change (= patch + comment).
How you can make this happen is another problem. The obvious way to
implement this is using CVS branches and merges but this could be
too much work for you.
You said before that:

(and know I agreed at the moment), but thinking again about this I'm not
sure anymore how "sticking the BK changeset key into the delta history"
gives us "BK level granularity". From what I understand (but you are the
SCM expert not me so I may be missing something) there is exactly 
one delta per 'trunk' changeset, so if you have a file being modified
several times on a branch you will end with one single delta which is
the merge of the separate patches. I'm not sure how, by adding several
'BK changeset keys' into the log entry of the merged delta you make
one able to resplit the delta later.
What am I missing here ?
Thanks,
Stelian.
