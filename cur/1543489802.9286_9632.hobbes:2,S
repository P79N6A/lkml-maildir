I think for this patch to be somewhat useful it's best that it's usefulness
is as easily attained as possible. Since the best use I can think for this
is to 'rescue' a lost .config file the easiest way to get this would be to
cp /proc/.config /usr/src/linux
and the type of editing above would just complicate matters at best.
(if there's better uses for this I'd wanna hear them, but that's the main
thing I'd use it for... well... the only thing really :)
