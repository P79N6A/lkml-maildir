Using the above approach, we (the app writers) would never agree on the
syscall lists required for different seccomp modes ;-)
How hard would it be to have a per-task bitmap of syscalls allowed? This
way, a task could restrict to the exact subset of syscalls required for
maximum security.
The bitmap would
- Be allocated on demand (for no overhead in the common case)
- Deny all syscalls not covered by the supplied bitmap, to cater for
syscall table expansion
- Be inherited across fork and (probably) shared across clone
