The original place is in the critical path too.  It's just at the outer 
function which eventually calls ata_qc_issue() (the mapping is almost 
one to one).

Our issue path is somewhat expensive due to SCSI -> ATA translation but 
I don't think it really matters on any modern cpu.  It can definitely 
hurt on embedded tho.  :-(
