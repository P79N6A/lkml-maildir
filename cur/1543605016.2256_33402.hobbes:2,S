Can you elaborate on that? I think in standard Linux a running 
adjtime() continues even after setting the time, and MOD_OFFSET and 
adjtime() both use the same variable, so don't expect the other to 
finish once you have used one of both. Is that the problem?
You could (to send me some flames) try a PPSkit patched kernel instead. 
The latest offer (not officially released is for kernel 2.4.7). Works 
at home for some weeks now...

Odd, very odd! Can you track it down to a system call?

That's how adjtime() works.

I don't believe that, but I believe that adjtime() simply continues 
after a settimeofday(). Of course I've fixed that in my patches a long 
time ago.

Honestly, Dave, your sample kernel code completely leaves out the topic 
of adjtime() vs. settimeofday(). One has to guess with some sound 
reasoning what's probably the best to do.

P.S. BCC'd to linux-kernel, so maybe some new people will respond.
