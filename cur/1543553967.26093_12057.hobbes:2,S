It is the way it is done that is wrong. At present the X server is in
total control of setting the console system back to text mode. This
works under normal conditions but when the system is stressed or X
fails you are stuck. The console system should be setting the video
hardware back to vga text mode instead of the X server. I have been
working on a patch that does that.
