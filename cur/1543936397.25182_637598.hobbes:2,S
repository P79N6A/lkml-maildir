Wanted where? Haven't seen a coment from Bjorn? But -- while removing them 
both looks (as) sensible from a mirror-image viewpoint, this wouldn't fix 
the problem.
As fas as I understand things, "hibernation" is basically "save state, shut 
down machine" where the latter step is going to disable the card inevitably. 
On resume, you're going to need to restore the resources (that were saved in 
pnp_dev->res) that it was using to the card, which is what pnp_start_dev() 
does -- it not being called is the current problem of the card not coming 
back to life.
pnp_stop_dev() could go in this specific situation. Not much point in first 
disabling the thing it seems if a subsequent shutdown is going to take care 
of that anyway. However, suspend/resume isn't just called in the case of 
complete hibernation I guess and I know nothing about it all -- hence my 
request to the hiberhation people for how this is designed to be.
But we certainly need the pnp_start_dev() in the current flow of things. It 
not being called is the problem this fixes...
Rene.
