There's no obvious solution to this problem, so it's going to take some 
design effort to come up with a solution.  We can work on the problem, 
but I don't think we can allow it to get in the way of getting our 
currently proposed SPU profiling functionality into the kernel.

There is no sample buffer for the kernel in SPU profiling.  When 
OProfile gets notified of an SPU task switching out (object_if == 0), we 
stop recording samples for the corresponding SPU.  If SPUFs sends the 
notification after the spu_save operation, we still would be collecting 
samples during that time; however, since the VMAs of these samples would 
not map to any fileoffset in the SPU binary that's executing, our 
current implementation throws them away.  We could change that behavior 
and record them in the samples buffer as "anonymous samples".  Not sure 
it that would help too much, as you wouldn't be able to distinguish 
between spu_save samples and samples from generated stubs that are 
executing from the stack.
