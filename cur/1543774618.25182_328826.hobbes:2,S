Just for completeness, Thomas Winischoffer tracked this down over the
weekend, I had stared at it previously to no great avail,
The issue was with the user space SiS Mesa driver having an
uninitialised structure on the stack for the copy command sent to the
DRM, with the old layout it would end up with zero'ed reserved fields
by luck most of the time, with the new one it went the other way..
the fix is now in Mesa CVS....
Dave.
