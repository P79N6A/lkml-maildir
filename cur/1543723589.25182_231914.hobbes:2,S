Actually, there is still one remaining from looking at the patches I am
afraid.
Admittedly, it is due to the use of a somewhat, unelegant approach,
however it worked quite well (very nice speed bonuses) before the
locking patches.
Specificly, if you have a thread doing bulk reads on a USB device in a
loop, and the device stops talking to you (for instance, waiting for you
to reply), it becomes impossible to take any action on the device,
including aborting the read or issuing a write to the device to tell it
to keep talking until such a time as the read times out, the device
speaks to us, or the device is physically disconnected.
Using timeouts can mediate this, but at the cost of being far less
responsive unless you use a very short timeout.
I am unsure if the kernel provides the locking infrastructure to allow
us to keep us from reading/writing while doing the various events, while
also allowing us to read and write at the same time.

Ah, my mistake.

On a modern X86 machine use the PCI/AGP bus data. On a PS/2 use the MCA bus
data. On nubus use the nubus probe data. On old style ISA bus PCs done a large
pointy hat and spend several years reading arcane and forbidden scrolls
