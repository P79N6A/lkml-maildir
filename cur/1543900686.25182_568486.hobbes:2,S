Ok, this sounds reasonable.

But this does *not*, IMHO. It quite defeats the whole concept of
feature-removal-schedule.txt. I think that file exists precisely
because we cannot gratuitously break userspace interfaces just
like that, but when something gets put up there with a removal date
that is a good one year in the future, and userspace tools _still_
continue to use it ... then, I suspect something's seriously wrong.
Either the feature-removal-schedule.txt file has become something
that users don't even bother checking, or else, they _know_ that
even if they don't bother keeping up with the pace in kernel-land,
that interface still won't go away (because they're still using it!).
In both the above cases, it appears that file itself has become
irrelevant and a "feature" that could be "removed" ... :-)
