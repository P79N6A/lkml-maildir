Please Don't do this:
 #include <linux/ethtool.h>
 #include <linux/device.h>
 #include <linux/eisa.h>
+#include <linux/mca-legacy.h>
 #include <asm/uaccess.h>
If you're getting MCA_NOTFOUND undefined, it's because CONFIG_MCA_LEGACY isn't 
set when mca.h is included (either because it's not in your kernel config, or 
possibly because config.h isn't included into the right place in the 
driver---the latter doesn't look to be the problem for 3c509.c).
