The advantage is that you now have a good place to document all of
these formats - your Kconfig file.
And you select the default target for the user.
How did I know uboot required mkimage before - now it can be documented
in Kconfig.
So the situation above is actually a good example why it is whortwhile
to move the kernel image selection to the config stage.
If they all should be part of the kernel build is another discussion.
