On the other hand, I _guarantee_ you that it helps that we have ext2-3, 
and not just ext2 (nobody even tried to keep ext1 compatible, thank the 
Gods).
If for no other reason, than the fact that the ext3 development could be 
much more aggressive early on. Exactly because it did NOT screw up the old 
filesystem that everybody else depended on.
So we have empirical evidence that splitting filesystem work up does 
actually help.
