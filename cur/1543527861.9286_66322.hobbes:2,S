I understand what you mean by "generally usable".  My instinct is to put
everything that a user might need to get his system running (and a few
things he might just want) in as a config option, and then document it to
death (both in the code & in the documentation).  My (somewhat outdated)
Documentation/Configure.help diff is 10.5k.  Documentation/i386/e820.txt is
another 11k.  arch/i386/defconfig is set to the most likely values.  (Most
of the options are for arch/i386/kernel/setup.c.)  Anyone who disagrees with
your evaluation of "most likely" has to have read the docs in order to do
so.
I'm trying to figure out the parameters of an acceptable config option.
