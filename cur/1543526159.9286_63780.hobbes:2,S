Solaris manages to do this quite well without any weird interactions between 
kernel and userspace:  vold keeps track and notifies a listener which pops 
up the dialog if you're running X.  If you aren't, you get a text message 
instead.
Seriously, find a Solaris box and look at vold and rmmount.  They're not 
perfect, but they don't suck all that badly either.
