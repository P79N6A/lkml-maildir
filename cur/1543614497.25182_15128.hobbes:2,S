I'd start with:
- read the existing smartcard drivers
- check the windows driver - there is software that monitors the serial port and logs all calls.

Try to reverse engineer the protocol between the driver and the smartcard reader.
- open the smartcard reader, and check if you can identify the producer of the ICs that are used. Then try to find the datasheet.
google often helps.
- Ask the company that makes the smartcard reader - perhaps they'll help you?
I'm not sure if the driver should be user space or kernel space, but I'd definitively start in userspace.
Good luck,
