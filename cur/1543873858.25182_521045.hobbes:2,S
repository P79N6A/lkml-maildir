That is not the same patch I tried before.  This one does apply and build
fine (after make defconfig ARCH=um).  
Technically utrace_native_view doesn't belong in the tracehook patch (but
in the regset one to follow it), but it is harmless.
I've merged it into my current tree.  You can get this via GIT if you like
that.  I do regular merges from Linus's GIT tree, so any upstream UML
changes that merge cleanly or have trivial conflict fixes I can do will be
taken care of automatically.  For future updates, please send me
incremental changes based on my current stuff; the GIT branches and the
2.6-current patches on my utrace web page always match up.  My patch set
generation uses just one fixed log message for utrace-tracehook-um.patch,
so tell me if you want to adjust it from log text in today's patch.
Thanks,
Roland
