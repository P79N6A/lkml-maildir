Well thank you very much indeed. I'm pleased that the code I decided to rip 
out of the next update also took whatever bug was there with it. Fortunately 
it also is not dependant on the buggy sched: accurate user accounting patch 
that I gave up on so here is an incremental from the current -mm queue to 
this code without the "accurate user accounting patch" component for anyone 
who's trying to track just what I'm planning on moving forward with.
