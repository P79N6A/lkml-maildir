Which way?  I was running quite fast here, several minutes an
hour, then I discovered the tickadj command, found its default
was 10000, and started reducing it.  At 9926, I'm staying within
a sec an hour now.  I have no idea when this started, I didn't
discover it till I had already been running Ingo's realtime
patches for a while, then checked with a stock 2.6.9 and found it
was doing it then.
