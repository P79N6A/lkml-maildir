It boggles my (perhaps underdeveloped) mind to have things that are files
_and_ directories at the same time. The last time this was discussed was
for handling forks (a la Mac et al) in files, and it was shot down.

It says "foo" and "foo/." are the same _directory_, where "foo" is a
directory as otherwise "foo/<something>" makes no sense, AFAICS. Is there
any mention on a _file_ "bar" and going "bar/" or "bar/<something>"?
