So the kernel with this UPDT() hung at the 2nd sleep:
                    Method (UPDT, 0, NotSerialized)
                    {
                        If (IGNR)
                        {
                            Decrement (IGNR)
                        }
                        Else
                        {
                            If (H8DR)
                            {
                                If (Acquire (I2CM, 0x0064)) {}
                                Else
                                {
                                    Store (I2RB (Zero, 0x01, 0x04), Local7)
                                    If (Local7)
                                    {
                                        Fatal (0x01, 0x80000003, Local7)
                                    }
                                    Release (I2CM)
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
Relative to a working kernel (well, a kernel that I could get to hang
only once, and then all reboots afterwards it never would hang), these
are the extra lines:
                                    Store (I2RB (Zero, 0x01, 0x04), Local7)
                                    If (Local7)
                                    {
                                        Fatal (0x01, 0x80000003, Local7)
                                    }
Since I don't think Fatal() isn't being called, I guess the problem is
in I2RB.  But all those magic numbers in I2RB make me recultant to take
out lines, unless you tell me which changes won't harm the hardware.
