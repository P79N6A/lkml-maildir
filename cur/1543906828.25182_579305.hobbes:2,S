I now have at least three complaints about the patch I just submitted: Your 
complaint is valid, the empty directories all the files were moved out of 
don't seem to be deleted when I use git to apply this patch, and I didn't 
move the blackfin directory into arch because it wasn't there when I 
initially did this patch.
I'll resubmit with 00-INDEX updates and blackfin moved, as soon as I figure 
out how to tell git to DELETE THE DARN EMPTY DIRECTORIES ALREADY...
(I am seriously suspecting "edit the patch in vi" is going to be part of the 
solution here.  I _like_ mercurial.  I know where to hit it and what with to 
make it behave.  Git, not so much...)
