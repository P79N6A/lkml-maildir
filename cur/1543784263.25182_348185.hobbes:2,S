Thank you for reading my patches!

My patches consist of two parts, one for subcpuset framework
and another for the cpu resource controller.
Subcpuset framework code doesn't have the relation to CKRM.
CKRM could probably use the cpu resource controller code as 
a resource controller of it with some modification.

Yes, subcpusets could work with the dynamic sched domains.
The cpu resource controller divides cpu resources by scaling 
time_slice of the tasks, so multiple subcpusets can be created
under the cpuset that has one cpu only.  So, uniprocessor systems
also could get the benefit of subcpusets-patched cpusets.

That's right.

Right - I don't want the parents of the subcpusets to overlap and 
I should add such checks, but wanted to know first what people would
think of subcpusets.
