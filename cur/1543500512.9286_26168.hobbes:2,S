Hi,
I never installed this conf but I use aic7xxx driver on AHA-2940 so I
have some tips :
- Enable the aic BIOS load on startup;
- Disable BIOS translation for DOS drive > 1 Giga (lilo doesn't like
this)
- Verify the terminations (controller and entire chain : 
remember : only the first and last device should be terminated, do the
termination jumper or software that comes with your device)
Hope it helps,
Sergio Pires
