Hi Mike.
I've cut your initial comments as we are basically saying the same
thing in different words, and I'm just replying to the later comments.

Here in the UK, one pays by the SECOND for telephone calls, and many
modem users look enviously towards the USA and their "Free local
calls"...

I have a very simple policy when it comes to modems: If the customer's
system contains a WinModem, the customer has the option of either
paying for a minimum of 8 hours' work to get it working, or they can
let me replace it with a hardware modem that I supply and pay for 1
hour's work instead, plus the 50 pounds I charge for the modem. The
customer usually makes the right choice...

If I'm advising a customer, I normally tell them to include on the
purchase order the following statement:
 Q> It is required that these computer systems be supplied with a
 Q> modem that is capable of being used reliably when the Windows
 Q> operating system is not in use. Failure to do so will be deemed

It is surprising how much more competent the people doing the
installation become when one does that...

Aren't they just !!!

Basically, my comments at the top were pointing out that there are
two different types of [lw]inmodems, and only those without DSP's are
really crap. True, software that directly addresses a hardware UART
will fail on both types, but the vast majority of modern software uses
the operating system's driver to access them, and in that mode, the
[lw]inmodems with DSP's are no less stable than hardware modems. The
same can not be said of the [lw]inmodems without DSP's though.
Personally, I would never use any type of [lw]inmodem, nor would I
recommend one, as per my comment above, but I believe in being fair to
BOTH sides in a debate like this.

I can happily report that my local /dev/null file is flame resistant!
