This should be "static".

Yes. Please remove printk().

Yes. And it should be ->i_size, not ->mmu_private.

Ditto. This should also be ->i_size. Furthermore, this check should be
under ->i_mutex, otherwise others may expand ->i_size before this already.

Right. And we need to care the limitation on FAT specification (compatibility).
Thanks.
