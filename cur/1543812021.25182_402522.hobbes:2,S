But these are special situations. Placing memory on a distance node
is not beneficial in the standard case of a single threaded process 
churning along opening and closing files etc.
Interleave is only beneficial for special applications that use a common 
pool of data and that implement no other means of locality control. At 
that point we sacrifice the performance benefit that comes with node locality
in order not to overload a single node. 
Kernels before 2.6.16 suffer from special overload situations that are due 
to not having the ability to reclaim the pagecache and the slab cache. 
This is going to change in SLES10.

It seems that we are trying to sacrifice the performance of many in 
order to accomodate a few special situations. Cpusets are ideal for those 
situations since they allow the localization of the interleaving to a 
slice of the machine. Processes on the rest of the box can still get node 
local memory and run at optimal performance.

Please run performance tests with single threaded processes if you 
do not believe me before doing any of this.
