Or because my (hypothetical) business exploded before I had the chance.
After all, you could make the same argument about bandwidth, until you 
get Slashdotted.  Surprise!

That's true, so you may be correct about "less" surprises.  So, it 
depends which is more valuable -- fewer surprises, or fewer limits?
That's not a hypothetical statement, and I don't really know.  I can see 
both sides of this one.  But I do hope that once Reiser4 is stable 
enough for you, it will be predictable enough.

Ok, where's the assertion that symlinks are not backups?  Or not used in 
backup software?  What about directories full of hardlinks -- the dirs 
themselves must use something, right?
Anyway, it wasn't my project that hit this limit.
