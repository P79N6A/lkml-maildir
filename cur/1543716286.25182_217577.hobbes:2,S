Well, this feature is intended to allow power management of appropriate 
devices; using sysfs or a driver call to individually suspend a device 
required for proper system operation would be a danger, hotplug 
notification or no.  And the individual device notifications provided by 
the patch under discussion are not for use during a system-wide 
suspend/resume sequence.  I would imagine system suspend/resume would be 
separate events that probably would not notify of the individual device 
suspends/resumes performed as a consequence.  At any rate, yes, this 
would occur outside of the code path that freezes processes and such.
