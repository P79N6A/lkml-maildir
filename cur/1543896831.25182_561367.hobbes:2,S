The kdump kernel should be normally all <4GB anyways. You won't
need any IOMMU for its IO unless you O_DIRECT/sendfile out of /proc/kcore.
Just don't do that (but I suspect it won't work anyways)
If it's not then swiotlb will also not work because it won't get 
any memory <4GB.
But I doubt this was YH's problem - the panic kernel memory
is always reserved and there shouldn't be any ongoing DMAs in this
area anyways. And what happens outside the kdump kernel shouldn't matter.
I suspect he rather saw problems with non kdump kexec where we
can just shut down the GART properly beforehand.
