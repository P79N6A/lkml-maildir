Please realize that one doesn't need to be dead to become
uncommunicative incapacitated or vanish. The only need to be somewhere
other than where they were without updating anyone. 
Here is a very humorous, but sort of scary theoretical :
"Linus was so disturbed by the code in a submitted patch that he had a
nervous breakdown and spent the next 30 years in a padded room.
Unfortunately, no provisions were left to determine what happens to his
copyrights should he become incapacitated."
That is a LOT different than 
"Linus passed away at age 397 today, and left an appropriate will so his
work remains useful for those enjoying it."
If you are a substantial contributor, address this in a will should you
die and limited power of attorney to someone that you trust should you
fall off the face of the planet. Just like you would see to it that your
assets were properly dispersed if something happened to you.
If your unfortunate enough to not have anyone in your life that you can
trust, you can grant power of attorney to any reputable charitable
organization that you feel mirrors your beliefs and ideals. 
Prevention is so much better than a cure and quite cheap. 
Best,
