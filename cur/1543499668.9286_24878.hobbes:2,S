I was thinking more on the lines of small patches. For example, HP/UX has the
ability to use it's kernel module system to make binary patches to the kernel
itself while it is running. You could, for instance, patch a bug in the
scheduler without requiring a reboot. 
Of course, this is partially possible today with linux if the peice you want to
upgrade is compiled as a module already.
