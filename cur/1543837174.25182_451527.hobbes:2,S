Given the volume of valid email on the LKML it took me all of 3 days  
to get a fresh install of my mail client's bayes filter trained to a  
<5% false negative rate and a <0.5% false positive rate.   
Theoretically a similarly tuned bayes filter on vger with a web- 
interface for people to vote on spamminess would allow us to fix any  
remaining problems; but the spam levels are so low already; why bother?
