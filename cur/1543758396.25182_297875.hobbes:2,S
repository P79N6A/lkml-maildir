Acutally, thats why I changed it to manual readahead. I thought the slowdown comes from some weird 
read-ahead settings. But with the manual read-ahead, this problem appears as well. Its still a 
phenomenon why this slowdown definetly disappears when I raise /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to 
1024000 (until it hits around 4500 sockets) but it seems not to work with smaller or bigger values....

This is a complex code, thats why I really want to avoid this..... Feel free to ask for traces or 
anything you want to know though.
Thanks,
