My method is that the less differences in a merge, the better. I dont mind
if a few comment fixes are lost temporarily, they'll be noticed and
forward ported the minute they get zapped by the backport. (and i have
reviewed -ac for ac-only functional fixes, none existed.) This way the
actual code creation part of the backport was a few minutes work only -
the real work mostly involved reviewing the functional parts of the
changes.
