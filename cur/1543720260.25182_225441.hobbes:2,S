getpid() is only used in bad benchmarks these days, exactly because 
caching of "pid" has been done for a long time. Every single microkernel 
OS ever built did it, I think.
So yes, you'll find some broken benchmarks using getpid(), but nobody sane 
would take those benchmarks seriously anyway. If you want _real_ system 
call performance measurements, use something like lmbench, which does:
 - getppid() - same cost as getpid(), except you can't just cache the
   results on any POSIX OS (well, you could, but it's more complex:
   you end up having to map the uarea-equvalent into user space or have 
   some notifier for the parent dying).
 - read/write: a hell of a lot more important than the simple system calls 
   anyway.
 - open/close/stat/fstat: very common system calls with interesting 
   performance issues.
That gives you some _real_ data.

I think some threading libraries historically used hashes of the
thread-specific pid to look up the thread-specific data. But since glibc
shows the same pid for all regular threads, and gets the pid wrong for
other threads, that's clearly _not_ a valid reason for caching it either.
