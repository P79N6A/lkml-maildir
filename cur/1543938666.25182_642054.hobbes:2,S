Hi, Andrea,
I took a quick look at the patches and it looks like we throttle
network (by forcing a schedule_timeout()), if we exceed our bandwidth
limit. That is one way of doing it, but it has some disadvantages, it
does not scale to 
1. Implementation of soft limits (limit on contention of resource)
   gets harder
2. Why dont use the existing infrastructure for bandwidth limitation
   for implementing the network controller?
