I'm pretty sure changing the value of PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY will not help
in this case.  PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY becomes increasingly important as
the number of running tasks is increased.  In the case of simply running
one task (like gzip) on your 2 CPU system, I don't think it will make
any difference.
