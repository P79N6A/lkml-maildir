When, oh when will people learn that this is just not possible in general?
And for those things in Windows where the "Microsoft Fix" works (1.  
Restart computer 2. If that doesn't work, re-install), well, you *can* do  
the same on Linux. I think it's silly, but it's certainly possible.
Oh, and Linux gives exactly the same amount of clues as Windows wrt. when  
to apply this "fix": none.
Of course, there are things where the Microsoft Fix doesn't work at all -  
flaky hardware, programming bugs, data overflowing disk, network  
congestion, any number of things. Which brings us back to the beginning:  
you simply cannot fix most problems until you understand at least partly  
what is going wrong in the first place.

Since, given Linux, that screen would probably be showing X, it's not very  
likely that the customer would get to see that message anyway. Or do you  
expect a travel agent would have xconsole showing?
