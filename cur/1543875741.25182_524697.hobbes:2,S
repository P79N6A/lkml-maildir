What Seagate is it?  (hdparm -I /dev/sda | head)
I have this one:
ATA device, with non-removable media
        Model Number:       ST380817AS
        Serial Number:      4MR08EK8
        Firmware Revision:  3.42
and it gives problems with NCQ enabled.
Try turning NCQ off with:
	echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/queue_depth
