Well, I know something that might be interesting for kernel newbies
including students. So let me share it with you.
It's Ubuntu 7.04 based LiveCD with TOMOYO Linux kernel.
Directions:
1. visit the following URL and save ISO image
    
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/wiki-e/?TomoyoLive
2. burn CD/DVD and boot from the disc
    (or start up VM from the downloaded image)
3. open "TOOMYO Linux Policy Editor" icon on the gnome desktop
4. browse "domains" with cursor keys
    you can see how processes were created (great experience)
5. choose a domain and enter return key
    you can see the behavior of the selected "domain" (ACL mode)
6. enter return to step 5 (domain transition mode)
    (repeat 5-7 as you like, type 'r' to refresh screen)
7. enter q to quit the editpolicy program
As it's LiveCD like KNOPPIX, hard disks will not be
affected unless you mount them and operate with intention.
I mean, it's safe to play with.
What makes all of these possible is "TOMOYO Linux",
but you don't have to understand it. ;)
No policy definition, preparation, knowledge or hustle is
required.
If you are interested in TOMOYO Linux (just in case...),
please visit our Wiki page.
