Hi,
There was a minor change to the format of /proc/cpuinfo which hoses
several programs.  Most notably is vmware. 
The details are the field formerly known as 'flags' is now known as
'features' which breaks any programs attempting to parse /proc/cpuinfo
and making decisions about what feature set the cpu supports.  
I'm not quite sure why the name change is necessary, and even if one
wants to keep the name change there is a discontunity of cpuinfo formats
and programs which intend to run on kernels 2.2 and 2.4 needs to know
this...
Here is a small patch to save your typing fingers:
