Hi
Up to 2.4.19-rc1 my system worked fine but 2.4.19 and 2.4.20-pre1 produce
the following message at startup:
Mounting root filesystem
ide-floppy driver 0.99.newide
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k ide-cd, errno = 2
hda: driver not present
mount: error 6 mounting ext3
pivotroot: pivot_root(/sysroot,/sysroot/initrd) failed: 2
Freeing unused kernel memory: 108k freed
Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel.
I have no idea what causes the problem since I did not change the kernel
configuration.
The system configuration is as follows:
Athlon XP 1600+
Asus A7V266-E (VIA KT266A)
512MB RAM
hda, hdc are IDE Harddisks
Any suggestions welcome.
