Yes that I understand and it works right up until the jiffie count wraps.
But now we have people adding cost to everything else just so we can all
have good uptime values.  Since AFIK the drivers handle the wrap cleanly
the only thing that it bothers is the uptime stats.
Now we have people making jiffies more expensive just to deal with uptime.
At least as far as I can see it should just be easier/better to make
uptime use something else.
Or am I completly off base?
