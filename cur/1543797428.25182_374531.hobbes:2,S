+void smp_send_timer_broadcast_ipi(struct pt_regs *regs);
This is called by the IRQ0 timer interrupt handler, to check whether any CPUs 
have enrolled for this broadcast.
+void switch_APIC_timer_to_ipi(void *cpumask);
Called by acpi processor driver when it find out that a particular CPU can
support C3 state (and it is an Intel CPU).
+void switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer(void *cpumask);
Called by acpi processor driver again to reset to APIC_timer when C3 is not 
supported by the CPU.
The acpi processor driver calls can be at the boot time, or can be at run time
if BIOS enables/disables C3 at run time.
