Or add a small bit of infrastructure that errors writes at make_request 
if you don't have a magic "i am a direct block device write from 
userspace" flag on the bio.
The hibernate may fail, but you don't corrupt the media.
If you don't get the image out, resume back to the "this is resume" 
instead of the power-down path.

Why?  You don't expect suspend-to-ram in drivers to be implemented?  We 
need more speperation of the quiesce drivers from power-down devices?
Note that we are just talking about "suspend devices and put their 
state in ram", not actually invoking the platform to suspend to ram.
And I'm actually saying we free memory and maybe allocate disk blocks 
for the save before we suspend (see below).

Yes.  I would argue writing to existing blocks of a file (not thorugh 
the filesystem, just getting their blocsk from the file system) should 
be safe, but it occurs to me that may not be the case if your fsck and 
bmap move data blocks from some update log to the file system.
But we know the (maximum) image size.   So we could allocate the blocks 
in the first image before suspending the drivers and memory 
allocations, and supplying the list to the second kernel.  We could 
even write to the first block with a signature "suspend to here", or 
even the whole block list to the beginning (it will have to be saved to 
disk for restore anyways).

If we use the "write to these blocks" then this is as easy as writing 
to a file in a mounted filesystem.

With my allocate memory as a task and don't save that task's memory 
approach, we can get to this point while userspace is running.   It 
could be controllled by userspace, or even be userspace 
(sys_do_not_save_me() waits for resume, and dies as the kernel 
resumes).

It means you are committed to suspend before you try to shrink memory.  
What happens when the user requested a smaller image that memory in 
use?

Yes.  As I said, adding a compress as we copy the pages into the saving

As I said, I see kjump as a way to solve the "ok i am at a save point, 
now how do I write this image to media without allowing any other io".  
As you know by now, my solution for ACPI support is after the image is 
written we go back to the kernel that started the suspend and it puts 
the machine in S4.
If this works, we get down to 1 hibernate implementation in the kernel 
:-).
