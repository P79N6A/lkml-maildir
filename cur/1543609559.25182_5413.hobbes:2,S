Feeping creaturism.  Sure we could compile it in unconditionally... 
embedded people will grab matt's patch which allows conditional
compilation and use that instead, as will people who aren't using
crc32-related features.
The list of modules including crc32.o is definitely ugly but its just
more kernel bloat for those who don't need it.
