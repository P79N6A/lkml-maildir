Cool.  If someone is willing to pick one up and maintain this fairly 
trivial amount of code we can resurrect it; given that the code had been 
broken for several releases seem to indicate noone really cares.
(Also note that the removal will not prevent the kernel from actually 
running on these chips; in fact, it might actually make them work.)
