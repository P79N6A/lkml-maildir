Looking at this a bit further, I realised that when the sound driver was
compiled in the kernel, it is initialised before ACPI.  The BIOS has
assigned IRQ9 to ACPI, but the PCI code does not know this because of:
PCI: 00:07.3: class 604 doesn't match header type 00. Ignoring class. 
The ISAPnP code then assigns IRQ9 to the sound card, causing the ACPI
code to fail to allocate it.  If I compile sound as a module then the
ACPI driver grabs IRQ9 and the sound get IRQ7.
