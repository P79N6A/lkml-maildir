I thought about it, but I do not like CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL as a concept.
I seem to recall a few instances when it was practically required, because
some necessary driver was covered by it, and so users ran it always-on.
AFAIK, both Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Beta have it enabled
for that reason. We can try it, certainly, to see if it helps.
