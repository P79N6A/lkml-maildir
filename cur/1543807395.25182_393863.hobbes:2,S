ok, i think i got that. Could you perhaps outline two actual use-cases 
that would need two cpusets with different policies, on the same box? Or 
would you set the spread-out policy for every cpuset that is used in a 
box with lots of cpusets, to achieve fairness? (and not bother about it 
on boxes with dedicated workloads)
