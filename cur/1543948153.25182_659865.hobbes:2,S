depmod/modinfo/insmod/modprobe know only if you compile 
module-init-tools with zlib support.
And what about the busybox versions?
A different name would e.g.:
- easily allow proper error handling if the userspace modules program 
  doesn't support the compression used
- better scale to support additional compressions
- give the user a hint what is happening and what might be the problem
  when anythig goes wrong
