Hello,
I've written a small kernel module & shared object for kernel 2.6 to
enable the following for normal users:
- inb()/outb()... via a wrapper function
- enable direct IO access (like ioperm())
- direct access on physical memory addresses
- installation of user space ISR
- change nice level
The module is primary thought for education, but perhaps also helpful
in software development.
The module is finished now, but because it's my first kernel code
there could be something to improve. If anyone wants to test, just
send me a mail and you'll get the code.
Thanks,
Marko Euth
