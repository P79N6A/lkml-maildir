It is well known chicken and egg problem about IPv6 IPsec.
You can bypass ICMP packet with putting ICMP bypass policies before
your own policies.
Then you can not trigger IPsec with ICMP ECHO.
spdadd fec0::204:75ff:feab:6fcc fec0::2 ipv6-icmp -P out none;
spdadd fec0::204:75ff:feab:6fcc fec0::2 ipv6-icmp -P in none;
spdadd fec0::204:75ff:feab:6fcc fec0::2 any -P out ipsec
esp/transport//require ah/transport//require;
spdadd fec0::2 fec0::204:75ff:feab:6fcc any -P in  ipsec
esp/transport//require ah/transport//require;
