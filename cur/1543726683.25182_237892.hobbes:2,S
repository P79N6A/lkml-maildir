the first versions were - i could even reproduce it. Fixed it up by doing
less work in this function. But i like your solution of rotating the list
too. Anyway, the -M5 patch shouldnt be livelockable. (but it might have
the crash problem).
btw., breaking the outer loop here is not enough for latencies, it needs
to happen in the inner loop. (which can take thousands of iterations too.)  
See the checkpoint.c bits of the -M5 patch:
