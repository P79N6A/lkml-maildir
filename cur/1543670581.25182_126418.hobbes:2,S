Good call.
Although I suspect you need about a million interrupt sources to hit
this, since FIRST_SYSTEM_VECTOR is somethign like 0xef, and thus you can
hit it only when "offset" has already been incremented seven times
(which implies that we've walked the whole vector space quite a few
times by then).
Did you actually see this on hardware?
Anyway, applied as obvious.
