"git-blame include/linux/sched.h" gives you that information, it was 
added by me as part of CFS:

because some people wanted even lower priorities than what nice +19 
gave, and extending nice levels wasnt possible for ABI reasons.

SCHED_BATCH can still have nice levels from -20 to +19, it is a modified 
SCHED_OTHER/SCHED_NORMAL for "throughput oriented" workloads.
SCHED_IDLE overrides the nice settings and it means a "super idle" 
workload.
