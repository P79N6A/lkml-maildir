Also it has nothing at all to do with the kernel. It's what `ls`
or some other directory-reading program provides for the user.
People often forget that PATH, `pwd`, etc., are just filter
components!
When you `cd` to somewhere, your location hasn't changed at
all!
Without involving the kernel, one can make any kind of filter
to cause any sort of display that you want.
