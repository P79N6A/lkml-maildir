You, sure.  But you are not the only user of the ia64 port just
as I am not the only user of the sparc64 port and if sparc64 generated
diagnostic messages not useful to people other than me I'd have to
quiet them by default.
All I'm suggesting is provide a way to control the kernel unaligned
accesses message and default it to off.
