Ok how about the scenario i'm seeing. The cdrom is spewing constant I/O 
errors and we go and check on these, they are actually _not_ in fact 
taking a long time and actually preempting each other! Looking at the 
code and the usage of ide_preempt, my guess is that checking the status is 
a higher priority hence the queue jumping. How can we use a timer for this 
one?
Thanks,
