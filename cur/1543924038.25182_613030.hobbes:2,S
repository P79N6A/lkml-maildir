We are both half-right.  I reverted my version of that completely, 
applied your version verbatim, and pushed it upstream.  The result: 
atapi_xlat _did_ start programming lbam/lbah for DMA (another behavior 
change), but request-sense DMA path was not changed to program lba[mh] 
for DMA.

No, that's precisely the problem cause for what Daniel is reporting.  We 
are setting blimit=xfer_len(==10), when the device wants to return more 
than 10 bytes.  When set to the old limit (8k), the problem didn't occur.
Prior to this change, __atapi_pio_bytes() happily discarded trailing 
data, so the software already knows how to eat trailing data left to us 
by the ATAPI device.  The printk (and lack of problem) indicated that 
this code was active and working fine.
