Some comments:
Renicing X at -20 is silly. It is normal that xmms skips when
X is reniced because X gets the cpu time not xmms.
Also a normal user doesn't have access to nice values below
zero, so the scheduler should work for normal systems not
for those in which process foo is reniced at -bar priority.
