Subject: Hard lock with a CD-R and k3b

I have a CD-R that makes linux lock hard when I start k3b. I copied these
messages from the console by hand (I hope there are no errors). NB: these
are not kernel messages (there's nothing in the logs and sysrq doesn't
work). This is what k3b prints and I'm aware it's not very useful:
[...]
Diskinfo:
	mediatype:		CD-R
	current profile:	CD-R
	disk state:		incomplete
	empty:			false
	rewritable:		false

	tracvks:		4
	layers:			1
	capacity:		... LBA 336601 ...

(k3bdevice::device) /dec/hdf:	READ DVD STRUCTURE length det failed
<BOOM>
I'll try the same CD with other kernel versions/archictures. In the
meantime, have you any hints ?
