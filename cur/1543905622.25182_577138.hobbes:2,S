Subject: [PATCH] create CONFIG_SUSPEND_UP_POSSIBLE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/30/542

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Without this change, it is possible to build CONFIG_HIBERNATE
on all !SMP architectures, but not necessarily their SMP versions.
I don't know for sure if the architecture list under SUSPEND_UP_POSSIBLE
is correct.  For now it simply matches the list for SUSPEND_SMP_POSSIBLE.
