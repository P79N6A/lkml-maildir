True, they were primarily designed for the SNMP counters in networking
(as per your comment in snmp.h).  They're now dynamic per-cpu pointers,
which adds a new wrinkle though 8(

Mainly that it makes more sense to use the existing per-cpu concept than
introduce another kind of per-cpu var within a special structure, but
it's also more efficient (see other post).  Hopefully it will spark
interest in making dynamic-percpu pointers use the same offset scheme,
now x86 will experience the benefits.
And we might even get a third user of local_t!
Cheers,
Rusty.
