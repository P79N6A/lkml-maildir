Nway is in for all chips except the 2104[01] in which it was either not
implemented on the chip or broken on the chip.

Anyone who can't get de4x5 to work for them merely switches to tulip.c
(or vice versa). I would point out that there are many instances where
de4x5 has worked for people where tulip.c hasn't. 
Still if there's an issue of kernel bloat and one driver has to go, I'd
reluctantly suggest the de4x5 goes only for the reasons outlined above:
that I can't spend time developing and testing into the forseeable
future due to other commitments. But then try explaining that to
existing users...

Amen to that!

Your example (media sense algorithm barfing) unfortunately highlights a
real problem: reliance on other hardware to do the Right Thing. There's
a lot of broken PHY/MAC chips out there and autosense/Nway is no
exception - it even included the DECchips when they were first out (but
still in use). The media sense algorithms are bound to break with some
hardware combinations without special casing them, which makes the
driver even less understandable (look at the "official" DEC driver
source code from Digital [R.I.P.] to see what I mean).
