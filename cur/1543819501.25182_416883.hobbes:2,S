Greetings All.
I've found a strange phenomenon associated with capabilities. It seems to be a
quantum like.
when I run (as root)
delfin:~# /usr/sbin/execcap '= cap_net_raw=ep' /bin/sh -c 'getpcaps $$'
Capabilities for `2438': =ep cap_setpcap-ep
I don't know what really happens to those capablities I zero. And I can't really
figure out for when I try the wavefunction collapses
delfin:~# strace -o /dev/null /usr/sbin/execcap '= cap_net_raw=ep' /bin/sh -c \
'getpcaps $$'
Capabilities for `2461': = cap_net_raw+ep
Strange isn't it? Does it mean that processes can't really drop their privileges?
please CC.
