I've looked at phhttpd only, and it actually does not use si_band at all,
but it uses si_fd, but as on Alpha si_band is first:
                /* SIGPOLL */
                struct {
                        int _band;      /* POLL_IN, POLL_OUT, POLL_MSG */
                        int _fd;
                } _sigpoll;
changing it to long would move si_fd.
Alternatively, if we could be sure noone uses si_band anywhere, alpha could
do:
                /* SIGPOLL */
                struct {
			int _dummy;
                        int _fd;
                        long _band;      /* POLL_IN, POLL_OUT, POLL_MSG */
                } _sigpoll;
Cheers,
