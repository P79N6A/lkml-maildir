Or if you want to run a proceess slower, the page containing tsc
calibration info is changed.

No, you can hide the networked clock :-)
OTOH I believe disassembling the call will happen with some run time
systems in the future, not because they're trying to get at the "true"
time, but as a natural evolution of dynamic compilation technologies.
Ok, it could be prevented: "thou shalt not mimic the vsyscall code".
But there is a little execution speed to be gained from permitting it.
