In theory, yes, and I'd expect them to end up going that way, but for
initial development, I wouldn't recommend that course...

If what I've heard of WinModems is accurate, then "gcc -lm" will
probably be a big advantage...and I don't believe that's allowed in
the kernel...

NIL (I'm allergic to Caffeine, so have to avoid it).

I would see something like this being developed starting with the core
engine, which development doesn't even need the WinModme to be
present. That part could easily be developed as a userland tool with
the full userland debugging facilities.
Once THAT has been done, one can consider turning it into a kernel
module that talks to the WinModem, but there's no point doing that
beforehand...

True, but get the core developed first, THEN look into that once you
know what you're talking about...

If there is, it's less than persuasive - IMHO doing so would be akin
to shooting oneself in the toes...

My preference would be to have an ioctl interface for configuring the
driver and a userspace tool that intercepts AT sequences and turns
them into the appropriate ioctl's. That way, we reduce the likelihood
of commercial software houses turning away from Linux because of its
"non-standard" modem interface.
Best wishes from Riley.
