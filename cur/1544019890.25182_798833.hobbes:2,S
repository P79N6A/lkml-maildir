While working on an NMI watchdog implementation on sparc64
I noticed what seems to be a peculiar behavior of the NMI
timer int oprofile support on x86.
When the NMI watchdog tests itself at boot timer we start
with nmi_hz equal to HZ.
After the NMI watchdog self-test passes, nmi_hz is reduced
down to '1'.
The NMI timer int oprofile support simply uses DIE_NMI notifiers for
it's implementation.  But I don't see anything in the code of
arch/x86/oprofile/nmi_timer_int.c nor the NMI watchdog infrastructure
which will re-adjust nmi_hz back to HZ or something similar.
Am I missing something?
