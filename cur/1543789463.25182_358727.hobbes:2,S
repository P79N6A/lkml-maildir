Hi, Steve:
    I read carefully code about it in arch/i386/kernel/irq.c. Follow is
my understand on it:
    When we disabled/undefined CONFIG_4KSTACK, IOW, we use more bigger 
kernel stack,
the interrupt handler will use kernel stack of current task quietly at 
this time,
elsewise, the the interrupt handler will use 
&hardirq_stack[current_cpu_num*THREAD_SIZE]
as its kernel stack, and beacause of interrupt is disabled when one 
interrupt is
handling (on i386 architecture at least), so although this kernel stack 
of interrupt is
static allocated, we still do not need care we only have one this stack.
    Of course, our kernel stack at all time is page aligned. so current 
macro can work
normally.
    While I already thanks Steve N times :) , I still send my thanks to 
him again.
