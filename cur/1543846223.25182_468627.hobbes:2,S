It seems to lock up in the nvidia fb driver. Can you disable that
and if that helps contact the maintainer of it?
It might be also just the MTRR so possibly booting 
with video=nvidiafb:nomtrr might help too.

If you have a ieee1394 port and a cable you can use firescope
from a second box (
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/firescope/
) 
If it crashes late enough at boot you can use ethernet netconsole
(/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt) 
Or a lot of people use a digital camera to photograph the oopses.
If you do that make sure to either use frame buffer with a small
font or CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y vga=ask select smallest resolution possible,
otherwise the oopses typically don't fit on the screen.  
.jpgs should be only last resort though, the other options
are definitely preferred.
