I don't think this addresses the scatter-gather case I mentioned above.
Or if we are, we've rewritten ALSA before hand to use Linux scatterlists
along side several dma_alloc_coherent mappings and have the ability to
mmap these as well.
Remember that we're fond of telling driver writers to use scatter gather
lists rather than grabbing one large contiguous memory chunk...  So
they did exactly as we told them.  Using pci_alloc_consistent and/or
dma_alloc_coherent and built their own scatter lists.
