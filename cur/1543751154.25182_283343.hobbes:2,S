Subject: PROBLEM: changing ownership of directory with reiserfs mounted inside

I was trying to change ownership of directory where I have reiserfs
mounted (I was preparing it for squid cache dir). Under 2.6.10 and up
to 2.6.10-bk5 (and 2.6.10-ac4 too) everything works as it should, but 
when I tried to do it under 2.6.10-bk7 (or bk8) chown suspended. This
bug is very simple to reproduct - just mount reiserfs into directory
and then try to change ownership of that directory. Something must
have happened between bk5 and bk7.
Keywords: kernel, reiserfs, chown
