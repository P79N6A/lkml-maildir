Yes, that's exactly the "good" kind of DRM. A few things are
special in your case, though:
 - the "rights owner" and the "user" are the same person
 - the "user" can be trusted
 - you control your firmware
Does TCPA (I suppose that's what Linus' endorsement of DRM is
about) even have the concept of user-installed keys or
certificates ?
