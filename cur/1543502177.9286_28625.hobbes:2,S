 Well, in that case you could use 0xa, which is handled by all i386 and
newer BIOSes, AFAIK, and requires less messing.  Neither are safe, anyway,
because they require RAM contents to be valid which might not be the case.
And executing from clobbered RAM mau cause further destruction -- e.g.
some unwanted hard disk writes.

 Writing "to recover" I meant to start the boot loader, which might in
turn dump the memory to swap, for example, just as it's done by OSes for
non-ia32 platforms.

 You still are not sure all components are back to whatever settings BIOS
would like to use.  Note that for the case of a floppy you might need to
set up some values within BIOS data area, not only interrupt vectors.
