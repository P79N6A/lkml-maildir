In this case it's actually gcc's fault to ignore the unlikely(), so the 
optimization would have made the code slower at least on some 
architectures.
But more important, it resulted in build errors on i386 and some other 
32bit architectures.
The underlying (and unresolved) issue is that gcc expects libgcc to be 
available while the kernel does not link with libgcc on many platforms.
