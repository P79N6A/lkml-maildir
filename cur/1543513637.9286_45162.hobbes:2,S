I've always used de4x5 without any problem because tulip driver
maintenance
have been suboptimal (specially in regard to SMP)
when driver maintenance becomes messy... expect some of us to
vote for the better maintained driver with our feet...
this is not to critisize mr. becker abilities nor expertise
with drivers but there is a certain lack of understanding 
regarding integration into mainstream kernel, i must say!
and do not forget that linux is bound to open source development
and 'peer review' without this we would be building another
