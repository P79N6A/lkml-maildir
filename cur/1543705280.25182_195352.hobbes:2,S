It would seem that there is a problem having the system know which two 
times to believe. Given that I set time from a good source in rc.local, 
it would be nice to have the system know that the correct and unchanging 
btime is NOW-uptime. And to make that assumption it would have to be 
told in some way that the btime should be calculated and treated as 
unchanging. On other systems a standard may never be used, or the 
standard mey be the local cable guide (most have a time).
A good thing to consider if you care, I guess right after setting to a 
trusted clock I might want to save the btime somewhere.
