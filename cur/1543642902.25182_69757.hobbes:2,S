I can no longer use setkeycodes to customize my keyboard layout.  It
stopped working with the new input layer.  showkey also no longer shows
scan codes.
I usually use setkeycodes for about 10 keys.  Now 9 of the calls have no
effect and the 10th changes the actual scan code for the letter 'w' not
the key code.
Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?  Is there some kernel option I missed
that allows it? or an alternate way to do it?  I haven't noticed anyone
else having the same trouble.
