pci_for_each_dev() is currently a macro, not a function, and I'm trying
to get rid of all public access to the pci lists.  The majority of pci
drivers use the pci_find_device() function in just the way that I
converted the few remaining users of pci_for_each_dev() to (yeah, "few"
is a relative number, but check out how many people call
pci_find_device()...)
I guess I could create this to clean it up a bit:
#define pci_find_all_devices(dev)	pci_find_device(PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, dev)
but that's really not that much of a change...
thanks,
