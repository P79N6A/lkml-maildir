Actually, I came to think of this after posting to the list earlier
today. I take it that device drivers needs to be PCI hot-plug aware in
order to make them work in h-p environments? If this is the case, it
should be perfectly valid to require the h-p aware driver to keep the
PCI device info for it's device in the driver.
