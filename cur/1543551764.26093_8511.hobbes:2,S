Yes.  In practice the usual question is whether the compiler will
evaluate the operands from left to right or from right to left,
but the compiler is within its rights to evaluate the operands in
any order it wants.

Good sigmonster, have $TREAT.

I agree with you and Al Viro that the proposed fixes were less
than desirable.
