Well, it shouldn't be.  forget_original_parent should update
real_parent for every child on either list, and then zap_thread unlinks
each child from the current parent and links it to the new real_parent.
A couple of printks in there should be able to work out if I'm wrong,
though...

As Linus points out, typo right there on the last argument.
