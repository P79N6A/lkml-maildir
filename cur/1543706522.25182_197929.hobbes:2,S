	The problem is that in fib_rules.c there is an attempt to
skb_put() a negative increment. Which is OK on platforms where sizeof(unsigned)
== sizeof(void *). skb_put() has its second argument as unsigned int,
so instead of adding a -36 bytes here, it adds 4294967260 bytes to the
skb->tail, which extends it further than skb->end, which causes the
BUG() I have mentioned. The solution would be to change the argument
of skb_put() and friends to be either long or signed int, or to call
skb_trim() instead of skb_put in fib_rules.c instead.
	I suggest the following patch, but all occurences of
nlmsg_failure: and rtattr_failure: labels should be checked for a similar
problem.

Please apply or let me know what the proper fix should be.
