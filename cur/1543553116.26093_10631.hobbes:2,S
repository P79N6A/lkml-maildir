Nice! Now run that (i386 optimized?) beast on a machine that works
different (latest K7s perhaps?), and many optimizations break.
When you got that fixed, would you please port it to Alpha?
Sure, using C (with a not-overly-bright compiler) has a non-negligible
cost. But huge benefits too. The whole of software (including OS) design is
an excercise in delicate juggling among conflicting goals. Had Linus gone
down the "all-assembler, bummed to its limits" route, Linux would have been
dead by 0.03 or so, depending on the stubborness of its creator to be sure.
