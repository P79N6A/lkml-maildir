Hello,
Looking at the thread of Interl Dual-core and 4GB a sudden thought came 
to my mind: "Hey, I'm gonna upgrade my box to 4G next week too... Would 
it work?"
Thus, the question - would I be able to use whole 4G RAM with dual-core 
amd and kernel with SMP compiled for i686?
Thanks in advance!
Vladimir
