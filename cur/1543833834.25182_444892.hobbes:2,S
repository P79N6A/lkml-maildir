Hello,
Kexec skips video initialization code and because of that framebuffer
does not work with relocated kernels.
Like Eric W. Biederman pointed out in
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0508.0/1674.html
 ,
screen_info structure from include/linux/tty.h must be passed along to
maintain current video mode.
I made some testing and it's enough to dump screen_info structure from
running kernel and overwrite this info in kexec' x86-linux-setup.c.
I am wondering what would be the preferred method to extract screen_info
from running kernel. Should this be made available from sysfs or maybe a
new system call be created?
