Subject: [PATCH] Improved CPU detection/handling in 2.4

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There are a few things missing from the x86 setup code in test9
which have been present in 2.2.18pre for a while.
I've forward ported these, and added some extra missing things
and put up a patch at..
ftp.suse.com/pub/people/davej/kernel/2.4/test9/setupfixes-1.diff
It contains..
 : Pentium IV detection/workaround/enhancement
 : Cyrix III detection/enhancement
 : Removed duplicated cache size reporting routine
 : Two extra routines marked as __init
 : Some other small housekeeping changes.
Please test, and let me know if I broke anything.
regards,
Dave.
