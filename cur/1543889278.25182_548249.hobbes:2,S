Gerco,
Please read the FAQ at

There you will notice that use of Linux KERNEL does not mean that
your must publish sources for your proprietary application, or to
make it easy for somebody to make a distribution competeting with
yours.  People like Oracle have realized this a long ago, and are
selling their commercial products also for Linux platform.
Google has made available all parts of the system that they are
obliged under GPL to make available.  
Perhaps person supplying the reply from Google didn't quite understand
what the product is, and that it has lots of components where you
can get sources for, although nothing exiting and special happens
in them.  A better reply from Google would have been:
    "The GSA is made of a branded PC hardware, Linux operating
     system (sources of components available) plus proprietary
     Google search engine suite."
