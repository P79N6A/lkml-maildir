aha! This is interesting. When epoll seems to go wrong, the
epoll_event.data of the second event is unwritten, but the .events field
is zeroed. Sometimes though, the final call to epoll_wait() returns just
one event instead of the two, and in that case, the high 32 bits of the
first epoll_event.data are unwritten. The lower 32 bits contain the
right data, and as the code treats this as a (int) FD, the top 32 bits
are discarded anyway.
Drat! I've just looked back at the kernel headers and noticed the
following, prior to the epoll_event definition:
/*
 * On x86-64 make the 64bit structure have the same alignment as the
 * 32bit structure. This makes 32bit emulation easier.
 */
#ifdef __x86_64__
#define EPOLL_PACKED __attribute__((packed))
#else
#define EPOLL_PACKED
#endif
struct epoll_event {
        __u32 events;
        __u64 data;
} EPOLL_PACKED;
Now, my code can't pull in the kernel headers so it has its own
epoll_event definition, which is missing the packed attribute. D'oh!
Guess what, everything works properly when I add it in. Looks like this
bug has been of my own making all along...
Sorry for taking up your time!
