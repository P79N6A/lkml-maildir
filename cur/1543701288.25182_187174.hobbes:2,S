[PATCH] I2C: Fix SCx200 dependancies
The following patch fixes incorrect dependencies (as far as I can see)
for the SCx200 modules. A similar patch (with even more fixes) is also
needed for Linux 2.4, and will be part of my next wave to Marcelo. Note
that I don't have the necessary hardware to actually test anything, but
a quick look at the code doesn't leave much place for doubt IMHO.
