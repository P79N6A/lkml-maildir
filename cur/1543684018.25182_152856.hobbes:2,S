in the ol' BP6 times (dual Celeron) APIC errors
where reported (by certain 2.4.x kernels, previous
versions simply ignored them) when an error occured
while the CPUs where communicating ...
as far as I understood, the communication between
APIC and CPU is checksummed (a very simple checksum,
like a parity) and if this checksum is invalid, the
action is restarted, so this okay, because an error
was avoided, but because the checksum is so simple
(IIRC only two bits), chances are good that some 
faulty communication will go undetected ...
please, I'm no expert on Athlon APIC or such stuff,
so this could be total bullshit, but maybe some
APIC expert will comment on that ;)
best,
Herbert
