/sbin/kexec will load it with sys_kexec_load, before the kernel becomes
sick.

Exactly.  That is where the SHA hash and all of the features will
go in the new ``kernel''.  What we are exec is an arbitrary
stand-alone program.  I suspect a SHA hash generator and checker
is something we can easily add as a wrapper.

The only process that is going to be changed around is where
we store the kernel before we transfer control to it, and when/and
how that transfer of control happens.
The beauty of kexec is all of these fun things become user 
problems from the point of the view of the sick kernel so
it does not need to worry about them.
I will be happy to see a SHA patch for /sbin/kexec.
