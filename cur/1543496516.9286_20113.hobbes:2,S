(please forgive any line wraps above)
It took an email I sent 27 hours to return to me.  Looking at the headers, it
appears that vger sat on the email almost 90%(est) of the time.  The vger
setup may have the best exploder config in the world, but if the main machine
isn't dolling them out fast enough, what is the point?
I know this comes up every so often, and usually cvs is just turned off, until
the queue has time to catch up.  That doesn't fix the problem, tho.  Cvs and
these lists should not be on the same box.  cvs should not be on a box with
anything else(should cvs even be?).
Adam(very aggravated that kernel development is so hampered)
