Probably not.  And that is legitimate...

No but we will be running in the first 16M of memory.  The 16M that
is allocated is currently used to hold a copy of the low 16M.

Which makes them both safe and worthless.  On the normal kexec path
they we will need to get them written though.

Well if calling shutdown is not really usable, then I we had better
transition quickly beyond using it...

The problem is that we really won't be using it for running code out
of because of i386 kernel limitations.  Unless someone can tell
my why 0 -16MB won't have DMA traffic in them.  Or how to run a kernel
at an address other than 1MB.
I suspect we can play with the initial page tables and how virtual
addresses map to physical addresses and fairly simply generate a
relocatable kernel.  I have not had a chance to investigate that
though.  Once we have that it will be trivial to run out of the
reserved 16M and many of the practical problems melt away.
