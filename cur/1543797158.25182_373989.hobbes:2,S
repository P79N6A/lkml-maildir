Then may I ask how XP does it?  I have to dual boot between XP and Fedora.  
When I go into XP's device manager I see all of the appropriate hardware 
listed, no extra serial ports.  When I boot into Fedora and go into /dev, I 
see the same hardware except I have 32 serial ports and 64 tty nodes (tty is 
for virtual terminals right?).  How can 1 OS show the correct number and 
another show the wrong number?  I ask so I can better understand what is 
going on.
Thanks,
Jason
