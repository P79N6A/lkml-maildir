 right.. the link was to 0/6 of the patchset, which is
 actually only the introduction. real patch was in subsequent
 messages.

 If I'm not wrong, the RTC is usually queried at bootup
 and written to on shutdown. If NTP mode is active, 
 it is also written every 11 minutes.
 So my intention was to emulate that interface as a starting
 point. Then we can update the userspace utilities (hwclock)
 to let the user choose which clock he want to use.
 I guess /proc/driver/rtc will be deprecated sooner or
 later. The /dev/rtc interface only supports one clock.
 It can either be extended to have /dev/rtcX or we
 can extend the sysfs one to allow clock updating.
 NTP mode could then be adjusted to update one or more
 of the rtcs. Maybe each RTC could have an attribute
 (let's say /sys/class/rtc/rtcX/ntp) which tells the
 kernel whether to update it or not.
 This way we will not have a primary clock anymore.

 -EPERM ? -EACCESS? :)
