Since i upgraded my computer recently it's difficult to compare with the
experiments i made before. But basically no, i haven't tried to make
xine smooth under high load. my primary complain was that even a small
background load caused by KSysGuard (KDE system monitor) could make it
drop frames from time to time. with nice values like -2 the problem was
completely fixed.
