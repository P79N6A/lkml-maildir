klist is quite different in that it locks the whole list. The proposed
data structure locks each edge, that is it will allow concurrent
deletion of elements as long as they don't share neighbours.

Getting rid of the s_files list like you proposed would of course be a
much better solution, and I'll look into that.
Not having the VFS knowledge you do I just smashed the lock and kept
current semantics.
