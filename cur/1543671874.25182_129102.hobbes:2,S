I also have an Inspiron, the 8200.  I am using one mouse device in X, 
/dev/input/mice and a USB mouse at times.  My glidepoint, stick, and USB 
mouse all work.  USB mouse can be unplugged/replugged at any time and 
still works.
This is with 2.5.67, 2.5.68 wants to immediately reboot on me.
Have you tried 2.5.67?  If not, are you interested in my .config?
