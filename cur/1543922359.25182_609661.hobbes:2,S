The bootstrap protocol for Barcelona is a little different from older Opterons, 
so an older BIOS that doesn't know the new protocol won't be able to bring up 
any CPU other than the bootstrap processor.  My wild guess is that this is 
what's happening and a BIOS update will fix it, but as Arjan said, please post 
dmesg when reporting bugs like this.
