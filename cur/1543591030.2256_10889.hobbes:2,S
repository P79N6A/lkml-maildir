          Hello,
     I`m still experiencing file tail corruptions
  on subj.
     And more: after i had restored bblocked patrition
  (by relying on drive`s ability to remap bblks on
  write by wroting small modification of debugreiserfs
  which zeroified all bblks), i had _runtime_ tail
   corruptions of the mc`s dir hotlist which i tried 
   to rewrite again and again.
  i found, that "sync"ing after modifying helps to keep
  file fine, so it does until now.
