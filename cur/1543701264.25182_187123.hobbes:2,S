Hello,
I have got an HP omnibook 4150B. When booting with atyfb,
the kernel messages look great:
atyfb: 3D RAGE Mobility (PCI) [0x4c4d rev 0x64] 8M SDRAM, 29.498928 MHz XTAL, 230 MHz PLL, 50 Mhz MCLK
fb0: ATY Mach64 frame buffer device on PCI
But either the screen is black and I see only the cursor and Background
colors (CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE disabled), but X11 starts fine.
With CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE enabled it does not work at all:
I get a completely broken picture that is not syncing and blinking and so on.
Its completely useless. X11 will not work either :(
I enabled in the kernel config:
CONFIG_FB_ATY, CONFIG_FB_ATY_CT and CONFIG_FB_ATY_XL_INIT
lspci -v:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: 
    ATI Technologies Inc Rage Mobility P/M AGP 2x (rev 64) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company: Unknown device 000a
    Flags: bus master, stepping, medium devsel, latency 66, IRQ 10
    Memory at fd000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
    I/O ports at e800 [size=256]
    Memory at fedfe000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
    Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=128K]
    Capabilities: [50] AGP version 1.0
    Capabilities: [5c] Power Management version 1
According to dmesg and to the omnibook's manual the card shall have 8 MB
memory and not 16 MB as lspci is saying.
Regards, claas
