Openwall and GrSecurity solved this by having a special group that can 
see everything, just like root.  E.g. we could add a proc.gid kernel 
boot option for that purpose.

IANAL, but creating a user profile (who ran what when, used how many 
resources etc.) without the user's consent is illegal at least here in 
Germany.  As an admin I'd like to be able to prevent a user from even 
trying to spy on another user.

If with "work" you mean "show info about all users" then the patch 
becomes pointless.  The programs "work" in the sense that they do *not* 
should "cloaked" processes, which is intended. :)
OK, I understand that you need to be able to turn this feature off and I 
also don't want non-root admins to suddenly go blind.  Would adding a 
proc.gid kernel parameter and an off-switch be sufficient for you?
Thanks,
Rene
