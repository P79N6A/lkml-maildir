for TPC, most of the non-to-idle migrations are 'wrong'. So basically 
any change that gets rid of extra migrations is a win. This does not 
mean that it is all bouncing madly.

agreed, and that was my suggestion: improve the heuristics to not hurt 
workloads where there is no natural pairing.
one possible way would be to do a task_hot() check in the passive 
balancing code, and only migrate the task when it's been inactive for a 
long time: that should be the case for most TPC wakeups. (This assumes 
an accurate cache-hot estimator, for which another patch exists.)

but my patch does not do 'no form of wake balancing'. It will do 
non-load-related wake balancing if the target CPU is idle. Arguably, 
that can easily be 'never' under common workloads.
