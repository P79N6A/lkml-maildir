This may sound stupid as Linus is working for Transmeta and
I did see under menuconfig that crusoe is supported.
Question is whether I need to recompile everything (kernel and binaries)
on my current 586 platform in order to move to Crusoe?
I'm thinking about getting the new Toshiba Libretto L1 that comes with a
TM5600/600MHz cpu.
How does the TM5600/600MHz performs as compared to a P3/600MHz?
Can someone tell me how well crusoe runs linux?
Please send email to jchua@fedex.com.
Thanks,
Jeff
