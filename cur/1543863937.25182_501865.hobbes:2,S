I do understand what you're saying; there's no need to shout. I think
it's very misguided and leads to both internal inconsistency (as
demonstrated by the setup_irq() patch) and external inconsistency with
stuff like hardware documentation. But I _do_ understand what you're
saying.

Except when it isn't. Like when it's a DMA address. Or a file
descriptor. Or a CPU number. Or one of numerous other things.
But still, I do understand what you're saying although I disagree with
your intention and your statement above is plain wrong (well, at least
my misquote of it is wrong -- you actually said 'NULL' which is fair
enough, but in the middle of a rant about _zero_ so I edited the quote
to say zero because that's what we're actually talking about).

Yes, that much I understand. We disagree, but I understand you. My last
response was not intending to pursue that part of the discussion.
My question was about _how_ you think this should be achieved in this
particular case. You didn't like the suggestion that we should put your
new special-case hack into the resource code... where/how _do_ you
suggest that it's done, so that we can protect those poor driver authors
from the number zero?
