Well, to some extent I agree, but that's because it's difficult to reach such
an agreement and if we have one, new poeple come with new ideas and we need to
start all over again. :-)
In the meantime, problems are reported that need to be fixed and the fixes
often break other systems and we learn about that too late ect.
As far as the big picture is concerned, we have already agreed, or at least
this is my impression, that we need to separate the drivers' suspend callbacks
(as they exist today) from their hibernation callbacks (not present yet).
This seems to be needed for a couple of reasons, the first of them being that
the desired functionality of the hibernation code may be substantially
different from the desired functionality of the suspend code.  For instance,
it generally is not necessary to put devices into low power states, or to power
them off, in order to create the hibernation image, while it is necessary to do
that for a suspend.
It will require us to redesign the core quite a bit and I've already started to
prepare for that.  I really would like to do that in the first place and _then_
to think of improving both the suspend and hibernation code paths
_separately_.  This way, we can do things more easily and in a much more clean
way.
Greetings,
Rafael
