Actually, it's still safe upstream.  The locks are taken via a function
defined as:
unsigned long acpi_os_acquire_lock(acpi_handle handle)
{
	unsigned long flags;
	spin_lock_irqsave((spinlock_t *) handle, flags);
	return flags;
}
So a u32 flags with
  flags = acpi_os_acquire_lock(lock);
would be safe, unless a 64 bit machine stored the value of IR in the upper
word, which I don't know of any archs that do that.
