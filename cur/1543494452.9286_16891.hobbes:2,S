NT's asynchronous I/O is very useful when dealing with external hardware
and something approaching real time.  I would be most happy if Linux were 
to support asynchronous I/O and a system call like NT's WaitForMultipleObjects(). 
For those who have not done this sort of thing on NT, WaitForMultipleObjects 
is like an enhanced select() which can accept files, semaphores, mutexes, the whole 
range of things that a program might want to wait for and wakes the program 
up as soon as one of these is ready.  It allows  me to write simple code which 
deals efficiently with a long lists of asynchronous events.  
While working on device control I am glad to have NT for this capability.
Once the software works and I want to deploy it I wish I had Linux which
is worlds easier to manage, especially remote over a network connection.
Does anyone else working with Linux wish for this?
