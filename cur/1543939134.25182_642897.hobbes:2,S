I don't think that's something that would require finetuning on a
per-application basis - the kernel should tell all applications once to
reduce memory consumption and write a fat warning to the logs (which
will on well-maintained systems be mailed to the admin).
Your "and tell them how much to use" wouldn't work for most applications 
- e.g. I've worked the last weeks with a computer with 512 MB RAM and no 
Swap, which means usually only 200 MB of free RAM. I've gotten quite 
used to git aborting with "fatal: Out of memory, malloc failed" when 
200 MB weren't enough for git, and I don't think there is any reasonable 
way for git to reduce the memory usage while continuing to run.
In practice, there is a small number of programs that are both the
common memory hogs and should be able to reduce their memory consumption
by 10% or 20% without big problems when requested (e.g. Java VMs,
Firefox and databases come into my mind).
And from a performance point of view letting applications voluntarily 
free some memory is better even than starting to swap.
