Both msdos and raid are in your kernel, msdos is not a module.
Don't be misled by ksymoops reporting duplicate symbols.  It reads the
entire symbol map and reports discrepancies as it does so, mainly to
pick up idiots who feed /proc/ksyms from 2.2 and System.map from 2.4.
Don't laugh, it happens!  Unless the trace shows raid or msdos are
implicated in the oops, you can ignore the ksymoops warning.

/proc/ksyms is dynamic, it changes as modules are loaded and unloaded.
And often the oops is so bad that the machine is dead so reboot is the
only option, ksyms after reboot may be for a completely different
kernel.  If you want accurate ksyms and lsmod data to feed into
ksymoops, 'man insmod' and read section 'KSYMOOPS ASSISTANCE'.
