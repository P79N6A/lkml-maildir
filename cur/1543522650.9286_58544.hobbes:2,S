Ted, 
if you'd start by guessing a 115200 base baud. That doesn't lead to
problems if you guess wrong. Users can always adjust that later. 
Next, how about probing for another uart at address +8, addres +16,
address+32 etcetc until address +256? If you find one at address +128,
you continue probing at address+256, address+384, until you find
"nothing".
(I'm afraid that the BIOS knew what IOsize the card requested but that
this info isn't available in Linux right?)
Next, you'd ideally set the uart to "loopback mode" (i.e. that
externally this is not visible!) and send say 5 chars at 50 baud. That
should take about 1 second. If it takes around 0.25 seconds, base_baud
was wrong by a factor of 4. Adjust base_baud, and do the measurement
again.
A problem arises if you measure a base_baud of about 15MHz. Then the
chip can be powered by a 14.31 MHz crystal, 15MHz or 16MHz. 
If you measure a 115100 base_baud, then you can be confident that it
actually WAS 115200. But if you measure 14.78 MHz it is hard to round
that to either 15MHz or 14.31 which are both likely candidates.
Now haven't we detected all serial ports, and even autodetected the
base_baud? 
				Roger.
