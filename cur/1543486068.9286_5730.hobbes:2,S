Hi all,
	I'm trying to get a reasonable benchmark of apache on Linux.  
I can currently get a result of ~60 ops/second.  However, this is far
below what this class of machine be receiving.  ~600 ops/second would be a
more reasonable number, and even that is on the low end. 
The CPU is about 70% idle for most of the test.  The client receives 
"ECONNREFUSED" when it tries to connect to the box as the test is heating
up. 
This test particularly has a very large number of processes in the 
"TIME_WAIT" state. 
The server machine is a 266 Mhz PII linux box with 256Meg of memory. 
It has a FDDI network card, so network bandwidth is not a problem.  FDDI
also has the nice property of no collisions, so that also isn't an issue.
OS version: Redhat 5.2
Kernel Version: 2.2.1
Apache Version: 1.3.4
What kind of kernel tunings do I need for optimal performance? 
I have changed the values in /usr/src/linux/include/net/tcp.h to:
#define TCP_HTABLE_SIZE         2048 (was 512)
#define TCP_LHTABLE_SIZE        128 (was 32)
#define TCP_BHTABLE_SIZE        2048   (was 512)
I have changed /proc/sys/fs/inode-max to 130712 (was 8192) 
I have changed /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range to 1024  32678
(was 1024    4999)
File-nr does not appear to be a problem.  During a test, about ~400 of the 
possible 4096 file descriptors are used. 
On digital Unix, some of the tunnings used are:
     inet: ipqs=7, tcbhashnum=7, tcbhashsize=4096, tcbquicklisten=1, 
           tcp_sendspace=60000,tcp_recvspace=60000 
     net: netisrfair=1, netisrwakeupthreshold=256, netisrthreads=3
     socket: somaxconn=32767, sominconn=32767, umc=1
     proc: max-proc-per-user=1024, maxusers=1024,  max-threads-per-user=4096,
     per-proc-data-size=0x40000000000, max-per-proc-data-size=0x40000000000,
     max-per-proc-address-space=0x4000000000, 
     per-proc-address-space=0x40000000000
     vm: ubc-maxpercent=80, vm-mapentries=50000, vm-vpagemax=131072, 
     dump-user-pte-pages=1, vm-maxvas=0x40000000000
Does any one know the equivalents for linux? 
Thanks,
--Phil
