i'm not sure why you mention thread creation and freeing. The 
syslet/threadlet code reuses already created async threads, and that is 
visible all around in both the kernel-space and in the user-space 
syslet/threadlet code.
While Linux creates+destroys threads pretty damn fast (in about 10-15 
usecs - which is roughly the cost of getting a single 1-byte packet 
through a TCP socket from one process to another, on localhost), still 
we dont want to create and destroy a thread per request.
