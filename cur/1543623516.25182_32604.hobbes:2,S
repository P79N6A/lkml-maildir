However, 2.4 does not have the capability to have fs-specific init_inode_once() functions.  This probably meant altering the sb_ops structure if I wanted ext2_inode_info-specific initialization.  To make the patch less intrusive, I put i_meta_lock right into the inode structure.  I think that this is a good compromize between keeping ext2 code separated from VFS and patch simplicity.  The lock is now initialized once per inode in fs/inode.c's init_once(). 
Denied.  You can trivially do that in ext2_read_inode() and ext2_new_inode().

I was seeing a large throughput decrease when my patch was applied, and kernprof told me that a big chunk of CPU time was being spent in lockmeter's rwlock_alloc.  I have the feeling that I've hit a bottleneck in lockmeter's code spinning on locks which protect lockmeter's data structures.

Dbench throughput is not significantly affected, but that is probably a function of my puny little machine more than the effectiveness of the patch.  I'll have some results on a much more beefy 8-way PIII tomorrow.  Earlier versions of the patch reduced BKL contention during dbench by 60% on the 8-way.  CPU utilization spinning on the BKL has been as high as 40%.
ext2 patches _MUST_ get testing in 2.5 before they can go into 2.4.  At
the very least a month, preferably - two.  Until then consider them vetoed
for 2.4, no matter how BKL brigade feels about their crusade.
