In the original statement, the issue no.3 was that the /kernel/ would only
run on one CPU at a time. Which I guess is true in 2.0 with the kernel wide
spinlock. User mode code can run on the other CPUs, but generally only one
processor can be doing anything useful in kernel mode at any point in time.
Of course, a lot of this has gone away in 2.1/2.2 as I understand it.
The phrasing of the original statement is just slightly ambiguous.
