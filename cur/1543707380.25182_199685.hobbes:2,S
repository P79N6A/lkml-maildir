hi,
i just upgraded to kernel version 2.6.3 and my e1000 NIC cheesed to work.
in 2.6.2 it gave no problems.
e1000 support is compiled as module. i'm able to load module but as
soon as i do a "ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1" system freezes and i have to
hit reset button.
let me know if i need to provide more information or test any patch.
cheers
domenico
