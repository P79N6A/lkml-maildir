Subject: Dual DAC 960 Raid (Possible?)

  We bought a shiny new VA Linux 3500.  Our disk capasity needs to be expanded,
and after a nasty experience and a call to VA I realized that the DAC 960
controller is not dual channel, and cannot handle both internal and external
disks.  The driver author (and CTO of VA) says that 'in theory' I can run two
DAC 960's to handle the two arrays.  However, downtime costs about $30000 per
hour so I'm not interested in theories.  Has this been tested by anyone, and if
not, what should I do.  I'd hate to waste a perfectly good DAC 960.
Here's the config:
Dual PIII Xeon 500
512M RAM
Kernel 2.2.12 VA issue
Mylex DAC 960 Raid Card
6 internal 9.1G drives
6 external 9.1G drives (The problem)
