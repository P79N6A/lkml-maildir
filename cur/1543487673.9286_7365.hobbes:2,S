Subject: 2.2.2: bad FAT error while renaming files

Debian 2.1, Kernel 2.2.2, compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3
Was renaming a few directories.. basically had this:
arf/
arf/blah___
arf/foo bar dir___
arf/blah blah___
(etc... about 3 more dirs like this)
did 
# mmv -r "*__" "#1"
worked ok. then I noticed I missed a _, so I did
# mmv -r "*_" "#1"
which renamed two dirs succesfully then spit out this error:
Feb 26 14:34:15 charon kernel: Filesystem panic (dev 08:05).
Feb 26 14:34:15 charon kernel:   FAT error
Feb 26 14:34:15 charon kernel:   File system has been set read-only
Feb 26 14:34:15 charon kernel: Directory 164325025: bad FAT
the filesystem in question is a fat32 partition, 7832392 blocks. 
I rebooted into win and did a scandisk, which said "part of the ARF folder
is stored in an invalid location".  I chose the default solution of
truncating the invalid part, and I don't seem to have lost any data.
I did not try to replicate it, since I don't wish to tempt fate. :)
