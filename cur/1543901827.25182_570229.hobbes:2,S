Opinions differ (a bit) but personally I think the benefit of fixing the
warnings outweighs the risk that these suppressions will later hide a real
bug.
Certainly, using uninitialized_var() is better than open-coding "= 0" all
over the place.
Purists can add a config variable to centrally disable uninitialized_var()
if they want to check on the warnings.
