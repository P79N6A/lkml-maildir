   It is opaque and should be able to represent all dma (or I would prefer
   bus) addresses in the system.  The examples I've seen where people
   assume it to be 32bits in size are, well, broken.
It is the type to be used for 32-bit SAC based DMA.
DMA-mapping.txt is pretty clear about this.
In fact, because it is well documented, ia64 is in direct violation of
the API.  I've been mentioning things like this since the beginning.
