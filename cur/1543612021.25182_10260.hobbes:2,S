It works for a while then stops. select() works properly for a while, 
and then starts returning timeouts.
I've tried this with DEBUG both on and off, and also with 
DEBUG_INTERRUPTS on/off... no difference.
I don't see anything too interesting in DEBUG+DEBUG2 output. Select() 
stops working after the buffer fills up (after 4 seconds with artsd set 
to 256byte fragments*32) and doesn't start working again after the 
buffer begins to drain.
