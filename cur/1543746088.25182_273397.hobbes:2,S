You already have a saa7134-cards.c which you could turn
into a seperate module. I doubt users would care if they need
saa7134.o only or an additional module, if hotplug takes
care of loading them.

Delaying request_module() sounds ugly. Anyway, if you can
get it to work reliably...
Actually dvb-bt8xx.ko has a similar problem (no hotplug for DVB). It
uses bttv_sub_register(), though, but this doesn't do probing
and the PCI ids have to be in bttv-cards.c. It would be nicer
if dvb-bt8xx.ko could use a similar mechanism as dvb-ttpci.ko.
Or do you plan to add request_module("dvb-bt8xx") in bttv-driver.c?
And how about cx88 (I haven't checked this)?
