yes, that's why i'm asking about the version and the full backtrace.  
Threaded irq handlers run with irqs enabled:
        /*
         * Unconditionally enable interrupts for threaded
         * IRQ handlers:
         */
        if (!hardirq_count() || !(action->flags & SA_INTERRUPT))
                raw_local_irq_enable();
