This sounds like the problem I've been having.  For me it
seems to be dependant on the drive type.  I have 2 Quantum Vikings on
a sys @work on a 7890 and it works fine.  @ home, I have a SEAGATE
ST1318203LW (18G) which works fine.  But I try I/O on my 2nd or
3rd HD's which are Western Digital: WDE18310 Ultra2 and I
get the timeouts.  Inserting the 2.2.13 SCSI driver into the 2.2.14
kernel got rid of the problem.  So it seems while the SCSI
driver changes help some drives, they broke other configurations.
I have tagged command queuing off -- as that is supposed to be
the 'safe' setting.
