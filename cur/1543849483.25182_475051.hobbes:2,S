So it found PageLRU set when it should not have been.

Looks like either the isolated list of pages got messed up, or the page
flag flipped from !PageLRU when we isolated it, to PageLRU when we check
it again here.
If I'm not mistaken, page->flags should be in eax, which which may point
to the list being messed up rather than a flags bitflip.
Either way I'd say you have some memory corruption problems, whether it
is bad memory or a device/driver problem. Hard to help.
You could try running a 2.6.19-rc2 kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST and
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM turned on and see if that catches anything.

linux.kernel is the right place. Thanks.
