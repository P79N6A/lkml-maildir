Hello!
i bought a medion sim 2010 laptop, put the info i collected under
http://www.inforezo.org/~bboett/sim2010/
whichever linux distribution i try to boot stops after loading the
kernel....
none of them is able to start a working kernel....
i suppose its because of the graphiccard that shares its memory with the
proc....
is there any docu somewhere on how to boot such a thing? 
i take any hint about how to get a linux workign on that box....
please add me as CC since the list robot doesn't like me, and the
list-moderator has other things to do as to subscribe me by hand....
