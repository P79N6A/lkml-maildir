The SII has support for this in the h/w btw (see the docs). Otherwise
IDE as a protocol can get stuck if the drive enters rotating doorstop
mode at the wrong moment.

There are a couple of "yes we do LBA48" "no we don't do this command in
LBA48" cases with maxtors (Cache flush is one, the stroke stuff triggers
another)

No no - some devices have a master and a slave on them when you detect
but only one disk attached because they forgot to bother decoding it in
the adapter (eg some pcmcia with microdrives). This causes bad shit
especially with hal style automounting.

ISA IRQ lines - two controllers, one IRQ but edge triggered and not
sharable directly. The core old IDE code actually supports all of this
and people have run stuff like 6 ISA IDE controllers in a PC.[1]
