	Likely interesting readings from 1981 (and 1985) are:
	
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc801.txt
	
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/ien/ien-168.txt.1
	
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/tcp-ip-implementations.txt.1
	
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/ien/ien-137.txt.3
	( ok, I looked for a) old documents, b) containing word VAX )
	For 4.1BSD the BBN code was the thing (entry BBN-VAX-UNIX(*)),
	for 4.2BSD the Berkeley team did a lot of work, but per
	the entry BERKELEY-VAX-UNIX-4.2(*) they apparently just
	pulled in BBN code and made some small changes.
	(*) At the tcp-ip-implementations.txt.1
	So, instead of Berkeley Socket API, perhaps we should
	refer to  "BBN Socket API" ?
	Also, very likely that BBN code is the source of the
	TCP URG one-off processing error in 4.* BSD systems,
	and their derivatives ?
