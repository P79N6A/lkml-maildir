But not *initially*.
We should not confuse *debugging* with *reporting bugs*.  While the former is
actually more difficult and more time consuming than writing the code in which
the bug is present, the latter should be as simple as sending an email.

Apparently, you are expecting the reporters do *debug* problems, while they need
not be aware of how to do that.
IMHO, we should make reporting problems as simple as reasonably possible and
once we've learnt that a bug is present (call it a "bug notification" or
whatever if you think that "bug report" is not the right name), we can instruct
the reporter to provide us with more information, as needed.
For example, "my box doesn't boot with 2.6.24-rc3" is the kind of information
which should be sufficient for everyone on this list to come to the conclusion
that there _is_ a problem without any additional information. ;-)  [Of course,
the additional information will be needed to debug the problem.]

Still, it's annoying if you attach tons of information to the report and that
information does not turn out to be useful.

The choice of the tool should be a result of the choice of a *method*.  IOW,
we have to know our needs and choose the tool that satisfies them or write one
if it doesn't exist.
For now, IMHO, we don't really know what we need.
