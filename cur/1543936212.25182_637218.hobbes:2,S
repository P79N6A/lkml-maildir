A little bit of warning about these patches, they are WIP, that's why I
did not send them earlier. It regress nohz=off.
A bit of context: these patches aim at making sure cpu_clock() on my
laptop (cpufreq enabled) never overflows/underflows/warps with
CONFIG_NOHZ enabled. With these patches, I have a few hundreds
overflows and underflows during early bootup, and then nothing :-)

You are talking about "x86: scale cyc_2_nsec according to CPU
frequency" here, but I don't think it is at stakes here as David has:

Let me review my patches myself to give a bit of context:

This, I'd like to have it in .25 just for convenience.

You already know that one ;-)

This is a bugfix for .25 once the previous patch is applied. I don't
think it helps David, but it could help blktrace users with cpufreq
enabled.

I think this one is the most important for David, but unfortunately it
has some problems.

Here, I initially wrote rq->last_tick_seen + 1 but experiments showed
that +2 was needed as I really saw deltas of 2 milliseconds.
These patches have two objectives:
 - taking into account that jiffies are not always incremented by 1
thanks to nohz
 - as the tick is stopped and restarted it may not tick at the exact
expected moment, so allow a window of 1 jiffie. If the tick occurs
during the right jiffy, we know the TSC is more precise than the tick
so don't correct the clock.
And the problem is that I seem to need a window of 2 jiffies, so I need
some help.

This is one is needed too but I'm less confident in its validity.

This one is a bit ugly and seems to break nohz=off.

No, I'm not proud of this :-(
Thanks.
