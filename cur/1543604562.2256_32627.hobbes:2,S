Rock solid?  You must have better luck than I and many acquaintances with
Redhat.  We've tried out many Redhat distros just to be caught in an
avalanche of bug and other "issues".  Furthermore they appear to just love
beta or alpha software.  I still cannot believe that they used an ALPHA
version of vim 6.0 as the default system text editor.  Only guess is that it
must have been just for the extra version number since the 5.x versions have
all been more than enough for simple text editing.
