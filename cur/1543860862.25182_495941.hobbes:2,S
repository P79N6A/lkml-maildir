It seems >=2.6.19 and the SuSEfirewall are incompatible.
Turning off the firewall on the laptop cured the problem using 
2.6.20-rc2 and 2.6.20-rc3. I thought it was off. On the 64x2 box, the 
firewall is turned off, so I shall have to reconfigure the network to 
use the Gigabit ethernet instead of the eepro100 in case I turned it off 
after seeing the bug on that box, but didn't stop the firewall.
There is still the problem where the ethernet doesn't get configured 
with acpi=off which I shall post to the acpi devel list, but this is not 
a showstopper for me. ifconfig eth0 192.168.10.5 returns SIOCSIFFLAGS: 
Function not implemented.
Thanks and Regards
Sid.
