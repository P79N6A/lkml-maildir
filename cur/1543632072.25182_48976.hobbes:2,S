Still probably worth doing in the long term. In the short term, we could 
possibly have a sysctl or personality flag to disable it for the benefit of 
broken software. I'm in favour of just letting it break though, to be 
honest - it's _already_ possible to trigger the breakage in some 
circumstances and making it more reproducible is a _good_ thing.

stat() would be restartable. With -ERESTARTNOINTR would prevent us from 
ever actually returning -EINTR if the signal handler exists and returns.
I suspect open() would actually be more of a pain -- but that we could
probably also restart if we get interrupted as early as the read_inode()
stage.
You don't actually have to redesign the API, although I agree it could do 
with it. We could get rid of the bloody silly returning status _and_ length 
in one return code from read()/write() etc.
