I thought this as well :(
But I'm a bit confused: The patch in git has
+       /* only bus-device parents get a "device"-link */
+       if (dev->parent && dev->parent->bus) {
+               error = sysfs_create_link(&dev->kobj, &dev->parent->kobj,
+                                         "device");
and
-               if (parent) {
-                       sysfs_create_link(&dev->kobj, &dev->parent->kobj,
-                                                       "device");
which really look like two different things. (My original patch didn't
have the check for the parent's bus.) Don't know what happened here :(
(Simon: Do the links reappear if you change
	if (dev->parent && dev->parent->bus)
to
	if (dev->parent)
in device_add_class_symlinks()?)
