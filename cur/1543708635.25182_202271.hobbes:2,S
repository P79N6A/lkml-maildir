Exactly, that's the whole point, if you want userland accel you must disable
kernel land accel.  That's was my question against acceleration work inside
the kernel.  Nobody use it in userland and is the stability devil in fbdev.
If you want acceleration in userland there is mesa-solo or directfb or console-sdl.
In short acceleration belongs to specialized libs not the kernel.
Why accel it is needed for font drawing?, i am pretty sure my 8bit video old
sparc doesn't have any accel and is pretty capable for drawing fonts.
