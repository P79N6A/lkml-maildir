Hi,
I'm experiencing _bad_ trouble with TCP/PPP latency lately.
About half of my calls to demon.nl gives normal PPP latency
and performance (100 to 200 ms latency), but sometimes I get
a network latency of 20 to 30(!) seconds on the PPP link.
I'm using kernel 2.2.7 with the following PPP command line:
/usr/sbin/pppd lock modem /dev/modem 115200 idle 90 demand \
    defaultroute mru 296 mtu 296 bsdcomp 15,15 $LOCAL_IP:$REMOTE_IP\
    novj netmask $NETMASK connect $DIALER_SCRIPT
Before switching off Von Jacobson compression the network
latency was usually worse, but now it's all right about
50% of the time...
Running 'mtr' for some time (or ping) usually brings back
the latency to about half of what it was before, but it
still sucks eggs :(
Anybody got an idea what to do?
thanks,
