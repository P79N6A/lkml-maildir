MTRR is enabled - here's the dump from /proc/mtrr:
reg00: base=0xc0000000 (3072MB), size=1024MB: uncachable, count=1
reg01: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0x100000000 (4096MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
Note that the sizes sum to six gigabytes, and we only have four in the
box. 
We've discovered that if we turn off PCI hotplug support and resource
remapping in the BIOS, then /proc/mtrr looks more sensible:
reg00: base=0xfc000000 (4032MB), size=  64MB: uncachable, count=1
reg01: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
However, the 64G-compiled kernel still hangs. 
The complete task dump is at 
http://quirk.fnal.gov/xeon/
 
It looks like everything is blocked on lock_get_status.

Sysreq dump, plus meminfo and MTRR are at the above URL. Please let me
know if you need any other information.
FYI, with the revised BIOS settings, even the 4G-compiled kernel sees
and uses the full 4G. So if this problem turns out to take time to fix,
we can still get full use from the machine in the interim. 
Many thanks for the help!
