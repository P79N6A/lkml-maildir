No, I think something different is best.
Your first change to push the US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY code down after the test
for pusb_dev is good.. but, in the case where that pointer is bad, we need
to cook up something totally fake, like INQUIRY data that says
"DISCONNECTED" "USB-STORAGE DEVICE" or somesuch.....

It's not that hard.  No matter what the problem is, tell the customer 
to reinstall Windows.
