Indeed, please do this. (Or just make it work for non-devfs as well)

I once had a way of dealing with this, what it did was:
At the end of "make config", check a set of declared "dependency rules" and
if they are violated, just give a warning-message and run a "make
quietoldconfig" so that only the relevant questions are asked again. 
At that time, nobody was interested....  But if people are interested now, I
can dig it up....
