Only 200? :)
Yes, I agree, but the thing I see about the eth interface is that it allows much 
more remote debugging, like accrost the country, and it is every so much easier 
to set up.  I don't know about you, but my experience with rs232, which after 
all, can only be wired one of two ways, it that the probability of getting it 
wrong is about 90%.
