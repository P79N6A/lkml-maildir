I would hate to tell mission control for Mankind's first mission to another
star to reboot every 200 years because "there is no need to worry about it."
As a matter of principle an OS should never need a reboot (with exception 
for upgrading). If you say you have to reboot every 200 years, why not 
every 100? Every 50? .... Every 45 days (you know what I am referring 
to :-) ?

I think you are wrong here. The only place you need absolute time is a 
for the clock (CLOCK_REALTIME). You waste CPU using a 64 bit
representation when you could have used a 32 bit. With a 32 bit 
implementation you are forced to handle the corner cases with wrap 
around and too big arguments up front. With a 64 bit you hide those 
problems.
I think CFS would be best off using a 32 bit timer counting in micro 
seconds. That would wrap around in 72 minuttes. But as the timers are 
relative you will never be able to specify a timer larger than 36 minuttes 
in the future. But 36 minuttes is redicolously long for a scheduler and a 
simple test limiting time values to that value would not break anything.
