Hi Ingo,
thanks for the reply and sorry for the late reaction. I've been away
for a week and (unexpectedly) didn't have email/internet connectivity
during this time.

Actually I didn't remove the tick-based load-balancing, just
simplified it and wanted to have only one load_balance() call instead of
separate load_balance(), node_balance(),
load_balance_in_timer_interrupt_when_idle() and
load_balance_in_timer_interrupt_when_busy().
The current change keeps track of the number of failed load_balance
attempts and does cross-node balancing after a certain number of
failed attempts. If I understand you correctly you'd like to test this
concept also on a lower level? So keep track of the number of
schedules and context switches and call the SMP load balancer after a
certain number of schedules? This could work, though on idle CPUs I'm
more comfortable with the timer tick... The logic of cpu_idle() would
need a change, too. Do you expect an impact on the latency issue?
Would you mind doing these changes in two steps: first the simple NUMA
one, later the radical SMP change?

With the small fix for NUMA there's no problem because the
CAN_MIGRATE_TASK macro really compares times/jiffies for getting an
idea about the cache coolness. This wouldn't change even with the
elimination of the timer based load_balance calls.
