I guess that you really mean "emitted" here, not "omitted"?
More importantly, I don't agree that it's the best we can do here.
Maybe it was already discussed before and there's a good reason to not
report errors from "get" functions at the gpio-core level, but I
can't see it. Whether a read error should be considered as "0" or
"1" (or neither) should be a decision left to the user of the GPIO
chip, rather than to each GPIO driver.

Should be at least dev_warn() and maybe even dev_err().

Same thing here.

This error message could certainly be reworded to sound better. Also, for
consistency you should include the value of "ret" in the message.
