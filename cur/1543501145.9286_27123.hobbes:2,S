Hello,
I have run iozone locally on my new 18 Go hard disk to check performance.
The Linux machine is a PII 400/128 Mo/SMP/Tekram 390F.
I have quite good results with only one iozone : 17+ Mo/s writing, 15+ Mo/s
reading.
Now, I can see really bad performance with 3 iozones running :
17+ Mo/s (cumulated) writing, and 2,7 Mo/s (cumulated) reading. At the time
of reading, both CPU load is nearly null.
If I use a UP kernel (2.2.10-ac4 or 2.2.5) I have 8+ Mo/s reading, which
can be explained (I guess) due to heads movements and seek times.
So, it seems that SMP has big trouble when parrallelizing readings (maybe
a problem with SCSI, I do not know, since I have no IDE on the SMP box).
A+,
