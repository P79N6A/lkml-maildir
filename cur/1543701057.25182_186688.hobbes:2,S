Sorry for misstating that.  It's actually the other way around.  2.6.0 is
not giving me a ton of unrequested log syslog messages, but neither is it
giving any reason for the modem to stop working.  It only observes that the
modem hung up with no visible reason, and it doesn't even notice that the
modem cannot be retried until ejection and reinsertion.  In both 2.4.20 and
2.6.0, the serial_cs driver detects the UART as a TI 16750, which either
means that the UART really is a 16750 but the chip and the driver don't
agree on how the chip should be handled, or that the UART is a 16550A (or
something else) being misdetected.
SuSE's 2.4.20 PCMCIA configuration is writing around 6,000 syslog messages
every time I boot it.  I don't think you want that, especially when it's
from 2.4.20 which is obeying my addition in file /etc/pcmcia/serial.opts
saying  SERIAL_OPTS="uart 16550A"
