Stephen and Neil Brown recently worked this out.  It's a
rare situation which only affects data=journal mode.
Fix problem in data=journal mode where writeback could be left pending on a 
journaled, deleted disk block.  If that block then gets reallocated, we can 
end up with an alias in which the old data can be written back to disk over
the new.  Thanks to Neil Brown for spotting this and coming up with the
initial fix.
