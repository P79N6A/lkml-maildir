Hi,
I'm against "signed shift right", because the reason for the macro is exaclty that 
CPUs do a "signed" shift right. John does a "signum(arg) * right_shift(abs(arg), 
number_of_positions)". So maybe it's the signed_unsigned_shift_right(), susr() to 
be cryptic ;-)
I'm only surprised that there are many places where such a routine is needed, and 
still it's missing in sime bitops.h #include.
Regards,
Ulrich
