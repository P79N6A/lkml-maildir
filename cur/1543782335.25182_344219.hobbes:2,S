No, its because guys like you snip out content
when they reply, and/or only read the parts of
messages that you want to read, so when other
people enter a thread, they miss the questions
that were asked long ago. Quoting my post on Aug
22:
"All of this aside, I need to measure the raw 
capabilities of the kernel. With 'bsd OSes I can 
tell what the breaking point is by driving the 
machine to livelock. Linux seems to have a soft, 
floating capacity in that it will drop packets 
here and there for no isolatable reason. I'm 
having difficulty making a case for its use in a 
networking appliance, as dropped packets are not 
acceptable. How do I tune the "its ok to drop 
packets when x occurs" algorithm to be "its never
ok to drop packets unless x occurs" (such as a 
queue depth)? Is it possible?"
