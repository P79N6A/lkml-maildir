First, I'll NAK this and all AIO patches until the patch description
says that it's been run through the regression tests that we've started
collecting in autotest.  They're trivial to run, never fear:
 cd /usr/local
 svn checkout svn://test.kernel.org/autotest/trunk/client autotest
 cd autotest
 bin/autotest tests/aio_dio_bugs/control
(We'll be moving this to LTP soon, I think, but that will just change
the commands to cut and paste.)

I have mixed feelings.  I think the userspace getevents support was
poorly designed and the simple fact that we've gone this long without it
says just how desperately the feature isn't needed.
At the same time, it's a small change and the code is already there.  So
it's hard to get too worked up about it.  We can always remove support
in the future by never changing the indexes if we require that apps fall
back to sys_io_getevents().
In any case, let's see a test which exercises userspace event collection
before we claim to support it.  I'd prefer a little stand-alone C app
like the ones in autotest for simple unit testing.  A fio patch to
stress test it would probably also be well received.

Please quantify the improvement.  We're allocating more ring elements
than userspace asked for and than were accounted for in aio_max_nr.
That cost, however teeny, will be measured against the benefit.

Is that buggy?  How will the code tell if head == tail means a full ring
or an empty ring?  The old code added that extra event to let it tell
the ring was full before head == tail and it would think it's empty
again, I think.  I'm guessing roundup(nr_events + 1) is needed.

(info) is now evaluated twice.  __info = (info), please, just like
__event there.

The ring page, which is mmaped to userspace at some weird address, was
just written through a kmap.  Do we need a flush_dcache_page()?  This
isn't this patch's problem, but it'd need to be addressed if we're using
the ring from userspace.

Try to minimize gratuitous reformatting, please.
