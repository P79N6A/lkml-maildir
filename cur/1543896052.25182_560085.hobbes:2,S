To be honest I wish some of the people continually stealing our work
would just go off and use BSD instead since the BSD people welcome that
kind of binary only one way usage.
The license is/was a problem however because of the advertising clause
parts. It was one reason BSD was not used on a large companies choice of
routers - the 'credit required' bit at the time gave the lawyers
heartburn.
