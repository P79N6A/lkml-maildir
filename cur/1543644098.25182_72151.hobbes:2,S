There are two slightly different things happening, I think.
1. When you say hdc=ide-scsi, you are telling the IDE system that you don't 
want to use the normal IDE interfaces to userland (such as ide-cdrom), but 
instead want all access to this device to be accessed through the SCSI 
midlayer (and associated SCSI interfaces, like the sg and scd drivers). So 
ide-scsi becomes the driver, instead of ide-cdrom. You should be able to see 
this in /proc/ide/hdc/driver
2. ide-scsi is greedy, and will grab any IDE device without a driver. ATAPI 
floppy devices (hopefully) like your zip drive need the IDE floppy device 
driver, which is probably not loaded. What does CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEFLOPPY 
equal in your kernel config?

And you will, with the right driver loaded :-)

If you load ide-floppy before ide-scsi, and it still doesn't work, then there 
is a bug.
