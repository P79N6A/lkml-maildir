Others are reporting machines which fail int he memory allcoator much
earlier, and which claim to have four CPUs and 16 nodes.  So something is
very wonky in the rc3-mm1 page allocator.
I guess suspicion has to be directed at the memoryless-nodes patches, but
until that's cleared up I don't think there's much to be gained from
chasing this iommu problem, now that you've worked out that it's a bogus
memory allocation failure (thanks).
