It'll be released when it is ready, not according to a fixed
schedule... and yes, within one week looks unlikely.

I'd say no.
2.6.17-rc3 is a development kernel, no guarantees about anything really.
If you want a newer kernel stable kernel, then your safest bet would
be the latest -stable one, currently that would be 2.6.16.15

Development kernels are run completely at your own risk. It may run
fine, it may explode at boot, it may cause slow silent corruption, it
may eat your lunch, it may cause an alien invasion - all bets are
off... (although it actually seems to be getting pretty good, I've
been running 2.6.17-rc3-git12 without problems for a while).
