Now, if they were functionally equivalent, such a comparison
would be less of an apples/oranges thing!
The most useful comparison would focus on technical aspects of
the gpio_chip abstraction itself (i.e. $SUBJECT).

I thought it was more important to address the $SUBJECT first:
get a working gpio_chip abstraction which covers all the needed
functionality.  The patch had a hook for implementing such tweaks,
but it wasn't used.
The next version you'll see lets the platform code use its own
existing lookup code, as part of slimming things down a bit.
I also decided to take out the debugfs support.

I most certainly did not speak about "whatever GPIO API they like"!!
Quite the contrary, in fact.  Please don't put words in my mouth.
(You've been doing it quite extensively in this thread; it's rude.)
And that "core" patch I posted was clearly usable "right away";
otherwise the two examples _using_ it couldn't have worked.

When I get tired of repeating myself, just remember:  the current
programming interface *DOES* allow such extensibility.  That's what it
means to be an "interface", rather than an implementation:  it defines
inputs and outputs, allowing any process that conforms to both.
In fact, the patches I sent demonstrated exactly that extensibility.
Same interface, additional chips; different implementation inside.

I can make it comparable to existing implementations that work
the same way ... e.g. AT91 and OMAP code.  Of course, it's not
possible to get away from the cost of function indirection, with
a generic gpio_chip abstraction.  Or those lookup costs; but as
you agreed, those costs don't seem to matter much.  And if they
ever do matter, caching support would be easy to add.

I think having an optional gpio_chip, not unlike what was in
that one patch, should be reasonable; also, making it work on
some platforms that I use.  But I don't think there's much
overlap between those platforms and what hh.org uses.
