Not really. The soft error count is preserved across the 'correct' kinds
of open/close operations. To use `mt` to get the count and, to preserve
the state of the tape machine, you need to do your open/close against
the minor number that has the high-bit set:
# file /dev/st*
st0:    character special (9/0)
st1:    character special (9/1)
st3:    character special (9/128)
Instead of using /dev/st0, you would use (on this machine) /dev/st3.
So, if you do your I/O and status through /dev/st3, you will get
meaningful information. Once you close /dev/st0, all history is
lost (correctly). Note that if you do I/O through /dev/st3, the
tape will not automatically rewind on close. You will need to
use `mt` for that.
Cheers,
