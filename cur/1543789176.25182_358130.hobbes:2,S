Subject: [patch 2.6.14-rc4] i386: spinlock optimization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Attempt to acquire spinlock sooner after spinning and then noticing
it has become available.  Also adds a slight delay before testing the
spinlock again when it's not available, reducing bus traffic.
This change makes spinlocks fairer in the case where the owner drops
the lock and then immediately tries to take it again.
