The underlying filesystem format can make things easier on you...  and 
given that compressing inevitably requires some amount of data copying, 
it's not terribly difficult.  I wouldn't claim NTFS is anything close to 
well-designed, but supporting compression under Linux on NTFS is at 
least feasible and shouldn't require tons of thought.  (I've looked at 
it when dicking around with NTFS-TNG)
