I had the name "zero_page" in V1 and V2 of the patch where it was
separate. Then someone complained about code duplication.

clear_page is called clear_page because it clears one page of *any* order
not just higher orders. zero-order pages are not segregated nor are they
intrisincally better just because they contain more memory ;-).
