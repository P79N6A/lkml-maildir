In theory yes, but it would have much more overhead. Also I think prefetching
algorithms like this really belong in the kernel.

No in fact the permission problem is much harder to fix in user space.
The shared libraries would need some user support. Basically just a way
how the ld.so can tell the kernel about the offsets/locations of new 
bitmaps to add to the pbitmap list
