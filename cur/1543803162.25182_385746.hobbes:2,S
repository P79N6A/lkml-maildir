The basic problem is that it overrides any other dependencies and it makes 
easy to screw them up.
The basic rule should be to use select only to include library 
functionality, which is mostly independent and has no other dependencies.
Selecting larger subsystem, which may require more configuration itself, 
should be avoided.
