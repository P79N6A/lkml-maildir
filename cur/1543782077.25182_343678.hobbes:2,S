Did you know that you could cut your food right down to 1000 calories and still gain weight? Eat 1000, burn only 800 and you will gain weight- eventhough you're constantly hungry.
On the other hand, you could eat say 3,000 calories and loose a lot of weight- If you burn 3,500 
which has less to do with excersise and mostly has to do with your metabolism.
Boost your metabilism effectively with MetaGen and loose those unwanted pounds
Do some moderate exersize while taking it and loose even more pounds naturally and repidly.
