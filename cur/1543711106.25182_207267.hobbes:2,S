For some reason it never list the VESA modes with vga=ask. I just go by 
the does in Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt to set my mode. Let me look...
I need to add more info to the docs on what modes are supported. 
	1600x1200		
	---------
256	0x119	  0x145	
32K	0x11D	  0x146
64K	0x11E
16M		  0x14E
For lilo translate them to decimal number. I'm curious if the 14X numbers 
work.

That a bug I have to work. I have a newer driver but I need to run more
