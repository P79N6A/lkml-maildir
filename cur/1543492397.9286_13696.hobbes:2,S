Dear Colleagues
At this time, my question are about kernel stack.
1- Where is the kernel stack ??
Is it above the address "0xC0000000" in the kernel memory ??
2- Which is the size of the kernel stack ??
3- Is there some system call that inform the kernel stack free size ??
I mentioned that my subject was kernel stack but I remembered another question now. So...it follows...
Suppose that I added a field in the struct task_struct (process table). I would like to know if:
4- Is there some system call that initialize that field ??
Thank you again.
Best regards,
Livia Catarina.
