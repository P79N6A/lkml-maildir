If XFS is so good (i do not doubt it), I see some issues (plz correct me
if I'm wrong...):
- XFS needs substantial changes in the VFS layer to work
- This changes are good (or make xfs so good)
- *THE THING* to do is to integrate this changes in mainline tree VFS,
  so XFS will stop duplicating half the kernel code.
Why those features are not merged ? Incompatibilities ? Licensing ?
Religious wars about some way of doing things ?
Plz, if SGI splits XFS in small chunks and starts feeding linus with
changes in the VFS, what will happen ? Why that doesn't happen ?
Just some ideas...
