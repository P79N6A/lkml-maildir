That's because my previous patch would set the poll mask and return on 
the first call in because there was space already available.  However, 
the initial call into poll() at the vfs layer evidently sets the state 
of the process to interruptible sleep, and then poll_wait() sets it back 
to running.  So, when I skipped the call to poll_wait(), I wasn't 
manually setting the task state back to running, and as a result the 
code would return, but the calling program (artsd) would be set to a 
sleeping state in the scheduler and would never get woken back up.  An 
alternative fix would have been to set the task state to running before 
leaving the poll function manually instead of relying upon poll_wait() 
to do it for us.
