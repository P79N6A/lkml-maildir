the nocheck variant is the counting semaphore in essence. I removed the
counting semaphore implementation because it caused more problems than
it solved - but it can be reintroduced later.

yeah, these are cases where the code is better off using completions
anyway. Thomas Gleixner had a good bunch of patches to convers such
semaphore use to completions - the most necessary ones are in -RT, and i
hope he'll submit the whole bunch upstream after 2.6.11 is out :-)
