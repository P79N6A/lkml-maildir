Dave, that's just not the point, the application would have to offer TWO
interfaces, one for Linux, and one for the legacy API. The legacy API is
trivial and can be viewed in the kernel or in the application.
When the legacy API can fulfill the need with, after all, two or three
lines of code added, then there is no need to add two hundred of them to
the application.
Anyways, Alexey said the patch was correct, so it has been submitted to
Alan, Linus and Wietse, no matter what. The administrator or the
distributor can always choose to add the patch no matter what you say or
think. Show a bug in the patch, show an incompatibility cause, or remain
quiet. Please.
