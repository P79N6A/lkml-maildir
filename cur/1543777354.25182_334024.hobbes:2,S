Subject: [RFC][PATCH] master abort on scanning fixes [6/9]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/14/33

The PCI bridge driver now checks if changing bridge_ctrl is necessary.
It also restores the original bridge_ctl settings when finished scanning
for devices.  Finally, a pci_bus setup fix is included.
