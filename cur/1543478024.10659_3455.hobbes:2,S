when I was working hardware repair a few years ago the shop I was in had
5-10 machines a month (within the first year warranty) that would show up
with the complaint "keyboard/mouse will not work). The usual fix was to
replace the fuse for the keyboard (soldered onto the MLB). hot plugging
your keyboard/mouse can cost you!

administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
