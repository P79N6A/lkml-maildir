 I agree. While there is no need to insist that everything be added to 
the kernel, providing the services "thru" the kernel makes things very 
compatible and transparent.  
 If we were to design a distributed programming system for some other 
OS, then maybe things would be different. However, we are talking about 
Linux here, and DIPC integrates very nicely with the rest of the system 
without adding much code to the kernel.
