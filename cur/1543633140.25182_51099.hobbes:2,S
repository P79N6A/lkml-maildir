Good catches, just a few comments on the patch.

===== drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c 1.13 vs edited =====
-		/* Make sure we have something that is valid for DMA purposes */
-		scsi_result = ((!shpnt->unchecked_isa_dma)
-			       ? &scsi_result0[0] : kmalloc(512, GFP_DMA));
+		scsi_result = kmalloc(512, GFP_DMA);
I don't think you should always use GFP_DMA here... probably better to
do:
		scsi_result = kmalloc(512,
                                      shpnt->unchecked_isa_dma ? GFP_DMA : GFP_ATOMIC);
And similarly this:
===== drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c 1.13 vs edited =====
+	unsigned char *buffer = kmalloc(512, GFP_DMA);
should probably use GFP_KERNEL (or possibly a check of
unchecked_isa_dma as above, though this doesn't seem to be needed
based on the existing code).
Best,
  Roland
