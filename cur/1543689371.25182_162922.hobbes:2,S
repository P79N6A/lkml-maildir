Of course if some bozo had stuck this:
	extern unsigned long calibrate_tsc(void);
in a header file rather than in a .c file (timer_cyclone.c), this problem
would not have occurred.  Nevereverever put extern declarations in .c files!

Can we not we avoid the cut-n-paste coding?
There is also timer_tsc.c:calibrate_tsc_hpet() which is almost the same as
timer_hpet.c:calibrate_tsc().  Seem to me that we could tweak
calibrate_tsc_hpet() a bit, unstaticalise timer_tsc.c:calibrate_tsc() and
have two functions rather than four?

Hum.  Please do this:
mnm:/usr/src/25> nm -n vmlinux|grep -3 wait_timer_tick
c043b360 D using_apic_timer
c043b380 d lapic_sysclass
c043b3e0 d device_lapic
c043b41c D wait_timer_tick
c043b420 D nmi_watchdog
c043b424 d nmi_hz
c043b440 d nmi_sysclass
It could be an overrun accessing device_lapic.  There's a patch in -mm
which plays around with kobject.name although I can't immediately see why
it would cause this to happen.  If the problem ocurs in -mm and not in
-linus then we need to be looking suspiciously at
	kobject-unlimited-name-lengths.patch
and
	kobject-unlimited-name-lengths-use-after-free-fix.patch
