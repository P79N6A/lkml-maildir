The traditional Unix way might be for user process to
call one of the blocking functions (read(), poll(), sigwait(), etc),
and have the kernel unblock the process in the usual way.
There is support for real async I/O on the horizon; see the SGI patch
at 
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/
 if you need async I/O today.
Not sure this is what you're after, though.
Can you provide an example of how you want to use this?

Even AS/400 is getting into this stuff; see
