Hi Stefan.  Thanks for your patch.  It worked great.  Now I see this
in the logs:
ohci1394: fw-host0: SelfID received outside of bus reset sequence
IEEE 1394 device has ROM CRC error
IEEE 1394 device has ROM CRC error
Program usplash tried to access /dev/mem between 0->8000000.
ieee1394: Node added: ID:BUS[0-00:1023]  GUID[00d0f54000000173]
ieee1394: Host added: ID:BUS[0-01:1023]  GUID[00e018000027d06c]
IEEE 1394 device has ROM CRC error
IEEE 1394 device has ROM CRC error
IEEE 1394 device has ROM CRC error
IEEE 1394 device has ROM CRC error
IEEE 1394 device has ROM CRC error
Also, "cat /sys/bus/ieee1394/drivers/raw1394/device_ids" no longer
causes an error.
Is it necessary for the code to spit out so many CRC errors for the
OrangeMicro iBot?  Also, are these errors indicating a significant
problem with the iBot?
Cheers,
