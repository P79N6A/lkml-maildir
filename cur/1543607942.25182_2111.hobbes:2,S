Perfect, it works, in some weeks my hair will be back!

I forgot to write about the problems when trying to install Redhat 7.1
and Redhat 7.2 with the CF present, then the real IDE disk/dev/hdb was
never found.
Passing the parameter  (hdb=flash) to the distribution kernel at
install solved this too.
