I would not take those sections as gospel, they're really an example 
only. It's quite possible that Windows does not follow that ordering.
Also, as was pointed out, pre-Vista versions of Windows follow ACPI 1.0 
and Vista follows 3.0, so 2.0 doesn't really matter since BIOS people 
won't test against it. 1.0 specifies that _PTS is to be called before 
suspending devices and 3.0 says that the AML must not depend on any 
specific device power state, so in both cases it should be safe to call 
_PTS before suspending, no?
