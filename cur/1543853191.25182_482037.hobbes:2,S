Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Make the TSC safe to be used by gettimeofday().

I've had a proof-of-concept for this since August, and finally got around to
somewhat cleaning it up.
It can certainly still be improved, namely by using vgetcpu() instead of CPUID
to find the cpu number (but I couldn't get it to work, when I tried).
Another possible improvement would be to use RDTSCP when available.
There's also a small race in do_gettimeofday(), vgettimeofday() and
vmonotonic_clock() but I've never seen it happen.
Suggestions are welcome.
