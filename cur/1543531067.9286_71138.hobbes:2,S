Hi !
As far as I understand and grepped in sources c++ is
never used in the kernel. And I found in the FAQ that
kernel is not programmed in c++.
Question:
Is there any hint to get c++ sources running in kernel
or kernel modules ?
In my tests I wasn't even able to insmod a simple module
without c++ source, just with g++ compiled ( source.cc ).
rgds,
Ralf
