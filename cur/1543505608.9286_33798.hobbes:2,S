Hi Alan,
I'm a little bit excited because I got a first rough cut of
the code working. It consists of basically 3 programs:
fiximage: this one actually manipulates the ELF image file
symaddr : resolves a list of symbol name sto their address
catdep  : converts a dependency description of the form
          "a b: c d" (symbol a and b depend on c and d) 
          into input suitable for tsort.
Additional, there is a small test program, that places a number 
of functions into the .ctors section.
To test it:
1) compile all 4 programs (fiximage needs libelf).
2) create a symbol file for the demo image (i.e. nm ./demo | grep foo. > demo.sym)
3) specify a dpendency for foo1..foo7, for instance
foo1: foo3 foo4
foo4: foo2
foo2: foo5
4) to test catdep do:
pommnitz ~/fiximage>./catdep dependencies | tsort
foo1
foo4
foo3
foo2
foo5
5) to test symaddr, add another stage to the pipe:
pommnitz ~/fiximage>./catdep inp | tsort | ./symaddr -f demo.sym
0x80483d0
0x8048460
0x8048430
0x8048400
0x8048490
6) to test fiximage, you have to do a before/after comparison:
pommnitz ~/fiximage>objdump --section=.ctors --full-contents demo
demo:     file format elf32-i386
Contents of section .ctors:
 80495b8 ffffffff d0830408 00840408 30840408  ............0...
 80495c8 60840408 90840408 c0840408 f0840408  `...............
 80495d8 00000000                             ....
pommnitz ~/fiximage>./catdep dependencies | tsort | ./symaddr -f demo.sym | ./fiximage -f demo -s .ctors
pommnitz ~/fiximage>objdump --section=.ctors --full-contents demo
demo:     file format elf32-i386
Contents of section .ctors:
 80495b8 d0830408 60840408 30840408 00840408  ....`...0.......
 80495c8 90840408 ffffffff c0840408 f0840408  ................
 80495d8 00000000                             ....
The resulting binary still does run. However, it seems that the
.ctors section for user binaries is not just a table listing all
the constructors but uses 0xffffffff and 0x00000000 to mark the
start and the end of the table. fiximage does works around this
with a disgusting hack. Oh, and it seems that the C runtime
walks the .ctors table in the wrong direction...
