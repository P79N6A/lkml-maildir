Wonderful. So you are going to accept the situation when renaming one of
the links makes another disappear?

May I ask you, what for? What should happen if I'm saying
rm /mnt/shitfs/*; cp foo.bar.baz /mnt/shitfs/;cp /mnt/shitfs/* /tmp
- should it copy the sucker twice, or what? What should happen if I cp
from one directory to another on VFAT filesystem? Making cp or sh aware of
*FAT is not an option, indeed.

And what should happen after mv foo ANTIDI~1.LST? If you consider the
whole thing as hardlinks you should end up with (a) Anti.... with the same
contents as it used to have and (b) foo being renamed. Great, now we have
to generate a new short name. Undead files, anyone? Should we change this
behaviour if there is a file called .garlic?
