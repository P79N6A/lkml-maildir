You need error correcting codes at the media level.  A molecular storage 
system like this would probably look a lot more like flash or dram than it 
would magnetic media.  (For one thing, I/O bandwidth and seek times become a 
serious bottleneck with high density single point of access systems.)

But who said the filesystem was the right level to do this at?
