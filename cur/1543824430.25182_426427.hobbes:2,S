This is a repost of the I/OAT patches, the only changes from last time
are refreshing the patches and removing an unused macro that was causing
the vger spam filters to drop patch 2/9.
This patch series is the a full release of the Intel(R) I/O
Acceleration Technology (I/OAT) for Linux.  It includes an in kernel API
for offloading memory copies to hardware, a driver for the I/OAT DMA memcpy
engine, and changes to the TCP stack to offload copies of received
networking data to application space.
These changes apply to Linus' tree as of commit
	387e2b0439026aa738a9edca15a57e5c0bcb4dfc
	[BRIDGE]: need to ref count the LLC sap
They are available to pull from
	git://63.64.152.142/~cleech/linux-2.6 ioat-2.6.18
There are 9 patches in the series:
	1) The memcpy offload APIs and class code
	2) The Intel I/OAT DMA driver (ioatdma)
	3) Core networking code to setup networking as a DMA memcpy client
	4) Utility functions for sk_buff to iovec offloaded copy
	5) Structure changes needed for TCP receive offload
	6) Rename cleanup_rbuf to tcp_cleanup_rbuf
	7) Make sk_eat_skb aware of early copied packets
	8) Add a sysctl to tune the minimum offloaded I/O size for TCP
	9) The main TCP receive offload changes
