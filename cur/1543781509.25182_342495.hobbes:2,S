Hi Kevin,
Thanks for your quick response. Here are my answers posted to the group:
> The 2.6.11 tree is a kernel.org tree?
Yes. I downloaded it from www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6
> Are you using LVM or regular partitions?
Regular.
> Do you see the scsi driver find the disks?
Nope, that's the problem. I don't see messages such as:
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.2.36
        <Adaptec aic7899 Ultra160 SCSI adapter>
        aic7899: Ultra160 Wide Channel A, SCSI Id=7, 32/253 SCBs
nor
Vendor: QUANTUM   Model: ATLAS10K2-TY184L  Rev: DA40
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 03

Tried that but it didn't help. It's just not finding the disks.
Moreover, this works fine for 2.6.11.

Yep, they're there and I see them loading fine. But, no HBAs/disks are
being found.
It's puzzling & annoying. What has changed from 2.6.11 to 2.6.12.3 with
regards to having scsi_mod, sd_mod and aic7xxx drivers as modules???
