I am trying to re-construct Viro's thoughts.  I think the steps outlined
above; though not accurate, are still insightful.
The idea is -- there is one master namespace, which has
under /share, a replica of the mount tree of namespaces belonging to all
users. 
for example if there are two users A and B, then in the master namespace
under /share you will find /share/A and /share/B, each reflecting the
mount tree for the namespaces belonging to user-A and user-B
respectively. 
Note: /share is a shared mount-tree, which means it can propagate mount
events.
Everytime the user logs on the machine, a new namespace is created which
is the clone of the master namespace. In this new namespace,
the /share/$user is made the root of the namespace. Also if other
users have allowed part of their namespace available to this user,
than those mounts are also brought under this namespace. And finally the
entire tree under /share is unmounted.
Note, though multiple namespaces can exist simultaneously for the same
user, the user is provided the illusion of per-process-namespace since
all the namespaces look identical.  
I am trying to rewrite the steps outlined above, which may or may not
reflect Viro's thoughts, but certainly reflect my reconstruction of
viro's thoughts.
1. clone the master namespace.
2. in the new namespace
	move the tree under /share/$me to /
        for each ($user, $what, $how) {
            move /share/$user/$what to /$what
	    if ($how == slave) {
                 make the mount tree under /$what as slave
            }
        }
        
3. in the new namespace make the tree under 
       /share as private and unmount /share
