This is wrong.
We have to disable preemption prior to reading smp_processor_id(). 
Otherwise we may lock/unlock the wrong processor's brlock.  The above as
you changed it is equivalent to:
	cpu = smp_processor_id();
	/* do not want to preempt here, but we can! */
	preempt_disable();
	_raw_read_lock(&__brlock_array[cpu][idx]);
And what we had, and what we need, is:
	preempt_disable();
	cpu = smp_processor_id();
	_raw_read_lock(&__brlock_array[cpu][idx]);
In other words, we need to ensure preemption is disabled prior to
calling smp_processor_id().
We also do something similar with the write patch in lib/brlock.c, but
for different reason: to disable preemption once and not NR_CPUS times.
The rest of the patch looks fine. :)
