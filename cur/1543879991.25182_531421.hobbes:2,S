So what would be the arguments why this behavior makes sense, other than 
legacy?
For /proc/mounts, one could argue that the admin might want to see everything, 
but then that's not actually true even today because /proc/mounts doesn't 
show lazyily unmounted stuff or mounts from other namespaces, so that 
everything is quite relative.
Along that line of argumentation, I would at least expect unambiguous output, 
to be able to tell which mountpoints are actually meaningful to the 
requesting process. It's not only human operators looking at /proc/mounts; 
applications care as well.
But after thinking about this issue quite a while, I really can't see what 
that should be good for. The current /proc/mounts interface is obviously 
broken; the chroot example should have demonstrated that. There are also 
unnecessary special cases because of that, such as having to filter out the 
rootfs entry when trying to figure out what's really mounted on /, and having 
to guess what's there and what's not in a particular context. The more 
complex mount scenarios will get, the more obviously broken the 
current /proc/mounts interface will become.
The getcwd() case is even stronger as the "see everything" argument makes even 
less sense there. I really can't see why the kernel should return processes 
fake pathnames. The process is explicitly asking for the current pathname to 
the working directory, it doesn't want to know what the pathname was at some 
previous point in time.

Actually, no. We could live fine with leaving getcwd() and /proc/mounts as 
ambiguous / weird / broken as they are right now. All it would take would be 
to reambiguate the result of the unambiguous __d_path(), which is really 
easy. Everything that cares about real pathnames would use the unambiguous 
version while the legacy interfaces would use the ambiguous version. But that 
really wouldn't make sense.

Why?
Thanks,
