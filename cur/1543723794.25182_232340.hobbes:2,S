  I'm getting this while building for ppc32:
    Inconsistent kallsyms data, try setting CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS
  This didn't happen with -mm5.
  The help text for CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS says I should report a
bug, and reads like kallsyms is a utility or part of the toolchain;
I think it's talking about the kernel feature though, so I guess
I'll report it here.  I'll keep this tree around in case any more
information is needed.
  While I'm asking, should I CC Paul Mackerras and/or BenH when reporting build
problems on my Powermac in the -mm tree?
