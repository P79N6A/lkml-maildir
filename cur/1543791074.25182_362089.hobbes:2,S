Yes, we have actually sold some...
    > Are any native IB/SRP native storage devices available?
I don't know what the release status of the various products are, but
Data Direct, Engenio and Mellanox have all talked about native IB/SRP
targets, and judging by John Kingman's activity, it's a safe bet that
StorageGear has something cooking as well.

Nope, I bumped it to 0.2 and put it in the modinfo.

It's definitely an initiator, so I changed that.

Fixed.

I don't think this sort of change will work.  IS_ERR() is only true if
the pointer (as an unsigned long) is in the range -1000L ... -1L.  But
PTR_ERR() will be true if the pointer is non-NULL.

I fixed the easy ones...

Nope, no spec.  I added a comment talking about this issue.

Yes, a few lines earlier:
	/*
	 * Now get a new local CM ID so that we avoid confusing the
	 * target in case things are really fouled up.
	 */

I don't think so.  No entries can be added to the CQ while we're in
that loop -- I just want to go through the CQ and throw away any of
the entries that are there.  So it's not busy-waiting -- it's just
iterating through the queue until it drains it.
Thanks,
