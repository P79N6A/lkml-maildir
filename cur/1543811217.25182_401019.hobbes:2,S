Well, be it this or that way. I don't see how a binary blob is
able to prevent that the user operates the device on illegal
freqs. In fact, it is a void protection and is just inconvenient.
An open source regdomain implementation is just as safe against
modifications, as this binary blob. There is no point in doing this
binary.
In fact, if you really want to prevent people from doing
Something Bad (tm), you must take technologies such as Trusted Computing.
And even that can, by the opinion of many people, circumvented somehow.
The best way to prevent, that a device is driven on illegal freqs,
is by not selling the device.
