The alsa patches I had available were simply a backport of 0.90rc2 from 2.5.
Since alsa is now up to 0.90rc7 they were getting old, and a new backport 
would require some effort. There isn't much point to doing this since the 
only real benefit to patching it into the kernel directly is having the 
ability to compile it into the kernel instead of as modules. You can easily 
enough compile the modules after the kernel is compiled.
