No, I meant Red Hat's kernel 2.4.20-54. It's based on 2.4.21-pre4  
with patches from Alan Cox, Arjan van den Ven and several  
other people from RedHat.

OK, I have downloaded procps 3.1.6 and have retested this on  
both 2.4.20-2.54 (2.4), 2.5.63 (stock) and 2.5.63-mm1. I have attached  
to this message "top -d1 -b" and "vmstat 1" command outputs, 
compressed with bzip2 to shorten the message length. I hope they 
will help in clarifying things a little. Both command were started up a 
while before clicking "Reply" and a few seconds after the message 
window opened up, just to let the system stabilize.

A little bit more about my scenario: I'm running Red Hat Phoebe Beta 3  
(what will in fact turn 8.1) with glibc-2.3.1, Evolution 1.2.2, XFree86 4.3.0 
and KDE 3.1. I think Evolution has been compiled against glibc-2.3.1 and 
so it will be using NPTL. As for XFree86 and KDE, I compiled them myself 
and I'm sure they are using glibc-2.3.1 and NPTL. 
  
Please, dont' hesitate in contacting me for further investigations. 
Thanks!
