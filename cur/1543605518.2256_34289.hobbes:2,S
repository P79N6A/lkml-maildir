OK, I think the problem is that the system allocates so much
highmem pages for the ramdisk that it's become impossible for
kswapd to ever meet the free target.
I _think_ this has been fixed in a more recent -ac kernel,
but haven't tested it with such a huge ramdisk...
If it is possible, could you test 2.4.12-ac3 ?
(if it's still broken, I'll go fix it)

Rik
