Actually, I was quite happy calling schedule_timeout in the flash drivers 
without changing current->state. I'm waiting to something to happen, and 
just to be considerate, I'm asking to be put to sleep for the 'expected' 
amount of time for whatever's happening. If there's other stuff on the run 
queue, it won't return immediately, will it? If there isn't other stuff on 
the run queue, I'll just busy wait till the flash chip's finished.
Otherwise, it would be TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE.
