All good stuff, but I occasionally have problems seeing the video display 
as an input device :)  It sometimes turns into an adventure syncing with 
the latest bk archive and wondering what I need to do to get console and 
keyboard.
This is in addition to not getting bootup messages past the Uncompressing 
Linux message.  The extreme weirdness is that when this happens, something 
happens to the ext3 journal and I get a boot failure next reboot.
