I second this. A module can declare, what it provides (e.g. ethX,
scsi-host-adapter), but what is loaded for each actual device
should be decided be be user space (/sbin/hotplug?).
Identification, enumeration and classification is fine in the
kernel, but assigning actual devices to each driver 
(e.g. host-adapter-A to a request_module("scsi-host-adapter"))
should be done by user space, where important.
