Not without having a really good thread library first or at least
optimizing the aio library.  The way I wrote it is *not* for optimized
performance, but instead for standard compliance.  I will sometime
soon write an optimized version of the library and before this
happened it's kind of pointless to compare the methods for the purpose
of making long-term decisions.
