Sigh.  Daniel, in my earlier emails I asked a number of questions regarding
whether existing facilities, queued patches or further slight kernel
changes could provide a sufficient solution to these problems.  The answer
may well be "no".  But diligence requires that we be able to prove that,
and handwaving doesn't provide that proof, does it?
