    That means a pointer dereference and a potential cache miss every time.
I think you'll find that the pointer code is faster than the current code.
Each time the pointer is dereferenced is to get something we want.
For example, where the code today has
	blksize_size[MAJOR(dev)][MINOR(dev)]
the new code has
	dev->blksize
Much faster, much more elegant.
