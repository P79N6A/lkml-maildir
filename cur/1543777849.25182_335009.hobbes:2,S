The ports are not getting completely disabled. The wording is poor.
If you plug something else, hub gets a connect change, khubd will
allow another debounce cycle and accept whatever happens.
In this case, when you're pulling the plug the hub receives a
momentary reconnect, so the software things something else was plugged.
I think perhaps the resistor harness is not good in the device,
or perhaps something is wrong with the connector.
