It should work out because of the way buddy always selects the minimum 
page size will tend to cluster the slab allocations together whether they 
are reclaimable or not. It's something I can investigate when slub has 
stabilised a bit.
However, in general, high order kernel allocations remain a bad idea. 
Depending on high order allocations that do not group could potentially 
lead to a situation where the movable areas are used more and more by 
kernel allocations. I cannot think of a workload that would actually break 
everything, but it's a possibility.

I can certainly kick it around a lot and see what happen. It's best that 
slub_min_order=2 remain an optional performance enhancing switch though.
