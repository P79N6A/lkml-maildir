/*

static int move_tasks(runqueue_t *this_rq, int this_cpu, runqueue_t *busiest,
                      unsigned long max_nr_move, struct sched_domain *sd,
                      enum idle_type idle)
{
...
So as the "documentation" states, it returns the number of tasks
actually moved.  For instance, The balancing code may request 4 tasks be
moved, but for various reasons, only 2 were actually moved to other
CPUs, move_tasks() would return 2.
