For anyone wanting to track the MANOS fork of Linux for the purposes of
monitoring bugs that show up in the ports of Linux code and drivers to
the Open Source NetWare, the MANOS mailing list is active, and you can
sign up at majordomo@vger.timpanogas.org.   It's set up the same way the
lists for linux-kernel are setup.
I will post the announcement of exactly which individuals code has been
identified to move over next week, when work will begin in earnest.  We
have moved most of the MANOS code over to gcc, and the next post of
MANOS will include the LLINK linkers we wrote that link DLL's and W2K PE
EXE's into a bootable OS, along with make scripts for gcc.
Bugs received on this list for existing Linux code will be reposted to
linux-kernel if they also affect Linux.  
:-)
Jeff
