The lockup is completely reproducable.  I've got several hundred perl
processes that are doing SNMP polling and updating RRD files.  At the same
time, an rm -rf is started on the same partition that the is holding the
perl script and RRD files.  The rm -rf is removing some directories and
files that are being updated by the perl script.  The perl script
recreates the directories and files if they don't exist.  It's likely that
a number of the files/directories are open for read and/or write at the
time of removal.
When the machine booted, fsck did run completely.  I wasn't in front of it
and was not able to capture any messages.  Unfortunately the machine is in
production and can't go down, so I had to revert to ext2.

I'll try to come up with a test case that duplicates the disk access
issues.
