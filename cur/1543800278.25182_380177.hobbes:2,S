I mentioned in my original post (maybe I wasn't clear enough) that
this is only in the documentation and not in the actual code (i.e. the
code has no advantage over 2.6 in this regard). This error comes from
the 2.4-ac/pac kernels from which this documentation originally comes.
Yes, I need to fix the documentation, I didn't get to do that yet.
I think you can get paranoid overcommit with either my patch or 2.6 by
setting /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_mode to 2 *and*
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio to 0, however.
