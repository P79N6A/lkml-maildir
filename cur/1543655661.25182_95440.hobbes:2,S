I am running Redhat 8.0 plus Win4Lin 4.0.7 on a Pentium III 600Mhz with 768MB RAM, 4 SCSI hard drives, an IDE hard drive, a Panasonic LF-D201 SCSI DVD-RAM, an HP deskjet 6122, and an HP Scanjet 7450C.  The Redhat kernel is 2.4.18-14, and the Win4Lin kernel is a patched version of the Redhat kernel.  I have DVD-RAM cartridges formatted FAT32 under Windows XP, and others formatted by udftools-1.0.0b2/mkudffs.  The fstab entry of interest is
/dev/scd0               /mnt/dvd             	auto	noauto,users,kudzu,rw,exec,uid=Tom,umask=000 0 0
Before I mount a udf cartridge, I get
[Tom@localhost Tom]$ ls -l /mnt
...
drwxr-xr-x    2 Tom      root         4096 Nov  5 11:20 dvd
[Tom@localhost Tom]$ mount /mnt/dvd
[Tom@localhost Tom]$ ls -l /mnt
...
drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root          140 Dec  6 19:13 dvd
[Tom@localhost Tom]$ umount /mnt/dvd
[Tom@localhost Tom]$ ls -l /mnt
...
drwxr-xr-x    2 Tom      root         4096 Nov  5 11:20 dvd
If I then mount a FAT32 cartridge, I get
[Tom@localhost Tom]$ mount /mnt/dvd
[Tom@localhost Tom]$ ls -l /mnt
...
drwxrwxrwx    3 Tom      Tom         16384 Dec 31  1969 dvd
...
[Tom@localhost Tom]$ mount
...
/dev/scd0 on /mnt/dvd type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uid=500,umask=000)
Each time I mount a udf cartridge, I have to do su to chown it before I can write to it in user mode.  Both the ownership and the permissions go back to the same root valuse, ignoring the fstab entry, until I do this. The behavior is the same for the Redhat kernel and the Win4Lin kernel. 
I can get around this problem by adding myself to the root group, I think, but changing the permissions does not help.  I found no clues in the mkudffs man page or in the linux-kernel archives.
Is there some trick for configuring to get around this problem?  Is this a bug?
