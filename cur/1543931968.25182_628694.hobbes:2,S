I'll confess to not knowing what it's up to here either, other than it
looks like a mechanism to cause a G1 bus reset. This is a progressive
read of the Boot ROM area and that is all under G1 control (as is the GD
Rom obviously)
Replacing it with a simple delay of any length or, say, a read of one
word and then a delay, doesn't work.
