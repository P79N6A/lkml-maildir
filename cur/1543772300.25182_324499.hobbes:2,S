All right, please take it a example of approach from legacy-side.
Already there are good working group, includes Linas, BenH, and Long.
They are also implementing some PCI error recovery codes (currently
setting home to ppc64), and I know their wonderful works are more PCI
Express friendly than my mysterious ia64 works :-)
However, I also know that it doesn't mean my works were useless.
Since there is a notable difference between their asynchronous error
recovery and my synchronous error detecting, both could live in
coexistence with each other.
How cooperate with is interesting coming agenda, I think.
Thanks,
