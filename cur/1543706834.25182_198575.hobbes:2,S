Is that code from B an interrupt handler?
If yes, then A should have called spin_lock_irqsave()
Otherwise, is that code from B a softirq or tasklet or timer handler?
If yes, then A should have called spin_lock_bh()
Otherwise, that code from B cannot run unless you are calling
schedule() from A after taking the lock, which is a bug in your code.
