Fedora essentially solves the problem with regularly release cycles and
policy. So once we know 2.6.10 or whatever is stable we can push that
for FC2 and FC3. We can push Xorg for FC2 because its in the
distribution description. Same for Gentoo except they'll probably ship
it before Fedora does.

For these setups the snapshots work well because you can package up an
extra driver in the knowledge that the vendor isnt going to do something
"Neat". If you want i915 in RHEL3 then that would certainly be the path
to take for example.
Distribution policies in part dictate the method. It doesn't imply any
one distribution policy is somehow "right".
