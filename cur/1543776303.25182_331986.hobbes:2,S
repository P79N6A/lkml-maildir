Yes. Except that if hwif is NULL, we'll have other oopses since we access 
that in other places.
Why _is_ hwif NULL anyway? That's another, unrelated thing, and should 
probably have a separate check and an early return.
So there's two unrelated issues: hwif being NULL is a serious error
regardless of any node issues, and pci_dev being NULL just means we aren't
a PCI device.
Bartlomiej?
