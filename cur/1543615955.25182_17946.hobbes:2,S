This (APIC errors) happened very often with my BP6 board too, but with
recent kernels I don't get many of these messages.
As for spurious interrupts, I had these coming every five minutes on my
Cyrix 6x86/SiS 5597 box. But this "settled" when I moved the box to another
corner in the room, and also did some interior adjustments of cables and
such (it is a server running in a very crammed slimline desktop box, with a
HUB taped to the floppy mount =)
