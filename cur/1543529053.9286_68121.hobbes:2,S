Linking is linking.  Statically or dynamically makes no difference
legally, it's only a technical issue.
It is however required that it is possible to link the binary to a
locally modified version of the used library.  With shared libraries
this is relatively simple, with static linking the binary distribution
has to contain separate object files for the library and the
application (additionally to the linked executable) so that it can be
relinked to a different library version.
IANAL, but you can look it up in section 6 of the LGPL for yourself.
