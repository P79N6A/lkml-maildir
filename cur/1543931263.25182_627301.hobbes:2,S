Hi, Lee-san.
Could you know what is the caller of page migration ?
system call ? hot removal ? or some new thing ?
Note: 2.6.24-rc4-mm1's cgroup/migration logic.
In 2.6.24-rc4-mm1, in page migration, mem_cgroup_prepare_migration() increments
page_cgroup's refcnt before calling try_to_unmap(). This extra refcnt guarantees 
the page_cgroup's refcnt will not drop to 0 in sequence of
unmap_and_move() -> try_to_unmap() -> page_remove_rmap() -> mem_cgroup_unchage().
