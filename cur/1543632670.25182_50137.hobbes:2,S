This thread may be of interest:

It's very awkward to analyse things like this at present.
For user -> kernel you could use something like syscalltrack.
As an aside, Nautilus (1.0.4) does stuff every 2 seconds
(checking is there a CD inserted) that causes the disk LED to flash.
The same action also causes the kernel (2.4.13) to fill up the ring
buffer with: "VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)".
