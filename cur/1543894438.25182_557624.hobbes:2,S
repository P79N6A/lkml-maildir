But since this elusive "spirit" is subject to everybody's interpretation 
of the preamble, you must surely admit that it remains just a matter of 
opinion ;)

On that particular piece of hw, yes. But who's granted you the right to 
*run* your modified copy *there* in the first place? GPLv2 explicitly 
steers clear of anything "other than copying, distribution and 
modification".

Then you agree that GPLv2 does not protect your freedom (taken for 
granted) to run a modified copy on any particular device, or am I 
misreading?

Exactly: they have a common ancestor, they are both derived from it. But 
there's no ancestry relationship *between* them (unlike your edited file 
example) so you cannot argue that one is a modification of the other. 
Hence, Tivo is not really *modifying* the copies it distributes with the 
device - they're *installing* brand new copies instead. They also choose 
not to offer everybody the same privilege :-|
Does this go against the intent of the GPLv2 authors? Probably. Does it 
go against the letter of GPLv2? Apparently not. Does it go against 
your/some people's interpretation of the GPL "spirit"? Obviously. Does 
it go against everybody's interpretation? Obviously not.
