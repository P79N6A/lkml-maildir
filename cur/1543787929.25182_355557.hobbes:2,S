Its a standard current Intel feature. See "mwait" in the processor
manual. The CPUs are also smart enough to do cache to cache transfers.
No special hardware no magic.
And unless I want my messages to cause interrupts and wake events (in
which case the APIC does it nicely) then any locked operation on memory
will do the job just fine. I don't need funky hardware on a system. The
first point I need funky hardware is between boards and that isn't
consumer any more.
