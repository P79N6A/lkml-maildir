uhm, so you claim that my argument is false, and your proof for that is 
a "non-upgradeable Tivo"?? <sarcasm> That is a _great_ idea. Not being 
able to patch security holes. Not being able to fix bugs. Not being able 
to add new features. Makes complete sense. Will be a hit on the market! 
Every PVR maker will flock from Windows to Linux i'm sure. </sarcasm>
really, do you even _read_ what you write? All your arguments so far 
were instantly debunkable. This is one of the lowest quality GPL 
discussions i was ever involved in ...
furthermore, the fact that the GPLv3 had to add carved out exceptions 
for the anti-Tivo languge is further _proof_ that the whole idea is 
absurd to begin with! It's like writing a nice new function to implement 
something, and then when it shows many design flaws, you'd not just 
admit that it's flawed and would get rid of it and redesign it, you'd 
instead pretend that it's fine and you'd carve out a few of the more 
common failure modes and would hack it around in that case.

here you prove that you cannot even read what i wrote. I wrote that this 
section has been removed from the GPLv3. What relevance does it have 
that in your opinion this section was redundant in the GPLv2?? It would 
clearly not be redundant in the GPLv3: it would contradict and 
_completely neutralize_ most of the crap from the GPLv3 that we are 
talking about here ...

dont you realize that declaring certain types of activities by hardware 
makers as being "against freedom" is _exactly_ such an activity that the 
GPLv2 did not attempt to control? I could tell you offhand a dozen more 
examples of human activities that restrict the 4 GNU freedoms of users 
_much more_ than the Tivo ever did: for example censure, opression of 
free speech, out of control climate, dictatorship, campaign financing 
laws, the WIN32 API and human stupidity. By your argument we'd have to 
add prohibition against those restrictions of freedom to the license 
too, right? Your argument still leads to absurd results, even now that 
you've modified it a few times already ...
