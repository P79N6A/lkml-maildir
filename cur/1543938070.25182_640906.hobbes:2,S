Both of these examples are directly copied out of the emacs manual.
Setting a variable before a module is loaded will override the default set
in the module.  No need to use a hook for something simple like this.
c-default-style is defined with 'defcustom':
   Declare SYMBOL as a customizable variable that defaults to VALUE.
   DOC is the variable documentation.
   Neither SYMBOL nor VALUE need to be quoted.
   If SYMBOL is not already bound, initialize it to VALUE.
so the intent is to allow the user to override the value by setting it
before the module is loaded.
