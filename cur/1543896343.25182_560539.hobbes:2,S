You're right.
At first, I implemented ioctls to misc device because of using misc sysfs.
But, Andrew Morton said "Using an ioctl() against a miscdev is rather 
untypical for networking.". So, I implemented ioclts to tty_driver.

It was for informational pupose. But, if we used symlink to the net_device 
kobject in sysfs, we could easily keep up with changing network device name by 
changing symbolic link.
In the case of configfs, Do we use config_item related to the network interface 
because the configfs doesn't have symlink that refers to net_device kobject
(e.g. "network_interface" in configfs, "network_interface" value is "eth0")?
I'm going to search configfs and modify interface to configfs.
Thanks
