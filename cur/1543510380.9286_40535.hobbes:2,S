I think you have a hardware problem...
	1) Is your SCSI autoterminating?
	2) If not, do you have it terminated correctly?
	3) Do you have your SCSI IDs set correctly, assuming ID7 for the
host?
	4) Does any other OS successfully install on your messed up system?
	5) Did you exhaust all other local resources before bothering high
level kernel gurus?
;)

It is seems not the problem of mem,
kernel don't recognize the 4 scsi disks,
it is said that:
Unable to mount root fs, kernel panic,
scsi hosts:0
what should I do to make kernel recognize the 4 scsi.

I think RH has a memory-problem when installing. It seems as if 
the ramdisk needs to allocate memory, and map that to just below 
1G. As you have >1G ram, it fails. Try to add 'memory=512M' at 
the bootpromt, and see what happens.
