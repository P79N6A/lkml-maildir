I wouldn't say he was useless, in fact better than the average bear 
IMO.  Once he understood that A) it was linux I'm talking about, and 
B) I knew what I was talking about, we got along famously.  He not 
only understood the lingo, he knew exactly what windoze util to run 
that did the same thing.  To find that level of expertise on the help 
desk was rather refreshing.

Yeah, he was somewhat taken aback when I said the list might run to 
600 msgs a day on a busy day.  He figured that much *had* to spam.  I 
said nope, that it was the official comm channel for the linux kernel 
developers and coders, clear up to Linus hisself.  It never hurts to 
polish the linux apple you know. :)
