Hmm.. Th ecurrent BK tree contains much of the anonvma stuff, so this 
might actually be a serious VM performance regression. That could 
effectively be hiding whatever problem you saw.
Andrea: have you tested under low memory and high fs load? Steven has 384M
or RAM, which _will_ cause a lot of VM activity when doing a full kernel
BK clone + undo + pull, which is what his test script ends up doing...
It would be good to test going back to the kernel that saw the "immediate 
problem", and try that version without CONFIG_PREEMPT.
