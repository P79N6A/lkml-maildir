This is wierd as i8042 does not use suspend_late/resume_early hooks and
so it is impossible for it to hang there. None of input drivers use these
hooks. Could it be that some other driver _after_ i8042 hangs?

I would say that every box that does not use PS/2 keyboard does this.
IOW every box with USB keyboard has legacy emulation turned on so quite
few of them...
