And I think that's wrong.
Holes do not have a disk mapping. We should not claim that they do.
The bits should make sense, and they should not contain redundant
information.
For example, if done right (I think my tree does it right), then you can
have an assert in ll_rw_block:
	if (!buffer_mapping(bh))
		BUG();
	if (buffer_new(bh))
		BUG();
and neither of them should EVER fire - because it's obviously a bug to try
to do IO with a buffer that hasn't got any mapping associated with it.
Similarly it's a bug to do anything but a write on a new buffer, and by
the time we do that we should have marked it dirty adn updated it, which
means that it's not new any more.
Contrast that strict logic with your rather convoluted version that is
redundant..

You can not EVER have a dirty non-mapped buffer. That would be an error.
You can have a up-to-date non-mapped buffer: it's just a hole, and is
zero-filled.

(Uptodate && !Mapped) is valid already - it's _used_ in pre-2.3.9-4
(except "Mapped" was called "Allocated", and I agree that "Mapped" is a
better name for it).
It _should_ be valid.
I think your problem is that you use "uptodate()" to check whether
something is mapped. Your patches had a number of these instances, and
it's wrong. I explicitly removed all of them from pre-2.3.9-4, and you
re-introduced the ugly behaviour, probably because you were working off an
older source base..
Anyway, I'll reboot into my current kernel, verify that it works (and that
none of my asserts trigger), and make a pre-5 so that we can synch up.
