Hmm... Well, it happened again on Friday night, and pouring through the 
syslogs, sendmail started refusing mail due to a load average of 18 and 
then 19...  This system, even under it's heaviest use, never breaks a 
system load average of 4-5.  Would a "stuck" spinlock result in an 
artificial inflation of system load averages (as a symptom)?

I'm building a 2.4.20 kernel using sources from kernel.org, and turning on 
the following options:
-->8--[Cut Here (.config)]-->8--
#
# Kernel hacking
#
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM=y
# CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is not set
# CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT is not set
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=y
-->8--[Cut Here (.config)]-->8--
Should I enable the other two, as well?
Also, do I've wired up the serial console on this machine to another machine 
(that's much more stable) so that I can access it remotely... should I try 
to set something up that simply monitors the serial console constantly and 
logs it to a file, or will I be able to get the info I need via a program 
like minicom by poking the kernel after the fact?

I'll add this in to the kernel as well.  Hopefully I'll be able to get some 
more useful information out of the system the next time this happens.
Thanks for all the pointers!
