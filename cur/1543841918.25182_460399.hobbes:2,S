And of course, after I spend time doing a -mm bisect, the problem evaporates
in -rc5-mm1. ;)

Looks like a self-inflicted screw-up in the .config.  The relevant diff
of the 2 .config files (the -rc4-mm3 had a 'patch -R < git-cryptodev' so
the new options aren't in that .config)
-# Linux kernel version: 2.6.18-rc4-mm3
-# Wed Aug 30 10:00:30 2006
+# Linux kernel version: 2.6.18-rc5-mm1

Does 'CONFIG_CRYPTOLOOP' need a 'SELECT CRYPTO_MANAGER' (or one of the other
symbols)?
