As you know I have had some concerns regarding a too early
notification in a swapless system.
I did a test with a populated page cache in a swapless system:
$ cat /bigfile > /dev/null # populate page cache
$ cat /proc/meminfo

Start to allocate memory, 10 MB every second, exit on notification.

The notification fires after only ~100 MB allocated, i.e., when page
reclaim is beginning to nag from page cache. Isn't this a bit early?
Repeating the test with swap enabled results in a notification after
~600 MB allocated, which is more reasonable and just before the system
starts to swap.
Cheers,
Daniel
