I use serial console with flow control and haven't seen any problems.
Can you describe your issue with more detail?
What actions are required to get this "does not work at all" state?
Are you passing a kernel parameter to enable flow control?
Are you saying that you get kernel messages if flow control is disabled,
but if you subsequently enable flow control, and provoke a kernel message,
you don't see any messages?  When you re-disable flow control, you do?
