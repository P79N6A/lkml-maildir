Dell laptops are known to have broken BIOS acpi code in regards to pci
express hotplug issues.  Seriously, we rely on acpi here for a lot of
this, and unless it is properly set up, it will not work.
And this is broken because Windows can't even handle this kind of thing,
so it isn't tested :(
So a short note to Dell might be helpful, although in the end, I think
this looks like a kernel issue as you have proven with your patch.
