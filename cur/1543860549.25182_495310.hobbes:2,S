The final 2.6.20 release note should mention the following commit in some
way: "[NETFILTER]: Kconfig: improve conntrack selection"
It will break existing iptable setups without warning becausee it
disables all related .config options. If one says NO to the new
NF_CONNTRACK_ENABLED "Netfilter connection tracking support",
NAT and other stuff will disappear.
One has to choose '2 "Layer 3 Dependent Connection tracking (OBSOLETE)"'
in a following question, to keep most of the existing modules during a
make oldconfig.
Its not obvious why make oldconfig still asks that many questions about
existing .config options.
