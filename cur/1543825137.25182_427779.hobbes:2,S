I'm experiencing the same problem, which sorta keeps me somewhat from
using an up-to-date kernel.
Also reported to Fedora:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=191506
rmmod'ing the EDAC driver makes those messages go away, but that's
sticking the head into the sand. 
Are actually errors happening when those messages pop up? The system
is running rock-solid since ages. It's only with the new kernels and
it's EDAC module where those errors do pop up...
Best regards,
Daniel
