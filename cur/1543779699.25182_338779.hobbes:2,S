i dont think there's any. user_mode(regs) gets the closest - it might 
make sense to generalize it over all arches.
update_process_times() gets an arch-independent 'was the tick user-space 
or kernel-space' flag, so the best starting point would be to look at 
the output of:
 for N in `find . -name '*.c' | xargs grep update_process_times |
  grep arch`; do echo $N; done | grep update_process_times |
   sort | uniq -c
which gives:
      2 update_process_times()
      1 update_process_times(CHOOSE_MODE(user_context(UPT_SP(regs)),
      6 update_process_times(user);
      1 update_process_times(user_mode(fp));
     33 update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
      2 update_process_times(user_mode_vm(regs));
so ~33 calls use user_mode(regs), and the rest needs to be reviewed and 
possibly changed. Looks doable.
