This is the only method that scales.
Developer has only 24 hours in each day, and sometimes he needs to eat,
sleep, and maybe even pay attention to e.g. his kids.
But bug reporters are much more numerous and they have more
hours in one day combined.
BUT - it means that developers should try to increase user base,
not scare users away.

Developer should let reporter know that reporter needs to help
a bit here. Sometimes a bit of hand holding is needed, but it
pays off because you breed more qualified testers/bug reporters.

Yes. Developers should not grow more and more unhelpful
and arrogant towards their users just because inexperienced
users send incomplete/poorly written bug reports.
They need to provide help, not humiliate/ignore.
I think we agree here.
