Dear list,
I have the following problem and cannot find anything about this on the
mailing list archive:
I am using xcdroast (version 1.6.1 of cdrecord!)  to burn cd's. My writer
is a philips 2600 scsi. My scsi card is a ADAPTEC 1515 ISA.
I am using this writer and this scsci card in my linux box for already 4
years! It always worked without any problems.
I am running SuSE linux 6.1 and am running always the latest STABLE
kernel. I compile my kernel using the adaptec 152x driver for the scsi
card.
On kernel 2.2.5 it still works fine.
However, every kernel above that, up to 2.2.10 makes my whole linux box
hang (X windows freeze and no telnet to it possible also..) as soon as I
start to write a cd. The write led on the writer does not even got a
chance to lit.
Kernel 2.2.5 still works 100% fine.... But I like to move on to the newer
kernels. Anyone any idea what is wrong here??
Thanx.
I'd appreciate a personal CC.
