tsort(1) is standard Unix, should be available everywhere for use in
Makefiles and whatnot. System startup may not be performance critical, but
why slow it down? Some solution like tsort(1)ing an intermediate file
sounds more robust than either #include:d files that are kept up to date by
hand (error prone) or sort at startup (bloat, slowdown).

If/when the gas for 16bit code gets included, you'd get the new linker for
free, isn't it?
