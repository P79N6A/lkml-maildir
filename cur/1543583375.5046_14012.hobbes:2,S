Oh yeah, of course. :-)

That's what Sun's autofs and am-utils call 'direct mounts', which are not 
yet supported by our autofs (unless I missed something recently). Direct 
mounts are good for some things, but not for everything. In particular, 
they are useless for cascading auto-triggered mounts (think 
/usr/local/src, /usr/local, and /usr, all automounted).
[and, btw, Linux _still_ doesn't properly support am-utils' direct mounts, 
although all that's needed is to remove LOOKUP_FOLLOW from path_init in 
sys_umount...]
As for bind mounts, I'll probably revisit them after I'm done with the 
Solaris autofs support in am-utils -- which will probably be a while. If I 
can get the thing to chain-trigger all the necessary mounts, we might be 
able to do something useful with it..
Thanks,
Ion
