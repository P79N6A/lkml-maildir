Subject: spontaneous reboot with 2.6.0-test1

I'm getting a spontaneous (and apparently random) reboot that happens 
every couple hours or so when running 2.6.0-test1. The reboot is 
instantaneous, goes straight to blank screen, followed immediately by 
bios startup screens. No error is visible or logged. The same machine is 
completely stable on 2.4.2x and on WinXP. I have run memtest overnight 
with no problems. The problem happens on either heavy or light load.
FWIW, I saw the same problems with earlier 2.5 kernels, but it wasn't 
untnil 2.5.75 or so that other things got stable enough for me to worry 
about this problem.
Can someone give me some pointers on the best way to track this 
down(e.g. which debug options in the kernel might be useful), or give me 
some guesses about what might be causing it if it's related to the 
hardware as shown by lspci -v below? Additional info: running debian 
sid, nfs mounting a number of partitions, gcc version 3.3.1 (from sid), 
and kernel compiled to target a K7 cpu as I'm running an Athlon XP.
-Thanks
