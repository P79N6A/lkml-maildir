I am really sorry that you were able to misunderstand and misrepresent 
such a simple sentence. Let me quote the full paragraph of what i said:

this makes it clear that i disagree with adding static markups for 
static tracers - but i of course still agree with static markups for 
_dynamic tracers_. The markups would be totally unusable for static 
tracers because there is no guarantee for the existence of static 
markups _everywhere_: the static markups would come and go, as per the 
"tracepoint maintainance model". Do you understand that or should i 
explain it in more detail?
