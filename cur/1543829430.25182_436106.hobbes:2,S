yeah, but there are two cases: places where we want to 'unify' array 
locks into a single type, and places where we want to treat them 
separately. The case where we 'unify' is the more common one: locks 
embedded into hash-tables for example. So i went for annotating the ones 
that are rarer. There are 2 right now: scheduler, hrtimers, with the 
hrtimers one going away in the high-res-timers implementation. (we 
unified the hrtimers locks into a per-CPU lock) (there's also a kgdb 
annotation for -mm)
perhaps the naming should be clearer? I had it named 
spin_lock_init_standalone() originally, then cleaned it up to be 
spin_lock_init_static(). Maybe the original name is better?
