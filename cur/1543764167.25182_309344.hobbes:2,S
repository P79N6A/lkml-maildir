I _do_ change them whenever they occur in code I maintain.  And each
time, it is an improvement.
o Functional code always has the same indentation.  I can mentally
  ignore the error path by ignoring all indented code.  Getting a
  quick overview is quite nice.
o Rather often, your preferred variant violates the 80 columns rule.
  If I need the line break anyway,...
o Keeping condition and functional code seperate avoids the Lisp-style
  bracket maze.  Some editors can help you here, but not needing any
  help would be even better, no?
