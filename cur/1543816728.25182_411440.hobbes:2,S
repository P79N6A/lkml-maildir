No. find_busiest_group() doesn't find an imbalance in this case..

Please don't do that... Its not for the complexity I say NO but we 
are kind of patching the code instead of addressing the root issue..

There is no config option to disable that portion of the code. Interaction
of this code with mainstream code is very small. Look at the
active_load_balance() and how this comes into play with the help of
migration thread(which gets activated through load_balance)

No. Upto now, this has been encapsulated very generically using cpu_power
and thats the reason why adding a sched domain for multi-core was simple.

Scheduler is a very critical piece in the kernel. We need to understand and fix
all the cases..
