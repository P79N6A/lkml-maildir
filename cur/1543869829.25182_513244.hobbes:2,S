The other solution, good for UP, would be to sychronize the TSC with
another clock source (HPET or timer), but it starts to look pretty much
like what is done right now.

For kernel and user space tracing, those small jumps are very annoying :
it can show, in a trace, that a fork() appears on a CPU after the first
schedule() of the thread on the other CPU : scheduling causality relationship
can become very hard to follow. This is only a sample case. Inaccuracy and
periodical modification of the clock time (non monotonic) can cause important
inaccuracy in performance tests, even on UP systems. A monotonic clock,
accessible from anywhere in kernel space (including NMI handler) and
from user space is very useful for performance analysis and, more
generally, for timestamping data in per cpu buffers so it can be later
reordered correctly.
