FWIW, this is exactly a type of add-on trace patch that could be
mooted by adoption of the ltt/systemtap "marker" facility.  With it,
you would not need so much code (e.g. no new user-space tools at all,
reuse of common tracing buffer logic, permanently placed hooks) and
would probably get more utility.

We in systemtap land have the same problem, and so far made do with
slightly postprocessed per-cpu TSC values.
