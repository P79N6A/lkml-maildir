Thanks for testing this out. So kexec on panic seems to be hanging. Are you 
booted in first kernel with commandline option nmi_watchdog? We have a known 
issue with nmi_watchdog and just now I have posted a patch.
Could you please try loading the new kernel with --console-vga or 
--console-serial option (depending on what console you are on) and post 
the output. 
Is it possible to post the .config file for both the kernels as well serial 
console output (if one is setup). This should help.
Thanks
Vivek
