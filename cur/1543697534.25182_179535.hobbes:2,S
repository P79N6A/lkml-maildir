I think one platform (early ARM?) cannot access bytes directly, and 
implement the access with read 16-bit, change 8-bit, write back 16 bit. 
Reading/writing pointers or longs is atomic.
Pavel: Do you know that atomic_set and atomic_read aren't memory barriers?
I.e.
-	psmouse->ack = 0;
+	atomic_set(&psmouse->ack, 0);
 	psmouse->acking = 1;
It's not guaranteed that all cpus will see psmouse->ack=0 before psmouse->acking=1. And adding the required memory barriers usually makes the code completely unreadable, thus I usually give up and switch to a spinlock.
