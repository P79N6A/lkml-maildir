Subject: Unable to totally get rid of CONFIG_INPUT options with 2.6.6

I have a machine whose only contacts with the outside world are ethernet and 
serial.  For some reason, it appears to be impossible to disable CONFIG_INPUT. 
Is this by design?  I have everything removed from the input config screen, but 
after some digging it appears that CONFIG_INPUT is not actually controlled by 
any config files.
Is this an issue?  Would I save anything by manually editing it out?
Thanks,
Chris
