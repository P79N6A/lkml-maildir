Actually, did you capture anything more after this?
There's an indication from a previous file you sent:
Target 1 Negotiation Settings
        User: 10.000MB/s transfers (10.000MHz, offset 127)
        Goal: 10.000MB/s transfers (10.000MHz, offset 15)
        Curr: 10.000MB/s transfers (10.000MHz, offset 15)
That for some reason the bus is tied to 10MHz (i.e. fast but not ultra).
The DV began at Ultra, but it should next drop down to FAST.
Also, when it finally boots up what does
/sys/class/spi_transport/target1:0:1/min_period
contain?
Thanks,
James
