We need to sync up to the current BK tree and see what needs to be
done. If remap_pfn_range() is arch-dep and only used in contexts where
you want to remap real physical address ranges (not "kernel physical"
address ranges) then we can reimplement remap_pfn_range() and remove
that CONFIG_XEN part of mem.c.
