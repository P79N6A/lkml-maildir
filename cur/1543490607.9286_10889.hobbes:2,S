To all those who replied (and others who thought about it),
Thank you!  While no one hit the problem on the head, some of
your replies jogged my mind into the right track and the
problem is solved.
I am embarassed to admit that it was a configuration error! It
does not seem to be emphasized in the pvm docs, but it is vitally
important that the /etc/hosts files on all of the cluster PCs
agree! (Obviously, you say!)
The ECONNREFUSED confused me greatly, because I could not see how
pvm could cause that return code.  When I upgraded to pvm 3.4.0, the
symptoms were essentially the same, but the error message was now
"Bogus packet".  If you comment out the last 2/3s of an if clause
in netinput (in pvmd.c) which apparently were necessary in earlier
releases (the comments, that is, not the conditions), the error
message goes back to being ECONNREFUSED.  That convinced me that
the problem was with pvm and not in the kernel, and from there it
was not too hard to find the config error.
My apologies to any pvm or kernel folks who I seemed to unjustly
question!  As always, many thanks!
Ken
