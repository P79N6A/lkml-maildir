As long as we get a fix for the mmconfig based probing issues in the 
other thread, I think this patch should go in.  Robert, maybe you could 
submit it along with this one (and an i386 equivalent)?  Type 1 config 
access is already a fallback for mmconfig for x86_64 at least, so it 
should be safe for non-extended access too, and it avoids problems with 
our lack of decode disable in the generic PCI probing code.
