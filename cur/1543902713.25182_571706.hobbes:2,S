Its a miniscule piece of code that is discarded on boot. Yes it might
make the image 100 bytes longer, but have you priced a 160GB disk
recently. I don't think 100 bytes of disk and 0 of memory really is worth
saving for any risk at all. Its not even worth the time to apply the
patch.

But you've no idea if this is true. Probably some of our other drivers
are bigger and have less users.
