Yes. A good PC bios will spot an hda boot fail, and try hdc. Good PC
bioses are alas slightly hard to find nowdays. In that set up raid1
works very well. Multipath is obviously a lot more complicated.

It relies on the BIOS to do the data loading off the md0. In your
scenario you would tell it the boot is on /dev/sdfoo where that is the
primary path. I guess the ugly approach would be to add lilo/grub
entries for booting off either path as two seperate kernel entries.

Works for me

Yes.
