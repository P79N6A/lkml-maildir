Right above those lines you would have seen:
   # Turn off swap, then unmount file systems.
   echo "Turning off swap"
   swapoff -a
   echo "Unmounting file systems"
   umount -a
   mount -n -o remount,ro /
   echo "Remounting remaining filesystems (if any) readonly"
   mount | awk '/ext2/ { print $3 }' | while read line; do
       mount -n -o ro,remount $line
   done
Your filesystems are mounted read-only already.
So yes.
