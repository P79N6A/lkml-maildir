I thought so, yes. However, I decided that it's too large a price to pay
for too little gain (the price being the deadlock on the inode semaphore
in the case we want to page out).
NOTE! The low-level filesystem may choose to use the inode semaphore for
that still - it's just that it's not mandated by the kernel any more, and
if the low-level FS does that it had better guarantee that while the inode
is locked there is no memory allocation activity that can cause a
deadlock..
