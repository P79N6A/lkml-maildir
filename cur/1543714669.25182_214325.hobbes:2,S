Something like the following will put you into one of the "realtime" 
scheduling classes, and you will take priority over the normally 
scheduled tasks.
struct sched_param p;
p.sched_priority=50;
if (sched_setscheduler(getpid(), SCHED_RR, &p) < 0) {
	perror("error while setting scheduler class");
	printf("continuing anyways, but results may not be as good\n");
}
The whole issue of soft-realtime is a complicated one, and there are 
many other things that should be done to maximise predictability.
