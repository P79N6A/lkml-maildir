   How does file descriptor passing work.  From what I can tell it uses the
   sendmsg and recvmsg calls.  Is this only process to process over a non
   ip socket  on the same machine (what's the right terminology for this,
   just a plain FIFO?), or could one conceivably pass a file descriptor
   over an ip socket?
File descriptors can only be passed over AF_UNIX sockets.
These are like fancy FIFO's on the local host using the
socket APIs for the communication and synchronization.
