(for others struggling with this) Per the fix reported at
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=163418
Updating my T43/FC5 to kernel 2.6.16-1.2122_FC5 and booting
with "combined_mode=libata" gets the DVD drive running at speed
as /dev/scd0 (although there doesn't seem to be any explicit
"dma enabled" indication).
Thanks Jeff et al.
