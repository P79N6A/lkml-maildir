        if (!test_bit(GET_APIC_ID(apic_read(APIC_ID)),

Really odd. That's usually a sign of a bad MP table.
Could you check your BIOS settings for an entry MP, or MPS, or
Multiprocessor Table?
Usually the options are 1.1 and 1.4 - just try the other one.
or try the attached patch - it prints 2 additional debug lines.
