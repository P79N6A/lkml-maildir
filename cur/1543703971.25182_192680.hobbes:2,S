This can't be done with the hotplug scripts.  I originally ran hotplug
synchronous before taking the CPU offline, and Greg KH said that
constitutes abuse 8(
Userspace can agree on a protocol *before* initiating the offline, of
course, in which case it's not a kernel problem.
You make an excellent point though: if you need 2 cpus on your system
to meet requirements, and you go down to one cpu, you have a problem.
But I think that's a "don't do that".
Thanks,
Rusty.
