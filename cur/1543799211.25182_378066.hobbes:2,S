OK - this really has me stumped. I have a asus A8N-SLI premium 
motherboard. It has 4 SATA ports on it. The ports are numbered 1 to 4. 
So somehow I asumed that port 1 would be /dev/sda ... port 4 would be 
/dev/sdd - but when I boot up the order is very different and doesn't 
make a lot of sense. How can a person predict what drives will get what 
device names. Sure would be handy to be able to know that.
HELP!
Thanks in advance. My server is down - struggling with this issue.
