The block layer code works just fine with host queueing, but I agree
that it may not be appropriate for the SCSI tcq API.
In any case, I'm fine with merging the driver with existing tagging --
since its known to work -- and then pondering the best course of action
for tagging APIs in a later patch to the shasta driver.
Let's go ahead and get it in, minus the requested tagging changes but
including the other requests.
