I think the following lines are suitable for other bridges besides
nvidia's, :) :
===================
+		if (pci_enable_msi_ht_cap(dev) != 0) {
+			return 0;
+		} else {
+			/* Get upstream bridge device handle */
+
+			bridge_dev = dev->bus->self;
+			while(bridge_dev != 0) {
+				if (pci_enable_msi_ht_cap(bridge_dev) !=
0) {
+					return 0;
+				} else
+					bridge_dev =
bridge_dev->bus->self;
+			}
+
+			return 1;
+		}

Isn't there a way we can make this work for any upstream HT bridge,
rather than only for specific NVIDIA chipsets?
