The eepro driver.  But dbench is a disk I/O test (simulates the disk
component of netbench).  I just ran it with the network interfaces disabled
and didn't see any difference.  On this run throughput was 6.6MB/s with 22%
CPU utilization.  A similar box with interfaces also disabled, only 2 CPUs
and 2.3.40 just completed with 62MB/s throughput and 118% utilization.
