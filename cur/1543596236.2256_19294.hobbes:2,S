What is the point of displaying penguins in framebuffer mode if it is going
to change the video mode set by the vga= command line parameter?
I like to set my display to 50 lines. This won't stay when the penguin 
comes up.
In standard character mode, this isn't a problem. So, how do we fix this?
Is there a command line parameter that prevents the penguin logo from 
coming up?
