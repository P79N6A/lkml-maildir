Hi Alan, et al.
Now that 2.2.0 is out, it looks like we've stabilized on a quite new
module system for the sound modules.  I'd be happy to volunteer to update
the docs for sound module autoloading - the documentation
directory instructions for sound loading are out of date and very
soundcard specific.  I'd like to change that, but that requires me to
fully understand how the new system is supposed to work.  I'd appreciate
it if you could give some direction in this matter (specifically if
anything below is conceptually wrong)
A user makes a connection to /dev/audio or /dev/dsp, or ... ->
First, it seems as if a request for the module "char-major-14" should
result in loading the soundcore module for generic sound support.
Then, when soundcore gets loaded, soundcore runs request_module for
sound-slot-0 (at least on my machine), and sound-service-0-3.  Should
sound-slot-0 be aliased to the actual sound-card that will be initialized,
or does it refer to one of the higher layers, such as the OSS sound.o
module, or a generic ALSA module?  What does sound-service-0-3 represent,
the first number looks like it refers to the service being a child of the
slot that was requested just before, and the 3 represents a number for the
type of service requested.  Is there a list of these numbers somewhere?  I
looked at the code a little bit, but wasn't able to find anything
definite.
If you can give me a few hints, I'd be more than happy to flesh them out
into a documentation file.
