I agrre, that is what seems to happen.  With one little addition: at
least on Solaris the syscall in the end nevertheless returns EINTR.
I'm not sure whether this is useful but it might be ok since
a) code today already has to handle EINTR
b) it provides the user more information (e.g., that she could find out
   that the process has possibly slept for a long time)
