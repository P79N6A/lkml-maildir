It's a shame, because `tar' doesn't save things like inode attributes and
places unnecessary load on the VFS layer.  It also takes considerably
longer than dump did on one backup server I admin - like ~12 hours to back
up ~26G in ~414k inodes to a tape capable of about 1MB/sec.  But that's
probably the old directory hashing thing again, there are some
reeeeaaallllllly large directories on that machine...
Ah, the joys of legacy.
