This could only break programs using the hardware debug registers and following
across clone.

It would be nice to have a uniform behavior across architectures on this.
this is purely on OS policy descision. As I said, there is enough support
in ptrace (and probably in utrace) to catch the clone event and setup the
breakpoints in the new task if requested.
The reason I detected this is because the pfmon tool was entering some
infinite loop on SIGTRAP searching for breakpoints it had not set on a
child process. The pfmon tool was designed on IA-64, so it did not assume
breakpoints were systematically inherited quite the contrary as it provides
an option to explicitely inherit them.

Well, a ptrace expert pointed out to me that there is a controlled
leak to the next thread. That leak is terminated in traps.c by noticing
that you get a breakpoint trap but in a task which has debugreg[7]=0.
In that case, the kernel simply clears dr7 to shut down any subsequent
breakpoint traps. That kind of lazy stop, saves having to clear dr7 in
__switch_to() when switching from a task using the debug registers to
one which does not. i still have to convince myself this works in all cases,
especially if that task suddenly starts using the debug registers and program
the other debug registers BEFORE dr7 (assuming it was zero).
