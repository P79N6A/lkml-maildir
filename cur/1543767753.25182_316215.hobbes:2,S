Pine is usurally better for handling patches than other mailers.
In pine, you can save a message into a mbox using very few keystrokes,
and if the patches are not encoded, patch can parse them from there.
BTW: I wrote a tool for handling MIME mails. Originally it was intended to
catch spam in procmail, but it can safe the individual parts into seperate
files, too. Maybe this is usefull:

+mail/mime-analyzer/
(You'd use "cd $destdir && formail < $mbox -s mail-analyzer -copy_all -")

According to my calculations the problem doesn't exist.
