Your version of `ifconfig` is probably broken (just like mine).
`strace` it and see:
ioctl(5, SIOCGIFFLAGS, 0xbffff620)      = 0
ioctl(5, SIOCSIFFLAGS, 0xbffff620)      = 0
_exit(0)                                = ?
In this case the flags were gotten with SIOCGIFFLAGS, then the
exact same stuff was written back with SIOCSIFFLAGS.
