I was browsing linux kernel to undetsnand how kernel preemption does
work. I was hacking around schedulee_tick and other functions called
out of timer interrupt and was unable to found any call to schedule()
or switch_to() to peempt currently running task, instead just mangling
around current and inactive runqueues.
That leads me to a thought that currently running task wont be
preempted within time-tick, instead it might happends in the next call
to preempt_schedule out of spin_lock for instance.
