Yeah, fully agree.  This is on my research "todo" list.  My theory is 
that the ultimate adaptive-timeout algorithm here would essentially be 
the following:
*) compute the context-switch pair time average for the system.  This is 
your time threshold (CSt).
*) For each lock, maintain an average hold-time (AHt) statistic (I am 
assuming this can be done cheaply...perhaps not).
The adaptive code would work as follows:
if (AHt > CSt) /* dont even bother if the average is greater than CSt */
    timeout = 0;
else
    timeout = AHt;
if (adaptive_wait(timeout))
    sleep();
Anyone have some good ideas on how to compute CSt?  I was thinking you 
could create two kthreads that message one another (measuring round-trip 
time) for some number (say 100) to get an average.  You could probably 
just approximate it with flushing workqueue jobs.
