I hope that design wouldn't mean that you can't configure a kernel on a  
machine different from the one supposed to run it, nor that you can't  
gather the autoconfiguration info on a machine where you won't build the  
kernel and don't have the full kernel sources.
Because that's a rather common situation in nontrivial installations.
