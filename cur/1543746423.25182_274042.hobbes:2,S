I'd be inclined to whack an #if 0 around functions such as this rather than
removing them.  Someone may come along one day and do some work on the
driver, and nicstar_read_eprom_status() may prove to be useful to them.
Nobody would ever thing to go trolling back through the revision history
looking to see if previously-interesting stuff was deleted.
