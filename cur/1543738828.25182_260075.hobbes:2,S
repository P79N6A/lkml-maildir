I think patch size is an issue, but I also think that , eventually, we
should change all spin_lock calls that actually lock a mutex to be more
distinct so it's obvious what is going on. Sven and I both agree that
this should be addressed. Is this a non-issue for you? What does the
community want? I don't find your code or ours acceptable in it's
current form , due to this issue.
With the addition of PREEMPT_REALTIME it looks like you more than
doubled the size of voluntary preempt. I really feel that it should
remain as two distinct patches. They are dependent , but the scope of
the changes are too vast to lump it all together.
