I don't see anything in set_thread_area() which restricts them to data
segments.  Btw, NPTL isn't the only userspace code which uses this
function.
Admittedly it would be quite odd to use set_thread_area() to create
and use a GDT code segment - but given that you can do it, it would be
_really_ odd if prefetch instructions gave spurious faults in these
segments yet were fixed up elsewhere.

Shouldn't spurious faults in prefetch instructions in vm86 mode be
fixed up too?
