Yes, as i said those was from several hours later...

I have had it happen twice before, without tracker running...
It didn't quite get to the oom stage, it just failed alot of allocations
while having 1.5 or more memory locked in cache.

I saw that again and thought "Lets update and see what happens" and then
this happened. I haven't had the same version of trackerd go haywire on
me before, i haven't had a oom kill gnome-session or metacity before.
