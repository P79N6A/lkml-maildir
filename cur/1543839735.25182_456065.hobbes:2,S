Yes with autofs version 4, because of the nesting of mounts which also 
introduces issues with expiration. Its basically due to the dependencies 
and the relatively simple minded way they are handled.
In version 5 they are mounted and umounted on demand.

v2 and v3 won't do the expire, will they?
Not updating the mtab will be a problem for me also and possibly for 
users that expect to see mounts in it.
The "/net" functionality is a standard, expected automounter function.

The xdev (assume you mean NFSv4 submounts) mounts will be the area I need 
to work on, for sure.
I don't quite understand the "open will cause the automount" for NFS 
version < 4. The automounter calls mount(8) when it gets a packet from the 
autofs[4] kernel module due to an access.
I expect that I won't have to do much at all for xdev mounts except to be 
able to recoginize them and their owners so I can leave them alone. The 
expire function might be a bit interesting.
