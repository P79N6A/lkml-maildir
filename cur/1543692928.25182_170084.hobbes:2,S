I think there are better aproaches for deciding when a task should be
interactive than the current one based in how much does the task sleep.
I'm afraid this selection criteria leads to a scheduler that isn't
predictable for situations that aren't the ones for which is tuned to work.
Of course I may be wrong, but to me, seems that saying explicitly 
which tasks are interactive sounds better.
