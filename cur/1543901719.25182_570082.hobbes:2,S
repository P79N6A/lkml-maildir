Hi Remy,
I think Thomas may have worked on a port of recent LTTng to the -RT
kernel.
If not, I think you needs are quite easy to fulfill with a small amount
of work.
Basically, you could take a recent copy of LTTng, which comes in a set
of logically separated patches:
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/patch-2.6.22-rc4-mm2-lttng-0.9.10.tar.bz2
Follow the Compatibility List to see which other packages you need
(ltt-control and lttv) :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/svn/ltt/branches/poly/doc/developer/lttng-lttv-compatibility.html
Then, when applying the LTTng patches to the -RT kernel, a few things
must be taken care of:
1 - "instrumentation" patches : you won't care about most of the
rejects, since you only care about the schedule() calls.
2 - You'll have to see how schedule() is instrumented and port that to
the CFS.
3 - Make sure the Linux Kernel Markers (linux/marker.h) _really_ call
preempt_disable()/preempt_enable() (is it a underscored function in
-rt ?). It is used for correct teardown of probe handlers with
synchronize_sched(). Probe sites execute very quickly, do it won't add
significant latency to your system.
4 - Ping me for problematic rejects.
