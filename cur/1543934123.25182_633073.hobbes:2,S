Then I need a replacement equivalent for the ATA layer and all the other
drivers using it to indicate stuff that *IS* experimental, or not yet
known to be highly robust. Drivers are not the same as core code Ingo and
the world driver writers live in is very different to the one you operate
in as is clearly shown by this and by the _p discussion.
Still NAK.  As the alternative is
CONFIG_ATA_EXPERIMENTAL, CONFIG_NET_EXPERIMENTAL,
CONFIG_VIDEO_EXPERIMENTAL, ... all being added by developers
We will also need experimental badly in future when the EU liability
rules (and probably the US ones in a similar time scale) change so that
liability applies to software, because then it will be very important to
clearly label code that is experimental or development code as such.
