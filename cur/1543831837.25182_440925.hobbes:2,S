Daniel,
If the patch that originated in bugzilla 5000 fixes
your system, it would be most helpful if you could
update that bug report with your test results.
If you tested a modified patch, then it would be best
to attach that path to the report so that others could
test your modification also.
We use the RESOLVED state to signify that a patch exists
in the bug report that may fix the issue and it needs
review, testing, and consideration for forwarding to mm
and untimately to linus, depending on the results.
Looks like # 5000 moved from RESOLVED back to ASSIGNED
when the resume regression was found.
It should be marked RESOLVED now that there is a follow-on
patch to address that regression.
thanks,
-Len
