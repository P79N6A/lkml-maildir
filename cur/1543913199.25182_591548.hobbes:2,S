Hi Linus,
We have a few XFS fixes for 2.6.23 (meant to do this earlier).
They have been in sgi dev tree and mm tree for a while.
Please pull from the for-linus branch:
     git pull git://oss.sgi.com:8090/xfs/xfs-2.6.git for-linus
With shortlog:

     [XFS] fix nasty quota hashtable allocation bug
     This git mod: 77e4635ae191774526ed695482a151ac986f3806
     converted to a "greedy" allocation interface, but for the quota hashtables
     it switched from allocating XFS_QM_HASHSIZE (nr of elements)
     xfs_dqhash_t's to allocating only XFS_QM_HASHSIZE *bytes* - quite a lot
     smaller! Then when we converted hsize "back" to nr of elements (the
     division line) hsize went to 0. This was leading to oopses when running
     any quota tests on the Fedora 8 test kernel, but the problem has been
     there for almost a year.

commit 265c1fac38e37e828df09965406e9cc20bfa3588

     [XFS] fix sparse shadowed variable warnings
     - in xfs_probe_cluster rename the inner len to pg_len. There's no harm
       here because the outer len isn't used after the inner len comes into
       existence but it keeps the code clean.
     - in xfs_da_do_buf remove the inner i because they don't overlap
       and they are both the same type.

commit ee5c80239d5f152d99f69165afbd115518353563
Author: Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org>

     [XFS] fix ASSERT and ASSERT_ALWAYS
     - remove the != 0 inside the unlikely in ASSERT_ALWAYS because sparse now
       complains about comparisons between pointers and 0
     - add a standalone ASSERT implementation because defining it to
       ASSERT_ALWAYS means the string is expanded before the token passing
       stringification. This way we get the actual content of the
       assertion in the assfail message and don't overflow sparse's
       stringification buffer leading to sparse error messages.

     [XFS] Fix sparse warning in kmem_shake_allow
     We can't return a masked result of a __bitwise type. Compare it to 0 first
     to keep the behaviour without the warning.

     [XFS] Fix sparse NULL vs 0 warnings
     Sparse now warns about comparing pointers to 0, so change all instance
     where that happens to NULL instead.
