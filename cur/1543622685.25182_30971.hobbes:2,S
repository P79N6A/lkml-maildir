 Yes, I had read that.  Do you know of any effort to consolidate the 
 crypto libs in LIDS, patch-int, and FreeS/WAN KLIPS?  I'd like to think 
 that they can be maintained more efficiently and result in lower overhead
 and integration effort if the core crypto algorithms are consolidated
 among those three.
 (I remember someone found three? or four? different implementations of the
 same checksum code in the mainstream kernel a couple of years ago; I hope
 that's been fixed long since).
 (Any flames about my armchair coaching and pointed suggestions that I
 get in there and help with this are welcome --- off the list! I won't take 
 offense, I just don't want to burden everyone else's mailbox with that).
