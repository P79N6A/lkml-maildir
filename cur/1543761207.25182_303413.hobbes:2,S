There was NO DATA read or written! The read() call returns immediately
without reading anything. Look at the code, assume nothing. This
is a blocking read from standard-input.

Somebody added some very dumb check of the input value
of a read() length that occurs before anything is
actually read.
Previously, a read(), which is a kernel write to user-data
space, would seg-fault if the read exceeded the data-space
that had been mapped. It is done by the CPU, it generates
a trap. The performance cost, when done by the CPU, if
the data doesn't exceed bounds, is zero. Now, there is
a beginning check (a wrong check BTW), in software,
before the data is even obtained from the device.
