Something more sophisticated will happen someday, this is what we have
now.

I'm not saying it does not work, I'm saying I don't want my users to
fool with kernel modules when we know the default should not be HID for

switching argyll to it, just do it. I don't care as long as I don't have
to maintain workarounds distro-side.
