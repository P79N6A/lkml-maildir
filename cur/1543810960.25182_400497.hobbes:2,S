No it hasn't been fixed. ...and no, this is not a problem that only
affects NFS: it just happens to give a more noticeable performance
impact due to the larger latency of NFS over a 100Mbps link.
I will get round to this, but the general opacity of the current
readahead code has been a bit of a put-off in the face of other NFS
problems.
Cheers,
