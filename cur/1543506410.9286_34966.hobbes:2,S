That is a good idea too, but it better not be the only fix.
Mailing lists may have valid from: adresses.
My suggestion for blocking other lists is that the non-list spam doesn't
seem
to be the big problem here.  Annoying for sure, but a lot
lower than the list volume.  They can be dealt with in the ordinary
complain-to-ISP way.
These list subscriptions were different, as they
forced the move to x-linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu
The attack may be repeated for that address of course.
Blocking lists would make the easy mass-destruction impossible.
