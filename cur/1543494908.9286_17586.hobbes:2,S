That would have been easy to find out - you've got the source ..
% find ./ -name '*.h'|xargs grep kernel_uid_t
./include/linux/types.h:typedef __kernel_uid_t          uid_t;
./include/asm-i386/posix_types.h:typedef unsigned short __kernel_uid_t;
./include/asm-mips/posix_types.h:typedef long           __kernel_uid_t;
./include/asm-alpha/posix_types.h:typedef unsigned int  __kernel_uid_t;
./include/asm-m68k/posix_types.h:typedef unsigned short __kernel_uid_t;
./include/asm-sparc/posix_types.h:typedef unsigned short __kernel_uid_t;
./include/asm-ppc/posix_types.h:typedef unsigned int    __kernel_uid_t;
./include/asm-sparc64/posix_types.h:typedef unsigned int __kernel_uid_t;
./include/asm-sparc64/posix_types.h:typedef unsigned short __kernel_uid_t32;
./include/asm-arm/posix_types.h:typedef unsigned short     __kernel_uid_t;
From my understanding, mips, alpha, ppc and sparc64 should have UIDs > 2^16
