Well, in legacy mode (a.k.a. normal), each ATA port (a.k.a. channel 
a.k.a. bus) gets their own interrupt, which is never shared with another 
device.
In native mode (a.k.a. enhanced), two ATA ports share a single PCI 
interrupt.  Further, this interrupt may be shared with any number of 
other PCI devices.
So, high interrupt count is necessarily a worry because you're probably 
seeing a coalescing of multiple interrupt counts into one big one.
