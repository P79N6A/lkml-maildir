It seems so - at least APM doesn't work, but ACPI does

If I understand correctly, I have to wait until someone
is taking up this task? Unfortunately I have now clue
about kernel proramming - well, in fact I am not even a
real programmer (I'm doing rocket engines and reusable
launch vehicle stuff).  Well in this case, whoever is
going to pick-up on this and reading this lines now,
please send you your patches, I would be pleased to do
some testing on the Libretto.
Question 2: Is there any possible workaround for the
moment? Can I e.g. "hardwire" IRQs, e.g. reading them
under Windows and hardcoding them? In this case, there
could be at least a kernel for the Libretto - the
hardware can not be modified anyway.
Thanks,
Aron
