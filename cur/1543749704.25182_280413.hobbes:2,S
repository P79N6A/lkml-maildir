Confirmed.
On 2.6.10-rc3 with Con's patch, when I run the memory eater, there is a high 
kswapd CPU load for about 10 seconds, then things are OK. The screen never 
freezes at that time or at any other moment.
When I add vm-pageout-throttling.patch from -mm, the CPU load in the beginning 
is somewhat less constant but remains there.
While it would be nice to fix the high CPU load, the system is usable as it 
is.
