I quite forgot the most grotesque problem with this, which in my opinion
completely eliminates the possibility of inherited permissions on any
even vaguely-POSIX-like system.
What happens if you have a file with two links in directories with
different inheritable permissions set? What are its permissions now?
Surely it doesn't depend on where you happened to open it from!
