Hi, don't feel much better but thanks a lot!
in conclusion ? 
1- hdc=ide-scsi, now should be hdc=ide-cd for general cd-writer, because
cdrecorder don't need scsi emulation anymore.
2- as hdc already is ide-cd by default, therefore is not necessary to
write it and what should be made is erase the line hdc=ide-scsi.
Correct ?
