Precisely. Kendall, what is described above is a real-world example that
binary compatibility is in your hands - and one doesn't have to do anything
with the kernel. Just provide your customers with a script that will detect
their kernel configuration and tools used to compile it, then submit that
to your server that will handle the rest and let them download the compiled
drivers. *Shrug*
