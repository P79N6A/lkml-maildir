Hi,
RH 8.0
======
Thanks for your response.
I am going to install alsa and oss sound packages which need
kernel (kernel-2.4.18-18.8.0 already running in my OS)
kernel-source (kernel-source-2.4.18-18.8.0 already running in my OS)
kernel-headers
and I could not find "kernel-header-2.4.18-18.8.0" from Internet.  Can I
use "kernel-headers" of different version (from RH8.0 CD)?
B.Regards
Stephen
