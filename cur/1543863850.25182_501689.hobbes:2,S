Alloc stands for resource allocation: in a subsystem where resource 
allocation depends on a tunable value, we should tune up that value 
prior to the alllocation itself. Let's come back to the ipc subsystem 
example: ipc_addid() is the routine that adds an entry to an ipc array. 
The 1st thing it does (via grow_ary()) is to allocate some more space 
for the ipc array if needed, i.e. if the ipc tunable value has 
increased. That's why the tunable should be tuned up before calling 
ipc_addid().
AKT_DOWN is the reverse operation: we are freeing resources, so the 
tunble has no reason to remain with a big value.

You're completely right: setting the min value to the default one should 
be enough!
