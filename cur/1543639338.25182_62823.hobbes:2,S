I did not see any news on the alpha/linux topic in lkml lately.
What is the way to keep in touch with the "private club" to help/
assist in getting further to a running 2.5.x kernel on alpha? I
am still on 2.4.18 on my test system.
Did anybody use gcc-3.0.x or gcc-3.1? With gcc-3.0.4 I 
successfully built 2.4.18 but some applications don't run
correctly (eg. MySQL -> Parser). Is the kernel compilable
with gcc-3.1? Today I am using gcc-2.95.3 and I think is
ok; better than egcs (generates less unaligned traps at
runtime without changing the source).
Greetings,
Martin
