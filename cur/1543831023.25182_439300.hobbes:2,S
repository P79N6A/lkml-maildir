Subject: .exit.text section in vmlinux

Hi guys,
I understand why ".exit.text" is present in the case of modules, but I
can't get my head around why it is included in the vmlinux file.
Functions like the ones below puzzle me:
kernel/configs.c: static void __exit ikconfig_cleanup(void)
drivers/net/ne2k-pci.c: static void __exit ne2k_pci_cleanup(void)
drivers/net/ne2k-pci.c: static void __devexit ne2k_pci_remove_one
(struct pci_dev *pdev)
I can see how the last "__devexit" function might be called during
some hotplug event, but are the two "__exit" functions ever going to
be called from the kernel? Since my kernel is configured without
CONFIG_HOTPLUG both both "__exit" and "__devexit"  end up in the
".exit.text" section.
The linker script arch/i386/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S mentions the following:
  /* .exit.text is discard at runtime, not link time, to deal with references
     from .altinstructions and .eh_frame */
The text above seems to answer my question, but I cannot say I fully
understand the comment. I'd appreciate if someone could explain a bit
more if possible.
Ok, so the section should be discarded at runtime. Sounds ok. But
where in the code is this section discarded? -ENOSYS?
Thanks,
/ magnus
