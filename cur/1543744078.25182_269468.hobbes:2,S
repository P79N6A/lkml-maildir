It is already defacto implementation standard - every subsystem has a core
modules (pci, usbcore, serio) plus modules (drivers) actually talking to
hardware and registering devices (ports, whatever) with the corresponding
core. It is just a matter of splitting cleanup functions into core and
device-specific parts.

I think there are much more kobjects than attrs.
