Suspend/Resume code in agpgart is virtually non-existant.
I've not had chance to try suspend recently, but when I last looked
at it, it wasn't in a state that made debugging particularly easy.
(It's hard to see if you got things right, if it won't resume for eg).
I've not had chance to try it again more recently. It's possible
the various changes that have gone on over the last month or so have
improved the situation somewhat.
