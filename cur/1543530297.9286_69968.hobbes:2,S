Yes, I know how VM works - I thought, though, that Linux allocated memory
when instructed to via malloc().

Unless that memory hog takes ALL the memory, which is the circumstance
this thread was discussing. At this point, there isn't any memory left for
anyone, so processes start dying. We need to make sure it is the memory
hog which dies, not the other processes.

Until you reach an OOM state, at which point most things runs rather dead.
EXCEPT the memory hog, with the old behaviour - almost everything else
dies. We need something to kill the memory hog before it kills everything
else - enter Rik's patch.
