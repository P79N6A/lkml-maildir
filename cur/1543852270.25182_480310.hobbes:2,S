I'm not a lawyer, but from my understanding of the GPL and that page:

So the agreement says nothing about Novell <=> Microsoft patent  
issues or lawsuits.

But it does say that Microsoft agrees not to sue Novell's customers  
over patent issues in the GPL software that Novell distributes to its  
customers.  What this means is that Novell's customers effectively  
have patent licenses from Microsoft permitting them to use any GPL  
software distributed by Novell involving Microsoft's patents.
The real question is how this affects Novell's customers.  Can they  
distribute GPL'd software that "infringes" on a Microsoft patent?   
They have the rights to use that software but anyone who received  
that software from them would not, therefore according to the GPL  
they may not distribute at all, right?  In my opinion the only way  
that Novell's customers could legally distribute such "infringing"  
software would be by waiving the protection offered them by Microsoft  
through Novell.
Of course, this also means that it would be illegal for Microsoft to  
distribute such software; but I doubt that's likely to be an issue.
