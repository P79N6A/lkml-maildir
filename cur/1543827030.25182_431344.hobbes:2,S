The patches in this thread add IPC namespace functionality
additionally to already included in -mm tree UTS namespace.
This patch set allows to unshare IPCs and have a private set
of IPC objects (sem, shm, msg) inside namespace. Basically, it is 
another building block of containers functionality.
Tested with LTP inside namespaces.
