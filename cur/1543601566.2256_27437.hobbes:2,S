Same over here with an IBM PS/2 keyboard that originally came with an
IBM PS2 model 55SX. The IBM keyboard is connected to an Asus M8300
laptop. The keyboard of that laptop has the interesting "feature" that
Alt-SysRQ-m sets the loglevel to 0, and Alt-SysRQ-[suob] also set the
loglevel to a different value instead of doing their job.
