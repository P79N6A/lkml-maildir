# grep -rw FINETUNE * | grep -v timex.h
# grep -rw CLOCK_TICK_FACTOR * | grep -v timex.h
# grep -rw CLOCK_TICK_RATE * | grep -v timex.h
drivers/char/ftape/lowlevel/ftape-calibr.c:     return (10000 * count) / ((CLOCK_TICK_RATE + 50) / 100);
The only interesting place where is CLOCK_TICK_RATE used is in linux/timex.h
to define LATCH. Which subsequently is only used in arch specific code
and ftape again.
Ftape's use of it is buggy, because it lacks the needed locking.
So, it seems like CLOCK_TICK_RATE isn't needed by non-arch-specific
code.
And FINETUNE isn't used at all.
But ... the fact that kernel uses it ... probably doesn't mean that
userland doesn't.
