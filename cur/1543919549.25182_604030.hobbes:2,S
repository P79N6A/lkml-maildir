Looks good. Some suggestions on improving the wording.

Generated before new memory becomes available in order to be able to 
prepare subsystems to handle memory. The page allocator is still unable
to allocate from the new memory.

Generated if MEMORY_GOING_ONLINE fails.

Generated when memory has succesfully brought online. The callback may 
allocate from the new memory.

Generated to begin the process of offlining memory. Allocations are no 
longer possible from the memory but some of the memory to be offlined
is still in use. The callback can be used to free memory known to a 
subsystem from the indicated node.

Generated if MEMORY_GOING_OFFLINE fails. Memory is available again from 
the node that we attempted to offline.
> + +MEMORY_OFFLINE
Generated after offlining memory is complete.
