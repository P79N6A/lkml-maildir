Oh, always panic-happy Pavel ;). It really depends on what kind of
device has faled to resume. If the device is really needed for writing
image then panic is the only recourse, but if it some other device you
resuming just ignore it, who cares...
Btw, I dont think that doing selective resume (as opposed to selective
suspend and Nigel's partial device trees) would be so much
complicated. You'd always resume sysdevs and then, when iterating over
"normal" devices, just skip ones not in resume path. It can all be
contained in driver core I believe (sorry but no patch, for now at
least).

Not really, I won't be able to write any code anything till next week I think.
