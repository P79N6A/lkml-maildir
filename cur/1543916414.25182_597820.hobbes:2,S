Adding linux-ide and linux-scsi as CC like Andrew did with my last report.
I still have trouble with my Silicon Image, Inc. SiI 3132 Serial ATA
Raid II Controller as reported on 2.6.23-rc4-mm1 on the new
2.6.23-rc6-mm1.
I'm not 100% sure if this caused by the sg chaining, but the patch
from 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/10/251
 which touches that chaining
makes a difference, so it might be related.
First report: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/1/92
With patch it fails fewer times: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/14/107
To update the statistik:
prior to 2.6.23-rc4-mm1: no trouble with any drives on the SiI 3132.
2.6.23-rc4-mm1 without patch: 2 out of 2 bad.
back to 2.6.23-rc3-mm1: 18x good.
2.6.23-rc4-mm1 with patch:  2 out of 8 bad
after that second mail:
2.6.23-rc4-mm1 with patch: 1 out of 5 bad
2.6.23-rc6-mm1: 1 out of 2 bad
switching back to 2.6.23-rc3-mm1 to rule out the hardware:
2.6.23-rc3-mm1: 6x good
The error messages from the failed 2.6.23-rc6-mm1:

Any more infos needed?
