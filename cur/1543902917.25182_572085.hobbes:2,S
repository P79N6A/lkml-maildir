You mangled the quoting of this patch: the deltas above are actually in 
drivers/acpi/numa.c and not arch/x86_64/mm/srat.c.
The placement of __cpuinitdata as shown above is permitted by gcc for a 
section attribute.  I've been corrected by akpm before when I've written 
function declarations such as "static __init int foo()" in preference of 
using the attribute syntax following all type qualifiers, but it is also 
proper syntax.  It's simply a matter of coding style, the semantics of the 
construct are identical.
