So, it's the same thing as in year 2006.  Good intentions, unexpected
side effects, and a long discussion.

It taints the kernel, but not the module.  I could add tainting the
module to the ndiswrapper code, but it would reply on the internals of
the "struct module".  And I think we really don't want modules tainting
and untainting themselves by changing THIS_MODULE->taints.  It's a
Pandora's box that's better kept closed.
