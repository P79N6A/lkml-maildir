Maybe modules' dlopen() like facility would be better to handle static
firmware or any other on-demand static data like ID tables etc.?
I.e. some additional flag for an exported symbol (in a module), that
this symbol maybe dynamically requested and used. As far as i can see,
depmod generates static map, unresolved symbols must be in the kernel
(System.map).
It will solve problem of having multiple unneeded firmware images if
driver handles many devices and firmware is allowed to be in the
kernel. No need in additional secure infrastructure.
p.s. LKML, mit-devel added. Maybe this can be done easily and somebody
     knows that.
