This is the whole reason Linux 2.4 uses devfs (device filesystem) -
there is no need to use device numbers; you just register the name in
the /dev/whatever namespace and it's done. (The kernel will assign a
unique old-style 16-bit number for compatibility purposes as needed.)
See linux/Documentation/filesystems/devfs/README for the full story.
