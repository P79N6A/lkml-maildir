You may be interested in a project we have which ported a subset of the
Berkeley Database (BDB) to the Linux kernel.  BDB is much smaller than other
SQL-based DBMSs, and is thus a lot more suitable for embedding into kernels.
We called our port KBDB.  We built a simple transactional f/s on top of it,
called kbdbfs.  We also had a short project called EAFS, which is a
stackable f/s that adds EA/ACL support to any f/s it's layered on top of.
Recently we also implemented a full-blown transactional f/s using ptrace
methods.  You can find links to these projects, and in some cases papers and
software:
