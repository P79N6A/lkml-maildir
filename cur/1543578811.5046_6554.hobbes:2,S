It wasnt so easy to trigger.. but it did.

IMHO it would be better to report the values as they arrive, and to document
this somewhere... this would make us + sys + id = 100, which is far more
coherent than the other choices (as-is, and 0).
On the other hand, reporting 0 and adding an option to make it show the real
value could avoid some bug reports like mine.
As you stated before, this values aren't so important.

I posted it to lkml
