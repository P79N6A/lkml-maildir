No, it is NOT already done.
As you yourself admit, it has no acceleration, and as such it is pretty
useless for people who really care. 
There really shouldn't be anything like XF86_FBDev - that's just pointless
exactly because it doesn't do acceleration. There should be a generic
option in the video setup section that just tells all the normal X servers
that they shouldn't worry about setting up the mode, because it has
already been done for them. That way people with a Matrox board just use
the Matrox X server, and they get full advantage of the board they have. 
XF86_FBDev is something that should be considered at most to be a "least
common denominator" kind of thing, the way XF86_VGA16 is for people who
have cards that don't have any real server for them. It should be
recognized as being just a stopgap measure for when there isn't a native
driver available.
