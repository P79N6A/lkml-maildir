Was just one command name printed, or multiple commands?
The sysrq handlers are protected by a spinlock.
If multiple command names were printed it means that the sysrq handlers
themself returned, and that printk works.
I bet that the console loglevel got corrupted.
The sysrq handler should run with forced loglevel 7, like the print of
the command name.
Did you try SysRQ+7?
