Complexity.  I've started to review the patches, and they are just too
damn complex.
For example introducing the backing_dev_info initializer and
destructor adds potential bugs if we miss to add them somewhere.
Now maybe this is unavoidable.  I'm just trying to look for a solution
involving less uncertanties and complexities.
My plan is to extract the minimal set of features from your patchset,
that solves the dirty balancing deadlocks and submit them as quickly
as possible.
After that we can look at trying to solve the more ambitious problem
of the slow vs. fast devices in a way that not only you can understand ;)
How's that?
