I just saw this for the first time since linux-mm was not cced. We have 
discussed a similar mechanism on linux-mm.
We already have such a functionality in the kernel its called a cpuset. A 
container could be created simply by creating a fake node that then 
allows constraining applications to this node. We already track the 
types of pages per node. The statistics you want are already existing. 
See /proc/zoneinfo and /sys/devices/system/node/node*/*.

Right thats what cpusets do and it has been working fine for years. Maybe 
Paul can help you if you find anything missing in the existing means to 
control resources.
