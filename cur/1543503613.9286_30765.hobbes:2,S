Like someone suggested, I modprobe-d it  :-(
The full dump of the .config file, dmesg output
and System.map file are attached:

By the way, after removing all the other Adaptec drivers
(now that I was certain that only the aic7xxx was needed),
I was able to see and use the disk I had out there.  It
seems another one must have decided to load, interfering
with aic7xxx.  It also did not oop when I probed it.[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
