The thing is, I agree with them (although the default intervals could
be a bit longer), but it gets confused and thinks it's been years since
last check, when it hasn't. I have my doubts that Theodore Tso's reply
is the problem here, because I didn't use to have this problem; it 
appeared relatively recently. But maybe old versions of e2fsck were
smarter...

That's doable on time you'd spend idling anyway. There are only so
many hours of the day that you can do work that demands considerable
thinking.

It isn't. There's no simple pre-existing setting to edit. And besides,
it's the wrong approach from the POV of clean consistent design. It's
the kludged worse-is-better approach that results in unusable 
clusterfucks.

I'd compile, if the thing to be compiled weren't made uncompilable.
I'd use pre-compiled shit, if it wasn't shit.

It didn't use to be hard for 1.2 or so, but it's been constantly getting
worse, along with all the bloat.

I don't know the details; all I know is that I've heard that the old
SATA drivers that appear as /dev/hd$PREDICTABLE are being obsoleted in
favour of those that appear as /dev/sd$RANDOM along with all the USB
devices and whatnot.
