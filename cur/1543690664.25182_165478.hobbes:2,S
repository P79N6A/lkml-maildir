oops.
yeah, i merged it originally against a different tree... that patch didn't 
apply against 2.4.22-ac
and i forgot to compile test it since i was too tired.
updated/fixed patch later today.

	"...A strange enigma is man!"
	"Someone calls him a soul concealed in an animal," I suggested.
	"Winwood Reade is good upon the subject," said Holmes.  "He remarked
that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he
becomes a mathematical certainty.  You can, for example, never foretell 
what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average 
number will be up to.  Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant.  
So says the statistician."
