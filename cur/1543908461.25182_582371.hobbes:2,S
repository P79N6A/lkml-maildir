It is exactly what I claimed, and what you asked proof of.

Like I explained in the original mail; no, I suspect such
a testcase will be really hard to construct, esp. as a small
testcase.  I have no reason to believe it is impossible to
do so though -- maybe someone else can write trickier code
than I can, in which case, please do so.
