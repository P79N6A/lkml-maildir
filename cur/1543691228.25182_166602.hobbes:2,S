I have a system with a 3c905b with the bootrom.  I last tested test3 on it
and it seemed to be quite slow.  I assumed it was because I was mounting /
over nfs.  Maybe it's not?
I have no other machines with this card running 2.6.  I know it's a
different driver but the 3c990 card I have works just fine on test3.
