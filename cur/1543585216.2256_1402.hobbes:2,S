No, not "my current" but "the previous stable". I say "2.2.xx" because
that is the previous stable kernel.
If you upgrade from 2.0.xx, you should read the 2.2.xx changes file.
The important thing is to avoid version number inflation. I don't
even bother reading the changes file, because I know it is bogus.
Nearly all of my old software works great with a 2.4.xx kernel.
