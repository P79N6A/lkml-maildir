You'll forgive me if I don't think that "change the contents of ramdisk"
is as easy as changing the kernel command line.
Last time I checked, to change the contents of a ramdisk image, you needed
to ungzip it, mount it, make some changes, unmount it, re-gzip it, and
re-install the thing.  Or, in the case of initramfs, you need to rebuild
the kernel image.  Compare this to changing the kernel command line from
"root=/dev/hda1" to "root=/dev/nfs ip=dhcp" in the boot loader by hitting
a few keys on the keyboard before the kernel loads, and I think you'll
start to get my point here.
