The Kconfig documentation for that driver should explain why.
usbmouse.c is for USB Boot Protocol Mice only.  Only if you understand
what this protocol is, should you use that driver.  Everyone else should
use the hid driver.

What kind of usb mouse do you have?  Is it a HID mouse?  Or some custom
protocol?
Also, this should be discussed on the linux-usb-devel mailing list,
there are more Linux usb developers there than on linux-kernel.

Ick, why?  What's wrong with the latest 2.4 or 2.6 kernel?
