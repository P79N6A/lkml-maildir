Actually - I think it should be stock.
Try cat /dev/input/mouse0 - and moving the mouse/trackpad. if this 
generates random text, then you're done.
/dev/input/mice is a fake device that globs all the mice in the system 
together.
/dev/input/mouse[n] is the nth mouse on the system.
Also - you can just go to device drivers/input - and disable the ps/2 
mouse driver.
Set up X and GPM to use /dev/input/mouse1 - if this is your USB mouse, 
and it just works.
