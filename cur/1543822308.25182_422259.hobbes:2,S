Yeah, you're absolutely right. Which is exactly why I asked what you
want to do with the OFF_SLAB case. We certainly can support both by
virtualizing kfree() and kmem_cache_free() with struct slab_operations
type of thing, but that's probably not very performant. Well, it might
be for NUMA, as virt_to_page() is so expensive.
Anyway, embedding struct kmem_cache pointer in the beginning of slab
page is doable (I have a proof-of-concept patch for that btw) but we
need to solve OFF_SLAB first.
