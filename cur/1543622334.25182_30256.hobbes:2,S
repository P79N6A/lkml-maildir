Oh, you're right. We indeed need only one.
Hmm, now hotplug changing the PCI clock would be quite a lot of fun -
all running drivers will need to know about the change, because some may
need to recompute the timings they have programmed into the chips ...
Because virtually disconnecting and reconnecting all the cards for which
the timings have changed will probably not be an option.
