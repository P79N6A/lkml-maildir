Yeah I will do that.
Thanks for taking a look. One thing I am thinking about is to get
rid of the unmap_underlying_metadata calls from the generic code.
I found they were required for minix to prevent corruption, however
I don't know exactly what metadata is interfering here (maybe it
is indirect blocks or something?). Anyway, I think I will make it
a requirement that the filesystem has to already handle this before
returning a newly allocated block -- they can probably do it more
efficiently and we avoid the extra work on every block allocation.

Yeah, I didn't know how much effort to put in here because I don't
know whether modern filesystems are going to need to implement their
own management of this stuff or not.
I haven't actually instrumented this in something like ext2 to see
how much IO comes from the assoc buffers...

I was actually thinking about a radix-tree :) One annoyance is that
unsigned long != sector_t :P rbtree would probably be OK.
