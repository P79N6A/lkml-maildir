hello,
i have some trouble with cdrecord, but no idea where to search or where
to ask - i hope this is the right place.
mounting the cd or play audio tracks work just fine, but if i start to
use cdrecord i got this [1] messages on the screen and in the dmesg. the 
first time i've seen the problem was with 2.6.8 and now i work with 
2.6.9-rc1 - i thought this could be a known and fixed problem, but i
have the same problem.
tomorrow i will try it with an older kernel (maybe 2.6.2). if you have
any other idea how to find this problem, please send me an e-mail
thanks,
patrick
