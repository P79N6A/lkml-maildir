Joe,
	I've attatched a small patch with some *small* changes, and the 
addition of a whole lotta comments.  I'd like to see what you think.
Changes:
1) Added a missing '"' in the comment for the bitmap_parse function
2) Renamed 'oc' to 'old_c' for readability
3) Remove "totaldigits == 0" check at the end of bitmap_parse.  I 
believe this check is redundant.  The only way that totaldigits could be 
0 at the end of the function is if ndigits is also 0 (because they're 
both incremented at the same time), and this condition is already 
checked for at the end of each chunk parsed.  Is this correct?
Additions:
4) A whole bunch of comments.  Are these all correct?
None of the things in my patch (with the possible exception of #3) 
change the functionality of the code, which looks great.
Andrew, I agree with Paul's "thumbs-up" of Joe's patch.  My patch is 
solely meant to increase the readability of the bitmap_parse function.
Cheers!
-Matt
