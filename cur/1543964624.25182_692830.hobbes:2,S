Not just long latency.  If you have a low latency link which is very
busy, perhaps a client doing lots of requests, or doing other things,
that pushes up the _effective_ latency.

I think that's a fine choice, but it doesn't solve difficult
problems.  You still have to implement the server cloud. :-)
It's possible that implementing server cloud protocol _and_ simple
client protocol may be more work than just server cloud protocol.  I'm
not sure.  Thoughts welcome.
