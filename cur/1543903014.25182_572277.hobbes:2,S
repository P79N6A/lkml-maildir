Right, gpart should be the way to go. I used that several times and
it always worked great. You'll probably loose the first partition at
first (it searches for filesystem signatures and may fail to find the
first partition's filesystem), but it should find all the rest.
Once you've written the guessed partition table, just use cfdisk (or
any other fdisk you're comfy with) to create a maximum-sized partition
in the first free area. Depending on the filesystem used there, you
may even be able to get back the remaining data.
