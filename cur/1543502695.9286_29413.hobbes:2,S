But there are applications that could share an almost as good solution in the 
kernel if it was available. This has been the traditional trade off in comp
sci for years. Save your time/money using a generic solution or achieve a
performance benefit by using a custom solution. 
Just because for your application you are willing to spend the extra time 
don't assume everyone else will for all other applications.
