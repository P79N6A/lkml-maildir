The only thing that sucks about this is when you have adapters with
the exact same chips on them on both PCI and SBUS and you would like
to write a generic driver which determines at runtime what type of bus
it is on. Having to recompile the same code with new macros one for
sbus and one for pci is evil as well.
Not sure what the pretty solution is though.
