OK, how about I change it to 9 just to show that it's arbitrary? As long
as it's 2 times smaller than 26, there should be no problem, I think.
I don't want to resend for such a small issue, so I'll wait until
it turns around and change it.
I am going to remove it completely when I revisit the naming and 26
devices limitation.
