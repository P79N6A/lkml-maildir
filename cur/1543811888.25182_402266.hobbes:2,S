Ok.  I think I have found the big bug in my task_ref patches.
I had missed that __unhash_process got moved outside of the
tasklist_lock.  Which messed up my serialization with detach_pid.
My gut feel says modifying doubly linked lists without a lock isn't 
even safe.  Which is probably why I never considered the possibility.
Now to think through what this means in terms of locking.
