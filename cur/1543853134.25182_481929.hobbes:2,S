I don't know if it's related, but i played with a few fs'es a few months ago
and both xfs and reiser4 were very slow. iirc, they both took about 45min
longer than reiserfs and jfs to copy 70 or 80gigs of files from another
drive.
I suspected delayed allocation was the culprit (both r4 and xfs use DA).
Never really looked into it much, however.
