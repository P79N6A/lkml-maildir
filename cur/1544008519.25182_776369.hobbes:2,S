Good question - not working that high up the stack I don't know the right
answer there.

Not sure. I thought the same way.

You can get them on partial writes to large sector devices, assorted
errors on SSD devices and various 'catastrophic' errors.

At the low level we have to return an error so that RAID and the like can
work.
