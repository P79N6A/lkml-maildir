No, look at the definition in include/linux/init.h:
<--  snip  -->
...
/* Functions marked as __devexit may be discarded at kernel link time, depending
   on config options.  Newer versions of binutils detect references from
   retained sections to discarded sections and flag an error.  Pointers to
   __devexit functions must use __devexit_p(function_name), the wrapper will
   insert either the function_name or NULL, depending on the config options.
 */
#if defined(MODULE) || defined(CONFIG_HOTPLUG)
#define __devexit_p(x) x
#else
#define __devexit_p(x) NULL
#endif
...
<--  snip  -->
A bit more of explanation is in Documentation/pci.txt.

time explaining its a free country because its a police state.
