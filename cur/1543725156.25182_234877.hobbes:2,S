I agree in principle, but I'm also open to the possibility of a very
faint afterimage.
I see two possibilities to "turn off the back light":
1) Push the tiny sensor next to the hinge over the "access ibm" button
manually. This cuts power to the backlight (assuming you did not associate
suspend or anything to the ensuing "LID" acpi event). I can still see the
screen rather clearly, just without the backlight. Its easy to read text
even in a moderately lit room.
2) use "radeontool light off". This cuts power to the backlight
and the lcd. I cannot see the slightest thing on the display, it goes
completely black as if the computer were switched off.
John, could you please comment on what you see during ACPI S3?
Best,
Volker
