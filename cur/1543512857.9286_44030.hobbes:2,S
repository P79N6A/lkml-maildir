Jones D ISaCS had the wisdom to write:

Yes, and then the kernel has the opportunity to "fake" (read: handle) 
the instruction on you.
So the REALLY cool thing would be to have a proc-option that allows you
to SET your serial for the userspace apps..... (using this construct, it is
even possible to provide this without having an PIII)...
