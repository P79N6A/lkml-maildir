yes I've read your "Sick Security Ideas" at

 .
It sounds like some of them are very draconian indeed.

I think that the content of the files /etc/passwd etc are beyond the scope
of the kernel. To the kernel /etc/passwd is just another file. Now to libc
and several root running programs that may or may not be the story.
You are going to hate what I say next-->
If you need some program to give special controled and logged access to
/etc/passwd and friends then you need to mark those binaries as special
cap-enhanced and then you need to excercise your policy there.
Maybe as part of that policy you augment it with CAP_LINUX_USR0 ...
CAP_LINUX_USR9 which the kernel could give a sh*t less about. Then you
could define them as you like. Then you running program could do a few
checks like is your uid on a list of good people and CAP_LINUX_USR3 is in
the current pP. I think ID is more important to such a system anyway.
You could set it up so that like group leaders can add and delete users
from their groups but only people in their groups. uid would be the main
control feature. Anyway this is beyond the scope of the kernel it should
exist purely in user-land.

Then don't give them quasi-bits. I'd think that your auditing would record
the who and what; it should also probably make some decisions based on
that-- like do nothing he smells funny. caps should specify what a given
program can do with the kernel not what a given user can do with specific
contents of specific files.

Maybe the draft was done badly-- it died did it not;->
Well obviously both of us seem to not take it super-religiously.

I think you read too many extremes into it. CAP_LINUX_ADDUSER_2_ETC_PASSWD
was never intended. I think the side-effect we are fighting over was never
intended-- I do concede that I could be wrong about that.

Then processes can't control its inheritence on a per process basis.
expanding our formulas and the drafts you get
pP'= (fP & x) | (fI & pI) | (pP & pI & fI & pP_control_conf)
then we get to the rediculas situation where a process is allowing
inheritence, file is aggreeing, and the parent already has the power so
why should it not pass the power.
so killing the extra term we get:
pP'= (fP & x) | (fI & pI) | (pP & pI & fI )
which again is absurd and should be reduced to one of two ways
pP'= (fP & x) | (pP & pI & fI )
pP'= (fP & x) | (fI & pI)
x is allowed to be implementation defined.
Don't these formulas look familiar?

again that old_pm term should be constrained by its pP and the inheritence
flags. Go through the above absurdity reductions and see if you don't
again get very familiar formulas.

Pluralities above necessities.

good he isn't permitted to do anything, he has to get his power through
well controlled binaries, let the power reside with the binaries -- not
the luser then. Those special binaries are going to have to be carefuly
written anyway.

Yes it should. The important contrast is that under my new formulas they
can all be safely set. Under your system you propose that they can grant
powers under various situations.

If you don't want the admins shell to have the power, then don't empower
them plain and simple. Empower the binaries and then be super careful what
you do in them. capibilities grant raw powers, your binaries should
enforce policies.

Do not like 1. .. they'd have less power so number 2. would be less of a
hole and with a little smarting up could be greatly improved.
Smart programs can influence pI quite effectively as they need to.
Dumb ones should be rewritten over time. In the mean while they may leak
but at least they'd be leaking consideribly less. 
> Considering option 3, one could have this:

Smart programs can already influence pI in quite a fine-grained manner.
If dumb ones are leaking(should be less then all caps) then you at least
happen to have the oppurtunity to correct that.
Plus you do not really mean that you should use your formula number 3.
As it seems to only increase pI, exactly opposite of what I think you
intended.

then your shell has no power, but every joe schmoe binary gets the
privledges you clearly wanted to protect so dearly. Blech ugly thats why I
want to add in the pP term so that children can't willy nilly inherite
weird stuff that the parents didn't have. I want fI to be purely
restrictive, you want it to be some mix of restrictive/enabling. We
already have an enabler in fP and I think it is sufficient.
The mixed quasi capibilities make me quesy.

I think that should be pP and I think that you should be able to easily
lose them when you call children through inheritence masking. I really
dislike the words "always added". I like those defaults and think can make
them safe by adding in a extra term so that children gain privledges only
through a well understand single mechanism.

That sounds good;-> stupid question on my part.

unmarked ones I think should get fI=pP, fP=0, fE=pP'
marked but untrusted ones should be whatever they care to be however the x
in the draft stand should be set to zero effectively ignoring fP;->

Kludge upon Kludge for dubious benefite. Doesn't the varible explosion

Yes used sparingly it is good. I think that EPERMing `foo --version` is a
little harse though.
Anyway I am really enjoying all this discussion.
