New file labels based on path should not be addressed in the kernel and 
LD_PRELOAD would be incredibly hacky. Our solution to the problem is 
restorecond (
http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/4368.html
) which addresses 
users who want to be able to mkdir public_html and immediately use it. 
Userland solutions like this will make SELinux easier and easier to use, 
and they already have. Anyone not keeping up with SELinux lately a 
tremendous amount has been done in the area of usability as outlined at 
this years selinux symposium 
(
http://selinux-symposium.org/2006/slides/01-smalley-yir.pdf
).
