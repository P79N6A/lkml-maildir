Yes and no.  At one point I was working with Erich moving his NUMA 
scheduler to 2.5 and testing it on our NUMA hardware.  However, it
was not looking like his NUMA scheduler was going to be ready for 
2.5, so I went off on a separate effort to produce a much smaller,
simpler patch to provide rudimentary NUMA support within the scheduler.
This patch does not have all the functionality of Erich's, but does
provide definite performance improvements on NUMA machines with no
degradation on non-NUMA SMP.  It is much smaller and less intrusive,
and has been tested on multiple NUMA architectures (including by 
Erich on the NEC IA64 NUMA box).
The 2.5 status list has not been updated to reflect this separate 
effort, and I believe incorrectly lists this entry as "ready".  There
really are now two NUMA scheduler projects:
* Simple NUMA scheduler (Michael Hohnbaum)  - ready for inclusion
* Node affine NUMA scheduler (Erich Focht)  - Alpha (Beta?)
