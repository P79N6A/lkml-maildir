Actually MTRRs take care of that on x86.
So essentially on x86 ioremap() for devices is already ioremap_uncached()
And ioremap on memory is cached.
That's nice and simple semantics that other platforms can emulate too.
Doing things differently will just cause pain for the other platforms
when they have to fix up drivers all the time.
It all works fine until someone wants WC too. I would rather add a 
ioremap_wc(), that would be more useful.
