We've had this before, and it breaks some code that removes items from
lists as follows,
    list_for_each(p, list)
	if (condition)
	    list_del(p);
These would have to either use __list_del, or need to do,
    for(p = list.next; p != &list;) {
	struct list_head *n = p->next;
	if (condition)
	    list_del(p);
	p = n;
    }
I'm not sure how many places are using the list_for_each/list_del
construction, but there were a couple when this was in the tree
previously. Converting most places that use list_del to use
list_del_init should fix the same bugs, but not cause problems for
existing code.
Just did a grep for list_del and didn't find any obvious places where we
are doing the above construction, except for drivers/isdn/capi/capilib.c
and maybe drivers/hotplug/pcihp_skeleton.c, but it could be hidden in
many more places by a macro or function call (or a larger loop than my 3
line context was showing). But there are not that many places where
we're calling list_del while not immediately re-initializing or adding
the unlinked list_head to another list.
You could probably also add list_move
    list_move(entry, head)
    {
	if (!list_empty(entry))
	    __list_del(entry->prev, entry->next);
	list_add(entry, head);
    }
And just delete list_del completely, because all existing places where
list_del is currently used should probably use either list_del_init, or
list_move.
