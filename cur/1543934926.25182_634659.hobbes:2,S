We are not talking about Aunt Tillie [1] since she anyway does not build 
her own kernel.
The vast majority of kconfig users should be covered by the
"system administrator" use case. And for them it's a lot easier if they 
simply find the options for their hardware in the logical places without 
additional hassle.
Whether or not an option requires an additional subsystem like e.g. SCSI 
or SSB are hardware and implementation details we shouldn't bother 
kconfig users with.
