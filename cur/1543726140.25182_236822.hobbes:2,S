I was having mobo problems back about rc1 times, so I'm not able to 
positively say that rc1 did/did not do it.  I tried to make that 
clear in a later message but must not have been.  Motherboard, cpu, 
memory and psu are all fresh now.
As this mobo contains the nforce2 chipset, now running the reverse 
engineered driver, how far back can I go without running into 
problems with it?
