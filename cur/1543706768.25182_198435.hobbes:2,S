If the mouse gets into confusing state, I can "replug" it into the KVM 
switch (while in Windows) and it works fine after that. I have also 
noticed that when Windows is doing "resume" I must not switch away 
before it is if I want my mouse to work (otherwise I will need to replug).
For Linux, I also need to switch from X to console and back when the 
mouse is "confused".
With 2.4 I repeat the the 2 steps described above my mouse works (incl 
wheel) on both machines after that.

I guess I need to figure out how to force both machines to initialize 
the mouse in the same way then...
