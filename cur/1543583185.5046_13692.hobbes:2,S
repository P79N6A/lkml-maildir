I believe CLOCAL only governs how DCD is used (or ignored) when opening
a port (must be active to complete open) and maintaining a connection
(negation signals hangup).
So CLOCAL controls the driver's 'interpretation' of DCD but
TIOCMIWAIT monitors the signal transitions without regard to
a predefined interpretation (let's the application decide what
to do with DCD).
