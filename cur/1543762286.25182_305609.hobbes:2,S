Clean umount, not unclean.  Not even removing the device, no shutdown.
I'm not damaging the filesystem except by actually using it.
It's remniscent of using NTFS with "full read-write" under Linux, where
you have lots of damage afterwards even though you didn't do anything
nasty to damage it.

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
    wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
