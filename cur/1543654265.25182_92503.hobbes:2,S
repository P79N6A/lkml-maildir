I can't get modutils to work with the 2.5.48/49 kernel.
I get an error about QM_MODULES not being supported.
I've tried many versions of modutils all with the same problem... Do i
need a patch or some magic stuff needs to be passed to the configure
script?
Or do I just need to build everything into the kernel?
I don't care about backward compadibility with 2.4.x...
