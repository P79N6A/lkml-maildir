2.2.6 didn't swap that much (128M machine).  2.2.9 swaps a lot more. 
Shortly after boot I started a kernel compile and vmstat reported smpd
went from 0 to 11000 in one go.  Right now it's about 16000, and switching
desktops just now caused ~200 to swap in, which makes it noticable.  2.2.6
never did that.  I had 2.2.6 running for about 3 weeks and swpd never went
over 2000.
2.2.9 made it through the whole kernel compile with buff never going above
10000.  That's different too.
Also, if I kill update it doesn't sync (e.g. I can copy whole directory
trees around and wait multiple minutes and never see ANY disk activity
until I do a "sync" manually).  Is that feature in or out in 2.2.9?
