  I suppose Alan is going to pass the patch to Linus eventually.  I think
there is actually a number of people interested in the fix, so I may pass
it to Linus independently, but I'm really time-constrained these days, so
it might not happen before 2.4.3 (I don't feel safe about submitting a
patch without actually run-time testing it against whatever test kernel is
current at the moment).
