Hi Everyone,
Sorry to bring this up again, but I think that the current behavior of requiring a manual device reset, for some disks that are put to sleep with hdparm -Y is definitely wrong - I mailed Mark Lord, (the hdparm maintainer) who said:

Is this a known issue with some interface/drive combinations?  I can only reproduce it with a Maxtor disk on a PIIX3 interface.  After being put to sleep, the disk never responds until it is manually reset with hdparm -w.
I know you can achieve a similar effect by putting the disk in to standby, but putting it to sleep will reduce energy consumption, (by a tiny amount).
John.
