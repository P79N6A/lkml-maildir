I'm not aware of any code in the tree triggering it.  We copied some of the
uaccess.h macro guts into macros used in systemtap, and there we hit an
instance of someone producing code that used a large constant and hit the
problem.  Since I noticed the kernel code still had the same bug, I was
just being proactive in propagating the fix back.
Thanks,
Roland
