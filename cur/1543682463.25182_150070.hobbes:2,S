The whole blowup over RMS requesting the GNU/Linux tag is that a lot
of folks think he's talking about the kernel, and not Linux
distributions.
Even many folks "in the know" seem to miss this distinction: RMS
hasn't ever asked that the kernel be called GNU/Linux. He asks that
"Linux distributions," which are called "Linux" by the public at
large, carry the extra tag.
