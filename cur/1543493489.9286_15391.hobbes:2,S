Yes it does. And, in fact, a simple real-mode DOS ISR which uses the same
hardware (as stated) runs approximately 10 times faster. I get damn tired
of having everybody and their brother "explain" that I don't know what
I'm doing. I presented true, factual, information. It was not a complaint.
It was just fact. Take it or leave it.
