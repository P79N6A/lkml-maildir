I will _refuse_ to have a kernel suspend that synchronizes the raid etc.
That would make suspend/resume potentially take a _loong_ time.
If you want to synchronize your raid thing, make the user-level thing that
triggers the suspend do it. Same goes for things like "sync network
filesystems" etc. This is not a kernel level issue, and the kernel
shouldn't even try to do it.
If somebody has pending stuff over NFS and suspends, and when it comes
back it's not on the network any more, that is 100% equivalent to removing
a PCMCIA network card while running. It's supposed to work - but if you
lose data that's YOUR problem, not the kernels.
