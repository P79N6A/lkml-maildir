Hi,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of curiosity, which version of gcc/egcs
are you using to build with this patch?&nbsp; I get the following with
stock RH6.0 egcs/1.1.2:
<p>......
<p><tt>make -C&nbsp; arch/alpha/kernel</tt>
<br><tt>make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/kernel'</tt>
<br><tt>gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -D__SMP__ -pipe -mno-fp-regs
-ffixed-8&nbsp;&nbsp; -c -o smp.o smp.c</tt>
<br><tt>smp.c:48: section attribute not allowed for `bits'</tt>
<br><tt>make[1]: *** [smp.o] Error 1</tt>
<br><tt>make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/kernel'</tt>
<br><tt>make: *** [_dir_arch/alpha/kernel] Error 2</tt>
<p>My only guess so far is that it's complaining about the __cacheline_aligned
statement.&nbsp; As always, building for a rawhide, SMP, etc.&nbsp; Thoughts?

<p>Matti reported problems with __kernel_thread missing at link.
<br>Dunno what was up with that, but I moved kernel_thread into
