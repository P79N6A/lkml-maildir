yeah. This code predates the generic-atomic-cmpxchg code. (Feel free to 
review all __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG users after this goes in, and remove 
__HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG altogether with a CONFIG_ flag.)
but ... the spinlock based variant is quite likely faster (on i386) than 
generic-cmpxchg. Couldnt we introduce a new API, something along the 
lines of:
	atomic_cmpxchg_lock(&count, &lock->wait_lock);
and if the cmpxchg fails, it would hold the spinlock? The cmpxchg 
semantics could be guaranteed by the spinlock. (because it is 'global' 
for that particular critical section)
