The patch has some strange non-ascii chars there:
- the first hunk changes a don't to a don't (an apostrophe to a non-ascii
  acute accent...)
- A für to a fÃ¼r (I see the current fine on a terminal but not the second)
- Some copyright symbols...
See the 1st, 3rd and 4th hunks in the changes to Configure.help.
