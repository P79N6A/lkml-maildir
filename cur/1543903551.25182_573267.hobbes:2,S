I think it should remain the low point.

Only if you assume that max request size is always a power of 2. That's
usually true, but there are cases where it's 124kb for instance.
And there's still an issue when max_sectors isn't the deciding factor,
if we end up having to stop merging on a request because we hit other
limitations.
So there's definitely room for improvement! Even today, btw, it's not
all because of these changes.
