I disagree. Mice and keyboards are becoming more complex. To the point
where the hardware state has to be managed between processes in a
possible SMP system. Consider mice with force feedback. If several process
program the mouse to vibrate at the smae time it sums all the values up.
You can end up breaking the mouse because it vibrated to hard. Also look
at the problems GPM and X have had before. This problem gets more complex
as more pieces of software that play around with mice and keyboards 
emerges besides X or even while running in X.
