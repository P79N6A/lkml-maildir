Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Sorry if someone has already posted this or fixed this.  This seems to
have been added in 2.3.18ac9.  In net/Config.in, in a section for the
Acorn Econet/AUN protocols (EXPERIMENTAL), the following code has a
missing then error:
(Lines 69-71)
   if [ "$CONFIG_INET" = "y" ];
      tristate 'Acorn Econet/AUN protocols (EXPERIMENTAL)' CONFIG_ECONET
   fi
Needs to be:
   if [ "$CONFIG_INET" = "y" ]; then
      tristate 'Acorn Econet/AUN protocols (EXPERIMENTAL)' CONFIG_ECONET
   fi
Without the "then" statement, if you go to make menuconfig, and go to
"Networking Options" it fails with this error:
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu9: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
