Here is a fix for synaptics touchpads with "multi buttons". The patch
comes from Hartwig Felger, who wrote the original multi button support
patch (p00003_synaptics-multi-button.patch). The same bug fix has been
included in the XFree86 driver for a few weeks, and seems to work
fine. (That part of the X driver is only used for 2.4 kernels.)
