Subject: [PATCH 4/9] readahead: quick startup on sequential mmap readahead
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/16/50

When the user explicitly sets MADV_SEQUENTIAL, we should really avoid the slow
readahead size ramp-up phase and start full-size readahead immediately.
This patch won't change behavior for the auto-detected sequential mmap reads.
Its previous read-around size is ra_pages/2, so it will be doubled to the full
readahead size anyway.
