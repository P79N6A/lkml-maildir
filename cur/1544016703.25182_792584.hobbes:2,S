Yeah, I don't think we can do much better than those ops.  I have two
issues tho.
1. percpu_and() is missing.  I added it for completeness's sake.
2. The generic percpu_op() should be local to the cpu, so it should
   expand to...
   do { get_cpu_var(var) OP (val); put_cpu_var(var) } while (0)
   as the original x86_OP_percpu() did.  Right?
Thanks.
