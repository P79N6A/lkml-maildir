Journaling will not do anything good in such case, as damaged kernel
could write damaged data to your harddisk. You should run full fsck
after every such lockup even if you are using journaled filesystem -
- unless you are 100% sure that kernel really stoped doing anything
instead of that it started doing strange things.

As there are no loops in vmmon, it is mathematically provable that it
did not end in endless loop with interrupts disabled inside vmmon ;-) 
But it could die anywhere else. 
Probably it is time for me to try Linus's kernel, but I have so perfect 
exprience with Alan ones that I'm a bit reluctant to do that.
