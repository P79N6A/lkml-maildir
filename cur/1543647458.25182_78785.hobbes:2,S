I have been able to tune bdflush in 2.4-aa kernels to be much more
aggressive about moving data to disk under write pressure, and that has
been a big plus in terms of both getting the write completed in less real
time and fewer big pauses doing trivial things like uncovering a window. I
see less swap used.

I'm going to try this patch, but building a kernel on my standard test
machine is painfully slow, so it will come after 41-ac2. It appears to
address the balance issue dynamically.

I actually like the idea of writer throttling, I just wonder how it will
work at the corner cases like only one big writer (mkisofs) or the
alternative, lots of little writers.
