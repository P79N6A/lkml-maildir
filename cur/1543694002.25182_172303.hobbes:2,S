AFAICS you're missing some code that could be a major data corrupter:
FLUSH CACHE [EXT] may return before it's complete.  You need to create
an issue loop, that does FLUSH CACHE [EXT] and reads the result.  If the
result indicates the flush cache was partial, then you need to re-issue
the flush.  Lather, rinse, repeat until flush cache indicates all data
is really flushed.
