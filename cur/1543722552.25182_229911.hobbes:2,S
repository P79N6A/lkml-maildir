Ok...  But the code is still calling flush_tlb_mm() from within
set_cpus_allowed() on non-ia64 platforms, which I believe is unnecessary.
And it's calling it with a null pointer for kernel threads, which oopses on
i386.  We went over this weeks ago.
Shouldn't asm-generic.h be doing
	#define tlb_migrate_finish(mm)	do {} while (0)
?
