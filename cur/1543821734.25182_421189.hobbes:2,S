This is a known problem with the old IDE layer. There are several
problems involved
1. The old IDE layer reset confuses some drives fatally
2. The DMA recovery tricks it does break the state machine of some
controllers and hang them for good
3. The error recovery and timer code races and can hang
4. The speed change paths used on DMA fail change down race everything

Please try the libata PATA patches instead of the old IDE layer.
