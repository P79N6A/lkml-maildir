Subject: 2.2.* kernels w/ glibc-2.1.* allowing ngroups_max to be > 128?

I just found out today that SUN/Solaris cannot handle more than 32
groups/user.
I have a need to have certain users in more than 128 groups (preferred 256
or more).
I am hoping that someone here could answer these questions (and maybe get a
Linux
system into a SUN shop.  ;) )
1)  Can Linux 2.2.* / glibc 2.1.* handle > 128 groups per user?
1a)    What files need to be modified to do this?
1b)   Does glibc-2.1.* take this information dynamically from the kernel
header files?
2) What are the maximum sizes of the /etc/groups file.
2a)  Maximum line size (1024?)
2b) Maximum number of groups
2c) Maximum number of bytes for the file itself
3) What are the maximum sizes of the /etc/passwd & /etc/shadow files?
3a) Maximum number of users
3b) maximum size of these files?
If anyone can answer this or point me to the answers I'd greatly appreciate
it.
My back is up against a wall with Solaris/SUN and need to get a solution
that
will work in place ASAP.   Oh, I know that NFS will break with > 16 groups
but that is not important (this server will not be exporting NFS
filesystems).
Thanks.
