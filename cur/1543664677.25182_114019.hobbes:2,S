Larry did a pretty good job of determining what the software needed to do to
be useful for the linux-kernel project.  Any possible replacement that doesn't
do at least what bitkeeper does is likely dead before it starts.
(nevermind that no replacement is necessary, due to Larry's gratis provision
of the tool to kernel developers...)
