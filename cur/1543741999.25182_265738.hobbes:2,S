I was thinking the bte would be best used in an async mode where the pages
would be pre-zeroed and available for use if the application needs them.
If the pre-zeroed list is empty, then use the cpu to zero the page.

The processor is slightly faster.  I believe the FSB is 200Mhz and the
II is 100Mhz (150Mhz with no attached IX brick).  Future versions of the
BTE will possibly have faster access to on node memory than the processor.

I am not either.  I just would like to see any design take into consideration
the possible uses and not design them out.  Nothing more.

Plus, a single CPU could schedule the clearing of pages on multiple
nodes at the same time.  Imagine a system that has 256 compute nodes
and 756 memory nodes.  That configuration is theoretically possible with
todays hardware, but we have never built or sold one.  Looking at that
configuration gives you an one possible indication of how a pre-zeroing
mechanism might improve things.
I am not saying that the BTE is the best option, or even a good one.  It
just looks interesting.  It does bring up some interesting problems with
repeatability.  Consider the application startup following termination
of another which used all the huge pages.  The pre-zeroed list will
be nearly if not completely empty.  The first fault will find the list
empty and have to zero the page itself.  Hopefully, the second fault will
find one on the zeroed list and return immediately.  This would cause
application startup time to feel like it doubled from the previous run.
Ouch.  That would be very upsetting for our typical customers.
The more memory nodes you have per cpu, the better this number will
appear.
Sorry for being spineless, but I don't feel very strongly that it will
be beneficial enough to be desirable.  I am just not sure.  I would
just hope that it is taken into consideration during the design and,
as long as it has no negative impact on the design, be left as a
possibility.
Thanks,
