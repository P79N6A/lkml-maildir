So are driver writers supposed to start accepting patches to
free/request irqs? in a sense of making it all go forward so at some
point we can switch over to doing the correct thing? but my patch for
yenta breaks setups for some strange reason..... (maybe just APM
ones..)
If so we should put the patch to break links into -mm and then start
fixing up drivers...
