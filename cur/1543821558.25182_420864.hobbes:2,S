Yeah, what was I thinking.  So use some platform hook instead.
But Arnd of course is right; if the driver (currently) only works
on a certain platform, just mark it as such in the Makefile (erm,
Kconfig file).
Hey, we should probably do that with 90% of all drivers.  But that
is a discussion for some other day :-)
