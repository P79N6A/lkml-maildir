Hi,
   I was just lent a QLogic ISP2200 FC adapter and have been having a 
bear of a time trying to get it to work on my Alpha ES40 and GS80.  I've 
tried both the qlogicfc (with standard kernel) and qla2x00 (from QLogic 
and Compaq) driver both built-in and as modules but neither of them are 
working.  Has anyone had success with later (I'm using 2.4.0-test11) 2.4 
kernels and the QLogic FC adapter?  I'm currently plugged into a Brocade 
switch (Plaides I, I believe) which is also attached to two pair of 
HSG80 FC RAID controllers.  AFAIK, the 2200 is supposed to work with an 
FC fabric, so this should work, right?  Can anyone offer any 
assistance?  Thanks!
  - Pete
