Thanks. Please CC me in general on these patches :-)
I was planning to also discuss ordering of module aliases entries, since
we can have several modules providing the same modalias (this gets even
worse on "Enterprise Linux" distributions, where we might have third
party modules providing additional aliases). I guess this ordering is
probably better than just a numeric sort, which was the original idea.
Jon.
