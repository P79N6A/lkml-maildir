Something seems to have changed, most all my threaded programs that I use
now act strangely.  Pan seems oblivious to net commands, xmms won't play,
host just stalls, the list goes on.
They all appear to be disconnected from themselves, they hang/stall, and
when you kill them you must kill -9, term doesn't accomplish anything, and
they become zombies and won't go away until you reboot.
I haven't modified libc/linuxthreads, the only thing that has changed is
the kernel.  So I'm laying my odds there :)
