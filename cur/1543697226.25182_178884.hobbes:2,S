That's quite the patch cocktail, perhaps they need some auditing on stack 
usage.

Yes that patch was 2.5/6 specific.

The i386 stack grows downwards, so if anything it'll report even earlier 
than what you're hitting now. I'd recommend backing out those patches one by 
one until you find out the offending patch and then perhaps do the stack 
usage audit from there.
