The above patch works fine to get back to the previous (pre-2.5.32) state.
But, it makes no sense to modify the bounce_limit based on the type of
storage that is attached to an adapter.
We want to allow high mem for block devices other than SCSI direct access
devices (TYPE_DISK), such as CD ROM (SDpnt->type TYPE_ROM), WORM devices
(TYPE_WORM), and optical disks (TYPE_MOD).
So it is better to patch scsi_initialize_merge_fn:
