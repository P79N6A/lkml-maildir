There are requests for memory-hot-add should allow to hot-add not-aligned memory.
Then, I wrote ioresouce collision check patch (before..but had bug..)
With ioresouce collistion check, alignments are not required at *add*.
(onlining is just for  *offlined section*, now)

For example, considering ia64, which has 1Gbytes section...
hot add following region.
==
(A) 0xc0000000 - 0xd7ffffff  (section 3)
(B) 0xe0000000 - 0xffffffff  (section 3)
==
(A) and (B) will go to the same section, but there is a memory hole between
(A) and (B). Considering memory (B) appears after (A) in DSDT.
After add_memory() against (A) is called, section 3 is ready.
Then, pfn_valid(0xe0000000) and pfn_valid(0xffffffff) returns true because
they are in section 3.
So, checking pfn_valid() for (B) will returns true and memory (B) cannot be
added. ioresouce collision check will help this situation.
The memory hole are not onlined because there are no ioresouce for it.
