This is a userspace-visible change, but I guess it's unavoidable.
Will anything break?
Also, I dislike this approach of duplicating the firmware device tree
path in sysfs.  Are GX/ibmebus devices guaranteed to be children of
the same node in the OF device tree?  If so, their unit addresses will
be unique, and therefore suitable values for bus_id.  I believe this
is what the powerpc vio bus code does.
