The typical use case of restrict is to tell it that multiple given
arrays are independent and then give the loop optimizer 
more freedom to handle expressions in the loop that
accesses these arrays.
Since there are no loops in the list functions nothing changed.
Ok presumably there are some other optimizations which 
rely on that alias information too, but again the list_*
stuff is probably too simple to trigger any of them.
