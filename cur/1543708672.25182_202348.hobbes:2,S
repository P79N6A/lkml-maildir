More or less.  I wonder if:
static inline long jiffies_to_clock_t(long x)
{
	u64 tmp = (u64)x * TICK_NSEC;
	div64(tmp, (NSEC_PER_SEC / USER_HZ));
	return (long)x;
}
might be better as it addresses the overflow issue.  Should be able to toss the 
#if (HZ % USER_HZ)==0 test too.  We could get carried away and do scaled math to 
eliminate the div64 but I don't think this path is used enough to justify the 
clarity ;) that would make.
