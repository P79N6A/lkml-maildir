If you want to be able to see the BIOS, you'll need some legacy emulation,
but it should be enough to implement MDA output.
Since some VGA cards used to depend on the MDA/CGA BIOS routines, most
(all?) BIOS variants will implement all nescensary IO functions. You'll
need some MDA registers for the cursor position (that don't even clash with
EGA/VGA/CGA), 4K mapped memory at B000:0000 and a loop translating the text.
