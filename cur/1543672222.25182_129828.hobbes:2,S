OK. Maybe I wasn't clear enough.
1. Partition a drive
2. Reboot
3. Now the kernel should see the partitions and let you create file
systems on them.
You rebooted and fdisk sees the partitions now. Fine. Please try to
mke2fs /dev/md0p1
That should work. If it doesn't, devfs could be the problem.
Could you please tell us which kernel version you're using?
