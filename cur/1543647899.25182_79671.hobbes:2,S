I think this is where you're going to get the most disagreement.
It was included in mainline, then it just goes away? Linus has no
obligation at all to include anything, but a lot of people depend
on it.
Yeah yeah, distros can include it at will, but mainline inclusion is the
best way to get large exposure and testing to the thing.
Having said all that, given that your premises are true regarding the
code design problems you have with EVMS, you have a valid point about
including it in mainline. The question is, is this good enough to ignore
having a logical device management system?!?
