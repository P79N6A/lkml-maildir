Given how the thread started I'm uncertain if with "stable" he meant "bug-free"
or "same API". You certainly mean "same API" and I see your point, OTOH
supporting gcc extensions still looks like the best solution to me - even if we
lack the standardization - because: 1) if you try to change the kernel I think
you'll get even more mainteinance troubles :), 2) the stable kernels never get
compiled with the bleeding edge gcc, so you would have plenty of time to
catchup any potential change in the gcc extensions.
