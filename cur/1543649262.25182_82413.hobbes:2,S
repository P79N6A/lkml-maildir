Maybe so.  If we get the infrastructure into place, we can change that 
afterwards.

What if there's an NMI from multiple things?  Not that it's likely, but 
it's possible, right?  I could easily add priority and sort the list by 
it, and add a NOTIFY_STOP_MASK, if there is some benefit.

This is an NMI, does it really matter?  And is there another way to do 
this without locks?

dev_name could be removed, although it would be nice for reporting 
later.  Basically, for the same reason it's there for interrupts.  And 
again, this is an NMI, I don't think performance really matters (unless 
we perhaps add the NMI watchdog to this).

I don't understand.  The xchg()s are for atomicity between the 
request/release code and the NMI handler.  How could the notifier code 
do it?

This is so the user code can know if it's available or not.

I'm not sure.  It looks possible, but remember, this is an NMI, normal 
rules may not apply.  Particularly, you cannot block or spin waiting for 
something else, the NMI code has to run.  An NMI can happen at ANY time. 
 If the rcu code can handle this, I could use it, but I have not looked 
to see if it can.
