Humm, I didn't make an oldconfig, but I did mess around with 
menuconfig before I built it.  Took some gingerbread out of it.  
Enough that my grub line 'vga=791' gave me a blank screen, but 
apparently did boot.  I rebooted to a different kernel, fixed that 
line in grub.conf, and I'm running on it right now.
