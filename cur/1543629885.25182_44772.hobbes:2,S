I have read through the list seeing many emails on the 3c59x module, 
however, what I found for the recent posts was for laptops.
Here is the situation
    Tyan S2466 motherboard with 3Com (3c509c) onboard nic, Intel 
eepro100 pci nic.  RedHat 7.2 XFS. When the machine boots, the intel 
card comes up fine. The 3com card appears to initialize, can be seen 
from the box itself, however cannot ping out to anything else, and 
cannot be pinged from anywhere. If I down and up the card twice, it 
comes up fine with no more worries. No errors are generated.  The same 
behavior occurs with the default 2.4.9 kernel that comes with 7.2 
install, and with the 2.4.18 kernel.
Any insights would be most appreciated.
Thanks,
B
