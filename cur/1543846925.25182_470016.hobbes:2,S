The canonical location of the "original" MAC address is where we write
back the reversed MAC address. So that won't work.

AFAIK there is no way to do that (except powering off the machine).

Nooooo! That would be a nightmare. Especially because some BIOSes
allow users to set the MAC address. All those setups would be broken
instantly by that solution. (Yes, you can probably be clever, but
then you don't have a chance to fix this generically.)
