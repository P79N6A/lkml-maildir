I'd be more inclined to register under a different
name than "tmpfs" in the !CONFIG_TMPFS case.
But as I said in my earlier reply to you (which you should have
received before you sent this?), it's been like this ever since
2.4.4 when "tmpfs" and CONFIG_TMPFS came into being, so I don't
see why we need to change it now.
The real 2.4.9 error is fixed by the patch below that I sent then:
does that solve your problems?
