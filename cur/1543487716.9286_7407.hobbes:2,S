Subject: When is it *really* neccesary to do 'make clean'

In order to save much time on compiling/recompiling kernels for a project 
I'm working on I'd like to know exactly when a 'make dep;make clean' is 
necessary vs. just a make zImage, make modules, make modules_install.
It would be nice to keep the .o files around from a previous compilation 
and just link them back in if we can.
Thanks.
