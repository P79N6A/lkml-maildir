In and of itself, that is an acceptable result.  We simply cannot take
into kernel configuration variations between two kernel builds.  If you
build your isapnp module with one configuration, and your 3c509 module
with another config, consider yourself lucky that it works at all.

I probably agree with you and Paul, but I'll have to give it a bit more
thought.  Past a certain point, bus support needs to be in its own
driver, similar to drivers/sound/{sb_card,sb_common}.c.  But in this
particular case, that would be overkill.
