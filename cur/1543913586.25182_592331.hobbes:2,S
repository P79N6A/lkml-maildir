Well, there seems to be a problem at least with .bss:
http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5006
With __attribute__((section(".bss.page_aligned")))
gcc will produce .bss.page_aligned section
with NOBITS attribute, purely on the basis
of section name starting by '.bss.'
With __attribute__((section(".bss_page_aligned"))),
section will get PROGBITS attribute instead.
Combining NOBITS and PROGBITS sections into one .bss
section is not funny.
IOW: at least for bss, we _must_ use ".bss.xxx" names.
I propose (and will implement in next round of patches)
.bss.k.page_aligned ('k' for 'kernel').
Lickily, we alctually have only one special bss section
on kernel today.
Sam, my question - should I also do the same for text/rodata/data,
just for paranoid reasons?
