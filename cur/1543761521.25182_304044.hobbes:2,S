Extract from /usr/share/doc/smartmontools/WARNINGS.gz:
SYSTEM:   Promise 20265 IDE-controller
PROBLEM:  Smartctl locks system solid when used on CDROM/DVD device
REPORTER: see link below
LINK:     
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=208964
NOTE:     Problem seems to affect kernel 2.4.21 only.
SYSTEM:   Promise IDE-controllers and perhaps others also
PROBLEM:  System freezes under heavy load, perhaps when running SMART
commands

NOTE:     Before freezing, SYSLOG shows the following message(s)
          kernel: hdf: dma timer expiry: dma status == 0xXX
          where XX is two hexidecimal digits. This may be a kernel bug
          or an underlying hardware problem.  It's not clear if
          smartmontools plays a role in provoking this problem.  FINAL
          NOTE: Problem was COMPLETELY resolved by replacing the power
          supply.  See URL above, entry on May 29, 2004 by Holbe.  Other
          things to try are exchanging cables, and cleaning PCI slots.
This sounds highly familiar and shows an at least hidden
correlation(-potential) between this kind of error and the Promise controller 
PDC drivers.
Ok, maybe I'm suffering prejudices now. We'll see.
A year ago, other disks (IBM/WD) had trouble on the PDC also, but not on onboard
controllers. And they are still spinning today. (Means, they had not to
be replaced for hard disk errors)
Fact is however, that as mailed last year, even after a complete
exchange of mainboard and processor, the problem perexists through any
kernel-version. Furthermore, countless posts indicate similar or same
symptoms.
Nevertheless, I keep the list up-to-date in case of new info.

Could you please explain what these errors mean exactly and what may
have caused them?
Might it be possible that these transmission/xxx errors be caused 
by a bad card and/or driver?
I'm asking this as the disk never showed errors on onboard IDE ports.
