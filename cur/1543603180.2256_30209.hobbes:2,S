This iss sort of funny...A number of people at the office thought SysRq
was already stateful because there are a number of keyboards that do not
send a release event when alt+sysrq+another key are pressed
simultaneously....It actually makes it look like alt-sysrq is pressed
until alt-sysrq is actually pressed again without any keys following it. 
I suppose this patch makes this cheap keyboard flaw transparent. :)
