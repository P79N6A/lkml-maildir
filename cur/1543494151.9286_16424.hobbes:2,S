  Eric,
     I have some question's. Excuse me for my ignorance.

    When a kernel mapping is created for a given user-page. Doesn't the reference
    count for the page be "2", one for the user and one for the kernel. Doesn't 
    the page structure maintain a reference count ?
    Also when a kernel mapping is created, shouldn't the page accquire a property
    of staying around, even if the user mapping goes off ? Because when the user
    process goes off the page * should * not go back to the free pool, but stay 
    around as the "ref cnt" is now "1". Also it should always stay in memory, because
    the page is still locked. If a process was the only user for the page when
    the memory cleanup occurs as part of exit(), the page will go back to the free pool
    and lose its property of being locked. 
    But i do accept one likely problem in such DMA's. In case the driver is waiting
    for the DMA to happen/complete and an un-advertised exit() happens:
    This will more likely cause kernel memory VM and the pages behind them to be eaten 
    up, as there is no one to free them if the process goes off un-advertised. This 
    is assuming that the process had called exit() in the interruptible blocking call 
    itself on receipt of say a SIGSEGV ( for a multi-threaded case ), or some other
    fatal exit criteria.
    I have another question:
     Doesn't the above happen for the case for allocation of kernel buffers and mmap
     to the user ? I mean who will free the kernel buffers in this case ?
 thanks,
 Rama.
