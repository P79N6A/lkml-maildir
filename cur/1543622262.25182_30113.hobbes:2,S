First, a big thanks for the help I got so far  (reg. kapm-idled thread)...
Today I've experimented some more, and found the following:
 - even ALSA 0.90beta11 can't solve the suspend problem. I also noticed
   something rather strange, that I didn't realize before  (due to
   auto-loading of modules):
	When I try to load "snd-card-intel8x0" for the first time,
	modprobe complains about the card not being found or being
	busy.
	When I try to load the same module a second time,
	everything works "fine"...
   But - WHY would linux at first say, the card isn't there, but
   find and initialize the card on the second run?
 - Due to the problem with ALSA, I went back to try the kernel
   sound drivers instead and found the i810_audio to work fine
   (and - more importantly - not disturb the suspend... ;)
   ("historically" I switched to ALSA on a TP600 which was a pain
   to get sound working with kernel drivers, but which was fairly
   easy to do with ALSA at the time...   ...and since then I hadn't
   even tried the kernel drivers any more...)
But - the following problems remain:
 -> Hibernation doesn't work at all (this used to work on the TP600
    and on the TP A21P I had before)...
 -> trying to load agpgart (to make DRI work) fails with:
	Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
	agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 816M
	agpgart: Detected an Intel 830M, but could not find the secondary device.
	agpgart: no supported devices found.
 -> When the system resumes from a suspend, the following message
    turns up in dmesg:
	APIC error on CPU0: 00(40)
    (The system appears to work fine, but I'd still like to know,
     what the error is for...?)
 -> prism2_pci (linux-wlan-ng-0.1.10; linux-wlan-ng-0.1.13pre[1-4])
    WLan throughput is VERY low (~18KB/s, as opposed to ~550KB/s
    on a PCMCIA card, linked to the same Wireless access point;
    also - Win2K also reaches 550KB/s on the internal prism2
    chip)...
Any help on any of the above would be highly appreciated! :)
