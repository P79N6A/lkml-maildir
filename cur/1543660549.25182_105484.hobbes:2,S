Yup. The patch gets rids of those lots of inode problems.
But fsx issue is still there.

Ok, So far simplest way of reproducing for me was this:
mkdir /mnt
fsstress -p 10 -n1000000 -d /mnt &
fsx -c 1234 testfile
Now look at fsx output. When it says about "truncating to largest ever: 0x3ffff",
wait 10 more seconds and if nothing happens, ^C the fsx,
run "rm -rf testfile*"
now run fsx again
and so on until it fails.
Last time it took me three iterations to reproduce.
Bye,
    Oleg
