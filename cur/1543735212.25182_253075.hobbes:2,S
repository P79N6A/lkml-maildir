Glad my confusions led to some good.
Let me think about this one a bit.
I had it in my brain that the cpuset_sem should be held across the
entire cpuset_populate_dir(), as if there would be a problem with
another task getting this lock while a directory was half populated.
But I don't know if that was a valid concern, or just a superstition on
my part.  I'll stare at this a bit more, and get back to you, either
way.
