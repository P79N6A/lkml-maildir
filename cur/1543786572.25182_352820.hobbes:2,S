Are you aware that there are very few 'built-in' commands in
any of the shells?  If a user can't execute anything, the
user can't do anything.
If you think that this will protect against improperly-written
daemons, and things that never exec anything, you are wrong.
The place to fix bad code is in the code.

This is a joke, right?

What will they do? I try to execute `ls`, the kernel says I can't
fork and exec `/bin/ls`. So, do I get killed, logged out? The
shells handle errors in different ways. There is a big difference
between how bash handles ENOENT (No such file or directory) and
ENOSYS (Function not implimented).

I think this is just another ruse to attempt to get the system
call table exported, something you don't need to do in order
to replace any of its elements. Am I guessing correctly?
