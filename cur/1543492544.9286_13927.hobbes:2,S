Debian 2.1 (the latest stable) picked up an initial version of my
patches[*], and so does not packet loss when flood pinging the loopback.
    bagpuss# ping -f localhost
    PING localhost (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
    .
    --- localhost ping statistics ---
    6293 packets transmitted, 6292 packets received, 0% packet loss
    round-trip min/avg/max = 0.2/0.7/46.5 ms
