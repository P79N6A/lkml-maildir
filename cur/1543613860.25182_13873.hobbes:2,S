Subject: [PATCH] current state of the 2.5.1 USB tree

Hi,
Since there has been a bit of development lately in the USB tree, and
I'm holding off in submitting USB changes for a bit to Linus while the
bio stuff stabilizes, I thought I would make a snapshot of my current
tree for the other USB developers to sync up with.
A patch against a clean 2.5.1 tree is at:
	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/usb/linux-2.5.1-gregkh-1.patch.gz
This patch contains 5 new USB drivers (stv680, vidcam, ipaq, kl5kusb105,
and the usb 2.0 ehci-hcd driver), documentation for all of these new
drivers, a rewrite of usbdevfs/usbfs, and lots of other smaller fixes
and changes.
If anyone has any questions, problems, or I'm missing any patches that
you have sent to me, please let me know.  (I still have your module
usage patch, Oliver.  I'm waiting for some more discussion before adding
it though.)
And if anyone wants me to post my 2.4 tree (which has most of these same
driver additions), just ask.
thanks,
greg k-h
