A misunderstanding.  Fragmentation happens when an attempt is made to
transmit
a packet bigger than the MTU of the link being used.
This may happen when routing big packets, OR if your software creates a
big packet.
For example NFS trying to send a 8k packet into an ethernet.
The too big packet doesn't have to come from somewhere else, it may be
generated locally by software that doesn't care about the MTU.
