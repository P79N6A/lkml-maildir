Hi list,
Aiglx/Beryl effects (transparency and other stuff) on windows that display 
video worked magically for the first time in a pull point between 2.6.20 and 
2.6.21-rc1. Unfortunately It doesn't work again now in 2.6.21-rc1 and even in 
2.6.20-mm{1,2}.
I'm not able to find the good commit again :(. Could someone please tell
me the files that is most probably responsible for video GL rendering 
so I can track their changes and find the good commit.
The machine is a Centrino laptop with an i810 card. So I guess those are 
the responsible files:
    
    drivers/char/drm/i810_*.c
    drivers/video/i810/*
Any more probably responsible files? 
Thanks,
