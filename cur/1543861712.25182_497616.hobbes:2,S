Subject: [PATCH 2.6.20-rc4] i2c/pci: fix sis96x smbus quirk once and for all
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/8/377

The sis96x SMBus PCI device depends on two different quirks to run
in a specific order.  Apart from being fragile, this was found to
actually break on (at least) recent FC4, FC5, and FC6 kernels.  This
patch fixes the quirks so that they work without relying on the
compiler and/or linker to put them in any specific order.

I tested this patch.  Please apply.
