Thanks Steve.

Its in fs/xfs/quota/xfs_qm.c.

So, we're waiting here on a synchronisation variable that'll
be released once the dquot metadata buffer write completes.

Mhmm, that'd be called by the I/O completion handler on the buffer
containing that dquot.

Right (the former, at this point in the code).

The logforce isn't race-critical here - its ensuring writeout
of previously logged buffers is started before we go to sleep
waiting for the driver to wake us up when its done.
An earlier I/O error on the journal is the only thing the log
force can return as an error there, which isnt useful at that
point anyway (we're in a kernel thread trying to free mem).

Heh, likewise.  I have voodoo dolls of one or two of the early
XFS folks that I like to poke with needles occasionally.. :)

It will sleep until the previously initiated buffer write is done.
AFAICT, we aren't seeing the I/O completion here for some reason...
which points more to a possible device driver or h/ware issue (that
is the usual root cause of this sort of hang, anyway).
cheers.
