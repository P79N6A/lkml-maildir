Thanks,
I looked it up its called watchdog (what else). It was set to 5000ms and I 
changed it to 300ms. But the result is : no change!
I can see the transmit and receives on the switch. The problem must be the 
receive part of the transceiver.
I ran mii-diag and it reports that it is set up for full duplex 100Mbit and 
has a link. So that reports back ok.
Any other ideas ?
