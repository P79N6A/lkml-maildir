Two reasons actually !
- The set of patches posted by Jan last was on 2.6.23-rc8-mm1. So I
thought let me help Andrew a bit by making them available on latest
-mm :) And I didn't know that these were already under consideration
by Andrew.
- The set of patches posted by Jan didn't even pass compile test for me.
So I made sure that the patches compiled and worked on x86, x86_64 and powerpc.

Bharata.
