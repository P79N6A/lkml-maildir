Yes, I went ahead and tried that.  I also had do it in usbout_start()
and usbin_sync_completed().  Now I can play audio without any of those
warnings showing up in the log.
This may be unrelated, but I also see the usb audio device fail after
some uses.  For example, using xine with the oss output module will only
play audio for a short time, then audio stops.  After that point it is
impossible to restore audio function from everything I've tried.  I am
unable to kill -9 xine successfully, and unable to rmmod the usb audio
driver to try and reload it.  Only a full reboot will bring it back to
life (I'm sure there are things I haven't tried...)
