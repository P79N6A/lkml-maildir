OK, that's a start.  I think there was some work done on making
kernel_stat percpu as well.
Cleaning up and speeding up kernel_stat is a spearate exercise
of course, but as we need to change userspace we may as well roll
it all up together.

b).  Let's get the kernel right and change userspace to follow.  We have
another accounting patch which breaks top(1), so Rik has fixed it (and
is feeding the fixes upstream).

Does it work with the utilities at

  What is the
relationship with the 2.4 sard work?  (I've never used sard, so words
of one syllable please ;))
If we can get this work playing nicely with those existing sard tools,
get the kernel_stat stuff cleaned up and get the relevant userspace
tools working and merged upstream then we have a neat bundle to submit.
