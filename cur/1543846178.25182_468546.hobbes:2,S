Hello,
maybe this helps: 
http://bugday.gentoo.org/sandbox.html.
Basically the sandbox is a kind of security mechanism that prevents
files from being created outside a specific directory during package
installation phases (unpacking, compiling ..).
If the package uses KBuild to make a kernel module the sandbox is
triggered under 2.6.18-mm1 because of the temporary file creation in the
kernel directory.
Of course this feature can be bypassed (e.g. disable sandbox), but if
there is a way to do these tests without file creation it would be much
more consistent. Btw. is there a reason for creating the file? AFAICS
there is not test performed on it?
I have to admit that due to the nature of -mm of being a testbed this is
not a critical issue.
