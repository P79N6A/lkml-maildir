Where's the problem? Use .../disc for whole disc or .../part4 for
"normal" access. (Or /dev/hdc and /dev/hdc4 if you prefer) It is nice if
partition code can detect it but it is not ide-floppy driver problem.

Why complicate things more than needed?

When I boot without media in Jaz drive I get something like "no media
inserted, assuming 1GB 512B per sector". Actually I modeled my patch
from this - use some default values reported by drive when no media
currently exists.
