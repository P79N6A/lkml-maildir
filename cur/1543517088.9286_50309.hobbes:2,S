hi everybody!
as far as i can tell, a ramdrive gets handled the same as every other block
device and is therefore also cached. is there (currently) an easy way to
stop this?
I'd prefer a ramdrive to the ordinary buffer cache in this case because I
can exactly define what is always in ram.
but if it gets buffered, it would spend buffers on something already in
memory.
is there something like the unbuffered partition entries, a "raw"-ramdrive?
regards,
phil
