I was using the wrong fd. The following works:
  struct usb_device *dev;
  [...]
  struct usb_device_handle udev = usb_open(dev);
  struct usbdevfs_ioctl command = { 0, USBDEVFS_DISCONNECT, 0 };
  ioctl(udev->fd, USBDEVFS_IOCTL, &command)
Now the only thing left to figure out is how the libusb library
expects us to do this, because struct usb_device_handle; is not
implemented in the exported interface.
I guess the solution is to implement the above functionality in
libusb itself.

there are 3 types of guys -- the ones who hate nerds (all nerds, that
is; girls aren't let off the hook); the ones who are scared off by
girls who are slightly more intelligent than average; and the guys who
are also somewhat more intelligent than average, but are so shy that
they can't put 2 words together when they're within 20 feet of a girl.
