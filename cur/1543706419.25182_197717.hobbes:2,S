kernel bug at mm/slab.c:1107!
invalid operand:0000 [#1]
SMP
(this happened just after the Console: and Memory: lines)
This didn't happen with 2.6.1-mm4 (that's the last -mm I tried). I can try to 
track down where it started later, but this is my firewall, so I have to wait 
till everyone goes to sleep first.
