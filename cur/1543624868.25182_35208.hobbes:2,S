if you look closely at the typedef above, you'll notice that it doesn't
introduce a _new_ type, but only a synonym for the 'int' type, which
happens to be the type used in 2.4 kernels...
typedef int (* transfer_proc_t)(struct loop_device *, int cmd,
                                char *raw_buf, char *loop_buf, int size,
                                int real_block);
what I'm trying to do by the introduction of this _aesthetic_ syntactic
element, is to prepare the way to smoothly upgrade the type used for the
IV value; and more important to keep filter modules from having to add 
ugly #ifdef LINUX_VERSION_CODE <= KERNEL(2,X,Y)... just for changes
which could be catched by kernel headers...
have you ever wondered, why even the C standard defines some typedefs as
size_t instead of using just a 'long'?

as older kernels will likely have the variable-IV-metric, they'll have
to be patched anyway (loop.[ch]), and after having patched them, the
problem vanishes...

actually it's just -- either make my life harder w/ cryptoapi or not, as
it doesn't affect other implementations; but other implementations may
start to use those typedefs in the future, so when 2.6 (or whatever
comes out) the 'current' 2.6 has them already, and the 'ultra-stable'
2.4's will have them as well... and maybe everybody is happy, that he
can compile the same c source against both, 2.4 and 2.6, loop.h and
still get a correct filter module...

I don't see why... loop_iv_t is just a 'reviced-declarator-type-list
int', i.e. it is is type compatible w/ an 'int'... so you won't even
notice the difference when compiling loop-AES against it...

yeah, sure... at the expense of having to redundantly keep track (ugly
#ifdef's) of which kernel version is being used...
another reason I haven't mentioned so far is about the #define's;
#define LOOP_IV_SECTOR_BITS 9
#define LOOP_IV_SECTOR_SIZE (1 << LOOP_IV_SECTOR_BITS)
...if you don't see any reason for those 2 innocent #define then you
won't see any reason for other #define in the kernel headers as well;
e.g.:
fs.h:
#define BLOCK_SIZE_BITS 10
#define BLOCK_SIZE (1<<BLOCK_SIZE_BITS)
you may ask why those are used, since they are hardcoded anyway... well,
lemme show you an example where this would considerably help:
loop.c:
static unsigned long compute_loop_size(struct loop_device *lo, struct
dentry * lo_dentry, kdev_t lodev)
{
        if (S_ISREG(lo_dentry->d_inode->i_mode))
                return (lo_dentry->d_inode->i_size - lo->lo_offset) >> BLOCK_SIZE_BITS;
        if (blk_size[MAJOR(lodev)])
                return blk_size[MAJOR(lodev)][MINOR(lodev)] -
                                (lo->lo_offset >> BLOCK_SIZE_BITS);
        return MAX_DISK_SIZE;
}
and now imagine the same source fragment, with the #define's
evaluated... wouldn't that be less self-explaining?
well, I hope I could make clear to you, why using symbolic constants and
the use of typedefs in C are good practice in general wrt software
engineering...
