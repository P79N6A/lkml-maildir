I'll try upgrading from gcc-4.0 to gcc-4.1, and if/when that has no
effect, I'll go looking for a later binutils in Debian's "unstable"
tree (I've already had to go to the "testing" tree to get beyond gcc-3
and binutils-2.15.X).  Report to follow later today.
Item for consideration: what kind of optimization is enabled for your
test case compile vs. what's being used for the kernel build?  That's
another variable we need to sort out.  For what it's worth, I do *not*
have CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE enabled: the comment about "watch out
for broken compilers" was enough to scare me off while we're trying to
chase this down.
