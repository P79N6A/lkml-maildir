Sorry about that. It's on my home machine and I turn it off at night to
save power (and money). It should be online all day.

Actually now I get a different error, and it happens before the final
linkage step at which I used to get an error. But I think it might be an
error with GCC. There's a little blurb about submitting a bug report.

I've compiled quite a few kernels with a 3.2.x gcc and I've never run
into problems before. I'll change that to 2.95 and see what happens.
I've attached my .config to a private email following this one.
Thanks for your input,
