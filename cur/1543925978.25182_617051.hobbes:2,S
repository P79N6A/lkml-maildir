Ummm ... that's not what the /spec/ says.  I've never worked on any shpc
machines, but the shpc driver reads the slot values from the SLOT_CONFIG
register, just like the spec says to.
I don't understand how you're supposed to get the slot number for
standard PCI for occupied slots.  Could you explain?
