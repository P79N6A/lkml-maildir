You WHAT? Read the documentation! :-) I thought the ones calling the function should do that.
I dunno, I'm not hotplugging anything and it crashes anyway, The functionality is there since
I want to hotplug a camera sometimes. but I'm not always "doing it" during uptimes that have
the crash. Anyway I assume the crux here is PCI hotplug that my machine does not do; you
need special support on the motherboard for that, right?
I found some options to try out, but no conclusive info, at the nvidia linux discussion forum.
