Hi Chas, thanks for the patch.  I agree that it is correct.  However,
I was wondering about ioctl and proc calls.  Can the ATM layer call
a driver's ioctl routine before opening a vcc?  If so, does it take a
reference to the module first (I didn't spot anything)?  Also, are
calls to a driver's proc_read routine protected against module
unloading races (I confess I didn't take the time to look into this,
because my own driver does not sleep in proc_read)?
All the best,
Duncan.
