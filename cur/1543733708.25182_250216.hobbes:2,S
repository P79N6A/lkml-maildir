Completley different model.  VFS supports lots of filesystem implementation
with one interface.  IRQ code is a a single implementation for each
architecture.

s390 doesn't need it at all because it doesn't have the concept of hardirqs.
At least arm{,26}, m68k{,nommu} and parisc and sparc{,64} use extremly
different models for irq handling
