Subject: Linux 2.2.17 broken with initrd

I've been fighting with this for a couple of days now.  I've been trying
under lilo, syslinux, and grub to get the kernel to follow the documented
behavior of executing /linuxrc if you tell it to load an initrd as it did
back in 2.0.35 (which was the last time I actually tried to use an initrd
for anything..)
The 2.4.0test kernels work fine.  For the record:
-­8<--  /usr/src/linux-2.2.17
      :
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE=4096
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
      :
--8<--
Any ideas why this isn't working?  More importantly, if this is known not
to work right, how are distributions coping with the inability to use
/linuxrc?  Documentation other than that in the kernel tree which was
written in 1996 seems to be scarce.

My opinions might not be Progeny's.  Even if they're not, I'm still right.
