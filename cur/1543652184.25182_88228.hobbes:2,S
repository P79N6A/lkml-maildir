Subject: [RFC] Clean up scsi documentation

Hi,
currently the documentation for scsi is not completely located where it should 
IMHO be: in Documentation/
There are a few files in Documentation and much more files in drivers/scsi/ . 
I think this should be fixed. Any thougts?
My way would be:
1) create a directory Documentation/scsi/
2) move everything to this location
3) rename some of the docs (currently the names look like "README.drivername" 
but "drivername.txt" is more common in Documentation/*)
4) fix up the references
5) add a 00-INDEX file to Documentation/scsi
Linus, Marcello: would you apply such a patch? In which form would you like to 
get them? One big patch? One patch that moves the files and one to fix the 
references? A patch to move the files and a patch for the references?
I found also some minor bugs in some docs: trailing newlines, strange 
characters etc. This will be an extra patch.
Eike
