I agree.  I would like to replace the racache with a "struct file"
cache (though it isn't high on my priorities).
The only issue that I can see (except for simple coding) is that as
NFS cannot be precise about closing at the *right* time we would be
changing from closing too early (and so re-opening) to closing too
late.
Would this be an issue for any filesystem?  My feeling is not, but I'm
open to opinions....
This is an issue for the user-space NFS daemon.  It caches open
filedescriptors and an open O_RDWR will imply an active
get_write_access which, for example, stops the file being executed on
the server.
kNFSd won't suffer from this as it can drop write_access without
closing the file.  Are there any other issues?
