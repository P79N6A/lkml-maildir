Basically you are saying that if i disagree, my view is irrelevant. What do you
expect with this kind of start.

Nobody told against a small delay , in most of the case that is already what is
happening today. 
There is a little problem in this rhetoric. You want fix fast and disclosure
latter. As soon as the fix (we are talking about source available) is out, the
hole is too. Wondering if chiken or egg is great flame subject.

Does this resume to :
I want my company to be in control. And nobody else please, because i do not
trust them.
Who would you want in this security board ? No hackers i believe they have no
incentive to shut the *** up, they do not care about money or their buisness or
who knows why.
So you want :
a/ everyboddy is wrong, we cannot understand,
b/ crackers "are too lazy in many cases to read the high-level hacker boards"
c/ "How can i have fix without ever having a hole ?".
Close your eyes and believe, that s the only way to achieved absolute safety.
I am not kidding, billions of people does this, it seems efficient (only few
dies by accident).
d/ the world is mad , nobody cares about security except who we are in charge
(and have no power in the politics).
e/ i don t care who does the job but i want my god damn system to have no holes.
Sorry for this rude analysis . I assume you want :
1/ a way to be alerted of the security hole of your application stack , and
those only.
2/ fix before the script kiddies.
For one the fix is quite easy, it is a matter of getting security alerts in an
easy way (maybe newsletter are getting old, what about a web as amazon does for
stuff) and a filter on your application stack.
For two, nobody can help. Script kiddies does not even read tech lists. They do
not make the scripts. Those who made them usually don't just read ML, they read
source, even binaries.
And those who make a living of cracking usually do not tell anybody. No CERT
alert. The only hope is easy to read code, audit.

i bet you don't know what script kiddies is all about , those who want to stole
your identity does not fit there (neither XSS, pishing nor script kiddies
 relate to kernel devel in most case).
Afaik the problem discussed in this thread was not about customer as you and I
to be alerted but upstream to have the patch at the same time. And maybe for the
distribution to share patches faster.
About politics:

been there done that. You cannot master security, be the sole administrator and
deal with internal company politics (and maybe provide scripts, macros and
documentation if time permits). This has nothing to do with the way the kernel
deal with security alerts. We are not only paid to secure everything and admin.
But to make choices and the right ones as ressources are limited.
You could look for debian kernel , you have fixes backported , so you do not
have to worry about a new feature breaking an app or an ABI change.
All server distributions does it. Most distributions also alert their users
about those security hole you should be warned about. Just subscribe to their
security ML.
About us as users of binaries, those problems are already resolved by 
distribution security teams.
