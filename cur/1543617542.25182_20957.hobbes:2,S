agreed.

I'm not sure how simpler it will make things and I'd prefer to keep the
pte in highmem also with 4G to be more generic, think 1000 threads
mapping the same 1G of shm each, ok that may sound a bit insane but
it's not that far from some setup that triggered the pte problem.

yes.

the pte_offset_nokmap will have to return a page actually, I was hiding
the "page" stuff in the header, that's it, but I'm fine to add a nokmap
that returns a page (not a pte) and to call kmap_atomic by hand to get
the pte_t *. Also there are non obvious implications if the pte is not
large as a page, but I'm not aware of any arch where a pte is not large
as a page... in the common code only pte_alloc play with pages as pte so
far.

I'm glad to hear :). btw, I don't expect big difference for 2.5, that
area should be pretty much the same. I was a bit sick in the last days,
I'll try to make the above cleanups soon and then to port to 2.5. thanks,
Forget to tell, another bit to cleanup is the pte_quicklist, that has to
be converted to a list_head, doing a kmap_atomic to queue pages into the
quicklist is very stupid at the moment, I just wanted to make it working
first, then to fix this bit, I'll clean it up in one of the next version
(but in the meantime is just usable).
