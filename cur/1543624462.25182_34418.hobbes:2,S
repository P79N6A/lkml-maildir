Regarding proposed ATA filtering, this touches somewhat on something I've
been thinking about for a while: biodump.
Basically, biodump is to a block device what tcpdump is to a network
adaptor.
So we would be able to do this:
# biodump /dev/hda
09:09:33.023 READ block 12345 [10 blocks]
09:09:33.024 READ block 12355 [10 blocks]
09:09:33.025 READ block 12365 [10 blocks]
09:09:34.000 WRITE block 12345 [1 block]
Or somewhat more fancy, and only useful for non-growing files:
# biodump /var/db/bigdb/tablefile
file on /dev/hda, getting blockmap:
09:09:33.023 READ logical block 12345 [10 blocks]
09:09:33.024 READ logical block 12355 [10 blocks]
09:09:33.025 READ logical block 12365 [10 blocks]
09:09:34.000 WRITE logical block 12345 [1 block]
Because right now, we have no idea why that disk light is blinking. If
somebody implements a filter, it would be a natural place to also provide
a dumping hook.
biodump might in fact turn out to become atadump and scsidump (which is
rather sad actually).

bert
