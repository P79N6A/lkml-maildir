I don't think you will get support from anyone for non-english messages
in the kernel.  Some people think there is already too much text segment
in the kernel (c.f. tests that show kernel size shrinks by 200kB or whatever
when printk is defined to a no-op).
There was a proposal to make printks be more generic/consistent by someone
at IBM, but I don't know what happened to it.
My suggestion would be to add the required i18n support to klogd, so that
kernel messages are translated as they are removed from dmesg into syslog.
Then, like any i18n support, you build a message catalog from the printk
strings in the kernel and have klogd do the lookups/translation in user
space.
Cheers, Andreas
