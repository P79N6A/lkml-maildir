Hi,
Recently, I found that cloning from GIT server has been failed.
I'm using following script for it.
---
...
rm -r /home/git/kernels/2.4/linux-2.4.git
cg-clone
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/marcelo/linux-2.4.git/
/home/git/kernels/2.4/linux-2.4.git/
sync
rm -r /home/git/kernels/2.4/linux-2.6.git
cg-clone
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git/
/home/git/kernels/2.4/linux-2.6.git/
sync
rm -r /home/git/kernels/2.4/scsi-misc-2.6.git
cg-clone
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/marcelo/scsi-misc-2.6.git
/home/git/kernels/2.4/scsi-misc-2.6.git
sync

In the script, I'm cloning 3 different sources. First two sources
getting successfully cloned, however, last one is getting failed with
following error messages,

Above script worked without any problem when I started several months
ago and I'm not sure when did it stop working.
I'm using _cron_ utility on my Linux box for scheduled execution of the
script.
Any comment would be appreciated.
Thank you,
Seokmann
