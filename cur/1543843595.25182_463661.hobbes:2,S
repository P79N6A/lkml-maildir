I believe this has been addressed by Frank in his other email, so I'll
skip.

Yes, and this specific suggestion has been made a number of times.
Though, then, this is an implementation debate and there are number
of things which could be made available as build-time options. The
emerging consensus in this thread, however, that there is a clear
need for a way for statically marking up important events, and this
point has been emphasized both by those who have maintained
infrastructure based on "static" tracepoints and those maintaining
such infrastructure based on "dynamic" tracepoints.

Sure, if you're a kernel developer, but as I've explained numberous
times in this thread, there are far more many users of tracing than
kernel developers.

Please see Mathieu's earlier posting of numbers comparing kprobes to
static points. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the use of kprobes
should be pitted against static instrumentation, the two are
orthogonal.
