Storage requirements would be 16GB of RAM... that's small enough. If
you sort, you'll only need 32*2^32 comparisons, and that's doable.
I do not claim it is _likely_. You'd need hardlinks, as you
noticed. But system should work, not "work with high probability", and
I believe we should solve this in long term.
