Thanks for that Ben. I now used a 64 bit,133 MHz PCI-X on both
machines and I got around  180 MBps, (86259.48 + 95164.90 ), which is
still a decent way away from Line speed. I think PCI is not a
bottleneck now, although I could be wrong. What could I be missing,
and has anybody seen line speed ( 220 MBps ) with e1000 ?
Regards and Thanks
