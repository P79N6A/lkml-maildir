I think I know at least _when_ it happens: during compilation of glibc.
This was almost certainly while compiling in the normal amd64 environment:

And this was while compiling the glibc in an i386 unstable chroot:

Could it be that some glibc unit test triggers this?
I have done one other compile of glibc yesterday though that did _not_ 
trigger the error, but that was using pbuilder (i.e. in an amd64 chroot).
