Nod, this one is better.
They do roughly the same thing, while the latter interface is more portable.
Another note: if you do not know precisely which files to readahead, turn on
aggressive readahead feature temporary might help. There are mainly three
parameters that controls the aggressiveness, the following example values should
be large enough:
echo 16 > /proc/sys/vm/readahead_hit_rate   # overlook hit rate?
echo 1000 > /proc/sys/vm/readahead_ratio    # grow up ra-size quickly?
blockdev --setra 8192 /dev/had              # large ra-size limit?
Thanks,
Wu
