I know, but for multiple people testing daily releases it's much easier to
say -git1 worked -git2 didn't. Sure, for searching the patch `git bisect`
is priceless but for regular testing the -gitx thing comes very handy.
Otherwise you can get a arbitrary intermediate state of linus tree if
you're pulling at the wrong moment. It's actually also faster I suppose
to get one patch than running `git pull` - at least with a cold cache
(it used to be in the 0.1 days of git).
Just my .02,
