OK, I'll feed patches to you, then.  No inconvenience intended.
Thanks for applying the patches.

Oops.

Will do.

Would your preference be to slap #ifdefs around those, or to just
require CONFIG_NET in Kconfig?  The core driver should work fine without
any kernel-level networking support, so I suppose the former makes more
sense.

That's going to be interesting to test, because I don't have any ia64
hardware to even compile on.  I have tested on x86_64 and powerpc, so
this seems like an arch-level header deficiency.  Any idea what to do
about it?

I've been building with C=1 for months.  I'll see if I can figure out
why you're getting such different results.
