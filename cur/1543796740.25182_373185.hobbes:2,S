I've fixed bugs which turned out to be security vulnerabilities. And I
didn't know (or even care much) at the time. Finding out if some random bug
has security implications, and exactly which ones/how much of a risk they
pose is normally /much/ harder than to fix the bugs.  And rather pointless,
after the fix is in.
