As proposed some time ago [1], I'll continue the 2.6.16.x series after 
2.6.17 will be released.
A short FAQ is below.

Q:
What will be the rules for patch inclusion in the 2.6.16.x series?
A:
There will be more relaxed rules similar to the rules in kernel 2.4 
after the release of kernel 2.6.0 (e.g. driver updates will be allowed).
Q:
Why not start with the more relaxed rules before the release of 2.6.17?
A:
After 2.6.16.y following the usual stable rules, the kernel should be 
relatively stable and well-tested giving the best possible basis for a 
long-living series.
Q:
How long will this 2.6.16 series be maintained?
A:
That depends on how long people use it and contribute patches.
Q:
Stable API/ABI for external modules?
A:
No.
