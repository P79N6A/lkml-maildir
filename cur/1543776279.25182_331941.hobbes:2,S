I've been digging around for quite a while and finally hoped that 
someone here may be able to help me out. In the 2.6.12 kernel, 
if_pppox.h changed a few items. I wanted to know if there is someone in 
particular who maintains that particular area of the kernel, and an 
email address for them.
Thanks,
Neal Schilling
