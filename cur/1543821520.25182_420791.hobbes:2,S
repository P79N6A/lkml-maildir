So why don't we just build a VGA class driver or make null fbdev
drivers? That solution works and stays in the model of one driver per
device and user space using a device driver to control the hardware.
This is a known problem and we have a valid solution, why build a new
API perpetuating the old model? If there wasn't a workable alternative
available I wouldn't be complaining.
Have you seen this method of getting root from X?

It is referenced from Theo de Raadt interview on kerneltrap

I am happy to see progress being made at getting X out of the PCI bus business.
