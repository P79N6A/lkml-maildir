Hi Ingo,
Just so I don't screw this thing up, exactly what am I to 'pull' to fix
this error (listed at the end of this command sequence)?
Thanks,
Mike

    x86: arch_probe_nr_irqs
    Impact: save RAM with large NR_CPUS, get smaller nr_irqs
    Estimating NR_IRQS based on NR_CPUS results in excessive memory used for
    items like arrays sized by NR_IRQS.  This patch adds an arch specific
    'probe' or discovery routine to calculate the minimum number of slots
    required to handle the number of irqs on the running system.  The result
    is placed in the 'nr_irqs' variable.
    As an example, a system configured with NR_CPUS=4096 that has in fact
    8 cpu cores, results in a reduction from 33024 to 320 for the number of
    irqs required.  This is shown in a system log message:
        NR_IRQS:33024 nr_irqs:320
    Of course, this requires that other code dynamically allocate their irq
    arrays using nr_irqs instead of NR_IRQS.  An example is in early_irq_init()
    when CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ is true.
    Currently, the only arch that has this probe function is x86.  A default
    weak arch_probe_nr_irqs function is placed in kernel/softirq.c, to avoid
    a problem with some gcc's that do not handle weak functions correctly,
    if they are in the same file as the reference.
