The problem is that with the busy flag on we are wasting quite
a significant amount of CPU time spinning around it for no good...
Right now I'm quite confident about the idea of just having
two queues ata_queue and atapi_queue on the channel possible
shared among two channels. This will make the CPU cycle waste
occur only in the case of channels where ATA and ATAPI devices
are mixed as master and slave. This will work becouse the
only really crucial queue property which has to be device type
specific is the hardsect size.
Quite the same design as in, well, FreeBSD.
As a second step we could do just the following - block one
of the queues if the second one is active right now... This should
be simpler than doing it on the per device level by the busy flag and
wasting CPU time around it.
