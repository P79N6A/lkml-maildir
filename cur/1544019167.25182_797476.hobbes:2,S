I guess the relevant people might. Sending it to wrong people and to
a wrong mailing list, doesn't help much i guess.
That function does a step through a "next slice" of the RF carrier
based on a RF center frequency, which is used for carrier acquisition.

Ranges can go negative, from the current offset to the left anything
is negative, to the right it is positive. There of course is a bug
that the variable is not signed.
I have pushed out a fix out here at
http://jusst.de/hg/v4l-dvb/rev/368dc6078295
including your comment on the macros. Thanks for pointing the bug.
