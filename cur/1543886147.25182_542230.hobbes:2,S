Subject: [PATCH] early_pfn_to_nid needs to be __meminit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/9/311

since it is referenced by memmap_init_zone (which is __meminit) via the
early_pfn_in_nid macro when CONFIG_NODES_SPAN_OTHER_NODES is set (which
basically means PowerPC 64).
This removes a section mismatch warning in those circumstances.
