Thanks! ...so you were able to get most of stuff working, but do not
have qt/gpe working, and probably do not have suspend working so
battery life is really bad, right?
OTOH you can dual boot with symbian... so battery life is not _as_ bad
problem. Do you need windows machine to apply patch allowing you to
run uboot? Is there easy way to tell difference between 32MB and 24MB
sx1's? Getting 24MB part would spoil all the fun, I'm afraid...
