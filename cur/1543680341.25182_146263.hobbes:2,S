Well, your patch does have the advantage of not being a "break all
drivers" affair.
Also, even though pgcl scales "perfectly" wrt. highmem (nm the code
being a train wreck), the raw capacity increase is needed. There are
enough other reasons to go through with ABI-preserving page clustering
that they're not really in competition with each other.
Looks good to me. I'll spin it up tonight.
