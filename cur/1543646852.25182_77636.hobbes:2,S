It's just my best guess, but I'd say there's something wrong with your
modules.

Subject: Kernel-oops
Dear kernel-developers,
recently I get quite a lot of kernel oopses. Before 2.4.17 my system
ran very stable but since upgrading to 2.4.18 and still with 2.4.19 I
get an oops every few days.
Can you help me with these? Do you need any additional information?
Attached is the output of ksymoops.
Thanks a lot in advance
yours
  Andreas Bergen
