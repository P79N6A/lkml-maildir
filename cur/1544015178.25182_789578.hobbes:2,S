Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core fixes for your 2.6-git tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/9/436

Here are 4 reverts of patches that were previously pulled into your git
tree.  They revert the ability for the driver core to have a private
area in struct device.
Thanks to Stefan Richter for pointing out the problems with the current
implementation, and for Alan Cox persuading me to rework the whole
thing, which I will do for the 2.6.30 release.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-core-2.6.git/
The patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
