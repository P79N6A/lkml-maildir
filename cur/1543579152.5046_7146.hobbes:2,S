Subject: [QUESTION]: Applying patches ontop of patches (2.4.1pre7 to 2.4.1pre8)

What is the best way to apply a patch on top of a patch already applied?
For example, with original sources 2.4.0 i applied 2.4.1pre7 but now
that pre8 is out, how do i apply those new patches without having to
delete the whole linux dir and untar 2.4.0 again just to apply pre8?
thanks,
Shawn S.
