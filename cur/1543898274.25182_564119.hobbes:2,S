The #define controls which descriptors are statically linked
into every object.  I suppose someone could submit a patch which
does that differently ... I'm not keen on having lots of "will
never use" data bloating any driver, but it could be moved to
__initdata, at the cost of adding code to kmalloc (and kfree)
all the individual descriptors.  Restricting code bloat to init
sections would still be worse than no bloat...

This was cloned from code which predates dma pools.  :)
Regardless, I'm planning to remove that interface from the gadget stack.
It's utility is far exceeded by the number of controller driver bugs
in that area.  Plus, if any gadget driver needs such a mechanism, the
dma_pool stuff that now exists could be called directly.

ISTR this class of error would be reported by sparse ("make check").
