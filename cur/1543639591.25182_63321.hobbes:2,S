You'll also find that reiserfs scales much better on machines with many 
processors with this patch in use.  It still is very coarse grained 
compared to V4, but the bitmap scanning was consuming so much CPU while 
locking out other processors that it was a performance problem for one 
person measuring our performance on 8-way machines.
