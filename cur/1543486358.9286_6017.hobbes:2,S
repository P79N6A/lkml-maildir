Under original RedHat-5.2 2.0.36 kernel I got the oops too. I tried
disable DMA mode on EIDE harddisk, but it didn't help.
Server config:
- QDI Briliant IV motherboard (dual CPU, Adaptec 7880 SCSI controller,
  Intel EtherExpresPro/100)
- 2 x PII 350 CPU
- 2 x IBM DCAS4330 HDD
- WDC 1.2 GB HDD
- 2 x 128 MB SDRAM memory
- 2 x NE2000 PCI
Oops appears when I run 5 bonnie harddisk-tests or
when server is running longer than few days.
