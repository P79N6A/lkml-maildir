Yes. I want to take .config file from your kernel tree

I'll compile 2.5.1-pre8 here and try to boot my initrd.
If it boots ok, it would mean there is no problem with kernel
(i.e. my fault), if it won't, that will imply that _some_ minix initrds
are affected. Hope you got the idea...
BTW, is it possible for you to place your initrd on some publicly accessible 
ftp/http server?
