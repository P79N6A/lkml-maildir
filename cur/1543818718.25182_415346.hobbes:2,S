Subject: [PATCH] support for panic at OOM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch adds a feature to panic at OOM, oom_die.
When sysctl vm.oom_die = 1, the kernel panics intead of killing
rogue processes. And if vm.oom_die is 0 the kernel will do
oom_kill() in the same way as it does today. Of course, the 
default value is 0 and only root can modifies it.
In general, oom_killer works well and kill rogue processes. So 
the whole system can survive. But there are environments where
panic is preferable rather than kill some processes.
For example, a failover system can replace a broken system with
back-up system immediately at panic, so it doesn't need oom_kill.
Considering a failover cluster system, a failover service puts
all nodes under its observation. When a node panics, the failover
system  can replace it with new one immediately. But if oom_kill runs
and kills some processes, the system will go to partial broken
state. This partial broken state is sometimes difficult to be
detected. The worst case is that a failover daemon is killed 
(possibility is not 0%), the whole system will be unstable.
Another case is crash-dump supported system. If the system panics
at OOM, crash dump can preserve *all* information about system.
Because SIGKILL cannot cause process coredump, oom killer cannot
preserve any hints except for the message log.

==
This patch adds oom_die sysctl under sys.vm.
When oom_die==1, system panic at out_of_memory istead of kill some
process. In some situation, I think panic is more useful than kill.
This patch is against 2.6.17-rc1-mm2.
