Indeed, Andi made a good point : some people compile for 386 as a generic
target which can potentially run on more recent hardware with ACPI support.
May be we should consider this behaviour broken anyway, since there are
other features that will never be available, such as TSC. So why not simply
disable ACPI for 386 ?

chances of being the definitive solution :-)
