Any solution which involves a function being called from a kernel
thread, and/or passing another arg to a kernel thread, is a non-starter
...  See the discussion about timer_exit() a while ago.  This sort of
thing should be done at a higher level.  Not only does that eliminate
any possibility of a race between thread function calling
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT/up_and_exit and module unload, but it also allows us
to more easily implement wait_for_kernel_thread_to_die() without having
to do silly stuff like pass extra args to threads (...modifying the
thread API in the process).
IMHO it is possible to solve this in a generic way without having to
change the code for every single kernel thread.
Thanks for all the explanation, I think I now understand all the stuff
your kernel thread is doing.  Your solution sounds like a decent
solution for the problem described.  I have not looked at the socket
driver code observe parse_events() usage, so I cannot say whether your
problem description is accurate however :)
