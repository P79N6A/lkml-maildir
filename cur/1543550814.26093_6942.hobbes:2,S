It is not so difficult as it looks.
The master pgd looking as:
.org 0x1000
ENTRY(swapper_pg_dir)
        .long 0x00102007
        .long 0x00103007
        .fill BOOT_USER_PGD_PTRS-2,4,0
        /* default: 766 entries */
        .long 0x00102007
        .long 0x00103007
        /* default: 254 entries */
        .fill BOOT_KERNEL_PGD_PTRS-2,4,0
should become:
.org 0x1000
ENTRY(swapper_pg_dir)
        .long 0x00102007
        .long 0x00103007
	....			# every entry addresses 4 MB exactly
	....			# so add as much as you want
	.long 0x0010X007
        .fill BOOT_USER_PGD_PTRS-X+2,4,0
        /* default: 766-X entries */
        .long 0x00102007
        .long 0x00103007
	....			# every entry addresses 4 MB exactly
	....			# so add as much as you want
        /* default: 254-X entries */
        .fill BOOT_KERNEL_PGD_PTRS-X+2,4,0
empty_zero_page, empty_bad_page, etc... offsets should be also
appropriately changed and the corresponding code in mm init as
well.
But i honestly don't see the point of all that.
best,
Petkan
