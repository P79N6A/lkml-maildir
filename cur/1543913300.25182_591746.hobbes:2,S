What does "it" stand for in this sentence?
My patch was tested to work in my limited testing,
but it is very conservative.
I can't talk for Marcelo, but his patch probably worked too,
it just didn't guarantee that you can install kernel, and
then compile and load external module. Wel, it will compile,
but maybe will fail to load.
It sounds like *in-tree modules* were loading
just fine for Marcelo.
