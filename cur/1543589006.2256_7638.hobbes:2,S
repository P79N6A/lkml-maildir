I once debugged a very simular sounding problem that I solved with
the following patch to login. It's a wild guess, but you could try if
it happens to solve it. If not it might at least be a hint of what has to
be done to su.
(the problem is that the extra process PAM keeps waiting is process leader)
(I don't have redhat, so I can't check if this is relevant here)
