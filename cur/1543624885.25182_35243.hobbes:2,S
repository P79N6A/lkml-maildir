I gave the patch a go, here is the before and after for the kernel
compile benchmark. As you can see d_lookup and atomic_dec_and_lock
have both dropped. Since the main bottleneck for us is still the
ppc64 mm code, we didnt see a noticable drop in wall clock time.
It would be interesting to try the patch on a large specweb run,
Ive seen the dcache lock become a problem when running 8 way specweb.
