BTW. We'll probably want to increase the width of some counters
in struct page at some point for 64-bit, so then it really will
go over with the memory controller!
Actually, an external data structure is a pretty good idea. We
could probably do it easily with a radix tree (pfn->memory
controller). And that might be a better option for distros.
