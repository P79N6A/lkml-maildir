I was able to get the D-Link to work in half-duplex (100bt), but
not in auto-negotiate or full-duplex mode.  (Packets would pass,
but there would be huge number of carrier and other bad packets.)
I get a similar problem with the ZNYX 4-port, but I can't even
force it to half-duplex, or any other fixed speed (it just won't go).
It kinda autonegotiates something, claiming to be full-duplex, but it
still shows collisions and I can't get through-put above about 10Mbps
bi-directional, and its dropping many packets.
