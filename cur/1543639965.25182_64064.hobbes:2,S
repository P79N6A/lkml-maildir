Subject: can't use 2.4 on my 486 server

I use 2.4 kernel for a long time on my workstations, but can't use it on old
486 server with 16MB RAM. 2.2 works there without problems (for a long time).
But few hours after running 2.4.19 server is unreachable. When I connect
monitor/keyboard and start it again I see fsck starting then:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address db9910c0
(...)
Kernel panic: aiee, killing interrupt handler.
I've tried 2.4.18 and earlier versions before. Always same problem. There is
fsck 1.22 and glibc-2.2.3 there - standard Slackware 8.0 distribution which
works on other computers.
What should I check? What should i try to change there? What more info can I
give you (is it important to rewrite full kernel message with all registers?) ?
