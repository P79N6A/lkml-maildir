Hi.
Just to let you know that I have it working with Suspend2. One thing I
am concerned about is that we still need a way of determining whether a
process has been signalled but not yet frozen. At the moment you just
check p->todo, but if/when other functionality begins to use the todo
list, this will be unreliable.
I'm happy to supply the patches I'm using if you want to compare. (I
retained the other freezer improvements, so it wouldn't just be bug
fixes against your patches).
Regards,
Nigel
