Thanks Lee. Yes I was pretty excited with those reports too (I've been
lurking on LKML :), but I just seem to be unlucky. That's why I've been
trying one by one of the patches, from Q5 to R6 and tweaking the available
options as much as I know and time permitted.
OK, could just someone with a P4 HT/SMP box hand me their working kernel
.config file for me to try? That could be a good starting point, if not a
plain baseline.

On this box in question, softirq and hardirq-preempt options had NEVER
lead to a stable SMP/HT system, ever since my first rehearsal with VP,
which I think was around O3. UP is quite different, it works and always
worked, as advertised :) FWIW, R6 is pumping hard on my laptop :)
Q3-SMP doesn't pass the KDE 3.3 startup splash if I set softirq=1 or
hardirq=1. The system just hangs. I still keep softirq-preempt=0 and
hardirq-preempt=0 as my Q3-SMP kernel bootloader parameters though.
Hope this gets cleared out. All I can do is offering my best efforts to
dig this out, provided someone give me some hunch ;)
Thank you all.
