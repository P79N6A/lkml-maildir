This seems somewhat related to one of my peeves, namely that a newbie
recompiling the kernel can wipe out his modules directory WAY to easily.
(Yes, it happened to me a few times before I figured out what was wrong.)  A
(default?) option to generate extraversion-type information in order to
prevent overwriting previous results would avoid this.  Kernel hackers would
turn it off almost as a matter of course, but someone wanting to rebuild the
kernel with the latest gcc might find this a lifesaver.
