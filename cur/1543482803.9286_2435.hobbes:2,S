Subject: BUG: NFS - File is a directory.

Using knfsd-981204 with kernel 2.2.0pre8, on rare occasions the NFS
server gets "confused" and reports that a file is a
directory. Unmounting the NFS fs and remounting it solves the problem,
but this just shouldn't happen. This is happening with a Solaris 2.5.1
client, but some of my users have reported this with a like configured
linux client. 
I'm willing to test patches etc. If anyone has any ideas. I am
subscribed to the list, but would appreciate cc's as it will bring it
to my attention.
Thank you.
