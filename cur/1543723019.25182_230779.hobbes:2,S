No, I think we get to this on the non-NAPI route as well. The ->poll
check keeps us from filtering twice.

Let's explicitly return 1.

Yes. Let's make that NETPOLL_RX_DROP to disambiguate the
trapped/dropped-for-polling. And we can do a simple
increment/decrement on trapped itself - but do we still need it here
now that we've shorted out the NAPI path with RX_DROP?
There might be some new atomicity or memory barrier issues here, be
mindful.

It doesn't really make sense for trapped to be non-global - it means
the machine is in polling-only mode, eg debugger or the like. It's
rather misusing it to kill the NAPI receive side for netpoll_poll.
