Hello Alan, all:
With 2.4.21-ac1, my cmd680 is detected with a base clock
o1 100, instead of 133 whict, I think, as it should be.
The card is an ata133 raid card. In my earlier tries with
mandrake's 2.4.21-pre4q13, the base clock was reported
correctly. The hard disk attached to is a udma100 one, yes,
but I think "base clock" is supposed to report the capability
of the controller not the drive (I may be wrong of course).
Lspci reports the card as:
00:0a.0 RAID bus controller: CMD Technology Inc PCI0680 (rev 02)
