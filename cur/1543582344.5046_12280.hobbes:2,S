Hi all,
This is an typical mail from an experienced user-land programmer who wants to 
help in kernel development ;D. 
I've been lurking for a while in this list and I'm wondering if this is the 
right list for asking stupid newbie questions. Is it?. If not, do you know 
one?. Where I can find documentation? (yeah, yeah, read the code. But
things are always better with an 'vi   Doc.txt' in the processes tree :)
Thanks!
Pedro
