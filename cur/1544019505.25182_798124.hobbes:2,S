C-like, allowing C or assembly implementations of calls.  Currently
several of the most important calls have a restricted clobber set,
however, and since it's clear there aren't any forthcoming new
implementations of a VMI ROM, it might be better to go with the actual
clobbers for performance critical ops.

ecx, edx

Enable/Disable have no clobbers at all.
Save clobbers only return value, %eax
Restore also clobbers nothing.
The patching code has gotten quite complex with the 32/64 union; let me
apply it first and see before I comment on the patch.
