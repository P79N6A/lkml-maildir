This is a nice little writeup, maybe it could go into the kernel's 
Documentation/ directory?  It would be nice to document how the lock 
and signal handling interact as well.

Sounds interesting, but that would be card specific, right?  I mean, on 
some cards the 2d and 3d locks would have to be the same because of 
shared state or whatever, for example.
