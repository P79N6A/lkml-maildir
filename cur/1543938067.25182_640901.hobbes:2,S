I don't suppose you're suggesting this will make a big difference.  Even
if every exec did nothing but immediately exit, it still wouldn't make
much difference.
Likewise, I take your point about proper iBCS support (and I suppose
it's really iBCS2 that we're talking about.)  My concern is that
removing this now gains almost nothing, 2 strcmp per exec is as close to
nothing as anything, but it sends a message with which I disagree.  The
message should be that Linux is good for, well the same things FreeBSD
is, and includes running Solaris and SCO binaries.  This is a major
simplification of the story, I know, but still hits the plot highlights.
