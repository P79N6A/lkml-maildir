Hi,
Just one more crazy idea ...
Have you thought about cooperating with some kind of commercial company? 
ie. SiS tried/is trying  to create a 3D GPU without much success ... but 
they might be able to help manufacturing GPUs/Cards even in bigger 
series and as long as they dont have to invest too much in development 
and get some income i think they can do it. And as far as i know a lot 
of windows users would appreciate opensource graphics cores because of 
the advantages of opensource drivers. I would also say that there would 
be enough people interested in writing drivers for windows so your card 
could be generally very well marketable. I know this is not windows 
mailng list, but speaking of marketability of the core windows has the 
greates market share and having it working in windows too would mean 
that you are getting at production quotes big enough for reaching low 
prices. So why not "abuse" windows to get us a good GPU?
