Horst, give him a fscking credit, after all! RTFS _really_ applies to both
sides. Get a friggin' clue already. _If_ one is going to implement such
things at all he will not mess with chmod(1). ->notify_change() is your
friend. And CODA's. Please, stop playing idiot, you've already done it in
very convincing way. If you are trying to outperform Shawn - take this
pissing contest to email, OK?
