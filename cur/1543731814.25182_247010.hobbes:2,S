I went over the code but at a first glance couldn't find a notorius 
trouble spot. I don't have big-endian hardware myself so this is hard to 
test.
Just a few questions to help me out in finding the problem:
- is this really an endianess problem or is it a 64-bit integer problem?
- are you cross compiling the kernel?
Thanks in advance,
