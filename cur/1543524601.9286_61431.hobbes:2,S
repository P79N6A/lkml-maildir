Linux 2.3.41 seems to have a new characteristic which makes interactive
performance poor.
A telnet session with a host in my office, connected through a private
hub, shows a noticeable delay in character echo when interacting with
the host.
Executing `vi` shows the delay to be so bad that escape-sequences
time-out if, for instance it's in `insert` mode, and I use the arrow
keys.
Benchmarks of streaming data look fine. It's the character I/O that
has suffered miserably. I haven't got the time (need a work-break)
to check tcpdump's output, but perhaps somebody else can experiment
and see what's going on.
A preminary check seems to indicate that the network is okay. It looks
as though there has been some kind of delay added when using virtual
terminals (perhaps buffering has changed). I guess this because
telnet to the echo port shows no visible delay. It's only when an
interactive session is established, which use virtual terminals, that
the delay becomes obvious.
Cheers,
