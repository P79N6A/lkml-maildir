It's about the frequency of the feedback loop. As we have much lower
latency with P-state transitions, the sampling time can be order of
millisecond (or shorter if meaningful). A userland daemon can have a
high-level policy (preferences, or set of parameters), but it cannot be
part of the real feedback loop. If we combine P-state transitions and
deeper C-state transitions, the situation is worse with a userland
daemon.
