nobody is hitting the problems because if this problem triggers the
machine starts slowly swapping and shrinking the vfs and it eventually
relocate the highmem. the crpilling down of the vfs caches as well isn't
a good thing and it will not be noticeable by anybody.
If they would be truly running without swap they would be hitting these
problems very fast. But everybody has swap.
