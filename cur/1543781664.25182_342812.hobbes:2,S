Note that it's racy vs. removal of devices, but I suspect a good bunch
of the PCI code is. The whole idea that list*_safe routines pay you
anything in that regard need to be shot. Afaik, they are only safe about
the caller removing the current element.
I wonder if it's finally time to implement proper race free list
iterators in the kernel. Not that difficult... A small struct iterator
with a list head and the current elem pointer, and the "interated" list
containing the list itself, a list of iterators and a lock. Iterators
can then be "fixed" up on element removal with a fine grained lock on
list structure access.
