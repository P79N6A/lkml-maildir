Subject: [PATCH] sched: fix never executed code due to expression always false
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/14/188

There are two expressions in kernel/sched.c that are always false since 
they test for <0 but the result of the expression is unsigned so they will 
never be less than zero. This patch implement the logic that I believe is 
intended without the signedness issue and without the nasty casts.
<disclaimer>patch is compile tested only</disclaimer>
