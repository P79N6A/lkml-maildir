It is both a motherboard (bios actually) and cpu issue.

I have a P4 2.8GHz which does do HT.  It is family 15, model 2, stepping
9.  Stepping 7 is probably from just before intel started enabling HT
support.  The P4A Northwood did not have HT and came in 1.6 to 2.8GHz
(400FSB).  The P4B Northwood did have HT on the 3.06Ghz model only and
came in 2.0 to 3.06Ghz (533FSB).  The P4C Northwood had HT and came
in 2.4 to 3.4GHz (800FSB).  I have the P4C 2.8GHz which is showing as
model 2 stepping 9.

Who wants to buy a power wasting P4 now, when they can instead get the
Core 2 or an Athlon 64 which run faster using less power?

So this is a model 2 stepping 9 just as my P4 is and HT works just like
my P4 does.
I can't actually find a list that says when stepping had what feature
enabled.
