Its -o wsync in XFS.  This is the IRIX way, anyway - from a bit of
man page reading.  We should be stitching that into -o sync a bit
better in XFS.  The combination of -o wsync,sync should get you the
equivalent behaviour at the moment though, I think.

Try using -o wsync for your tests, I'll look into our interpretation
of -o sync in XFS in the meantime.
cheers.
