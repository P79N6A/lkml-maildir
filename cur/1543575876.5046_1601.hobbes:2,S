I'm afraid I won't be able to answer this question, since I'm leaving for
a 3-week vacation in about 50 minutes and I need my firewall functional
until then. :-) Maybe other people who have seen this problem can
experiment further.
If I get a few moments, I'll do a quick test before leaving and will let
you know. The chance of that happening is extremely slim, though.
Thanks,
Ion
