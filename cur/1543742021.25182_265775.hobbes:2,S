just to make sure - could try to run kudzu manually after bootup and
observe what happens? Do you have a udev based system? I recently
corrupted my udev database via a crash and had to remove the
/dev/.udev.tdb file and had to regenerate it via 'udevstart'. (be
careful doing that though, it might mess up your system.) The symtoms
were a hung kudzu - while in reality it 'hung' because udev and udevinfo
processes looped in userspace forever. Weirdly, the stock Fedora kernel
didnt hang in this same phase, so there might still be a
PREEMPT_REALTIME bug here.
