I think that the important thing to remember is that these tools are 
already broken; they just don't know it.  It is better to tell the tools 
you don't know the geometry than to make something up which won't work 
for its intended purpose.
In some cases the tools still require this information but don't really 
need it at all ( like dosemu ) so they really need to be fixed.  It is 
silly to require a lie that you don't even use.
