Hi!
I'm probably doing something wrong, but... how do I force it to work?
I'm pretty sure it worked before, I'm not sure what changed in my
config.
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux$ make C=2
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHECK   scripts/mod/empty.c
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CHECK   init/main.c
include/linux/kernel.h:10:11: error: unable to open 'stdarg.h'
