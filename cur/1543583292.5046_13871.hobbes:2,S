So... you can access things under /home/david, but you cannot access
/home/david itself?
So, supposing that "fred" were some file that you happen to know is
in /home/david, then
    ls /home/david             fails with ESTALE and does not cause
			       any traffic to the server and
    ls -l /home/david/fred     succeeds.
Is that right?
Could you try:
  echo 255 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug 
and then do the "ls /home/david" and see what gets put in 
/var/log/messages (or kern_log or syslog or where such things go).
