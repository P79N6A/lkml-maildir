The klibc-integrated git tree is at:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/hpa/linux-2.6-klibc.git
At this point, the big thing is to drop this into as many 
weirdly-booting Linux setups as possible, and watch them hopefully have 
no effect whatsoever :)
For porting klibc, I have a set of tests which are also included. 
Unfortunately, they're not currently self-validating, which would be a 
significant enhancement.
