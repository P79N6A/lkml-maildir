Thanks!

That's great. However, this depends on Linus merging my patch. And it may
well be (and I even suggest this) that he takes Russell King's pcmcia/cardbus 
patches first.
The actual changes (in this step of getting rid of cardmgr) are quite few,
the larger ones will follow later:
there's a register_pccard_driver() call and a register_pccard_driver
somewhere in the pcmcia drivers. forget the first parameter (&dev_info most
of the time), the second one becomes the .attach call, the third one the
.detach call in a 
static struct pcmcia_driver dummy_driver = {
	.drv = {
		.name	= "dummy_cs",
	},
	.attach		= dummy_attach,
	.detach		= dummy_detach,
	.owner		= THIS_MODULE,
};
Then replace the {un,}register_pccard_driver() with
pcmcia_{un,}register_driver(&dummy_driver), respectively.
A sample conversion for the drivers/net/pcmcia/pcnet_cs.c driver can be
found within the patch you replied to, btw.
