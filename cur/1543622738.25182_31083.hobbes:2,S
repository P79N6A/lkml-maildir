As stated above, I allocate a kernel object <kulock_t> on demand and
hash it. This way I don't have to pin any user address. What does everybody
think about the merit of this approach versus the pinning approach?
Most importantly I think the merit of both approaches stems from the fact
that the access is purely through the userlevel address rather than
through a handle. In your case, can the lock be allocated at different
virtual addresses in the various address spaces.
How do you cleanup ? Do you search through the hashtable ? In other words
what happens if you SIGTERM a process ?

One more syscall its all that needed like semop(). I multiplex all operations
through this interface. Agree, its more scalable then a device driver as
somebody pointed out that the device has locks associated with it.

That's what I have done. All internal objects are created on the fly.
Somebody pointed out to me that RT programs might want to allocate the 
internal object apriori, in that case the forcing the creation would be
required.

Yip, no state sharing required between kernel and user. I analyzed this 
vary carefully, particularly for spinning locks, I can show you sequences
of events that get you in real trouble because the atomic update in user
space and the waiting are non atomic. As far as I am concerned separation
is imperative.

No, you effectively need two queues or you have to basically replicate
the low level semaphore routines to walk the list and identify the
sequence (R*W)* and only wake those up that are the same. There are many
issues in the wakeup. Do I want to wakeup all readers waiting regardless
of intermittent writers....

This is a must. I talked to database folks, they can see huge utilization
out of these locks. I hence echo again Ben LaHaises opinion, the kernel
mechanism must be flexible enough to support more complex locking stuff.
I have added in my next update on lse download support for queues.

Indeed this is/was a lifesaver, it points out so many interesting things
with respect to bugs and performance when the rubber hits the road.

Let's keep the sync going. At this point we need to figure out what
is the right approach for the kernel. Is the explicite kernel object 
approach I have chosen better/worse/equal to the pinning approach ?
Inputs from everyone please. We need to score against
	codepath length, 
	cleanup, 
	memory requirements
