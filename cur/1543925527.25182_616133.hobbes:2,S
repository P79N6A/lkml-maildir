This happened second time, now with 2.6.24-rc2. I have kpowersave configured
to initiate suspend-to-disk on low battery. Suspend-to-disk is initiated,
but system stops after Suspending console line. Suspend image is not created.
This did work before although I do not name exact version.
I am rather at loss how to proceed further ... any idea? dmesg and config
attached just in case. The problem is that hibernation works when I initiate
it manually ...
