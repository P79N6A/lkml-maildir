The specification did not take that in to account. The Bus/Dev/Func 
information is only present there - no domain information.
Do you think I should implement a search functionality for this so that is 
searches through the domains for the bus/dev/func and picks the 
first found match (which might be the wrong match)? Or wait to get the spec
updated so that the iBFT will have this data?
