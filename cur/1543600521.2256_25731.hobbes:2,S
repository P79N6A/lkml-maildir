The alloc_dmap code returns -ENOMEM when the allocation fails. That causes
the open_dmap call to return -ENOMEM which in turn causes DMAbuf_open
to return -ENOMEM which causes audio_openb to return -ENOMEM, which gets
back to userspace. 
I don't see a problem.
[sound btw also supports a module option to keep the dmabuffers allocated
 once and hang onto them]
