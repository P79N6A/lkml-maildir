Reading it again I wasn't all too clear in that last posting - I meant
it to show two alternatives (eth<i> stays with bus vs. eth<i> stays
with card). Each with its own advantages and disadvantages; I don't
have a fixed preference, but a slight leaning towards fixed
bus-position based numbers (spanning different drivers, if at all
possible). That would allow Xavier's scenario even with a different
type of replacement card.
(Yes of course you'd have to reconfig to swap a PCI card for an ISA
one but let's not go there, OK?)
So long,
