Not true. Your project has just finished it first stable 
release. Its just we are going commerical with this product.
We even have a modified distro to handle such a system. 
Yes you have to do special modifications to make 
multi-desktop systems work.

   It has been done. I have a system at home running a 
multi-desktop system. I have a 2 user system and my 
partner in code developement, Aivil, has a 3 person
multi-desktop system working. 
   Now that we have a working product we can go to the 
next stage. Finding customers to sell it to. This weekend
I'm getting together with a few sales guys to discuss this.
   As for the potential of this. Its large. With Gnome/KDE
and OpenOffice running for 3,4 or more people at the same
time out of one box will be a enormous cost reducer for 
any business. You coudl even do Wine to run MS apps but I 
don't know what the legal ramifactions of that would be.
As a business we wouldn't do it out of fear of being sued.
    The next stage will be non PC boards supporting more than
one graphics display output. Every now and then you see such a
board. I seen a 8 graphics chip board with 8 video outputs. 
Embedded devices that open like a wallet with a display on each 
side. Multiuser game consoles would be really cool. Its going to 
be a fun future.
