How do you know this? How can I learn what Windows does with
Win/2000/professional? The only way I know I have two CPUs is when the
machine fails to reboot because the file-system has been completely
trashed by the two CPUs banging on it at the same time. The solution has
been to remove one CPU. M$ claims; "Windows will over-power the system
if two CPUs are present...." Direct quote. If you have two logical
CPUs, you can't remove one, therefore, unless M$ has fixed the problem(s)
in XP, you can't use Windows with two logical CPUs, i.e., hyperthreading.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.18 on an i686 machine (797.90 BogoMips).
Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
