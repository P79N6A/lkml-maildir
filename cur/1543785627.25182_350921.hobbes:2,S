Well, you won't like this example any better, then, but this was a
frequently reported GDB bug for a while:
const int x;
int main()
{
  *x = 1;
  return 0;
}
x goes in rodata -> text segment -> on the same page as main.  If you
run to main in GDB, the page becomes writable.  The store doesn't
crash.  If you run it out of GDB, it crashes.
Sure, the trivial example's uninteresting.  But you can construct a
larger example with, say, *foo() = x replaced by *foo = x.  That's not
legal in C for a function foo, of course.  But you could probably
manage it in some other language, or in asm.  So you debug right around
where you're getting a crash in your application, and it doesn't crash.
Ptrace needs to be as unintrusive as possible.  Having the page COW
unexpectedly is a lot less bad than having it COW _and_ remain
writable.
