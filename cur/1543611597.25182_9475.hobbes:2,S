Please ignore these for now as the code isn't in the tree either.  For
the time being it would be more correct to comment out the config
questions.

Once again:
Motorola releases microcode updates for their 8xx CPM modules.  The
microcode update file has updates for IIC, SMC and USB.  Currently only
the USB update is available by default, if the MPC8xx USB option is
enabled.  If in doubt, say 'N' here.
And yes, the USB driver isn't in the tree yet either.
