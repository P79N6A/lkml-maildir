Beg to differ, and differ big time. 
You want to avoid the kernel for _Latency_ reasons. Bandwidth isnt the
issue since a syscall doing DMA to user space is the sme data copy rate.
Its when you get tons of small messages you want user mode hooks - things
like U-Net.

You are priming the cache. I can well believe it. In networking  I saw
bizzare artifacts like that - like where a 1500 byte packet copy into
an sk_buff if you avoided it and went direct to user space was no
different in cost.
