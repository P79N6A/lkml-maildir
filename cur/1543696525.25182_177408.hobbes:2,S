I don't like this idea for the following reason:
A -rc kernel of a stable series needs maximum testing to avoid any 
regressions compared to the previous stable kernel.
If you start a new -pre series at the time of an -rc series many people 
will use the new -pre instead of the latest -rc decreasing the number of 
people testing this -rc and therefore increasing the risk of problems in 
the final kernel.
