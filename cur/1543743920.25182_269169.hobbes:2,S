Hi,
I'm working with an old data acquisition system that uses an 8-bit card
in an ISA slot (address 0xd0000), by a simple driver I ported from
kernel 1.1.x to 2.2.24.
It works fine, but I'd like to have features by newer kernels (2.4 or
even 2.6), like new filesystems support.
On kernels >=2.4.0 check_region returns -EBUSY for that address,
but it is not actually used; I tried to understand if something has been
changed/removed, because of obsolescence of devices, in IO management,
but I couldn't.
Does anybody have any explanation/suggestion?
Thank you
Best Regards,
Antonino Sergi
