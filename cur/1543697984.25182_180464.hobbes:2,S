Hi !
I've switched to 2.6.0-test11, and was pleasantly surprised that 
suspend-to-ram / suspend-to-disk (Patrick's version) works very well. 
It even somewhat fixes (by initialising properly on resume) troubles with 
miniPCI 3c556 NIC.
(bug #1188 in bugzilla). One problem (not a showstopper, but somewhat 
annoying) is audio device driver failing to resume correctly from STR. No 
oops, but no sound after resume either, until sound driver is 
rmmoded/insmoded.
relevant messages in dmesg:
Nov 28 02:02:48 localhost kernel: ALSA sound/pci/cs46xx/cs46xx_lib.c:1420: 
open front channel                                
Nov 28 02:02:58 localhost kernel: ALSA sound/core/pcm_native.c:1267: playback 
drain error (DMA or IRQ trouble?)              
for ALSA driver and
Nov 28 10:50:00 localhost kernel: cs46xx: drain_dac, dma timeout? 1034
for OSS. 
With APM this feature worked corectly. 
I've looked briefly into the driver code (cs46xx_lib.c), but quickly realised 
I'm not knowledgeable enough to try to fix the problem. I've tried to 
reproduce initialisation sequence (by copypasting relevant code from 
snd_cs46xx_create to snd_cs46xx_resume), but without success.
