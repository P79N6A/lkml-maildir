I think you would have to use mprotect(,,PROT_NONE), set the region to
disallow read/write, and then each SEGV would have to be decoded, and
the trap told to continue as though the access did take place.
Take a look at the mprotect man page for an example, and then sigaction
arount the siginfo_t area.  in siginfo_t.si_addr it gives the address
that faulted.
