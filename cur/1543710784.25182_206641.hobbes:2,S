marcelo-
i think at this point the problem is:
the devices in question do NOT end on a page boundary.  readahead is
scheduling reads by page rather than by sector, so when the device ends in
the middle of a page, it causes some buffers to be scheduled past the end
of such a device.
for example, if the device is exactly 15 1K sectors long, readahead will
schedule a page read from 12K to 16K.  when it gets to that last 1K
sector, the buffer layer complains that someone is trying to read past the
end of the device.  with the old readahead logic, readahead would stop
short of the last page, so it couldn't trigger this problem.
can anyone confirm or deny this analysis?
if there isn't an easy solution to this, i suggest we simply use your
one-line fix and forget about the uncoalesced read problem in 2.4.  in
2.6, the readahead algorithm is entirely replaced, and i don't think this
is an issue.
