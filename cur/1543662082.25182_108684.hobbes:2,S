Hi all,
The following patch adds two missing includes for the r8169.c driver, which
without, prevented compilation.  The problem was discovered on an alpha.
It compiles, but as I have no hardware to test with I cannot test whether
it works.
The patch is against marcelo's 2.4.21-pre4, status for 2.5 is unknown.
