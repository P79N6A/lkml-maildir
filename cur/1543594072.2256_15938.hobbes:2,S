Hello!
I got plenty of replies. Thanks. Playing with
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_thresh{2,3} helped. The funny thing
is that there are no more ENOBUFS problems - I am guessing that in
2.2.19 buffer of TCP is bigger than in 2.4.x, or something...
People asked me about more details of oopses I had with 2.4.5. Sorry I
don't have any data that could help and I won't try 2.4.x again, until 2.4.20 comes out :)
Andi Kleen said that my problems with 2.4.x and ENOBUFS should be fixed
after changing some things in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem, net/core/[rw]mem_{max,default}.
Thank you once again :)
