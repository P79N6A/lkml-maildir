The attached changelog describes what I just pushed out to BitKeeper 
(and what should be appearing in the next -mm release from Andrew).
Note to BK users:  please re-clone netdev-2.6, don't just 'bk pull'.
Most of this is simply stuff that is "hanging out for a while" in 
netdev-2.6 while it -- hopefully -- gets testing and review.  All of 
these changes are bound for upstream eventually.
Note on wireless:  HostAP and Vladmir's effort to make 802.11 a "real" 
Linux network protocol both seem to have stagnated a bit.  I'm still 
hoping that
* Intel will appear with a patch that merges their drivers
* some magical engineering force will start using the HostAP code as 
common library code in other drivers (notably Intel)
* Vladmir or someone will continue Vladmir's work to integrate wireless 
more closely with the Linux network stack
