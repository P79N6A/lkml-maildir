While I agree with your sentiments that userspace can have a good idea on
how to deal with the page cache, your program does more than it claims to
do - because of how linux implements posix_fadvise.
I don't think anybody expects or desires your program to actually *evict*
the stuff from the cache you are trying access, which happens in case the
data was in the cache prior to starting your program.
What people expect is that a solution such as you wrote it simply won't
*add* anything to the cache. They don't expect it will actually globally
*remove* stuff from the cache.
Making a backup this way would hurt even worse than usual with your
pagecache management tool if the file being backupped was still being read.
This is not your fault, but in practice, it makes your program less useful
than it could be.
One could conceivably fix that up using mincore and simply not fadvise if a
page was in core already.
