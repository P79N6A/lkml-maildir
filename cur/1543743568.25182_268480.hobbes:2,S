Ah, yeah, getprocattr, not the stacker setprocattr, sorry.  For quick
testing, something like that is sufficient.  But for longterm it's got
to be less hackish.

Right now it's just per-module files.  The latter adds extra expense per
fork that would be nice to avoid.  Could be a sort of transaction file,
write the pid, get back the assoiciated data, and thus be static with
the directory.
