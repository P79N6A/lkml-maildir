Hi,

Of course, it is interesting to run x11perf*(1) and analyze the output.
However, in very practical concrete sense, I am running an OpenGL-based
solar system simulator (ssystem) and seeing a huge fps improvement added
by MTRRs on a system almost identical to yours - about 20-30% speed
improvement. (the 2.5x improvement claimed in the docs is if all you do is
bitblt-ing your stuff without doing any calculations, whilst "real-world"
apps spend most of the time multiplying matrices and calculating
sin()/cos() (unless they are so clever as to use pre-calculated tables))
Regards,
Tigran.
