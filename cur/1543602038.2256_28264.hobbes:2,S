I've been trying to get dynamic loading on the Linux/VAX project going,
and I've having trouble with the Global Offset Table and how it magically
gets in to the ebx register on x86.. where is this done?
I think I've looked at the kernel, gcc, binutils, ld.so 1.9, glibc 2.2.3
and can't see exactly where this happens...
Anyone care to enlighten my poor brain...
Thanks,
	Dave.
