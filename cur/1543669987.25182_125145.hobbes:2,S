Based only on the data from the fragment above, your relative percentage
of time spent breaks down like this (I'm using the 1st column):
	46%	__generic_copy_to_user (2604 / 5650)
	30%	csum_partial_copy_generic (1705 / 5650)
	13%	do_anonymous_page (764 / 5650)
	 6%	__generic_copy_from_user (370 / 5650)
Whatever you were doing when you collected this profile, your system was
spending roughly 76% of the time copying data from kernel space to user
space.
I can't tell you why it was doing that; for some applications this may
be expected and normal.  I don't find the "load" column all that useful
myself -- others will certainly differ.
Regards,
Andy
