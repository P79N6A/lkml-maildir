But what graphics resources does the LPP require?  If it's more restricted than 
the current Linux boot process it affects server-oriented machines that aren't 
running X or graphics, that just serve resources on the net.
I'd not like to see the minimum bar for hardware compatibility raised without 
very good cause.  Boot time messages aren't a good cause for me. YMMV.
My feeling: At best it should be an option only, and default to no LPP.
