that's more a band-aid than a fix (I can imagine a userspace hang if the
device isn't created for whatever reason), if there's no way to do
better than this if you've to run fsck (or if it's not the best to run
the fsck inside the dev.d scripts), then probably this needs better
fixing. is such a big problem to execute a sys_wait4 to wait the udev
userspace to return before returning from the insmod syscall?
