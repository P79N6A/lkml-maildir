Hi Matthew,
I worked on some thing similar. For one of our customer product that 
goes to defense and security markets, we had to support maximum possible 
memory test. We implemented a mechanism of pre-test to test the memory 
with walking 1's and 0's just before Linux kernel starts allocating 
serious memory for its use. That way, coverage was almost 99%. Once 
Linux boots, we do a very through test using various algorithms, however 
as you said coverage of memory is little less when we test the system 
after Linux boots up completely.
memtest86+ started as a very good alternative, until customer's customer 
started complaining about memory issues. Then we had no choice but to 
take this route and implement it ourselves from the scratch.
If you want 100% coverage, it may not be possible unless you do it in 
BIOS early on. If you take the route of implementing some simple memory 
test in Linux kernel before it starts allocating memory, you get very 
good % of coverage. Good Luck.

Yes this is to improve the efficiency of server burn-ins.  I would
consider a kernel module, but I still wouldn't be able to test the
memory in which the kernel is sitting, which is my problem.  I'm not
sure even a kernel module could reliably test the memory in which it is
residing (memtest86+ relocates itself to do this).  Also I don't see how
  userspace testing is any less thorough than doing it in the kernel; I
just need a creative way of accessing every single page of memory.
 
I may do some experiments with the memmap args, some bad RAM and
shuffling it between DIMM sockets when I have the time :)
