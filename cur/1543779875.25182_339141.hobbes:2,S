Does your machine enter C3 state? Check the usage
in /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
If usage is 0, unplug all USB peripherals (at least those connected to
uhci controllers). Also shut down sound servers.
Without C3, there won't be any power savings from lower HZ. Desktop CPUs
often don't support C3 at all.
