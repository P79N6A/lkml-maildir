The "/proc/iomem" records information of all memory regions including
"normal RAM" and all kinds of reserved regions, which is backed by
iomem_resource. On x86_64, it is initialized in the exact same way as
nosave region initialization.
I think maybe we can replace the "nosave region" concepts with
"iomem_resource" (maybe need some enhancement).
