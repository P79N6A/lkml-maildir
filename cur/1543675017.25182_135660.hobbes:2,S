The compressed caching code isn't yet properly preempt aware. The filesystems 
that are safe are just lucky.

The default in -ck7 is lzo which is the best compression and pretty fast. The 
full details only RCastro can tell us.

Definitely with the default VM as the basis in 2.4 (as opposed to AA or RMAP) 
you are much better off without High Mem enabled if you only have 1Gb.
