You won't give this capability to all processes.  Unless PR_SET_KEEPCAPS
is set changing the uid of the process will drop all capabilities.  This
option is then also the only way to pass capabilities to a non-root process.
You can further limit the capability inheritance by removing a capability from
the inherited set.
