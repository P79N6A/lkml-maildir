   Linus' apparently did not understand this, or he would have
   immediately realized that double locking was always generating a
   second non-cacheable memory reference for every lock being taken
   and released.
Jeff, after working together with Linus for 6 or so years myself, I
would make a large wager that Linus understands these issues much
better than even you.
But then again, as previously stated, I don't take you very seriously,
but I fear that there are a few on this list who still do.
