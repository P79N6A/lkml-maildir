Add to  that, that  more and more  devices and  gadgets have a  USB or
IEEE1394 interface, and new laptops have these versatile ports.
BTW, is  there *still* any technical  advantage of PCMCIA  over USB or
1394?  (e.g. I know that USB pre 2.0 didn't have DMA and the interrupt
model  is inferior.   That's why  PCMCIA 100BaseT  Ethernet  cards are
superior to USB<-->Fast Ethernet bridges.)
