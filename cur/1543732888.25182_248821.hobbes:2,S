I was only mimicing the support currently in the arm led code.
After thinking about it from a broader perspective of including GPIOs,
we should probably get rid of this function thing entirely.  Just let user  
space do everything... userspace can monitor sysfs and hotplug and have the  
led represent power or idle or whatever.

depends on the hardware...
The led class does not really inforce any policy, it just passes this
number along to the actual driver that is registered.  So say you had
a led that could be red, green, or both red and green at the same time
(not sure how that would work hardware wise, but ok).  The driver could
do something like set color="red/green/red&green" and then use 0,1,2,3.
The kernel is just reflecting the possible states the hardware could be
in.
