I was planning on sending FUSE into Linus in a week or two.  That and
cpusets are the notable features which are 2.6.12 candidates.
- crashdump seems permanently not-quite-ready
- perfctr works fine, but is rather deadlocked because it is
  similar-to-but-different-from ia64's perfmon, and might not be suitable
  for ppc64 (although things have gone quiet on the latter front).
- nfsacl should be OK for 2.6.12 if Trond is OK with it.
- cachefs is a bit stuck because it's a ton of complex code and afs is
  the only user of it.  Wiring it up to NFS would help.
- dm multipath is OK for 2.6.12
- reiser4 is less clear.  Once all the review comments have been addressed
  and we start seeing a bit of vendor pull for it, maybe.
