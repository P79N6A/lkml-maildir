The box I'm seeing this on has a single inet interface "eth0,"
which is connected to LAN.
	# ip addr add 172.27.0.1/16 brd + dev eth0 label eth0:1
	$ nmap -sP -T Insane '172.27.*.*'
There are no live addresses from the 172.27.0.0/16 range on the LAN.
After about a minute into the ping sweep, nmap starts printing messages like:
	Strange read error from 172.27.4.26: Transport endpoint is not connected
	Strange read error from 172.27.4.27: Transport endpoint is not connected
	Strange read error from 172.27.4.28: Transport endpoint is not connected
	...
and dmesg reveals these errors:
	Neighbour table overflow.
	NET: 46 messages suppressed.
	...
Then, trying to issue a simple "ping 172.27.5.5" results in:
	connect: No buffer space available
I'm unable to reproduce the problem with a 2.4 kernel.
