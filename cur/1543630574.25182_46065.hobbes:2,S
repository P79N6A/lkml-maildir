Hi,
i had a few problems with the 3c59x driver over the last
few days.
I have a
00:0a.0: 3Com PCI 3c905C Tornado at 0xd800.
Which has been working fine for a few months.
i updated the kernel to 2.4.19-pre8 for
the ide promise ata/133 card.
no problem works fine.
So the 3c59x.c card was working to
though it did have a bad performance problem.
looking at ifconfig said it had alot of tx carrier
errors (70% of packets ) becaus i had moved the machine etc..
i check the cables etc.. all seem fine.
so i dropped the driver back to the one in 2.4.18 and all
seems fine again.
anyone any ideas ?
