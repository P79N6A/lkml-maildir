Can we make this somewhat less cumbersome even by say, allowing
developers to file a gpg key and sign a certificate saying "all patches
that I sign with that key are hereby under this regime". I know you hate
it but the FSF copyright assignment stuff at least has such "do it once
for forever" mechanism making the pain optionally only once.
