Unknown linux kernel command line arguments are passed through as arguments to
init, unless they have a period in them.

I'm trying to run a shell script inside User Mode Linux.  I have an init
wrapper that forks and attaches the child process to /dev/tty0, then waits for
the child to exit.  (I need to do this for ctrl-c to work, pid 1 has kill
blocked and /dev/console has no controlling tty.)  This wrapper uses the
standard execvp(argv[1],argv+1) trick from detach/nohup/setsid and so on.
It worked until I tried to run the production shell script, the name of which
includes the build stage (which has a period in it), and like all the build
shell scripts it ends in .sh.  I get this:
  UML running in SKAS0 mode
  Checking PROT_EXEC mmap in /tmp...OK
  Unknown boot option
    `/home/landley/newbuild/firmware-build/sources/scripts/1.0-tools-umlsetup.sh':
    ignoring
  System halted.
Which sucks.
