1) The user stack could be invalid.  An invalid stack in the kernel will 
cause the processor to double fault (see the recent double fault thread).
2) Security.  You could set up the stack pointer from userspace so that 
the kernel would overwrite memory that userspace can't access.
3) Security #2.  You don't want to give userspace access to certain data 
written to the stack in kernel mode.
