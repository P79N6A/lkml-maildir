This looks exactly like what I was looking for.  I think I misunderstood
your original description, which is why it is always best to communicate
ideas using patches :)
My misunderstanding what that I thought that your flag would work
like this:
1) input interrupt occurs, flag is set
2) IRQ handling completes
3) some new IRQ arrives, and this is when we test
   the flag for dumping sysrq regs
That, fortunately, is not what your patch is doing.

I rather believe it is for vm86 IRQ handling.
