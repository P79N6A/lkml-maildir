Yes, this is the hard part IMO, because it should be done in a way
that when FUSE wants a new writable page and it's over the limit, it
should block until it goes under the limit.  Not trivial at all.

Tell the page cache it's never going to get cleaned, but call the
writepage() anyway.  It's sort of splitting the bdi->memory_backed
flag into two: dont_count_as_dirty and dont_writeback.  Ramfs, etc
would set both, FUSE would set only dont_count_as_dirty.  See what I'm
thinking of?

That's not a problem.

Yes, this would be a nice interface.  How would you solve the problem
of freeing the space which is no longer needed?
Imagine that you have a 4G virtual file on a FUSE filesystem, and some
process is reading that file sequentially.  But there's only 10MByte
of free space on the local disk.  With the above method you'd never be
able to read the whole file.  Do you see the problem?
