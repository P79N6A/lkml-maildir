You may have a point but device drivers are a piss-poor example.  Say
Linux does take over the world, and eepro100 continues to lock up under
load.  Who loses?  Intel.  People will quit buying their motherboards
and PCI cards.  So for whom is it worth spending corporate dollars
fixing eepro100?  Again, Intel.  If word were to get out "avoid Intel
network cards, the driver is crap", you can bet they will fix it.
If this hasn't happened yet, it's because Intel doesn't see enough
market in Linux to bother.  And if so, so what?  There are plenty of
motherboards with pcnet32 and 3c9xx chips.
