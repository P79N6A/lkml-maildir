As far as I know, I made it up.  It seemed appropriate, since the first 
header applies to the entire group of three routines that follow whereas 
the second header is kerneldoc just for the next function.

In principle we could replace blocking notifiers, but in practice we
can't.
We can't just substitute one for the other for two reasons: SRCU notifiers
need special initialization which the blocking notifiers don't have, and
SRCU notifiers have different time/space tradeoffs which might not be
appropriate for all existing blocking notifiers.
