the whole compilation (gcc tasks) will be rated 'interactive' as well,
because an 'interactive' make process and/or shell process is waiting on
it. I tried something like this before, and it didnt work.

the xine has been analyzed quite well (which is analogous to the XMMS
problem), it's not X that makes XMMS skip, it's the other CPU-bound tasks
on the desktops that cause it to skip occasionally. Increasing the
priority of xine to just -1 or -2 solves the skipping problem.
