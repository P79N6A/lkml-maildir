How is this supposed to work? You can set debug registers via ptrace().
So A is ptracing B and sets up breakpoints in B. Now, if B forks C,
C inherits the breakpoints of B. But what about the ptracing and re-parenting
that is associated with this? If A does not know about C, I wonder how this
could be work and be useful?

I did not keep track but thanks or this update. That's great!
