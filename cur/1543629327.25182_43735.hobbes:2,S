Hello,
I recently upgraded to YDL 2.2 (from LinuxPPC2K-Q4) and Kernel 2.4.18.
The computer is a PowerMac 8500 (circa 1995).
I found a bug in the controlfb.c file for the kernel.
(/usr/src/linux-2.4.18/drivers/video/controlfb.c)
The kernel commandline video options ("video=controlfb:vmode:17" for
example) do not work.
The routine "control_setup" reads the commandline correctly and sets
"default_vmode".
The problem is in the routine "init_control".
It does not use "default_vmode" to set "vmode".
(The exception is when there is no commandline option, then
"default_vmode == VMODE_NVRAM")
Reviewing the 2.2.20 kernel shows that the NVRAM "if" checks in
"init_control" need "else" statements.
["else vmode=default_vmode;"]
The same applies to "default_cmode".
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Keith Velleux
P.S.  It is 4:00 AM, and I can no longer think.
