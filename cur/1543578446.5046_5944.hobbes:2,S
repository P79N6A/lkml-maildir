No. You'd explicitly only use the static registration when object X doesn't 
_need_ initialisation, which is the case for my code.
As it is, I've had to add completely now init routines for 
modules which didn't have them before, and all those init routines do is 
inter_module_register() and pray that they're called in time.

I have decided when I'm ready to provide the service. At compile time. 
Ensuring that the code is initialised in the correct order is not a fact of 
life. It's an artifact of the limited functionality of the new setup.

For cases where the code really does need initialisation, that is true. It 
should be done properly rather than just implicitly ordered by the 
Makefile. But in this case, the command set drivers don't need 
initialisation. They just provide a function for use by the generic CFI 
init code. They don't _need_ to initialise themselves beforehand.
The dynamic registration has introduced this ordering dependency when 
previously there was none.

Then he either hasn't considered this particular case, or he's wrong. It 
happens. I'm not suggesting that we change it drastically, only that we add 
the option of static (compile-time) registration for those entries which 
require it. 
Actually, I'd rather do this with weak symbols. Something along the lines 
of...
 extern cfi_cmdset_fn_t cfi_cmdset_0001 __attribute__((weak));
 extern cfi_cmdset_fn_t cfi_cmdset_0002 __attribute__((weak));
 ...
 if (cfi_cmdset_0001 && chip_is_type_1())
	return cfi_cmdset_0001(args...);
 if (cfi_cmdset_0002 && chip_is_type_2())
	return cfi_cmdset_0002(args...);
 return cfi_cmdset_load_module(args...)
Unfortunately, I couldn't get it to work reliably on anything but x86.
