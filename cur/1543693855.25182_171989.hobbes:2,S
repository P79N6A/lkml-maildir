OK.. now for the terminally dense readers of the list like myself, could
you repeat that in terms that people who have more experience in
slinging C code than buzzwords will understand and rally behind?
Most of the time when I hear "component", somebody's trying to invent
yet another message-passing paradigm.  And although there's certainly
a place where things like CORBA and the dbus stuff solve problems,
you have to remember that this is a Linux kernel, not Mach....
Alternatively, explain to me what this component model will do for us
that updating the docs on the kernel API won't?
