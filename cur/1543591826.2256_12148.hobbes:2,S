and it is the double of the iommu space that I am going to reserve for
pci dynamic mappings on the tsunami (right now it is 128Mbyte... and I'll
change to 512mbyte) also bttv is not doing that a large dma and by
default it only uses 2 buffers in the ring. bttv is not a good example
of what can really overflow the pci virtual address space in real life
(when I mentioned it it was only to point out it still uses
virt_to_bus), filling a pci bus with bttv cards sounds quite silly
anyways ;)
