I was lagging cvs; v0003 merges to today's tree, including the new
CPU_SPEED code. posted at the url above.

agree. here's a separate patch for x86+ia64. with it, there's one
extra argument to op_do_profile, and oprofile.c no longer uses op_arch.h
the architecture code directly passes eip and irq_enabled. tested on
i686 2.4.20 and ppc 2.4.20-benh.

ppc v0003 depends on this change.

I'll let you handle this one.
BTW how do you feel about reworking add_sysctl and remove_sysctl to move
shared code inside oprofile.c? Right now the duplication is causing
inconsistency e.g ia64/op_pmu.c "next->mode = 0700;" vs x86/op_nmi.c
"next->mode = 0755;"
