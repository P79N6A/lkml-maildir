Yes, I've read that, and as you say:

While this problem will be fixed in Linux 2.6.x kernel series, the 2.4.x 
users are frustrated. Daniele Peri, Rob Miller and Paul Hampson mananged

I've a 2.6.7-rc3 kernel, this bug report is mostly a feedback message.
The Toshiba 1800-100 is not listed in the table written by Thomas Pinz.
I have written here with the hope that the data present in the mail may 
help the authors finding what's wrong in the init code for the driver or 
in the finding some working parameters.
