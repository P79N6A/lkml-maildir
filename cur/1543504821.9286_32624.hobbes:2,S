Greetings,
I hope this isn't the wrong list, I've been digging through so many of   them recently, it's hard to decide. I don't know if it's a NFS problem, a   kernel (knfsd) problem, a file system problem or a network problem. I   just need some help.
How the heck, explicitly, do I export the CDROM so other machines can   mount and read the darn thing?! I've exported and can read the root level   and /raid from all Unix boxes on our network, but I can't read a thing   out of /mnt/cdrom from ANY of the same Unix boxes. What the heck   happened?
I have searched HI and LOW and cannot find a definitive answer to this   question. Please forgive me if I've searched in the wrong places, but all   I can find is that the 'knfsd changed' and recommendations to 'put it in   the /etc/exports file' and then try 'exportfs -avr and see if there are   any errors'. I've tried and I'm stupid and I'm failing miserably.
I had been running Redhat 5.2 and was loving that I could cd from any   Unix box in our network to /net/linuxbox/mnt/cdrom and have it work. If I   recall correctly, any volume under the exported root volume was   automatically accessible to any of the remote clients (within security   limitations).
I'm running Redhat 6 now and this is certainly not the case any longer. I   AM DYING HERE!!! Take a nice feature and then fix it, man. Excuse my   obvious frustration, but I've spent the last 6 freaking hours reading,   searching, trying, yada, yada, yada and have gotten NOWHERE. God, am I a   MORON or what?! Can it really be this freaking difficult?
Please help. Please respond directly to:
