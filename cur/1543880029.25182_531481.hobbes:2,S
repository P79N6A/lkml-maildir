the v1 patch is still downloadable so you can do a delta by first 
applying the v1 patch to a quilt queue, doing a 'quilt snapshot', then 
'quilt pop', add the v2 patch to the series file, do a 'quilt push', 
then doing a "quilt diff --snapshot". (I just posted the delta patch in 
this thread so you can pick it from there too.)
