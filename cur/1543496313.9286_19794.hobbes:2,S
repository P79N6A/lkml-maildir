  Once upon a time, just before Plan9 was released to Universities, I went
to a USENIX microkernel conference up in Seattle where Plan9 was being
compared against Mach, NT (!) and a few other popular kernels of the time.
  The first half-day was factual, with various people giving factual stats
about their kernels, overhead, footprint, etc.  Then the microsoft
droid came on and gave us a sales pitch!  Marketing slides, the whole
nine yards -- totally non-technical, total drivel.  Compared to all the
previous presentations, it was totally off-topic.
  At that point, the people from AT&T had already proven that they
were going to be lively and interesting from their introductory talks,
and I didn't want to ditch because you could see that the AT&T guys were
up to something -- they were whispering to themselves and running around
drawing on slides.
  When it came time for AT&T to talk about Plan9, they had added a whole
new microsoft-slamming forward.  One of them had hand-drawn a sales
chart (fat line down the `0' axis since they were giving it away),
expected growth (moderate), revenue (0), etc.  He finished the intro by
welcoming microsoft into the 60's as I recall, and then got on with his
prepared presentation.  (:
