Yeah, for suspend-to-ram+resume and for snapshot+restore you probably  
want userspace to support some kind of initscript-like mechanism  
which is triggered by the lid-switch or something before calling into  
the kernel.  That way it can close network connections mostly-nicely  
and down network interfaces before suspending, then re-run DHCP/ 
802.11/whatever configuration after resume/restore.  That might not  
be a bad place to handle NFS mounts and such too.
