Subject: [PATCH] acct: real_parent ppid
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/7/322

The ac_ppid field reported in process accounting records
should match what getppid() would have returned to that
process, regardless of whether a debugger is attached.
