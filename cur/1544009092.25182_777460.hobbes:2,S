Could you ack the patch?  Stephen explicitly doesn't want patches
in linux-next which haven't been acked, and security-next feeds
into linux-next, so I don't want to ask James to take the patch
without an ack :)

Agreed.  Now the thing is I don't think we need full userns
support to get there.  We just need the targeted capabilities
and the basic dummy fs support - that is, init_user_ns owns
all vfsmounts, and anyone not in init_user_ns only gets
user other access to files under those mounts.
Of course complete support for targeted caps will in itself
be a huge effort :)
So my roadmap is: next address the per-user keyring, then
the targeted caps.
