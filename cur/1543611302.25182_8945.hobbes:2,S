It's a long shot, but you might try upgrading to
the latest release of apmd, 3.0.2.  You might also
try killing  apmd altogether before suspending;
see what happens.
Does it make any difference if X is not running
when you try to suspend?
Is your BIOS up to date?
Is the only problem the fact that you sometimes have
to press Fn+D to get the suspend to complete?  If so,
that doesn't seem like too big a deal (even if it would
be nice if it were fixed).  Or is the problem more
serious than that?
