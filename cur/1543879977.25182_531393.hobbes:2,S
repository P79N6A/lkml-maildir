Yup, we have the same problem with other devices.  See the long list
of PNP IDs in 8250_pnp.c :-)

Yes, I see that it's attractive to use a single w83627ehf.c driver.
For an ACPI driver, we'd have to build a list of PNP IDs, and possibly
information about which methods read which information.  That's
certainly more work.
On the other hand, the ACPI driver would avoid the synchronization
issues that started this whole thread.  That's a pretty compelling
advantage.

Maybe Asus didn't hook up those readings on the board.  I would
guess that PC Probe doesn't expose the VSB or battery voltage either.
I'm sure you've seen these:

Looks like nobody took up the challenge, though :-)  It looks fun
to play with, if only I had the time and hardware.
