You can still use the 2.0.x PCI functions on 2.4.x.  They are slower
than the 'struct pci_dev' versions of the functions, because each
pcibios_xxx call incurs a call to pci_find_slot().

That depends on both the changes and your driver...  Every driver is
different, so nothing is really canonical WRT driver API changes.  If
your driver is similar to a sound card, then look at drivers/sound/*.c
