Yes.

You can hide all of those problems in libpci.a or whatever.
You page align the offset, but pass back to the user a pointer
with his sub-page offset applied to it.
The kernel wants pages, so just give it pages :-)

Yeah, that one is all about enabling VGA forwarding in the bridges.
Taking out all of the resource garbage in the X server, and replacing
it with properly synchronized calls in the kernel for mapping ROMs
and changing the current VGA forwarding seems to be the way to go.

Some scsi controllers have prefetchable set in their normal
register BARs.  The sym53c8xx does if I remember correctly.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that blinding turning prefetchable
BAR into "don't set side effect bit in PTE" might not be so wise.
I really think it's a userlevel decision.  That's where all the ioctl()
garbage came from for the /proc/bus/pci mmap() stuff.  It was for chossing
IO vs MEM space, and also for setting these kinds of mapping attributes.
