If you have permanently high load average - sure, you need to bump
the limits. Always had been that way, nothing to do with the kernel.
OTOH, I really don't see WTF are FTP clients giving that kind of LA -
unless you've got really thick pipe on a box, that is. If it's a server -
WTF are they doing there at all? And if it isn't... Nice connectivity
you have there.
