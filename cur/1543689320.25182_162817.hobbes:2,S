  Also try "hdparm  -a 2048 <some device>" before running hdparm.  Also 
the ide section of dmesg woul dbe handy in addition to the above.
[root@goblin e2fsprogs-1.26]# hdparm  -t /dev/hdg
/dev/hdg:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   70 MB in  3.04 seconds =  23.03 MB/sec
[root@goblin e2fsprogs-1.26]# hdparm  -a 2048 /dev/hdg
/dev/hdg:
 setting fs readahead to 2048
 readahead    = 2048 (on)
[root@goblin e2fsprogs-1.26]# hdparm  -t /dev/hdg
/dev/hdg:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  122 MB in  3.01 seconds =  40.47 MB/sec
