I can't immediately think of anything smarter.
One could of course implement a 64-bit percpu counter by simply
concatenating two 32-bit counters.  That would be a little less efficient,
but would introduce less source code and would mean that we don't need to
keep two different implemetations in sync.  But one would need to do a bit
of implementation, see how bad it looks.
