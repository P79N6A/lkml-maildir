I initially missed that part of your patch, and that is incorrect - Only
part of ACPI (CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP) should depend on CONFIG_PM.

I can buy that. There are actually three levels of power management that 
we handle:
- System Power Management (swsusp, CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP)
- Device Power Management (kernel/pm.c, future driver model support)
- CPU Power Management (cpufreq)
SPM implies that DPM will be enabled, but both DPM and CPM can exist 
without SPM, and independently of each other. All of them would 
essentially fall under CONFIG_PM.. 
Would you willing to whip up a patch for the Kconfig entries?
