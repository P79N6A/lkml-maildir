If you're going to go ahead with this, shouldn't the message say that
the module will not be loadable into *kernels released* after January 1,
2008?  I bet a lot of people would read the above to say that their
system will just drop dead of a New Year's hangover, and they'll freak.
I wouldn't want to be the one getting all the email at that point...
