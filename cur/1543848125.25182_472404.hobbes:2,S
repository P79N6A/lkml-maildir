Oh, well, that does make a difference! :) I misread your email: I thought you 
were suggesting 1024 fdarray entries, not 1024 bytes. I'd agree with you 
completely then.

Good point. Code can then simply become:
nr /= (1024 / sizeof(struct file *));
nr = roundup_pow_of_two(nr + 1);
nr *= (1024 / sizeof(struct file *));

Your feedback is very much appreciated, believe me! :) Both you (for the 
ideas) and akpm (for his assistance and seemingly-infinite patience, even 
when I accidentally broke his tree (I owe him a few beers/other-goodies for 
that)) have helped out tremendously with this.
So far, I have two comments from you that I need to take care of:
1) allocate at least L1_CACHE_BYTES for fdsets
2) change PAGE_SIZE/4 to 1024
Both are performance tweaks, not crash fixes, and are easy to do. Could you 
please look through the rest of the code in fs/file.c and point out any other 
issues or code tweaks you can see? My plan is to prepare patches for these 
things and buffer them up, and when we're done tweaking, I'll forward the 
whole batch on to akpm.
Then, once everything has settled down for a long while, I'll send out the 
final fs/file.c cleanups patch -- mostly it introduces extensive comments 
into that file about why the code does what it does.
