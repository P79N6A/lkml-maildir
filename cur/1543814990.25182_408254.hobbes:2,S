I dont want to remap myself after execve() because considering the
potential problem of ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), since
the segments may contain sections merged into it especially the
segments with permissions 'rw-p' has .dynamic, .got sections merged
into it so if I do that after execve the .dynamic and .got are put
back with the old contents which crashes.
So I want to write the all the virtual adress mappings as PT_LOAD
segments and leave the mapping job to the elf loader itself.
Thank you,
