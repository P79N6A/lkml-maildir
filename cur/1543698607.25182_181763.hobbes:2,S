Hello,
Along with the lockups already described here, I've noticed an
unidentified source of interrupts on IRQ7. Several people posted their
/proc/interrupts but it only shows interrupts a driver registered and is
using. I noticed a non-constant stream of interrupts on IRQ7 using sar
and I am also able to see it under /proc/interrupts when loading
parport_pc with options to get the driver using the interrupt. However
it is not related to the parallel port because putting it on IRQ5 or
disabling it in the BIOS does not affect the stream of interrupts on
IRQ7. I wonder if people experiencing lockup problems also have these
noise interrupts, and I don't know if this has something to do with the
lockups or if it is an independant problem.
Of course, booting with noapic nolapic, the system is rock-solid, and
the interrupt counter on IRQ7 stays solidly at 1 (should it be 0 ?),
until I use something on the parallel port of course.
