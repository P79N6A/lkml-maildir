How about a flag in the power struct, which would place the device on a 
completely separate list from the beginning. The drivers should know 
whether a device needs special handling a priori, so we don't even need to 
touch it during the first iteration of the lists.
This would eliminate the need to check in the drivers, have no impact on 
the majority of drivers, and allow us to easily determine whether or not 
the device supports runtime power management.
