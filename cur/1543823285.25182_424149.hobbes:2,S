2.6.17-rc4-git2 doesn't contain the changes.  You're still using old EH. 
  To test the updates, pull #upstream from libata-dev git tree which can 
be found on 
http://kernel.org/git.
  Otherwise, you can try 
libata-tj-stable patch over 2.6.16.16 located at
http://home-tj.org/wiki/index.php/Libata-tj-stable.
