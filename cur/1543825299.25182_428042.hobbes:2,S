 Okay.

 Oh, that's right. I didn't see the return statement.

 Ok.

| We first used 2.6.15. We got different types of error : a panic in
| ipaq_read_bulk_callback(), the bug I mentionned in
| 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0605.2/1770.html
 and the
| current problem. We first tried upgrading to 2.6.16, which did not help.
| 
| The panic was caused by the read urb being submitten in ipaq_open,
| regardless of success, and never killed in case of failure. What my
| patch basically does is to submit the urb only after succesfully sending
| the control message, and adding a sleep between tries. As long as this
| patch is not applied, we hardly get any other error because the kernel
| panics as soon as an ipaq reboots.
 I see.
 Did you try to just kill the read urb in the ipaq_open's error path?
