   Sometimes it almost works. I sent test10-pre6 to another
   local machine (stock rh6.2). The problem box was running
   vanilla test10-pre5, i486, gcc-2.95.2.

I am puzzled as well.  Firstly, any change to try compiling the test10
kernels with egcs-1.1.x and see if that makes a difference (you have a
stock rh6.2 machine so doing this should not be very difficult :-)
