It's an ALSA FAQ - you must load the snd-pcm1-oss / snd-ossseq modules
to use the OSS compatible devices. See the FAQ in the alsa-driver
directory:
Q: Driver is working (mixer at least), but OSS programs says: Can't open
   /dev/dsp. What's wrong?
A: OSS compatible PCM (digital audio) emulation comes as add-on module which
   isn't loaded by default. If you have modified /etc/conf.module as suggested
   in INSTALL, it should be loaded with kerneld or kmod. Check it - if this
   method for some reason doesn't work - you need insert 'snd-pcm1-oss' module
   manualy.
