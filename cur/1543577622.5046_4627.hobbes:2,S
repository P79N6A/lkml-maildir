I'm also seeing this on 2.4.0 proper with almost the same hardware:
 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7881U (rev 01) (aic71xxxx driver)
VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA 1064SG [Mystique]
(rev 03)
SB Vibra16X sound card.
I swap to scsi as the ide performance on this board just blows, I get into
a heavy swap situation and *boom* deadlocked.
