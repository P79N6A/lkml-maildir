It is none of the driver's business to worry about disk geometry.
The driver does not need it itself, but only thinks that fdisk
and/or LILO might want to know. But fdisk and LILO do a much better
job - they examine the partition table much more carefully than
some SCSI drivers do.
No, code like that in scsicam_bios_param() is entirely ridiculous,
and only does harm.
[On the other hand, there is no hurry in changing either.
Every change will cause problems for a few people,
so even though it is entirely wrong I left it for the time being.]
