Do you see "can't fill rx buffer" messages?
If so, then your load is too big, and memory management is incapable of
freeing memory in time.
Right now the kernel doesn't allow to increase atomic allocation
reservation (which is a serious misfeature), so you need to hack and
change the reservation in the kernel.
If the network doesn't come alive when you remove the load, it's a second
problem, a bug in the driver.  I've seen such reports, but they aren't
frequent.  On my computer, the driver resumes operations well.
Why the driver can't do it for some people needs deep investigations.

tcpdumps won't help.
