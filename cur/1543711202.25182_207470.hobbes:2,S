Not necessarily. It might just fail to meet the timing specification the 
controller is demanding.
A similar effect occured with my scanner attached to a adaptec 
controller. BTW, which brand is your controller?

You might want to try whether the following is working - within the 
computers BIOS setup disable both external and internal caching 
temporarily. This makes the system extremely sloooooooooooow - but it 
made my scanner working. (That's no solution, of course!  --  Just a 
way to trace the problem.)
