The problem is that in Unix the fundamental identity of a file is
the tuple (blkdev, inum); names are merely indices (links) that resolve to
that tuple.   Personally, I'd swap to a pair of system calls to map
name to (blkdev, inum), and open(blkdev, inum).  Think of the inode
number as a unique within-filesystem index.
