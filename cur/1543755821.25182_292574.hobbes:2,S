It would be nice if this stuff was CC'd to the network, and network 
driver maintainers.
Two immediate concerns I have are,
* saving and restoring dev->hard_header is more than a little bit of a hack
* overall, I'm not so sure IPv6 support should be conditionalized on 
anything but CONFIG_IPV6.  Though S/390 and qeth are certainly unusual 
cases, none of the other net drivers in the kernel require a special 
config option to enable IPv6 support.
