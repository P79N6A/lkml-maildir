 AFAIK, PCI isn't compiled as modules and USB has ohci/uhci/ehci stuff
and serio has ports stuff.  But still, I cannot agree with you.
 1. It's too twisted.
	a. to prevent premature unload, we depend on
	   - attr -> kobj -> module_ref to bus core module.  By doing
	   this, we're making a chain of two different types of
	   reference counts.  IMHO, it's just a bit too subtle.
	b. to enable bus module unload, we depend on
	   - device creation/detach operations are done in a separate
	     module than device release.
 2. too restrictive.
	a. any bus implementation must be implemented as two separate
	   modules just to enable peaceful module unloading
	b. all other places which make use of kobject and any type of
	   generic attr must use only the release routine proper to
	   the core module.  No callbacks, no data dereferences....
	   (for example, scsi_host class uses scsi_host_template
	    structure which contain class device specific callbacks
	    when releaseing scsi_host class device.  This is
	    currently broken and won't be fixed by your method.)
 3. not intutive.  Maybe this is the most important.
	a. it's natural to expect the release code has access to
	   codes & data of whatever it's releasing.
	b. children bypassing dependency hierarchy and depending
	   directly on indirect ancestor is just difficult to
           track, memorize and do correctly.
    IMO, above a and b are the primary reasons for why kobject/attr
    refcountings are currently done incorrectly in many places.

 Yes, there are.  But many objects which contain kobjs keep separate
owner field anyway, which can be removed after kobj can handle module
refcounting, and even without that, I think 4 or 8 bytes addition to
struct kobject is worth it if we can get the refcounting straight.
 Thanks.
