I've run into non-monotonic gettimeofday() on a PPC system with 2.2.17, but it
always seemed to be almost exactly a jiffy out, as though it was getting
hundredths of a second from the old tick, and microseconds from the new tick. 
Your leap seems to be more unusual, and the first one I've seen on an x86 box.
Have you considered storing the results to see what happens on the next call? 
Does it make up the difference, or do you just lose that time?
Chris
