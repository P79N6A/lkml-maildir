Thanks -- unfortunately I only have one switch module :(
With the 3.9 tg3 driver, neither SoL nor the real network seems to
ever come back.  As far as I can tell, the network is dead (and
without SoL there's no way for me to see what happens to the kernel).
Have you had success with the latest tg3 on JS20?
