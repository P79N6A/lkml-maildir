Hi Ben - Right, sorry, I mean to apply "accelerated" to the 3D effects; 
the private ATI driver is much faster on glxgears than the version that 
bundles with XFree.

I'm having two, actually.  The first is that YPAN is getting quite 
confused.  If I switch VCs, then switch back, the text has been 
re-arranged, the cursor is often invisible, and sometimes a page or two 
of new text must be written before anything starts to show up on the 
screen again.  Experimenting shows that setting VYRES = YRES works 
around this problem.
The second problem is of course the register contents issue when 
returning from certain graphics programs (e.g. X+fglr) to text mode..  I 
rather like your idea of doing a re-init when switching from KD_GRAPHICS 
to KD_TEXT, as the monitor blank during resolution switch will likely 
overshadow the re-init process.

At work now, will try when I return home later...
