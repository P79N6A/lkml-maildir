For the last several weeks I have been problems doing backups to my
ATAPI tape drive.  I'v been seeing two different problems based on
how I do the backups.
If I use the following:
	find . -print | cpio -ocvB > /dev/ht0
The backup will run for a few minutes and then stops, the cpio process
cannot be killed attempting to trace the cpio process will sometimes
cause strace to hang.  A ps listing shows cpio in the down_failed
routine.
If I use the following:
	tar cvf /dev/ht0 .
The backup runs for a long time, I don't know how long because I ran
it over night, but when I go to see if it completed the system is
dead.  No keyboard no mouse no network it is dead.  This has occured
on at least 3 occasions.  None of the logs show anything.
Yesterday I upgraded to RH6.0 and re-ran the tar command above.
This time the system was still alive this morning, and here's what
the ps listing shows:
100     0 14373   566   0   0   1260   596 down_failed D    1  0:16 tar cvf /dev/ht0 .
I am running the 2.2.7 kernel with Alan's ac1 patch.  My system is a
dual Pentium 350Mhz, the file system I'm backing up is an ext2 FS on
a SCSI disk.  The SCSI controller is onboard the ASUS motherboard and
is an AIC7890.  The FS contains about 33000 files and about 1GB worth
of data (mostly source files).
I have been able to backup smaller amounts of data.
Unfortunately I don't have the .config file, since I'm sending this
from work and the system having the problem is at home.
I am currently running the tape driver as a module, but the problem
occurs either way.
Any help in trying to resolve this problem would be appreciated.
Thanks
Paolo
