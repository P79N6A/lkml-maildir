It's been on the todo list for a long while... there's been talks at
different events about it, there'll be a talk at LCA from me again
about it and what has happened since KS (not a huge amount)....
We've nearly all agreed on a direction, we haven't found anyone with
the bandwidth to actually move things in that direction... (or at
least no-one has said to me heres some money  go do this thing... :-)
