There is more to it than that:
What if you for some reason try to set the priority of a low level task 
from a high priority one? It could be that your application have some kind 
of watchdog or manager process dynamically adjusting the priorities of the 
other tasks. You simply don't want to be concerned about those tasks being 
blocked in some strange (maybe even buggy) logging structure. You want to 
do it O(1) and then let those tasks handle it.

I know you hate to let the scheduler do the work for you, but I find it 
very elegant and easy once in a while :-)
