I think if it were clear, there would not be so much argument about
it.  It won't take you long to find many names with slashes being used
to intimately tie companies and products, rather than make clear the
separation as you suggest.
I submit: FSF/GNU.  I can create that as easily as Stallman created
GNU/Linux (the name I mean).  It's meaning could be argued endlessly
just too.  I guess that means both have a lot in common... :)
