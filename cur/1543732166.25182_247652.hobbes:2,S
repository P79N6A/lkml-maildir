Yep unfortunately we end up with ticks in the out of line spinlock
functions. We could recognise this in the profile code and walk up the
stack, I think sparc64 has been doing that.
I have a similar problem with hardware performance counters but its much
more difficult there. Since we dont have an NMI you get the profile tick
when interrupts are reenabled. At that point we may be out of the spin
lock so backtracing is impossible.
