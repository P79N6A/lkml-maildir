Well, I think there should be a window between ->suspend_begin()
and ->suspend() allowing the core to cancel the suspending of given
device and to select another one.  For example, if there's a child
registration concurrent wrt ->suspend_begin() which completes after
->suspend_begin() has been called, but before ->suspend_begin() has a chance
to block it, the core should not call ->suspend() for the device, but select
another one (the child).
Of course, it won't be necessary if the ->suspend_begin() methods are called
in an initial forward pass through dpm_active.

Well, I think the possibility to freeze kernel threads on demand may be
considered as one of suspend synchronization mechanisms available to drivers.

Yes, that should work.  I'll rework the patch along these lines (it starts to
look really simple now :-); I'll post the new version in a separate thread).

Yes, it is.

That's correct.  Perhaps we should change device_add().

I meant ->hibernate_begin() as ->freeze_begin() and I don't see any reason why
->prethaw_begin() would be different from it (the difference between ->freeze()
and ->prethaw() -- now called ->quiesce(), btw -- is that the former saves
device settings and the latter doesn't).

I thought ->suspend() would be mandatory, even if it's to be empty.

If such devices serve as logical parents of some "real" ones, we should
at least mark them as "sleeping" during suspend to protect the dpm_active
ordering.
