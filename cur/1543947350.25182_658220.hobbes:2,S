Subject: [PATCH] [BUILD_FAILURE] 2.6.25-rc2-mm1 - Build Failure at acpi_os
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/22/336

Let's see what the ACPI people think about this change.
Thanks, Sam.

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Make ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT boolean config symbol a hidden and derived
value, based on the value of ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE (string).
Only the latter is presented to the user as a config option.
This fixes problems with "make randconfig" setting ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT
but leaving ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE empty/blank.
