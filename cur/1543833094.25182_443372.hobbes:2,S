I had noticed that code looked new and quite clean, I have not seen
any problems with it.

My original goal was to do some work on the VT layer but I got sucked
into the TTY code because of VT/TTY interactions. I think I understand
enough now that I can make changes in the VT code without breaking
everything. I also see now that the VT code wasn't as closely
intertwined into the TTY code as much as I initially thought it was.
So getting back to my VT problem, I want to fully decouple the VT code
from the TTY code. By decoupling I mean make the VT code use APIs and
not have #ifdef CONFIG_VT sprinkled all over the place. There are
fifteen #ifdef CONFIG_VT's is general kernel code and about twenty
more in arch specific code.
One #ifdef CONFIG_VT is in tty_init().  The tty layer is being
initialized via module_init(tty_init) which is the same as
device_initcall(fn).  Link order is pci, video, acpi, char, serial,
base. This doesn't look right to me since the video console drivers
need the tty code to function.
This may also explain why the init functions are all chained together.
tty_init() -> vty_init() -> vcs_init(), kbd_init(), prom_con_init(),
etc... Since the link order is wrong the chained init functions are
compensating.
The fix for this is to get things linking in the right order, add
module_init() where needed then all of the chained init()'s can be
removed.
