Alan, if the scenario was like you described at the beginning, there was
no deadlock possible, unless some errors in the notifier. These #1-#3
threads were only helpful to guess what lockdep could 'think', but I
guess notifier doesn't use 2 rivaling threads for a wake, so, lockdep
probably needed additional information. And you really can't consider
any hypothetical kernel bugs here because then each lock is vulnerable.
