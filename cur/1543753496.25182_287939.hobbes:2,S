I'm having trouble seeing what's in -bk.  I have a clone of
bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5, but when I "bk pull" there it says
"Nothing to pull."  And my clone doesn't have all the aoe patches I've
seen get pushed to -bk.

The unregister_blkdev should already be in aoemain.c:aoe_exit.
static void
aoe_exit(void)
{
	discover_timer(TKILL);
	aoenet_exit();
	unregister_blkdev(AOE_MAJOR, DEVICE_NAME);
	aoechr_exit();
	aoedev_exit();
	aoeblk_exit();		/* free cache after de-allocating bufs */

Hmm.  I'll try to send a patch against usb, since I can pull from
there.
