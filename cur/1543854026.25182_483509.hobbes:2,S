How come nobody noticed?  Maybe it improved things ;)
I spose it's 2.6.19 material, although it's a bit of a leap into the
unknown.
How many systems will this affect?

It seems strange that the kernel is calling acpi_processor_power_exit() at
this stage.  It'll have happened because acpi_start_single_object()'s call
to acpi_processor_start() returned non-zero.  Why did that happen?

Surely that should be either AE_OK (but why?) or -ESOMETHING.

Andreas wasn't seeing that, right?

I'd assume that this is failing.  I wonder why?

whoops, this return value gets lost.
