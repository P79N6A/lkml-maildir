Colin,
thanks for ACKing the feedback.
I think there is still some confusion...

Correct. The patch ignores/overides pci_root_ops with sn_pci_root_ops
(which is what I originally suggested).
Mathew's point was only raw_pci_ops needs to point at a different
set of struct pci_raw_ops (see include/linux/pci.h).

If it can be avoided, preferably not. But that's up to Jesse/Tony I think.

Can you quote the bit of the patch which implements "if the bus does not
exist" check?
I can't find it.

I think that's up to Jesse/Tony.
I don't "own" any of the code in question.
Just trying to undo the confusion I caused.
