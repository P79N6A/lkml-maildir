We've got what looks like a bug in the tulip driver (or maybe buggy hardware)
that under certain circumstances can block with what looks like a problem in the
ring buffer.  Someone is looking at the driver, but in the meantime the only way
to fix it is to do "ip link set dev ethX down" followed by "ip link set dev ethX
up".  Whatever code path this causes in the driver is enough to fix the issue. 
I assume its due to the re-initialization of the buffer descriptors.
On some consideration, maybe it would make more sense in this case to add
something to the driver itself to re-initialize itself rather than involving the
rest of the kernel.  However, I do think that taking down a link and bringing it
back up should be inverse procedures.  If there were routes associated with a
link before taking it down, then they should be associated with it after
bringing it back up, whether or not they stick around when the link is actually
down.  This is how addresses behave, so I think routes should be similar.
