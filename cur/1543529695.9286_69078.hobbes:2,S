Hello !
I could not find new bugs.
I did :
1. stress.sh 50 with big source tree (~750 MB)
2. postmark 50000 files, 50000 transactions
3. creating 1 million of small files
4. tar / untar kernel source tree
5. compile 2.3.51 kernel on reiserfs partition
6. bonnie++ with default parameters.
7. mongo.sh with default params and with 56000 files in 1 dir.
Reiserfs-3-6-1 for linux-2.3.51 are stable. At least I have not found
bugs yet. 
I think we are ready to do the patch.
Best,
Yura.
