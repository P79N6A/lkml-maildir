Well, I look at the MTD code a lot... That's why I used it (i.e. that was the
existence proof I found that it's fine ;-)
>I don't know whether MIT is GPL-compatible-for-kernel-purposes or not.  Help.
Nothing it that license precludes the code being redistributed under the
GPL.  (It is a verbatim copy of
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
).
>MODULE_LICENSE("Dual MIT/GPL");
Is fine with me, indeed, given the license text, I don't believe I retain
any rights to *prevent* such a change (and it was certainly not my intent
to prevent redistribution under a more restrictive license).  Using 'MIT'
or substituting some more specific tag must be fine for the same reason
(it's a name of a license, not a license itself).
