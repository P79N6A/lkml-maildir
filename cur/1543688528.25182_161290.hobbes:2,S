I was testing this with only a single partition mounted with extents 
enabled when benchmarking.  Ext3 gave no messages of being mounted 
afterbootup with or without extents so to make sure i had extents 
enabled i booted with all my partitions with the extents option.  I 
suspect then my problems began.  I'm completely unaware of the extent of 
the damage enabling extents has done since most of the important things 
were opened, not created during my extents use.  In any case it may be 
that the reason why init is not able to be found is because i used apt 
and upgraded my system ...and I dont remember if i had extents enabled 
at the time or not.  If my init is in extents format though, then why is 
a patched kernel able to read it with extents not being enabled via the 
omunt option where as kernels without the patch cannot.  Is extents able 
to be read from a fs even when it's not mounted with the option but not 
written?   I'm kinda confused, this aspect of extents wasn't in the 
original email.

i'm going to try and boot a kernel without the extents patch (so far 
hasn't been possible) and run dbench again and see if i get different 
numbers.  I'm almost suspecting extents being enabled no matter what i 
mount the fs's as.
