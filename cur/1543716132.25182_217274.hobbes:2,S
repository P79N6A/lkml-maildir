The IFkit ( both 8/8/8 and 0/8/8) and the TextLCD will work nearly the 
same as Sean's servo control. They will use sysfs also. They will be 
blacklisted from HID. Sean, what phidget did you want to work on next. 
I just wanted to make sure, I was not stepping on others toes by 
jumping on the ones I picked. If you want Chester can just make us a 
big ol punchlist and we can just start knocking them out. I have most 
of the phidgets except the stepper controller, power bar, dc 
controller, and the new 0/16/16. I think thats correct, right 
Chester..?
And yay I finally got my linux dev. box back from dead. I was beginning 
to worry, I was not going to be able to do anything, and Sean would 
have finished it all. :-) But hopefully by tonight I will have 
everything ready to go.
