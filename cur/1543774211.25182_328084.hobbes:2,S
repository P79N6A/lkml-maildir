Do a google on '/dev2/root2' and you will see that /proc/mounts on Debian reports false information for the root filesystem device, and this is a longstanding problem. The result is that on systems with this problem /etc/mtab is correct but /proc/mounts is not.
This appears to be more a kernel problem than a distribution problem - how is it even _possible_ for some userspace process to get /proc/mounts to publish erroneous information?  Why are there no consistency checks in /proc/mounts?
$ cat /proc/mounts

$ ls -l /dev2 /dev2/root2
ls: /dev2: No such file or directory
