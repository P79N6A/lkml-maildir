Subject: weird messages on boot

I got another strange problem on my system that cropped up this
weekend and I can't think of anything I did to cause this.  The
problem is this, when I boot my system I get the following message:
	neighbour table overflow
This repeats every few seconds.  A netstat -i shows that the loopback
interface is not up, it only shows the eth0 interface.  If I shutdown
networking by running /etc/rc.d/init.d/network stop and then start
the messages no longer appear.  The message comes from net/ipv4/route.c,
so I assume it has to do with setting up routing.  Below is my config.
Any help would be appreciated.  I'm running 2.2.7+ac1 along with RH6.0,
however, I upgraded to 6.0 over a week ago, and only this weekend have
I started seeing this.
