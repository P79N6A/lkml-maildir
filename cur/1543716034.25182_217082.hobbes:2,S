Why cannot the binary module suppliers tell their customers why this 'tainted' 
message is appearing in their kernel log?
You know they are human, and have a mind of their own, they would probably 
have understood the fact that the company is providing it's own set of 
drivers that might not be tested fully on every kernel release. And so their 
customers (like what nVidias and others companies customers have done in the 
past) would turn to this company for support instead of the lkml.
