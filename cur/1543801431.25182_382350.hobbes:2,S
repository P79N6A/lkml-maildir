the asm/spinlock.h ops are only built on SMP kernels. mutex.h is for 
both UP and SMP. On UP you should need no synchronization, because the 
only way another context could interfere with your critical section is 
by getting interrupted, and interrupts are fully synchronizing, right?  
On UP the only synchronization needed is when a device reads/writes 
memory in parallel to the CPU.
