Won't work with separate source and object trees in kbuild 2.5.
  export KBUILD_SRCTREE_000=/build/kaos/2.4.13-kbuild-2.5
  export KBUILD_OBJTREE=/build/kaos/object-2.4.13
  cd /anywhere/you/like
  make -f $KBUILD_SRCTREE_000/Makefile-2.5
If you define the kbuild tree variables then you can be in any
directory when you issue the make command.  If you are using shadow
trees then you can be in a sparse source tree which only contains of
the files.

grep CONFIG_KBUILD_2_5 .config is better, you can still build using
kbuild 2.4 even after applying the 2.5 patch.  The presence of a kbuild
2.5 file is not definitive.  Of course the .config is in $KBUILD_OBJTREE
which might not be the current directory.
