This is a misunderstanding.  When I said "running", I meant running as
opposed to sleeping.  The dozens of sleeping processes everyone has on
their machine won't affect scheduling at all.

Xosview runs with regularity and therefore makes X run with regularity. 
There you are.  Try changing the refresh rate of xosview and see what
happens.  Try not to use X (eliminates one running task).
