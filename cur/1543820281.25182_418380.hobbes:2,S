if the issue is bus vs network bitrates would offloading really buy that 
much?  i suppose that for minimum sized packets not DMA'ing the headers 
across the bus would be a decent win, but down at small packet sizes 
where headers would be 1/3 to 1/2 the stuff DMA'd around, I would think 
one is talking more about CPU path lengths than bus bitrates.
and up and "full size" segments, since everyone is so fond of bulk 
transfer tests, the transfer saved by not shovig headers across the bus 
is what 54/1448 or ~3.75%
spreading interrupts via MSI-X seems nice and all, but i keep wondering 
if the header field-based distribution that is (will be) done by the 
NICs is putting the cart before the horse - should the NIC essentially 
be telling the system the CPU on which to run the application, or should 
the CPU on which the application runs be telling "networking" where it 
should be happening?
