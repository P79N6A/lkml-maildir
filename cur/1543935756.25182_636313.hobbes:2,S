Some of the stacktrace of the OP looks like the ones I posted.
The timeframe also matches since I noticed the first problems in 2.6.19
like the OP.
I remounted the fs without noatime and we'll see if it still freezes
next week.
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any bug fix for this problem yet
(except the upcoming per device write throttling patch).
Thanks for pointing me in this direction,
