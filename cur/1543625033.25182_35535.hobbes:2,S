Then you get to save them as diffs, unedit the files, and put them back 
after the merge.

citool is a tcl program, how about you hack it in?  Look for $diffsOpts,
that's what you'll need to modify.  You need to get the diffs parsing 
code to do the right thing with -up style diffs though.

Get bk-2.1.5.  We added multiple options to the edit button, try the fmtool
option and learn how to use it.  You can trivially walk the code and pick
and choose which diffs you want.

We don't have this feature.  We've talked about it, but that's all we've
done.
