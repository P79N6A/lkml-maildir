well, ->wait_runtime is in real time units. If a task executes 
delta_exec time on the CPU, we deduct "-delta_exec" 1:1. But during that 
time the task also got entitled to a bit more CPU time, that is 
+delta_mine. The calculation above expresses this. I'm not sure what 
sense '-delta_fair' would make - "delta_fair" is the amount of time a 
nice-0 task would be entitled to - but this task might not be a nice-0 
task. Furthermore, even for a nice-0 task why deduct -delta_fair - it 
spent delta_exec on the CPU.
