We are only talking about the local_irq_disable()/enable() in drivers, not
the core system, right? Therefore making it into a mutex will not be that
expensive overall.

The more I think about it the more dangerous I think it is. What does
local_irq_disable() protect against? All local threads as well as
irq-handlers. If these sections keeped mutual exclusive but preemtible we
will not have protected against a irq-handler.
I will start to play around with the following:
1) Make local_irq_disable() stop compiling to see how many we are really
talking about.
2) Make local_cpu_lock, which on PREEMPT_RT is a rt_mutex and on
!PREEMPT_RT turns into local_irq_disable()/enable() pairs. To introduce
this will demand some code-analyzing for each case but I am afraid there
is no general one-size solution to all the places.
