I don't see why that matters to you. You only need one cvsup able 
machine to sync the local repository. Once it's local, you can check out 
any tree from it using CVS as usual. There is no difference between 
cvsup and rsync in that respect. I'm not sure where and how the sparc 
tree is held, as I understand it's not in the main tree (but is it in 
the main repository?).
In any case, I'm not even sure that cvsup CAN run without an underling 
rsync server. I simply don't know. I do know that cvsup uses rsync for 
files it cannot optimize using its own algorithm.
