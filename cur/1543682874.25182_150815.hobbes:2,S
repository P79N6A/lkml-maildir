Testing it right now on top of 2.6.0-test1-mm2 :-)
Overall it feels better. I can't make XMMS skip at all. Under low load,
X is very smooth, but X is still jerky/jumpy when the system is under
heavy load (while true; do a=2; done) and I start moving windows all
around my KDE desktop. Renicing the X server to -20 makes it very smooth
under load (yeah, I know I shouldn't do this).
I'm playing a bit with tunables to see if I can tune the scheduler a
little bit for my system/workload. I've had good results reducing max
timeslice to 100 (yeah, I know I shouldn't do this too).
Will keep you informed :-)
