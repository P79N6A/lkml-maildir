Sigh. We keep getting these kinds of questions long after the fix has
been posted N times. I've finally pulled my finger out and gotten
around to doing something I've been planning:
There is a new page:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/kernel-newsflash.htm
which contains urgent fixes for the latest official kernel. There is
also a link to this page from the kernel-list FAQ.
Please, people, if a new kernel falls over in a heap, read this page
first. Help conserve electrons.
Linus: feel free to refer to this page in subsequent announcements. It
may serve as a pre-emptive reminder. Well, I can hope, anyway...
				Regards,
					Richard....
