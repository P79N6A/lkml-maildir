Sure, just wanted to point it out.

Yeah but in mac80211 we have the wiphy concept since multiple virtual
interfaces can be associated to one hardware, and that is where QoS is
done, not the netdevs. Of course, those interested can just listen to
nl80211 events to figure out if someone renamed a 802.11 phy, but things
like hal would probably not want to and still know about the name
change.
