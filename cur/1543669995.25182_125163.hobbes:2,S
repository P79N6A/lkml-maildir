Yes sorry it's ck5's fault, it's b0rken. Use ck6 which is on the website now 
called ck6pre_2416030413_2.4.20.patch.bz2 It doesn't have the mem leak in ck5 
and has the interactivity patch removed. Ignore the pre name it's going to be 
renamed when I update my website et al. This should be as stable as ck4.
