I would suspect that the "filename" thing will be the biggest achilles
heel...
after all what does filename mean in a linux world with
* hardlinks
* chroot
* namespaces
* bind mounts
* unlink of open files
* fd passing over unix sockets
* relative pathnames
* multiple threads (where one can unlink+replace file while the other is
in the validation code)
