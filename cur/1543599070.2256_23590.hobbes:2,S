I can't answer what this is, but I can point you to a prevous discussion
on the subject:

I assume that this is not a problem that you only get on 2.4.9-pre4, but
on any kernel version you try?
Drivers for other cards have also reported this (search on google).

Does unloading the modules and then reloading it help? (assuming you run
it as a module). ifconfig down/up is another variant some people have
used for other problems.
