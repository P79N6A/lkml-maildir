Yes.
Ingo, in general with CFS micro accounting, we should be able to avoid
penalizing the running task by tracking irq/softirq time. Isn't it?

I am not recommending SCHED_FIFO. I will take a look at softirq
infrastructure for this.

Nick remember that there are hundreds of disks in this setup and at
an instance, there will be max 1 or 2 requests per disk.

Ok. Currently the patch handles both direct and buffered IO. While making
improvements to this patch I will make sure that both the paths take
advantage of this.
