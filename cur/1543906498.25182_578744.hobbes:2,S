How should gcc know whether you actually wanted that char foo[len] to
contain a \0 as last element?
Given the respective command line switches, gcc does warn in some cases
where it is guesswork whether what you typed is what you intended.  For
example
	if (i = j())
is reason for gcc to warn even if that might exactly be what you wanted.
However this construct can easily be annotated as
	if ((i = j()))
to show to gcc and to carbon-based bipedals that you indeed wanted this.
Now there is no nice way to make an annotation that says "look, I'm
going to initialize an array of char with a string literal now, and the
resulting array will contain a non-zero member as last element, and I
mean it".  And since there is no such annotation possible, gcc does not
warn and demand that you annotate the perfectly valid and 100%
spec-compliant construct char a[4] = "1234";.
