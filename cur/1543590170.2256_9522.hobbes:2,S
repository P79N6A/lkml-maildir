Yes, they already support all current LVM volumes (including snapshots).
However, the user-space tools to set up new LVM volumes and manage existing
ones is not ready yet.  The last I talked with the IBM folks (a week ago),
they said they were starting to work on the user-space tools.
Because the whole partition/volume code is modular in EVMS, they will be able
to handle AIX LVM, HP/UX LVM, etc. volumes in addition to the normal DOS or
other partitions.
Cheers, Andreas
