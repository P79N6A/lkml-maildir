Understood. That is the last piece to the puzzle.
I think the first approach would be better as
synclink.h is all interface definitions. The kernel
specific parts are in the individual synclink drivers
(such as register definitions, etc). The only exception
to this is now the ioctl32 structures and I would hate
to break out a whole new header just for that.
Thanks again for your targeted and informative help.
(Thanks to Andrew for your patience in dealing
with a patch that never should have been submitted.)
