A few days ago my kernel 2.1.131 Oop on me the first time since the day
it was released. I'm not sure what triggered it, but it must be a weir
circumstance because it was doing fine for almost a month. My problem is
this; I can't switch to another kernel that I have . My old kernel also
have problem boot up.
What else were messed up? system map? I like to know how to clean this
mess up. Otherwise I have to format the partition and start over.
Vanh.
