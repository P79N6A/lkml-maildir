I assume that's because:
2643  syslog(0x6, 0, 0)                 = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
but cap_syslog() has disallowed command 6 for a long time.
It seems reasonable to be able to kill console messages if the user is
using the console, but from my reading current 2.4 kernels will fail this
if you're not root as well.
With what kernel were you able to run `setterm -msg' without being root?
