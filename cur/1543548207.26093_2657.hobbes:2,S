As a temporary work-around, try a 'append="mem=NNN"' in lilo.conf. So far
everybody who has had symptoms like this has been sucessful booting after
forcing a different memory size than what Linux is interpreting what
the BIOS reports. It is quite probably a bug, probably a boundary
condition with certain amounts of RAM. 
If you have two or more memory "sticks", just remove one and attempt to
boot from your floppy. This might tend to prove the theory.
