Stable?  Yes.  But it's not modular nor compatible with current efforts
like 2.4 cardbus or 2.4 hotplug pci or 2.5 device mode.  If one cannot
do
	modprobe piix4_ide
and have the right things happen automatically, the system is not
modular.  If it doesn't use the PCI API, it's implementing CardBus
support in a non-standard way if at all.

I do.  I am talking about a HOST api here.

Why not work with Patrick to make sure his device model properly
supports disks?
