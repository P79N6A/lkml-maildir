Both should work. "Other OS" changes how the promise cards I have map
the IDE controllers and whether the I2O asks the OS for space or not.
Does your BIOS also change the PCI class or pci idents ?

Shouldnt be needed now days

Use 2.4.19 or later. The promise stuff freaks if you do clever cache
hints and older kernels don't know about that

7) Sell the promise card to someone who doesnt know better and buy
a 3ware. Certainly under Linux the 3ware is way faster

SX4000 is i2o or something stranger ?
