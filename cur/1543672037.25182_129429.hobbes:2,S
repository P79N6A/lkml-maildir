the ASCII-armor, more precisely, is between addresses 0x00000000 and
0x0100ffff. Ie. 16 MB + 64K. [in the remaining 64K the \0 character is in
the second byte of the address.] So the 0x01003fff address is still inside 
the ASCII-armor.

i'm not using any binary-only drivers, so i have no idea. But as long as
they use PROT_EXEC areas for code, they should be safe.
