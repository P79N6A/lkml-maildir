Looks okay to me. I do have a concern about all the extra indirections we're
acquiring by this mad rush to centralise everything. It's going to slow things
down and consume more stack space. Is there any way we can:
 (1) Make a sys_ptrace() *jump* to arch_ptrace() instead of calling it, thus
     obviating the extra return step.
 (2) Drop the use of lock_kernel().
Otherwise, the patch looks valid:
