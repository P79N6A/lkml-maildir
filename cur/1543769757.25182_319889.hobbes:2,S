It was nice if you would name the points why you think Solaris packages 
are that inferior to e.g. RPM or dpkg packages.
E.g. if you know a standard way how to get the same functionality as 
request/pkgask in Solaris packages for RPM packages I'd be glad to hear 
about.
Not that I'd claim that Solaris packages were perfect.
Some examples:
- Solaris packages don't support upgrades of packages.
- I know in neither RPM nor Solaris packages a mechanism similarly 
  powerful to the dpkg diversions.
I'd personally say dpkg is the best of this three package formats. But I 
have to admit that RPM is the one amongst them I know the least, and you 
can correct my statements regarding RPM if you know better.
But altogether, I don't see any of these three package formats being 
hopelessly inferior to the other two.

You said:
  Finally SUN should move from the pkg* abortion, written by idiots
  at AT&T, some 25 years ago to RPM.
If you call people "idiots", you should at least be able to give some 
hard facts where exactly they should have done something different based 
on the knowledge that was available at the time they did it.
And it seems you also missed that the Solaris package format has evolved 
over the years.
