Just to mention something which has to be very clear..
I'm doing this in my spare time, for the linux community and as an a
personal challenge.. in **no way other organization is involved**. THIS
HAS TO BE VERY CLEAR.
I understand theres at least one person from mimio here **please** if you
understand I'm doing something which I'm not allowed to do, let me know
and I will stop in a nanosecond.
Thank you very much indeed.
