Not quite so, it's because the ->map serve as both a pin and address map
helper. The splice stuff doesn't actually need the kmap(), only for the
case where we have to copy the page. And it would be just as easy to
map that ourselves in that case.
There's a comment about that in the splice file.

The page cache stuff still needs to sanity check the page, before
allowing the caller to map it, so it cannot go. But it can be optimized.
