For LRW, the tweak is exactly as large as the bulk data itself, so
tweaksize = blocksize. Yes, it is usually generated and sequential, but
that may not be the case. I like to put the generation of the tweaks at
the client side, because it knows best where the tweaks come from and if
it likes fragmented tweaks or not.
Further, this interface is more naturally to any other tweakable cipher
mode. In contrast to a regular cipher:
E: {0,1}^k  x  {0,1}^n -> {0,1}^n
a tweakable cipher is:
E: {0,1}^k  x  {0,1}^t  x  {0,1}^n -> {0,1}^n
where k is key size, n block size and t is tweak size.

In the special case of LRW, it would be possible to squeeze it into an
IV styled interface, which does auto-incrementation. But that's flawed.
It would put functionality, where it does not belong. Witha  tweakable
mode, the blocks are independent and are not linked in any way. The
interface should reflect this.

The LRW cipher mode is stateless. There is context information, but this
only a cache. Same applies for EME, and it's fellows.
