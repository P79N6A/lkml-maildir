The following patch seems to cure my problem, I'm not sure yours
is the same.
I'm not absolutely sure about the corectness of the patch, but I
believe that kernel_thread should not be called with interrupts
disabled.
I'll leave up to the ieee1394 developpers to decide if some other,
semaphore based, locking is still necessary here.
Stelian.
