I thought it would.  (The submissions docs make all sorts of nasty noises 
about posting attachments to the list. I guess I will have to do it

I was going to include you on the Cc: list as well.  Right after I hit send.  
D'oh!
Here is the patch attached. Tested on 2.4.17 and 2.5.1. (Needs a version for

BTW, this was written during the PLUG meeting last night. (Which you missed.)
