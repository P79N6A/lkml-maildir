i think Zach's phhttpd is an important milestone as well, it's the first
userspace webserver that shows how to use event-based, sigio-based async
networking IO and sendfile() under Linux. (I believe it had some
performance problems related to sigio queue overflow, these issues might
be solved in the latest kernels.) The zerocopy enhancements should help
phhttpd as well.
