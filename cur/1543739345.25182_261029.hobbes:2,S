initramfs/initrd comes up very early in the boot process. For example
it holds your supplemental device drivers and initial /dev.
/dev/console is opened from this /dev so it much be up before the
console is. This is much earlier than normal user space starts.
I believe the current Fedora 3 uses udev from initramfs, but I haven't
tried it yet.
