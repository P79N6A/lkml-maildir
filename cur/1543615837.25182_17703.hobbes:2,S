Subject: Re: [patch] block-highmem-all-18b
Erk... I applied this patch to 2.2.16pre1 on a 2GB SMP machine with an
onboard aic7899 scsi controller. This morning I came in to find the
machine had panicked with "Ththththaats all folks.  Too dangerous to
continue." 
There was nothing else in syslog either remotely or on disk, and nothing
else on the console apart from the panic.
Any ideas what might cause this?
Let me know if I can provide any further information.
