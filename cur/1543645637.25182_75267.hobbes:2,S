Subject: [PATCH][RFC] oprofile for 2.5.40
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here is a new version of oprofile against 2.5.40.
As before, the full patch is available here :
http://oprofile.sf.net/oprofile-2.5/oprofile-2.5-all.diff
 [93k]
with usage notes :
http://oprofile.sf.net/oprofile-2.5.html
and more readable broken-out patches (but not applyable) :
http://oprofile.sf.net/oprofile-2.5/
Changes from the last version
o remove the ctx switch hook
o make event buffer be untyped ulong[] and use escapes for changing
  cpu/context/cookie. This reduces the amount of data considerably.
o use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
o more fixes and cleanups
Does anybody want to try this out ?
regards
john
