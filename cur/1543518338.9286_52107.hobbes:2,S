Hi folks,
yesterday I installed Redhat 6.1 (2.2.13 kernel redhat's one) on a Dual Pentium
box with HX chipset (GIgabyte mainboard), with on board AHA UW SCSI controller.
The box has a Gigabit NIC 3COM, (acenic kernel module).
I plan to use this box as NFS file server but the box crashes sometime when
an other linux client (redhat 6.1) tries to mount the exported filesystem.
There are no messages in the syslog file after a reboot it seems a hard lockup.
Is this NFS hang SMP , SCSI or networking code reladed ?
Is there a way to use the userspace nfs daemon instead of the knfsd under
Redhat, or am I forced to recompile the kernel (disabling knfsd support).
thank you for infos,
cheers,
Benno.
