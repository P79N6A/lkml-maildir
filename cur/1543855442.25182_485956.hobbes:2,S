This patch is needed only for lock/unlock commands. So, it's necessary to
make MMC omap works when using that feature. It's not a generic patch.
But I can take off this one from the series and send after (if) the series
is integrated.

frame depends on data->blksz. When we were using data->blksz_bits everything was
ok because we always had a multiple of 16 bits (2 bytes). Once a pwd can has a size
not multiple of 2, the value must be rounded.
According to MMC OMAP Technical Reference Manual, because of each DMA transfer is of
equal size, it is necessary to have the block size of the transfer be a multiple of
the DMA write access size (which is 2 bytes).
I'm not a DMA expert, If I misunderstand something, please, correct me.
