To clarify, the danger here is that an exit_signal=-1 leader would
self-reap and leave behind live threads with dangling ->group_leader
pointers.  This danger doesn't exist for normal user group leaders with
parents ignoring SIGCHLD, because exit_signal is never set to -1 until
do_notify_parent, which is never called until the last thread in the group
dies (except when ptrace'd, but then do_notify_parent never resets
exit_signal at all).  Is that right?

It probably wouldn't hurt to make it:
	if (user_mode(regs))
		BUG_ON(current->group_leader->exit_signal == -1);
	else
		BUG_ON((clone_flags & (CLONE_THREAD|CLONE_UNTRACED))
		       != CLONE_UNTRACED);

Yes, I agree it looks superfluous.

It does prevent the delivery (signal_pending() never set), but not the queuing.

That sounds reasonable to me generally.  However, if kernel threads ever
spawn user children, they may not want the self-reaping behavior of
ignoring SIGCHLD even if they never dequeue the signal (because they want
to call do_wait).  There might be other strange caveats like that I'm not
thinking of.  
Thanks,
