Could it be that creative has taken an interest in linux as a platform
to support their products on?  I'm sure we would all welcome this.
Linux is a term that really refers to the underlying working of the
linux operating system, the kernel.  All distributions contain the linux
kernel, which is developed separately.  Therefore, when writing drivers
for the linux operating system it should work for all distributions
(redhat, debian, slackware etc).
Hope this helps,
Phil
