Subject: directory walking faster on 2.4.8-ac8?

I deleted the last message in the mentioned thread, but I tried out
2.4.8-ac8 and directory walking didn't seem any faster than 2.4.4 (unless
there are special circumstances)?
ls -l <dir> | wc -l
2.4.8-ac8:
directory with 1336 subdirectories underneath: 13 secs
 915: 8  secs
 795: 8  secs
 336: 3  secs
2.4.4:
1336: 12 secs
 915: 8  secs
 795: 11 secs
 336: 3  secs
am i missing something?
