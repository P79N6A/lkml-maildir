Yes, it's really needed: checking UTF-8 mode by measuring cursor motion is
a pain, with side effects of flushing stdin. I need to examine the whole
translation mode info in one tool.
I wonder if its ever possible to put this interface into xterm and telnet.
BTW, where can I ask about framebuffer? Will it be possible to load more
than 512 characters? Will it be compatible with dosemu in its "graphics",
"non-console" mode? How to set fonts with a non-8 width? How about drivers
for various SVGA cards? My S3 Virge requires DOS univbe for VESA 2.0 - it
works, but is it safe - can Linux corrupt univbe's code, or maybe it uses
it only to switch the mode on?

Now it seems to work perfectly, thanks! Hope all this will get into the
official kernel at the appropriate time.
Oh, one more thing: Linux standard line discipline erases only a single
byte with Backspace, even in UTF-8 mode, although on the screen the cursor
goes back the whole character. This needs fixing.

I'll look at it. Can it do more than Yann Dirson's console-tools

console-tools-1998.08.11.tar.gz>?
