IMO the main points/questions are:
- where to document the command-line options and environment variables
  (including the recent KCONFIG_CONFIG):  in a usage() function or in
  Documentation/kbuild/usage.txt file?
- if the answer above is in a usage() function, how does a user invoke
  that help request?  Doing "make config -h" doesn't work: 'make' sees
  the -h and spits out its own help text.  Would a special case of
  'make config help' be acceptable or is this a good reason to use
  a usage.txt file instead?
- or have you already taken care of all of this?  8;)
Thanks.
