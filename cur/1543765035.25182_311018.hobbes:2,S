It isn't enough. The same compiler and the same .config - yes. But that
means you'd have no progress within, say, 2.6. Only bug fixes.
There _is_ a tree like that - 2.6.11.Xs are only bugfixes.
But remember that changing a single config option may make your kernel
incompatible. You can't avoid that without making the kernel suboptimal
for most situations - basically you'd have to disable non-SMP builds,
disable (or permanently enable) 4KB pages etc.
If you make a proprietary closed-sourse system (with kernel modules), you
probably have to make the system suboptimal. But with open source there
is a better alternative.

Asking for one modules dir only is similar to asking for only one
/boot/vmlinuz-2.6 kernel file.

First, each 2.6.X would have to be binary-compatible with itself.
