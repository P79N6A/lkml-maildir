The other problem besides the inability to handle IO errors is that 
mmap()+msync() is synchronous.  You need to go async to keep the 
pipelines full.
Now if someone wants to implement an aio version of msync and mlock, 
that might do the trick.  At least for MMU systems.  Non MMU systems 
just can't play mmap type games.
