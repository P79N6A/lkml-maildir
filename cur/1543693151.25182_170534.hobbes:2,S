don't disable local_irq , because no irq involved
don't know how expensive a local_irq_save is on SMP

msg_bytes is local to posixqueue.c
if I use the SysV queue code, I use its storage. What do you mean by
accounting? Whatever security_msg_msg_alloc() does?
We have no enforcable user limits on queues (in context of ulimits).

yes, I will try that.

Userspace translates SIGEV_THREAD to something that uses SIGEV_SIGNAL.
Ulrich made a suggestion to use a futex, but I think of something even
more lightweight. Just put the requestor right to sleep.
No further syscall involved (and avoids a race inbetween sys_mq_notify
and sigsuspend).
