My only feeling with zones is that it could be useful in the non numa cases,
if it was per zone. 
But unless this API becomes is a pure hint we need at least one specifier that 
says writing to swap is o.k.

Simple is good only if the proper pieces are connected.

It makes it terribly unpredictable.  If you have two threads each bound
to a different location there are race conditions which area the memory
is allocated from.

Actually the bindings need to stick to the vma or to the struct address_space.
Otherwise you are talking about an allocation hint, as swapping can trivially
undue it and nothing happens when the actual call is made.  A hint is a very
different thing from a binding.
And if we stick this to struct address_space for the non anonymous cases
having a fmem_setbinding(struct fd) that works on files would be a useful
thing as well.

For a binding with respect to memory I imagine things like mlock().  For
anything else you are talking a future hint to the memory allocators, which
feels less much useful.
