I can give counter-examples of times when it's been extremely useful to 
know exactly what version the user is running, and the info messages
included in their first bug report have told me exactly what I needed to 
know.

Only for code which is always distributed as part of the kernel, and where 
there are never any more up to date versions in the maintainer's tree, even 
temporarily.
Also consider the question "What was the last thing you see on screen 
before it reboots?"
