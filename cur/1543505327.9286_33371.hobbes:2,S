One comment for those of you taking the attitude that "Linux will never
support software based modems". You are to late, it already does. look in
the Ham section. There is support for hardware modems (TNC's) and sound
card based modems. While I agree that in most cases software based modems
are not a good idea I can see many places where a type 1 modem (as defined
below) would be reasonable for a low-end "internet terminal" type of
device.
