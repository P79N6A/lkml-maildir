Same problem, but with a 2940U2W scsi board.
Never tried 2.4.0 but I tried old and new AIC driver with no succes
Both in UP, UP+APIC and SMP kernel (2.4.4-acx and 2.4.5+).
You have more luck than me: removing all other boards in my box
change nothing.
My motherboard is an old asus P/I-P65UP5/C-P55T2D (bi p5 233MMX 
430HX chipset)
Fortunately my old 2940UW still works flawlessly.
Emmanuel.
