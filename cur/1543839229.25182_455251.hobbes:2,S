Lockdep still detects this bug
=======================================================
[ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
-------------------------------------------------------
events/0/8 is trying to acquire lock:
 (memleak_lock){++..}, at: [<c0176a11>] memleak_free+0x9e/0x16f
but task is already holding lock:
 (&parent->list_lock){++..}, at: [<c0174f29>] drain_array+0x49/0xad
which lock already depends on the new lock.
etc.
