Ah, it does not need to be that complex.
Just comparing two approaches:
--1--
/* KERNEL: Calling read() on a character device */
static int u_read(...) {
   ...
   gettimeofday(tv);
   enqueue_in_buffer(tv);
   ...
}
+nothing needed in userspace
--2--
/* KERNEL: No gettimeofday */
Userspace:
while(read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)) {
    gettimeofday(&buf.tv);
    ...
}
(In either case, at some point, userspace has a timestamp.)
I think that -1- is faster it does not require an additional syscall from
userspace to sys_gettimeofday().
