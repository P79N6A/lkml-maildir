Looking back at the objects that were built they are:
./busses/i2c-amd756.o
./chips/adm1021.o
./chips/lm75.o
I guess its a bad thing if they hang if the hardware isn't present - I'd
presumed it was possible to build them all and they'd just use which
ever are actually present. (How do I know which I've got?)

Hmm - its a while since I last tried it I think; I'm reasonably sure
I've had some working in the past).
