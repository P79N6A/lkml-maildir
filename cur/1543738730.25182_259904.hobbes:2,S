Precedence: bulk

i've uploaded -T6:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-T6
this should fix the UP build issues reported by many. -T6 also brings
back the ->break_lock framework and converts a few more locks to raw.
SMP is still expected to be flaky due to the zombie-task problem(s). But
UP is not out of the 'extremely experimental' status either.
to create a -T6 tree from scratch the patching order is:
