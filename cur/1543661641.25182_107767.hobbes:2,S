There are not in the 2.4.21-pre patch, because the 2.4.20 got mixed with
another patch. The limiting of number of queue requests is a different
patch, and it's quite likely it will provide better interactiveness for
you. But it will also considerably drop throughput, depends on the work
load whether that's the case or not.
I don't think ext3 will show a performance boost with the supplied
patch, but the stuff for reiser that Christ did definitely will.
