Yes, I think different transport (like netlink) is better suited as a
generic notification transport. Input devices are pretty "heavy"
objects to add them everywhere.

I want to add the ability to add "filetrs" to i8042 keyboard ports so
that certain bytes that represent state changes (battery events,
wireless, etc.) can be diverted from keyboard serio port (and atkbd
driver) and be processed by a separate driver(s).

My position is that we should not cram all notifications into input
layer. We need something lighter and more flexible, that can mix
together battery charging, brightness increased, network link appeared
type of events. Maybe something like dbus strings + originating sysfs
device.
