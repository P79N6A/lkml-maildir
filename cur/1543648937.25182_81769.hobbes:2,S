Hi,
  Under RedHat 8, when two cpu intensive processes are running at nice 19 
on my smp system, top will report both 100% cpu for both user and nice.  
The same is true for 7.3.
  With procps-3.0.4 this seems to be fixed.  Although the 'hide threads' 
code seems to be missing, or at least not working.  It would be nice to 
have both.
Just my $.02 USD,
Scott
