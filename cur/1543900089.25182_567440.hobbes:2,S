Subject: [patch 2.6.22] gpio calls don't need i/o barriers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Clarify that drivers using the GPIO operations don't need to issue
io barrier instructions themselves.  Previously this wasn't clear,
and at least one platform assumed otherwise (and would thus break
various otherwise-portable drivers which don't issue barriers).

 If you stick to this convention then it'll be easier for other developers to
