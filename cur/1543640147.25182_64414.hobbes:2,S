I use them exclusively.
It is far and away the most convenient parsing - just to do "make
oldconfig"  (possibly by making changes by hand to the .config file
first).
As far as I'm personally concerned, the shell parsers are the _only_ 
parser that really matter. So if you want to replace them with something 
else, that something else had better be pretty much perfect and not take 
all that long to build.
