Seems kobject_create_and_register would be replaced by
kobject_create_and_add, and the uevent handling would be separated
from original create_and_register onefunction.
wait for greg's patches or modify to use:
kobject_init
kobject_add
kobject_uevent
BTW, I suspect whether the uevent is really needed for boot_params object.
