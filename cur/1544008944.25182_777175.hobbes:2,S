Yeah. Frans' workaround was
 - unloading e1000e before suspend
 - using aggressive powersave setting on snd_hda_intel to ensure that
   sound controller was already sleeping before entering suspend
and both of those devices are on the root PCI bus and are enumerated (and 
thus resumed) before the transparent bridge.
So yeah, the whole "resource allocation for that bridge" saga should 
_really_ not matter. But it clearly does seem to.
