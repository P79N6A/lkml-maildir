This one I think is valid. Considering how many people seem to care, I 
think we should keep it as the only valid case for now.

I don't much care. I was taught English spelling in school, and I've 
gotten used to US spelling here.
I think you guys who care should have a huge free-for-all, an electronic
mud-wrestling thing if you will. But not on linux-kernel. 
I can see it now:
   ".. Alan Cox gets up, and tackles Zwane, who goes down in the mud.  
    Oops.  They were on the same side. I guess Alan got caught up in the
    rush.  Jasper tries to take advantage of the situation, but slips in
    the mud, and goes down in a heap with Alexander..."
Tell me when it's over.
