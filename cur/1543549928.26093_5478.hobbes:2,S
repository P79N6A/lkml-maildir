I just tested this using my perl-5.005-threads program... no change from
my last email (only 1023 threads created, program fails to respond to
ctrl-c when more than 1023 threads are attempted).  This _appears_ to be a
bug in perl-5.005-threads as shipped with debian potato.
Using Mark Hahn's test code, I get all 2000 threads successfully created,
and they respond properly when killed via ctrl-c.  So that appears to fix
the problem.
ASSUMING the perl-5.005-thread problem is indeed a perl problem I think
this solves the kernel crash problem.  (NOTE, I have test this with
max_queued_signal at 4096 and 1024... no difference for either perl or
Mark's code.)
I'll get the source to perl-5.005-thread and play with it later tonight.
