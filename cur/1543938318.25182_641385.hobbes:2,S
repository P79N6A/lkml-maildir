We still need to be able to construct those page tables, which is what 
that stuff is about...

If so, adjusting the limit should be a separate patch.
Either way, I'm increasingly thinking that setting up the initial page 
tables via an assembly loop instead of worrying about the C accessors is 
actually cleaner (I prototyped it yesterday, although I still need the 
rest of the machinery.)
