Just proof of concept really, to have an equivalent of "try_to_unmap()" - 
which you call from the migrate page code. 
Just that "try_to_remap_{file,anon}" do the pte clearing + remapping in
one function.

The page migration code (p000*) looks nice - quite complete indeed (nice error
handling, etc) but somewhat specific to the migration procedure, which is more 
critical (cannot fail so easily as) then the remapping for high-order allocations.
For example this in migrate_page_common
+		switch (ret) {
+		case 0:
+		case -ENOENT:
+			copy_highpage(newpage, page);
+			return ret;
+		case -EBUSY:
+			return ret;
+		case -EAGAIN:
+			writeback_and_free_buffers(page);
+			unlock_page(page);
+			msleep(10);
+			timeout -= 10;
+			lock_page(page);
+			continue;
Which retries undefinately to migrate the page
For the "defragmentation" operation we want to do an "easy" try - ie if we
can't remap giveup.
I feel we should try to "untie" the code which checks for remapping availability / 
does the remapping from the page migration - so to be able to share the most 
code between it and other users of the same functionality. 
Curiosity: How did you guys test the migration operation? Several threads on 
several processors operating on the memory, etc?

Cool. I'll take a closer look at the relevant parts of memory hotplug patches 
this weekend, hopefully. See if I can help with testing of these patches too.
Andrew, what are your thoughts wrt merging this to mainline?
