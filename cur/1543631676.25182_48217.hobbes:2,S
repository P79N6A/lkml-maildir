I don't see the point of this...

?? do you mean use of -oremount ?  possible, I suppose. Doesn't seem much 
better than (1) to me though.

Yes. Do this, or something like it.
AFAIK, Windows "hidden" files are supposed to behave much like Unix 'dot' 
files (.login, etc), so IMO the kernel should not use the hidden bit at all. 
Instead, it should be 'ls' et al that do this. Now, I guess this isn't 
particularly practical without changing fileutils and many other things, so I 
would suggest that the kernel is changed to pass on, if possible, but 
basically ignore the 'hidden' bit.

Ruth
