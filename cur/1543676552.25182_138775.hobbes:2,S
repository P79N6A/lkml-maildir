    I see that only one architecture defines __NR_sysfs: x86-64, though it
    appears most architectures mention it in arch/*/kernel/entry.S (or 
    equivalent).
There are definitions in include/asm-*/unistd.h.
    Is it used anymore? Would it be possible to remove it? 
There should be a good reason to change the kernel API.
Just "why not remove this probably unused call?" is not a good reason.
(It indeed is almost unused. A grep on a random source tree shows
a use in mount.c in busybox.)
