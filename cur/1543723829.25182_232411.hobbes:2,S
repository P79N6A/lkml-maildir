Ok, but still nobody seems to know why the super user is not allowed to
access /proc/<PID>/mem of any task. Any code which nobody in the world
knows the reason for, is broken and should be removed.
I will wait a few weeks to see if someone does come up with the reason for
that "extra secure" check in mem_read() and if nobody has objections I'll
send Linus a patch to relax the check to a more reasonable one, namely to
allow CAP_SYS_PTRACE process to bypass any other conditions imposed.
Kind regards
