FYI, the core of another, more widely used open-source RTOS, eCos [2],
is written in C++ as well though it supports C for drivers development
and its public interface is C wrapper around the C++ core.
On the other hand, I think I do understand Linux hackers` worries about
C++ leaking into the Linux kernel. For many supporting C++, even in the
modules only, is only slightly different from supporting binary drivers,
I guess. That could be in fact very serious problem, I'm afraid.
