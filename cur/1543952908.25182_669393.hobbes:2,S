commit 513f484dfe5cbb53e73ef1729703e7030e799487 breaks compilation
with X86_VISW.
I don't have enough knowledge of the subtles of those things, so I'm
just reporting it.
But my educated guess is that it shouldn't be static, and the answer
to the question that goes in the end of the commit log is "yes" ;-)
