More pragmatically, who cares? There's already at least one vendor
(Cisco) who ships a perfectly good fully GPLed iSCSI initiator module
that doesn't need to touch any core code. It's already the benchmark
for compatibility at interoperability tests. And it's following the
IETF drafts closely too. Once we actually have an iSCSI RFC, it might
be worth pulling it into the kernel tree. I believe Red Hat is
shipping it some form already.
That leaves the question of using Linux as an iSCSI target, and I've
yet to see any reason why this couldn't be done in userspace. In fact,
in a lot of ways that's the right thing to do as it lets you take
proper advantage of MD/LVM/EVMS/crypto, etc..
There are a few other free implementations out there too.
