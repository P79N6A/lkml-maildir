Hey again,
First: my hardware, motherboard is VIA KT-400 based Epox 8K9A series. My mouse 
(the one not working under 2.6.0-*) is (according to 2.4.21-pre6) Logitech 
USB-PS/2 Mouse. This mouse works under linux 2.4-series and Windows XP 
flawlessly.
But under 2.6.0-series it doesnt work. More:

So it seems that it timeouts. I don't have a clue about USB kernel code, so I 
really don't know where to go from here. I'm attaching the whole kernel log 
where you can see all the verbose USB messages.
