I think you're confusing what I mean by tasks and processes.  A task is
something with a task_struct and a kernel stack.  A process is a single
task, or multiple tasks that share an mm.   If things share an mm, they
share pagetables implicitly.  Per-process _is_  per memory context.

Large pages aren't used for generic user memory at all.  That would take
some serious surgery.  (Don't get Bill started on it :)
