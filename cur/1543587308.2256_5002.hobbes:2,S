CML2 seems to have two other problems in my mind. Inability to parse the
existing config files. Also the draw ordering in the menu based config doesnt
appear right. Menuconfig has a rather undocumented but very important property
of doing roughly the right thing with screenreaders. Something to bear in mind
when fixing the menu redrawing stuff.
