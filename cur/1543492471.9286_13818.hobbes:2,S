The  content  of executable  files  never  carried around  special
privileges in Unix, they are  always stored in metadata. And never
are  such   privileges  carelessly  copied   around.  Transfer  of
privileges  needs   careful  considerations  and   itself  special
privileges.  For example  even if  you  can read  /bin/login as  a
normal  user  you  can  not  copy  its  privilege  with  the  file
content.  The  only reasonable  approach  is  that  all tools  and
transfer protocols, that are  not aware of capabilities, erase all
capabilities  by  default. This  means  that  default behavior  of
system calls  (open,creat etc.) has  to be set  accordingly.  This
also means  that transfer protocols  (NFS), that are not  aware of
capabilities, do not transfer capabilities.
