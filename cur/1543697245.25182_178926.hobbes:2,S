Really, what i think here is appropriate is a more fundamental approach.
We should reserve a new partition type in addition to three already
existing, namely "linux"==0x83, "linux swap"==0x82 and "linux lvm"==0x8e.
And call it something like "linux suspend".
And initialize it, if needed (i presume to write a signature etc), with
something like "mksusp".
