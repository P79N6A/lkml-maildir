OK, after finally getting my bits flipped correctly, I tested it again,
and it hung again. AIEE.
Now, a sanity check. I'm doing this with a kernel which is configured
with CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS=y and CONFIG_PCI_OPTIMIZE=y. Should it matter?
Should I only be trying this stuff with those configs turned off?
Strange that it still hangs. Argh.

|   Yes, that's what you want to end up with. My box originally had 0x50
|   == 0x88, running the script changes this into 0x50 == 0x80. Which

It was my dumb mistake, never mind :)
