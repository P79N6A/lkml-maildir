Changing a HFS partition from 2.6.0-test3 on ppc32 results
in messages like the following in the kernel's log:
hfs_cat_put: trying to free free entry: c5f382a0
hfs_cat_put: trying to free free entry: c5047460
(from 'touch /mnt/macos/Temp/junk')
hfs_cat_put: trying to free free entry: c5047460
hfs_cat_put: trying to free free entry: c5f382a0
(from 'sync' after the previous 'touch')
I don't know how serious these messages are, but they don't
appear when I'm using a 2.4 kernel.
(I install new kernels in a MacOS9/HFS partition because BootX
is the only boot loader that works on my OldWorld PowerMac.)
