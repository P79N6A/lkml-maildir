Does that mean that the 64 K changes imported from bk would take ~ 3 GB?
Is that real?
Have to tried to import it?
I'm going to import the CVS data (with cvsps) - as the CVS "misses" half
the changes, the resulting archive should be half in size too?
I don't know how much space did bk use, but 3 GB for the full history
is reasonable for most people, isn't it? Especially that one can purge
older data.
