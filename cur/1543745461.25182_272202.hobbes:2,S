Not entirely true at all. A network protocol can implement lazy binding
and
do implicit binding on the sendto. Other protocols might not actually
have
a receiving component so have no bind() functionality at all.

POSIX 1003.1g draft 6.4 permits a user to pass a "null" address for
various things. Indeed some systems implement send() as sendto() with a
NULL, 0 address component and some user space does likewise. It also has
a lot to say on the other cases although I don't think it ever fully got
past draft state.
You also want to look at TCP/IP illustrated to see some of the
assumptions handed down from on high by BSD and which should not be
broken.
