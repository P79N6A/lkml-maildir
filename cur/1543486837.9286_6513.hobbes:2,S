Working on a PCMCIA driver here.
Could anyone tell me about suggested PCMCIA driver behaviour on eject ?
As I understand, currently cards may happen to talk to empty slot if the
card is taken out in the middle of long driver operation ?
If it is not so, what is the mechanism that prevents it   or what is the
best way to be 100% sure about card being in slot ?
elmer.
