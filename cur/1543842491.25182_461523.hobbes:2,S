Thanks for review and suggestions. I'll try to run these tests next week.
Afaics, it is enough to just do
	for (;;) close(open(...))
for '2.'.

I think there was another reason to do set_need_resched() unconditionally,
but this is only my guess. We are sending IPIs to speedup the flashing of
callbacks we already have in the queue. But set_need_resched() tries to
suppress current process from adding new callbacks (not that it is perfect,
though). Consider the 'for (;;) close(open(...))' loop.
Actually I think it also makes sense to do tasklet_schedule(rcu_tasklet)
in call_rcu(), this way we can detect that we need to start the next batch
earlier.

This is not easy to do. rcu_start_batch() is "global", we need
to scan all per-cpu 'struct rcu_data' and check it's ->qlen.

Agree. Probably we don't need to check !rdp->donlist, it should be
empty after rcu_do_batch() invocation when ->qlen > qhimark, because
in that case ->blimit == INT_MAX.
But first I'd like to do a couple of other cleanups here, I'll send
the patches on weekend.
Thanks!
Oleg.
