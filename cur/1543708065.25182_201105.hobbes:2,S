I have a similar problem, and my aha1520 can't be moved off irq9 without 
cutting traces on the system board. How bad is it without ACPI at all? I 
tried that for a while, and several other things didn't work, and it 
looks as if the aha1520 driver won't share irq anyway, and something 
else (I forget) wants that irq as well.
I boot into 2.4 to do backups, fortunately the only thing on the SCSI.
