Now that argument I can buy.
There's still helper functions to be created before a native block 
driver can directly use struct requests for fully native queueing. 
Brand new device, host registration code.  PM, hotplug, yadda yadda.  It 
winds up being a lot of code still, and it not as simple as you and Jens 
seem to be making the task out to be.  That's why I brought up 
/dev/{disk,floppy,cdrom}...
If all that work is to be done for a brand new, native block driver, we 
should at least intend on using the code as a bus-agnostic command 
transport layer, with packages of helpers like my current "libata" doing 
the command set work (and sometimes, some amount of low-level driver 
work, where commonality exists).
