 , dd1 is now at 60 MB/sec (slight plus), while dd2/dd3 suck the same way as in pre 2.6.24. The only test that is still good is mix3, which I attribute to the per-BDI stuff.

Martin,
I've backported Peter's perbdi patchset to 2.6.22.x.  I can share it
with anyone who might be interested.
As expected, it has yielded 2.6.24-rcX level scaling.  Given the test
result matrix you previously posted, 2.6.22.x+perbdi might give you
what you're looking for (sans improved writeback that 2.6.24 was
thought to be providing).  That is, much improved scaling with better
O_DIRECT and network throughput.  Just a thought...
Unfortunately, my priorities (and computing resources) have shifted
and I won't be able to thoroughly test Fengguang's new writeback patch
on 2.6.24-rc8... whereby missing out on providing
justification/testing to others on _some_ improved writeback being
included in 2.6.24 final.
Not to mention the window for writeback improvement is all but closed
considering the 2.6.24-rc8 announcement's 2.6.24 final release
timetable.
regards,
Mike
