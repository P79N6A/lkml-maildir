Gosh! I bought an ATI video card, I bought a VMware license, etc.... I 
want to keep using them. Changing a "stable" kernel will continuously 
annoy users and vendors.
I think new developments will force a 2.7 branch: when 2.6 feature set 
stabilizes, people will keep more time testing a stable, relatively 
static kernel base, finding bugs, instead of trying to keep up with 
changes.
