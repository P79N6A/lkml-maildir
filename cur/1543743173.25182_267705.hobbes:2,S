yes it should. I agree with Andrew a bitflag would be enough. I'd call
it PG_prot_none.
I realized if the page is in the freelist it's like if it's reserved,
since you're guaranteed there's no other pageattr working on it
(assuming every other pageattr is symmetric too, which we always depend
on). So I wonder why it's not symmetric already, despite the lack of
page->mapped. Would be nice to dump_stack when a __pg_prot(0) &&
page->mapped triggers.
