Maybe my english is bad ;)
With kernel 2.4.17, spicctrl -p shows an error message:
ioctl failed: Invalid argument
With kernel 2.4.18-pre9 it works fine, the only difference between the config 
is that I have enabled IO Device Support.
I don't know what this is and maybe I don' need it.
I've only activated it because of the error message (ioctl failed)
have fun
