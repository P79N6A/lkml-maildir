It's quite. With NR_CPUS==128 the current x86-64 code wastes around 4MB
in per CPU data :/

The problem is to tell all subsystems to reinitialize the data for possible
CPUs (essentially the concept of "possible" CPUs would need to go)  It would 
need an reaudit of a lot of code. Probably quite some work.
I think it is better to try to figure out how many hotplug CPUs are supported,
otherwise use a small default.  My current code uses disabled CPUs 
as a heuristic, otherwise half of available CPUs and it can be overwritten
by the user.
