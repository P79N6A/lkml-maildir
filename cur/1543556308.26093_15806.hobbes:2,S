If the benchmark writes blocks completely random, the random writing
performance should be used instead of the bandwidth.  It is tipically
30blk/s to 200blk/s depends on the seek speed.
90 second writing corresponds to 10MB to 72MB dirty buffer
(4K fs block), it is not so crazy.  But 30 minutes is still
too long on 256MB physical memory.
I think they are different, aren't they?
