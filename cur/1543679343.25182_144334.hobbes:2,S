I noticed.
However, not printing empty names makes the trace a lot more useful. 
Just doing a symbolic trace on modules on x86, I see pretty much the
correct call trace now.
But, I'll investigate and see if I can find a way of generically telling
if a particular symbol is useful or not.

Apart from the dubious writing to a const * pointer, yes I can (it's
what I'm doing now).  There is some annoyance in that module_finalize
isn't told where the string or symbol tables are, so I have to find them
again.
