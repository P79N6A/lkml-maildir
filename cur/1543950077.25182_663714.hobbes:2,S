i do this by using quilt ontop of git-bisect.
I do something like this:
  mkdir patches
  echo revert.patch > patches/series
  git-log -1 -p 62fb185130e4d420f > patches/revert.patch 
  git-bisect start
  git-bisect  bad v2.6.24-rc3
  git-bisect good v2.6.24
  quilt push           # the revert is applied
  [ test the kernel ]
  quilt pop            # revert is unapplied
  git-bisect bad       # if it's still bad
  quilt push           # apply the revert again
  [ test the next kernel ]
  quilt pop            # undo the revert
  git-bisect good      # if it's good
etc. NOTE: if the "quilt push" fails, it's likely because you are in a 
point in the tree that does not have the reverted commits applied yet. 
In that case there's no need to push/pop, just test the bisection point.
Note, since there are _two_ guilty commits here:
      commit 58e2d4ca581167c2a079f4ee02be2f0bc52e8729

      sched: group scheduling, change how cpu load is calculated
      commit 6b2d7700266b9402e12824e11e0099ae6a4a6a79
      Author: Srivatsa Vaddagiri <vatsa@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

      sched: group scheduler, fix fairness of cpu bandwidth allocation for task
make sure the bisection point is never "between" these two commits.
You can check whether a bisection point has the two guilty commits 
applied, via:
  git-log | grep -E '58e2d4ca581167c2a0|6b2d7700266b9402e12'
if this comes up empty, the guilty commits are not applied.
