Bridging between namespaces should not be a problem, but it could be
a bit of a challenge to setup (in finding the network devices).
Probably the easy way is to setup the bridging and then move one of the
network devices to the other network namespace.
Essentially bridging between two network devices in two network
namespaces looks like bridging between two network devices on two
separate network stacks.   Although internally things look a little
better.

IANAL but to me your code sounds like a derivative work of the linux
kernel.  Which implies that if you are distributing your module you
need to change to GPL licensing.  The _GPL tag on EXPORT_SYMBOL does
not change those rules.

Which is where it gets tricky   You are defining new userspace ABIs.
I can see where they occasionally make sense during development
and prototyping but long term out of tree userspace interfaces appear
to me to be a real maintenance problem.

The issue is that fundamentally all userspace device identifiers can
be duped between namespaces.  So since there is no unique identifier
we can not implement a function to do that.

Well I don't see a license compatible way to have any GPL incompatible
licensed linux kernel code.  Off hand that means code needs to be
licensed under the GPL or BSD without advertising clause.
Does EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL complain if you have a BSD licensed module?
