No, I can't be sure.  (Nevertheless I'm inclined to believe
this is rather a FIBMAP related kernel bug that has been
introduced after the current version of the convertfs toolset
was released in March 2002.)
Unfortunately at the moment I don't have a scratch partition
on any of my disks so I can't re-test on a live system.
