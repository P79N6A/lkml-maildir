FWIW, I think the -at() suffix is just fine, and well established by now 
(yes, there is shmat, but the SysV shared memory interfaces are bizarre 
to begin with -- hence POSIX shared memory which has real names.)
What I object to is the random, meaningless and misleading application 
of the f- suffix.
