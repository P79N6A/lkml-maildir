Ok.

Well I thought of this already and tried my test case without any flags
but -Wall, with -O2 and -Os.  Same result.  I also compiled my test case
with the options used by the kernel (which ATM isn't compiled with -Os),
same thing.
I've attached to this email a tarball of what I use to test the
compiler/binutils.  It's faster than recompiling the whole kernel on
these slow machines!
