This comment should tell the reader which interrupt path that is (ie: sysrq-B).

I'm not sure that we want to make core PCI code capable of being called
from interrupt context just for the sake of sysrq-B.  It adds complexity
and maintenance hassles for something which is largely a debugging feature.
otoh, the patch is faily simple-looking and people _do_ use sysrq-B fairly
often so I guess we'll find out if we break it again.
otoh2, perhaps we can find some quicky hack on the sysrq patch to shut up
the might_sleep() warnings (which I presume is the only problem which is
presently being exhibited?).  Something like the unpleasant
oops_in_progress, perhaps.
Greg, any preferences?
