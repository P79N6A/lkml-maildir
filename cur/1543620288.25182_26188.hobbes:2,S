I can see that net driver relies on being able to disable all timers 
by doing in net/core/dev.c -
        tasklet_disable(bh_task_vec+TIMER_BH);
But this doesn't completely disable timers in Ingo's patch 
since timers can also be fired through run_local_timers() if 
locking succeeds, no TIMER_BH in that case.
There are only a few places where TIMER_BH is used. I will see if
I can make another smptimers patch that gets rid of them.
Thanks
