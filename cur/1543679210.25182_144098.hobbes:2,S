which is awfully difficult if you have, say, a 60GB filesystem, a 60GB
disk, and nothing else.

IMHO even if it requires the filesystem to be unmounted, it would
still be useful.  More challenging to use - you'd have to boot and run
from ramdisk, but much more useful than not being able to convert at all.

But useless unless you have a second disk lying around that you don't
use for anything but filesystem conversions.
