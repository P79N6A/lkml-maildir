Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86: GEODE add the "mfgptfix" boot time option to fix MFGPT timers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/23/372

The new "mfgptfix" boot command line option may be usd to fix MFGPT
timers on AMD Geode platforms when the BIOS has incorrectly applied
a workaround. TinyBIOS version 0.98 is known to be affected, 0.99
fixes the problem by letting the user disable the workaround.
