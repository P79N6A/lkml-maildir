Okay, so now I have two separate git repositories,
one for Linus's tree (currently at 2.6.12), and another
that is Jeff's libata-dev bundle of goodies.
But I have no idea whatsoever what to do next.
What I *want*, is the patchset for "passthru",
so that I can apply those patches to 2.6.12 and
then test that kernel.
But it is nowhere even remotely close to possibly perhaps
someday eventually maybe suggestively obvious how to do that.
Anyone care to volunteer the info?  Jeff?
Thanks
