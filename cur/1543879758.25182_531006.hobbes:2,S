Yeah, lack of PRETHAW support could be an issue.  As you may recall,
it was added because otherwise statically linked USB host controllers
came up under the mistaken belief that they were getting a real resume
event rather than a restart-after-power-off ... and there needed to be
a way to force a hard reset.  Seems like a similar issue here.
