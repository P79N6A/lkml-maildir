Manpage 'man 2 fork' says:
                 'File locks ... are not inherited.'
This is true for POSIX locks,  but not for flock-type locks.
This  phrase comes directly  from posix fork manpage,
which is not aware of flock-style locks.
Maybe fork manpage should rather say:
        ... POSIX file locks are not inherited (fcntl(2)).
        Flock-style locks are inherited (see flock(2)) ...
?
