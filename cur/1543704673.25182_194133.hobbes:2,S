I'm curious about the rationale behind breaking it up into multiple chunks.
udevsend being separate I assume is so that it can be easily called from 
a script while still keeping something persistant?
I'm not sure I see what separating udev and udevd into different 
binaries actually buys you.  Wouldn't it be just as easy to make udev be 
the daemon based on runtime options or something?
