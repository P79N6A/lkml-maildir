But using pnpacpi=no, I disable the acpi code.. the "normal" pnp code,
what does on suspend? Does it simply do nothing? In the dmesg I don't
see anything related to pnp device reinit.
I tried suspend to ram on this motherboard. A strange thing happens..
the system goes to suspend and then suddenly resumes. Why?
How I can check if it's enabled a wake up device? There are no related
settings on the bios, only wake on lan (disabled). I think I must
debug interrupts...
