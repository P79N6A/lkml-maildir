It may not be Mach, but MS *did* hire away the
entire Mach development group from CMU about 5 
years ago, starting with the head guy 
(Rick Rashid). They just about emptied the 
Spice Rack I think :-)
Not to mention they also hired DN Cutler of
RSX-11 fame. 
All that talent and they *still* can't build an
operating system! ;-)
