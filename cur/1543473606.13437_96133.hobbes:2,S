Political opinions aside (not that I don't agree with them, but I'd
imagine many others don't care) the ALSA drivers are better drivers
for audio, with full duplex support, support for Plug & Play, great
user space support libraries, better DMA support, fully modularised
drivers, and excellent auto detection of cards.
Alan has already hinted that he'd rather just dump the OSS mess (in
particular the dysfunctional GUS driver) and switch to ALSA.
Purely from a technical point of view, the ALSA drivers deliver the
best audio support under Linux. I can understand reluctance to make
the ALSA drivers the default for 2.2, but it should be considered a
definite must-have for the next development kernel series. There is
simply no need to keep the old broken OSS drivers.
