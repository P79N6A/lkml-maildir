I've looked around and couldn't find anything that returns -1 as a value
(as opposed to returning an error) when the value won't fit in 32 bits.
Here's what I've found (assuming a 32-bit app in all cases):
* sys_statfs, which fails with EOVERFLOW if any of the values won't fit
* sys_sysinfo, which scales the values down up to a PAGE_SIZE factor,
and silently truncates them if they are still too large
* BLKGETSIZE ioctl, which fails with EFBIG if the kernel itself is 32-bit,
but silently truncates if the kernel is 64-bit
* BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl, which always silently truncates
* HDIO_GETGEO ioctl (.start is ulong), which always silently truncates
I'm sure there are some other examples...
What do you think about following the example of sys_statfs in sys_shmctl?
