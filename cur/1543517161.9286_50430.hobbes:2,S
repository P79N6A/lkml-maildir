Just to confirm what you are saying:
  invariant: j <= i <= j+1          invariant:    b <= a
and this test can indeed  never be activated. But ...

 invariant: j1 <= i1 <= j1+1             invariant: j2 <= i2 <= j2+1
But that's all! You can get
               i1= 50                       i2= 100
               j1= 50                       j2= 100
               .                            b = 50
               b = 100                      .
               .                            a = 50
               .                            TEST
               a = 100                      .
which then tests with a < b on the right. I think ... (this gets
confusing).
