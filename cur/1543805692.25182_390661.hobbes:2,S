Hello Ravikiran
I like this patch, but I'm not sure current percpu_counter fits the needs.
The percpu_counter_read() can return a value that is off by +-
FBC_BATCH*NR_CPUS, ie 2*(NR_CPUS^2) or 4*(NR_CPUS^2)
if NR_CPUS = 128, the 'error' from percpu_counter_read() is +- 32768
Is it acceptable ?
Thank you
Eric
