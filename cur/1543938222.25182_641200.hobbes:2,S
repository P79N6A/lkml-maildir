Subject: [PATCH 58/58] [GFS2] Allow journal recovery on read-only mount
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/21/103

From: Abhijith Das <adas@redhat.com>
This patch allows gfs2 to perform journal recovery even if it is mounted
read-only. Strictly speaking, a read-only mount should not be writing to
the filesystem, but we do this only to perform journal recovery. A
read-only mount will fail if we don't recover the dirty journal. Also,
when gfs2 is used as a root filesystem, it will be mounted read-only
before being mounted read-write during the boot sequence. A failed
read-only mount will panic the machine during bootup.
