The linux-usb project has USB modem support underway,
with some success already reported.
home page:  www.linux-usb.org
It has some useful links on it as well, like
a USB HOWTO and a table of known "working" devices.
This is being done on 2.3.x, but there are also
patches for backporting it to 2.2.
And will be in 2.4...
