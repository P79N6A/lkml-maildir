Workqueues are kernel threads and the creator decides if they are going to
freeze.  There are only two freezable worqueues in the entire tree right now.

Actaully, I'm perfectly fine with that, as long as each task blocked by the
driver due to suspend has PF_FROZEN (or something similar) set.  Then, at
least theoretically, we'll be able to drop the freezer from the suspend code
path and move it after device_suspend() (or the hibernation-specific
equivalent) for hibernation (in that case there shouldn't be a problem with
any task waiting on I/O while the freezer is running ;-)).
