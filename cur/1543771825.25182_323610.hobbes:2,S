I had the impression the CPU vector could be shared.
But PCI 2.3 spec says:
| An MSI is by definition a non-shared interrupt that enforces data
| consistency (ensures the iterrupt service routine accesses the most
| recent data). The system guarantees that any data written by the
| device prior to sending the MSI has reached its final destination
| before the interrupt service routine accesses that data. Therefore,

| its MSI.
I guess that's pretty clear....
