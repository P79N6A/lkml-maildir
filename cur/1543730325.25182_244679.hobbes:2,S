I know it's bad form to reply to one's own posting, but I suspect that 
more information is probably useful here.
Since posting this, I've tried a single processor version of the 2.6.8.1 
kernel (even though it's a dual Opteron) and I didn't get the oops.  
I've also tried an SMP kernel without CONFIG_K8_NUMA, and the oops also 
disappears.
So the issue appears to be related to the K8_NUMA stuff, and I'll 
continue on with a non-NUMA SMP 2.6.8.1 and see if the system stays up 
and running.
Thanks,
Chris
