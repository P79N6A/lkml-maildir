They experience 90 second stalls. And please, do not tell me how fast
reiser4 is, I spent a lot of time working with it, and I know very well
when it's fast, and when it's deadly slow.

I did, after which you told me to turn OVERWRITE and MODIFY phases off,
beause performance was horrible.
I not criticizing mongo benchmark per se. I think that it is
fundamentally wrong to use results that were deliberatly manipulated to
get best appearance to reiser4 (by omitting work-loads where it performs
poorly) as an argument. It's not clear who will, according to your
colorful expression, `eat dust' as a result of this. Or do you think
that users never overwrite of modify files in real life?
