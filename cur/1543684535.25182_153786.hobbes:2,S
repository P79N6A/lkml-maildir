Have you tried using the ULOG target and the ulogd userspace daemon?
It uses netlink and can batch several entries together before it sends
them to userspace. Works a lot better than syslog.
Are you using ip_conntrack on that machine? if you are, be aware that
ip_conntrack doesn't scale well at all on SMP. It's beeing worked on.
