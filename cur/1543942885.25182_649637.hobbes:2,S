Ingo noted a few posts down the nmi_exit doesn't actually write to the APIC EOI
register, so yeah, I agree, its bogus (and I apologize, I should have checked
that more carefully).  Nevertheless, this patch consistently allowed a hangning
machine to boot through an Nmi lockup.  So I'm forced to wonder whats going on
then that this patch helps with.  perhaps its a just a very fragile timing
issue, I'll need to look more closely.

Definately not the case, I did a clean build from a cvs tree to test this and
can verify that the switch cpu patch was not in place.

As ingo mentioned this does seem to be bogus.
