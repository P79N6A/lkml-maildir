Quite. The results are interesting. For my vanilla desktop config with
all patches applied, including the fixmap.h patch for x86_64,
differences are pretty dramatic: 
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
2577982	 462352	 479920	3520254	 35b6fe	vmlinux.344.NO_OPT
2620255	 462336	 479984	3562575	 365c4f	vmlinux.442.NO_OPT
2326785	 462352	 479920	3269057	 31e1c1	vmlinux.344.OPT
2227294	 502680	 479984	3209958	 30fae6	vmlinux.442.OPT
344   : gcc 3.4.4
402   : gcc 4.0.2
NO_OPT: without -Os
OPT   : with -Os
Based on .text size alone, if I was going to build and run a kernel
with GCC 4.x, I'd definitely enable -Os.
