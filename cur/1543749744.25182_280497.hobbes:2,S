Dear Sirs,
        I have a little problem or maybe big one. I try to 
put to work the kernel-2.6.9 on my machine. I have a slackware
current install and the following hardware.
AMD Athlon 
512MB RAM
HPT 370 RAID controller 
and 2 HDD in RAID1
So when I start the kernel-ataraid-2.4.27 everything works OK.
When I start the installed kernel-2.6.9 I get the following error
message:
VFS: Cannot openroot device "7203" or unknown-block(114,3)
Please append a correct "root=" option 
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(114,3)
On my lilo.conf is root=/dev/ataraid/d0p3 
as this is the / partition. 
I tried to put the root=/dev/hde at the lilo prompt but no 
success. 
I tried many many forums but nobody was able to answer me. So 
my last sollution is you and I will very very apreciate it if 
you can give me some hints how to do it. I append you also a
dmesg from the 2.4.27 kernel. 
Many thanks in advance for your help !!!
Best Regards
Sasa Ostrouska
