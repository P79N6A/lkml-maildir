Yes, correct, this state should not escape from prepare_write, though
that's only a limitation of the current code.
Here's the corrected, corrected table:
         Mapped,  Uptodate,  Dirty:  pending write
        !Mapped,  Uptodate,  Dirty:  not possible
         Mapped, !Uptodate,  Dirty:  not possible
        !Mapped, !Uptodate,  Dirty:  not possible
         Mapped,  Uptodate, !Dirty:  regular block
        !Mapped,  Uptodate, !Dirty:  hole of zeroes
         Mapped, !Uptodate, !Dirty:  unread
        !Mapped, !Uptodate, !Dirty:  pending map
And here's the punchline: why not have 5 states instead of 3 bits and
set the state with a single function call, instead of the mutiple bit
sets we see now.
