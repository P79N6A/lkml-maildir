This can't be the right way to fix things.  try_to_release_page() may fail
whatever GFP flags you give it.  If the page *must* be invalidated at this
point then you _must_ call the invalidatepage() op, not the releasepage() op.
What is currently there allows an instikill to take place on a page at this
point, but defers the kill on pages that are busy until all the pages have
been scanned once, thus giving I/O time to happen on busy pages whilst reaping
pages that can be made immediately available.
