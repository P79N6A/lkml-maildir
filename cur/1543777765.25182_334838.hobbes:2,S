Tom,
I'm actually very much against this. Looking at a point of view from the
logdev device. Having a callback to know to continue at every buffer
switch would just be slowing down something that is expected to be very
fast. I don't see the problem with having an overwrite mode or not. Why
can't relayfs know this? It _is_ an operation of relayfs, and having it
pushed to the client would seem to make the client need to know more
about how relayfs works that it needs to.  Because, the logdev device
doesn't care about buffer switches.
