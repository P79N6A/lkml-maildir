Exactly, that one can go for sure.

In case my first note wasn't clear, I'm in favor of DEPRECIATED as a
supported feature, the mcd driver can just go away I would think. I
believe I'm using the mcdx driver in my old systems, but whatever is there
is presumably going to stay in the old kernels, and I can't imagine ever
building another kernel for a box that old. They are happily chugging
along, and when they die they will go to the 2nd hand store. If the disks
have anything requiring disposal (I think not), I will drill a few holes
in them before scrapping.
If it wouldn't be a LOT of work, I would think that using a DEPRECIATED
driver could be noted in some way in an oops, like tainted. That's just a
thought, feel free to comment, but don't expect me to defend the idea, I'm
just sharing it.
