One knows what is needed because one knows or determines what it takes
to access ones real root partition.

Except that what you have just proposed requires that you "build in
_all possible_ SCSI PCI drivers" as modules in the initramfs.  Little
gain, except that some things won't be retained.
Further, I don't thing I would expect a system with a changed SCSI PCI
controller to boot on a kernel specifically built for the previous
controller.  I don't think I would even want it to boot.  Better I
think to get out a rescue disk of some sort, boot from that,
reconfigure a built kernel for the new hardware (in the new case,
simply reconstructing the initramfs), and reboot from that.

Well, I agree that the new solution does solve some problems.
What I am worried about is not *allowing* user mode code in the
initramfs, but *requiring* it.
