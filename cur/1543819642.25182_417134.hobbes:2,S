You are correct on calling BS in that I was wrong to refer to it as the
"system root".  When a task chroots relative to it's current namespace, we
are interested in the path back to the root of that namespace, rather than
to the chroot.  I believe the patch as stands achieves this, albeit with
some changing of comments.
thanks!
