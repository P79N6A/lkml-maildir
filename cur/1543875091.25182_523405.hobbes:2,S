The array of preallocated garbage is to be killed by instantiating the
driver-private state at ->open() or at the time of file attachment or
whatever (I myself am not entirely sure of the right way to go about it).
I think someone's working on writing a patch of that form. I'm not sure
what they say is to be done about the gendisk array but I think there
are other ways to find the things by major and minor numbers.
IOW teaching loop.c to allocate more is not the way to go; one should
rather teach it to avoid doing all those allocations up-front.
