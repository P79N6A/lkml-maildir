Hi Peter,
	Yes, I was having this in mind when I wrote the load_balance_monitor() 
function - to only balance across cpus that form a disjoint cpuset in the 
system.

After reading your explanation in the other mail abt what you mean here,
I agree. Your suggestion to remove/add cfs_rq from/to the leaf_cfs_rq_list
upon dequeue_of_last_task/enqueue_of_first_task  AND

the above suggestions seems like good ideas. I can also look at reducing
the frequency at which the thread runs ..
