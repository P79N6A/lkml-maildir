Hi,
Can't access my box with 2.3.15,16  (havent tried earlier versions)
in tty login, after I type root <cr>  login appears again.
x lets me to log in, mouse jumps as he wants over the screen, no
keyboard input is accepted in terminal window (but is accepted for
keyboard movements in kde panel menu)
Truely funny story.
Actually I have nearly no way to look at it runtime, cause I cant give
nearly  any useful keyboard input to computer.
So, I guess, someone could suggest the name of the kernel module which
should be left out or taken in (I have pretty much everything in and as
much as possible compiled as modules).
I guess that some stuff doesnt like some other stuff
LetfOut/compiledAsModule/BeingIn.
dual Celeron,  Mandrake 6.0 up to date.
elmer.
