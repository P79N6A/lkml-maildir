I don't think they would ever try to.  Both filesystems would bd_claim
the blkdev, and only one would win.
The issue is more of a filesystem sharing a blockdev with the
block-special device (i.e. open("/dev/sda1"), read) isn't it?
If a filesystem wants to attach information to the blockdev pagecache
that is different to what blockdev want to attach, then I think "Yes"
- a new inode and address space is what it needs to create.
Then you get into consistency issues between the metadata and direct
blockdevice access.  Do we care about those?
