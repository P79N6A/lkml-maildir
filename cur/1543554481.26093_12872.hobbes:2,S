Hi....I was just trying to compile and load a kernel module, and I got
the following two unresolved symbols...
1. tasklet_hi_vec
2. bh_task_vec
Now, after grepping through the source I found these structures in
softirq.c. ksyms.c seems to export these symbols (doesn't appear to be
within a conditional #if)...Why isn't my kernel module able to see my
symbols?
Kernel is 2.4.0-test10....The source tree does match the running kernel
;-)
Thanks,
Joel
