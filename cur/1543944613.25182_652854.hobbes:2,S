I added some time ago patch history tracking in stgit and you can run
"stg log [--graphical] <patch>" to see all the changes for that patch
(as a list or via gitk). This is done by keeping a separate DAG of
commits linking small changes to a patch.

It shouldn't be slower than git-quiltimport (at least the recent stgit
versions) as they seem to have a similar approach (using "git apply").
There is probably an extra check stgit does for local changes before
starting the import. Otherwise, just use git-quiltimport and "stg
uncommit" to generate the patches.
StGIT approach for pushing patches is to use git-apply and, only if this
fails, switch to a three-way merge. These days it seems that the
three-way merge is pretty fast anyway, we might drop the former (after
some benchmarking).

Please try the last stable release, 0.14. The current HEAD has some
restructuring done (but gets nice features like transactions, undo).
Thanks.
