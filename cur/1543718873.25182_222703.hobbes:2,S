... but PA doesn't.  Just load-and-clear-word (and its 64-bit equivalent
in 64-bit mode).  And that word has to be 16-byte aligned.  What race
are we protecting against?  If it's like xchg() and we only need to
protect against a racing xchg() and not a reader, we can just reuse the
global array of hashed spinlocks we have for that.

Ah, atomic writes we can do.  That's easy.  I think all Linux architectures
support atomic writes to naturally aligned addresses, don't they?

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
