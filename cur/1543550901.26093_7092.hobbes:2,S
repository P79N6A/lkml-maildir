I was mulling over some other changes that would have saved another 256 bytes, 
but those don't look like they would help.  Try the patch below.  It 
essentially gives up and lets the stack occupy half of the lower page.
Also, could you look at the stack pointer at each frame, to see if you are 
encountering any stack hogs in the generic kernel?  In a different situation, 
I found devfs putting a 3K structure on the stack.
