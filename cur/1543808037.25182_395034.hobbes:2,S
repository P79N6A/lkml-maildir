Hi Paul,
You create a branch.   This will be a bit easier if you have all of the
tags for each of Linus' releases, do:
$ git fetch --tags
Then you create the branch as at the commit you're interested in:
$ git checkout -b working v2.6.16-rc2
Which tells git to create a branch named "working" as at the commit
referenced by the tag "v2.6.16-rc2".   You can see this worked
by:
$ git branch
  master
  origin
* working
Where the asterisk shows you that you're now operating in the "working"
branch.   And "git log" will show you that the HEAD commit is the
one you're interested in.
HTH,
Sean
