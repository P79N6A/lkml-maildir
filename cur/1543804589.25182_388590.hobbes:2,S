And a bonus of this is that for security and vserver-type applications,
the CLONE_NEWPID and CLONE_NEWFS will often happen at the same time.
How do you (or do you?) address naming namespaces?  This would be
necessary for transitioning into an existing namespace, performing
actions on existing namespaces (i.e. checkpoint, migrate to another
machine, enter the namespace and kill pid 521), and would just be
useful for accounting purposes, i.e. how else do you have a
"ps --all-namespaces" specify a process' namespace?
Doubt we want to add an argument to clone(), so do we just add a new
proc, sysfs, or syscall for setting a pid-namespace name?
Do we need a new syscall for transitioning into an existing namespace?
