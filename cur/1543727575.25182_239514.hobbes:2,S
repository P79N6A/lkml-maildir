Simple: you don't.
	a) filesystem may be mounted more than once in init_task's namespace
	b) filesystem may be not mounted there at all.
	c) different subtrees of filessytem might be mounted there and
full tree might be not among them; your file might be covered by some of
them.
What you are asking for is about as feasible as "I have an unlinked file.
Show me a pathname of existing link to it".  The best answer will be
along the lines of "use find(1) if you are that desperate".  And if
vfsmount/dentry did *not* give you an absolute pathname, you are in
situation equivalent to that.
No way in hell it's getting shoved in d_path() and I'm very sceptical
about any code that really needs that.
