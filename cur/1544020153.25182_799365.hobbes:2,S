At the point we are talking about software scrubbing it makes sense to assume
a least common denominator memory controller, one that does not do automatic
write-back of the corrected value, as all of the recent memory controllers
do scrubbing in hardware.
Once you handle the stupidest hardware all other cases are just software optimizations
on that, and we already have the tricky code that does a read-modify-write without
changing the contents of memory, so guarantees everything it touches will be written
back.
