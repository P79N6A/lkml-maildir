Few months ago was release by me shadow package with some neccessary
for this changes. From 
http://shadow.pld.org.pl/ChangeLog
:
2001-09-01  Tomasz Kłoczko  <kloczek@pld.org.pl>
        * src/groups.c, src/id.c, src/newgrp.c, src/useradd.c, src/usermod.c, libmisc/addgrps.c, NEWS:
        remove limit 32 to groups per user (the same user can belong to
        more than 32 groups) by use sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) instead constant
        NGROUPS_MAX (patch by Radu Constantin Rendec <radu.rendec@ines.ro>)
        NOTE: it probably need testing on other system for add some conditionals
        for using sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) or NGROUPS_MAX constant.
Some other fixes for correct displaing/handling 32bit uid/gid was after
above prepared by Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk@suse.de> and me and all was
integrated in shadow source tree. All is avalable in latest shadow 4.0.3.
