Looking into code, quite frankly I can assume that my computer would 
have to eat up 900MB of swap. Very unquite as whole thing hangs whem 
swap usage is twice memory. Simply due to slow HD, wait times are far 
too long for him to cope with it.
with swap redone (swapoff /dev/hda1 && mkswap -v1 /dev/hda1 && swapon 
/dev/hda1), still the same happends.
