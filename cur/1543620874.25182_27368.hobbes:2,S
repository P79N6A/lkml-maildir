Alan is right about the first version of the patch not getting all dirty
buffers I haven't looked at the latest version but the change seems to be
correct. Other than that I agree that "everything which was dirty at the
time it was called" is exactly right, what the user expects and what the
SuS says.
However, after thinksing about the SuS, it says (paraphrase) "queued but
not necessarily written." So if I read that right sync() is intended to be
a non-blocking operation. We can do that, but there is one thing which
must be added: with all the various patches which hack the elevator code,
we need a flag which says "do not add anything more to this pass." That
makes the SuS implementation of sync() possible, and makes the completion
of the operation deterministic. When all the dirty blocks are written the
operation is done.
