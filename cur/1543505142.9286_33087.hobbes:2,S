BTW do you know that rfc1122 prohibits advertising MSS < 536. 8)
Fragmentation is less expensive than pure TCP in such cases.

Seems, you did not understand me. Again, pmtu discovery is used
to increase packet size, rather than reduce. Turning it off
leaves us with mtu 576 (or 1280 for IPv6).
If we agreed with this, no problems exist and nothing to discuss.
Actually, if we rejected IP frames of size > 576, we also would
be right. Nobody is allowed to send them to use without our permission.
But we are not in children garden yet.
Nobody takes seriously the fact that IP is supposed to work over links
with mtu 68. We just fragment in this case.
