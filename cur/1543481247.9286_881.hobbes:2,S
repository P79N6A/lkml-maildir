If your process gets a signal, read() will return -1 and set
errno to EINTR. You must try the system call again, in a loop,
until you get it to work. This could happen because:
* Someone stops and continues the process
* There is an alarm timer event
* A child process exits
* The window size is changed
* You are running a profiler
...
You get gross code like this:
static void collect_data(int src){
  int rcount;
  int total = 0;
  for(;;){
    rcount = read(src,buf+total,AMOUNT-total-1);
    if(rcount == -1){
      if(errno == EINTR) continue;
      perror("read() failed");
      exit(1);
    }
    if(!rcount) break;  /* done */
    total += rcount;
    buf[total] = '\0';  
    if(total==AMOUNT-1)        break;  /* 64 kB is more than enough! */
    if(strstr(buf,"\r\n\r\n")) break;
    if(strstr(buf,"\n\n"))     break;  /* broken unix-like client */
    if(strstr(buf,"\r\r"))     break;  /* broken mac-like client */
  }
}

With this being the linux-kernel mailing list, the native kernel API
is of interest. Win32 and POSIX can be done in user-space, as calls
to whatever the kernel API is.
