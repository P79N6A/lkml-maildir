Hi,
Several times when I worked with Windows, I have had a scenario when I
am editing a file and saved some time ago and then the application
crashes and I lose all recent data.
Can the operating system detect all application crashes ? If so, why
can't the OS save the user data to disk before the application quits ?
How does this work in Linux. I was curious if such a functionality
already exists in Linux. If not, what are the issues involved in
implementing this functionality.
thanks
Allison
