So then what's the point of having in_atomic() at all?  Is it nothing 
more than a shorthand form of (in_irq() | in_softirq() | 
in_interrupt())?
In short, you are saying that there is _no_ reliable way to determine
am-i-called-from-inside-spinlock.  Well, why isn't there?  Would it be 
so terrible if non-preemptible kernels did adjust preempt_count on 
spin_lock/unlock?
