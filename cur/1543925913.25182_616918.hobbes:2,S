When you are touching code that I know is going to have problems on a
whole range of different manufacturer's machines, do you expect me to
just ignore that and let you add a feature that is going to be
incorrect?

Again, based on the past history with such things as mis-labeled
ethernet ports, I have doubts.  I can hope, but I need proof based on
the major problems we have had in the past.
It is better to not show information to users at all, then to give them
information that is incorrect, don't you think?

Don't mix up things like filesystems and exposing pci slots.  That is
just foolish...
