I think "character assasination" (or, more precise, harakiri)
is what you did in the email that started off this thread.
Sure, Linux development is different than development of
closed source software, but that's no reason for a bi-monthly
flamefest. Time to dig out the "don't drink and mail" sign
and permanently bury this thread. In your wise words: "get
over it".

Judging from your original post and your later apology this
would only be a good idea if we stick to drinks that are less
flammable than we ourselves are. Maybe email really isn't a
good medium to talk this out; a polite face to face meeting
may indeed be better...
kind regards,
Rik
