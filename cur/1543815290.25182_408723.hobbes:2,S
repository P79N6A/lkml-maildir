And it still is a PITA backup wise. There's nothing wrong with the stuff

He hasn't done that.

I don't think that you followed the discussion or understand the reasons
behind uswsusp. If there's a (performance-wise) sane way to put
encryption (only the data translation) into userspace without copying of
buffers and too many context switches why not? But this won't happen.

If you mean the IV schemes: as I understand it, this was mostly done to
stay compatible to cryptoloop. You are free to submit a patch that adds
another mode to dm_crypt.

As well as swsusp-encryption is concerned this should be _userspace_ and
they can reuse libopenssl or such.

I'm quite happy with dm_crypt + pam_mount. Works transparent and like a
charm. Don't know what your requirements are.
