Wait, I'm not talking about swsusp here, that's exactly my distinction
between driver state and device state :) Only system suspend like swsusp
and suspend-to-ram require a completely coherent and frozen memory
"image".
All sorts of dynamic PM, including system-wide "idle" can deal with
scenarios where the driver can stay functional and decide by itself to
wake up the device upon incoming requests.

Any block device basically, I don't even want to think about the issues
between NFS & suspend :)
That is anything that userspace potentially requires to operate (device on
the path to an mmap'd file, swap, whatever)...
