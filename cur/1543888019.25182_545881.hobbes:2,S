BTW, the lack of home-grown coversions is not a benefit - it's _nice_ to
have protections against mixing be32 and ubi32, etc.  Avoiding the mess
with struct, OTOH, *is* a benefit.
So I'd rather go with independent bitwise types and conversions done by
use of be... ones + force-cast.  The rest of ubi code remain unchanged.
