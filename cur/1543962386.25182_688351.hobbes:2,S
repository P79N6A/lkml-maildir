If I only release into my tree's for-next branch what I would release
into my tree's for-linus if I was to send a merge request to Linus right
in this moment, then I won't need advance notice of a merge window.
IOW, treat -next everyday as if the merge window was open right now.
I'm sure it is not that easy for the larger subsystems or the
infrastructure trees.  However, Linus' late -rc announcements are plenty
of advance notice, at least for a merge period as long as two weeks.
