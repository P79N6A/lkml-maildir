I'm using a Promise FastTrak 66 controller with a custom slackware 8 
bootdisk, and every time I try to boot it freezes after detecting hde, hdg, 
ide10 ide2, and ide3 (I have one drive on each port on the controller in 
RAID0 and a CD on the main IDE bus). I tried with kernel 2.4.12 and 
2.4.12-ac3, enabling both Promise FastTrak options (one for the controller, 
one for IDE RAID) and software RAID. I've done searches on google and their 
newsgroup archives and haven't found anything describing a solution to this 
problem. 
I will do my best to provide any additional information that could help if 
this is a new problem, but it can be a bit slow since I can only transfer it 
by swapping the video cable and using BioLink (TM of RealLife, INC).

Then: I have discovered a truly remarkable proof which this margin is too 
small to contain.
Now: Microsoft has released an unremarkable product which your hard drive is 
too small to contain.
