Hi.
That makes perfect sense: If you get a hang the second time, it's
generally because something loaded during the first resume didn't handle
the suspend properly, and is in a 'bad' state now. USB and DRI are the
main sources of those issues at the moment. The solution would be to
stop usb and unload the drivers prior to suspending, and reload/restart
afterwards. I do this with my USB mouse (having switched to a text
console) with no ill effects. YMMV.
Regards,
Nigel
