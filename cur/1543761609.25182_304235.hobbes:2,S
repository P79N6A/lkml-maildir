i have released the -V0.7.41-00 Real-Time Preemption patch (merged to
2.6.12-rc1), which can be downloaded from the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
the biggest change in this patch is the merge of Paul E. McKenney's
preemptable RCU code. The new RCU code is active on PREEMPT_RT. While it
is still quite experimental at this stage, it allowed the removal of
locking cruft (mainly in the networking code), so it could solve some of
the longstanding netfilter/networking deadlocks/crashes reported by a
number of people. Be careful nevertheless.
there are a couple of minor changes relative to Paul's latest
preemptable-RCU code drop:
 - made the two variants two #ifdef blocks - this is sufficient for now
   and we'll see what the best way is in the longer run.
 - moved rcu_check_callbacks() from the timer IRQ to ksoftirqd. (the
   timer IRQ still runs in hardirq context on PREEMPT_RT.)
 - changed the irq-flags method to a preempt_disable()-based method, and
   moved the lock taking outside of the critical sections. (due to locks
   potentially sleeping on PREEMPT_RT).
to create a -V0.7.41-00 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
