You don't have to rebuild _any_ applications if you go from libc5 to glibc.
Why do you think you need to do that??
The move from glibc 2.0 to glibc 2.1 is a bit more painful, unfortunately,
but that wasn't the question.
NB, of _course_ glibc is the best thing since sliced bread.
Just ask anybody who helped to actually write the thing.  ;-)
