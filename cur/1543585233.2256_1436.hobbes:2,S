I think union like this is fine.
We currently have:
ioctl(sock, COMMAND, ifreq*)
where ifreq is defined in include/linux/if.h and is 16 bytes long:
struct ifreq {
        {
                char    ifrn_name[IFNAMSIZ];    /* if name, e.g. "en0" */
        } ifr_ifrn;
        union {
                struct  sockaddr ifru_addr;
                struct  sockaddr ifru_dstaddr;
                struct  sockaddr ifru_broadaddr;
                struct  sockaddr ifru_netmask;
                struct  sockaddr ifru_hwaddr;
                short   ifru_flags;
                int     ifru_ivalue;
                int     ifru_mtu;
                struct  ifmap ifru_map;
                char    ifru_slave[IFNAMSIZ];   /* Just fits the size */
                char    ifru_newname[IFNAMSIZ];
                char *  ifru_data;
        }
I understand we can put a config structure address in ifru_data - but
do we really need another level?
Wouldn't it be better put config structs there (in the union)?
It would then read:
struct ifreq {
        {
                char    ifrn_name[IFNAMSIZ];    /* if name, e.g. "en0" */
        } ifr_ifrn;
        union {
                struct  sockaddr ifru_addr;
                struct  sockaddr ifru_dstaddr;
                struct  sockaddr ifru_broadaddr;
                struct  sockaddr ifru_netmask;
                struct  sockaddr ifru_hwaddr;
                short   ifru_flags;
                int     ifru_ivalue;
                int     ifru_mtu;
                struct  ifmap ifru_map;
                char    ifru_slave[IFNAMSIZ];   /* Just fits the size */
                char    ifru_newname[IFNAMSIZ];
                char *  ifru_data;
		struct hdlc_physical ...
		struct hdlc_bitstream
		struct hdlc_protocol
		struct fr_protocol
		struct eth_physical
		struct atm_physical
		struct dsl_physical
		struct dsl_bitstream
		struct tr_physical
		struct wireless_physical
		struct wireless_80211
		struct wireless_auth
        }
while I'd put "media_group" in ioctl command code:
#define SIOCSHDLC_PHY ...
#define SIOCGHDLC_PHY ... /* get */
#define SIOCSFR ...
#define SIOCSETH_PHY ...
#define SIOCSATM...
A possible problem is if the struct gets longer - we would have to recompile
all utils using it. Doing that before distributions start using 2.4 as
a kernel for general use would save us (we can use pointers in such cases
as well, as some operations - downloading firmware or crypto keys - may have
very long data areas).
What do you think about it?
