Ah I had a clue playing with /dev/, pty is the master tty and there can be
only 1 task attached to it. Once a pty has a taks attached, it's slave tty
(ttyp??)  become usable and there can be many task attached to the slave
tty. 
xterm attach to pty (that act as a the server for our eyes) and bash print
things on the xterm via ttypx, OK, now everything in tty_io.c looks more
understandable to me ;).
