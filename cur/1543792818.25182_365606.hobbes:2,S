Thanks for the trace.  I see what is happening.
I changed
  wait_event_timeout_interruptible 
in md.c(md_thread) to
  wait_event_timeout
as the thread no longer needs to be able to respond the signals.
However that has the side-effect of putting the process in the 'D'
state and adding to the 'uptime'.
I guess I'll put that back...
