Its one route - or we dump it into an ELF section in the binary.

Then what we really need by the sound of it is enough gcc smarts to do
something of the form
	.section "debugbits"
	.asciiz 'hook_sched'
	.dword l1	# Address to probe
	.word 1		# Argument count
	.dword gcc_magic_whatregister("next"); [ reg num or memory ]
	.dword gcc_magic_whataddress("next"); [ address if exists]
Can gcc do any of that for us today ?
