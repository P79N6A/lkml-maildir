Alright,finally had another machine to try the attached patch.  I get an 
odd error regarding IRQ 17:
"irq 17: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)"
along with a long error message (but the kernel continues to load).  
Aside from that the ports now allow me to run a getty on them and the 
DTR line lights up on my serial tester (as it does with a working port) 
but the device on the other end doesn't function.
I've updated the web page with lspci -vv and dmesg output.  I can also 
post it here if that's desirable, just figured I'd save everyone the 
inbox flooding :).
