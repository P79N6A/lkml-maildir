It's not about intelligence!  It's about the nature of human visual
pattern-matching.  Reading a pattern is always easier when you've seen
it thousands of times before.
Henry Spencer's dictum about brace style seems particularly apropos:
8.  Thou shalt make thy program's purpose and structure clear to thy
    fellow man by using the One True Brace Style, even if thou likest
    it not, for thy creativity is better used in solving problems than
    in creating beautiful new impediments to understanding.
And that's what "0 == foo" is: an impediment to understanding.
