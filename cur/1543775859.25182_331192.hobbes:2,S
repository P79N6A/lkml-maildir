I don't really have a list.  The devices that brought this issue to
my attention are a 3c905B and a 3c556B, both covered by the 3c59x
driver.
According to section 5.4.1 of the "PCI BUS POWER MANAGEMENT INTERFACE
SPECIFICATION, REV. 1.2", a device transitioning from D3hot to D0
_may_ perform an internal reset, thereby going to "D0 Uninitialized"
rather than "D0 Initialized".  Since this behaviour is ratified by
the spec, I think we need to accomodate it.
A bit in the PMCSR register indicates how a device will behave in
this regard.  We could have a test to only execute the BAR restoration
for those devices that seem to need it.  I left that out because it
seemed to add needless complexity.  In the meantime the patch has
gotten bigger and more complex, so maybe that code doesn't make it
any worse.  Do you want me to add that?

The Thinkpad T21 does this.  I don't know of any others specifically,
but it seems like something laptop BIOSes would be likely to do.

As RMK pointed-out, this code is inspired by setup-res.c; specifically
that in pci_update_resource.  I'd prefer not to blaze any new trails
regarding 64-bit BAR support ATM... :-)
So, is the current patch acceptable?  Or shall I add the check for the
"no soft reset" bit in the PMCSR register?
Thanks,
John
