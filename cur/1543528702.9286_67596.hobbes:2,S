If a programme depends on the write bit of a symlink, it's broken. In
this case, you may say it doesn't matter, but it makes me think that
the programme is probably broken in other ways. If I leave devfs as it
is, it forces someone to look at the buggy programme, which increases
the chance that it will receive a mini-audit, something it is clearly
in need of.

Why would the permissions on the symlink matter, then? The only way I
can see how symlink permissions matter is if a call is made to
lstat(2). Both stat(2) and access(2) traverse the link.

/dev/tty shouldn't matter, as that is a standard name that devfs (not
devfsd) creates. The problems lie with /dev/ttyN (moved to /dev/vc).

Yep, so many assumptions :-)
