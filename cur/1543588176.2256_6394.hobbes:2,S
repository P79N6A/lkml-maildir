There is something wonderful in this simple solution.
However I've a few doubts:
- choice policy for thread to wake is not selectable
- we separate shared memory area from file descriptor
- the implementation of down_try has neither been discussed nor

The implementation of a specific filesystem seems to me more flexyble.
