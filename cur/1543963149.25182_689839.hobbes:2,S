Hi there,
deleting large files, say on the order of 4.6GB, takes approximately forever.
Why is that?  Well, it is because a lot of things need to take place to free
the formerly used space, but my real question is "why does the unlink caller
have to wait for it?"
I.e., could unlink do the directory changes and then hand off the rest of the
task to a kernel thread?
