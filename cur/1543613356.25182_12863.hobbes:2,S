Following up to myself :--(
There was an additional patch that I had forgotten.
It might cause allocation failures (due to slower movement between lists)
 - but no such thing were indicated in the messages...
And why should it only happen when trying to mount?
(could be the patches again - some kind of version mismatch...)
Now running 2.4.17-rc1 and trying to reproduce it.
I have not succeded yet :-)
