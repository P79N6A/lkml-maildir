Full duplex.  I suppose theoretical full throughput is 2Gbps.  Sar reported 
about 1174 Mb/sec with one adapter on one of these results above, and it was 
454 Recv/720 Tx (I had the percentages incorrectly swapped in previous 
email).  This is still with an MTU of 1500!

It occurred to me later, the answer was obvious, the one you mentioned: 
clients.  I originally had enough clients to accomplish 1000 Mbps, but I'm 
pretty sure 44 client will not cut it for NetBench at around 1500 Mbps (where 
this hopefully will end up).  NetBench throttles the clients, so I really 
can't drive them much harder.  There is an option to simulate more than one 
client per computer, but I have had trouble in the past with that, but I am 
going to give it one more try.
