Something that I'd *really* love to see is usage of other bugzillas
xml-rpc interfaces, so that for eg, if someone files a Fedora bug
where some driver blows up, and I think it doesn't look like
it's caused by any patch in our tree, I'd love to click a button
in rh-bugzilla and have the bug automatically be also filed
in bugme.osdl, with the various comments mirrored back to the
originating bugzilla.
One of the problems faced by bug-reporters sometimes is that with
the multitude of bugzillas out there, and no cooperation between
them all, they don't know where to file their bug.
"My sound driver blew up, where do I file a bug"
bugzilla.redhat.com? bugme.osdl.org ? (in fact, I think the ALSA
folks have their own bugzilla if memory serves correctly)
[This demonstrates the problem -- even _I_ don't know, and I get a fair
 amount of alsa bug reports from end-users]
I've never actually looked into the xml-rpc implementation of bugzilla,
so my mental-image of how this stuff works may be grossly oversimplified,
but I've heard multiple folks claim this should be possible with some
scripting.  I've also heard people asking for the opposite.
"This bugme.osdl bug is present in RHEL/SLES/etc.. file a bug using
 xml-rpc in the various bugzillas so that it gets backported".
