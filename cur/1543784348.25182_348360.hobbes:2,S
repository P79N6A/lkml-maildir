And in many cases there is a cost difference between the Linux 
compatible unit and what's on sale with every feature you want but the 
supported wireless. And since a fair number of nice machines come with a 
single slot, adding a card is not always an option, there may be 
something else there.
If the machine which runs Linux costs anywhere near the cost of a 
Windows license, whoever pays the bills has a real incentive to turn to 
the dark side.

It appears that Linus has decided that there are not going to be any 
such from kernel.org. That's a bad thing for users, to choose between 
obsolete and stable, but it's his kernel.
I wouldn't go shouting "fork" so loud, a major fork would kill Linux as 
dead as BSD, a family of neat operating systems, none of which is widely 
used the way Linux is, and which are compatible with each other mainly 
at the acronym level, all are called BSD.
Question: does colinux get around all this crap by using the Windows 
drivers and running in essentially microkernel mode? Windows as the new 
NDISwrapper ;-)
