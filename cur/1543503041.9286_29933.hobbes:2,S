Hi Heather.

Here's a list of the 2.2.5-22 RPM's on the local sunsite mirror,
grouped for discussion...
 Q>     4548578  kernel-2.2.5-22.i386.rpm
 Q>     4464186  kernel-2.2.5-22.i586.rpm
 Q>     4463916  kernel-2.2.5-22.i686.rpm
 Q>     4315631  kernel-smp-2.2.5-22.i586.rpm
 Q>     4315438  kernel-smp-2.2.5-22.i686.rpm
You will need ONE of the above installed, whichever best fits the
system in question. One of the first three for an UP system, one of
the last two for a SMP system - just look at the i?86 field and choose
the relevant one for your system.
 Q>       31492  kernel-ibcs-2.2.5-22.i386.rpm
That one is the Binary Compatibility Subsystem, and it is usually a
good idea to have it installed. Since it's so small, I normally
install it automatically.
 Q>      854116  kernel-headers-2.2.5-22.i386.rpm
If you plan on doing ANY code development, you will probably need the
above installed. I normally install that by default for that reason.
 Q>    11888146  kernel-source-2.2.5-22.i386.rpm
That is the kernel source code for that particular kernel. You will
only need that if you plan to compile custom kernels based on it.
 Q>      787862  kernel-doc-2.2.5-22.i386.rpm
That one contains the kernel documentation. Install it if you need to
refer to the documents therein.
 Q>      192002  kernel-pcmcia-cs-2.2.5-22.i386.rpm
If you're using a laptop with a PCMCIA subsystem, you will need that
one installed as well, otherwise it can be omitted.
 Q>     2811529  kernel-BOOT-2.2.5-22.i386.rpm
This one is rarely needed - it contains the kernel as used on the
installation boot floppies, and, as per the warning therein, it should
not be used on a production system as many otherwise useful features
are disabled due to size constraints.
 > Please let me know if you need more information and TIA.
Hopefully that helps...
Best wishes from Riley.
