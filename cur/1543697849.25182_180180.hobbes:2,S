I've seen this before, and I'll bet you 5c (yeah, I'm cheap) that it's
trying to log to syslogd.
And syslogd is stopped for some reason - either a bug, a mistaken SIGSTOP,
or simply because the console has been stopped with a simple ^S.
That won't stop "su" working immediately - programs can still log to
syslogd until the logging socket buffer fills up. Which can be _damn_
frsutrating to find (I haven't seen this behaviour lately, but I remember
being perplexed like hell a long time ago).
