If killing the most likely culprits is unacceptable, how do you view
killing entirely *random* processes??

In which case, this final failsafe behaviour (in the event that the kernel
is COMPLETELY unable to allocate ANY memory) will never hit you - unless
this third line of defence fails, in which case you are pretty much SOL
with the current kernel.

In which case, this patch is unlikely to affect you - unless your memory
watchdog fails in conjunction with another process exploding. At this
point, current kernels effectively go into a killing spree and kill
entirely random processes; patched kernels start killing the
likely-looking culprits.
