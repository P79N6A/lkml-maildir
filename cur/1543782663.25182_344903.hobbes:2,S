DMI or probably IBM ssid values. Presumably IBM have somewhere they look
for this information ?
Making the driver only load on a DMI match or with an option "force=1"
which tells people to submit the DMI data would rapidly fill a table if
IBM can't answer the general question.
At the very least it should check for an ibm laptop first.
