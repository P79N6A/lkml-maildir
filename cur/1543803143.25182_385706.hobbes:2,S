Ok, That explains why it started happening for you only _now_, but not why 
it happens in the first place.
Can you test if the patch that Evgeniy sent out fixes it for you even with 
PAGEALLOC debugging enabled?
Evgeniy - That is one ugly macro, can you (or Alexey, for that matter: 
somebody who can test it) turn it into an inline function or something to 
make it half-way readable? I realize that means changing the arguments too 
(right now that horrid macro accesses "uspi" directly - uggghhh).
If somebody maintains - or is interested in doing so - UFS, please speak 
up, we don't have anybody listed in the MAINTAINERS file, and when I look 
through the history, all I see is updates due to secondary issues (ie 
somebody did generic cleanups and just happened to touch UFS as part of 
that, rather than working _directly_ on UFS issues).
