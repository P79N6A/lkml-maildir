There are two ways for a tty to become a controlling terminal:
1. First tty opened after a successful setsid() call.
2. using the TIOCSCTTY ioctl after a successful setsid() call.
Both will only suceed if the current process does not already have a
controlling terminal.
(Note that TIOCSCTTY takes an argument which means "steal the controlling
tty from another session leader, if any" which only works if the calling
process is UID0).
Therefore...

at this point, tty1 is your controlling terminal (by condition 1 above),
and

> ioctl(3, TIOCSCTTY)                     = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
fails because you already have a controlling terminal.
