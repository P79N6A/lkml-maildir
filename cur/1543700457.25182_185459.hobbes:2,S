Hi,
Stephen, I don't think it is a hardware problem, since this problem
happens on
several different machines, and it happens both on SCSI disk and
our own iSCSI like device driver. I typically use:
scsi1 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.2.36
<Adaptec aic7899 Ultra160 SCSI adapter>
aic7899: Ultra160 Wide Channel B, SCSI Id=7, 32/253 SCBs
blk: queue c1671674, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
Vendor: SEAGATE Model: ST336753LC Rev: DX03

EXT3 on 2.4.23 and 2.6.0-test11 both failed. I feel when I make the
filesystem
smaller - make the filesystem usage 70% to 80% during the test- ,
the problem happens easyer.
