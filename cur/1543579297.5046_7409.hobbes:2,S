I don't think such global filtering is right from either direction, from
those asking or giving help.  But most of us look to the powers that be as
examples.  "If they do it it's ok for me to do it."  So you can say he's
wrong for doing it, but the fault comes from example.
As to your first paragraph, it doesn't much matter to ORBS if you have your
own mail server, they blacklist netblocks and the prevailing HOWTOs don't
explain the OK list or show people what rule to use to accept OK mail
servers.
