If memory serves correctly, that was circa 2.6.10, back in these commits..

    [ACPI] If BIOS disabled the LAPIC, believe it by default.
    "lapic" is available to force enabling the LAPIC
    in the event you know more than your BIOS vendor.

    [ACPI] Don't enable LAPIC when the BIOS disabled it.
    Doing so apparently breaks every Dell on Earth.

But those changes relate to the local APIC, which 'noapic' shouldn't
have any effect on should it ?
