I've fiddled with this area before (I wrote the current BusyBox mount 
command), and after a day or so of banging on it I did eventually get it to 
work.
It turns out that statvfs.f_fsid is completely useless.  What you need to do 
is a normal stat() on each path from /proc/mounts and look at the st_dev 
member, which turns out to be unique for each mounted filesystem (including 
tmpfs and /proc and /sys).  So this lets you identify unique filesystems, and 
then detecting --bind mounts and overmounts is just a question or matching up 
the st_dev values.
The remaining question was, when there are multiple mount points statting to 
the same st_dev, which one's path should df display for that filesystem when 
you do a normal "df"?  What I did is for each unique st_dev, look at the last 
entry in /proc/mounts, find its block device string (returned by getmntent() 
as mnt_fsname), and then back up to find the first entry with both the same 
st_dev and the same block device string.  Display that one, dump the rest.  
(If it had a different block device it was an overmounted filesystem.  If it 
had the same block device but wasn't the first occurence, it was either a 
duplicate mount or a --bind mounts.)

In my case "
http://landley.net/code/toybox/download/toybox-0.0.1.tar.bz2",
 
which is at best "embryonic" but if you do "make && mv toybox df && ./df" 
that one command should work.  (It's got a loooooooong way to go, I know...)
