If we call update_wall_time_one_tick(), with a mode of ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT, 
the offset can be up to +/-512000 usec.
However, in update_wall_time_one_tick(), the offset adjustment each tick is 
limited to the range of -tickadj < x < tickadj.  On many current systems, 
tickadj is 1.  Thus, a large adjustment takes a *long* time.
While we are doing this offset change, if someone else requests another offset, 
it will totally overwrite any unapplied portion of the offset from the previous 
call:
	/* Changes by adjtime() do not take effect till next tick. */
	if (time_next_adjust != 0) {
		time_adjust = time_next_adjust;
		time_next_adjust = 0;
	}
Thus, doing an offset of +512000, immediately followed by an offset of -512000, 
will leave you with a significant negative offset.
Is this the desired behaviour?
Chris
