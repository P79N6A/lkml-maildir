If I re-programm the IRQ to something else than IRQ10, the device doesn't 
resume too. So it's not only a problem of IRQ 11.

The ipw2100 driver calls pci_disable_device in it's suspend handler. But I 
think the ipw2100 maintainers need help with suspend/resume because James 
Ketrenos can't test it on his own system.
I'll change another devices IRQ line to test if it's only an ipw2100 issue.
