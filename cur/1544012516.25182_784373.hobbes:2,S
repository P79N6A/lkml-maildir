I will apply the comments that came along these reviews in a delta patch.
Note that I still wonder about false positive with a 5 loop check. I think
I will increase it to 10. This a more reasonable.
(I remember I had false positive but I'm not sure if that was because of early_printk
used for debugging. I didn't worry about it first, because I hadn't these false positive
on my last tests, just before I send this patch.)
