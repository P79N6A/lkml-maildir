Yes, the module fat wasn´t able to find cp437 as well as the charset 
iso8859-1. ( both configured as default )
If I pass the options "-o codepage=850,iocharset=iso8859-15" to mount, 
everything works fine.
Maybe, I should have been a little bit more watchful while configuring.
But weren't it sensible to provide a mechanism, which prevent's such a silly 
configuration ?
Thanks a lot 
Micha
