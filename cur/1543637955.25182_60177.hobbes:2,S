Thanks for reaffirmation. This will be already in the upcomming 110.

The interresting parts I have moved over to ide.txt in Documentation.
The "inner workings" part was:
a) ehm, very very terse in style.
b) not quite revealing the reality.
I decided that it would be better to have no docu then misguiding docu.
In esp. the description of DSC handling was not adequate.
The "history of the human race" kind of documentation was certainly
not worth it, becouse: kernel release -> bandwidth consumption ->
energy production -> environmental pollution -> not good for this
planet and not of much value for the developer reading it. I checked the 
contents in first place ;-). I tried to preserve credentials of course.
