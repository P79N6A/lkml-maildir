;-> Aha. That would make a huge difference. I know of noone
who has actually done this level of testing. I have tried upto about 50K
flows myself in early 2.6.x and was eventually compute bound.
Really try compiling out totaly iptables/netfilter - it will make a
difference.
You may also want to try something like LC trie algorithm that Robert
and co are playing with to see if it makes a difference with this many
flows.
