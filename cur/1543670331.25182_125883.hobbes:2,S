Roger,
Just saw your response on the mailing list archive. Sorry I haven't
responded earlier but as I said below I'm not subscribed to the list.
The reason I was trying 2.4.21-pre7 is that I have been unable to get
the network card working on any kernel version if local IO-APIC is
enabled and I was hoping that the changes you had submitted for the
21pre series might help but they did not.
If you want me to try anything let me know or send me a patch (directly
please).
Sorry not to be more help.
	Mark.
