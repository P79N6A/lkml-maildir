Hi,
 I bought a fujitsu MHR2020AT hard disk for my notebook (ACER TravelMate
521TE), but when linux starts, after correctly recognizing the model and
the size (20 gigabytes), it gets stuck when trying to determine partitions
(there is just one ext2 partition at the moment!)
The controller is an ALI M1535.
Thanks a lot
 Alessandro Urpi
