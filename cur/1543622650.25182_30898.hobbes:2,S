In my opinion the main problem behind the originating note is the big difference between the mainline "linus" kernel and what 
people really need or are really using. And this might be also a problem for development. Take distribution vendor kernels: make a 
diff of your favorite distribution kernel and the vanilla one and think about it. SuSE allows a detailed look inside at 
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mantel/next/patches-2.4.18-0.tar.bz2
I think development in 2.5 should focus on including this waiting patches and come to a end and release asap. I think it's more 
important to catch up with real world needs and existing patches, than working on new developments.

For me 
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/download/patches/2.4.17/README
 does it. ;-)
