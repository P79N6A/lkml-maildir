I was examining and checking the Changelog for 2.6.15 and noticed
one commit out of the 4959 that was problematic (near line 21375):
commit 7b7abfe3dd81d659a0889f88965168f7eef8c5c6

This change has no description and no one listed as signing it off.
Was there a 1-line description for this commit and was this
commit sign off by anyone?
Do either, the missing "signoff", or "description", constitute the
possibility that the "commit" went in "unapproved" & "unaudited"?
On a less worrisome note, 62 of the 4958 commits had no "details"
beyond (after) the 1-line description. Is it safe to say that further
"details" after the 1-line description are optional?
This is the first Changelog I've examined in this detail, so I can't
say if this is a first or one-time problem.
Thanks,
