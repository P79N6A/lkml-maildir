OK, but if you're running a kernel that doesn't understand this hack, how
do you give a process only the ability to listen on low ports?  In the
absence of the 'cap flag'=setuid 0, old inheritance behavior will still
apply; with this hack and a non-setuid binary, the permitted and
inheritable parts can still be used. (ref my ideas in 'caps in elf next
(final?)  itteration')

Eh, it would just fall back on the crummy older behavior.  Without 'setuid
0' it would have _no_ privs, with it set it would get all...

Well, sure, that's a bit ugly; I just feel that the benefits outweigh the
drawbacks.
