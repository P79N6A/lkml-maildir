I'd be especially impressed if you can get it to also analyse the context in
which the semaphore is used and determine whether or not it should be a
counting semaphore, a mutex or a completion. You can probably do this sort of
thing with Perl regexes... they seem to be terrifically[*] powerful.
 [*] and I mean that in the proper sense:-)
