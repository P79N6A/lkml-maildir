well for performance it's usually best to just have the native machine 
word size (i.e. long), unless there's some compelling data-structure 
size argument. In any case it's not uncommon to use 'long' for such 
types, even though some other aspect of the kernel limits it to less 
than 64 (or even 32) bits.
