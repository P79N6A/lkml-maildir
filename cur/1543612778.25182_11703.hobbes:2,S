I have a Venturis (same board as the PPro celebris, just no sockets and
such for the dual that the celebris offered).  There are odd problems
with this system.  However, if you aren't running certain features, any
recent kernel WILL run.

Even if you can get this system to boot (again PPro Venturis) w/ APM...
don't do it.  It crashes whenever any APM feature is called.

I am running with those enabled and everything works fine.  Again, mine
is a little newer than his pentium models.

Anyway, just some data points.  I believe my system is officially
Venturis GL 6200.
