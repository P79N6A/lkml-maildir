Looks like clusters of pages to me, but should be as good as readaround,
if readaround means read-behind-and-ahead in one chunk. It is also
probably simpler to implement.

I donnot follow you here. I understand that we read 64 K at a time, and
not that we queue an IO ahead, so we should still have the latency of the
data going from the disk-cache (hopefully) to memory. But as you know
modern disks have large cache, perform large prefetching, and buses are
very fast. In such a situation, queuing IO ahead is not as interesting as
it used to be in the past. 
By the way, I do think that clustering or read-around was the right thing  
to implement for page IO.
