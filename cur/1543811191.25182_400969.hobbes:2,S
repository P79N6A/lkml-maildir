I actually disagree with that, for three reasons.  Firstly, my namespace
didn't leak: I only appended these names to clear prefixes.  Secondly,
uint is already typedefed in types.h.  Thirdly, the short names are
clear and intuitive.

That was poor, yes, but typedefs would have been less polluting than
#defines.
Hope that clarifies!
