It makes life a lot simpler for those who compile with -Wundef, which is why
I did a bunch of cleanup back around 2.5.6mumble or so.  It also found a real
bug where '#if A | B | C'  and there was a typo in B.  There's also a few
places where code used '#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > NNNN' without
doing a #include of version.h - fortunately for us, all the cases of *that* happened
to do the right thing when using the implied zero.
