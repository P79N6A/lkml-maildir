within the last 3 weeks, this script went from *really usable* to *a big noise 
maker*.
I am testing this with new drivers (igb, e1000e, ixgbe) and the amount of 
warnings it throws was in the order of 10 last week, but now I'm at hundreds 
again, and my code has not changed.
The superfluous braces error should definately be fixed.
Warning on multiple declarations on a line is nice, but IMO really too verbose 
(why is "int i, j;" bad? Did C somehow change syntax today?).
Some of the new features are plain broken as I posted before. A lot of it now is 
purely false positives only.
Bottom line: I really wish that I could have the script run in the old behaviour 
before. While this level of verbosity is great for single-line patches, it 
really completely wastes my time when I'm trying to get a grasp for a 200k hunk 
piece of code.
The best way to implement this is that I can somehow select / omit some of these 
checks when running the script. With more and more checks added to the script it 
will be very quick for new driver writers to stop using it because of the sheer 
volume that the script currently outputs.
