Sorry Russell,
I had no idea who in the group had originally made the change since
yourself and Vince were accepting the kernel patches. I thought it would
be better to submit it signed rather than unsigned. 
Please let me know who is responsible and if it's ok, I'll then
re-submit.
Best Regards
Liam
