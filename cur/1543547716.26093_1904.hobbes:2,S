    I also think it's a logical conclusion that a patch to a GPL'd
    program is released under the GPL - even if you don't
    specifically say so.
I don't think this necessarily work this way; what about where you
have a dual-license? A patch to a fragment of code might be identical
for both code-bases where the license differs.
