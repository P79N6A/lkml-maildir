gettimeofday() is known to be called very often (after any select() or
poll() returns), and is optimized for such conditions. There was even
an implementation, which I don't know if it finally became mainstream,
which optimized this particular system call. Some networking applications
might call it tens of thousands of times per second.
But as Alan said, time() (not to be confused with gettimeofday()) is
not a hot path.
