Yes, I would add "board_idx" member to struct tulip_private, and 
initialize it early in tulip_init_one()
Take care to update the printk's of only those functions which are 
actually called from tulip_init_one() before register_netdev().  All 
other references are correctly using dev->name.  "tulip%d" is only 
needed at startup.
