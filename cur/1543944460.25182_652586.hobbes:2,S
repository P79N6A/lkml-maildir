Well if the VM wants to invalidate a page then the remote end first has to 
remove its mapping. 
If a page has been removed then the remote end would encounter a fault and 
then would have to wait for the local end to reestablish its mapping 
before proceeding.
So the packet would only be generated when both ends are in sync.
