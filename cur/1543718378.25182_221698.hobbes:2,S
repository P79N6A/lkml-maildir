This is not easy. kbuild uses a number of measures to check dependencies:
1) Changes in commandline, including name of binary
- Order is not relevant, only content
2) Compiler version used for version.h
- To avoid this remove the FORCE in init/Makefile
3) Usual dependencies, including stdarg.h which is part of the compiler
   include files
4) Change in configuration relevant for that specific file
I think you are hit by 1) in your case.
Do you use same name for both gcc versions?
Otherwise it will fail as you describe (actually work as expected).
Try to compare to commandlines when using "make V=1", to check what gcc
kbuild uses.
