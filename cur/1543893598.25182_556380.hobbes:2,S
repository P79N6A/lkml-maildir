As long as we don't crash the drive or AHCI controller because we hotplugged
it in a way it didn't like (like trying to hotplug a ICH5R would cause).
It is not like 1Hz would not be fast enough for laptop bays and docks, so
the polling frequency would not be a problem.  I still prefer when levels
and on/off are kept separate, but if it won't stand in the way of hotplug, I
certainly don't care enough to bother.
