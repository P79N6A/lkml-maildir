John Partridge found an interesting bug involving mthca (Mellanox
InfiniBand HCA driver) on IA64/Altix systems.  Basically, during
initialization, mthca does:
    - do some config writes, including enabling BARs
    - then start a firmware command
      - read an MMIO register from a BAR (to check if FW is busy)
However, John found that the Altix PCI-X bridge was allowing the MMIO
read to start before the config write was done (which is allowed by
the PCI spec).  The PCI trace looked like:
23454:    Config Write     REG = 01 TYPE = 1    BE = 0000  Req = (0,0,0)  Tag = 1  Bus = 1 Device = 0 Function = 0     WAIT = 2
23462:    Memory Rd DW     A = 00280698  BE = 0000  Req = (0,0,0)  Tag = 0      WAIT = 2
23470:    Split compl.     Lower A = 00  Req = (0,0,0)  Tag = 0  Comp = (0,2,0)     WAIT = 1   (Error completion)
23476:    Split compl.     Lower A = 00  Req = (0,0,0)  Tag = 1  Comp = (0,2,0)     WAIT = 1   (Normal completion of WRITE)
and that "Error completion" leads to a crash.
John proposed the following patch to fix this, which looks good to
me.  However, I have a couple of questions about this situation:
 1) Is this something that should be fixed in the driver?  The PCI
    spec allows MMIO cycles to start before an earlier config cycle
    completed, but do we want to expose this fact to drivers?  Would
    it be better for ia64 to use some sort of barrier to make sure
    pci_write_config_xxx() is strongly ordered with MMIO?
 2) Is this issue lurking in other drivers?
Thanks,
  Roland

    IB/mthca: Make sure all PCI config writes reach device before doing MMIO
    
    During initialization, mthca writes some PCI config space registers
    and then does an MMIO read from one of the BARs it just enabled.  This
    MMIO read sometimes failed and caused a crash on SGI Altix machines,
    because the PCI-X host bridge (legitimately, according to the PCI
    spec) allowed the MMIO read to start before the config write completed.
    
    To fix this, add a config read after all config writes to make sure
    they are all done before starting the MMIO read.
