..... sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
....
Some HUGE egos out here.  I guess I'd better learn to duck.  I think in
about 4 days everyones attitudes will change ..... we're having a
NetWare to Linux/Windows NT/2000 Conversion contest ... Here's the
prizes we are giving away for NetWare servers converted based on sales
of Linux FS and Windows NT 2000 servers converted.  It is being
announced in two weeks (the State of Utah has approved it).  Here's the
rules and prizes.  Everyone in Linux kernel can participate, as can your
customers and the customers of your companies.  
Any by the way, we don't need your money for investment.  Unlike most of
the Linux companies, TRG actually makes PROFIT because we are SMART
enough to sell Windows NT/2000 software (which makes money, unlike Linux
where only hardware vendors and vertical app writers can make money).
The rules are simple:
We sell Windows NT/2000 NetMigrate software for     199.99/copy
Linux 2.0/2.2/2.3/2.4 binaries we sell for           49.99/copy (they
are also free in Linux but for the contest, you must buy a license to be
counted, and provide a NetWare server serial number to provde you
converted it to Linux or Windows NT/2000).   
We are putting up a NetWare Conversion thermometer on out website
recording NetWare servers killed and converted to Linux or Windows
NT/2000.  I have secured @ $150,000,000.00 (you can guess who's putting
this up, but it's not a Linux company -- they could not afford it) in an
escrow account to pay out for the prizes. For each licensed copy
purchaed (you must also provide a NetWare server serial number proving
you've killed a NetWare server.)  There are 9,000,000 registered NetWare
servers and about 60,000,000 pirated ones (you can convert these as well
-- they are mostly in the far east and the former soviet block
countries).  
Everytime one of the numbers below is reached for converted NetWare
servers that are either converted to Windows NT/2000 or Linux, we pay
out prizes to the lucky person who hits the number.
Prizes awarded at 25,000, 50,000, and 100,000 marks will be paid out on
a rotating (modulo) basis.  
Number of Killed NetWare Servers gets the prize when the count on our
website hits these numbers

We have already pre-announced this program, and it will appear in Client
Server News Friday.  We will be sending out the press release in two
weeks.  I will get the 2.2 code drop to Alan as soon as it's finished.  
The analysts say that Linux WILL take 17% of the NetWare installed base
(about 2 million nodes).  It's almost time to go and get them.  
Enjoy,
Jeff
