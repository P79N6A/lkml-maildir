 Here are some more answers.
 1. I tried powering the machine off, unplugging it for several seconds
and then booting into Linux. Two out of three times it came into state B and
one time into state A. Thus, I think that the problem is not caused by
Win2k drivers. Moreover, rebooting into Win2k, playing something with Winamp
( 44k/16/stereo ) and returning into Linux also brought it into state A.
 2. Unloading/reloading driver module does _not_ trigger the problem.
It simply does not affect the condition. I can switch it from state
B to state A by removing i810_audio, inserting ALSA driver for the
chip, immediately removing it and inserting i810_audio back.
 3. Multiple rebooting sometimes ( not always ) switches it from B to
A, but I'm not sure that it can switch it in other direction.
 The whole thing sounds to my mind as having some kind of resource,
register, etc. which is supposed to be initialized during loading of
drivers, but it's not done by i810_audio driver.
