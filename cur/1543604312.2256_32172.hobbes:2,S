This is very explicit indeed.
In short I guess what happens is that the reader may have old data in
its cache, and the rmb() makes sure the cache used after the rmb() is
not older than the cache used before the rmb().
However the more I think about it the more I suspect we'd better use
rmb() in all readers in the common code, rather than defining rmbdd with
IPI on alpha, maybe alpha after all isn't the only one that needs the
rmb() but it's the only one defining the behaviour in detail? I can very
well imagine other archs also not invalidating all caches of all other
cpus after a write followed by wmb, the synchronization can be delayed
safely if the other cpus are readers, and they didn't issued an explicit
rmb. So what alpha is doing can really be seen as a "feature" that
allows to delay synchronization of caches after writes and wmb, unless
an explicit order is requested by the reader via rmb (or better mb on alpha).
The fact is that if there's old data in cache, a data dependency isn't
different than non data dependency if the cpu caches aren't synchronized
or invalidated during wmb run by the producer.
