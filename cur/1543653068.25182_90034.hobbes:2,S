    Unfortunately, I respectfully disagree with Andries.
:-)
    Until drivers/pci/pci.ids list is removed from the kernel source,
    I think we are best served by modelling EISA on PCI as much as
    is reasonable.
That I do not have a strong opinion about, not having much
experience with collecting PCI IDs. (I send them to Vojtech :-))
But really, Jeff, these EISA IDs are a pile of junk.
So many with the same ID describe different hardware.
I like a certain level of quality in the kernel source.
When the kernel prints something it should not be random junk.
"Never mind what the Linux kernel says - that is all just nonsense".
A user space utility with a long list is fine: 70% chance that
it is right, 30% that it is wrong. A user space utility can
print: "with that ID we have seen the following five hardware
descriptions".
Since the kernel does not use these values - they are for
informational purposes only - I would prefer to avoid the
misinformation.

[In the eisa list we see that ISAAB01 is a "HAYES Smartmodem 1200B".
My ISAAB01 however is a "Hayes Smartmodem 2400B". What do you print?]
