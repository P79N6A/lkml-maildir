qgit is a very fast git GUI viewer with a lot of features .
The biggest new feature this time is *code range filtering*
Select a file and  open the file/annotation viewer, then wait for
annotation finished and then select a history revision just to be sure
annotation info is displayed.
You will see the new 'filter' button (in annotation window tool
bar, not in main view tool bar) enabled. Press it and the file history
will be shrinked to show only revisions that modified the selected lines.
Selected code region is also highlighted for better browsing.
Filter button is a toggle button, so just press again it to release the filter.
NOTE NOTE: Range filtering it's  _slippery_   code, there are a lot of
subtle details involved, so may be something it's still missing/bogous,
qgit-1.2rc1 it's here to let properly test before final release.
