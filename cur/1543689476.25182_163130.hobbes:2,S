Oh. I see. Yes - it's accessing "vm_flags" with "MAP_SEM". That's really 
wrong, since it's not even the same _domain_. 
"vm_flags" should use the "VM_xxxx" bits. Trying to use "PROT_xxx" bits is 
totally improper, but it so happens that the low three bits 
(READ|WRITE|EXEC) are supposed to be the same.
Good catch.
It really should do what mmap() does, and translate from the "PROT_xxx" 
domain to the "VM_xxx" domain:
	flag = _trans(prot, PROT_READ, VM_READ) |
		_trans(prot, PROT_WRITE, VM_WRITE) |
		_trans(prot, PROT_EXEC, VM_EXEC);
and the only reason sys_mprotect _looks_ like it is working is that those 
three bits (but _not_ MAP_SEM) happen to be the same anyway.
I'm inclined to be lazy, and say "we know the low three bits of "prot" and 
"flags" are the same, and leave it as-is, but remove the MAP_SEM, which 
clearly is a bug.
But the proper thing is to move that part of calc_vm_flags() to a header 
file. Does anybody want to take that on?
