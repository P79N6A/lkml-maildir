You can't kill it without ruining performance on older HT CPUs.
I would just keep it, it fixes the problem perhaps with a small amount of 
code. A more generalized #ifdef may be a good idea (NEED_STACK_RANDOM)
may be a good idea, but it is not really a pressing need. Enabling 
it unconditionally may be an option, although it will make it harder
to repeat test runs on non hyperthreaded CPUs.
