Ah, that's the point. We can't mix and match on these. Either all 
functions that are traced do the stack trace, or none do. This is where 
the new api may be confusing.  We can register a function to be traced via 
the function pointer, and we can pick which functions to trace, but we can 
not separate out different functions for different traces.
