The problem is that very rarely is there a second free() with no intervening
use - what actually *happens* usually is:
1) You alloc the memory
2) You use the memory
3) You take a reference on the memory, so you know where it is.
4) You free the memory
5) You use the memory via the reference you took in (3)
6) You free it again - at which point you finally know for sure that
everything in step 5 was doing a fandango on core....
