He already got it - it went in with 2.4.10pre5 on the 7.th, so
the world will be okay again when 2.4.10 comes out  :-)
There were some subtle changes between 2.4.7 and 2.4.8 which made this
problem surface, and I wasn't able to reproduce it here (I've been
using 2.4.8 and 2.4.9 (unpatched) without problems with two qnx4
partitions mounted at boot time).
