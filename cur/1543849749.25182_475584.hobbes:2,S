Yes.  Well, a single fd and ioctl()s do that as well.

I don't really see the need.  The cell dsps are a shared resource, while 
virtual machines are just another execution mode of an existing resource 
- the main cpu, which has a sharing mechanism (the scheduler and 
priorities).

I've thought of it but it can't work on i386 because guest physical 
address space is larger than virtual address space on i386.  So we 
mmap("/dev/kvm") with file offsets corresponding to guest physical 
addresses.
I still like that idea, since it allows using hugetlbfs and allowing 
swapping.  Perhaps we'll just accept the limitation that guests on i386 
are limited.

Okay.

Yes, we're doing a sort of vmx86_64().
Thanks for the ideas, I'm certainly leaning towards a filesystem based 
approach and I'll also reconsider the mapping (mmap() vi virtual address 
space subsection).
