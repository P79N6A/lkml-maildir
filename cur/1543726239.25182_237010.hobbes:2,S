So if you try to configure the MTU to 1504 using ifconfig or whatever,
will that actually work?
One reason I ask is that I saw a report of a bug/issue where it was
not possible to send a raw-packet from user space that is bigger than
the MTU.  This would preclude user-space from generating a VLAN packet
with the extra 4 bytes.  Being able to change the MTU would at least
partially work around this issue.
