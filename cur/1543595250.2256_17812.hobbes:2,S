The benchmark that used lmbench that was posted tested fork follwed fork
by exit not follwed by exec.
Although you could have used vfork in that test, the point of the test
was to get some feel for how much overhead the fork and exit together
had. A real application could not use vfork, because it would do some
actual work before the exit.

Most forking servers I know of don't exec programs to deal with accepted
connections. (The only exception I can think of is inetd and its
cousins, the performance of which is not important.)

vfork is not portable. There are standards that specify what it does,
but the portable semantics are so useless that if you use it you will
almost certainly wind up with undefined behavior.
However, the original discussion was about threads. How to do fork+exec
(or vfork+exec if you insist on using that broken interface) quickly is
beside the point.

You appear to be saying that spawning child programs is an example of
threading. I don't think that's what most people mean by threading.
