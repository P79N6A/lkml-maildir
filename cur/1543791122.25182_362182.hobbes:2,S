Subject: 2.6.14 shutdown crash on smp (Badness in send_IPI_mask_bitmask)

I just moved from 2.6.10 to 2.6.14 (both self-compiled from
kernel.org sources)
Machine is smp (Asus VP6 mobo 2 x 1ghz PIII)
In my .config :
CONFIG_PM is not set
CONFIG_ACPI is not set
ACPI is switched off in the bios
In previous kernels I had crashes on  shutdown until I put
append="acpi=off"
On "shudtdown -h now" (never on "shutdown -r now") I am
crashing with :
Badness in send_IPI_mask_bitmask at
arch/i386/kernel/smp.c:167
Seems to be the same as problem reported on 10th September
by Frank van Maarseve for 2.6.14 :
2.6.13: Badness in send_IPI_mask_bitmask at arch/i386 
Andrew Morton followed up, but I am not sure what the
outcome was.
I will happily supply any further information do tests.
I am not subscribed to the list .. please cc me with any
replies.
