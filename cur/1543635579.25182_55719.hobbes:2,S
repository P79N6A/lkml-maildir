vmstat.c:
hz = sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);	/* get ticks/s from system */
And yes I know the libproc is *evil* in this area.
The rest should be an implementation detail of sysconf().
Changing this value during the runtime of vmstat is interresting story
anyway, but it should be up to the sysadmin to do this kind
of stuff only at runtlevel 1.
sysconf can be indeed imeplemented as a single global
file containing configuration data. But sysctl is another story
of course.
