Just an interesting off-topic word about Internet filters -- I
experimented with BESS (aka N2H2) and found out that they filter based on
at least three criteria:  (1) URL, (2) Ports, and (3) CGI parameters.
This means that they don't censor wordpatterns or anything like that.  I
found that to be quite interesting.
