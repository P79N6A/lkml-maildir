As one example, the MicroBlaze soft-core processor family designed  
for use on Xilinx FPGAs will (by default) simply forcibly zero the  
lower bits of the unaligned address, such that the following code  
will fail mysteriously:
const char foo[] = { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07 };
printf("0x%08lx 0x%08lx 0x%08lx 0x%08lx\n",
		*((u32 *)(foo+0)),
		*((u32 *)(foo+1)),
		*((u32 *)(foo+2)),
		*((u32 *)(foo+3)));
Instead of outputting:
0x00010203 0x01020304 0x02030405 0x03040506
It will output:
0x00010203 0x00010203 0x00010203 0x00010203
Other embedded architectures have very similar problems.  Some may  
provide an "unaligned data access" exception, but offer insufficient  
information to repair the damage and resume execution.
