... and there's no such un assumption anywere. Even the example does not
assume that: it happens to show that, because it's scope was to show
another thing... but now I see the misunderstanding. B-)

Exacly. So there's no relationship.
Different applications shows different behaviours. It's just that
(given a certain application, then you can see relationships between
switch rate / run queue and so...; that's an application property, not
a general one).

Never said that. The single-threaded server example just demonstrated that
you can have high loads without long RQ. Just that.

Ok. Now it's clear.  I was in a more general case.

That was not clear in my orginal article. At that point i was really
talking in the more general case.

Good point. I'm not able to give you any. I have no figures.
I think (quite a wild guess) that a loaded NFS server will show that.
But I don't have access to such a system.
BTW, I was wrong. High switch rate is not really "desiderable". Every
application should keep it low. But sometimes you tradeoff for low-latency,
for example. So even if it's not "desiderable", it may give you something
(low-latency) that you want, at the price of not being optimal (from a
scheduler point of view).
So I imagine that well written applications, which generate quite a lot
of switches exist.
But I can't think of what you may want a long RQ for. A long RQ gives you
nothing.

I hope someone else will fill the gap with numbers... I can't.

Yes. To get it *loaded*, you need tens of (absurdly) loaded clients and
a fast eth connection. Or 100 quite loaded clients. So, unless you're
running some kind of benchmark, you've got 100 of humans that repeatedly
hit 'Refresh' on their browers. Reading just static pages (you see,
non static pages defeat the cache argument a bit). How a "real" case...
And if you have 10000+ real clients, well you can afford a second PC, i
think.

Again, you assume many, fast, static requests. It's possible. Not very

You mean N? 1 is the RQ/NCPU ratio...

So tune the server, not the scheduler.

...  even without changing the whole server framework, you may optimize it.
And this probably ends up in shortening the RQ anyway. And if you can't
optimize further, and the RQ is still long, you've probably reached an
HW limit. Or you're doing something for which you need better kernel
support (Async IO?). Either case, why change the scheduler?

So why bothering of patching the scheduler? Better keep a clean design.
You're saying: "I don't really care of pref, so I write my application
in Java, not in C. But since I care of perf, you kernel guys change the
scheduler to better support my sub-optimal design..."
If performance is not a concern, for you, use the standard kernel.
If you're concerned about performance, write a better application, or
a better Java implementation, or a better language that allows a fast
implementation.
And BTW, I doubt Java *forces* you in writing applications with 1000+
threads.

If you assume that, in general, all well written application do not
switch a lot, what's the purpose of an optimized scheduler, in the
very beginning?
Well, let's move it to the new thread. But we agree on many things, and
I can't answer to all of your questions. See my previous message on your
thread.
