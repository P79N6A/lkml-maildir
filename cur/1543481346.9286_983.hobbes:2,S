Hello, my Gnulix friends!
The modest and self-effacing MEEPT has a few questions:
Will Gnulix 2.2 play my DVD pr0n?
Will Gnulix 2.2 work with cutting jagged slicing hacking slashing 
bleeding mutilating edge devices like, say, my USB keyboard?
Has GGI been intergated into the Gnulix 2.2 colonel yet?
MEEPT!!!
