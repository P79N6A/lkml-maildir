I beat off a suggestion last week[1] that the kernel should `not bother
with any of this /proc and /sys stuff' but just export a single vast
heap of XML, because XML is `properly structured'.
(As opposed to, oh, a filesystem, which is apparently not structured
enough.)
Considerations of ugliness and difficulty of implementing the equivalent
of writes to procs files did not shift the twit: but starting top on a
busy system and showing said twit the CPU load spikes as /proc/[0-9]*
got iterated over, and asking `how severe would this be if *all* of
/proc and /sys had to be generated for every single request?' seems to
have imparted enough clue.
I have a large notice by my desk at work reading simply `XML is not a
panacea'. It's amazing how few people wandering by read it.
