Subject: [patch] suspend: fix suspend on single-CPU systems
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Clark Williams reported that suspend doesnt work on his laptop on 
2.6.20-rc1-rt kernels. The bug was introduced by the following cleanup 
commit:
 commit 112cecb2cc0e7341db92281ba04b26c41bb8146d
 Author: Siddha, Suresh B <suresh.b.siddha@intel.com>

    [PATCH] suspend: don't change cpus_allowed for task initiating the suspend
because with this change 'error' is not initialized to 0 anymore, if 
there are no other online CPUs. (i.e. if the system is single-CPU).
the fix is the initialize it to 0. The really weird thing is that my 
version of gcc does not warn about this non-initialized variable 
situation ...
(also fix the kernel printk in the error branch, it was missing a
 newline)
