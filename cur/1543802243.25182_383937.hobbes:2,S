I guess I should mention that it's slightly different this time.
Last time the mouse would stall every 5 seconds regardless of it being
in motion or not. This time around the mouse doesn't stall if I keep
moving it. Only when I leave it still for ~10 seconds or more does it
stall when I then try to move it again. It stalls for something like 1
or 2 seconds, then moves fine until left alone for >= 10 sec again.
