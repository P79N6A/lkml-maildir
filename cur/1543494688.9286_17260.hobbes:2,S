I knew I would have to put on the fireproof undies for that one :)
My actual meaning of "failure" is that of Ken Thompson's meaning of "not
successful": Plan9 is not and will not be a commercial success. It's not
marketed and little used in the business sector. At any rate, it never
took off like it was hoped.
Technically, I understand Plan 9 is a very elegant and well done design...
