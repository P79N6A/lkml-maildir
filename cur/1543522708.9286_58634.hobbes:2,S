That in the face of files that appear and dissapear, directories that get
renamed, stuff that is being moved from one file into another, etc. The
only reasonable way to to that that I can see right now is to configure the
new kernel with all needed options (there might be new options, or options
that where split up) and pick the files that would compile and
#include. Note that there is rather widespread disatissfaction with the
current configuration system, as it is brittle and buggy.
IMHO, your proposal is just too much hard work to do for much too little
gain.
