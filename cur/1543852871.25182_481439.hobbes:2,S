Christoph,
It is documented and has been from day one. See scsi/sg.h
and 
http://sg.torque.net/sg/p/sg_v3_ho.html
Naming it is a challenge and at the time there
were no bidirectional transfers to/from a device
to worry about.
A more appropriate but impractical name might be:
SG_DXFER_TO_KERNEL_BUFFER_THEN_READ_FROM_DEV_VIA_KERNEL_BUFFER
