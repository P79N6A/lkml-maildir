Yes!!!!!!  It works.  Details follow in the steps below.

(Did all of those steps explicitly from cold boots.)

Yes!  Works fine both ways.  No error messages, no funny behavior.

Worked fine...

Did NOT work.  Error message:
/lib/modules/2.2.10/net/plip.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
That *is* where I have my modules.
Here's the output from lsmod:

This did not work!  Here's the output from stderr:
plip0: unknown interface: No such device
SIOCSIFMTU: No such device
SIOCSIFADDR: No such device
plip0: unknown interface: No such device
SIOCSIFDSTADDR: No such device
plip0: unknown interface: No such device
plip0: unknown interface: No such device
SIOCADDRT: No such device
Here's another piece of info for you.
Before bringing this to the mail list, I tried compiling plip directly
into the kernel.  At first it wouldn't compile until I added some other
feature, one which I cannot recall.  On the successful compile, I
brought up the system, tried to bring up plip, and received similar
error messages as for this step.

No.  Plip does not even activate on julia.

Thank you for taking *your* time on this.  Believe me, I appreciate
this.  I hope this is helpful.
