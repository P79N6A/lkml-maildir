  are there known problems with trying to access IDE CD/RWs directly
through the IDE drivers, rather than using SCSI emulation?  i've tried
testing cdrecord using the "dev=ATAPI:x,y,z" option, and am having
no luck.
  would this be the right forum to supply details?
rday
p.s.  using 2.6.0-test1 kernel.
