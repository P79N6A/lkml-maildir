I think the point is that the rc releases make all the difference.  Linus
is deciding what kernel to base the first rc against.  So:
2.6.9-rc1 has to be based on something, either 2.6.8 or 2.6.8.1 in this 
case.  
Whatever 2.6.9-rc1 is based on is what 2.6.9 will need to be based on
(I think).
And since, certainly, 2.6.8.2 may come out *after* 2.6.9-rc1, but *before*
2.6.9 final, it seems that 2.6.9-rc1 must be based on 2.6.8 to
prevent some weird 'shifting sands' type issues where no-one would know
what kernel to base their rc and final against.
My 2cents.
David
