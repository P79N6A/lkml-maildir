I would do the browsing as one part and the smb file access as another.
That could allow a user to choose browsing implementation and file access
implementation independently. On the network level they have "nothing" in
common.
For info on user-space filesystems you should spend some more time with
google. There are people out there that have done that.
The browsing can be done as an add-on to autofs (in some form) or as a
userspace filesystem of its own.
Currently autofs has a problem where it won't show the mountpoints of
non-mounted directories, but I think you would run into that problem too.
(short version of the problem: how do you prevent 'ls -l' from mounting
 all filesystems in a directory?)
