I have done some work on Linux loading Linux...
I have written a kernel module that loads and starts a new Linux
kernel on Linux.  The code it completely contained in a module so no
kernel modifications are required at all.  The code I have is
built/tested against Linux 2.2.x but I think it should be pretty
portable to other kernel versions since it doesn't need much more than
get_free_page() from the existing kernel. I have tested this code on
the machines at my disposal and it seems to work fine.
Quick list of features:
 * It's a kernel module - no kernel patches
 * Loads initial ram disks along with the kernel image.
 * Loads kernel command lines.
This stuff starts a new kernel by returning to real mode first.  The
code and more documentation (including technical) is available at:
http://www.scyld.com/software/monte.html
(I call it two kernel monte after the game three card monte.  Two is
easier than three.  It's best to start easy.)
A limitation right now is that it doesn't handle reboots of SMP boxes.
That seems pretty hairy.  Any comments on the code and/or suggestions
about what to do with SMP would be greatly appreciated.
