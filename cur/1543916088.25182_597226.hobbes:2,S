Yes :)
My suggestions is:
 - mknod for unprivilegued user is allowed in the following case
    (1) mount point is mounted with MNT_NODEV
    (2) mount point is owner by the user doing mknod
 - and maybe
    (3) we have a special mount option to allow it if we don't want
        to allow it for normal unprivilegued mounts for some reason
which implies we need to get in unprivilegued mounts first, but we'll
have to do that anyway.
