Hi all!
(Please Cc)
I alsohave to report a very similar incident. Debian/sid, kernel 2.6.22.
Doing some hard work for the disk (svn up of two big repositories, some
copying of files, etc etc).
Suddently the PC froze. Nothing, I had to reboot. But then:
- BIOS didn't detect the disks, or better, it took extremely long
- booting into linux gave those time out messages already mentioned (I
  am away, cannot give you details for now till sunday)
- booting into windows frooze windows when accessing the second harddisk
  (from which stuff was copied).
- reseting the computer didn't help., but turning physically off, and
  turning on again did the trick, some fsck-ing.
- booting into windows needed chkdsk from ewindows, and severalk files
  destroyed.
Both the disks and the computer are quite new, and are NOT heavily used,
only now and then.
AFAIR nv SATA driver.
Ic ould repeat these problems with big copying actions.
The problem with logging is that the computer freezes hard and nothing
remains in the log files.
Best wishes
Norbert
