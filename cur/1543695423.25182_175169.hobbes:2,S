Well almost.    There is still one significant flaw in the kernel space stuff.
The BIOS can specify arbitrary regions as reserved in the E820 map and then
a kernel driver can't use that region itself.  This shows up in corner
cases where the resource on the PCI device is a boolean rather than
a general purpose thing.  Particularly for mtd map drivers to allow
flashing your ROM from linux this is a problem.
This is not required for 2.6.0 but it would be nice to actually be able
to reliably reserve resources in kernel drivers.
