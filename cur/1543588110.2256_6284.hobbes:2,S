No, this is NOT what the UNIX dogmas are all about.
When UNIX says "everything is a file", it really means that "everything is
a stream of bytes". Things like magic operations on file desciptors are
_anathema_ to UNIX. ioctl() is the worst wart of UNIX. Having magic
semantics of file descriptors is NOT Unix dogma at all, it is a horrible
corruption of the original UNIX cleanlyness.
Please don't excuse "semaphore file descriptors" with the "everything is a
file" mantra. It is not at ALL applicable.
The "everything is a file" mantra is to make pipe etc meaningful -
processes don't have to worry about whether the fd they have is from a
file open, a pipe() system call, opening a special block device, or a
socket()+connect() thing. They can just read and write. THAT is what UNIX
is all about.
And this is obviously NOT true of a "magic file descriptors for
semaphores". You can't pass it off as stdin to another process and expect
anything useful from it unless the other process _knows_ it is a special
semaphore thing and does mmap magic or something.
The greatness of UNIX comes from "everything is a stream of bytes". That's
something that almost nobody got right before UNIX. Remember VMS
structured files? Did anybody ever realize what an absolutely _idiotic_
crock the NT "CopyFile()" thing is for the same reason?
Don't confuse that with "everything should be a file descriptor". The two
have nothing to do with each other.
