I don't think you need the change to the comments at the top of the
file.
Also, I thought we wanted to keep all of the pci class ids, why did you
delete them?  We should start by removing the pci device and vendor ids
that are not currently used by the kernel, and then slowly move those
ids into the individual drivers, starting with the device ids, and maybe
eventually moving to the vendor ids.
Sound ok?
thanks,
