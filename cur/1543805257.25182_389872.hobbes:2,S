Generally quite good again :)
I'm seeing this USB "handoff" warning message logged when booting up:
0000:00:1d.7 EHCI: BIOS handoff failed (BIOS bug ?)
This is not new to this -mm release, looking back over my bootlogs I note that 
2.6-15-rc5-mm1 was OK, but 2.6.15-mm4 was showing this message.  I'll narrow it 
down if it doesn't appear obvious what the problem is.
When it was working OK in earlier releases it was showing this at the same place 
in the boot as the message above is appearing (ie at the top near the scheduler 
registration stuff)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1d.7[A] -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> IRQ 20
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1d.7 to 64
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: EHCI Host Controller
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: debug port 1
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: irq 20, io mem 0xff2ff800
PCI: cache line size of 128 is not supported by device 0000:00:1d.7
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: USB 2.0 initialized, EHCI 1.00, driver 10 Dec 2004
On newer kernels this is appearing later on in the boot sequence instead, with 
the early and only message at the top being the single line failure message.
The box has the latest bios available, and it's an Intel D925XCV.  USB is 
working on the box (at least, a USB keyboard is...)
