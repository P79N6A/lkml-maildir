And I won't merge your patch ;)
Seriously, it does appear that doing it per-task is adequate for your
needs, and it is certainly more general.
I cannot understand why you decided to count only the number of
direct-reclaim events, via a "digitally filtered, constant time based,
event frequency meter".
a) It loses information.  If we were to export the number of pages
   reclaimed from the mm, filtering can be done in userspace.
b) It omits reclaim performed by kswapd and by other tasks (ok, it's
   very cpuset-specific).
c) It only counts synchronous try_to_free_pages() attempts.  What if an
   attempt only freed pagecache, or didbn't manage to free anything?
d) It doesn't notice if kswapd is swapping the heck out of your
   not-allocating-any-memory-now process.
I think all the above can be addressed by exporting per-task (actually
per-mm) reclaim info.  (I haven't put much though into what info that
should be - page reclaim attempts, mmapped reclaims, swapcache reclaims,
etc)
