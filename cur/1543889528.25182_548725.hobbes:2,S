that's not true, AFAICT.  the pattern seems to be that, in the case of
declarations, attributes go at the end, as in:
arch/sparc/boot/btfixupprep.c:void fatal(void) __attribute__((noreturn));
while in actual definitions, they typically go after the return type,
as in arch/arm/kernel/traps.c:
void __attribute__((noreturn)) __bug(const char *file, int line)
{
        printk(KERN_CRIT"kernel BUG at %s:%d!\n", file, line);
        *(int *)0 = 0;
        /* Avoid "noreturn function does return" */
        for (;;);
}
  is that the standard that most people use?  if it is, i can use that
standard for the cleanup.
