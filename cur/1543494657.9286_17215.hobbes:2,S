I use Linux for everything.  Firewalls, applications, programming, DB, etc.
Yes there is a lot that can be done.  What _can_ be done and what _needs_ to be
done are fairly different.

Yes.  32bit platforms are becoming irksome to me.  Perception has a strong
value even in the face of fact.  2gig file/mem is a complaint I hear very
frequently now.

Yes, there is.  With it being 100% of my company, I have less headache to deal
with and if necessary, it's easier to fix...generally from anywhere.  It's
easier, faster, and more accessible.

I would, in a heartbeat.  Tell me, do you feel more secure that they use
Microsoft?  You would rather they have Microsoft running your money, or Linux?
Have you seen an ATM lately running on Microsoft?  Keep your eyes open.  How
many kiosks do you walk past in a mall that are locked up with the familiar
BSOD or AE banners?

Yes.  We have a lot of work to do.  In comparison to the peers at the table, we
don't.  In comparison to `The Best' or `Perfect' OS, we have very much work to
do.
I don't advocate complacency in development, but I do think that negative
criticism only pisses people off.  Constructive criticism on the other hand is
well advised.
An axiom we could tender is to lend a strong shoulder to the future, don't
stand by the side nitpicking each other.  I am getting fidgity waiting for 2.3
to start :)
