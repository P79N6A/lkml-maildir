In the past, I have sent mail directly to Linus which has worked for 2.5.
Unfortunately, it looks like he has not applied the last bundle I posted
to him on 2003/03/25.  This is the same bk output as posted on my website.

It would be better to just upgrade the driver with bits I submitted to
Linus.  I have another update coming to correctly fix the del_timer_sync()
issue since the last, unsanctioned, change in this area has a large potential
to cause a deadlock.
