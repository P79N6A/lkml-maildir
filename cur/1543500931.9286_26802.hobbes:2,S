Suppose you want to lstat() and stat() the same object...  no way to do
it without a race condition.
And in recent discussions about chflags/lchflags/fchflags... so many new
syscalls.  With Albert's suggestion, only one is required.
Though Albert's suggestion does introduce a rather unlikely
denial-of-service problem: you'd be able to prevent an unreadable
filesystem from being unmounted by opening its root directory.
