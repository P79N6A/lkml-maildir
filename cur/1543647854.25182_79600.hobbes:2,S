Hi,
I would like to know whether a kind of parport exists for the serial ports.
This will allow me to do some low level accesses on the serial port pins (CTS/RTS & DSR/DTR).
I need to implement a bit-banging access on the serial port which can coexist with the other serial ports.
I can not use request_region/release_region because the region has already been locked by the serial port driver.
Any idea ?
