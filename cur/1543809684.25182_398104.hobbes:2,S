Andrew, Please don't apply this patch. This breaks the existing HT
(and multi-core) scheduler optimizations.
Peter, on a DP system with HT, if we have only two runnable processes
and they end up running on the two threads of the same package, 
with your patch, migration thread will never move one of those processes 
to the idle package..
To fix my reported problem, we need to make sure that find_busiest_group()
doesn't find an imbalance..
thanks,
suresh
