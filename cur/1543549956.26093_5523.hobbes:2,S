That's exactly what I'm doing.

The current version has some drawbacks, and one of them is the performance.
Memory accounting is implemented as a kernel thread which goes through page
tables of processes (similar to kswapd), and it appears to consume 1-5% of
CPU (depending on number of processes).  I consider it unacceptable, and have
started reimplementation of the process memory accounting from the beginning.
