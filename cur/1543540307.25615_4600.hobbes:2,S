It doesn't have to be, although that would be nice, and it really
should be a hanging offence to create new interfaces which export HZ
to user space.  The point is that when we change HZ in kernel space,
we will still export HZ == 100 to user space (i386), and we'll have to
do the conversion in kernel space.
