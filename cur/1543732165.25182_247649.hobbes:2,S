With this patch *without* a localversion file I get
ianw@baci:/tmp/kbuild-test$ make
cat: /tmp/kbuild-test/localversion*: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `/tmp/kbuild-test/localversion*', needed by `include/linux/version.h'.  Stop.
However, with the right files there it works as you describe.
The interaction with LOCALVERSION from the command line (i.e. make
LOCALVERSION=aversion) is still a bit funny too, since it won't cause
version.h to be rebuilt.  Is it going to just be a case of "you can't
specify LOCALVERSION" from the command line?
My original patch also had a Kconfig option which would be inserted; I
figured this might be good because if you're creating a bunch of
different configs you are probably in [menu|x]config to change the
options, so it might be convenient to just set it via a string in
there.  Would anyone else like to see that?
