I think we are good. How pci_save_state and pci_restore_state were
implemented and how they were used were out of sync.  tg3 was one
of the drivers where pci_save_state and pci_restore_state were used
as part of the reset routine and were not used in pairs.
Which when combined with a pci-x or a pci-express capability
resulted in a memory leak, (that I was warning about).  This
has now been corrected upstream.
And the condition I was warning about non paired pci_save_state and
pci_restore_state is no longer a problem.
