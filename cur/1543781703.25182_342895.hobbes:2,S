Looks like now it is the only user of exit_signal(), and I think
we can kill this function and just do:
bad_fork_cleanup_sighand:
	if (p->sighand) {
		// p->sighand can't change here, we don't need tasklist lock
		if (atomic_dec_and_test(p->sighand->count))
			// If we get here we are not sharing ->sighand with anybody else.
			// It means, in particular, that p had no CLONE_THREAD flag.
			// Nobody can see this process yet, we didn't call attach_pid(),
			// otherwise ->sighand was freed from __exit_signal. Thus nobody
			// can see this sighand.
			sighand_free(p->sighand);
	}
It is not an optimization, this path is rare, just to make things
more clear and to reduce "false positives" from grep tasklist_lock.
And I think it makes sense to
#define	put_sighand(sig)	\
	do if atomic_dec_and_test(sig->count) sighand_free(sig); while (0)
