Don't worry about it. We haven't always been too kind with lost RH 
piranha users in the past either ;).

LVS and its kernel modules are definitely actively maintained all the 
way from 2.2.x to 2.5.x kernels and if you want I'll make you a 2.0.x 
kernel version too. It's just that recently everybody got a bit busy and 
thus new releases tend to follow each other in increasing time intervals.
A patch would always be very welcome of course.
Best regards,
