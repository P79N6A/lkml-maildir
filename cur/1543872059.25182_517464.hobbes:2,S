Does this support non-blocking mode?  It doesn't seem to at my level of
understanding anyway.  If I use this with EPOLLET for example, I'd
expect to get a single EPOLLIN when a signal arrives, which would
indicate to me that I must call signalfd_dequeue() in a loop until I get
EAGAIN in order to be sure I've consumed all the outstanding signals so
that the edge-triggered notification can be "re-armed".
Make sense?
