Good point.  Speaking of which:
  ioctl(fd, UIOCATTACHSEMA, ...);
seems to act like dup(fd) if fd was opened on "/dev/usemaclone"
(see drivers/sgi/char/usema.c).  According to usema(7), this is
intended to help libraries implement semaphores.
Is this a bad coding?  Should the kernel really support an ioctl()
that can silently allocate the next file descriptor?  This seems
like asking for trouble.  Or, maybe I just misunderstood something.
