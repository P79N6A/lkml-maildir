Subject: linux-2.4.21 released ,  No changelog for sym53c8xx_2 mods ?

	Hello Marcello ,  I have a problem with the lack of changelog
	entries concerning the sym53c8xx_2 driver .  There are none .
	And yet there has been changes to the driver tree .
	As you'll note this includes the change log file in the driver
	tree as well .  I have grep'd and manually viewed the change logs
	from kernel.org with no mention of these changes noted .
	Also Mr. Roudier put out a patch set versioned sym-2.1.19-pre3 on
	20031123 which has never been insterted into 2.4 (possibly at his
	request) .  I have been using this patch since the above date
	without difficulty in every pre ,  rc & release since that date .
		Tia ,  JimL
