I plan to have saner limits for atomic allocations for 2.4. For the corner
cases, we can make then those limits tunable.
For 2.5, I guess we'll need some scheme for those corner cases, since they
will probably become more common (think about gigabit ethernet, etc).
I'm not sure yet which one will be used. Ben (bcrl@redhat.com) has a nice
scheme ready for reservation. But thats 2.5 only anyway.
