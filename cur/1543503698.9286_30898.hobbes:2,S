Hi,
I seem to be already using the VESA framebuffer:  
vesafb: framebuffer at 0xd8000000, mapped to 0xc4800000, size 8128k
vesafb: mode is 1024x768x24, linelength=3072, pages=2
vesafb: protected mode interface info at c000:4d41
vesafb: scrolling: redraw
vesafb: directcolor: size=0:8:8:8, shift=0:16:8:0
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
fb0: VESA VGA frame buffer device
and the machine does not only show a dark LCD but it locks up too.
Pressing the power button (configured to 'suspend-to-ram') produces
a never ending beep - fortunately a power off can be forced by pressing the
button for more than 5 seconds or so.
This happens at about 15 % of boot attempts (very rough estimate)
-------------
about X: I have tried all the variants listed in the URL below and now 
I am using vesafb + Mach64 server (only method that works). Performance is 100% Ok.
Unfortunately I was unable to find the right mode lines (XF86config) for
the 15" LCD - none of the config files given in the URL worked for me - just
a dark LCD which tends to become grey slowly which caused me to very 
quickly press ctrl-alt-bs to exit the X server (which worked fortunately).
The {manufacturer,assembler,whatever} (Gericom) is unable to determine 
the LCD panel manufacturer given the serial number ........
Additional experiences are very welcome.
------------
There is additional weirdness with this Notebook:
(Kapok 8500P - in Europe perhaps known as Gericom ????)
it seems to refuse to boot from any LILO boot sector no matter where
it is placed (partition table sector, boot sector of linux partition)
not even the first 'L' of the lilo prompt, simply: 'no operating system found'. 
(I have already written to Werner Almesberger about this but he seems to be
on vacation right now).
Greetings
-karl
