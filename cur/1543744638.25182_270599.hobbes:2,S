sorry - I was wrongly assuming mmconfig has to follow the same
semantics as config since it's intended as a replacement.
In short, the ECN answers Andi's question with "Yes" - thanks for
pointing it out.
For those who don't want to read the whole ECN, bits of it below.

Yes. I found it on page 5 of PciEx_ECN_MMCONFIG_040217.pdf.
AFAICT, this section only applies to "systems that implement a
processor-architecture-specific firmware interface standard".
e.g. ia64 SAL calls.

Well, Intel confirmed existing chipset comply with this bit of the ECN:
| For systems that are PC-compatible, or that do not implement a
| processor-architecture-specific firmware interface standard that
| allows access to the Configuration Space, the enhanced configuration
| access mechanism is required as defined in this section.
....
| The system hardware must provide a method for the system software
| to guarantee that a write transaction using the enhanced configuration
| access mechanism is completed by the completer before system software
| execution continues.

I assumed this one was meant:
