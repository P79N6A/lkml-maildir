No.
For reference, the article in question appeared in a British newspaper
called "Financial Times", which most people regard as respectable. I
didn't see the original article, but my brother showed me the one

decided to seek employment elsewhere", and assured readers that steps
were being taken to ensure that such not repeated...
Best wishes from Riley.
