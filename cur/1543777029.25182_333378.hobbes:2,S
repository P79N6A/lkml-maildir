Greetings.
I have an application that throuws some debug on STDOUT. Then, all of a 
sudden, some characters miss and the debug messages in STDOUT start to 
be treated as if they were shell commands! I read that in Linux, there's 
a non-printable character that "tells" STDOUT to handle its data as 
commands, but I'm not sure...
Has anyone faced this behavior before? Is it "normal"?
Thanks in advance
