Yeah using mapping_gfp_mask(mapping) sounds like a better option.
...and yes, there are other callers that need to be audited. I'm
particularly curious about the effect of the call in
block_invalidatepage() on XFS, which has a similar test to ours.
The call in fallback_migrate_page() should probably be using
mapping_gfp_mask() too.

Nope. In order to make it work correctly with NFS and XFS, all calls to
try_to_release_page() would have to be allowed to be blocking. The
problem is that shrink_page_list() still wants to call
try_to_release_page() from a memory allocation context.
