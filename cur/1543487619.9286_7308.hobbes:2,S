Some people, including me, have problems with the nfs performance on a
cluster with Linux PC clients and DEC Alpha OSF servers. I have tested
the kernel patch:
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.2/patch-2.2.2-ac4.bz2
 which
gives a better performance (400 kB/s instead of 250 kB/s with the
unpatched kernel), when i mount with options rsize=8192,
wsize=8192. If i tried it with sizes of 16384 (perhaps a bad idea),
the copy operation seams to use the full bandwidth (about 1MB/s), but
the file on the server has a lenght of 0. Is it possible, to configure
the server to manage that buffer sizes?
