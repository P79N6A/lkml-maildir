No, it could be either, both, or neither.  Heck, it _could_ be a
combination of all of the things in my experimental tree for that
matter.  I put this patch out there because I know they're both bugs,
and strongly suspect it'll cure the worst of the interactivity related
delays.
I'm hoping you'll test it and confirm that it fixes yours.
