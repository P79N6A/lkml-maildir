A kernel doesn't care whether its code survives or not.  Developers, OTOH,
do.  Some people *prefer* to wring the last drop of performance from an
existing design, because it's intellectually stimulating, and don't care
whether that design is or is not obsolete.  Someone will go on working on
Linux as long as it is still interesting to him, regardless of whether it
continues to interest you.
This sub-thread should probably migrate elsewhere.

Innovation is only valuable if it improves one's life; otherwise it's
just one more silly change to cope with.
