Subject: "Oops" in 2.6.9 SCSI w/ usb-storage & multi-LUN

We have found a reproducable kernel problem (looks like an oops, but
isn't...) in 2.6.9 somewhere related to the usb-storage driver, the SCSI
stack, and in particular multi-LUN devices. We have the SCSI multi-LUN
kernel configuration option enabled.
The basic scenario is that our application monitors for USB hotplug
notifications, and whenever a device is plugged, it will open that
device, and whenever the device is unplugged, it will close the
previously opened file descriptor. The monitoring is done by listening
to hotplug events on a netlink socket. We've back-ported the netlink
hotplug code from 2.6.10-rc3 to our 2.6.9 kernel.
The problem is, that when we unplug a device and go on to close the
filehandle, we get a kernel oops-like message. Our test  application
then hangs and can't be killed. This seems to be guaranteed to happen
with multi-LUN devices (e.g. multi-format memory "stick" readers) - in
this case, we open e.g. 4 devices on plug, and close those 4 devices on
unplug. The second close call hangs our application, and the oops-like
message is generated a few seconds after.
This seems to be somewhat timing sensitive. We have a test app written
in C++ that does exhibit the problem very reliably on two machines. The
simplified non-C++ version doesn't show the problem!
Both of these test applications are attached. Also attached is a patch
against 2.6.9 that adds netlink support to it, so you can try these test
apps under 2.6.9.
I've tried both test application under 2.6.10-rc3, and everything seems
to work fine on that kernel. I see there were a lot of USB changes in
2.6.10.
Does anyone know what change from 2.6.10 fixed this specific issue. Is
it something that's easy to isolate and back-port to 2.6.9?
