Dear Alan....
The memory has ECC (and neither EDAC_MC with K8 support, nor mcelog (I 
even tried to compile in both the AMD and intel MCE support) nor memtest 
does show me any errors.
Pleas have a look at my "new" post.... as this is definitely not FAT32 
related,.. I posted the whole thing unter a new thread (that that would 
be the correct way).
There you'll also find my latest results.
Thanks in advance for any further help :-)
Chris.
