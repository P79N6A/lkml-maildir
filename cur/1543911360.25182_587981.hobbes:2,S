Hi,
I agree with Chris on this point, it seems like this sort of detection
(and reporting) should be a job for a user-space daemon, rather than
polluting kernel code (and logs) with warning messages of this sort...
I don't think the type of warning this patch yields is appropriate for
kernel logs, nor do I think the kernel should be the entity to decide
that this warning should be given.
It _feels_ wrong.
