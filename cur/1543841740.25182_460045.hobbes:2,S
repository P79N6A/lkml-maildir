__read_mostly? Except for those variables which are being tweaked
quite often by live scheduler code... (probably none)
This only concerns the case of CONFIG_DEBUGFS_SCHED being activated,
but it may still be nice to have, I think, since scheduler stuff
should rather be fast than slow.
But since it is a debugging-only option omitting __read_mostly may
make sense...
