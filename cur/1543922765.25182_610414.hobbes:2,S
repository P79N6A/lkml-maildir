Great, thanks a lot for looking at it, Neil and Pekka.

It doesn't show up in the diff at all, but pageout() already has
		if (!PageWriteback(page)) {
			/* synchronous write or broken a_ops? */
			ClearPageReclaim(page);
		}
which will clear it since we've never set PageWriteback.
I think no harm would come from leaving it set there, since it only
takes effect in end_page_writeback (its effect being to let the just
written page be moved to the end of the LRU, so that it will then
be soon reclaimed), and clear_page_dirty_for_io clears it before
coming down this way.  But I'd never argue for that: I hate having
leftover flags hanging around outside the scope of their relevance.

That is a splendid retort, which has won you absolution.
But it makes me a little sad: that smiley should be a weepy.

No, it's not the case; but you're right that I should add something
there, to put an end to the idea.  It'll be something along the lines
of "You may notice shmem setting PageActive there, but please don't do
that; or if you insist, be sure never to do so in the !wbc->for_reclaim
case".
The PageActive thing is for when a filesystem regrets that it even
had a ->writepage (it replicates the behaviour of the writepage == NULL
case or the VM_LOCKED SWAP_FAIL case or the !add_to_swap case, delaying
the return of this page to writepage for as long as it can).  It's done
in shmem_writepage because shm_lock (equivalent to VM_LOCKED) is only
discovered within that writepage, and no-swap is discovered there too.
ramdisk does it too: I've not tried to understand ramdisk as Nick and
Eric have, but it used to have no writepage, and would prefer to have
no writepage, but appears to need one for some PageUptodate reasons.
It's fairly normal for a filesystem to find that for some reason it
cannot carry out a writepage on this page right now (in the reclaim
case: the sync case demands action, IIRC); so it then simply does
set_page_dirty and unlock_page and returns "success".
I'll try to condense this down for the Doc when finalizing the patch;
which I've still not yet tested properly - thanks for the eyes, but
I can't submit it until I've checked in detail that it really gets
to do what we think it does.
