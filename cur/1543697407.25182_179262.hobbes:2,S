Hi Linus!
The good people at Cambridge made a (very nice) VMM that exploits 
ring0/1/3 to let one machine run various kernels independently (the 
kernels need to be ported to the xen arch).
Xen itself executes in ring0 and the "guest" operating systems execute 
in ring1. User code runs in ring3, as usual. They have linux running 
under xen ;)
The project's home page is at 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/
 and one paper describing 
the whole thing is here:
