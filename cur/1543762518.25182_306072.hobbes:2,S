I wonder why ALPS reconnect failed. You don't have a serial console
set up, do you? If not then maybe you could make a huge framebuffer to
capture as much info as you can... I hope you have a digital camera ;)
Then do "echo 1 > /sys/modules/i8042/parameters/debug" and try to
suspend. I am interested of data coming in and out of i8042.
