You might be interested in trying a small tool I wrote to perform some 
parallel write tests on different linux filesystems.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107661735307313&w=2
At the time that I wrote the tool, 18 months ago, both ext3 and 
reiserfsV3 performed fairly badly at handling concurrent writes and only 
JFS and XFS excelled. Since then I believe the ext3 performance has been 
greatly improved due to the block reservation scheme added in 2.6.10. 
AFAIK the reiserfs performance is only addressed in reiserfsV4.
The test code is fairly trivial and could be easily adapted to simulate 
other workloads (like a web server) to help to optimise your filesystem 
and driver performance.
tiobench provides another threaded IO test
