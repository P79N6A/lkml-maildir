Ah, so in a normal scenario where a working-set is getting faulted
back in, we have the swap storage as well as the file-backed stuff
that needs to be read as well. So even if swap is organized perfectly,
we're still seeking. Damn.
On the other hand, that explains another thing that swap prefetch
could be helping with -- if it preemptively faults the swap back in,
then the file-backed stuff can be faulted back more quickly, just by
the virtue of not needing to seek back and forth to swap for its
stuff. Hadn't thought of that.
That also implies that people running with swap files rather than swap
partitions will see less of an issue. I should dig out my old compact
flash card and try putting swap on that for a week.

He'd suggested using, uhm, ptrace_peek or somesuch for just such a
purpose. The second half of the issue is to know when and what to
target.
