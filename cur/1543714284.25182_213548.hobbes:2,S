Here are refreshed patches (now BETA quality) against recent kernels:
    
http://www.bitwagon.com/elfdiet/elfdiet-2.6.5-mm5-1.patch.gz
    
http://www.bitwagon.com/elfdiet/elfdiet-2.6.5.patch.gz
(Patch mechanics: take 2.6.5, apply -mm5-1 [if desired], then apply
the corresponding elfdiet patch.)
A short introduction with links to past and future patches is:
