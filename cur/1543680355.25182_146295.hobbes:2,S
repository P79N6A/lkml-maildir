Use zone->pressure (rathar than scanning priority) to determine when to start
reclaiming mapped pages in refill_inactive_zone(). When using priority every
call to try_to_free_pages() starts with scanning parts of active list and
skipping mapped pages (because reclaim_mapped evaluates to 0 on low
priorities) no matter how high memory pressure is.
