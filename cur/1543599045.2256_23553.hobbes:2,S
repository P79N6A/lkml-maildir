_THAT_ _IS_ _WRONG_.  Who the fuck said that we always want type of _first_
argument?  Mind you, IMNSHO Dave had been on a seriously bad trip when he
had added that "type" argument - separate names would be cleaner.  And yes,
it'd be better in prepatch instead of 2.4.9-final.
However, no matter which variant you pick, old code with min/max
was broken.  Unless you are carefully giving right types (preferanly -
with casts) it works only by accidents (if it works at all).
"Compatibility option" is exactly the worst thing in such cases.
It's either changing the whole codebase or not bothering at all.
