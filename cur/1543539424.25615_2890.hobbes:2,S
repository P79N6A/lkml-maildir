Hi Linda,
You asked:
> If I am a running process, and I am looking at say, my audit mask, 
> do I need to lock it?
and I assume "looking" means not just reads but potentially writes.
I am sorry if this is already answered or if you figured it out yourself
(haven't looked at all of your thread) but I would recommend reading the
Chapter 7 of volume III of Intel PIII manuals:
http://developer.intel.com/design/pentiumii/manuals/243192.htm
or at least section 7.1.1 which says that the following basic memory
operations will always be carried out atomically:
1. reading/writing a byte
2. reading/writing a word aligned on a 16-bit boundary
3. reading/writing a doubleword aligned on a 32-bit boundary.
additionally, on P6 only:
4. reading/writing a quadword aligned on a 64bit boundary
5. 16-bit access to uncached memory that fit within a 32-bit data bus
6. 16/32/64-bit access to cached memory that fit within a 32-byte cache
line
This has practical implications in coding kernel code. For example a
little module I wrote in the past called timetravel (for Linux y2k
testing) updates some entries in sys_call_table[] which is declared using
ENTRY() macro in arch/i386/kernel/entry.S. If you look at ENTRY() you will
find that it is aligned well-enough for such updates to be guaranteed to
be atomic.
Hope this helps.
Regards,
Tigran
