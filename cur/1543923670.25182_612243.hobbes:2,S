Is it valid to send events from within ->resume device method? If not, what is 
the proper way to notify user space about hardware changes during suspension? 
Specifically it seems that new sysfs ACPI power supply interface sometimes 
missing plugged in AC cord during suspend. I suspect that no event is 
generated for this; I am not sure whether ACPI is required to generate such 
events at all in this case.
I'll need some time to get reproducible case so I do not categorize this yet 
as regression.
