Except that we don't want to (and can't[*]) disable preemption in the
cpufreq case. Therefore, we __need__ to disable CPU hotplug specifically,
and not meddle with other issues like preemption, scheduling, CPUs which are
in the allowed_map, and so on. So back to the original patch: Rusty, do you
agree with it?
Thanks,
