Hi.
The device already has write permission for the user using the
drive... and this is not the point.
The point is
	a. the user (program) wants to read a protected DVD,
	b. the user has permission to read the device,
	c. since kernel 2.6.8 the user can't use his right to read a
	DVD media, because according to verify_command() he is forced
	to open the device with RW mode instead of RONLY.
This is true for protected media because of the authentication
process needed between "host" 	and DVD device. IMHO,
the classification of the opcodes
	a. GPCMD_SEND_KEY and
	b. GPCMD_SET_STREAMING
as only "save for write" is wrong.
Furthermore, if you use
	a. cdrom_ioctl (..., DVD_AUTH,...) instead of
	b. cdrom_ioctl (..., CDROM_SEND_PACKET,...)
	-> scsi_cmd_ioctl()-> sg_io()-> verify_command()
the same authentication procedure works as expected on a
RONLY opened device!
Please rethink your decisions introduced with verify_command()
and make for example VMware work _again_ with Video DVDs.

Elias
