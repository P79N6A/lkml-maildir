I'm using the broken-out tree as I am trying to integrate the patches
into a custom Fedora Kernel (basically Fedora's kernel patches, with
CK added), and given the nature of RPM build (well not that, but the
way the .speck is put together for Fedora) I chose to go with the
broken out tree and apply most patches (those which are not repeted)
one by one. I apparently found out what the problem was: for some
reason schedbatch and schediso were failing at placing the #define's
in place for SCHED_BATCH and SCHED_ISO in sched.h, an easy fix when
done by hand, directly to the file in question. I am trying to see how
to merge these two into one, but you're right, I may be off better
going with the "full" version rather than the broken-out (it's given
me more head-aches than it is apparently worth having! hehe)
Thanks for your reply and for adding my e-mail, Con. I thought this
e-mail address was already allowed to send e-mail to the list...
