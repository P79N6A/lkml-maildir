The kernel is compiled with some objects differently according to the
compiler features. In paticular we have to pad out structures with 0 length
elements in the older compilers to fix a compiler bug. You must
compile with the same precise compiler and options as the kernel itself.

gcc 2.96-54 had plenty of bugs, 2.96-75+ should be perfectly fine for
all uses. If you have a 2.96 RH problem please report it in Red Hat
bugzilla - the gcc core folks won't be too interested as they are focused
on 2.95.4 and 3.0.1 bug fixing.
