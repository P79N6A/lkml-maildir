Hi,
I've just build and booted 2.6.4-rc1-mm2, and mounting my NFS exports
works. however when I try to unzip a file over those mount the process
freezes over and any other IO to that mount results in more stuck
processes. SIGKILL will not remove the processes, only reboot will
manage.
dmesg reports like:
nfs: server 192.168.0.1 not responding, timed out
which is total nonsense, because all other hosts on the network can
access the exports just fine.
I'm about to back out all nfs patches from the broken-out patch set to
see what that does for me.
