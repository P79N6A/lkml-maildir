This is already done -- the userspace ABI is defined in ib_user_mad.h,
ib_user_verbs.h, etc.
The problem with keeping subsystem headers under drivers/infiniband is
that it's ugly for, say, fs/nfs/Makefile to have to add
-Idrivers/infiniband/include to its CFLAGS just because it's
implementing NFS/RDMA.
Also, drivers/infiniband/include doesn't get put into the
/lib/modules/<ver>/build directory, so it's a pain for people
developing new drivers (this is a real complaint that came to me from
a vendor developing a driver for a new piece of IB hardware).
Thanks,
  Roland
