Now I can work with an USB keyboard connected to USB or with an "normal" 
PS/2 keyboard connected to the PS/2 pins via a standard PS/2 Slotblech 
Adapter.

Yes - as I said it works without problems, when I boot the 2.4.18 kernel

Yes

Yes - The receiver is only connecet to the keyboard dataa and keyboard 
clock pins of the PS/2 connector., but that should be enough :-)
Bye
Helmut
