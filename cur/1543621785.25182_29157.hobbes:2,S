It would be EOT, but there don't seem to _be_ any esd developers. I'd take a
look but my C skills max out at about "hello world", and there wouldn't be
anyone to make a new release (google couldn't find a esd homepage at least).
Maybe the gnome/ximian folks are taking bug reports/fixes in their packages.
Who knows? This has come up several times with nary a peep from a esd
developer.
