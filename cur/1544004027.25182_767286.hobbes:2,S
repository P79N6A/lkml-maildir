Okay, I've stared at a bunch of different transformations of this data
and I'm starting to think that it's getting lost in the noise.  The
difference between your "idleticks" and "idleticks2" data sets, for
example, is as big as the differences between any two data sets that I
can see.
Just for reference, see this graph where I have filtered out events
outside the [30..1000] cycle range and renormalized.

I don't know how to even figure out what a realistic error range looks
like, other than repeating each run something like 100+ times and do an
"eye chart" kind of diagram.
