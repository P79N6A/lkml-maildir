Hi Andrew, list,
I'm booting 2.5.59mm5 to run a database workload benchmark that I've been
running against various kernels.  I'll post those results if they are
interesting later, but I did notice that the raid1 resync is proceeding at
half the speed (at best) that it usually does (vs. 2.5.59 that is).
It currently at about 4-8 mb/sec (and falling as resync progresses),
usually at 12-15 mb/sec.
System is SMP 2xPIII 866mhz, 2GB ram, raid1 is two 15k U160 (running only
an Ultra speed :-( because the onboard controller sucks) SCSI disks, same
channel on aic7xxx.
Kernel is 2.5.59-mm5 compiled with gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat 
Linux 7.3 2.96-112)
David
