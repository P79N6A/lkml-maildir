That's a nice application of semaphores.  I can see that there's also a
need to be able to read the value back for reporting purposes.  Dang.
But I guess it's a bit hard to justify adding more infrastructure to
support a single callsite which has a simple alternative.  So if you could
please add the separate counter?

True.
