I don't think you can use "usually" and "fact" together like that. Why
is it so bad to account for them since they (do) surface and (could)
increase significantly in frequency? 
For me, the (could) is enough to act upon, regardless of the current
likely hood of it happening. Things change frequently. 
This, unfortunately comes pre-distorted depending on what you believe.
All of us are right but we still don't agree. Quite a fluke. 
That's the problem.
Best,
