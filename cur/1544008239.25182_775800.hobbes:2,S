To be precise, I was recommending passing the return value of
security_path* down to security_inode* explicitly rather than doing it
implicitly as you presently do.  Thereby making the actual control flow
and relationship between the security_path* and security_inode* hooks
evident.  However, I guess that is moot given your statements below.

I'm more concerned with the hook interface being understandable and
maintainable.

I'm not clear on why that requires a separate argument; if the caller is
passing in the access decision result as an input, then certain callers
(e.g. stackable filesystems) can always pass 0 (success).

It sounds like the existing security_path* hooks are not adequate for
your needs then, and that patch should not in fact be merged.  Yes?

Then I guess you need to redo your patches along those lines and
re-submit them.  Likely starting with just a patch adding the
security_path_set/clear hooks, posted to lsm and fsdevel.
