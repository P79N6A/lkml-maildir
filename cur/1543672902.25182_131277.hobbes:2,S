the doc is not very clear, I see this in 11.6.3
"The denormal-are-zeo flag in MXCSR was introduced in later Pentium
4 processor and in the Intel Xeon processor"

Not for intel at least since they advocate to use the mask as
a "is this feature present" and use mask 0xFFBF if mask == 0
and since this bits was required to be zero I think it's safe.
The only problem we can get is an old processor which write non
zero but random bits in the 16 upper bits.

my documentation says to fxsave and get the features mask from
the mxcsr mask but to fall back to 0xffbf if mask == 0, quoting
docs 11.6.6:
1 setup a fxsave area
2 clear this area
3 fxsave in this area
4 if mxcsr == 0 use mask 0xffbf else use mxcsr mask
"All bits set to 0 in this mask indicate reserved bits in
the mxcsr register. Thus, if this mask value is AND'd with
a value to be written in the MXCSR register, the resulting
value will be assured of having all its reserved bits set
to 0, preventing the possibility of a general protection
exception being generated when the value is written to the
MXCSR register"
then the documentation show an example using this mechanism
for daz flag and add the following note:
"Note than all bits in the MXCSR_MASK value are set to 1 indicate
features supported byt the MXCSR register; so the bits in the
MXCSR_MASK can also treated as a features flags for identifying
processor capabilities"

Phil
