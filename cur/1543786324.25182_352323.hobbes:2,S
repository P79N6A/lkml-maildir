My best guess from the little information available is that this looks 
like 4k stacks being used together with reiserfs and a stack overflow 
corrupting the stack away.
Your .config would be helpful to confirm this, though.
I would suggest you turn CONFIG_4KSTACKS off or use a different filesystem.
