For something added in the past and removed later...

No, they are mainly for concision. Don't you think it's cleaner to write
        PAGES_KB(VM_MAX_READAHEAD)
than
        (VM_MAX_READAHEAD * 1024) / PAGE_CACHE_SIZE
Admittedly the names are somewhat awkward though :)

The macros were first introduced exact for this reason ;)
It is rumored that there will be 64K page support, and this macro
helps round up the 16K sized VM_MIN_READAHEAD. The eof_index also
needs rounding up.

Ok, will expand it.
