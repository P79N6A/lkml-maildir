hi,
After I installed a newer version of Kernel (2.4.2) and enable DMA option in
hardware configuration, the behavior changes.
I can see performance improvements when another thread is used. Also, i can
see timing overlaps between two threads. i.e. when one thread is blocked on a
page fault, other thread keeps working.
Now, how can this behavior be explained , given the earlier argument.
Is it that, a newer version of kernel has fixed the problem of the semaphore
?
thanks
