No. And there's a very good reason why this isn't implemented.
Writing out to swap isn't very performance critical (well, it
is, but not as much as reading). If we tune performance for
writing, we will probably put things on disk in such a way
that the (more critical) reading will have to be done in a
very nonoptimal way. A big no-no...
And even if the negative effects would be minimal, it just
wouldn't be worth it to make this optimization.
