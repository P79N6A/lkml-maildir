This is very strange. Is the client machine constant? What kernel does
it use? Is it reproducible against multiple client kernels? This sounds
like a fairly serious regression. Are you always using tux as the httpd?
What about other httpd's?

I will at least attempt to reproduce this behavior. I'm suspicious that
the problem could lie in a dark corner only tangentially VM-related, as
you seem to be able to reproduce it under a variety of VM's.
