Indeed -- I've reported this twice -- exactly same synptoms.
[ I have a perl script run from cron to report back what was incorrect ]
Also, I've still had no feedback on locking not working if the file does not 
have world read access (e.g. mail files) ...
Also, anyone got raid0145 patches for 2.3.1 or later ?
