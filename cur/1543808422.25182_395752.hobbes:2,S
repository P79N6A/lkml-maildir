Hello, list,
I have a little problem, with netconsole.
It does not work for me.
On the "client":
modprobe netconsole netconsole=@/,514@192.168.2.100/
dmesg:
netconsole: local port 6665
netconsole: interface eth0
netconsole: remote port 514
netconsole: remote IP 192.168.2.100
netconsole: remote ethernet address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
netconsole: local IP 192.168.2.50
netconsole: network logging started
(kernel: 2.6.15-rc5, and 2.6.16-rc1,2)
On the server:
]# netcat -u -l -v -s 192.168.2.100 -p 514
192.168.2.100: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
listening on [192.168.2.100] 514 ...
And nothing comes.
The firewall is off on both system.
The ping comes from any direction.
If i try the remote and local syslog, it works well, two.
And in this case, the netlog only displays what the syslog is sends.
What can be the problem?
Thanks,
Janos
