I think we would need to have two dirty lists, one of kupdate, and one of
kflushd. We insert all dirty buffers in the kflushd list and only some
into the kupdate one. Then we should design a user->kernel API to be able
to tell which blockdevice doesn't want kupdate. It would slowdown kupdate
a little bit, I think not noticeable in real life. But I don't think it
worth.
