Just to confirm I'm seeing this also.  I've a machine with 512mb ram and a
gig of swap.  Running a filesystem i/o stress test app causes the machine
to pretty much run out of memory.  The swap is hardly touched.  Then the
VM starts killing things...klogd, the file i/o app, the shell it was in...
I didn't see any significant change here with the patch.
Here's meminfo prior to and towards the end of things for what it's worth:
