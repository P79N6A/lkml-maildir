Hi,
I compiled in FAT support as a module for the 2.2.12 kernel which I just
downloaded last night.  Well, it's complaining, and even after grepping
the source and grepping some more, I can't find out what I'm missing from
my kernel:
/lib/modules/2.2.12/fs/fat.o: unresolved symbol load_nls
/lib/modules/2.2.12/fs/fat.o: unresolved symbol load_nls_default
/lib/modules/2.2.12/fs/fat.o: unresolved symbol unload_nls
/lib/modules/2.2.12/fs/fat.o: unresolved symbol utf8_wcstombs
And of course since fat.o has unresolved symbols, what I *really* need
(vfat.o) can't load!  =/
What are these symbols for?  I turned on code page 437 support (that's the
cp that I use in the DOS world, when I'm actually *there*).
