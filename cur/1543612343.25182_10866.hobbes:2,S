You can trace them, but strace will ignore the setuid bit on the process,
for example if you strace su, you will see a lot of permission denied, as
it won't actually run as root, and won't be able to open things like
/etc/shadow or /proc/self/fd/0.  If you want to strace setuid things and
have the setuid bit honored, you have to run strace as root with the -u
option.
