ITYM s/6/7/.
None of the variants. A: version-dependent and "just like" part is seriosuly
misleading. B: would be correct for old versions _if_ they would add "and
filesystem is presumed to be block-based". As it is, statement is blatantly
incorrect - some filesystems always could be mounted in many places. C:
not even funny. _None_ of the UNIX flavours I've seen has such limitation -
they either refuse to do second mount at all or they do not care about
relative location in the tree. D: see C.
Correct answer: on versions prior to 2.4 block-based filesystems can be
mounted only once. On 2.4 either do mount -t <whatever> /dev/hda2 /users
or mount --bind /var /users.
