Ok...
reiserfsck --check said I have to do --rebuild-tree because of critical corruption (many "bad_leaf: block xxxxx has wrong order of items")...
after that I booted into 2.4.17. Everything works okay.
Then I booted 2.5.5-pre1 and the mysterious files are there again after starting GNOME. I've copied one file to another location but when I reboot into 2.4.17 the files and the copy are gone again...
If you need one or two file names or the content of them just ask (They begin with an "^")... then I'll handcopy them ;)
The format of the partition is 3.6 and another partition with 3.5 format had no errors... Maybe this helps
I could build 2.5.5-pre1 without your patch from the last mail but for this try I have build the kernel with it
