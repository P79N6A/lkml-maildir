Excellent. Then I apologise for not reading the documentation.
After the discussion of MAC and SCSI config options many moons ago in this
thread, I was left with the impression that the constraints which were 
being objected to were not dependent upon a NOVICE mode, but were 
unconditional.
Was this merely a mistake in the conversion of the ruleset? Do you have a 
policy that the default behaviour should be similar to that of CML1, or at 
least that such behaviour should be available through one of the 
modes? If not, please consider doing so.
