Hi,
Should genhd.h:set_capacity() find and update the i_size field of the
inode for the device ?
The BLKGETSIZE and BLKGETSIZE64 ioctls report the size in the devices
inode:
	case BLKGETSIZE:
		if ((bdev->bd_inode->i_size >> 9) > ~0UL)
			return -EFBIG;
		return put_ulong(arg, bdev->bd_inode->i_size >> 9);
	case BLKGETSIZE64:
		return put_u64(arg, bdev->bd_inode->i_size);
Currently people have to close and reopen the device in order for a
size change to take effect.  This is a problem if people want to do
online resizing of a filesystem (supported by xfs and resier).
