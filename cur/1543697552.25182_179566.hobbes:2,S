I saw that Linux is using a 3 level page tables, pgd, pmd and pte. The value
in the pte can refer to an actual page in memory OR an address on the swap
device. How does the kernel distinguish the two values such that if the
value is refering to an swap device address, it will not lookup the address
in memory ??
