I notice that you didn't actually answer any of the questions above, just
a nice hand wave that says "it need not be so".  Well, just to indulge
me, could you please either:
    a) answer the questions above, or
    b) show a shipping, production system which demonstrates your claims, or
    c) admit that you don't know the answer.
: I wasn't arguing that 16 way SMP is OK.  Everyone knows it isn't.
Geez, and this from the guy who said Linux needs to support "16-64 way SMP".
: Are you saying that clusters of small SMP machines are better?

: So the locking 
: moves from the kernels to the application layer.  You still have the same 
: synchronization concerns, it's just a matter of what layer they are 
: implemented at.
Err, if you had actually done this, you'd find that your statements
are unsupportable in practice.  Please show me an application that has
anything, even with an order of magnitude, like the number of locks
taken/released per second in IRIX or Solaris.
