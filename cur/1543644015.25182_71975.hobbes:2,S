I do remember that I have one board in my company that doesn't like KVMs 
at all (please don't ask for the brand, I'm offsite for a while and 
don't remember the type). All other boards connected to KVMs (different 
types) and running Linux 2.4 (various versions) work fine.
So I guess you do have a hardware (board) problem.
