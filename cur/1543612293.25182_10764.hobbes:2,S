Hi
i would like to know how the network layer does to know what is the upper 
layer protocol in order to fill in correctly the protocol field in the 
header it adds to the packet before sending it. I'm doing a ethernet device 
that doesn't add any header to the packet but change the output device, 
then i should say the network device that the packet is like if it has been 
sent by the ip protocol.
Thanks,
Romain Giry
