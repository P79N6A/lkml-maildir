Hi !
I'm having troubles with newer via-rhine drivers (1.1.17) and older
via-rhine hardware (VT86C100A [Rhine] (rev 06)).
With moderate CPU load (10-15 %) and some network load
(a couple of houndred kbps) I'm repeatedly getting:
  Jul  1 19:56:52 ip2 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
  Jul  1 19:56:52 ip2 kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status 0000, PHY
  status 782d, resetting...
Everything works just smoothly with via-rhine 1.1.15.
This machine does not have ACPI (or APM) enabled.
Regards.
/Håkan
