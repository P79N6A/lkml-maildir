(Please CC me on replies)
I have a question regarding the inode number on the EXT2 filesystem. If I 
get a Inode number, is there a way I can calculate the block address (with 
respect to the filesystem) on this inode base on the inode number?
I know for UFS, you can calculate the address of the inode base on the inode 
number.
Also, I remember reading somewhere that not all the EXT2 block groups have 
superblock information. So would the beginning of those block group look 
like this " group descriptor | block bitmap | inode bitmap | inode table | 
data " ? And, could someone please tell me which block groups have 
superblock info.
Thank you for your time.
Jim
