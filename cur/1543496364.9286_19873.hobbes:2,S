Ah!! You are perfectly right, I had a bug in my recover_lost_ticks code!
But the bug is really really silly, just look the incremental bugfix:

:-))
It's been when I had complains by people who didn't liked the idea to make
the kernel robust against lost-irqs. Their complains was that the TSC can
be resetted with APM enabled if I remeber well. So to fix the problem I
added in some second the broken #if sequence above, but I achieved the
opposite effect of what I wanted :-).
Basically so far my code was trusting the irq with APM enabled and was
only giving you a warning without APM compiled...
But with the fix applyed my recover-lost-ticks code will return to go in
read-_write_ mode and it should update your system time to the right value
according to the number of ticks lost.
I would be glad if you would try again my recover_lost_ticks with the
bugfix above applyed and confirm that my code make your machine robust
against frequent lost ticks.
I think there still an issue with settimeofday run in the middle of a lost
irq. But I'll address it leather since it's less priority.
Thanks!
