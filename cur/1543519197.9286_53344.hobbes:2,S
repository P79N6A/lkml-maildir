I have seen that same effect with tulip, eepro100 and epic100 cards.
All of those cards use drivers by Donald Becker with a (since a while)
known design problem. You are using:

I bet this is the same bug. Patches are floating around for the
tulip driver, there is an alternative eepro100 driver, but I don't
know of fixes for the epic100 or 3c59x.
