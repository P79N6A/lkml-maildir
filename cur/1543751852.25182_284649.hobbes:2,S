When loading the powernow-k8 module on any recent kernel (I've tried
2.6.8 through 2.6.10) on my Sempron laptop, I see:
powernow-k8: Found 1 AMD Athlon 64 / Opteron processors (version 1.00.09e)
powernow-k8:    0 : fid 0x8 (1600 MHz), vid 0x6 (1400 mV)
powernow-k8:    1 : fid 0x0 (800 MHz), vid 0x18 (950 mV)
cpu_init done, current fid 0x8, vid 0x4
powernow-k8: vid trans failed, vid 0x3, curr 0x4
powernow-k8: transition frequency failed
powernow-k8: vid trans failed, vid 0x3, curr 0x4
powernow-k8: transition frequency failed
... and many more of those 'vid trans failed' errors (one every time
there's an attempted freq change).
There is a small patch available at...
http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-3585.html
...which seems to fix the problem. Should this be included into the
kernel officially?
