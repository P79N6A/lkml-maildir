because the SLAB hacks were getting ugly, and i gave up on it during the 
2.6.15-rc5 merge. (The SLAB code has lots of irqs-off / per-cpu and 
non-preempt assumptions integrated, which were a pain to sort out.)
We'll eventually do a cleaner conversion of SLAB to PREEMPT_RT, but for 
now the SLOB is turned on exclusively if PREEMPT_RT. (in other 
preemption modes it's optionally selectable if EMBEDDED is enabled)
