An update on this.
Line #3 above is not entirely correct in that I have not seen the item
being added becoming immediately corrupt, but rather items beyond it.
Specifically I have now seen:
  inode_unused->next->next->prev != inode_unused->next
and:
  inode_unused->next->next->next->prev != inode_unused->next->next
My verification function doesn't check the whole inode_unused list (would
be too slow to do so), but it may be that items are only corrupted shortly
after being added to the list.  Ie., someone is still using the inode
shortly after when they shouldn't be.

No word yet on my 2.4.24 testing.  (test still running without failure)
I'll keep digging,
