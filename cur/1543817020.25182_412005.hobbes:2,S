I was thinking to change the global count to "unsigned long", but we
still need to use signed value (long) for the per cpu counters(local
counter), as they are relative values and could be negative.
Something like this:
struct percpu_counter {
        spinlock_t lock;
-       long count;
+	unsigned long count;
        long *counters;
};
This works for ext2/3, as the global value always initialized to some
positive value (e.g. the # of free blocks when the filesystem is
created). But I am concerned the current other two users of percpu
counters(nr_files in VFS and memory_allocated in network code), where
the global value could be initilized to 0, and will have the issue that
you just described.

Wild suggestion, how about we don't update the global counter is the
result is negative?

Okey, that's good to know.
