Well I think this is something that we should document.
The question is what is the appropriate mechanism for synchronising
a direct write to DMA coherent memory and a subsequent writel().
include/asm-ppc/system.h says that mb() should be used, while
include/asm-ppc64/system.h says that wmb() should be and is used by
many drivers.
So which is it? Or perhaps we need something else?
Cheers,
