Hardly. 
There are places that store the struct pid and try to obtain its number
later. E.g. tiocgpgrp() wants to tell user the pgrp nr of the tty's 
active group; fgetown() tells user the number of file's owner pid or (!)
pgrp; file locks need to store the pid and report it later (this is not 
implemented yet, I'm still working on it) and so on and so forth.
Thanks,
Pavel
