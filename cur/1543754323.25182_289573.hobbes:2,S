I figured it out.
I had in the makefile
subdir-$(CONFIG_GRSECURITY) += grsecurity/
I had to use obj- instead.
This is just an academic thing-- I'm rewriting GrSecurity's invasive
code as a bunch of hooks, collapsing what I can down, and making a
stackable (easy) security framework from scratch (what the hell am I
doing?).  I'm not modifying LSM, though I did rip off the
security_initcall things (did I just create a new .text section in
vmlinuz?  o.o).
Thanks for your comments though.  I'll look to them if I have trouble in
the future.
