Here it is. This must go in 2.6.17.

Fix for bug #6395:
Fail to resume on Tecra M2 with ADM1032 and Intel 82801DBM
The BIOS of the Tecra M2 doesn't like it when it has to reboot or
resume after the i2c-i801 driver has left the SMBus in PEC mode. The
most simple fix is to clear the PEC bit after after every transaction.
That's what this driver was doing up to 2.6.15 (inclusive).
Thanks to Daniele Gaffuri for the very good report.
