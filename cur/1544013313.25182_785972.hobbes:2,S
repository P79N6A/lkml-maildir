Thanks!
Stable maintainers, please consider this for 2.6.27 stable as well
(in addition to 28).  (Attaching the tip/x86/urgent commit as reference to
the patch)
Thanks,

    x86: fix incorrect __read_mostly on _boot_cpu_pda
    The pda rework (commit 3461b0af025251bbc6b3d56c821c6ac2de6f7209)
    to remove static boot cpu pdas introduced a performance bug.
    _boot_cpu_pda is the actual pda used by the boot cpu and is definitely
    not "__read_mostly" and ended up polluting the read mostly section with
    writes.  This bug caused regression of about 8-10% on certain syscall
    intensive workloads.
