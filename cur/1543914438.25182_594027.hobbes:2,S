Well, size is one problem I had in mind.  There are a _lot_ of USB 
devices in existence.
But mainly it's a question of maintenance and modification.  Kernel
developers don't really enjoy maintaining black- or whitelists of
devices, together with all the work involved in sorting through the
issues when somebody posts an email saying "My device doesn't work!".
Also, modifying device lists in the kernel tends to be a slow process, 
involving at least one kernel release cycle.  It's much easier for 
people to maintain userspace databases.  Now I realize you proposed 
there be a userspace interface for modifying the kernel's whitelist -- 
but if you're going to do that, why not put the entire whitelist in 
userspace to begin with?
Maybe you're concerned about propagating updates as painlessly as 
possible -- if the whitelist is in the kernel then every kernel release 
would include an update.  But in userspace it's possible to do updates 
even more quickly and painlessly.  For example, there could be a 
network server available for both interactive lookups and automatic 
queries from HAL.

You _can't_ change the autosuspend setting for a device that hasn't yet
been detected; you can only do it after detection.  But you _can_
modify a whitelist either before or after a device is detected; any
such modifications won't affect the already-existing devices.
Does that answer your question?
