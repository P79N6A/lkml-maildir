Subject: [ANNOUNCE] 2002-08-26 release of hotplug scripts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/8/26/135

I've just packaged up the latest Linux hotplug scripts into a release,
which can be found at:
 	
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17679
Or from your favorite kernel.org mirror at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2002_08-26.tar.gz
I've also packaged up a Red Hat 7.3 based rpm:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2002_08-26-1.noarch.rpm
The source rpm is available if you want to rebuild it for other distros
at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2002_08_26-1.src.rpm
The main web site for the linux-hotplug project can be found at:
	
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net/
which contains lots of documentation on the whole linux-hotplug
process.  There are also links to kernel patches, not currently in the
main kernel tree, that provide hotplug functionality to new subsystems
(like CPU, SCSI, Memory, etc.)
The main changes in this release are the following:
	- fix for USB hotplugging to search /etc/hotplug/usb/*.usermap
Here's the changes (and who made them) from the last release:
    Changes from David Brownell
        - load_drivers(): variables are local, and doesn't try
          usbmodules unless the $DEVICE file exists (it'd fail)
        - update hotplug.8 manpage to mention Max'patch
        - patch from Max Krasnyanskiy, now  usb hotplugging also
          searches /etc/hotplug/usb/*.usermap
   Changes from Fumitoshi UKAI
        - etc/hotplug/hotplug.functions: grep -q redirect to /dev/null 
          closes: debian Bug#145484
thanks,
