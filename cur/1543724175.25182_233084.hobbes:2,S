"atop -mm6" is not what I'd call a self-contained patch. I'm relatively
irritated about the approach to (or perhaps even avoidance of) testing
in isolation going on here. I have other things I very urgently need to
do, and I doubt whatever I get for doing your homework for you will pay
for screwing up public presentations. I have had enough trouble in
general isolating causes of failures, so please prep this properly.
