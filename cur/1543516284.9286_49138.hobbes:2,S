Well, the guy wasn't very bright.  He sent it to an address that didn't
exist, and the list got the bounce message from his relay.
From the headers:
|------------------------- Failed addresses follow:
---------------------|
 <gjmichel@earthlink.net> ... transport smtp: 550
<gjmichel@earthlink.net>... User unknown
|------------------------- Message text follows:
------------------------|
Received: from ---(really [198.142.239.33]) by mailarray.mpx.com.au
        via smtpd with smtp
        id <m11nl4z-000JWeC@mailarray.mpx.com.au>
        for <unknown>; Wed, 17 Nov 1999 03:03:37 +1100
        (/\##/\ Smail3.1.30.13.Y2K #30.35 built 1-mar-01)
The address the relay received it from was 198.142.239.33, which
nslookup says is:
Name:    dialup-mdc23933.mpx.com.au
Address:  198.142.239.33
It's one of their own customers.  Call them and complain. There's
probably some charge you could bring against them, like stealing
computer resources or some such thing, but they're in Australia, so good
luck.
