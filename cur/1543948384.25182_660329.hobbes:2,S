thanks, applied.

i'm wondering, have you seen this happen in practice? We use 
sys_set_thread_area() for every new task started up. I guess we havent 
seen problems in the field yet because this early during startup tasks 
do not normally receive signals? (or if they do they are fatal and no 
user signal context is used.)
btw., gcc 4.2.3 doesnt do it due to CONFIG_FRAME_POINTERS=y here, and 
most distros turn on frame pointers.
btw., this whole thing of us having to notice such tail-optimization 
incidents is totally fragile and unreliable. Shouldnt there be a "dont 
tail-optimize me" attribute which we could stick into asmlinkage? 
Perhaps sparse could detect asmlinkage functions that do not do 
prevent_tail_call()s?
