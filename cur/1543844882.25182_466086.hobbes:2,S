I seem to recall somewhere that it was possible to prevent anonymous  
memory from being mapped PROT_EXEC during or after being mapped  
PROT_WRITE; and that in fact your average SELinux-enabled system had  
such protections for everything but the Java binary and a few other  
odd programs.  If you can't ever execute any data blobs except those  
that came directly from a properly-secured SELinux-enabled filesystem  
it makes exploiting a server significantly harder.
