What could possibly be wrong with this? It's true and it's
also not terribly obvious to a lot of people how much Linux
owes to the FSF, GPL and GNU. 
It's important to note that there's a lot of code out there
that is GPLed but has nothing to do with the FSF, other than
to recognize the origins of the license which makes it all
possible.
RMS may say things at times which inflame people a bit but
I fail to understand the abuse that some people heap upon
him. It's uncalled for. Furrfu, is it that big a deal to
use "GNU/Linux" once out of ten? Is it really going to hurt
you?

Eric
