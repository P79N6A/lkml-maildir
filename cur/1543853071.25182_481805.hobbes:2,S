We already detect PATA over SATA so we can trivially address that (the
knobble check). Similarly we can turn ALPME on using a timer so it kicks
in after long idle periods only, or tie it to laptop mode.
For a laptop type environment with SATA not bridged PATA turning it on is
clearly the right thing to do.
