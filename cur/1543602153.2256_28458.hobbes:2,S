Speaking of ext3 and 2.4.10, do you have an idea when you could
get an updated ext3 patch for 2.4.10? I tried applying the latest
0.9.9 patch to 2.4.10-pre12, fixing the rejections by hand, but
the result was an oops when fsck.ext3 ran on boot.
The biggest problem was with the changes in mm/vmscan.c - I added
try_to_release_page(), and replaced the only call to
try_to_free_buffers() that I found (as the patch did). All the
other rejections were one liners.
I've seen reports of ext3 working with the vmscan.c hunk ignored
- is this a reasonable approach?
Thanks for any assistance,
Simon Fowler
