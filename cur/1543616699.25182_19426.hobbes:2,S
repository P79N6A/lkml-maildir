	Hi,
	I've converted to new drivers to the new driver API for
Wireless Extensions, wavelan_cs and netwave_cs. I've added the
bloat/unbloat number in my comments.
	I've updated all that on my web page :

	If Linus is in a receptive mood, I would like to start feeding
those changes to kernel 2.5.X...
	Have fun...
	Jean
