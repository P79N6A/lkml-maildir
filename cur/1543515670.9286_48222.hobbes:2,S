Wasn't there a consensus that allowing CLONE_PARENT where the
parent hadn't specifically permitted that flag is a security
risk?
The original patch had a CLONE_PPIDOK, though which the parent
could indicate that it was happy to have wait return on a child
that it didn't spawn (or to receive SIGCHLD for one).
Would you accept a patch to put this back?
Matthew.
