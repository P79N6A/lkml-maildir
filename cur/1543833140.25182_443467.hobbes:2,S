this does not have to be a false positive!
It is not legal to take ANY non-hardirq safe lock after having taken a
lock that's used in hardirq context.
(having said that the skb_queue_tail lock needs a  special treatment for
some real false positives; Linus merged that already)

Lets call priv->lock lock A, and the skb_queue_lock lock B to keep this
short
CPU 0			CPU 1
soft irq context	user or softirq context
take lock B
(anywhere in net stack)
			take lock A 
			(ipoib_mcast_send)
interrupt happens
take lock A (spins)
in ISR somewhere
			take lock B (spins)
			(in skb_queue_tail() called from
			ipoib_mcast_send)
Now this assumes your queue is shared with the networking stack,
so that the first "take lock B" on CPU 0 can happen without disabling interrupts.
(as several of the SKB functions do that get used by the networking stack, but not
 the simple ones used by drivers for private queues).
If this queue used in ipoib_mcast_send() is a private queue you probably want to 
apply the patch below (already in/on its way to mainline)
