Hi Paul, Steve,  
This is with reference to the preemptible rcu implementation in
2.6.24-rc5-rt1.
In __rcu_read_unlock(), we call __rcu_preempt_unboost() to unboost a
task's priority which had been bumped up when it was preempted out
while the rcu_read section.
The code path is as follows
__rcu_read_unlock()
	|
	|--> local_irq_restore(oldirq);
	|
	|--> __rcu_preempt_unboost();
		|
		|--> rcu_trace_boost_unboost_called(RCU_BOOST_ME)
where RCU_BOOST_ME is #defined as &__get_cpu_var(rcu_boost_data).
Is calling __get_cpu_var() safe in this context, since we've already
enabled the local interrupts and we're not in a preempt_disabled() ?
Thanks and Regards
gautham.
