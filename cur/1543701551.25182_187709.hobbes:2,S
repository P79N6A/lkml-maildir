People are already doing this for the help entries of the configure process:
http://es.tldp.org/NuLies/web/index.html
 (in Spanish). This is just a patch
over the kernel. The 2.6 split of the configure files will help to coordinate
the efforts, it'd not be very difficult to include it as a "extra" package
in normal distributions. It's not complete of course...
