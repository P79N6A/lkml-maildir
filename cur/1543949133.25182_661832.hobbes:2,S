With slow path I meant the VM. Sorry if that was confusing given locks
also have fast paths (no contention) and slow paths (contention).

Yes. The assembly doesn't worry me at all.

Yes, swapping is I/O bound and it rarely becomes CPU hog in the common
case.
There are corner case workloads (including OOM) where swapping can
become cpu bound (that's also where rwlock helps). But certainly the
speed of fork() and a page fault, is critical for _everyone_, not just
a few workloads and setups.

Yes, that's the only possible worry when converting a spinlock to
mutex.

Sure. That's also why the PT lock switches for >4way compiles. Config
option helps to keep the VM optimal for everyone. Here it is possible
it won't be necessary but I can't be sure given both i_mmap_lock and
anon-vma lock are used in some many places. Some TPC comparison would
be nice before making a default switch IMHO.
