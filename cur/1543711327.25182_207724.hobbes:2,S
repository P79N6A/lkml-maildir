Hi,
I compiled a Device Driver in uni-processor environment. It was working
fine. The same driver code I compiled in SMP environment. Then, it has
given the following errors.
In file included from /usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/irq.h:69,
                 from /usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/hardirq.h:6,
                 from /usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/interrupt.h:45,
                 from tiisr.c:13:
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/hw_irq.h: In function `x86_do_profile':
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/hw_irq.h:202: `current' undeclared (first
use in this function)
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/hw_irq.h:202: (Each undeclared identifier
is reported only once
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/hw_irq.h:202: for each function it
appears in.)
make: *** [tiisr.o] Error 1
Help me in this regard. What can I do to the existing driver code OR
What modifications I have to do in the Makefile.
Thanks in advance.
