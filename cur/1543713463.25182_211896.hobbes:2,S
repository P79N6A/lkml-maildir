You might be able to use the ignore= and force=  parameters to the i2c 
drivers to accomplish this.  With ignore you can prevent a driver from 
scanning an address (specify -1 as the bus to ignore that address on all 
busses) and with force you can specify which bus/address to find the 
specific chip.
I haven't read the code in detail yet, but if force doesn't already 
override ignore, it probably should.  I can't think of reason why you 
would want ignore to override a force directive.
:v)
