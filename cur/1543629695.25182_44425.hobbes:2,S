Well, hope seems justified...

I did, and I failed to reproduce it working on a scratch disk. This was
a period of playing and I /hope/ that it's conclusive. I couldn't get
.12 to reliably fail, though, which is less inspiring.
I should be able to find some time in the next day or so to test it a
bit more on the scratch disk and then, if that works, I will update my
backups. :)
Still, it seems good so far.
