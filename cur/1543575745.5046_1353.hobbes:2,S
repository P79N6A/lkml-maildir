-------
After several months of testing and refinement, the Adaptec 
sponsored aic7xxx driver is now entering Beta testing.  Although
still missing domain validation and the last bits of cardbus
support, there are no known issues with the driver.  I would
encourage all users of card supported by this driver to try the
new code and submit feedback.  Patches for late 2.2.X, 2.3.99
and 2.4.0 are provided in the driver distribution.  For those
of you building the driver as a module, take note that the module
name is now "aic7xxx_mod" rather than "aic7xxx".
As always, the most recent distribution is available here:
