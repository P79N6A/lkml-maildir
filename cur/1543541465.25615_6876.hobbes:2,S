I had proposed adding a CopyFile()-type routine to libc (or perhaps
'libvfs' or some such) to support streams/attributes/forks. Reference my
reply to Tso's concerns about extended attributes -- they should really
be used for only convenience data by programs anyway. Currently, even NT
(the OS with the most generalized named streams support) throws away all
named streams silently when copying to a non-streams-aware FS.

Heh. David Cutler's a pretty smart guy. Overlook 
that whole "win32" debacle and NT's not a bad OS... :)
As Linus said, there's not FS on Linux that currently 
supports named streams, so it's an untestable proposition 
currently. We're developing a cross-platform filesystem 
that does support them. However, we've temporarily 
backported to 2.2.16 in order to get features work 
done w/o having to shoot at a moving target. We will 
be porting back to 2.4 when it settles down a little. 
Perhaps then we can test it?
