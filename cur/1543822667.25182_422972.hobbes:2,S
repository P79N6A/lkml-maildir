There are lots and lots of other things you need to fix to make MPIIX
work with that driver. It has only a single timing register for one so
you must switch timing as you flip drive. Also it is not an IDE class
device so the PCI native/legacy and simplex stuff is not valid. Finally
the PIIX driver pokes several registers it doesn't even have.
What else - oh yes the piix driver doesn't even tune the timings, so it
doesn't work anyway.
Thats why drivers/scsi/pata_mpiix is a separate driver. Really if you
want to try and rescue the old PIIX driver you should split out PIIX3
and MPIIX into their own drivers.
