Regular reclaim also cannot immediately write out pages. Writes are 
usually deferred. If you have too many anonymous pages in regular reclaim 
then you can have the same issues.
The difference is that recursive reclaim does not trigger writeout at 
the moment but we could address that by having a pageout list that then 
starts writes from another context. Then both reclaims would be able to 
trigger writeout.
