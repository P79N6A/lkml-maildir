No. It's NOT GRUB's fault.

Yes. Since you are using 2.4.0 with described bug. GRUB 0.5.94 works
*flawlessly* with 2.2.x kernel but not with 2.4.0. If GRUB 0.5.93
using less correct but more compatible with buggy kernel technique
ans thus works with 2.4.0 it's not proof that kernel do not suffer
from said bug. I'd like more simple test case, though: GRUB is far
to complex program to use it like test case (even if bug is indeed in
kernel).

Oh, yeah.
  - PostreSQL does not work reliable with Linux due to strange kernel behaviour
with sockets while works just fine with HP-UX, Solaris, *BSD and so on.
  - You are wrong - it's not kernel problem at all since MySQL works just fine.
  - Huh ?
What's the difference ?
P.S. BTW what about socket handling. Can ANYONE comment on strange Linux's
behaviour ? When socket is closed by server client will get EPIPE but then
if you'll try to read from socket once more you'll get the rest of data.
Looks like VERY strange logic to me :-/
