	I've found sched_yield to be most useful in a case where you can't afford
to wait for a lock, but your processing will be much more efficient if you
have that lock. So you do this:
bool TryYieldLock(lock *f)
{
 if(TryLock(f)) return true;
 sched_yield();
 return TryLock(f);
}
	And you use it like this:
if(TryYieldLock(f))
{ /* great, we got the lock, just do it */
 DoItNow(x);
 Unlock(f);
}
else
{ /* oh well, we didn't get the lock */
 schedule_thread(DoItLater, f);
}
	In other words, you try a bit harder than the usual 'trylock' function but
not as hard as waiting for the lock. If you don't get the lock, you have to
process it a more expensive way (perhaps scheduling another thread to come
around later and wait for the lock).
	Consider a 'free' function for a custom allocator. If there's contention,
you might be willing to do a sched_yield to free it immediately. But you
really don't want to block while some other thread tries to do some
expensive coalescing, in that case you'd rather schedule another thread to
come around later and free it.
	This is much less useful on an MP machine though. It's unlikely that
'sched_yield()' will give the other thread enough time to release the lock
since odds are it's running on the other CPU.
