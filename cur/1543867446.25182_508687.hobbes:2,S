such devices can do a max of one input or 2 inputs. There are cards
that do 16/32 video inputs, do hardware MPEG4 compression and write to
disk/ stream out through the network interface.
But most such devices have proprietory drivers and have issues working
properly. Got bitten by a bug similarly, recently. The vendor was pig
headed to either fix the driver or to provide driver source.

 They talked too much of Linux, but really
pathetic stuff overall, claimed their issue was Intellectual Property)
They claimed the Linux kernel was buggy rather than stating that their
driver was buggy.
In the end, luckily got my money back for the hardware.
