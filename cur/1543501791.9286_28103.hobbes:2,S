We've done something similar in the Solaris kernel at the syscall and
signal interfaces; the advantage of the kernel approach being that
extensions are forced upon applications.  With libraries, apps can
circumvent extensions by making the syscalls directly, making it hard
to enforce "security" extensions.  This distinction may or may not be
important to you...
Our interposition layer has three properties: Transparency (i.e.: no
interface changes, works with statically linked code, etc.), it's
incremental, and composable.  By incremental, you can extend any
subset of the syscall space, whatever you're interested in.  By
composable, you can have multiple extensions running simultaneously in
a stack.  The sysadm decides on the (sometimes non-trivial) ordering
of the extensions within a stack.  Extensions can act on all threads,
or some subset, and optionally any forked children.
We got a fair bit of experience making the above fast and writing
sample extensions.  Here's the URL of our writeup from USENIX 98:
