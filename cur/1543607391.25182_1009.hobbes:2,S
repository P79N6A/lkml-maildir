Actually if you wish you can use your full 1GB just fine without HIGHMEM:
In /proc/meminfo:
MemTotal:      1025360 kB
LowTotal:      1025360 kB
At boot:
kernel: On node 0 totalpages: 262128
kernel: zone(0): 4096 pages.
kernel: zone(1): 258032 pages.
kernel: zone(2): 0 pages.
The related config parameters:
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is not set
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is not set
# CONFIG_1GB is not set
CONFIG_2GB=y
# CONFIG_3GB is not set
For what I know this trick just limits you on the amount of swap you can
have. The suggestion came from Ingo Molnar and it works fine for me.
