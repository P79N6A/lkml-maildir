Of course it does: it has to.
qeth needs qdio, and qdio hasn't finished init when qeth tries to load.  
Something tries to load qeth again, and this time it works (qdio's init has 
presumably finished).
We fail rather than sleep in the "dependency isn't ready" case.  Partially 
because it's not happened before, but partially because we risk nasty loops.
Cheers,
Rusty.
