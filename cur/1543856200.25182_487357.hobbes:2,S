Jens suparna hello
I have managed to understand why io_submit is sometimes very slow.
It is because the device is plugged once too many io's are being sent.
I have conducted a simple test with nr_request to default value of 128
and and 256.
and it proved to be correct.
I would truely appreciate your comment on this.
