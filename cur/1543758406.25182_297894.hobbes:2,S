Since it is common practice to write code as:
                for(npar = 0 ; npar < NPAR ; npar++)
... it is quite likely that the compiler does a better job with
that code than what you substitute. And, if you did a check
of the code generation, it might be different between different
compiler versions.
This kind of "code optimization" won't optimize anything in
the long-run.
