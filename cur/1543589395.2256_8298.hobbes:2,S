That's proving that the British can spell (it's the Oxford English
Dictionary, after all), and that Andreas Salomon doesn't know standard
English verb morphology.  I rather suspect that there are quite a few
verbs prefixed with "de-" in common use that aren't in dictionaries,
since it's well understood how "de-" changes the meaning of a verb.
