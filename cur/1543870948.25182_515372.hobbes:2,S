Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/3] RFC: using hrtimers for in-kernel timeouts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've played around with the new timer statistics to see which timers might
benefit of being moved from traditional timers to hrtimers.
Since my understanding is that timer_list timers are not really meant to
expire, this seems to include a lot of what comes in through
schedule_timeout, in particular select() and futex wait.
I have no idea if what I was attempting is even the right approach to
start with, but I want to share the patches in case it is ;-).
Maybe someone is interested in running some low-level benchmarks on this
or point out any bugs in the code.
