Hello,
The Ethernet bonding module is useless without ifenslave.c. I'm making a Debian
package for it, and I have tried to find the "offical" distribution of this
small program. I could not find an authorative source, instead a lot of copies
and patched versions are scattered around the Internet (I maintain a patched
version myself too).
I would like to combine all the useful extra features and patches into this
Debian package, so if you know of a patched version or maintain one yourself,
please send it to me.
Thanks,
