The main weakness of JFFS2 (at this kind of size) is that there _is_ no
fs layout -- so there isn't a hard 2GiB or 4GiB limit in the format,
because we never encode offsets anywhere but in memory.
We'll push JFFS2 further than the current 512MiB by enlarging the data
nodes -- so each node covers something like 16KiB of data instead of
only 4KiB, and then there'll be about 1/3 as many of them, which will
cut the memory usage and reduce the amount we need to read in the
"summary" blocks. But logfs is the way forward, I agree.
