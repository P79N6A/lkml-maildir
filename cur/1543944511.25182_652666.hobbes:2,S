Peter, it may sound stupid but I'm honestly not sure what you mean. Please bear
with me I do not mean to sounds arrogant. I'm looking for advice here.
So here are some questions:
- First, who would the regular maintainer be in this case ?
I felt that cpu isolation can just sit in its own tree since it does not seem 
to belong to any existing stuff.
So far people suggested -mm and -shed.
I do not think it has much to do much with the -sched.
-mm seems more general purpose, since Linus did not pull it directly I asked 
Andrew to take this stuff into -mm. He was already ok with the patches when I 
sent original pull request to Linus.
- Is it not easier for a regular maintainer (whoever it turns out to be in this case)
to pull from GIT rather than use patches ?
In any case I did post patches along with pull request. So for example if Andrew 
prefers patches he could take those instead of the git. In fact if you look at my 
email I mentioned that if needed I can repost the patches.
- And last but not least I want to be able to just tell people who want to use CPU 
isolation "Go get get this tree and use it". Git it the best for that.
I can see how pull request to Linus may have been a bit aggressive. But then again
I posted patches (_without_ pull request). Got feedback from You, Paul and couple of 
other guys. Addressed/explained issues/questions. Posted patches again (_without_ 
pull request). Got _zero_ replies even though folks who replied to the first patchset
were replying to other things in the same timeframe. So I figured since I addressed 
everything you guys are happy, why not push it to Linus.
So what did I do wrong ?
