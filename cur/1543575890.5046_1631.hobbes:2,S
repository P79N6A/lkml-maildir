We understand the meaning of EPIPE, the question is why 2.4.x is returning EPIPE,
while 2.2.x is succeeding in sending
the data to thttpd. Using the 2.2.x kernel our proxy functions, and I can access
thttpd directly. In 2.4.x I can access thttpd
directly but the proxy does not function.
 I have already noticed that the 2.4.x kernel does not set errno = 0 in many places
where the 2.2.x kernel did, so there are
differences.
