Subject: [patch -mm 0/7] pid namespace and namespace cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The next serie contains some cleanups on namespaces that have been
lying in our container patchset for a while. The patches seem stable
enough and not too controversial to be good candidates for a -mm merge.
Here's a short summary of what they are doing :
* add a process_session() helper routine
* rename 'struct namespace' to 'struct mnt_namespace' 
* add pid namespace framework to nsproxy but without the unshare
  feature
* add a child_reaper per pid namespace
* add an id to nsproxy for a future syscall bind_ns
A next serie should follow soon, which depends on the above. 
* net namespace framework, empty object without any dependency on
  the layer
* unshare_ns syscall (unshare dedicated to namespaces with its own 
  flags) 
* bind_ns syscall enabling a process to switch nsproxy
* more cleanups for the pid namespace
Pending patches we are still working on :
* layer 3 net namespace providing a simple and fast isolation of
  a net interface
* full pid namespace, this is quite complex.
Thanks,
C.
