Hello!
When I have loaded only ehci, my usb 2.0 devices are attached
as usb 2.0.
If I have loaded ohci and ehci, my usb 2.0 devices are handled by
ohci. 
My question: Why? Shouldn't ohci be the fallback and ehci default?
I have the following usb controllers:
0000:00:0a.0 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxxx UHCI USB
1.1 Controller (rev 50)
0000:00:0a.1 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxxx UHCI USB
1.1 Controller (rev 50)
0000:00:0a.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB 2.0 (rev 51)
0000:00:14.0 USB Controller: ALi Corporation USB 1.1 Controller (rev 03)
One is handled by uhci (for the internal wlan card), 
two are handled by ohci (for external 1.1 devices) and
one is handled by ehci (should be for external 2.0 devices).
Any hint appreciated!
Nico
