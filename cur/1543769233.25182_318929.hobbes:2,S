I was hoping somebody would explain how to get 'dmix' plugin working in the
kernel - then I could get rid of esd ;)  (Note that running something in
userspace that accepts connections, runs dmix on them, and then creates one
thing spewing to /dev/pcm isn't a solution - I've already *got* esd, warts and all)
