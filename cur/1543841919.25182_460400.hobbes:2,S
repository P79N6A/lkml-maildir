At least OS X doesn't complain. I haven't tested Linux-to-Linux yet ---
but that's what Endpoint was obviously written for in the first place,
potentially with multiple 1394 cards on the target and multiple
concurrent initiators. Manish Singh is the author; he will get feedback
from me. I think he was around at linux1394-devel occasionally.
BTW, Endpoint could be reused to build a transport driver for the
upcoming generic SCSI target framework.
