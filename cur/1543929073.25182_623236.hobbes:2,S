That bug is filed against that legacy /dev/rtc driver, not rtc-cmos.
The submitter hasn't tried the rtc-cmos code, but since the issue
currently appears to be related to using the HPET in "legacy mode"
(what I call "broken mode"), I'd expect similar problems would show
up with the rtc-cmos code too.
