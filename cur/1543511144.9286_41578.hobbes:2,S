I implemented it in user-space for our Linux-based firewall, so that when
proxy-ARP was enabled, the ARP caches of other hosts on the LAN would be
advised of the new MAC address.  There is a tacky little demo program that
you can start from at 
http://www.terran.org/~bryan/prog/files/garp.c
 or
also at 
ftp://linux.watchguard.com/pub/watchguard/watchguard/garp.c.
  It
should not be hard to modify the program to then watch for replies and
raise a warning/syslog message about duplicate IP's.
