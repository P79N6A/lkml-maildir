Well, the reservation is already done at mmap time for shared mapping. Why
does kernel need to do anything at fault time?  Doing it at fault time is
an indication of weakness (or brokenness) - you already promised at mmap
time that there will be a page available for faulting.  Why check them
again at fault time?
I don't think your implementation handles PRIVATE mapping either, Isn't it?
Private mapping doesn't enter into the page cache hanging of address_space
pointer, so either way, it is busted.

Yeah, I agree.  It crossed my mind whether I should fix that or post a
fairly straightforward back port.  I decided to do the latter and I got
bitten :-(  That is in the pipeline if people agree that this variable
reservation system is a better one.

I think it is the inode->i_mutex.
