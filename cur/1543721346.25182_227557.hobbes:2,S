Hi, 
I've got few Dell PE750 boxes with P4HT.
Installed Mandrake 10.0 with 2.6.3-smp.
This box have 2 onboard nics:
eth0: 82547GI (8086:1075)
eth1: 82541GI (8086:1076)
When I try to ifup eth0 it crashes kernel, i can't even toggle NumLock,
when i boot with noapic, i can at least toggle NumLock, but nothing
else.
eth1 gets up fine and works perfectly.
I've got suggestions to rebuild kernel without acpi, apm, apic.. will it
help?
Any others ideas?
Thanks..
