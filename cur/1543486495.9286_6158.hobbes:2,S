Reiserfs is actually working.
<br>We are doing our last performance tuning experiments, and are benchmarking
it.

<p>dtfs holds lots of promise mostly because its the closest to actually
<br>working 8) and it is fully compatible with ext2. From what I remember
you
<br>just plug in 'fs personality modules' into dtfs and presto, you have
<br>logging for XYZfs.
<p>Aside from a real LVM (eg growable fs) the lack of a logging FS is the
<br>last big hurdle towards Linux HA. There are lots of smaller hurdles
though

Dump NT! Get Linux (<A HREF="

http://www.kernel.org

&nbsp;(<A HREF="
