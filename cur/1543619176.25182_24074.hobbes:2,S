2.5.3-pre6 gets rid of Documentation/Configure.help and replaces it by
smaller files nearer their use. This seems to have broken the help
facility in menuconfig (and possibly the other configs)
I've generated one at config time using a makefile target like this:
Documentation/Configure.help:
        cat `find -name Config.help` > Documentation/Configure.help
Is this the way that it is intended to work, or should I be making extra
effort to not include the .help for the wrong architecture?
