I am interested in writing a Linux driver for the remote control
interface included on some Hauppauge WinTV video capture cards.
Before I get started I wanted to ask the usual questions.  Does this
already exist (am I just missing something)?  Is someone already working
on this project?  If I start the project tomorrow will someone already
have it finished before I make any progress?
If the previous three questions are answered in the negative, I plan on
investigating the remote control receiver's hardware interface soon.
Hopefully, Hauppauge will provide the device's interface.
