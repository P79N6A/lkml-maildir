This may be the wrong platform for this question, but after reading Rob
Landley's note on performance on Itanium and architecture concerns, I am
interested in Kernel hackers who have had to write code for Itanium's
comments on the same, if you are not bound by NDA's.  Correct me if I am
wrong, but I thought I saw the announcement that Itanium is shipping.  Have
you tested Itanium performance?  We have an preproduction unit with quad
Itanium's.  I have not had time to benchmark against other units, I am
interested in performance items.  Feel free to drop me a line off list if
you can.
