Your guess is correct. If this happen Olivier will see corruption sooner
or later. But this should never happen, unless we have a subtle bug in
iscsi_tcp.c which needs to be verified and fixed.
Since SCSI tape device usually causing a lot of sense data, we probably
have a bug around sense data path processing. And this is not related to
TCP API abuse in anyway. I would recommend to continue this discussion
on www.open-iscsi.org mailing list.
