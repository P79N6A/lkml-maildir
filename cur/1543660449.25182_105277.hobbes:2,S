It was "dbench 100" which led me to investigate and post patch below
a couple of days ago: worth trying again with this patch applied.
But I'm no expert on ext2, and fear there may be lots more wrong:
does look rather as if nobody has been stressing ext2 for a while.
For almost a year (since 2.5.4) ext2_new_block has tended to set err
0 instead of -ENOSPC or -EIO.  This manifested variously (typically
depends on what's stale in ext2_get_block's chain[4] array): sometimes
__brelse free free buffer backtraces, sometimes release_pages oops,
usually generic_make_request beyond end of device messages, followed
by further ext2 errors.
