Hi Nicolas,
I believe this is related to the fact that hibernation uses the hotplug 
subsystem to disable all CPUs except the boot CPU.
Thus guarantee_online_cpus() is called on each cpuset and removes all 
CPUs, except CPU 0, from all cpusets.
I'm not quite sure about if/how this should be fixed in the kernel, 
though. Looks like a very simple user-land workaround would be enough.
	Simon.
