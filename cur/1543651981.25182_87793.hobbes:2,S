In the /prod/PID subset of procfs, why are the exe, cwd, and root symlinks
considered priviledged information?
Exe is the big one for me, as this one can be usually infered from reading
/prod/PID/maps.  Root I guess can't be inferred in any unpriviledged way,
and neither can cwd.  At any rate.. I am not sure behind the philosophy to
make these symlinks' destinations priviledged...  can someone clarify
this?
Thanks,
