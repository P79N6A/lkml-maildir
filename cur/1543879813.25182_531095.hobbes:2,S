We're in agreement! YAY!
Actually this is simpler than that. I'm taking SD out of the picture. It has 
served it's purpose of proving that we need to seriously address all the 
scheduling issues and did more than a half decent job at it. Unfortunately I 
also cannot sit around supporting it forever by myself. My own life is more 
important, so consider SD not even running the race any more.
I'm off to continue maintaining permanent-out-of-tree leisurely code at my own 
pace. What's more is, I think I'll just stick to staircase Gen I version blah 
and shelve SD and try to have fond memories of SD as an intellectual 
prompting exercise only.
