Is there any driver available for the AM79C961 PCNet-ISA+?  The AM79C961
driver seems to only support the PCI version of this chipset.  The card I
have is a 16 Bit ISA card made in 1994 by Microdyne.  It's only got an
RJ-45 port and it has 4 leds, 1 red, 3 green.  The only other info I can
see is ASSY#9800210-00, FAB#5510210-00.

You may think you can fly, but you better not try.
