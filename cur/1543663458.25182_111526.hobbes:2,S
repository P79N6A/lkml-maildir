this is why it would be nice to set a prctl in the task structure that
defines the latency sensitive tasks, so you could leave enabled the CFQ
always and only xmms and mplayer would take advantage of it (unless you
run then with --skip-frame-is-ok). CFQ in function of pid is the simpler
closer transparent approximation of that.
