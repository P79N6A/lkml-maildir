That should work.

Still, I am a bit frustrated. During this weekend I reported 2 regressions 
(wlan and ata)  and I still try to find out why suspend/resume stopped 
working. In the meantime I have identified 2 patches (one was already known, 
I reported the 2nd to the usb maintainers) after 2.6.28 that caused suspend 
to ram regressions. In rc1 S2R was broken again. So I tried bisecting the 
third patch - which finally brought me to the btrfs bisect problem.
For me, this was the most annoying  merge window ever.
In my opinion we should really avoid subtree merges in the future as a curtesy 
to people who do the uncool work of testing, problem tracking and bisecting.
