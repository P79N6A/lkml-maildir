No, because the 2D ddx module is the one doing all the versioning.  It 
doesn't tell the kernel its version number etc., but the ddx module gets 
the version from the kernel, and fails if its the wrong one.  If the 
kernel was the one doing the checking, then your suggestiong would be a 
nice way of handling it.
