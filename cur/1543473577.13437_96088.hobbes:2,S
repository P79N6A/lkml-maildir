That was it.  Up until 2.1.122 I had APM compiled even though I was on
SMP. In my BIOS APM was also enabled.  I guess the kernels actually had
some kind of APM interaction going on even when they say they disabled APM
in SMP.  Once I turned it off in the BIOS, the problem disappeared.
I should have found this one myself.  It's been about 8 or 9 months
since I had to pin any problems down.  Thanks for the help!
