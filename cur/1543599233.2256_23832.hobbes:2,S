The reason it's wrong is because he put #ifdef's in there. The
functions should just be called unconditionally. The #ifdef's are in
the header.

Huh?!? I thought that should be obvious. Think about it,
register_chrdev() registers a *major*, whereas devfs_register()
registers an individual device node. The former has no way of
representing which devices are detected, the latter sets up a 1:1
relationship between devices and device nodes (which is what people
actually want).
