If you add a USB ID to the driver, then you are telling it to communciate to
the device. It doesn't suddenly make the driver compatible with the device.

Looking at the name of the windows driver is indeed usually a good start,
but you don't need to boot to windows to check that. How about looking
at the driver name on the driver CD, or on the support website of the
manufacturer.
