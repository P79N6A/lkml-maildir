Ok a few observations..
Adding that need_resched() in the outer loop utterly destroys the
performance gain for PREEMPT=y. Voluntary preemption is mostly good, but
somewhat unstable results.
Adding that blocking on !owner utterly destroys everything.
Going to look into where that extra preemption comes from.
