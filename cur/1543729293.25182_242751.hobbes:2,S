I'm hopeful that the next release of binutils (any ideas when that'll
be?) should resolve the various problems I've found.
At that point, I think we should consider whether to keep the check
(for possible problems in the future) and/or prevent older ARM
binutils building the kernel.  That depends whether forcing all ARM
people to use the latest and greatest binutils (which may have other
issues) is really the best plan...
