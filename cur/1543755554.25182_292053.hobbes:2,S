That's actually a good question. The patch allows to give several people
access to the same terminal, which sometimes comes in handy with tools
like screen (at least in its current version), and that's what the patch
originally was meant for. I've just talked this over this with one of
the maintainers though, and there are probably better ways than handling
this at the file permission level, like passing open file descriptors
between processes. So unless somebody comes up with a convincing
application, that patch probably should stay out.
Cheers,
