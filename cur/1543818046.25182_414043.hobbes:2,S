One thing that's not at all clear from casual reading of the source code
of either the kernel or the userspace, or most of the existing docs...
The audit facility is *very much* an after-the-fact logging - there are a
few places where the code jumps through very odd hoops to deal with the fact
that by the time an actual notification is generated, the entire process that
triggered the event could be *gone*, completely and totally.
