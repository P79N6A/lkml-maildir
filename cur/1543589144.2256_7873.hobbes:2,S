> Problem :
> install two Linux-system with a shared scsi-bus and storage on that shared
> bus.
> suppose :
> system one : SCSI ID 7
> system two : SCSI ID 6
> shared disk : SCSI ID 4
> 
> By default, you can mount the disk on both system.  This is normal
> behavior, but
> may impose data corruption.
> To prevent this, you can SCSI-reserve a disk on one system.  If the other
> system
> would try to access this device, the system should return an i/o error due
> to the reservation.
> This is a common technique used in
> - Traditional Tru64 Unix ase clustering
> - Tr64 Unix V5 Clustering to accomplish i/o barriers
> - Windows-NT Clusters
> - Steel-eye clustering
> The reservation can be done using a standard tool like scu
> 
> scu -f /dev/sdb
> scu > reserve device
> 
> On Linux, this works fine under Kernel version 2.2.16.

	Questions  :

> - as we are talking about an obsolete routine, how is this accomplished
