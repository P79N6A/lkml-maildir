Subject: [2.6 patch] mark the mcd cdrom driver as BROKEN

The mcd driver drives only very old hardware (some single and double 
speed CD drives that were connected either via the soundcard or a 
special ISA card), and the mcdx driver offers more functionality for the 
same hardware.
My plan is to mark MCD as broken in 2.6.11 and if noone complains 
completely remove this driver some time later.
