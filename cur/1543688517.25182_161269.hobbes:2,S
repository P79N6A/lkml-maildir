I am using it against 2.6.0-test4-mm3-1. I get quite severe music
skipping while scrolling a relatively light website (slashdot) on
Firebird even when there is no other load. I am attaching some of the
numbers I captured during while there was skipping going on. I am also
attaching the script I used to capture the numbers.
A long skip occured during the first few seconds of the test (while
scrolling the website). In the remaining time I opened emacs and then
switched to kghostview (which had been idle for a long time and looked
like it had to be brought out of swap ie.. there was a relatively long
delay before I could use it). The sound did not skip again.
Apart from the above incident, this patch feels better as compared to
O16.3int. 
Keep up the good work..
