The default TCQ depth was 8 in Doug Ledford's aic7xxx driver but was 253
in Justin Gibbs' aic7xxx driver. As seen from driver developpers the TCQ
depth haven't been changed. :-)
The max number of DMA segments and TCQ depths are totally unrelated items.
Your guessed work-around may just indicate that their interaction may
trigger some software bug. Using larger TCQ depths make more pressure on
memory and disk IOs, leading to more memory being locked for IO pending
and memory segmentation being more likely.

The right fix might well not apply to the driver code. Btw, I donnot plan
to look into the problem, as Justin may just be studying it, in my
guessing.  I just wanted to suggest to also look into upper layers and not
to only focus on the low-level driver.
