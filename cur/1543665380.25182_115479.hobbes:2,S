Hi all,
this is the first time I post a patch to the list,
therefore I'm really not sure if it is correct,
even if it is just a 'one line patch'
If I say that my cpu is not a PentiumIV why
he bothers me about "check for P4 thermal throttling interrupt." ?
This patch show that option only if you select that kind of CPU.
Is it correct ? Does it makes sense ?
Ciao,
		Paolo
