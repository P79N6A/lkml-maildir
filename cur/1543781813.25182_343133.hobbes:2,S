This one is really a hard one to ask for. I mean, if we can make it the way
that it will keep knowing that the accel is changing heavily, then it would
be great. This way we/users can implement other actions as well, not only
for HDAPS, but the fact of kicking any other daemon that we want to. i.e.
The theft system, kicking in laptop_mode if there is soft vibration for a
certain amount of seconds, making festival tell you that the PC is being
moved... Anything!
The fact is also that if we would only make a driver for HDAPS, we could
simply make it freeze for 8 seconds and done. How often do you drop the
laptop? How long does it take even if it rolls down the stairs? 4 Seconds
tops? But then, the driver would be boring. ;-)
