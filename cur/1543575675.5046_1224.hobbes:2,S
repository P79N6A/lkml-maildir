-#ifdef MODULE_PARM
 MODULE_PARM(mda_first_vc, "1-255i");
 MODULE_PARM(mda_last_vc,  "1-255i");
-#endif
That was #ifdef MODULE_PARM not #ifdef MODULE. Probably there for 
compatibility with older kernels. Although I'm not sure it's even required 
in 2.2.
And you seem to have forgotten to Cc the maintainer.
