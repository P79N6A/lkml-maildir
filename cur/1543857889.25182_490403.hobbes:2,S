The current situation is...
ata_exec_internal_sg()	: no user except for ata_exec_internal() yet
ata_exec_internal()	: one data transferring user. other are non-data
ata_do_simple_cmd()	: three users
So, adding another exec_internal variant doesn't look so hot.  It seems
we already have enough variants considering the small number of users.
I think it's best to leave it alone for now.
Thanks.
