I assumed this was against 2.2.7. It at least applies, compiles and runs.
Also, I haven't been able to reproduce the bad behaviour again so this
approaches perfection ;) I still have a minor nitpick: the kernel spits
out "eth0: tx interrupt but no status" occasionally. It seems to be
harmless, but makes one think there are still problems with the driver.
Thanks a lot!
