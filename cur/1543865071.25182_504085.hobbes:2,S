Sure, here it is:

That won't go, I'm afraid:
1. Vendor driver doesn't compile for recent kernels. I did compile it,
   but using brute-force approach that is not appropriate for the
   kernel.
2. There is generic driver in the kernel that supports this card among
   others, should I add the ID of this particular card, but doesn't
   support baud rates higher than 115200.
3. Vendor driver is rather close to the generic one being in the kernel,
   so maybe it's better to improve generic one instead of adding yet
   another driver to the tree.
