Subject: [PATCH] fix for idiocy in mount_root cleanups.

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Grr...  OK, that should be a lesson - never do obvious change
just before sending a patch.
	Change in question was s/do_mount/mount/.  Which is almost
the same thing, except for one little detail:  mount(2) in case of
error returns -1 and stores the error in errno.  do_mount(9), OTOH...
IOW, please apply the following and pass me a brown paperbag ;-/
