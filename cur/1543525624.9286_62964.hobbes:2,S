Hello folks,
I'm running kernel 2.2.5 with several copies of dosemu (people use it
by telneting the server). Dosemu uses 4 IPC per session (the limit is
128). So I can only run 32 copies of dosemu simultaneously (I need about
80). If I change this IPC limit to 512, are we going to have other
problems? What's the reason for this limit? and finally in which file of
kernel sources should I change this?
Alan, I really appreciate your help.
THANK YOU.
