Well, it's a boot-loader problem that has to be solved in one
of the boot-loader programs like grub or lilo. When booting a
CD, the BIOS is made to 'think' that a CD is a floppy. It
loads the boot-record and jumps to its code. From that point
on, whatever happens is based upon how, what, and where the
boot record and subsequent code executes. With the large
data space available, you could certainly have multiple
operating systems. It's simply a coding problem. If you
want to modify one of the existing boot-loader programs
let me know. I may be able to help, and certainly can test.
FYI I have a bootable CR/ROM (who doesn't), that contains
a limited root file-system with ramdisks that mount on
/tmp and /var. I use this to boot any linux machine and
repair it. It would be nice to be able to select different
operating system versions as well.
