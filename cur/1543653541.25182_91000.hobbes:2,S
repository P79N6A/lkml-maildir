John,
Running a large application that issues many gettimeofday()
system calls on a kernel running with notsc, results in time
slowing way down.  I've seen the system time advance only 
three minutes over a 30 minute period.  The following program,
executed twice demonstrates the problem.  Three instances running
in parallel made a 16 processor machine completely unusable.
#include <sys/time.h>
main()
{
        struct timeval  tv;
        struct timezone tz;
        while (1) 
                if (gettimeofday(&tv, &tz)) 
                        return;
}
I've recreated on 2.5.30, 2.5.44, and 2.5.47.  Running a system that
is using the tsc I've tried 100 instances of this test running in
parallel with no problems - other than the normal incorrect time due 
to tsc skew.  At least no time slowdowns or hangs.  The system I'm 
using is a 4 node NUMAQ (x86) box.
I assume there is a lock starvation problem happening here, correct?
Any chance of fixing this?
