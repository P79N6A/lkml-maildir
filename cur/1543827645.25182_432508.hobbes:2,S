I'm not sure either :-). Doing some quick statistics on an ARM
platform shows that there are plenty of values (almost 15%) in the
scanned memory that look like pointers (i.e. between 3GB and
3GB+128MB) but do not point to any allocated block:
total scanned values = 932102
total detected pointers = 6270
detected by alias (i.e. in-block address) = 2096
looking like pointer = 135675
I'll add a test to see how many of the look-like pointers actually
point to a valid in-block address. If this is considerable larger than
the detected by alias above, it shouldn't be implemented.

Not exactly. In the above case, Ingo (and me) is worried about having
a incoming pointer (from other block) equal to p->buf and therefore
inside the block allocated with kmalloc. It doesn't matter whether any
value in a block point to locations inside the block since the actual
block first needs to be accessible on the directed graph starting from
the root.
