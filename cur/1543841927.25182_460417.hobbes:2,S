Could this be in any way related to the (in)famous Random Shutdown issues
on a little too many Apple MacBooks?
(since the x60 incidentally just happens to be Core Duo architecture, too)
Those Random Shutdown issues at least in several cases appear to happen
due to trouble with the temperature sensor or mainboard issues.
Thermal management is in quite some trouble there, judging from
the rather diverse aspects of machine shutdown failure...
(fan not working, CPU overheating, NOT overheating but shutting down
directly after boot, ...)
There's nothing like rushing out immature hardware to unsuspecting consumers...
