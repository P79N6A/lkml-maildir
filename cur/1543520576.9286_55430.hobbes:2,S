One question always comes to my mind when I read those security
advisories (especially when they deal with software which has
`security' on its feature list): Why are people using C for project
which explicitly aim at security, although experience has shown that
it is extremly difficult to write secure software in C?  Why don't they
use a programming language in which buffer overflows cannot happen?
