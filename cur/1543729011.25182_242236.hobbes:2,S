Aha!  Indeed I did not.  Thanks for pointing that out.

I followed the model of sys32_rt_sigtimedwait and various compat_*
functions in kernel/compat.c.  In fact, nothing in kernel/compat.c uses
compat_alloc_user_space--and most things in arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c use
the direct stack method as well.  To address your concerns, I imagine all
these places should be changed en masse.

I think it could be merged into group_stop_count.  I just didn't really
want to perturb all that code for the first go-round.  I can make an
attempt at that if all the other potential concerns with the patch are
ironed out.  So far the patch doesn't really touch existing signal code
paths much at all, so it's easier to evaluate.
Thanks,
Roland
