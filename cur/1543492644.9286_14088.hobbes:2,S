I needed to be more explicit - I am talking specifically
about a thread of control created by the kernel_thread
call, which I believe is different from a tread created
by clone.  I shouldn't have used the term "kernel thread"
in my original post, as it is most often used in the
context of the kernel supporting the creation of another
thread of control for a user process - ala clone.  What
I am looking for is information on threads of control
in the kernel that are not associated with a user process.
These, (I think), can be created with kernel_thread.
thanks.
