Okay, I see those "VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for process XXX" errors
as well (2.2.18pre19, uptime 8 days, machine had been idle for hours.
Then, all of a sudden, I get 30 times "VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for
kswapd...", then 15 "VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for xmms...", then
"VM: killing process xmms" and that repeats for ~10 processes including
X.) Never had problems with earlier 2.2.x.
My questions is: I saw Andrea's VM-global patch being recommended as a
solution for this problem, and I already compiled it in (although I
haven't booted into it yet). Should I use Rik's or Andrea's patch?
Is either of them going into 2.2.18?
