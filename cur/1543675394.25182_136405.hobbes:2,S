btw, were you running parallel reads or writes at the same time? (i.e.
launching xterms or ps etc.. in parallel?) I ask because if xterm
startups quick is because the write workload is getting more seeks in
its way.
I'd be very interested if you can measure a bonnie performance change in
contigous reads and writes on a otherwise completely idle machine, the
size of the queue has to be big enough to keep the I/O pipeline full
during contigous writes at full speed.  saying that throughput decrease
alone is not enough to evaluate the reason of this drop.
you can also try with:
	echo 20 500 0 0 500 3000 30 10 >/proc/sys/vm/bdflush
just in case.
