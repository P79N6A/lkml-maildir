I believe I wasn't awake when I typed that mail ;p
The problem is that if you try to set an IP using DHCP (in my case ISC dhcpcd  
version 1.3.22pl4) without first enabling your interface, you get a fatal 
interrupt.
If you enable your interface, then do a dhcp request, it works.
Why I got mixed up with the ap setting is that I first thought that was the 
problem (since iwconfig eth1 showed 00:00:00:00:00:00 instead of the mac 
address of the AP. It was shown in /proc/iwp2100/eth1/bssconfig though)

Yup, I'm compiling that one (together with 2.6.4) right now.
Maybe this should be cc-ed to the devel mailing list too?
