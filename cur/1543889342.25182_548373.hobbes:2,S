Ok, this patch also works.  We still need to enable mmconfig space for 
PCIe and extended config space, but we can continue to use type 1 
accesses for legacy PCI config space cycles to avoid decode trouble 
with mmconfig based BAR sizing.
Assuming Robert's and my patches to enable mmconfig space go in, we'd 
want a similar patch to the i386 mmconfig code.
