I doubt the .config you posted was the one you used, because there were
no KGDB options specified at all.
If you want to be using your vga device as the console that is ok. You
can still activate the sysrq with running the command: echo g >
/proc/sysrq-trigger
You might consider doing "set debug remote 1" in the gdb session if you
want to see what is going on. After the continue, the next time you
break in with the debugger it should send $T.........etc which is a stop
packet.
