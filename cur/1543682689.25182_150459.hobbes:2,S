Best of all: How big you make the number, doesn't matter: You can
always guess such numbers as a local attacker. If not now, then
in some years (want to recompile all existing applications then?).
cmsg(SCM_RIGHTS) is the much better solution, if you really have
processes, which are neither a sibling nor a parent/child
relationship.
And it's also ugly enough ;-)
