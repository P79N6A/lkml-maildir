more accurate accounting of scheduling and interrupt time might be 
considered (especially since we already timestamp in the scheduler, so 
those codepaths could be merged) - but per-syscall accounting of system 
time and user time is pretty much out of the question, it's a way to hot 
codepath as your own measurements show:

but everything will depend on the quality of the actual patches 
themselves - the quality requirements are pretty strict for the affected 
codepaths.
