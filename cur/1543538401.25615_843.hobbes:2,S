What a big question ... it's rated immediately after "who killed JFK ?" ;)
I can say You how I've learned this topic, that is, take a network driver
( at my times I was started with ne2000 ), look at where packets are pushed
in,
then look ( == grep into sources ) at who pop out such data and where it
push in
new ones, and so on.
It's a long path I know, but it worked for me.
