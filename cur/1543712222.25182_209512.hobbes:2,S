Changelog
Additions:
+ Staircase scheduler - my complete scheduler policy rewrite for interactivity 
built on top of the current O(1) scheduler
+ CD audio DMA
+ Grsec (optional only in experimental dir as it breaks compile if disabled)
Changes:
~New batch scheduling (idle scheduling) policy from scratch based on new 
scheduler is much simpler and less prone to system starvation issues
~New isochronous scheduling (low latency, non real time scheduling for 
non-privileged users)
~Updated sched_domains
~Updated bootsplash v3.1.4
~Updated reiser4 snapshot (2004.03.25)
Unchanged:
Autoregulated vm swappiness
Supermount-NG v 2.0.4
CFQ I/O scheduler with I/O priority support.
This is my parting gesture as I'll be on extended leave from 31st March till 
the end of May.
