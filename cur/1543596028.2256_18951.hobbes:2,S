I like to see boot messages which give me info about
my
pc: cpu -- type, speed, cache; motherboard -- type,
cache; busses; cards information (not copyright).
when I want too see what has a computer inside without
opening it i boot a linux kernel, and if i have linux
on it a 'cat /proc/pci' is sufficient for an average 
computer. This is one thing you don't see on
windblows.
I wouldn't like a UN*X which wouldn't tell me what is
he doing.(I don't like fancy GUI's which hide the
sistem from the user and then screw up everything).
