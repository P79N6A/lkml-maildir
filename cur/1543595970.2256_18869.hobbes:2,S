Hello
We've installed reiserfs on a logical volume, consisting of 2 60GB hard
drives, and exported it over NFS. Kernel 2.4.6-pre3. In the beginning
everything seemed to be fine. But then a few strange things have happened:
1. I tried running a program on a host, importing the filesystem in
question, and sending its output to it.  The program uses fwrite function,
and checks the number of items written, so, it didn't match. On the second
run yet another (similar writing)  problem occured, but since then this
program has been running for a few hours already without any noticeable
errors. The remote host is Solaris-2.7 on a Sparc.
2. Another strangeness - this filesystem is also mounted on yet another
Linux machine, running 2.4.5. Actually, the situation is slightly more
complicated: on host a we've got 2 logical volumes with reiserfs: a1 and
a2, mounted in /mnt/lvm/a1 and /mnt/lvm/a2.  And the whole directory
/mnt/lvm is exported over NFS. So, when on a remote host you do df -k on
that mounted filesystem, all 3 values (total, occupied, free) are wrong.
3. All (except ext2, which is used for /) filesystems are compiled as
modules. reiserfs is loaded on boot, when lvols are mounted. I tried
mounting a fat-diskette, and got the following mesage:
read_old_super_block: try to find super block in old location
read_old_super_block: can't find a reiserfs filesystem on dev 02:00.
If all the problems, mentioned above are known and have known solutions
(patches, etc, however, I checked the reiserfs ftp-site - no patches for
2.4.6 yet), please let me know. Shall I use an earlier kernel version? If
they are new, I'll gladly provide any necessary additional information.
