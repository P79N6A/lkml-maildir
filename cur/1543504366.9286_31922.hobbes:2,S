Hello
I have recently upgraded my standard RedHat6.0
distribution (2.2.5-15) to kernel 2.2.10ac12.
I am now unable to access my CD-ROM. It is an
IDE/ATAPI device and is recognised successfully by
Linux, but trying to mount the CDROM, results in a
'bad inode' error.
Details are as follows:
Hardware: PII350, Intel T440BX MoBo, SAMSUNG
CD-ROM SCR-3231, ATAPI CDROM drive  (hdb)
in compiling the kernel, the following config
options were set:
#
# Block devices
#
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDETAPE is not set
...
#
# Filesystems
#
# CONFIG_QUOTA is not set
CONFIG_AUTOFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_ADFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_AFFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_HFS_FS is not set
CONFIG_FAT_FS=m
CONFIG_MSDOS_FS=m
CONFIG_UMSDOS_FS=m
CONFIG_VFAT_FS=m
CONFIG_ISO9660_FS=m
CONFIG_JOLIET=y
# CONFIG_MINIX_FS is not set
CONFIG_NTFS_FS=m
/etc/fstab:
------
...
/dev/fd0                /mnt/floppy
ext2    noauto          0 0
/dev/cdrom              /mnt/cdrom
iso9660 user,noauto,ro 0 0
...
on typing:"mount /dev/cdrom" the following appears
in /var/log/messages:
Jul 28 16:26:18 gollach1 kernel: hdb: command
error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error
}
Jul 28 16:26:18 gollach1 kernel: hdb: command
error: error=0x50
Jul 28 16:26:18 gollach1 kernel: end_request: I/O
error, dev 03:40 (hdb), sector 108
Jul 28 16:26:18 gollach1 kernel: ISOFS: unable to
read i-node block
Jul 28 16:26:18 gollach1 kernel: isofs_read_super:
root inode not initialized
Jul 28 16:26:19 gollach1 kernel: ATAPI device hdb:
Jul 28 16:26:19 gollach1 kernel:   Error: Illegal
request -- (Sense key=0x05)
Jul 28 16:26:19 gollach1 kernel:   Illegal mode
for this track or incompatible medium --
(asc=0x64, ascq=0x00)
While the console reports the standard:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock
on /dev/cdrom, or too many mounted file systems
I am able to mount /dev/fd0, and am also able to
mount all CDs when I boot into kernel2.2.5-15.
Is this a known bug, or have I made an error in my
kernel configuration?
Thanks for any assistance
Mark
