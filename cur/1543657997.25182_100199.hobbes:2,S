What options (int make xconfig) do I have to enable to get the i2c-via
and i2c-viapro modules to build .  I realized that the kernels and
modules that Redhat provided included these two modules, but when I
built a 2.4.20 kernel (downloaded from kernel.org) those modules were
not built.  I chose support for i2c as a module and the i2c-proc and
i2c-core modules were built just fine.  What am I missing?
