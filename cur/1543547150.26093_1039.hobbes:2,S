This will be a speedup for 486 and older 586. I don't have
Intel's optimization manual for 586s handy so i can't argue.
But looking at linux/arch/i386/config.in shows that 486
strings (CONFIG_X86_USE_STRING_486) are preferred for 486,
586, 586 with TSC and 586 MMX.
If you're right this should be changed and we have to use
these routines only for 486 and older 586 machines. Kernels
optimized in this way are slightly smaller.
Anyway, i would like to hear something about the stability of
the new code.
best,
Petkan
