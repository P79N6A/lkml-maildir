Yes, but in the meantime, the CPU will be stuck taking the same irq for
ever without ever going through note_interrupt().

Hrm... yah, it should... still, I find that a bit fragile.

Well, we have a "funny" case with some pSeries... the firmware may
enable interrupts behind our back, and expects us to call a firmware
"try to handle that interrupt" kind of call when we get one we don't
handle. That is, either all the handlers returned IRQ_NONE or there is
no action. I'm not sure how to do that with the current code without
having our own __do_IRQ() which I'd rather avoid...
Ben.
