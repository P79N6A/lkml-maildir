I have simply stated that (1) the problem boils down to what is
derived work and what is no and (2) the developers use the
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL as a hint of what they think to be derived work (not
necessarily tested in court). The _logical conclusion_ of these two
simple facts is, of course, to _not use_ functions marked as
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL unless you're willing to test your belief in court.
Now I see you really want to argue about this but could you please do
it on some other list than the LKML? We use this list for real work
too, you know, and right now you're only contributing noise. Thanks!
