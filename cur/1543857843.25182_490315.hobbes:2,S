Last week we did some more testing with the following result:
We could not reproduce the data corruption anymore if we boot the machines 
with the kernel parameter "iommu=soft" i.e. if we use software bounce 
buffering instead of the hw-iommu. (As mentioned before, booting with 
mem=2g works fine, too, because this disables the iommu altogether.)
I.e. on these systems the data corruption only happens if the hw-iommu 
(PCI-GART) of the Opteron CPUs is in use.
Christoph, Erik, Chris: I would appreciate if you would test and hopefully 
confirm this workaround, too.
Best regards,
Karsten
