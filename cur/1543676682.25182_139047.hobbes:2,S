	This is just bad philosophy. You might as well argue that a canvas that's
been randomly pissed on is just as much art as the Mona Lisa. In fact, it's
a worse argument than that because coding styles aim at objective,
measurable goals. Why does consent matter? If some imbecile wants to argue
that it's good to write code that's hard to understand and debug, why should
we care what he has to say? The consent of people whose opinions are
nonsensical is of no value to people who are trying to create rules that
meet their objective requirements.
	Coding styles aim at specific measurable goals. Code should be easy to
understand, extend, and debug. If someone argues code should be hard to
understand, maintain, and debug, we just ignore him. We don't care if he
agrees with us or not because his opinion is obviously (and objectively) of
no value.
	We can measure, for different coding style, how long it takes to find a
bug. We can measure how long it takes a new programmer to get to the point
that he can contribute to the existing code.
	Coding styles are engineering rules. We can validate them based upon the
results they produce. Objective, measureable results.
