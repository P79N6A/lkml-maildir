Yes, that's intentional.  I fixed the problem in AHCI by copying code 
from libata-core's ata_qc_timeout(), similar to what you did.  Didn't 
like that solution at all, so I started over from scratch.

We'll see how things shake out in the future.
One of the reasons I haven't responded to your ATA exceptions doc RFC is 
that I don't like to plan.  Linux isn't about roadmaps, it's about 
what's the next-best-step.  I think my current EH fixes are the next 
best step, as it cleans up the error handler a lot, and gets things 
working.  Next step after that?  No idea.  I just go on gut feeling I 
have based on direction.
The current feeling is that we should move away from complex 
dependencies on the SCSI EH layer, and do all our own error handling 
(perhaps in ata_wq).  This will allow use of libata as a block driver.

TUR fails for me, too.  It triggers the EH code, which is why I wound up 
needing to fix it :)
Have you dumped the D2H FIS returned by the drive, when the TUR fails? 
What does it look like?  What does the D2H FIS look like after REQUEST 
SENSE?
I bet there is some "clear error" actions we need to take on sil24, 
before it work there.
