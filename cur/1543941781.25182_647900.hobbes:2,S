Applications as in "anything that calls submit_bio()". i.e, direct I/O,
filesystems, etc. i.e. not userspace but in-kernel applications.
In XFS, simultaneous io completion on multiple CPUs can contribute greatly to
contention of global structures in XFS. By controlling where completions are
delivered, we can greatly reduce this contention, especially on large,
mulitpathed devices that deliver interrupts to multiple CPUs that may be far
distant from each other.  We have all the state and intelligence necessary
to control this sort policy decision effectively.....
Cheers,
Dave.
