No, 16373 must fail: After adding 12 bytes the object size would be 
16385, which would mean an order==3 allocation.
And 16372 must succeed: 16384 is still an order==2 allocation.
The idea is that there shouldn't be an allocation order increase due to 
redzoning, and afaics that doesn't happen, except between 4082 and 4095 
bytes.
