I guess no functional purpose at this stage. But I do like this
scheme better anyway, because it means that locked API users are
never exposed to the direct/indirect bit.
It's a bit variable... on powerpc, it _removed_ 22 bytes, and if
I delete the extra BUG_ON that I introduced, then it removes 128
bytes.
