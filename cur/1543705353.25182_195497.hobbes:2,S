Sorry, no.  Don't be misled by the name, swap_out() is used to free
all kinds of mapped pages, not just those which would end up on swap.
Your patch just disables freeing mapped pages under memory pressure.
You could try the untested patch below to swap_out_vma(), but I don't
really recommend it: it still skips freeing up a less common category
of clean pages, just when you'd most like to free them.
