For some reason, this doesn't apply on top of your patches:
Applying patch sysfs-implement-sysfs_dirent-active-reference-and-immediate-disconnect.patch
patching file fs/sysfs/dir.c
patching file fs/sysfs/sysfs.h
patching file fs/sysfs/bin.c
patching file fs/sysfs/file.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 96 (offset 8 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 107 (offset 8 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 240 (offset 8 lines).
Hunk #4 FAILED at 300.
Hunk #5 succeeded at 336 (offset 14 lines).
Hunk #6 succeeded at 368 (offset 14 lines).
Hunk #7 succeeded at 435 (offset 14 lines).
1 out of 7 hunks FAILED -- rejects in file fs/sysfs/file.c
patching file fs/sysfs/inode.c
So I'll only apply the first 11 for now.  Can you respin the last 3 and
send them to me again?
thanks,
greg k-h
