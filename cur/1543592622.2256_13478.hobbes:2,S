You were right, corrupted pointer.
It was due to general memory corruption caused by RAM problems, sorry, it
happened just as I switched to 2.4.5 and I blamed it, it probably started
failing now, after months without any problem, because of the high
temperatures we are having this days.
Thanks for your help and sorry to have disturbed you all for not making a
memtest before :-(
