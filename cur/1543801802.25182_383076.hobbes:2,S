What is the latency in typical "most sound card" case?

Yep; but spindown takes 5 seconds, so if you need to reset ide bus or
not to get it back is driver detail. Plus notice how power consuption
in sleep and suspend is almost same; motor not running is big deal
there. Ouch and hdparm already handles these.

...so "bus provides list of states" ideas do not really work.

Excatly, so "on"/"off" is enough for them.

Processors are handled specially, anyway.
