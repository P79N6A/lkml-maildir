The child's fds are separate, though. The parent can close
its fds without affecting the child's and the child can close
its fds without affecting the parent. Given that, suppose that
the fds related to a terminal. If the child changed the terminal
attributes, this would certainly affect the parent's terminal
since they are the same. It is possible that epoll handles
these attributes the same way and it is likely that such
behavior is "undefined". A fix may be for the child to dup()
the fds and set up its own epoll_ctl using them. If the epoll
relates to a controlling terminal, it is possible that if the
child executes setsid(), becomes its own session leader, then
the epoll  problem will go away because the parent's controlling
terminal and the child's controlling terminal become divorced.
