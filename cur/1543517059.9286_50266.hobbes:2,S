[Either my test program is completely buggy, or ]
We definitively need the memory barrier during set_current_state():
I've attached a samle program that mimics __wait_inode(), and it always
locks up with the normal "mov" and the correct delay between the wake-up
and the sleep functions.
[it should automagically find a suitable delay, if not, then increase
delay2]
Tested with Dual Pentium II/350.
