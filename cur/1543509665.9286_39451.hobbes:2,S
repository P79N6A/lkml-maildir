Is that correct? The Lucent chipset I have seen has a real DSP, but no
microcontroller (perhaps there is another Lucent chipset than the one I have
seen). Surely the V34 and V90 part exists, and all that is needed is the
V42bis part? That should be far easier to do, but it means working out how to
interact with the software in the DSP.
I don't think a free V90 is possible, because of IP issues, and I seem to
remember there are some IP issues with V34 too. Even V42bis had IP problems
with the compression technique, but I think something has been resolved
there. As usual the toughest engineering problems have law degrees.
