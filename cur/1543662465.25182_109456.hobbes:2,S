The basic trick is that  -Wl,--wrap,foo  renames the symbol "foo"
to "__real_foo", and resolves any reference to "foo" to "__wrap_foo".
So you can write wrappers that look like this:
whatever __wrap_foo(...)
{
    /* do stuff */
    blah = __real_foo(...);
    /* do more stuff */
}
While this sounds pretty cool, it comes with a few gotchas:
 - doesn't work for symbols that get resolved at compile time
   (static, maybe also anything in the same compilation unit)
 - when doing incremental linking, you need the -Wl,--wrap there,
   too
 - changing the set of -Wl,--wrap options means that you have to
   rebuild from a make clean afterwards (okay, not such a nightmare
   anymore, thanks to ccache)
I've used this pretty extensively in umlsim. It's okay if you
really want to avoid touching the source underneath. But you
spend a lot of time tracking down the occasional symbol that is
affected by one of the gotchas above ...
