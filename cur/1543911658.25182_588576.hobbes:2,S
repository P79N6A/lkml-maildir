Yeah, it does, I am not a big expert in USB storage, and I haven't seen 
many USB sticks, but I might imagine how windows turns the LED off on 
unmount. Try "eject /dev/sdX", where sdX is your USB storage, after you 
unmount it. Be careful, especially if you have SATA (or SCSI) discs in 
your system or if you use libata for PATA discs not to eject the wrong 
one... For example, if you think you have to eject /dev/sdc, check before 
ejecting it with "mount" if there are any /dev/sdc* partitions mounted.
As for LED going on only when mounting, don't know. Maybe they also issue 
eject after initial enumeration? In which case the LED would go shortly on 
on plug in, then off, then on again on mount. You can try it under Linux 
too, if you issue eject after plugging in but before mount. I think, you 
won't be able to mount it directly after ejecting, you'd have to force 
re-enumeration under Linux.
Thanks
