Hi all
I'm just started this workshop about testing Tux on Compaq hardware, and
the first thing that happens is that I can't start tux. I hope someone can
help me here, so I can get some testing done... Please...
I'm running linux 2.4.13 with the tux2-full-2.4.13-B0.bz2. When trying to
start tux with the init script in tux 2.1.0, I get the following error
(from dmesg):
TUX: logger thread started.
TUX: thread 0 listens on 
http://0.0.0.0:80
.
TUX: could not start worker thread 1.
Once it actually worked, but after the next reboot, it all fucked up. And
- yes - I did use the same versions of everything.
Thanks for all help
