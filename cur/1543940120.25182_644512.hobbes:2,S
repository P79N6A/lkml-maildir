The core issue is that the system clock driving the baud rate generator
is no longer running fast enough to let the UART run.  (In "standby" the
clock is still driven by the PLL, so this issue doesn't come up.)  The
GPIO logic can catch the START bit though ... this technique is used on
some OMAP boards too.  
Agreed that knowing exactly which pin(s) should be remuxed (UARTn.RX to
GPIO in suspend then enabling it as a wakeup irq, then reversing that
on resume; maybe UARTn.DCD should work too..), and how (as A-peripheral?
or  B?) is chip-specific knowledge.  Such a function pointer could work.
What will AVR32 (AP7) need to do, when it supports system sleep states?
