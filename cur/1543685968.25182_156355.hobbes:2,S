Dr.Cowles.J Fox, he was 
involved in a plane crash during his business navigation from Canada to 
Australia. He left no

finance company in 
Overseas where we agreed that the beneficiary, next of kin would come 
for the 
clearance within a period of one month. In view of this, we would like

favour and the 
necessary documents would be sent to you to facilitate the easy 
clearance of the funds. 
All hands are on deck and the project will take seven working days.

you, while the 
remaining 70% will go for other participating team. In order to know 
you better, 
we would like you to fill the below form and send it to me by way of

A lawyer will be recommended for you here in London England, as a 
trusted Lawyer, 
who will help you secure the legal documentations to effect the claim 
of these funds, 
he would authorise and name you as the beneficiary of the funds.

your capability and responsibility of handling these funds is the most 
considering 
requirement for this transaction. 
Be sure your information would not be divulged to a third party, if for

you decided not to accept this mutually benefiting proposal I am 
offering you 
today, please do confirm, so as to enable me seek assistance elsewhere, 
believe me,

your decision.
