Yesterday I answered someone else with a similar oops:
The code
int ide_xlate_1024 (struct block_device *bdev, ...) {
        ide_drive_t *drive = bdev->bd_disk->private_data;
is just broken - there is no guarantee that bdev is an IDE disk, 
and casting some private pointer to ide_drive_t and then
accessing fields must be unhealthy.
Try replacing the body of ide_xlate_1024 by just
        return 0;
