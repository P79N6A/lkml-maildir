What if I want some users access to /dev/sda4 (happens to be a Zip drive),
but not to all disks? What if I want some users to access /dev/fd0, but a
possibly disjoint set from the above? This is real, not a stupid choice,
and it needs persistence. No defaults will do (on my other machine
/dev/sda4 is /usr).
