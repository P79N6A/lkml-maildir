That's appropriate; after all, as a programming interface, it's
appropriate that there be multiple implementations!  Presumably
that doc is missing, but the API calls _should_ make sense on
their own.

I'd at most expect you're missing an #include <asm-generic/gpio.h>
for the cansleep variants ... which only got added because folk
agreed such spinlock-unsafe calls were needed, not because anyone
had a pressing near-term need for them.  (Unlike the spinlock-safe
functionality, which is _very_ widely implemented.)

Heh, maybe I can even try it out by then.  ;)
