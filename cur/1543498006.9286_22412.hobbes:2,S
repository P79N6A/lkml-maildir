Hello world...
The subject says it all. I was grokking through the isofs stuff and saw
a "naked" kmalloc() in isofs_find_entry(). I don't think it's too
dangerous, since I couldn't cross that particular path in testing with a
number of CDs.
Also, its 'priority' is GFP_KERNEL, which indicates it may block to get
memory. (Is that correct?) Which begs the question... How likely is a
GFP_KERNEL
kmalloc to fail? 
As you might guess I'm a kernel newbie. Below, I've attached a patch
which handles a failed allocation in a manner consistent with the rest
of isofs_find_entry() -> break out of the loop and return below... The
patch is against 2.3.5 (I've been trying to keep up with the
Joneses...), but I believe the problem is in 2.2.x as well.
Anyhow, like I said, I don't think its terribly dangerous. And I
couldn't hit that code to test it. I think the fix is right.
BTW, feel free to ignore the first part of the patch ;) It's just a
reflection of certain anal tendencies that fortunately only manifest
themselves when I program.
I didn't see anyone in the MAINTAINERS list, but I did CC
james@bpgc.com, since his address appeared in a comment mentioning the
kmalloc.
I've also been playing in isofs/dir.c. I saw the "should _really_ be
cleaned up" comment above do_isofs_readdir() and though what a good way
to start playing with the kernel. I'll probably have something
presentable
this week, if I don't get distracted. Nothing too stunning for the linux
gods that dwell here, but we gotta start somewhere.
Please CC me if you have any response. I subscribe to
linux-kernel-digest, but would appreciate a direct email response as
well. Thanks.
