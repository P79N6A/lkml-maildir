I know you don't see it that way, but I still find it bizarre that
"the right to modify the software" should be construed as "implies the
right to modify the device that the software was shipped in".
I do agree that it's not a change in "spirit" - I'm sure the GPL
authors would have disliked TiVoization 15 years ago as much as they
do today, if they had thought about it (regardless of the Stallman
interview where he said he didn't care very much about devices).
However, whether it is a change "in spirit" or not, it clearly is a
qualitative change that substantially changes the rights granted under
the license and it's perfectly reasonable for some authors who liked
the GPLv2 to dislike and reject GPLv3.
