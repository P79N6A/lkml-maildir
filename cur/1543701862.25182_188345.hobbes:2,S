could you please summarize which ones? i upgraded modutils and modified
rc.sysinit for usb support. the rest works unmodified (except NVIDIA
proprietary kernel driver which does not have 2.6.x support yet, but XFree86
driver works fine for me) as far as i can tell. i got exactly 0 (zero)
kernel panics up to now. compared with 2.4.0 few years ago, 2.6.0 works
like charm
