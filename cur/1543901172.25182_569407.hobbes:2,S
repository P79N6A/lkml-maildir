Actually, what is even more weird is that my system is configured to
output the segfaults, i.e. a small user-space program that does a memory
read of *(char*)NULL causes:
[ 1413.164212] null[3740]: segfault at 00000000 eip 0804836a esp
bffde2c0 error 4
But there is no message for the __copy_from_user_ll fault, so I wonder
1 - has the process been killed ?
2 - Is it just the printk that is missing ?
