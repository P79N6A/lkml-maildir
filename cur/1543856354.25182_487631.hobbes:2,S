just as I do : check for the maintainer in the files themselves, or in
the MAINTAINERS file. As a rule of thumb, if a file has not changed in
the last 3 years and its maintainer is not one of the active ones you
regularly see posting on LKML, then there are great chances that the
file is unmaintained. In this case, you might find the new maintainer
in the 2.6 port of the same file/driver. Same if the maintainer's
address bounces.

generally, the core subsystems (network, filesystems, archs, ...) are
still well maintained by people who *really want* to validate the
patches before forwarding them upstream.

Yes, when you can identify them without too much difficulty. For all
network drivers, please send to Jeff Garzik and netdev@vger.kernel.org.
For the rest of the network stuff, use Davem and netdev. Send to Al Viro
for FS. Davem for arch/sparc*, Russell King for arch/arm, Ralf Baechle
for arch/mips*, Paul Mackerras for arch/ppc*, etc... If you find a list
address in the MAINTAINERS file, please CC it too. They're all busy,
so make the question simple enough so that they can quickly reply with
ACK/NACK/QUEUED. Keep me CCed so that you don't have to forward me the
response. Generally, they will reply within one week.
It might seem a bit complicated and heavy, but it's the only way to
get a continued quality support on the whole code.

If there's no easily identifiable maintainer anymore, or if some
maintainers don't reply, then it becomes my job.

No, not at all. We're not doing administrative and repetitive tasks,
and we can still dig through the list archives for a missing patch :-)
Don't waste your time doing this.
Thanks,
Willy
