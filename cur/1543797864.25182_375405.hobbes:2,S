This will BREAK a lot of out-of-tree stuff if merged.
So please figure out some way to hang a HUGE banner out there
so that the external codebases know they need updating.
The simplest way would be to NOT re-use the up()/down() symbols,
but rather to either keep them as-is (counting semaphores),
or delete them entirely (so that external code *knows* of the change).
Cheers
