I cannot see anymore since it's our main production server, so I switched
back at once. Sorry about that. Anyway, both network traffic and disk traffic
was very low.
The problem is not related to the Linux machine beeing slow because the network
exchange was very fast with other gigabit with flow control connected machines.
The problem seems to me to be related to the way the TCP layer is handling small
troubles (probably lost packets on the Mac side because the Linux machine is
gigabit connected to the switch, with flow control enabled, and the Mac is
100 Mbps connected, full duplex, but without flow control).
Please notice that the Linux machine is the client, and is pushing files to
the Mac, which is quite unusual. If the Mac was the client pulling files from
the PC, I bet things might be very different.
