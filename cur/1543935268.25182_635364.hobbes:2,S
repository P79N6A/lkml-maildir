I was wondering about that.  Will you always use GB pages, or will there 
be two classes of huge pages, or will it be a runtime/compiletime config?

They're only used by 64-bit at the moment, aren't they?  Or are you 
suggesting 32-bit could use them too?  There's no corresponding 
definitions on the 32-bit side at the moment.

It's use is 64-bit specific though, isn't it?

Hm, OK.  I thought different 64-bit implementations might have different 
sized physical address spaces or something.
