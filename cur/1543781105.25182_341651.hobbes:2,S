Subject: [patch 37/39] remap_file_pages protection support: wrong "historical" code for review - 1

This "fast-path" was contained in the original
remap-file-pages-prot-2.6.4-rc1-mm1-A1.patch from Ingo Molnar*; I think this
code is wrong, but I'm sending it for review anyway, because I'm unsure (and
in fact, in the end I found the reason for this).
What I think is that this patch (done only for filemap_populate, not for
shmem_populate) calls zap_page_range() when installing mappings with PROT_NONE
protection. The purpose is to avoid an useless page lookup; but the PTE's will
be simply marked as absent, not as _PAGE_NONE. So, with this fastpath, pages
would be remapped again in their "default" position.
In this case, probably a possible fix is to add yet another param in
"zap_details" to mark all PTE's as PROT_NONE ones. Using
details->nonlinear_vma has the inconvenient of using
details->{first,last}_index and of leaving file entries unchanged.
