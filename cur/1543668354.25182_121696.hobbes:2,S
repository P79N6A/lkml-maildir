Interesting.
Yes, I expect that you could fix that up by altering dirty_background_ratio
and dirty_expire_centisecs.
The problem with fsync() is that it waits on the writeout.  You don't want
that to happen - you just want to tell the kernel "I won't be overwriting or
deleting this data".  Make the kernel queue up and start the IO but not wait
on its completion.
It is quite appropriate to do this in fadvise(FADV_DONTNEED) - as a
lower-latency fsync().  The app would need to call it once per second or so. 
It would also throw away any written-back pagecache inside your (start, len)
which is exactly what your applications wants to happen, so the app should be
calling fadvise _anyway_.
What do you think?
