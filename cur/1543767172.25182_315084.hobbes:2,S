Suparna,
I touch tested your patch earlier and seems to work fine. Lets integrate
Mingming's getblocks() patches with this and see if we get any benifit
from the whole effort.
BTW,  is it the plan to remove repeated calls to getblocks() and work
with whatever getblocks() returned ? Or do you find the its better to
repeatedly do getblocks() in a loop till you satisfy all the pages
in the list (as long as blocks are contiguous) ?
Thanks,
Badari
