Hello,
We have a cluster with around 200 nodes, and all of them are installed
with CentOS 5.2/2.6.18-92.el5 kernel.
And we found many dmesg log as follows:
 | TCP: Treason uncloaked! Peer 192.168.33.182:55510/60222 shrinks
window 977590224:977590304. Repaired.
 | TCP: Treason uncloaked! Peer 192.168.33.185:55510/49646 shrinks
window 2483808366:2483808382. Repaired.

I searched from the web but cannot get any idea:
 * its a cluster in lab, no WAN access and only with internal
communication, thus it shouldn't be something like attack.
 * all of them are linux (red hat/centos kernel), hence it must not be
other buggy stack
 * I have checked the source, and it have already with the patch
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=2ad41065d9fe518759b695fc2640cf9c07261dd2
Does anyone have some suggestion? And if you need any more
information, I can provide it.
Thank you!
