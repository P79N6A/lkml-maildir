Do you find there is any difference between the ide-cd operation and the
ide-scsi behaviour mounting /dev/scd0 (or sr0 depending on
distribution)? Redhat just uses the SCSI version, and I use SCSI on
Slackware as well most of the time (ie. when I have a burner).
It's good that you have reported a bug, but you may not need to go
through that path at all. As noted, supposedly fixed, although I haven't
built test6 yet.
