rep;nop is a magic instruction on the PIV and possibly some PIII series CPUs
[not sure]. As far as I can make out it naps momentarily or until bus
activity thus saving power on spinlocks.
The problem is 'rep nop' is not defined on other cpus so we can only really use
it on the PIII/PIV kernel builds
