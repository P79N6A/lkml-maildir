This is insane. We add more and more of this NUMA and cpuset and anti-frag
and page zeroing logic to the page allocator, and then decide that we
don't actually need to obey any of those rules when we're running lat_proc.
You will never be able to make the page allocator faster than a single list
of pages. The reason is because we actually *want* some of these checks and
heuristics in the page allocator.
And I doubt a list of zeroed pages is the right approach. That's just
adding more complexity for lat_proc AFAIKS.
