You want softcursor to be used after console reset. Ok. I want
non-standard pallete after console reset. Should I also add an option?
What could make sense would be "Escape sequence to do after console
reset". You could type there softcursor sequence to make it solid, and
I could type there sequence to change my pallete. Seems less ugly than 
special config option for each such feature.
