Subject: [PATCH] i386: don't consider regparm EXPERIMENTAL anymore
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

  [This might be a tad premature given recent tail-call fixups?]

Drop EXPERIMENTAL status from REGPARM as a lot of people seem to use
it and it seems to be pretty stable these days.
