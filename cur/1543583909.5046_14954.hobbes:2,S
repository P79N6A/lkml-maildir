Way back whenever processing #! was moved from the
shell to the kernel** this argument would have made sense -
today I'm not so sure.
But I'm quite happy for the kernel to use just space and
tab if it wishes, or anything else for that matter but it _is_
confusing that the error code doesn't distinguish problems
with the script from problems with the interpreter.
**Did linux ever rely on the shell for this?
