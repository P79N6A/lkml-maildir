Certainly.  Comments from all are welcome.  Here is the general argument:
8139/A/B/C/D, 8100, 8139 rev K. are all supported by 8139too.
8139C+ is a totally different chip, and thus gets a totally different 
driver.  The realtek 8139C+ changes (which you posted) basically add a 
totally different driver into the same source code.  The only reason for 
this is that PCI ID for 8139C+ is similar [differs on PCI Revision Id].
finally, I emailed my RealTek contact directly, and he said RealTek has 
found no problems with 8139cp.c driver, and they support 8139cp's use.
