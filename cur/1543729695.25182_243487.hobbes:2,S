Took a look at aodv-uu.
Author should learn to create a real Kbuild Makefile...
But that does not seem to be your problem.

modpost complains that it cannot locate the symbol table in vmlinux.
That can be caused by the following reasons:
o vmlinux were build with different settings than scripts/mod
  - If you cleaned out scripts/mod/ and run make scripts with wrong ARCH options
o vmlinux has been stripped for some reason

Did not understand what you said here.
Please make sure that:
- Kernel is build with same ARCH=, CROSS_COMPILE option as modules
- That kernel is fully build, with same options
Please let me know if this info helped you fixing the problem.
