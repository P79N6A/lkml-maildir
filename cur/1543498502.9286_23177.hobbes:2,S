I know. I'm currently working on the design of this feature. I will probably
represent the counter state objects as files in a pseudo filesystem, in order to
get sharing, lifetimes [the state must survive process death if there's another
process controlling it], and mmap() access right. SMP will be also have to be
considered, but I guess I can steal code from ptrace() or kill().
