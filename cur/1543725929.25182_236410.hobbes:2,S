Without replaying conversations on V3 and wcc_ stuff I do believe that
long about 1993 or 1994 most decided that making the pre- and post-stat
info atomic w.r.t. the update was not "required" - because that would
be hard.
The WCC stuff is relegated to a hint to help detect conflicting
changes in that case I believe.
