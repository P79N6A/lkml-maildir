When compiling with -O2 -mcmodel=kernel on gcc 4.3.2, you end up with
the same 7-byte sequence:
   4:   48 c7 c7 00 00 00 00    mov    $0x0,%rdi
                        7: R_X86_64_32S bluttan
  10:   48 c7 c7 ff ff ff ff    mov    $0xffffffffffffffff,%rdi
With -Os -mcmodel=kernel, it's a bit better:
   4:   48 c7 c7 00 00 00 00    mov    $0x0,%rdi
                        7: R_X86_64_32S bluttan
  10:   48 83 cf ff             or     $0xffffffffffffffff,%rdi
I would have expected it to have used leaq in the first case, but it's
the same length (7 bytes) and probably has higher latencies.
