Sorry, but it can be triggered by _ANY_ VM since buddy allocator was
introduced. You have no guarantee, that you find two or more consecutive
free pages. And if you don't, poll() fails.

This is not about running out of memory. It is about free space
fragmentation. Think this: 
You have no swap.
Program allocates one file cache page, one anon page, one cache page, one
anon page and so on. The memory will look like:
cache page
anon page
cache page
anon page
cache page
anon page
etc.
Now some driver wants to allocate 4097 and it CAN'T. Even when there's
half memory free.
