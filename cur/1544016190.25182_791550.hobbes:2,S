I was about to say that the kernel where this worked once doesn't allow 
this to work again. I downgraded to 2.6.27 and got the same problem. But 
then I also downgraded udev, mkinitcpio, lilo, device-mapper, pciutils 
and hwdetect and reset the defaults on my BIOS and took out 
pci=assign-busses and then the card started working.

It's quite a bit different from when I remember it working the other 
time. The errors on BARs 7, 8 and 9 still show up and the card is on bus 
09. However after I did this I updated all those packages to the newest 
versions except I did so one at a time not all at once. Now I'm up to 
date and still have this card working. So I'm sorry to bother you with 
this, the kernel does not need to be patched for this at all. It's 
either a BIOS problem or a distro problem caused by updating too many 
packages at once. Either way it's fixed now. Thanks alot.
