Guys, lets not forget ourself... ok?
For an in depth explanation of the whole c/h/s lba thing go here:
http://www.mossywell.com/boot-sequence/
This is the best reference i've found thus far.
I think what we should be talking about here is what is necessary to
write a mbr and partition a disk, not how the whole c/h/s shebang works,
because that is no longer of any real interest.
The important fact here is that Linux does not really depend on an MBR
which matches the BIOS. Only other os do...
The current behaviour of partitioning tools under Linux is (most of the
time) quite simple: If an MBR exists, determine the geometry to use to
create new partitions from the MBR.
The problem starts when creating a new MBR. In this case we need a
geometry. There most Utilities depend (probably historically) on
HDIO_GETGEO. By now we know that these values do not necessarily
correspond to bios values. They don't have to, because they can contain
as much bogus as we want. Why? Because all partitions will be created
with these values as a base. The question here is actually only if the
user wants compatible values or not.
The problem increases when we use tools such as dosemu, which need to
emulate a bios. If we do things there like deploy windows with dosemu
(please remember, this is just an example), the geometry values
represented by dosemu need to be exactly the same as the bios returns.
The problem increases further with the use of bootloaders. Because they
need at least some basic geometry information. See the thread "Support
HDIO_GETGEO on device-mapper volumes" in this mailinglist for an example
(Actually this thread is among the reasons why I started this).
So the whole thing comes to the question whether we drop any interfaces
reporting geometry, making userspace tools responsible or if we provide
a common interface which can be modified by userspace if necessary.
(There are no other workable options i can see)
I vote for keeping it in the kernel, because otherwise tons of
user-space tools would need to be modified and it actually might be the
case that a driver knows what he's returning...
