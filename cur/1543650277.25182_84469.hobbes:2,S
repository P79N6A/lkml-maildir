|

I expect this to be unpopular, but I've been saying lately that
when new kernel APIs or syscalls or whatsoever are added to
Linux, there should be sufficient docs along with the patch(es)
explaining the patch and some intended uses of it, perhaps even
with examples.  Ingo does this sometimes.  Some people don't
bother to even come close.
Leading by example would be a nice thing to see here.
And "use the source Luke" is cool and is definitive.
But it's not the only way to get things done.
Well, maybe it is, but it shouldn't and needn't be.
| epoll seems to be a good and desirable thing.  To move forward I
| believe we need to get this code reviewed, and documented.
|

| it.  But until that is completed I would oppose inclusion of this
| code.
