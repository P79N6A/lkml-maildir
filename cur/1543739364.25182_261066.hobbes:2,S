You are talking about the make believe case that only exists due to
the *current* implementation of Linux UDP packet reading. It doesn't
have to exist. It exists only behaviour nobody saw fit to implement it
with semantics that were reliable, because the implentors didn't foresee
blocking file descriptors being used. It's an implementation oversight.

We're not talking about future behaviour. We're talking about past behaviour.
That the kernel chose to delay making a decision too long to tell the truth
in select() is not reasonable for blocking sockets. The answer *MUST* be,
fix it for blocking sockets, or tell the truth, and just say - blocking
file descriptors for UDP sockets should not be used with select(). Why is
that so hard? Why all the distracting and minimizing language about
recommendations?

Sure, but this isn't about the future, remember. The kernel already has the
information to know whether there is data, or whether there isn't. It just
isn't doing the work to find out.

That's a liberal understanding. It's also distracting. select() could know
that the packet will be discarded. It chooses to not.

Allowed by who? For select() to say data is ready, and read() to block,
is not allowed by all the standards that I have read. This is the first
time I have ever heard of a situation like this, for select(). It is *not*
the same as writing an arbitrary number of bytes, or accepting.
You say it will not break any application that could not already be broken
by other circumstances. I disagree. For example, a UDP-based server that
only receives, and never sends, would be perfectly happy to select() on
several file descriptors, and readmesg() whenever the UDP file descriptor
says readable. It would not break on other operating systems that implement
select() to be useful for determining whether or not to read() from a
blocking file descriptor.
