We are moving in that direction... but not until we get a satisfactory
solution to this problem.  We need to be able to support 2.0.x for the
short term.

At this point, I agree, it is not correct because it takes an upper
layer buffer, with/without IP header, acquires an skb, then sends it
on its way, checking to see if it needs to allocate more than one skb
for fragments.  We may need to put something in here to deal with
fragmentation decisions when we move to the Better Way (tm), but the
bulk of our code should be called from a firewall chain.  This does
not help us now.

Right, I had another look.  They call dev_queue_xmit(), after changing
skb->dev.  The difference is they do not increase the packet size in
the process, which we do.  We need to be able to deal, dynamically,
with packets that grow in size after processing.  dev_queue_xmit()
does not check mtu size to see if it needs fragmenting.
neigh_compat_output(), neigh_resolve_output() and
neigh_connected_output() are similarly too low level.  It is too
late at this point.  Conversely, ip_queue_xmit() ip_build_xmit() are
too high, since it does not have the IP header in place yet.  The
firewall chains are exactly where it belongs.
- From all the other code I have examined, it looks like I need to call
ip_fragment(skb, skb->dst->output) and modify ip_fragment() to check
to see if skb->dst->dev still equals skb->dev and take a new MTU if
they are different.

It is time to go back and do another thorough re-read...

The only ones I can use as a reference are KAME and OpenBSD.  The
former should be interesting.  Both use mbufs!
