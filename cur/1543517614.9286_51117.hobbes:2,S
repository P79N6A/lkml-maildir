Hi there
Firstly, apologies for addressing this question to
Linux Kernel...
Has anyone out there ever tried to connect a Sun
Monitor to a VGA adapter?  Is it possible?  Is there
an adapter plug, or maybe a standard pin re-wiring
that is easy to do?
The VGA plugs seem to have 12 connected pins; the Suns
have 13 (or is it 16 - the three "big" pins each have an
inner and an outer contact).
