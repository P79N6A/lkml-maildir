It's set to 0 :-(

So this is not the case.
Any more clues? I want to try different tape drives as well, but so far the
first batch of old DDS drives I found at work seem to be no longer functional.
Let's fetch some other drives tomorrow :-)
BTW, I tried my good old 2.4.0-test1-ac10 kernel from June 2000, and it also
suffered from the same problem. Also note that I did read/write tests on the
tape drive when I just bought it and when I installed the Sym53c875 later, and
I never noticed the problem. So I'm still willing to believe it's a software
bug in recent(?) kernels...
