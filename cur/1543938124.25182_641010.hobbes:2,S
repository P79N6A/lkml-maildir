It's probably just as well, since we don't really know how to get a 
message out in such an environment anyway...

I was thinking about this yesterday, and it seems to me that there are 
two cleaner options here...
- either we should put in the full machinery to be able to run C code 
compiled with -fPIC/-fPIE before paging is enabled.  Unfortunately gcc 
generates R_386_GOT32 relocations for external references even with 
-fPIE, so we'll have to put in some code to adjust the GOT (easy enough 
to do.)
As far as the native accessors are concerned, the right thing to do 
would is to use the native_ forms thereof, not #undef CONFIG_PARAVIRT.
- alternatively, we recognize that this isn't all that big of a piece of 
code and doing it in C really isn't necessary.  We can have a small 
assembly loop for PAE that matches the small assembly loop we already 
have for !PAE.

No, but (pte_t *) is 32 bits.  To be more "Linuxy" it probably should be 
(long) or (unsigned long) though.
