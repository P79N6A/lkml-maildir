Manually compiling the two items that are contained in the rpm (modutils and
module-init-tools) did indeed give different problems from "rpm --rebuild".
I reported them around two weeks ago or so.  "make modules" has nothing to
do with this.

WRONG.  ACPI DOESN'T WORK ON THE MACHINE I'M DOING THIS ON.  DID
YOU TRY READING WHAT YOU QUOTED THERE?  Yes I know you volunteer
more effort on Linux than I do, but you're asking me to flame you anyway.
How many times do you need to be told?
> Well, ACPI has still some broken functionality, like S3 states,
S3 has nothing to do with it.  Whether and how much ACPI functionality the
vendor put in the BIOS has everything to do with it.  If you read what you
quoted from me, you might reach the same opinion I have, that it would have
been better for the vendor to include no ACPI functionality at all instead
of some experiments at partial ACPI support.  But even if you don't agree,
ACPI still doesn't work on that machine.

Hmm.  Then some dependency seems to be broken in kernel compilation.  When
ACPI is not compiled in, it should know that the effect of "pci=usepirqmask"
should be compiled in (whatever that effect is).

Could be, but then I'll have no power management at all because ACPI doesn't
work but APM will disable itself when APM thinks that ACPI looks like it's
running.  How many times do you need to be told, guess why I did "acpi=off
apm=on".
