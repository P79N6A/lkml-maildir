Okay - those are sane.  Those are the IRQ routing MSRs - each nibble is an
IRQ for something in the southbridge - since 7 doesn't appear, a rogue
interrupt isn't likely.  Also, [0:31] in 0x51400022 are the MFGPT interrupts
specifically, and they are 0.  The timer tick code would set the first nibble
to 7 (in a sane system).
So, everything _seems_ okay from the hardware side.  The next step would be
to comment out the setup_irq() function and write a C app or something to
verify that all the MFGPT registers are set up like we expect them to be.
However, I think that maybe we can accomplish the same thing with the
forthcoming watchdog timer, since it will prove the MFGPT is behaving
well (though it doesn't use the interrupt wrapper, but one step at a time).
