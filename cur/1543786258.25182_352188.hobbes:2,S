Yeah.  Not always feasible though; let's say the bug manifests in
something Apache tells the kernel to do (there's quite a lot of
syscalls) based on stuff passed to CGI scripts.  Firewalls and
everything, but slide in a "legitimate" port 80 or port 443 access and BLAM.
Shell servers like compile farms are also interesting, if you want to
talk about firewalling not being all that great.  That's of course if
you care about local attacks; personally if I have 10000 employees or
clients using a machine I don't want to trust them all to be nice.

Beautiful setup that, and surprisingly cost effective if 1) you can do
it yourself, and 2) you're using just 2 nodes.  I'd prefer 3 nodes for a
minimal set-up of course, so if I upgrade one and the other goes down I
still have a third; I'm obsessive about perfectly stable environments,
it has to be able to stand up to a bomb blast or the ending scene from
Hackers with all the blackhats in the world tearing ass at the system.
