Subject: [PATCH 0/2] intro: make NFSv4 exclusive open calls set and use the bitmask in the reply
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Around a year ago, Chris Lalancette posted a patch to make it so that
when an EXCLUSIVE nfs4 create is done, that the mtime and atime get
properly updated in the following setattr call. At the time Trond
replied that that approach was incorrect and that we need to check the
bitmask in the reply to know what attributes need to be updated.
The original thread is here:
http://linux-nfs.org/pipermail/nfsv4/2006-June/004489.html
The following patchset is a first stab at making the Linux client and
server adhere to the correct NFS4 exclusive open semantics.
As always, comments are appreciated...
