It's already what it does, but I don't use the segment base in the TSS nor
check the segment limit. It will take me quite some time to understand how
all this is implemented in the kernel and unfortunately I don't have such
time now.

agreed, but there are some programs which don't need speed at all, hence the
reason for my first implementation of cmov (which burnt about 400 cycles IIRC).

Well, this is an interesting question. I don't know how to do it this way
(how can a program know exactly where the trap occured, etc... I don't know
how to program this). Other than that, LD_PRELOAD will not work against setuid
binaries. But if it does for the rest, I think it can become an elegant
approach.
Thanks for your insights,
Willy
