Yeah.  This is a good point, although I can't think of info
about a system's hardware and software configuration that would
be particularly sensitive, other than files that contain network
topology or encrypted passwords.  I'm sure others can come up
with such a list.  One candidate might be the smbfs configuration
file, since network passwords can live there, right?  tcpdump output
might also be sensitive, but that type of info would need to get 
requested by network driver developers after the initial bug report 
anyhow.
