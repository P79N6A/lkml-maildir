I wrote a script a while ago that modprobe'd & rmmod'd every module
it could find. Results weren't pretty.
Lessons learned:
- lots of driver writers don't take into consideration the fact the hardware
  might not be present when the driver does probing.
- Those that do, fail to clean up properly in this case.
- A lot of drivers leave junk in sysfs/procfs after rmmod which causes
  great fun for the next driver that gets loaded that uses the same subsystems.
It's been a few months since I last ran that script, but I'll bet
the results today aren't much better than they were back then
despite a bunch of problems I reported getting fixed.
