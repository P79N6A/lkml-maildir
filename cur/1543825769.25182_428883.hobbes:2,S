Jan, I don't plan on forcing fbdev/DRM on anyone. My work is going to leave 
vgacon alone, and if my work at making DRM and FBdev cooperate goes as 
planned, those two will remain independant, though part of my work aims at 
having fbdev provide all 2D graphics acceleration for DRM while DRM handles 
the 3D stuff via the Mesa libraries or similar.
