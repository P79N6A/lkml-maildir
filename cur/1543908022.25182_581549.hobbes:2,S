Yes, it gets the zonelist from the node and uses a nodemask to ignore
zones within it.

You have the local node_id to lookup the zonelist with. The policy
provides a nodemask then instead of a zonelist for filtering purposes.

The starting node can be determined from where we are currently running
on. Even if the local node is not in the nodemask, we'd still filter it
as normal.

Thanks anyway.
