Yes.  Most filesystems expect to find either 1) old data or 2) new
data.  Blocks full of 0xff are non-expected.
These expectations are quite reasonable for hard disk media, which is
what the filesystems were designed for.

The assumption is merely that, at no time, there will be random data
on the medium.  Both old and new data is somewhat well-defined.  It
doesn't take a PhD to see a potential problem when moving to flash.
