*exactly*  I don't know enough about ext2fs to know if this is possible
(i.e. a partially filled block in the middle of a file) so that's why I
asked.

For editing commercials, you'd still have to copy 90% of the data.  In
the US, there's roughly 5 minutes of commercials for every 15 of the
show, so that would only save copying the first 15 minutes...

Yep.  I should mention that the Linux/mjpeg tools
(
http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net
) already have an elegant way of "marking"
a portion of a video and skipping it when playing it, through the use of
"edit lists".  (use xlav/glav to mark it, and then you can lavplay the
edit list, which just contains the start/end of skipped sections)  They
also have a program to apply the edit list and create a new video
(lavtrans).  But this requires copying the desired sections of video to
a new file, which requires 75% more disk space than the original file,
and takes a looong time.
The idea behind my first message should be obvious here...an almost
atomic operation modifying at most 2 blocks (and marking a bunch as
free) wouldn't require nearly as much disk-thrashing, and would be
nearly instantaneous from the user's perspective.
Disk fragmentation is unimportant when the contiguous chunks are 300MB
long.

Do the journaling filesystems use blocks in a similar manner to ext2fs?
Anyone know if any of them can handle partially filled blocks in the
middle of a file?
Are there any media-filesystems out there that have these kinds of
extensions?  I'm not sure these extensions would be useful for anything
but editing media...

Yep yep yep.  What do multimedia people use?  Custom multi-thousand
dollar programs with their own filesystem layer?  What about TiVo?
Didn't they contribute some fs-layer modifications a while back?
