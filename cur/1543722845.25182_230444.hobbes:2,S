Why not? The thing is, the bitmap operators are supposed to work on 
volatile data, ie people are literally using them for things like
	while (test_bit(TASKLET_STATE_SCHED, &t->state));
and the thing is supposed to work.
Now, I personally am not a big believer in the "volatile" keyword itself, 
since I believe that anybody who expects the compiler to generate 
different code for volatiles and non-volatiles is pretty much waiting for 
a bug to happen, but there are two cases where I think it's ok:
 - in function prototypes to show that the function can take volatile data 
   (and not complain).
 - as an arch-specific low-level implementation detail to avoid having to 
   use inline assembly just to load a value. Ie a _data_structure_ should 
   never be volatile, but it's ok to use a volatile pointer for a single 
   access.
I believe the bitop functions fall under #1 - the function is clearly
supposed to handle the case of a volatile pointer, and if it is inlined,
the above endless while-loop must not just load the bit once and turn it 
into an endless loop - it needs to re-load the thing every iteration.

I disagree. Why wouldn't they be volatile?
