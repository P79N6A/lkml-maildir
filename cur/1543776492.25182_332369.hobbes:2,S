Yes. I chose 1000 originally partly as a way to make sure that people that
assumed HZ was 100 would get a swift kick in the pants. That meant making
a _big_ change, not a small subtle one. For example, people tend to react
if "uptime" suddenly says the machine has been up for a hundred days (even
if it's really only been up for ten), but if it is off by just a factor of
two, it might be overlooked.
So 1kHz was a bit of an overkill, but it worked well enough that we never 
really got around to changing it.
