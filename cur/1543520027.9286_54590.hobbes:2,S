Hello:
I just upgraded my system from Redhat 6.0 to kernel 2.2.13.
The kernel boots and the OS begins to run, but I ran into
the following problems:
1. According to the man page, mount now supports ntfs file
	systems, but when I type mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/ntfs
	I get a message stating that the kernel does not
	support ntfs.
2. When I try to run kppp, I get a message stating that 
	the kernel does not support PPP.
	I did set the CONFIG_PPP on the kernel options
	and did make modules and make modules_install.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
	Neil.
