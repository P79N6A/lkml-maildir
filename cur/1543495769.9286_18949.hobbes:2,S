Is there anyone who would be willing to write kernel support for CD-RW ?
The CD-RW should be mountable just as any standard block device,
and the standard file commands (cp,mv,rm, etc.) should work without any
special program (other than the new kernel or module loaded).
Also, is there anyone willing to write NTFS support with write abilities?
Just being able to read NTFS partitions isn't all that useful.
And now for the big question:
Which distribution (Slackware, Redhat, etc.) does Linus use?
If he has his own dist. would he release it to the rest of us?
