That's because the patch just adds debugging seems to be sufficient to
cause the bug to disappear.  It isn't a fix.
The only explaination I have at the moment is that it changes the timing
- maybe there's a bug in these UARTs... I don't know at the moment.
What I do know is that Alan's original premise seems wrong.
