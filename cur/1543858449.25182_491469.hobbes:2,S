It has to be written once, but compiled for every kernel version and 
$arch out there (for out of tree drivers), or it has to wait for the 
next kernel release and distro sync (for in-tree drivers).
If we make userspace drivers possible, it makes sense that the entire 
driver be in userspace, not just 98.7% of it.
