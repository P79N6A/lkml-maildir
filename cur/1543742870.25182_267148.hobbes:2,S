a couple of conceptual questions: why does rtc_wakeup poll() on
/dev/rtc? Shouldnt a read() be enough?
i'm seeing some weird traces, which show rtc_wakeup doing this cycle:
	[~900 usecs pass]
	hardirq 8 comes in, wakes IRQ 8 thread
	IRQ 8 thread wakes up rtc_wakeup
	rtc_wakeup fast-thread returns from sys_read()
	rtc_wakeup fast-thread enters sys_poll() and returns immediately
	rtc_wakeup fast-thread enters sys_read() and blocks
	rtc_wakeup slow-thread runs and does the calculations.
	[repeat]
this i think shows that the logic is wrong somewhere and that read()
will achieve the blocking. This also means that the sys_read()-return +
sys_poll() overhead is added to the 'IRQ wakeup' overhead!
removing the poll() lines doesnt seem to impact the quality of the data,
but i still see roughly 50 usecs added to the 'real' latency that i see
in traces.
