Hey there,
the patch Andries Brouwer gave me seems to work. That is, I can mount the
USB stick like:
mount /dev/sda /mnt/usbstick -t vfat
the specification of the filesystem is mandatory, mount will not auto
recognize the filesystem. Unfortunately I can not yet say if it's fully
compatible with the Wyse Terminal and/or windows 2000 as I'm having a few
days off and won't be back at work where I can test it until wednesday.
The files that were put on it by the Wyse are perfectly viewable however
and I'm able to write as well.
fdisk -l /dev/sda will still not see any partitions however, dispite that
it looks to me like there's one on it, judging by the hexdump of the
device:
> 00000000  eb fe 90 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 02 08 01 00

Windows appears to recognize it as a partition as well, but it remains to
be seen how trustworthy disk management is of course. Especially since it
doesn't allow me to create nor remove partitions on this device and any
other usb sticks I've tried.
Is this going to be included in the kernel, or will there be a more
elegant solution? In any case, I'm willing to help test it of course.
Thanks for the help.
Kind regards,
Ferry van Steen
