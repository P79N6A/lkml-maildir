I missed this discussion. is this idea to suspend, write to disk, but 
leave things in ram so that if you wakeup soon enough you have everything 
for ram, but if you don't and the battery dies you can restore from disk?
if so I think it's a mistake to mix the two. it would be better to just 
suspend to ram, and wake up once in a while to check the battery state and 
when the battery gets low enough do the suspend to disk.
otherwise you end up mixing the requirements of the two types of suspend, 
which is how things got so ugly in the first place.

true, but if you get something that can work reliably, even if ugly, you 
get a lot more people willing to polish it then is you are asking them to 
help you implement the core features.
remember release early, release often (with something that functions)

on the other hand, worrying about all the possible ways to do things can 
paralize you.
the big advantage of the kexec approach is that the new userspace that's 
setup with the new kernel can do _anything_. if/when this works you will 
see people doing things that you probably never imagined (a simple one is 
to suspend a machine at work, send the image over the network and resume 
on a different machine at home). and all these strange things are 
encapsulated so that you don't have to worry about how they will be done 
now.
it's good to try and find the places where you have fundamental changes to 
make to support them, but there are a lot of things that boil down to 
implementation details, everyone agrees that it can be done reliably, the 
decisions on how just need to be made.
