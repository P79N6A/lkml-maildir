NOBSDSTRUCT should not be defined in your case.
It means, that netinet/ip.h contains NO BSD STRUCTs 8)
It is evaluated in Makefile, based on presence of bsd/bsd.h
Is it true that the latest libc5 versions have bsd/bsd.h and have
no bsd/netinet/? I daresay H.J.Lu made some really stupid
things before stopping work on libc5 :-(

Yes 8)8) I use three installations now: sparc/glibc-2.0.7,
alpha/glibc-1.99 and intel/libc5. But all they are "customized" 8)
Customization for glibc-2.0.7 may be found in
ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/.glibc/, my libc5 is pretty old (5.3.8) and
it still has "perfect" BSD emulation mode.
+#ifndef NBBY
+#include <bsd/bsd.h>
+#endif
OK, it is great idea! I'll test whether it works with another
installations.
About NO_ANK_FIX:
It is not supposed to work with NO_ANK_FIX certainly 8)8)
It is not an option, but just marker of a change, which I use
as reminder.
