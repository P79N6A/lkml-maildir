gcc -v will tell you the final include path, but only when you
actually compile something. I'd probably make the makefile hackery parse
the ouput of echo | gcc -v -E -. Yeah, it's ugly.
The output between "#include <...> search starts here:" and "End of
search list." seems like the combination of what you want for
gcc_includepath and sys_includepath. I assume the output is ordered. I
might send a patch if I'm bored tonight.
