This is how I handle it.  It requires no setup at handler registration time 
(not that I did on purpose, anyway).
void user_segv_handler(int sig)
{
  struct sigcontext_struct *sc;
  sc = (struct sigcontext_struct *) (&sig + 1);
  ...
}

A bunch of people do.  The above is taken from my user-mode port of the kernel.
