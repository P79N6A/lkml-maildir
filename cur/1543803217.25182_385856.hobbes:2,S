We were originally going to use CONFIG_LBD, but there were some complaints
that "sector_t" isn't the right variable to use for this, even though they
are remarkably close.  That would at least remove one config change.
I don't think the cost is in the vmlinux itself, but rather that having a
long long for i_blocks is overkill for any but the very largest systems
(Lustre has been running fine w/o this, at the expense of some accuracy
for the i_blocks count on many-TB files).  Growing struct inode for these
0.0000001% of systems is probably harmful for small systems, given how
many inodes are used in a system.
Two options exist IMHO:
- remove the new CONFIG_* parameters and stick with CONFIG_LBD (this could
  still use a separate type from sector_t if desired) to reduce the amount
  of testing combinations needed
- make the new CONFIG_* default to on and allow it to be disabled with
  CONFIG_BASE_SMALL
Cheers, Andreas
