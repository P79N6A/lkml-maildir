Another option would be to access the medium through a mapping inode,
replay the journal into the mapping inode and _not_ flush the dirty
pages.  But as long as a remapping table is sufficient for ext3 journal
format, such a table should be simpler and faster.

Not likely to come from me anytime soon.  There's a certain other
filesystem I have to finish first that still suffers from the same
problem.
