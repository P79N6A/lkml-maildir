The other events don't happen by definition. 
If the system is C1 idle there are no cache misses, no pipe line events,
nothing - just cache snoops and waiting for interrupts and TSC
ticking.

It also depends on which C state and how the BIOS implements your C state.
e.g. there is C1/C2/C3 and then there are various modi of C1
(HLT aka C1 is actually some SMM code in the BIOS that does different
stuff). 
I think there is at least one mode that ramps down large parts of the
CPU (it's called C1 clock ramping - that is what has caused the TSC
sync problems on some dual core systems).
I guess your BIOS is not very aggressive in its SMM code in
disabling the CPU.
C2/C3 also depend on SMM code, but when implemented should definitely
stop everything.
Intel also has different implementations of C1/C2/C3 depending
on CPU and BIOS. Especially lowend code 
But I still maintain something must be wrong with your 
measurements.
