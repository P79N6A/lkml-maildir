I made a brief attempt to do busybox on klibc before klcc was working
right for me.  I should try that again.  In Ubuntu, we already do a
separate build pass of busybox to get just the features that we want, it
would be easy to play with this.
I'll let you know.  It'll take me a couple days - between travelling and
the long weekend, I'm a bit behind.
Tks,
