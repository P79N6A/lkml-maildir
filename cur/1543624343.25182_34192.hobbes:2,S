Erik, that is precisely the point on which the Amiga discussions of
the Direct SCSI command capability in scsi device drivers fell down.
(Due to historical oddities even IDE device drivers feature the direct
SCSI interface via emulation. It seems like an ultimate horror. However
it has enabled some marvelously generic tools.)
