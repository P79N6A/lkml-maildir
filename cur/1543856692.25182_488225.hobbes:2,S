Maybe we should create another internal generic_file_aio_read/write
for in-core function? fs/read_write.c and fs/aio.c are not module-able
and the check is already there.  For external module, we can do the
check and then calls down to the internal one.
I hate to see iov is being walked multiple times ....  And this is
part of my effort to bring back O_DIRECT performance compares to a
3-years old vendor kernel based on 2.4 kernel.
