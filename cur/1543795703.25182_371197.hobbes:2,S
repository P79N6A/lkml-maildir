Subject: [Patch] 2.4.32 - Neighbour Cache (ARP) State machine bug Fixed
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/28/152

In 2.4.21, arp code uses gc_timer to check for stale arp cache
entries. In 2.6, each entry has its own timer to check for stale arp
cache. 2.4.29 to 2.4.32 kernels (atleast) use neither of these timers.
This causes problems in environments where IPs or MACs are reassigned
- saw this problem on load balancing router based networks that use
VMACs. Tested this code on load balancing router based networks as
well as peer-linux systems.
Let me know if I need to contact someone else about this,
Thanks,
Pradeep Vincent
