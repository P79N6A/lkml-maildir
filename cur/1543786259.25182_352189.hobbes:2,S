SCSI is broken in several cases by a lack of the patch below, which means 
some of the regular test boxes can't - James, any chance of getting that
one upstream? (it's cut and pasted, but then you wouldn't want to apply
it anyway without correct "flow" ;-)).
Thanks,

OK, my fault.  Your fix is almost correct .. I was going to do this
eventually, honest, because there's no need to unprep and reprep a
command that comes in through scsi_queue_insert().
However, I decided to leave it in to exercise the scsi_unprep_request()
path just to make sure it was working.  What's happening, I think, is
that we also use this path for retries.  Since we kill and reget the
command each time, the retries decrement is never seen, so we're
retrying forever.
This should be the correct reversal.
