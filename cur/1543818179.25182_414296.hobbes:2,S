Have you actually tried without that mechanism? No compromise will be correct 
there for fairness one way or the other. There simply is no way to tell if a 
task is really sleeping or really just waiting on a runqueue. That's why Ingo 
weighted the tasks waking from interrupts more because of their likely 
intent. It's still a best guess scenario (which I'm sure you know). Wouldn't 
it be lovely to have a system that didn't guess and had simple sleep/wake cpu 
usage based heuristics? Oh well.

I'm quite aware of the effect it has :)

Your compromise is as good as any.
