btw., the _RET() methods are rather ugly as they include an implicit 
code flow change (a 'return' statement).
Please change it to a more readable form that preserves the code flow, 
something like:
  if (RB_WARN_ON(buffer, cond))
	return -1;
See kernel/lockdep.c about how to do this cleanly: introduce a 
_single_ global "oh, we are broken" flag which is increased once and 
never decreased again.
In the case of lockdep that's the debug_locks flag. It's used in 
various code-flow-preserving forms of debug checks:
...
        if (DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(depth >= 20))
                return;
...
                if (!debug_locks_off_graph_unlock())
                        return NULL;
...
        if (!debug_locks_off_graph_unlock())
                return 0;
...
        if (!__raw_spin_is_locked(&lockdep_lock))
                return DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(1);
etc.
