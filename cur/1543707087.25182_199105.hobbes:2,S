That's interesting... I didn't want to do a full mode + engine restore
in unblank_screen though as this can be called from interrupt time by
printk... But then, with the LVDS blanking, I already have to delay
up to 1 second in this function, so .... I think I'll have to find a
way to abstract a delay function that schedules in normal case _but_
when called from printk....

Do we want to pay the cost (in time) of a full mode set + engine reset
on each unblank ? I could limit myself to restoring the accel engine,
that faster, but with X also not always restoring the console mode
properly, I'd have preferred re-setting the whole mode... 
Maybe we should go that way for now (engine only in unblank), then try
to fix X for the mode thing (if doable.... there is some VGA magic in
there that I don't understand)
Ben.
