I'm experiencing a similar problem, but with kernel 2.2.11 (and on a
much smaller machine: a 200MMX, with 3C509 ethernet card.)
On HIGH network loads, e.g. 5M file copy via NFS or rcp to/from a
Solaris server on the same LAN, the PC freezes up as follows:
- mouse, keyboard do not work any more
- I cannot telnet to it
- I cannot get date via UDP
- I CAN ping it
So the ethernet card works, ICMP works, while TCP and UDP do not. (Or,
at least, telnet and date services are down).
