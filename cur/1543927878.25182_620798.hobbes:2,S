I'd personally not like to see SMACK appear in a capability name. No
offense Casey, but SMACK may be displaced with YAMAC (*) someday, and
I'd hate to have wasted a capability on it. Using CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE makes
sense to me - even if its not (yet/ever) honored by all MAC LSMs.
I do have a question about whether one capability is sufficient in
general for MAC. Looking at the:
  
http://wt.xpilot.org/publications/posix.1e/download.html
last draft, there are no less than 5 capabilities (p173) allocated for
MAC. Presumably there was a good reason for 5 and not 1 back then -
could you summarize what is different now?
Thanks
Andrew
