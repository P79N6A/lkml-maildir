I've found many more places in the kernel that use their own functions for
doing this. These patches are the beginning of an attempt to clean these
up.
The first patch adds a generic round_up_pow2() macro to kernel.h. The
remaining patches modify a few files to make use of the new macro.
Comments welcome.
Thanks,
Nick
