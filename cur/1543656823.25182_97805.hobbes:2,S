Can you please make your patches be rooted the "standard" way, ie do
	diff -ruN linux-old-dir linux-new-dir
so that they apply cleanly with a "patch -p1" and the diff headers say
something like
	--- xxxx/arch/v850/vmlinux.lds.S
	+++ yyyy/arch/v850/vmlinux.lds.S
because that's how all my tools are set up to take patches.
I've done it by hand now, but it's somewhat tedious, and if I'm lazy (most
of the time) it ends up meaning that I normally just drop patches that
don't apply cleanly.
