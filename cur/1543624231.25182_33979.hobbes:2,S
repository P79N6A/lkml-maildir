Andre, get a fucking clue.  If you claim that your "filtering" provides
any security - you are making fradulent claims.  End of story.
Fact of life: process with EUID 0 can bypass your "protection" easily.
IF filtering is useful for some reasons, these reasons have nothing to
security.
Again, by mentioning security considerations among the reasons you
are harming yourself - it's kinda hard to take you seriously if you do
not understand the basic stuff.  It's not like we didn't have that
conversation before...
