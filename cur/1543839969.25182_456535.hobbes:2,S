Word "polling" really confuses me here, but now I understand you.
Such approach actually has unresolved issues - consider for
example a situation when all provided events are ready immediately - what
should be returned (as far as I recall they are always added into kqueue in
BSDs before started to be checked, so old events will be returned
first)? And currently ready events can be read through mapped buffer
without any syscall at all.
And Linux syscall is much cheaper than BSD's one.
Consider (especially apped buffer)  that issues, it really does not cost
interface complexity.

First of all, there are completely different types.
Design of the in-kernel part is very different too.

From your description there is a serious problem with arches which
supports different width of the pointer. I do not have sources of ny BSD
right now, but if it is really like you've described, it can not be used
in Linux at all.

No way - timespec uses long.
