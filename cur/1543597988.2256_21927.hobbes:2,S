Its quite simple:
int sys_foo(struct pt_regs regs)
{
}
does not reveal the user space registers on ARM.  It instead reveals crap.
Why?  The ARM procedure call standard specifies that the first 4 words
of "regs" in this case are in 4 processor registers.  The other words
are on the stack immediately above the frame created by foo.  This is
not how the stack is layed out on ARM on entry to a sys_* function
due to the requirement for these to be restartable.
Instead, we must pass a pointer thusly:
int sys_foo(struct pt_regs *regs)
{
}
and the pointer is specifically setup and passed in by a very small
assembler wrapper.

Correct.  But the act of getting "struct pt_regs" on entry to the function
is also architecture specific.

It used to be with such functions as sys_execve.  Then, sys_execve
became an architecture specific wrapper around do_execve (not by my
hand), so I guess that its not an ARM specific problem.
