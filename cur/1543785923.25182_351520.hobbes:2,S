Some kernel threads have a producer-consumer relationship with their
clients, and it's important that they wake exactly once each time they are
invoked.  A semaphore is the natural way to manage such a thread, but the
kthread API isn't set up to handle such things.  It's possible to make
this work, by using a manual poor-man's semaphore implementation, but that
seems ridiculous.
Would this patch be acceptable?
Alan Stern
Enhance the kthread API so that it can be used with threads that wait on a 
semaphore when they are idle.
