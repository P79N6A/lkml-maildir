Hi All,
I have one process hung on my linux smp system (2 processors) running
RedHat Linux 7.
The command
% ps -eo fname,tty,pid,stat,pcpu,nwchan,wchan
gives the following information about the command :
COMMAND TT       PID      STAT %CPU   WCHAN   WCHAN
rm      tty2     21760    R    99.8       -   -
Is there any way to find out why this particular process is hung
and where exactly in the kernel is it hanging ? The WCHAN field
does not tell me anything. Also, the stat of the process is always
runnable and the % CPU is always 99.8. This process is like
this since last 2 days.
Thanks and regards,
-hiren
