Bah. Not so. It matters not at all if you try to write portable code. 
Linux has extensions. Deal with it. We have literally _thousands_ of 
things that work on Linux but not on other OS's. The fact is, you can't 
just recompile and assume something works, and waitid() has absolutely 
nothing to do with it.

Problem solved.
