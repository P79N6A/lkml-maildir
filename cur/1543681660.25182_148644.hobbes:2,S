Well, for USB maybe hotplug would handle the change, all the other
stuff should better be the same.
It probably will work even with (for example) slightly different BIOS
version, but... don't count on that.
If you want to migrate programs between machines, run UMLinux, same
config, on both machines. Ouch and you'll need swsusp for UMLinux, too
;-).
