You can still have the SCSI driver as a module but you will need a RAM disk 
(with the SCSI module on the RAM disk of course) so that the driver can be 
loaded.  Compiling the driver into the kernel does simplify things in that you 
may not have to need to worry about a RAM disk which can be a pain to build on 
a system.  However having a RAM disk makes life a lot easier if you are doing 
any kind of "generic" builds.
