 It's not CONFIG_REGPARM :-(, I have turned it off, recompiled, reboot
-> same effect (it seems the list dropped my mail with bootlog, should I
resend it to the list with gzip compression?).
 If someone can help me what patches should I revert, I would be happy
to help OTOH.

 I have started on Sun's SparcStaion (LX actually), and I like RISC
processors much more since then. :-)

 Yup, that can be the reason why Andrew saw only 0.6% save on program text.
