It would be nice if there was a Crypto API algorithm variant which
didn't do the FIPS-180-1 padding, for those applications (like
/dev/random) that don't need it.

Multiple arguments were made for dropping the folding, not just as a
"temporary measure".  You were the one that made the excuse of "cat
/dev/urandom > /dev/hda1", not me...

Agreed, fixing the locking is much more important than CryptoAPI
changes.  Can you send me a pointer to your latest locking patches?
I'd like to look them over.  Thanks!!
