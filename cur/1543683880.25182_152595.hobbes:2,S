Hello Manuel,
I've applied your patches
- request_firmware_own-workqueue.diff
- sysfs-bin-unbreak.diff
and it's working very well for the av7110 DVB driver.
I hope that these patches are applied to the mainline kernel soon, so 
the other DVB drivers which need binary firmware blobs (namely 
dvb-ttusb-dec, dvb-ttusb-budget and one frontend driver) can be ported.
This will get rid of the av7110 firmware in the kernel and the ugly 
config hacks to get the other drivers working.
CU
Michael.
