The pata-drivers branch has never received any libata*.[ch] changes in 
its entire lifetime, and you've no doubt noticed libata*.[ch] PATA work 
appearing in the upstream kernel, even when pata_*.c continues to not 
exist in the upstream kernel.  Core stuff has always been split up; 
maybe I just didn't say that explicitly.  Its pretty self-evident by 
looking at public commits, though.
