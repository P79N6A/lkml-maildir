I have extra information from the trial of this module:
noload:
Kernel                  Time            CPU             Ratio
2.4.19                  72.90           99%             1.00
2.4.19-ck7              71.55           100%            0.98
2.5.38                  73.86           99%             1.01
2.5.38-mm2              73.93           99%             1.01
fork_load:
Kernel                  Time            CPU             Ratio
2.4.19                  97.11           67%             1.33
2.4.19-ck7              72.34           92%             0.99
2.5.38                  75.32           92%             1.03
2.5.38-mm2              74.99           92%             1.03
2.4.19: Children forked: 32750
2.4.19-ck7: Children forked: 6477
2.5.38: Children forked: 5545
2.5.38-mm2: Children forked: 5351
You can see clearly repeatedly forking a new process significantly slows down
compile time for 2.4.19 but not the O(1) based kernels. However, the number of
processes that are forked is significantly reduced.
Is this information useful?
