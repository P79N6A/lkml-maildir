Turns out that my first instinct was right, and there is a good reason
not to.  It doesn't improve readability nor do anything functional, it
only adds clutter.  I much prefer the look of plain old ticks, and
having nanoseconds only intrude where they're required.  I did change
NS_TICK to the less obfuscated (1000000000 / HZ), with task_timeslice()
returning a more readable ticks * NS_TICK conversion.
