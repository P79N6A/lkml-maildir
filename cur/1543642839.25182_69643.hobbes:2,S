Is there any plan to do something for hardware RAIDs in which two different
RAID controllers can get to the same logical unit, but you pay a performance
penalty when you access the lun via both controllers?  It seems to me that
all RAIDs that don't require a command to switch a lun from one to the
other controller (i.e. where both ctlrs can access a lun simultaneously)
pay a performance penalty when you access a lun from both.
Working around this in a generic way (i.e. without designation by the
system admin) seems difficult, so I'm wondering what may have been done
with this (my reading of this discussion is that it has not been tackled
yet).
thanks
