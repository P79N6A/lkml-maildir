Actually, it will solve half of your problem, because it is generally faster,
reading only snapsize from kernel. On loopback it allows also to filter out
outgoing frames (f.e. with option "-b ip"): multiply rates by 2.
Certainly, it is not enough fast to handle enough high ppses,
but, seems, I will finish "turbo" capture soon, it is good work to relax. 8)
