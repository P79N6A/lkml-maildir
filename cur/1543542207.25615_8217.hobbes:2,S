bdflush on 2.4 still uses wake_up_process, but Ingo said that kernel
threads should use waitqueues instead. We have a thread similar in
functionality to bdflush, but more suited to our needs, called jflush.
We use wake_up_process. Since the only documentation available for Linux
is typically the source, we thought this was the way to go. According to
Ingo, it's not. He has not eleborated.
Can some tell me the pros and cons of wake_up_process vs. waitqueues?
Also, will bdflush ("the documentation") be updated?
Thanks!
