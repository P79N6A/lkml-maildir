I'm not quite sure what your point is.  The paragraph you quoted is
pretty explicit in saying that volatile doesn't prevent an "asm
volatile" from being interspersed with other code, and the example just
before that is explicit in talking about how to use dependencies to
control the ordering of asm volatiles with respect to surrounding code. 
In fact nothing in that section precludes asm volatiles from being
reordered with respect to each other either; you just have to make sure
your dependency constraints are all correct.
