I'm not satisfied with Nick's patch because it defines FIRST_USER_ADDRESS
as FIRST_USER_PGD_NR * PGDIR_SIZE i.e. 2MB.  And if that is the first
user address, then there is no need for his patch, because the new
free_pgtables will never touch that pgd because there's no vma in it.
That's why I thought arm needed no special code for this
(overlooking the nr_ptes bug issue, sorry).
But above you say FIRST_USER_ADDRESS should actually be 0x8000?
In that case, I think we should define FIRST_USER_ADDRESS to 0,
either in every asm-arch or in asm-generic, with arm overriding
it to 0x8000 - or better, to whatever #define you already have
for that 0x8000, but I didn't find it.
If vmas can occur in between 0x8000 and 2MB, then with Nick's patch
we'd be liable to pass free_pgtables a vma with vm_start lower than
floor, which is not a case I've thought through, nor wish to.
And, whether FIRST_USER_ADDRESS is 0x8000 or 2MB,
shouldn't your arch_get_unmapped_area be enforcing it?
