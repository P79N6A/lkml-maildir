: Just how smart have they made this optimisation, BTW? For the volume
: rendering application, you have two conceptual transfers of data: the
: volume data is "shipped" to worker nodes and they in turn "ship"
: subimage data back to the scheduling node.
If I recall correctly, they actually wacked the OS.  They used /proc
and made a way that another process could map a different process'
address space.  Sends can be implemented, on page sized quantities,
as mapping a page COW into another process' address space.
Zero copy for big data that wasn't touched, otherwise copy on write.
For small data, it was just a copy and a wakeup.
I may have the details wrong, but the bottom line was that MPI went 
very, very fast - customers were quite amazed and very pleased.  It
exceeded their expectations.
