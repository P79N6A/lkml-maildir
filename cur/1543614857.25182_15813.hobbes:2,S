I beg pardon but before strating to fight problems, it is necessary
to force kernel to prepare something different of linear skbs. :-)
What's about checksumming? Do you plan to ignore it?

I see no connection between "cpu locality" and frgamtn hadling at all.

In stock kernels: _never_. Packets are not defragmented by routers,
and netfilter linearizes everything in any case.
Anyway, if the driver is able to provide some facility, why not to do this?

Yes.
Which means that the task is not so sexy. :-)
