I very specifically didn't address that point as I don't have anything
constructive to say there. All I said about that was that the
capabilities were validated against some trusted source, which they
have to be for the idea of capabilities to make any sense.
 > "Yes, this file contains a legal capabilities header, so I'll

I'm in full agreement with that. What I proposed was no more than the
procedure to be followed to ensure that security hacks didn't get by
the validation procedure when an old kernel needed to be used for some
reason. I thought I made that clear in my first post on the subject...
For reference, I recently had to make use of the 2.0.27 kernel that
came with RedHat 4.1 on one of my systems to deal with a problem that
had occurred, as neither the 2.2.4 kernel that machine normally uses,
nor the 2.0.36 kernel used prior to that and still on the system,
could handle the new network card I installed to replace a failed one,
and I had no other means of getting an updated 2.2.4 kernel on the
machine in question.
As a result, I have NO problem with the idea of having to boot an old
kernel on occasion to deal with some problem that can't be handled any
other way, and will therefore dismiss ANY argument against the idea
without further comment...

That _how_ is ALSO a capability in any meaningful interpretation of
the word, and that capability is stored in the file itself.
My point here is that whilst there are some capabilities that can ONLY
be stored in the file system metadata, there are also others that can
only be sensibly stored in the file itself, and yet others that could
be stored in either place. I most definately don't agree with your
claim that all capabilities must be stored in the metadata, and you'll
never persuade me that such is the case.
For example, where would you find the following capabilities?
 1. Permission to execute the file [metadata]
    Linux and all versions of MS-DOS both put this in the metadata,
    Linux in the file's mode, MS-DOS in the file's extension.
 2. How to load a file for execution [either]
    Linux puts it in the file header, MS-DOS 2.xx put it in the
    metadata (specifically whether the file's extension was BAT (a
    shell script), COM (a memory image) or EXE (a loadable image),
    and MS-DOS 3.xx and later used a combination where files with
    a BAT extension were shell scripts, and files with either COM
    or EXE extensions had their contents checked for whether they
    were memory images or loadable images.
 3. How to display a web page [file]
    Are any comments needed regarding this one?
Perhaps that explains my position somewhat better than my previous
posts did?

Same difference - it refuses to execute it either way. I could equally
well have created a binary data file with the 'x' bit set to make the
same point...

Precicely my point: PERL scripts (any scripts, come to that) can't be
written to encode securrity capabilities within them in a secure way.
The same is true of s[gu]id scripts, and I regard the fact that PERL
scripts can meaningfully gain s[gu]id priviledges as a MIS-FEATURE -
in fact, I'd go so far as to call it a BUG !!!

Whilst that's basically true, it's also true that they are rarely
correct the first time round, and for that reason, whatever method is
used to implement them MUST work in PARALLEL with the existing system
until it has been proven to be better than the existing system, and
only then can the existing system be dropped...

So far, there haven't been any schemes vented here, only suggestions
as to how various aspects of the finished design could be implemented.
I've designed enough things in my time to know that a brainstorming
session like that is an ESSENTIAL prerequisite for a solid design, and
for that reason, I believe that ALL suggestions should be WELCOMED, as
should CONSTRUCTIVE criticism of the suggestions made. However,
DESTRUCTIVE criticism (such as yours) of the suggestions made is to be
AVOIDED as it only ever results in a flawed design due to necessary
points not being raised during the brainstorming session.
Yes, there will be a lot of suggestions that don't make it into the
final design at all, and there will be others that don't make it into
the final design in the form they were made. However, the final design
will be much more mature and solid after such a brainstorming session
since points the authors would never have thought of will be raised
and considered as a result of it.

So far, there isn't even a full list of the capabilities that need to
be present,

Who's suggested that it should be able to? Not me, for sure.
My claim is that the backup tools do not need to have any special
capabilities to do their job on the files they have permission to
access, and I stand by that claim. If you've any sense, so will you.

What on earth for? It's the kernel's job to check security, not the
backup tool's job.

Nope, just that I don't see the logic behind advertising places where
crackers can have an easy time on a public mailing list such as this.
If you wish me to show you SEVERAL systems which match your comment
above, let me know when you'll be in Aberdeen and I'll meet you and
take you to the systems in question, but I will NOT advertise them in
public in the way you suggested. For any price.
Best wishes from Riley.
