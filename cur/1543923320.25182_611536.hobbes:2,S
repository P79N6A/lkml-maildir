moving kernel/profile.c to instrumentation/profile.c should be done
through a git mv. Moving the Makefile lines should be done through a
patch.
But since I use quilt to manage my patchset, I guess I don't have this
ability. Should I switch to git to perform this change to make
everyone's life easier or should I simply ask kindly for maintainers to
perform git mv in their tree ?
