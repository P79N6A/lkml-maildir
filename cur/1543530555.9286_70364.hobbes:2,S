Subject: [patch-2.3.99pre1] Assembler Warnings in head.S

Hi everyone,
I got these warnings when compiling 2.3.99pre1 for i386 on a UP machine:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/kernel/linux-test/include -DCPU=686 -traditional
-c head.S
/tmp/ccHQoVuB.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/ccHQoVuB.s:112: Warning: using `%eax' instead of `%ax' due to `l' suffix
/tmp/ccHQoVuB.s:113: Warning: using `%eax' instead of `%ax' due to `l' suffix
/tmp/ccHQoVuB.s:114: Warning: using `%eax' instead of `%ax' due to `l' suffix
/tmp/ccHQoVuB.s:115: Warning: using `%eax' instead of `%ax' due to `l' suffix
The problem seemed simple enough to fix (the patch is included below). It
seems to work for me and simply does what gcc (2.95.2) said it would do.
Comments?
