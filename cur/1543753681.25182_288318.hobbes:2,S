Hi,
I haven't tried any earlier kernel. Problem exists with 2.6.10 and 
2.6.11-rc1.  System seems to suspend ok. When I press the power button 
the fans turn on again, the IDE LED seems to flash a little and then 
stays on permanently. System hangs. Display is still off, so I don't 
know if there are any kernel messages. All I can do is hit the Reset 
button. S1 works fine.
Under WinXP S3 works.
Does anyone see the same problem ?
