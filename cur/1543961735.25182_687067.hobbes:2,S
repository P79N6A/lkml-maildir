I kept the if() syntax but used cgroup_subsys_state as suggested. I kept
the name "dummy" too to emphasize that except for following the
currently-required form we don't really need the state information.
As a side note, I don't think adding state (which signal was/to
sent/send) or a fork handling function prevents races. I tend to agree
that there are lots of races involving adding/removing tasks to the
cgroup where we may not signal "everything". I think that from
userspace's perspective we can't solve the races because there will
always be a window between releasing whatever lock we use and returning
to userspace where new tasks can be added.
IMHO the only way to prevent such races would be to allow userspace to
"lock" a cgroup so that no new tasks may be added. That would block/fail
new forks and prevent writing new pids to the tasks file. Otherwise
userspace must always recheck the list to ensure it didn't get any new
entries...

Removed.

send_sig() -> send_sig_info() hold the tasklist_lock for read and the
task's sighand->siglock spinlock.

OK.
