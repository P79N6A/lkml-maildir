Initial patch (against 2.4.2-ac20) is available at

Tomorrow I'll take a look at the various ->nopage
functions and do_swap_page to see if these functions
would be able to take simultaneous faults at the same
address (from multiple threads).  If not, either we'll
need to modify these functions, or we could add a (few?)
extra lock to prevent these functions from faulting at
the same address at the same time in multiple threads.

Rik
