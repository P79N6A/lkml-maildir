    Wouldn't it make more sense to use a logical naming scheme
Yes.
            stable-1996
            unstable-1996
How inconvenient. The names are too long, and moreover,
it is easier to talk about versions than about years.
I recall the 0.99pl8 times, but was it 1993? Would
have to check. There is no guarantee about a nice matching
between kernel versions and years.
How to name 1.0.*? Well, just 1.0.
And if some silly identifier restriction wants a starting letter,
or no periods, then a transformation like v1.0 or v1_0 would do.
