Rubbish. Only a subset of monitors do that. And what's worse, just
because my belinea 10-70-95 seems to ignore invalid signals *most of the
time*, you can fry it within 6 seconds by switching from 1600x1200x70 to
320x200x50 and back with exactly the right timing. Can easily be done with
xfree, as I have shown repeatedly. A lot of monitors are designed that
poorly.
You mustn't generalize from "my monitor is sane" to "every monitor is sane".
And there is _no_ way to verify this.

Again, the OS cannot decide that. Besides, "flash new firmware" *is* a
valid command for the drive.
Besides, almost every new invention started as a "non-standard"
extension. Linux shouldn't mindlessly inhibit innovation.
