Hi folks,
I've got a mysterious effect breaking mkinitrd on my PC:
Even though sata_sil has been used to mount the root
partition, there is no /proc/scsi/sata_sil. But on
another PC, booting via aic7xxx, there is a
/proc/scsi/aic7xxx.
I should mention that sata_sil is a module, while aic7xxx
has been compiled into the kernel. But should this make
a difference?
Regards
Harri
