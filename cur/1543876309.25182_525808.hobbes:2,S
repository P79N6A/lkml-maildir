What new hook?  The hook has been there for sometime, and now we are 
using it to fix a bug.  I do not want to touch generic or arch code at 
this point in the 2.6.21 release.

Yes, but if I don't touch arch code, I won't even affect native.  I do 
not want to risk any instability, despite how easy it would be to do 
what you and others have asked, I don't think it is appropriate at -rc5 
stage.
