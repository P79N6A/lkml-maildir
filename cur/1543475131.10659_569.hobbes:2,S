Hi Thomas,
This is just for your information; you don't have to do anything.
I started looking into your xconfig bug report.  It reproduces just fine
with "make ARCH=alpha xconfig" on my system.  I don't have a patch yet,
but here is a progress report with graphic detail.
This menu is the 'QoS and/or fair queueing' menu.  I dumped the
arch/alpha/config.in parse tree and I saw the following structure:
  if [ "$CONFIG_NET" = "y" ]; then
    MENU 'Networking options'
      ...
      tristate 'Appletalk DDP' CONFIG_ATALK
      if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
        ...
	if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
	  MENU 'QoS and/or fair queueing'
	  ...
	  endmenu
Note the repetition of CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.  My parse dumper doesn't
list file names, but this is in net/Config.in.
scripts/tkcond.c has special handling for repeated conditionals.  In the
generated tcl code, it looks like tkparse blew it and skipped *both*
conditionals when it generated the global/vfix declarations.  That
leads to the syntax error you see.
I am going to continue looking into this.  The obvious kludge is to
take out the inner CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, which is redundant.  But I would
rather fix xconfig.
I will also guess that the bug started manifesting in 2.2.0-pre2, with
the addition of the innermost 'QoS and/or fair queuing' menu.  The buggy
generated code is in the top-level menu refresh function.  So before
that new menu, the bug didn't manifest like this; it probably never
manifested at all.
Something I don't understand: why the bug manifests on alpha, but not
on i386.  net/Config.in is machine-independent and the parse tree looks
the same for this part on both architectures.
Anyways, I'm working on this, that's the story so far, and I will probably
have a patch ready for testing soon.
Regards,
Michael Elizabeth Chastain
