Hi,
	For using kdb I have done the following:
	1) upgrade modutils using modutils-2.3.11-1.i386.rpm
	2) patched the source using kdb-v0.6-2.2.13 as I am using
	   linux-2.2.16.(I don't know, this kdb for 2.2.13 works for
	   linux-2.2.16, I haven't used it extensively, so don't know 
	   whether it works correctly or not?, but I couldn't find kdb
	   for 2.2.16 in SGI site, any clues in this is very much 
	   welcomed  :))
	so this works ... , 
	But if I want to debug the modules, set breakpoints at, see the
	address of, module functions, what shall I have to do? I haven't 
	found any clue on this as yet, Plz. help..
