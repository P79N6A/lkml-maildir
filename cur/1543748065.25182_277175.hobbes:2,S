Subject: Recent select() handling change breaks Poptop

The recent changeset [1] dealing with blocking usage of select() seems
to break the Poptop PPTP server.
After upgrading from -rc2 to -rc3, I could no longer connect to a server
running PopTop.  Ended up reverting various -bk snapshots, and the breakage
was between -bk13 and -bk14.  Reverting this change to af_inet:
-       .poll =         datagram_poll,
+       .poll =         udp_poll,
makes the Poptop server work again.
Any ideas?
Phil
