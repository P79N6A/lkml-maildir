Hm, no.  As nothing can be proven to be broken right now, it's way too
late to get any change like this into 2.6.16-final.  Especially as your
patch series broke Andrew's laptop :)
If you want to respin them once that problem is fixed, I'd be glad to
take them for 2.6.17, as long as we can get some agreement here on the
interface.
thanks,
