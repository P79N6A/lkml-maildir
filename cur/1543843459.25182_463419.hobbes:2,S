Looks MUCH better to me, and eliminates my objection to the 
libata-related hooks.
There remains the issue that I poke James about on IRC, namely that 
there is no need to emulate the SATA phy registers.  libata permits a 
driver high level access to the ATA engine without needing SATA SCRs. 
Witness all the PATA drivers, which obviously do not have SCRs at all.
