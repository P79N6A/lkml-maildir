To whom it may concert
Attached is a report generated by ksymoops for a Oops Crash that can be
repeated on my system on a very regular basis.
Here is how the Kernel has been change from the Standard (Using RedHat
Linux Version 6.0 [Kernel 2.2.5-15]).
1) Patched the Kernel with bigphysarea-patch for Kernel Version 2.2.5
2) Modified the Kernel to include the following as part of the kernel
     Kernel IDE ATAPI Tape Support
     Kernel support for Adaptek AIC7XXX Controller
     Kernel support for 3C509 Ethernet Controller
     Kernel is set for loadable modules support.
     No Sound Driver support
     Sound Driver is purchased from Opensource.com. Using SoundBlaster
PCI128 Card
     Also include metero-1.5.4 Driver for the Matrix Meteor Card (as
loadable module)
     All drives are SCSI drives.
Error seems to be related to capturing audio using RealNetworks
raencoder V3.0.  Have modified the audio capture to RealProducerG2 Plus
with similar results.
If there is no audio capture there is no system panic.  Crash happen
after approximately 45-60 minutes of continuous audio capture.
I hope the attached information will help.  If the problem is related to
the Audio System I would be happy to replace the Opensound Driver with
the ones that come with the regular Linux system.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Thanks for all the good work.

Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.5-15/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
