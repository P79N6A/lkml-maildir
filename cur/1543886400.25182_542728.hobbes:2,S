If I well understand doing like this means that I have to modify also
userland API, is that true?
I know that you are forcing in using this new interface for new kernel
projects, but if I have to change my code I need also change NTPD
related code and this is frustrating. I have to interact with both
kernel developers and NTPD ones... :)
It could be acceptable let me use id "20" (or just another number) to
allow Andrew Morton and other LinuxPPS users to test this new support?
Please, consider that this is not a new project, it was developed
since 2005 when this new interface was not available.
Thanks for your attention,
Rodolfo
