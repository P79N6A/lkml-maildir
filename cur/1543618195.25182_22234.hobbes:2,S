Subject: [PATCH] fix drivers/scsi/imm.c in 2.5.3pre2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/1/22/11

I've finally got the imm driver to work.  I have based this patch a patch 
posted by derek@signalmarketing.com for the ppa driver.  I've tested this and 
it works for me.  Please test this and send me any questions or comments you 
may have.  If no one has any problems I'll send it to Linus.
Also, I have a longer patch that gets rid of some #includes in imm.c that are 
also in imm.h.  I moved them to imm.h.  Let me know if I should post that 
patch as well.  It is mainly cosmetic and also works for me.
Thanks,
Rich
