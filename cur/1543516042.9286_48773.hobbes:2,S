Yes. But this is what I have found on some Gateway Pentiums:
If I access a device that is below 1 megabyte, using a flat-mode
(32-bits, starting at 0), segment descriptor, the "below 1 megbyte"
address bit, that some use to save bits in the decode, is active so
such a device can be accessed. However, if I access it through Linux's
segment descriptor, this bit is not set. This means that boards that
use this bit in the decode are invisible to Linux unless seen though
a segment descriptor that gives 1:1 virtual to physical mapping.
This invisibility is strange because the MMU is supposed to translate
to physical regardless of how it was generated.
Cheers,
