	At older Laser and TurboLaser multiprocessor systems
	all CPUs seem to be running at same clock, or one which
	is in PLL lock to some system wide distributed reference.
	See DEC Technical Journal stories about 4100 system.

	I have never heard of actual instances of multiprocessor systems
	where processors run at different clock speeds, even if that were
	technically possible by decoupling CPU internal operations, and
	external system bus.
