Ok. Do you have the full trace? In particular, if there is no locking in 
that path, and interrupts are enabled, you could possibly get not just an 
interrupt, but a preemption event. Now _that_ could blow up the timeout to 
any amount of time, and then even 100ms might not be enough.
Is CONFIG_PREEMPT on in the cases, and is there really no locking 
anywhere? Preempting in the middle of the data transfer phase sounds like 
a fundamentally bad idea, and maybe the code needs a few preempt 
disable/enable pairs somewhere?
