This is exactly what I was looking at doing, looks like most of the work
is done.  I have some concerns about the actual algorithm used for
changing the CPU frequency (20%/80%), but this of course can be tuned.
I suspect that CPUs that have the capability of changing frequency
themselves would not use this particular governor.
You may want to make the sampling rate configurable at run time.
