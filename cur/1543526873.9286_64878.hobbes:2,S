OpenBIOS:  
http://www.freiburg.linux.de/openbios/
Status:  machine init, no BIOS interrupt support
LinusBIOS:  
http://www.acl.lanl.gov/linuxbios/
Status:  loads Linux on L440GX, not sufficient as a standalone BIOS
And source code for Via's Award BIOS, albeit with "trade secret" stamped
all over it, is still sitting in a public area on their FTP site: 
ftp://ftp.via.com.tw/public/sw/

	Jeff
