What Con said.  When the scheduler makes an inappropriate decision,
shortening the timeslice minimises its impact.

I disabled the estimator first.  The result was amazingly bad ;)

Yup.  One good test is to keep rebuilding a kernel all the time,
then just *use* the system.  Setting max_timeslice=10, prio_bonus=10
works better still.  prio_bonus=25 has small-but-odd lags.

prio_bonus=0, max_timeslice=300 is awful.  Try it...

hm.  Good luck ;)
This is a situation in which one is prepares to throw away some cycles
to achieve a desired effect.
