You should not blindly add the extra one, you should check if usec == 0
first.
Maybe your way is more correct, but my way is more useful. Suppose
you want generate a stream of UDP packets with 10 ms second length
of voice, in this case it is not very inportant if you occasionally
send a packet too fast or to slow, so I can do it like this,
	while (1) {
		send a packet;
		usleep(10000);
	}
But if use your approach, I have to rely on some other trick, like
increasing
HZ, using itimer signal or using the RTC driver.
I think the best way is to schedule for the minimun timeout, when wakeup
check to see if the timeout is really expired, if not then scheduling
for  the one extra jiffie.
