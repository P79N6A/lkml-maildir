Hi,
I have problems using the wireless card on my laptop.
It uses the acx100sta chipset :-(. But thats not the problem.
Every time I insert the card the kernel prints out a message
saying kernel unable to handle paging request. And if I try to
remove the card the system hangs. For the card I'm using the yenta_socket
module in the kernel.The i82365 module does not work. This isnt a driver
problem, because I havent even loaded the drivers.(i actually dont have
'em for this kernel)
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Anoop
