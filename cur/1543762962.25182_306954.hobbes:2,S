In the United States there is something called "restraint of trade".
Suppose there was a long-time facility or API that got replaced
with one that was highly restrictive. To use the new facility, one
would have to buy a license or kiss somebody or something that
was not previously required. If an action was brought against the
person(s) who replaced the old facility with the new one, it
is likely that the plaintiff would prevail.
If there is documented proof that those symbols were previously
available and then they were changed to something more restrictive,
I think one would prevail if a complaint were brought in court.
If course, you need to convince the person(s) who changed them
that the action was unconscionable and therefore force them to
change them back without making money for the lawyers by suing
them. And, yes, somebody who modifies software in that manner
can be sued. They could also be charged with criminal behavior
(malicious mischief) in the State of Massachusetts or charged
under federal law with restraint of trade. Modifying an existing
policy to further an individual's ambitions can be fraught
with consequences.
