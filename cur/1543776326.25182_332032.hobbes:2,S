I'm a little confused.  How is this different from the ACPI CPU throttling
  states (/proc/acpi/processor/CPUn/limit to set, throttling to see all
  T-states available)?
On my 1.5-year-old Pentium-M, frequency scaling and T-states are different
  beasties, and act entirely differently.  I'm currently in the process of
  rewriting my governor's brain to deal with the two more intelligently.
