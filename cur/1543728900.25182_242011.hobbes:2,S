On August 12 and 13, one of the worst typhoons to hit China in several years killed 115 people and injured more 
than 1,800 when it battered southeastern Zhejiang province with torrential rain and gale-force winds, officials said 
on Friday. Direct economic losses were estimated at $1.85 billion and 677,500 acres of crops had been damaged, 
the Civil Affairs Ministry said. 
More than 8.6 million people had been affected by the storm, officials said.
The death toll was likely to rise as the typhoon swept inland into eastern Jiangxi province, officials said.
"This is the strongest typhoon since 1997," said an official of the Provincial Civil Affairs Bureau, China. In 1997, 
nearly 250 people died when typhoon Winnie struck the coast, causing $2.4 billion in economic losses.
"Lots of trees and electricity pylons were toppled." Rananim brought torrential rains and winds exceeding 100 mph. 
The eye of the storm made landfall at about 8 p.m. on Thursday near the town of Wenling.
"Shop signboards were flying out and hit people's arms and legs like knives," said a doctor at the No.1 People's 
Hospital in Wenling City. "The wind was really very, very strong and we have rarely seen this." Some of those in 
hospital were in critical condition, he said.
Mud flows, landslides and storm tides along the coast were all dangers, Xinhua quoted Gao Shuanzhu, Chief 
Forecaster at the Central Meteorological Station, as saying.
Typhoon Rananim hit the coast late on Thursday, leaving 16 people missing, causing widespread damage in the 
rice-growing province and knocking down more than 40,000 buildings, said an official of the provincial meteorological 
bureau.
