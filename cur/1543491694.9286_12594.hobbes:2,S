A Solaris 2.5.1 application can't get a file lock on my new 2.2.3 system.
Here's the relevent piece of truss output on the Solaris box:
8127:   access("/u/jtst/j.gws", 0)                      = 0
8127:   uname(0xEFFFD738)                               = 1
8127:   open("highlight_dash", O_RDONLY)                Err#2 ENOENT
8127:   open("highlight_dash", O_RDONLY)                Err#2 ENOENT
8127:   stat("/u/jtst/j.gws", 0xEFFFE220)               = 0
8127:   open("/u/jtst/j.gws", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 8
8127:   fstat(8, 0xEFFFE220)                            = 0
8127:   fcntl(8, F_SETLK, 0xEFFFE284)                   Err#46 ENOLCK
the man page for fcntl() says that ENOLCK  means "Too many segment locks
are open, lock table is full.  Can someone tell me what might be causing
this?  More generally, is there somewhere I can look for an overview of
linux file locking?  
Thanks for your time,
