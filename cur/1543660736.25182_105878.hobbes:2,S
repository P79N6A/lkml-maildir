Well, actually the ISA stuff *is* related to PCI bus on everything
newer than 486 PCs as it's connected to PCI via PCI-to-ISA bridge.
Even worse, I've found that at least two vendors offer PCI-to-ISA
expansion systems (yes, these systems are limited to IO only
on PCs because it clashes with another ISA bus in the same PCI domain),
but this means that one can have multiple ISA busses on alpha, parisc,
sparc64, ppc etc. One ISA bus per PCI IO domain. Shudder...

The problem is that vgacon driver is special - is starts very early,
before PCI subsystem is probed and initialized. So we don't have pci_bus
at this point.
