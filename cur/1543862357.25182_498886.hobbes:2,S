Subject: [patch 00/20] XEN-paravirt: Xen guest implementation for paravirt_ops interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch series implements the Linux Xen guest in terms of the
paravirt-ops interface.  The features in implemented this patch series
are:
 * domU only
 * UP only (most code is SMP-safe, but there's no way to create a new vcpu)
 * writable pagetables, with late pinning/early unpinning
   (no shadow pagetable support)
 * supports both PAE and non-PAE modes
 * xen console
 * virtual block device (blockfront)
(Netfront needs a bit of updating, and will be in a separate patch later.)
The patch series is in two parts:
1-11: cleanups to the core kernel, either to fix outright problems,
      or to add appropriate hooks for Xen
12-20: the Xen guest implementation itself
I've tried to make each patch as self-explanatory as possible.  The
series is based on 2.6.20-rc4-mm1.
Thanks,
	J
