Put it that way:
	* if ->read_super() decides to fail, it should evict all inodes
it had put into icache.
	* if ->put_super() does any iput(), it should take care to evict
that inode from icache.
IOW,
	* if we do iput() while we are outside of (success of ->read_super(),
call of ->put_super()) - we want that inode to be evicted ASAP.
Which is precisely what 2.4.15+patch does.
