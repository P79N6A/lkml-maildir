Patches in the 2.3.18ac series enable MMX routines for the K7.  Code
comments state that these routines are a win on K6-III, and I think
possibly the K6-II as well.  It is definitely useful to enable
CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW and -march=k6 on the K6 series, but doing so
requires separating the K6 option from the PentiumTSC option.
