I've long wanted to have "flags" system calls, because I hate ioctl's with
a passion. However, nobody was bothered enough by it to actually implement
it..

No, just make it do
	{l,f,}chflags({name,fd,name}, u32 *old, u32 *new);
and then you can read and write the flags with just one system call. I do
not want to extend on stat() yet again.
