Please just make a proper patch - either add a call to it to all setup_archs,
or add a call to before setup_arch in init/main.c. While such ifdefs
for specific architecture hacks are more popular lately it doesn't mean they are a good idea.
I hope there aren't any existing architectures that use it in the middle
of setup_arch or rely on it being after setup_arch.
