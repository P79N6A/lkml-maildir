Which has some potentially fatal consequences, really, if any of the
capture code gets paged out before the streaming write starts, or if the
filesystem needs to read a bitmap block or so, as Rik points out.

Would you consider allowing something akin to 'writes_starved = -4' to
allow writes to bypass reads only 4 times -- a preference for writes,
but not forever?
That's going to express the bias I (think I) want for this case, but
it's not going to be able to stall a read forever...

from a typical Usenet posting is sufficient to provide a state space so vast
that all the computation power in the world can not conquer it.
