For the embedded world, initramfs has pretty much rendered initrd obsolete, 
and that was the biggest user of the ramdisk code I know of.  Beyond that, 
loopback mounts give you more flexible transient block devices than ramdisks 
do.  (In fact, ramdisks are such an amazing pain to use/size/free that if I 
really needed something like that I'd just make a loopback mount in a ramfs 
instance.)
Embedded users who still want a block interface for memory are generally 
trying to use a cramfs or squashfs image out of ROM or flash, although there 
are flash-specific filesystems for this and I dunno if they're actually 
mounting /dev/mem at an offset or something (md?  losetup -o?  Beats me, I 
haven't tried that myself yet...)
