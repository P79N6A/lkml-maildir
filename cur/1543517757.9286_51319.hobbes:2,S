Hi Guys,
I am new to SMP programming, so I have some questions about SMP 
support under linux, both in the kernel and for user land processes. 
Specifically I am wondering if there is the ability to implement the 
following functions for user land apps:
      getCPUs() - returns the number of CPUs in system. 
      setCPU() - ensures that all subsequently executed 
        code will run on a given CPU - for the current 
        thread. 
This would allow user land apps to ensure code runs on a single 
processor for a short period of time. Is that possible at all?
I assume something like this must be possible in the Linux kernel, 
and if so what are the functions used to do this?
Please reply via email to keep the volume down on this list.
Regards,
