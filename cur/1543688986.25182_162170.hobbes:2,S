What happens after this sequence:
	1. process A forks, making process B
	2. B does FUTEX_FD, or splits into threads and one does FUTEX_WAIT,
	   on a private page that has not been written to since the fork
	3. A does FUTEX_WAIT on the same address
	3. The page is swapped out
	4. B does FUTEX_WAKE at the same address
Won't the futex be hashed on the swap entry at step 4, so that
both processes are woken, yet only the waiter in B should be woken?
Related: could COW sharing after fork() explain the spurious wakeups I
saw mentioned earlier in the thread?
