This thingie is nice for embedded use, where you need a webserver
for some stuff, but don't wan't to include one, because you need
it only to represent some machine values of a process
computer[1].
But we need a more generic one, which has the functionality of a
read only entry of /proc.
That would be _very_ useful.
