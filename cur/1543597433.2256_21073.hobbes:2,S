Umm that is very interesting - I was rather sure there were some problems
a while ago (2.2.x ?). Is there anything special necessary to use large
files ? Because I tried to create a 3+gig file and now I cannot ls or rm
it. (More details: the file was created using dd from block device (tried
to backup a smaller ext2 partition), ls and rm say  "Value too large for
defined data type" and I upgraded everything mentioned in Documentation/Changes).

PS Yep, the new limits are clearly documented in
Documentation/filesystems/ext2.txt - sorry for bothering anyone..
