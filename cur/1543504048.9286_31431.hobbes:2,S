 I always thought that an open source "Geek Card", with decent OS support
would rock. Give the gimp access to a PCI card with 32MB of RAM, an FPGA
and a decent DSP, and it would fly...imagine plugins that load a gate
description for accelerating dithering to the FPGA, and then DMAs an image
to it. While it's there, you could be using it for seti@home, bzip2,
whatever has been written to use it...hmm ?
 No need to port Linux to a DSP, to make advantage of it...just provide a
half decent API for it...
