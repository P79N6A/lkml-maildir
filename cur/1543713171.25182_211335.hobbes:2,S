It's OK to do that, so long as 'stat' and 'fstat' truncate the
user-visible time stamps to the resolution of the filesystem.  This
shouldn't cost much.

Would it be easy to add one?  For example, we might extend pathconf so
that pathconf(filename, _PC_MTIME_DELTA) returns the file system's
mtime stamp resolution in nanoseconds.
I write "mtime" because I understand that some Microsoft file systems
use different resolutions for mtime versus ctime versus atime, and
mtime resolution is all that I need for now.  Also, the NFSv3 protocol
supports a delta quantity that tells the NFS client the mtime
resolution on the NFS server, so if you assume NFSv3 or better the
time stamp resolution is known for remote servers too.

Ouch.  Then it sounds like there's no easy workaround for existing
systems.  Still it'd be nice to fix the bug for future systems.
