Reported this earlier as a 3c509 card in error, should
have been 3c900 (3c59x driver).
FYI:
  Single 3c900 card, UP i386
  Lost networking with .16-git12, message
  ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready
  Had several of these with git11
  NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
  No problems observed git1-git10
