Interesting.
We ultimately rejected a similar patch to xfs_repair (pre-population
the kernel block device cache) mainly because of low memory
performance issues and it doesn't really enable you to do anything
particularly smart with optimising I/O patterns for larger, high
performance RAID arrays.
The low memory problems were particularly bad; the readahead
thrashing cause a slowdown of 2-3x compared to the baseline and
often it was due to the repair process requiring all of memory
to cache stuff it would need later. IIRC, multi-terabyte ext3
filesystems have similar memory usage problems to XFS, so there's
a good chance that this patch will see the same sorts of issues.

Promising results, though....
Cheers,
Dave.
