I ran into something like this last night with an ethernet card while helping
a person install RH 6.1.  I learned a lot :-)  In particular go into your
BIOS an tell it that you do NOT have a plug-n-play aware BIOS and see if that
fixes your problem.
On our system, when the BIOS thought the OS was plug-n-play aware, it did
not assign IRQs.  Our 3c905 ethernet card got an IRQ of 0 and promptly hung
the machine when it tried to talk to the DHCP server.  Of course hanging the
machine keeps the irq 0 message from being logged to syslog, so it took us
a few hours to figure out what was going on.  Hopefully this will save you
those few hours.
Hope this helps,
Jim
