Subject: [GIT PULL] ext4 updates for 2.6.29
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus,
Please pull from:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git for_linus
This contains lots of cleanups as well as various bug fixes, some of
which will also need to included in the 2.6.28.x stable tree.  There are
also some performance improvements, such as Josef Bacik fsync batching,
and also of note Frank Mayhar from Google's extensions which allow ext4
to run without a journal.  (This way, if you are using aggressively
replicated filesets, and you want the performance improvements of ext4
--- extents, delayed allocation, et. al --- you can get it without the
overhead of the journal.  This is useful if your recovery mechanism on
an unclean shutdown is to mkfs the filesystem and recover it from one of
the other backup copies of the filesystem.  :-)   Finally, we have some
robustification patches which prevent ext4 from oops when given a
corrupted filesystem image.
Thanks!!
