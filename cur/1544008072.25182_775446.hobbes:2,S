It can't be secure. So what's the point to emulate the domain
partitioning in many traditional hardware IOMMUs that doesn't support
it.
The emulated domain support with the DMA mapping debugging feature
might be useful to debug drivers but it doesn't mean that we need to
add the emulated domain support to every hardware IOMMU. If you add it
to swiotlb, everyone can enjoy the debugging.
