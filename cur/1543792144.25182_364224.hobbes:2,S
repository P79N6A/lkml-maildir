On git2 and git7 (and probably also git9) we die on Matti's machine
because we fall back to gart with no_iommu set when we find we don't
have an IOMMU in init_k8gatt(). That causes to a panic when we try to
DMA above 4GB due to the USB controller being only 32-bit-DMA
capable.
I think that the right thing to do at that point is fall back to
swiotlb[0]. Now, We could theoretically switch to swiotlb in
pci_iommu_init() when init_k8_gatt() fails, but at that point it's too
late to call swiotlb_init() (it causes a crash in the bootmem
allocator in my tests). That leaves the following options:
- realize earlier, when we can still call the standard swiotlb_init()
that we are going to need it (is this possible?)
- switch to having our own swiotlb_init() which relies on either
GPF_DMA32 or allocating the swiotlb scratch space statically in
vmlinux (thanks Arjan), and use it when init_k8_gatt() fails.
- call swiotb_init() unconditionally in mem_init(), and free it later
if we don't need it.
Thoughts?
As a side note, none of this is related to my dma_ops patch - we die
on Matti's machine the same way with and without it and we can fix it
roughly the same way with and without it. I do think the dma_ops patch
makes the potential fixes cleaner, though.
[0] Matti machine dies at the moment even with swiotlb=soft. I think
that's a seperate, orthogonal bug.
Cheers,
Muli
