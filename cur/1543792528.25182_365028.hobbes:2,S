Why is this initialized?

Why do this? it always returns zero.

RETURN VALUE
   Upon successful completion, lseek returns the resulting offset
   location as measured in bytes from the beginning of the  file.
   Otherwise,  a  value  of  (off_t)-1 is returned and errno is
   set to indicate the error.
