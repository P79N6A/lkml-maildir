Actually we could do the same thing they did for errno, i.e.
#define jiffies get_jiffies()
extern unsigned get_jiffies(void);

No, not really.  HZ still defines the units of jiffies and most all the
timing is still related to it.  Its just that interrupts are only "set
up" when a "real" time event is due.
