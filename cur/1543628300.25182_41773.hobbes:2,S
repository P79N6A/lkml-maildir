Not on bkbits.net.  It eats up too much bandwidth.  If someone else wants
to host a bkbits.net mirror and they want to allow that, then I'll add
the code.
It actually doesn't do you that much good unless we add an interface to
get the pre-patch style diffs.  Otherwise you are getting a cset at a 
time and that's a bit too fine grained, at least I think it is.
