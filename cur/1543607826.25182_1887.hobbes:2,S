   There is a correct way to do this optimization.  If you're enough
   of an asshole to not care about doing it that way, great!
Doing range flushes is not the answer.   It is going to be about
the same cost as doing per-page flushes.
The cost is doing the cross calls at all, not the granularity in which
we do them.
You're refusing to do any work to prove whether your case matters
at all in real life, and you're calling other people assholes for
asking that you do so.
Franks a lot,
