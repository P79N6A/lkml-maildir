Please check the archive: My original complaint was about the
inconsistency between /proc/modules listing all modules with '_',
and the module filenames using both '-' and '_'. For me it is
not important which version is better. As a developer I have to
assume that '_' and '-' are ambiguous in this context. This
ambiguity is pretty strange for Unix, isn't it?
