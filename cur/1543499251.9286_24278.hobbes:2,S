Stephen,
do you think that a per-block-device IO scheduling will cure the 
70-150ms stall of audio playing applications during heavy disk I/O ?
Just for curiousity , will it take much time to implement the
per-device scheduling on Linux ?
will future 2.3.x series have these features ?
Do you think that we could archieve similar low scheduling latencies
as with microkerneled OSes (like BeOS)  , or is this a design implementation
of monolithic kernels ?
From what I heard IRIX is able to handle RT scheuled processes
with deadlines of 1ms even under high load, and IRIX is monolithic.
(correct me if I'm wrong)
Therefore a 15-20ms max scheduling deadline 
(on modern PC hardware) should be realistic under Linux.
 regards,
Benno.
