Sure, both are "correct", but there would be a lot less
pain and suffering in the world if "unsigned long long"
would be used for 64-bit. It ought to be at least 40 years
before 128-bit types begin to matter. In the Linux world,
we can consider "long long" to be 64-bit, "int" to be
32-bit, and "long" to be the same size as a pointer.
Then we can ditch the nasty casts:
sprintf(foo, "%llu", (unsigned long long)bar);
This leaves only Win64, Win16, DOS, and ELKS out in
the cold. Like we should care for kernel & glibc!
