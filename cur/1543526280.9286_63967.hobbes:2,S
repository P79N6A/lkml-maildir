Hi. Anyone knows who (if any) is working
on an Adaptec AAA-131/132 multiple disk driver ?
It works with a single disk, but no way to
make it boot with two or more. (it hangs _before_
lilo, but only after linux is installed. With other
OSes is fine, so no hw problems, I think.)
	- 2.2.12/aic7xxx
	- no raid, no mirroring. 
	- Just multiple separate disks
	- IBM Ultrastor 9.1GB drives
	- PIII 500Mhz Asus mb.
