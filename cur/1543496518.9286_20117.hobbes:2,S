	Are you referring to some means of mounting /proc so it appears
	visible to ALL processes no matter where they're chroot'd to? If so,
	I'd love to know how.
Try
	# mount -t proc proc /mnt
and behold: two proc filesystems.
(It is a virtual filesystem - you can have seventeen of them for each
chrooted environment.)
