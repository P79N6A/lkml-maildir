I tested your patch and my problem didn't occur again, so it seems to my
this case at least. However sometimes another bug appears instead which
Roland regards it as strace bug.

BTW, There seems to be many problem on signal code... I take a long at it
and detect more bugs (and of cource make patch if possible).
Thanks,
