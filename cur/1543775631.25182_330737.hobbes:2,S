JFS has never worked on architectures with a page size greater than 4K
until (would you believe?) 2.6.12-rc4.  I bet if you would try a more
recent kernel, you would no longer see this problem.
In case you would continue to see problems with a newer kernel, I'd like
to know.  I'll be on vacation until July 13, so my email access will be
sporadic.
Thanks,
Shaggy
