It's just damn trivial to pack your files into cpio archive and gzip it.
No need for any filesystem code in kernel, be it ext2, minix or other.
initrd => initramfs conversion (what you said I "force" on users) is
to switch from loop+whatever-fs-du-jur to plain dirrectory and cpio,
and to add the final mount+run_init into the initrd script.  And after
that's done, everything becomes good... ;)
