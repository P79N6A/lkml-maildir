The most pragmatic thing to do is to take the comment from the
changeset, which in this case is "mm: get_user_pages vs. try_to_unmap" 
and plop that into google as "changelog mm: get_user_pages vs.
try_to_unmap".. and that will point you very quickly to the right
release changelog that includes it, because the changelogs are generally
driven right from the comments.. in this case
 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/ChangeLog-2.6.7-rc3
While this isn't scientific - it has a very high success rate and is
easy as pi..
