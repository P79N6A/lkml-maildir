Oh, yeah. I used the original one posted here (actually I get from some -mm
patch collection IIRC, I don't remember from which one).
Anyway, my suggestion remains, that the 
+       if (dev->subsystem_vendor != PCI_VENDOR_ID_ASUSTEK)
+               return;
+       if (dev->device != PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237)
+               return;
might be not needed at all as it is not ASUS specific. I don't understand
the second if, as (from my limited knowledge) it seems that 
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,    PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237,
asus_hides_ac97_lpc );
already means the function will be called only for devices with PCI id
PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237 .
