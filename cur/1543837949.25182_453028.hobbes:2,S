Starting TCP timestamp from zero or any other arbitrary value for each 
new connection will not give you any security benefits. There is no 
simple way aleph1 or e-eye will get a remote shell or steal your credit 
card number if there is a buffer overflow in kernel and they will know 
it's release.
So your proposals just are not needed for majority of people, but if you
strongly feel it will help to find a cure for cancer, implement it and
prove it's usefullness to netdev community.
