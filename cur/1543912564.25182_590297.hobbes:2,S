Agree. I've got rig from timekeeping. Now I'm using system device tree shutdown interface, as you suggested. I've added HPET system device class with shutdown method and HPET device to sysdev.

So you suggest to check if HPET is present in HPET init code even if HPET disabled in boot kernel command line or APIC is disabled. And if HPET is present and kernel not going to use it - disable HPET interrupts?

Removed CONFIG_KEXEC.
So here is new version of fix. Patch against 2.6.23-rc3.
Eric, review please. Thanks.
