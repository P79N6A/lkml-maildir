After inadvertently helping to discover the bug in Mozilla, I use the sendpatchset 
script written by Paul Jackson at:
http://www.speakeasy.org/~pj99/sgi/sendpatchset
That lets people's patch-collecting scripts work properly, since (apparently) most 
of the m choke on the MIME headers from attachments.
If you need to connect directly to your ISP, Paul sent me a fix I can forward.
