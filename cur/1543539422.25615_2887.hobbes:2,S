Yes, it's a good comparison. By writing data to the /dev/hda device you
will never generate an invalid IDE command. By mounting it and using it
in any way neither. You need to invoke an ioctl to do it.
If there was a more low-level access to the device, it should be done
there, but /dev/hda is the lowest level accessible from userland.

In this case the /dev/hda way IS the lower level interface.
