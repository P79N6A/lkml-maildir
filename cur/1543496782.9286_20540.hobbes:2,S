This sounds suspiciously like the 'larger-blocks-for-larger-FSes'
tactic other systems have been using to hide the bad scalability
of their algorithms.
A larger page size is no compensation for the lack of a decent
read-{ahead,back,anywhere} I/O clustering algorithm in the OS.
I believe we should take the more appropriate path and build
a proper 'smart' algorithm. Once we're optimizing for I/O
minimization, CPU is relatively cheap anyway...
