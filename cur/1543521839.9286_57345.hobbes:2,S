__SMP__ has been obsolete ever since SMP was made a real config option. 
This patch is just finishing the job.  If a standalone module must
continue to use __SMP__, it could do:
#if defined(CONFIG_SMP) && !defined(__SMP__)
#define __SMP__
#endif
This has been discussed before.  Change during a development kernel is
expected.  Backwards compatability is not guaranteed.  We don't want to
fall into that trap.
