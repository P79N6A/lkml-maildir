Steve, there is a remark about XFS below which you are going to be more
expert on.

The above I agree with.  Your words below though are irresponsible.
I get users who tell me that ext* is crap and fsck.ext2 corrupted their
filesystem and thats why they use ReiserFS.  A difference between us is
that I tell them that with all the major linux filesystems (I include
XFS and JFS in this)  it is by this time far more likely to be hardware
that caused corruption than the filesystem software, whereas I guess you
tell them something else.
Describing us as trashing data at the slightest sign of trouble is
irresponsible.  We do block journaling not logical journaling, but there
is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with logical journaling, and no
reason why it could not be just as robust if that is what XFS uses, so I
suspect the rest of your remarks about XFS are unlikely to be sound.
I would say much more, but I am trying to avoid flames this week.
Ted, please try to consider that maybe your competitors also do a fairly
good job at the mundane but important aspects of filesystem work, and
lets all avoid FUDing each others work.  Both ext* and XFS are excellent
filesystems, and Linux is lucky to have 3 of the 4 best filesystems
available for it.
It will be interesting to see though whether Dominic Giampaolo beats all
three of us in the next five years.  He probably won't have the
performance, but he sure might have the semantic features, and he is
very bright.  If MS ever makes good use of the talent they have been
hiring, we'll have a hard time there also.  We may get lucky on that
though.....;-)
