I havent implemented that yet, so I will look at your next question:

Why is the hierarchy bit important here? Usually controllers need to
know "tell me what cpuset this task belongs to", which is answered
by tsk->nsproxy->ctlr_data[CPUSET_ID].
The only usecase of storing hierarchy I have found is in container_clone()
where you need to create a directory in the right hierarchy, so knowing
the hierarchy to which a controller is bound becomes important.
