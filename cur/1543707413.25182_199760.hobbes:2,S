How about large files (e.g. > 2Gb).
Do you have specs on your above statement? Not that I doubt
reiserfs, but I have been generally unhappy with its performance,
especially when huge files are involved. And I have suffered severe
corruption from a single bad block. A lot of people have suggested
using XFS. I am not a guru, so these statements are far from
educated.
