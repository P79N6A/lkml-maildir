Doing this based on module name has been deprecated basically forever,
because it doesn't work *at all* when you build it into the kernel.
The reason that modules know their own name is that boot parameters
are called by it.
Four possible solutions:
1) Fix dummy to be a real device driver.
2) Add a module parameter to set the device name on dummy.o
3) Allow the build system to construct multiple modules.
4) Implement modprobe --rename.
If none of them appeals, we can discuss it.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
