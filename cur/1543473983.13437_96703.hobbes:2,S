Hi,
I saw your post on the NFS patch (below), but I was looking over the
Sun RPC code in order to better understand how to use the kernel socket
services.  Because what I want to do uses TCP, I was closely examining
the TCP Sun RPC code.  I've either found some problems or I *really*
don't understand how this works (I'm willing to believe either).
I've focused my attention in net/sunrpc/svcsock.c and here's what I'm
having problems with:
1. In the function svc_tcp_recvfrom() there is a call to
svc_recv_available
   which returns the number of bytes currently available on the socket.
   It checks to see if the value returned is < the size of the record,
if
   there are not enough bytes yet to make a complete record it sets len
   to -EAGAIN, however, it falls through to svc_recvfrom() and loses
this
   information because it resets len with the amount read from the
socket.
   If I'm interpreting this right, there is the potential for partial
   packets to cause garbage to appear at the end of the RPC packet.  If
   this is correct, this could be solved by having a "goto error" after
   len is set to -EAGAIN.
2. I think this one is a little more subtle and I'm not sure if RPCs get
   "batched" into a single TCP packet.  If they do here's the problem:
   The code in svc_tcp_recvfrom() reads the first RPC header from the
   socket.  It then reads the amount of data indicated by the record
   length (there may be another issue here -- what if the record length
   is greater than the buffer -- I *think* there won't be data over-runs
   but you've only captured part of the RPC request).  It then clears
   the idea that it has data (by calling svc_sock_received() wich
decrements
   the sk_data field).  So if we assume that there were two RPC requests
   in a single TCP packet, we still have the second RPC request on the
   socket, but no indication that there is any data on the socket. 
There
   is no code that ensures that there is no remaining data on the socket
   when it resets the sk_data flag.
I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know if my analysis is
correct or if I'm mis-understanding something.  Again, I don't have any 
tests that illustrate this, it was just what I found reading over the
code.
BTW I haven't looked at 2.2.0pre-x code but as of 2.1.131 the above was
true.
Thanks.
