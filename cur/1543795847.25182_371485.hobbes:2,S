Yes there is, you're allowing userspace usage of RDPMC and you're
guaranteeing that PMC0 will always be a cycle counter. The RDPMC usage
is benign (assuming you make a note somewhere that future versions of
Linux might disable both RDPMC and RDTSC(P) to prevent timing-channel
attacks), but that "PMC0 is a cycle counter" guarantee will probably
come back to haunt you.

And you are now suggesting people should use RDPMC instead of OS
services?

I don't think that's a reasonable assumption at all.
The definition of all these performance events for the Opteron is hidden
away in a very terse chart in the BIOS/Kernel manual.
That chart contains incompatible variations for pre-B, B, and C revision
processors and (among other strange things) includes instructions for
the monitoring of segment register loads to the HS register.
Everything is telling me that this is not something AMD intends to keep
stable and it isn't even something they're interested in documenting
very well at all.
My problem with this is basically that you are abusing something not
intended as a RDTSC-like interface to replace RDTSC, you're using a
scarce resource that could probably be put to better use to do it,
there's no guarantee that this abuse will continue to work in future
processor revisions, and this is a userspace-visible ABI change that
will have to be maintained indefinitely.
