Well, I certainly prefer not to, simply because you might as well send 
them to linux-kernel and get it resolved that way by some random person 
who just happens to be awake.
It looks like 
 - an ACPI configuration bug, where CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP is allowed even
   though CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND is not enabled.
 - keyboard.c and parts of VT not depending on CONFIG_INPUT
 - device mapper using vcalloc() even though no such function has ever 
   existed in the kernel (it's vmalloc + memset()).
and I think the only way to fix these things is to publicly shame 
maintainers into fixing the stuff they maintain.
