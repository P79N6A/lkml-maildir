I will make a revised patch, remove inline and putting inside usercopy.c

I run faster_intel_copy on my Athlon and works OK and much much faster,
so how about grouping CPU type,
generic i386/i486
  use org REP MOVSL copy
generic i586
  keep as the current 5.45
  use revised REP MOVSL copy 
generic i686
  use revised REP MOVSL copy and unrolled MOVL
if SSE or 3DNOW comes out select them by MPENTIUMIII/4/K7
