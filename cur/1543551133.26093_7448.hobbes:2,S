I am currently booted into a 2.4.0-test10-pre1 kernel with two
modifications, the VIA 3.6 drivers you have provided and the Patch from
Andre that you sent.  My IBM is the primary master with the zip as its
slave and the Kenwood is the secondary master with the Plextor as its
slave.  Here is my /proc/ide/via file:
