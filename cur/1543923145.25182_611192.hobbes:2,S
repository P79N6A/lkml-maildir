It's unfortunately more complicated than that. What basically needs to be done 
is to separate declarations from its users (usually inline functions). The 
problem is to correctly pull the declarations from the <asm/...> and 
<linux/...> header in the correct order. A typical mistake is to put 
declarations and inline functions in the same linux header and then include 
some additional from an asm header. For most high level header it's not much 
of a problem, but let's take <linux/list.h> as example. struct list_head is 
used everywhere, but just to get this one definition one also gets quite a 
few other dependencies as well.
bye, Roman
