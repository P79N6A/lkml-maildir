Yes, this does look a lot nicer, thanks.
Two observations.
1/ I was confused that you added a call to mutex_init.   One would
 normally expect to only have one of these for any given mutex, so
 adding one was a surprise.
 I now realise that the purpose of this call is not exactly to init
 the mutex, but to init the lockdep class in case this inode was
 previously used for a partition but is now being used for a whole
 device.  This makes sense, but renders the mutex_init in 
 init_once pointless.  Maybe that should be removed?
2/ You are introducing a new call to get_gendisk.
   This bothers me for two reasons.  Both relate to a comparison
   with the call to get_gendisk in block_dev.c:do_open.
   a/ That call is protected by lock_kernel.  Your call is not.
   b/ That call is followed by a test for '!disk' implying that it
       can return NULL.  Yours is not - at least not obviously
       (put_disk does have the check).
   I'm not sure if these are actually problems, but the do bother me.
   Thinking through the possibly reasons for the lock_kernel, I wonder
   it the current device number mapping scheme actually allows you
   to determine if something is partitioned or not in a static sense.
   Maybe that is only guaranteed to be stable while the device is
   open...
   I wonder if Al Viro could put my mind at rest .... Al - do you have
   a moment to look at this?  Thanks.
