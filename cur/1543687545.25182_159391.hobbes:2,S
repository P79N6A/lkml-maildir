This possibly can be done by selecting the pin that is not already
programmed by 
setup_IO_APIC_irqs(), and do a manual setup_IO_APIC_irqs() on that, for
HPET
usage.

Thanks for all the comments/suggestions. I will work on using early
ioremap in 
place of fixmap and resend the patch.

I totally agree with you. Just one additional bit would have solved the 
these problems. Also, I do not understand why RTC interrupts were
overridden 
at all, when HPET cannot provide complete RTC functionality and it does
not 
know anything about RTC time.
Thanks,
