If Linus accepts the patch below, then yes :-)
Add pax_global_header to Documentation/dontdiff
Kernel tar-archives created by git contain an extended header with the git 
commit ID that was used to generate the tar-tree. If your tar is older 
than 1.14 then this extended header will be extracted as a regular file 
called pax_global_header. Patches should never be generated against this 
file, so it should be listed in dontdiff.
