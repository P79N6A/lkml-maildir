Hi, are there any quota gurus around?
The problem is as follows:
I'm allocating a couple of raw disk blocks on ext2. Currently,
quotas are ignored. What's the recommended strategy to count
these blocks?
In additon, these blocks are shared among potentially many users.
Is there any agreed-upon way to account for this?
Any ideas what it takes to make quotacheck count these blocks correctly?
(Currently, it's not even easy to find out how many blocks are
allocated for a particular user and inode.)
Thanks,
Andreas
