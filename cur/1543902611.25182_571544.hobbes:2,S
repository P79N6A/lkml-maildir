Hello.
> I didn't hear anything from the misc device maintainer (for the FLASH ROM
> Storage Driver).
Actually, I am not acting as a maintainer. I'm not active enough nor
up to date with all the structure of kernel maintainance. So please
don't wait for me.
Actually, I tried a pair of times to have my name removed from the
MAINTAINERS file over the years without success. Actually, I didn't
care a lot because nobody relly used that entry. I think it's time for
me to learn how to do it in the proper way.
