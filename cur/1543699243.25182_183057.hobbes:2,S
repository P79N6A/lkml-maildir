I see such announcements. I think we should just kill them all:
Installing knfsd (copyright (C) 1996 okir@monad.swb.de).
CSLIP: code copyright 1989 Regents of the University of California.
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
ip_tables: (C) 2000-2002 Netfilter core team
Or perhaps we can replace 'POSIX conformance testing by UNIFIX' with
'Distribute under GPLv2'?
