Subject: [PATCH] NTP: remove clock_was_set() call to prevent deadlock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/3/260

The clock_was_set() call in seconds_overflow() which happens only when
leap seconds are inserted / deleted is wrong in two aspects:
1. it results in a call to on_each_cpu() with interrupts disabled
2. it is potential deadlock source vs. call_lock in smp_call_function()
The only possible side effect of the removal might be, that an absolute
CLOCK_REALTIME timer fires 1 second too late, in the rare case of leap
second deletion and an absolute CLOCK_REALTIME timer which expires in
the affected time frame. It will never fire too early.
This was probably observed by the reporter of a June 30th -> July 1st

A similar problem was observed by Dave Jones, who provided a screen shot
with a lockdep back trace, which allowed to analyse the problem.
