It should be.  We're using a trick similar to this one to build up
equivalence classes of interrupt handlers tracking which functions are
assigned to struct fields, or passed as the same parameter to a
function (request_irq being the prime example).  You'd expect that if 
any function passed/assigned to a given function/field is an 
interrupt handler then the rest are too.
The big win will be when checkers can get at global data structure
initializers.  From an outsiders view, it seems like most device
methods are registered that way.
