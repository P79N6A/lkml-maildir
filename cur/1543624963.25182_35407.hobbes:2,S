Interestingly -pipe doesn't give any measurable performance increases or
even leads to a minor decrease in compile speed in my latest tests on
bigger projects like the linux kernel or GIMP. I suspect that's because
of the caching nature of nowadays systems: the temporary products are
cached in memory and likely not to never end on a drive because they're
read and removed before the point the filesystem decides to physically
write the data.
I also benchmarked tmpfs mounts and it demonstrated - to my surprise -
small advantages slightly above the noise range; I suspect this is due
to the way it handles files in memory.
