Thank you very much for asking back. It is Linux 2.2.12, just as delivered
with RedHat 6.1 distribution.
I issued a tar cf /dev/st0 /usr and a tar tvf /dev/st0 twice, and they both
worked twice, using the version of tar, GNU tar 1.13.11, which was delivered 
with RedHat 6.1.
Sorry for forgetting the version info.
Best regards,
Reinhold Huber
