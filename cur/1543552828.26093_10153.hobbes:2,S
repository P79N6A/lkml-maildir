How could I forget it?  You have defined the heart of the problem,
either object might be built into the kernel, might be a module or
might not even be there, in any case the load order is undefined.  That
is why existing code is kludging things by using get_module_symbol().
inter_module_register, unregister, get, put will solve the inter object
problem but using a clean interface that works with symbol versions.
