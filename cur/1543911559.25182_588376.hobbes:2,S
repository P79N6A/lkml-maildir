I assume they work on p5 and p6 too, no ??

Heh. Do the math. Even on 1gigabit cards, that's not enough:
(1gigabit/sec) x (byte/8 bits) x (packet/1500bytes) x (sec/1000 jiffy) 
is 83 packets a jiffy (for big packets, even more for small packets, 
and more again for 10 gigabit cards). So polling once per jiffy is a 
latency disaster.
