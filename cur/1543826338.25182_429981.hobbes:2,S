The patch doesn't as-is, which means it runs on a lot of hardware
where it shoudln't.
I'm a confused lost as to why this was acked/merged when:
> +DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237, k8t_sound_hostbridge);
clearly it will run for a wide-variety of hardware.  I think the quirk
should probably also check DMI tables or similar to detect the
board/BIOS version that it's intended for.  Certainly that would make
this safer.
I don't have access to this hardware so how about something like this
for now?

Be more selective when running the MSI-K8T-Neo2Fir soundcard PCI quirk
so as not to run this on hardware where it's probably not needed.
