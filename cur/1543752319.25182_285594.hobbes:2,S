No, the kernel has the "you break it, you fix it" rule.  And as you want
to use platform_data for something other than the drivers that are
currently using it for, you need to fix everyone else up before I can
accept such a change.
And yes, one could argue that those drivers are "doing the wrong thing",
but hey, they did it first, as no one else was using this field, and it
solved a need for them.  So you could successfully argue that they are
the correct ones here :)
thanks,
