If your are at it: I was always itching my had what
pci_alloc_inconsistent and pci_free_inconsistent is supposed to be?
Negating semantically the consistent attribute shows nicely
that the _consistent is a bad nomenclatures. Perhaps something
more related to the purpose of it would help. Like
ioalloc() and iofree()
Could be even abstracted from the bus implementation.
And of course much less typing...
