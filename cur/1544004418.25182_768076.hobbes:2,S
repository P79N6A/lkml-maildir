It's not about angering, it's about causing regressions in
functionality.  Doing this will completely break the ability to run
generic distros on the OLPC hardware without a special kernel.  Which
has been something that a lot of work has gone on upstream to avoid for
all sorts of cases (VMI, Xen, SMP, ...).

This probably needs to be done as a precondition for getting the alsa
changes merged or the alsa changes need to have the bits which depend on
geode_gpio ripped out until it can be done.  Or those parts
conditionalized.  Drivers should not depend on what cpu type you're
building for...
