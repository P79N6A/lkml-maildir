Hi !
I've a matrox mystique with 8Mb RAM.
I've a problem when I use matroxfb instead vesafb.
If I enable CONFIG_FB_VESA, I get the nice logo and all is right for me.
If I enable CONFIG_FB_MATROX, the beginning of each line is in the middle
of the screen and the cursor position does not match the prompt position.
Nevetheless, the screen is 'readable' (no garbage). I've read the files
in ../Documentation/fb and the Framebuffer-HOWTO.
This appends with both 2.2.xx and 2.4.x kernels.
Do I missed something ?
