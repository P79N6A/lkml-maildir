Ok, I'm a JVM guy and I worked on heap-stack-gap issue many moons ago.
The reason that heap-stack-gap on SuSE Linux used to crash Java is
because we are explicitly setting up a guard page to prevent heap-stack
collision (a stack guard is also required in order to throw stack
overflow exception). So in a java program, prev_vma in your patch does
not point to regular heap memory but the guard page. The hidden gap
would cause SIGSEGV to occur before the thread actually hits the guard,
that confused JVM. We had to work around it by reading the gap size from
/proc.
I'd recommend adding an extra check to see if prev_vma is read/write,
and ignoring heap-stack-gap if prev_vma is guard page. Having a hidden
gap does not offer any extra protection, it only confuses an application
if it manages stack guard.
