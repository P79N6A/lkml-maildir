Eh, no kernel version is associated with System.map.  It has no embedded
information, what-so-ever, aside from the symbols.
Do what everyone else does and name your System.map appropriately, i.e.
System.map-2.5.8-pre2 and then on boot symlink System.map to
System.map-`uname -r`.  Most (all?) distributions do this for you
already.
You can also pass readprofile the -m flag to specify the map file to
use.  A little script that does "readprofile -m System.map-`uname -r`"
would work fine.
