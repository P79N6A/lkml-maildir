Hi!
 Here is more updated work on the vgacon to fbcon to vgacon again code. I
almost got it. I just need to figure out how to free up the resources from
the fbdev drivers I tried it out on. I have attemped on the G400 matrox
driver and the vga16 driver. Both give a xxxx: Device or resource busy
when I go to rrmod it.
