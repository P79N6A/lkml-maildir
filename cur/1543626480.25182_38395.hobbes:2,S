md tries to monitor the activity on the component devices and limits
rebuild activity when there appears to be other activity.
It measures "other activity" as "blocks added to kstat.dk_drive_?blk",
minus "block due to resync activity".
When a component device is an md array, nothing gets recorded
in kstat, but lots is recorded as resync activity, so this "other 
activity" appears as a negative number which, due to storage in an
unsigned long, appears rather large.
