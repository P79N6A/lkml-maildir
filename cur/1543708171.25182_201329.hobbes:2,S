In an interesting twist of fate, that is exactly what I am currently 
working on planning, see the patches that I pushed through last week, 
according to my estimates, I am about 1/3 of the way through 
modernising the 2.6 driver. However, as of yet I have received no 
comment from LSI about the modifications to the drivers that I have 
made. I have received a response from Jeff Garzik that it appears that 
I am on the right track.
As a side issue, the comment in the 2.6 driver that says that it is 
2.00.3 is just plain wrong. Look at the driver  from 2.6 and the 2.00.3 
release, there are a lot of differences there! The problem is that the 
2.6 and 2.4 drivers diverged a little at some point in the past, and 
then quite a lot in 2.6.1, hence the reason for taking so long to 
forward port the changes.
Cheers,
Paul
