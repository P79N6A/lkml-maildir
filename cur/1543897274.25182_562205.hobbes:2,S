There are other ways to read the clock and would require similiar 
synchronization hooks.
Some archs can implement sys_time() in userspace, so there this change 
would be useless.
I don't know what clock was used in the test, so maybe it can be replaced 
with a faster clock.
AFAICT OLTP is not really a common application for most users, so there 
may be other ways to optimize this special case. Just reading the patch 
isn't enough here, you have to look at the whole picture and some pieces 
are still missing...
bye, Roman
