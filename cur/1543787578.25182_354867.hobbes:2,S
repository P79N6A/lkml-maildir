Indeed.  What _has_ changed recently is that IIRC do_truncate used to
set ATTR_SIZE | ATTR_CTIME | ATTR_MTIME at which point the two were
consistent.  But (relatively) recently someone removed the ATTR_MTIME
from do_truncate and forgot to remove it from inode_setattr...

I have finished coding the initial cut of ntfs_truncate() (regular files
only, i.e. uncompressed, unencrypted, and
not-attribute-list-attribute-containing).  (-:
Now I am at the testing it stage and I was doing:
$ stat ntfs/file
$ truncate ntfs/file <someval>
$ stat ntfs/file
And noticed that the ctime was chaning but not the mtime so I read the
man page which suggested mtime ought to change so I had a quick look at
relevant kernel code and the inconsistency stared me in the face.  (-;

Ah, I thought the VFS took care of _all_ {a,c,m} time changes and we
filesystem developers only ever had to write the changed times to
disk...
Obviously I was wrong...
I will have a look at ext2/3.

Indeed, it would be useful for unsuspecting fs developers like me.  (-;

Right.  I seem to remember this being different some time ago.  IIRC the
kernel did update {a,m,c}time in many places...

I certainly don't.  It just should be consistent.  (-:
