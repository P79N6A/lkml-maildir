That's the error I'm getting when I try and compile this.  Here's how it 
happened:
I, (mayhap rather foolishly) decided that I would try and compile 
Interpersonal Computing's (www.ipc.de) driver for the Philips ScreenMachine 
II.  So I agreed to their NDA and downloaded the source.  I then bravely 
untarred the source, went into the subdirectory, and boldly typed 'make'.  It 
gave me this:
cc -O6 -D__KERNEL__ -DLINUX -DMODULE -Wall         -c vmchrd.c -o vmchrd.o
In file included from /usr/include/asm/system.h:4,
                 from /usr/include/asm/semaphore.h:27,
                 from /usr/include/linux/fs.h:165,
                 from /usr/include/linux/capability.h:13,
                 from /usr/include/linux/binfmts.h:5,
                 from /usr/include/linux/sched.h:8,
                 from /usr/include/linux/vmalloc.h:4,
                 from /usr/include/asm/io.h:101,
                 from vmchrd.c:24:
/usr/include/linux/kernel.h:45: `printk' is an unrecognized format function 
type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^
Looking at kernel.h, lines 44-45 we have:
NORET_TYPE void panic(const char * fmt, ...)
        __attribute__ ((NORET_AND format (printf, 1, 2)));
This would seem to be the culprit, but further than that, I have no idea what 
it means.  Line 44 looks like a pretty standard function definition, but line 
45 makes no sense to me.
So, any explanations or suggestions would be most helpful.  I unfortunately 
can't give out the actual source (though I'm trying to convince them to open 
source it), but I'll answer any questions I can.
Thanks in advance.
