At least it handled the Y2K rollover correctly ;-).
Before my auto accident in March, I was sysadminning an engineering lab at
my university.  My main server (Gateway 2000 G6-200, PPro 200/256, running
rh5.0/2.0.36) had this problem.  The clock would warp forward (and
occasionally backward), with no explanation.  Unfortunately, I can't debug
this anymore, as in my absence someone decided that the machine asking for
a full e2fsck meant the drive was dead, and fdisk'ed/NT'ed the box.
But I feel your pain.  My box Y2K'ed on Nov 29 1998 (and Jan 26 1999 and
Feb 13 1999).
