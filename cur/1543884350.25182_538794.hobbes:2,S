Sure, will do. Since I've gotten almost no feedback about these patches 
whatsoever, I figured either I was doing it wrong or nobody cared. I guess 
I'll finish them all up and resubmit them and hope they stick. Gimme a 
few days: There's a huge number of files throughout the tree to change, 
and some of them (like the .map files) require non-trivial alterations.
(Were you able to successfully apply the patch attached in octet-stream 
encoding?)
