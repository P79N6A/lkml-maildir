How well does this driver work if you don't have a firmware
driver initialize the card? aka a pci option ROM.
I am interested because with LinuxBIOS it is still a pain to run
PCI option roms, and I don't necessarily even have then if it a
motherboard with video.  There are some embedded/non-x86 platforms
with similar issues.  
My primary interest is in the cheap ATI Rage XL chip that is on many
server board. PCI Vendor/device  id 1002:4752 (rev 27) from lspci.
If nothing else if some one could point me to some resources on
how to get the appropriate documentation from the video chipset
manufacturers I would be happy.
But I did want to at least point that running a system with out bios
initialized video was certainly among the cases that are used.
