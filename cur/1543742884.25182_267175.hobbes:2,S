this is how it works:
static unsigned int rtc_poll(struct file *file, poll_table *wait)
{
        unsigned long l;
        if (rtc_has_irq == 0)
                return 0;
        poll_wait(file, &rtc_wait, wait);
        spin_lock_irq (&rtc_lock);
        l = rtc_irq_data;
        spin_unlock_irq (&rtc_lock);
        if (l != 0)
                return POLLIN | POLLRDNORM;
        return 0;
}
it seems that it cannot return with incomplete data. rtc_has_irq is a
boot-time-only thing - either the RTC can generate interrupts or it
cannot. rtc_irq_data is updated atomically - either it's full with 4
bytes or it's completely empty.
safest would be to call the read() with O_NONBLOCK and figure out how
often -EAGAIN happens? (O_NONBLOCK is honored by /dev/rtc.)
but i could imagine that you could get into a 'wrong phase' if for
whatever reason an RTC interrupt slips in before the poll()?
