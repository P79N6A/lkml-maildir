But unless you have changed something, you can not compile and build the
whole RedHat distribution _on_ the distribution itself (i.e. self hosting)
without a number of changes needed to some packages [1].
We (WireX) found this out in building the Immunix distribution [2].

2. RedHat 6.2 recompiled with the StackGuard compiler. See
