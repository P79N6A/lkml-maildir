i have released the 2.6.16-rc6-rt4 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this too is a fixes-only release. Changes since -rt3:
 - PI boosting fixes (Thomas Gleixner, found by Esben Nielsen)
 - task-exit latency breaker for !PREEMPT_RT preemption modes
   (Hugh Dickins, reported by Lee Revell)
 - SLAB fixes (based on Karsten Wiese's patch)
the SLAB fix might solve the USB problems reported by many.
to build a 2.6.16-rc6-rt4 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.15.tar.bz2
