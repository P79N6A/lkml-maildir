And I'm afraid I won't be able to get errata for the VLSI VAS96011/12 :-( Of
course I can always give it a try...

I'll give that a try...

Hmmm... I'm still wondering why I see the problem when writing to tape or
CD-R(W), while I can't provoke it when writing to disk (Quantum Viking II U2W).
What's so special about tape and CD-R?
