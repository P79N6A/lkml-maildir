This one fixes lockup, but I'm not actually sure that it is better
than before, as both channels are downgraded to the PIO:
... CRC error stuff ...
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset
PDC202XX: Primary channel reset
ide3: reset: master: error (0x00?)
... USB stuff & so on, before mounting root ...
... repeat 4 times:
hde: dma_timer_expiry: dma status = 0x21
hde: timeout waiting for DMA
PDC202XX: Primary channel reset
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset
hde: timeout waiting for DMA
... end of repeat
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 292k freed
init-2.04#
It looks like that hde resurrecting did not cause any damage to the
filesystems (and obviously hde is completely innocent udma100 citizen;
hdg is the only one which should be turned to udma2 or pio).
And strange thing, once I was lucky enough to read partition table from 
hdg, so I could run atapci, and it reports that hde host interface is setup 
for UDMA4, while hdg for UDMA2. So host hardware is actually probably set 
ok, it is just "hdg: 234441648 sectors (120034 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, 
CHS=232581/16/63, UDMA(100)" which contains wrong value, and hdg itself, 
which says that udma5 is selected (and does not work).
