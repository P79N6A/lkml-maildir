If we go for a central '.gitignore' then we will most probarly see a
file that is only added entries to, not removed. We saw that in the bk
days.
Today there are 23 .gitignores in the kernel - including the ones
from this patchset.
In may other cases we avoid this central point of information disaster
and we shall avoid it for .gitignore too.
