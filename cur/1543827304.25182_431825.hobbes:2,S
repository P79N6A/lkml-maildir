Thanks for at least looking at the code, which was the intention of posting
the patches...  It caused quite a few more ruffled feathers than we expected.

As Christoph quoted Alex, "the extents code", which you confirm is 3 "ifs".

Actually, 64-bit support in the JBD code was written by Zach Brown
for OCFS, so I think they want this patch into the kernel regardless.
It's relatively simple change though - all conditional on a single flag.

Though there are really only 2 conditionals (in macros, one for read and
one for write) that are used everywhere, so it's not as bad as it seems.

These are all related to 48-bit filesystem support, not strictly
extents.  Much of the 48-bit code is dependent upon CONFIG_LBD or
sizeof(ext3_fsblk_t), so if people have no desire to use large (2TB+) or
larger (16TB+) filesystems these conditionals disappear at compile time.
Cheers, Andreas
