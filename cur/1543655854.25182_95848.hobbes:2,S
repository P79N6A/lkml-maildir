I got the 2.4.17 sources and applied the patch. yenta.c and main.c could not 
be patched automatically, so I tried to apply it by hand line by line.
Unfortunately when I boot a kernel compiled witch this modified sources I get 
an "Unable to handle kernel pagin request at virtual address 0000413d"
Maybe this patch is to be used on some Pre Version of 2.4.17 ?!?!
