Can you express "is going to be modified" in the unit "days"?
I've seen too many times that someone said "I will need this export 
soon", and some months or even a year later the code using it was still 
part of the kernel.
Unexporting something today does still allow re-exporting it when it's 
actually required - simply add the trivial patch undoing my unexport 
when you submit your driver for inclusion in the kernel.
