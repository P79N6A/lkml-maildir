It really depends on the specific structure of the text file. For Python
scripts, the Python interpreter will reject a U+FEFF in the middle of
the file as a syntax error (*). This is, IMO, a reasonable reaction: you
just shouldn't concatenate Python scripts blindly. They may have
different source encodings, so any concatenation of Python scripts
needs to convert them both into a common encoding. The first script
may also fail to terminate with a newline, so concatenating Python
scripts also needs to insert a line break. In edition, you would
also typically want to remove the docstring in the second file.
The same holds for many other formats: for example, you cannot blindly
concatenate XML files, either (the result often won't be an XML file).
So that the BOM is treated as an error would give no problem.

The point is that the BOM *also* is a regular character, U+FEFF. It used
to have a specific function, too, but now U+2060 (WORD JOINER) should
be used for that function. So U+FEFF is exclusively used for the BOM
now. If you see it in the middle of a file, you know it doesn't belong
there (*). In processing the file, you can complain, you can ignore it,
and you can chose to strip it off. Which of these you do depends on
the application; if you don't know better, treating it as ZERO WIDTH
NON-BREAKING SPACE is the recommended reaction.

(*) unless it occurs in a string literal, in which case it becomes
part of the string. In the case of concatenating two Python files,
it won't be part of a string literal, though, but instead occur
at the beginning of a line.
