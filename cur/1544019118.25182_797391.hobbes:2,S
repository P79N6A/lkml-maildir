  Hi,
  I've used checkpatch.pl to verify one of my patches. It complains:
ERROR: trailing statements should be on next line
#167: FILE: fs/quota/quota_tree.c:249:
+       for (i = 0, ddquot = buf + sizeof(struct qt_disk_dqdbheader);
[...]
             i++, ddquot += info->dqi_entry_size);
  But the code looks like:
        for (i = 0, ddquot = buf + sizeof(struct qt_disk_dqdbheader);
             i < qtree_dqstr_in_blk(info) && !qtree_entry_unused(info, ddquot);
             i++, ddquot += info->dqi_entry_size);
  Which is IMHO correct. Maybe it's because the for has actually empty body
and the ; is at the end of the line with for. But I didn't find anything in
CodingStyle that would forbid
	for (...);
and
	for (...)
		;
Looks a bit strange.
