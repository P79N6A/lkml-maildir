Hi Ingo,
I'd like to be applied new patch for latencytop fix.
I think it better than old ptaches.
Can you apply this patch for latencytop issues?
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/14/451
It's replacement of old patches you applied.
It makes latency file behavior same as other proc files.
get_proc_task() and put_task_struct() are called at read time,
and returns -ESRCH if get_proc_task() failed.
If is there any problem, please let me know.
thanks,
Hiroshi Shimamoto
