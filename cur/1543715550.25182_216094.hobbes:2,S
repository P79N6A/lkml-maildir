Umm, I would really appreciate it if you didn't silently leave out bits of
my patches and then just say "I merged your patches".  It took me a little
bit to figure out that the reason panning now isn't used for fbconsole
scrolls is because you just didn't bother to put that part of my patch in.
Is there some reason you left out the following piece of my modedb patch?
+       /* Turn on panning for console scroll by default */
+       info->var.yres_virtual = 30000;
+       info->var.accel_flags |= FB_ACCELF_TEXT;
+       if (neofb_check_var(&info->var, info))
+               goto err_map_video;
