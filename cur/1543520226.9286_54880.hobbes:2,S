Superb - someone else who thinks this sort of bloat will be linux's
downfall.
Come on people - knfsd was (reasonably) sensible, but khttpd is daft.
Most people don't want to be compiling kernel modules to do web-serving.
Apache / others are fine for the job - let's stop trying to make the kernel
a
jack-of-all-trades, and make it a "damned-good-at-what-it-needs-to-do"
instead.
Just my $0.02
