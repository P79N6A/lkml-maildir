Well, there are two issues.  That's a kind of "dirty shutdown" case, for
which there's a clear need to update the EHCI driver.  I'm working on
a fix for it, presumably someone can help test the patch.

... and that's the "clean shutdown" case, where it seems like the
CardBus code in the 2.4 kernels is clearly doing the wrong thing:
an operation sequence turns those into a dirty shutdown.  (Which
then trip over the EHCI "dirty shutdown" problem.)
It'd be nice if someone were to work on fixing that CardBus problem
too, since it's likely it'll break other drivers.  The fact that
nobody has stepped in there is why the discussion went the direction
it did ... :)
