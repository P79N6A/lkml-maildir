It doesn't improve anything in terms of performance or anything.  It just
makes use of the kref api for refcounting.  My next patchset will be to
extend the kref api to do lockfree refcounting, and eliminate
use of files_struct.file_lock on the reader side (lock free fd lookup) .  
That improves performance for fd lookups -- for threaded workloads which 
do lot of io.  This was the step by step approach I am following to do 
lockfree refcounting as was agreed earlier.
I can do a patch to just extend kref api for lockfree refcounting and
use them for for the lock free fd lookup patch directly if you like to see
it that way.
Thanks,
Kiran
