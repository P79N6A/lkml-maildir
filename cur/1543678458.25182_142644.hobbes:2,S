Not to upset or insult somebody, but there are thousands of users which
seem to be completely unable to read. Some are even resistent towards
learning. Using something, esp complex systems like database servers SCM
tools et al. actually requires to basically understand them (if you want
to do your job right).
...and then, there are those who do installations of complex software.
Either some admin who's already there can do the setup (and will need a
week to get it right), or you can do that for him, charging some $$$.
_But_ the company has got a reliably working installation within hours.
