Providing you use the "sync" export option, the Linux kNFSd should
meet this requirement.

To help with the audit: the wcc data is set by "fh_unlock".  i.e. when
a filehandle is unlocked (up(i_sem)) a copy of the state information
is taken and included where appropriate in the reply.
The only place that I am aware of where we *do*not* return wcc data is
for the WRITE request (which you have not listed).  As the underlying
filesystem is left to do whatever locking it thinks is appropriate,
and vfs_write does none, nfsd is not in a position to lock it itself
against sys_write and so cannot record before and after stat
information that is atomic w.r.t the update.
