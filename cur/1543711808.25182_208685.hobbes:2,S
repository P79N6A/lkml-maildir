Or better: since both of OSS and ALSA are sound systems, let OSS maintainers
start hacking ALSA, so missing parts in ALSA which presents in OSS can be
implemented. Having one sound system would be better, especially in the
official kernel tree. It's another story, if you have multiple one outside
the "official" kernel source. imho.
