Earliest is wrong I suppose. What I meant is post permissive. Otherwise it
does not make any sense. And what about if there is a version of GPL that
does not require passing a copy of the license along with the program?
I guess it does not matter because somewhere it would still state
"this program is released under GPL" (as you said there is no version
number) so receient can look up what versions of GPL were ever released.
This is different from attaching a specific license.

Why don't you claim that actually the program is in public domain and
the license file just got there by mistake? Attaching a specific license
(and GPL v2 is a distinctive license, not a bumped up version of other
license) places work under this (and only this) license. In my book
this is different form just saying "the program is under GPL".
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
