Hi all,
I noticed that among fellow linux users there is much confusion about the
2.4.x swap requirement. Some heard that it is a _requirement_ to have >=
2*memsize swap or none at all, and others heard that it is advisory in the
sense that performance/stability wil drop drastically when one does not
take this advice to heart.
There was a heated debate about the wisdom of the supposed requirement,
especially since many found it to be a major drawback compared to the
2.2.x series. However, I think there is a need for clarity on the real
status of the issue. Which brings me to my question: Can anyone shed some
light on how 'required' this requirement really is and what one could
expect to happen when this requirement is not met?
Regards,
Johan de Jong.
