	Andrew, thank you very much for your prompt response.
	I'll try tomorrow, as it seemed to had hung and I need to go to the 
university to reboot it.
	Have you kicked it out of your next release? I see that is into 
2.6.2-rc1-mm3.
	Anyway I'll take a look and will report to you.
	Thanks again,
		Ender.
