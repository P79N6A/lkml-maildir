Hi.
This post covers two similar problems, namely the kernel build failure
given certain configuration combinations. The combinations in question
is either CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=y and CONFIG_IRDA_COMPRESSION=y or 
CONFIG_IBMTR=y, CONFIG_PCMCIA_IBMTR=y and CONFIG_PCMCIA_RAYCS=y.
(The relevant sections of the respective .configs are attached below).
The build failures are caused by duplicate inclusion of code in the
final kernel linking. Which is unsurprising since inspection of the
first case reveals that drivers/net/ppp_deflate.c and 
net/irda/compressors/irda_deflate.c both include drivers/net/zlib.c 
and, in the second case, that the IBM tokenring pcmcia driver is
linked together with the driver for the non-pcmcia driver (as per
drivers/net/pcmcia/Makefile).
In both cases we only want the shared code to be included once which
should be doable by some configuration magic, but that is beyond me.
I'll just rat on the problem :)
.config for PPP and IRDA conflict:
CONFIG_PPP=y
# CONFIG_PPP_MULTILINK is not set
# CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC is not set
# CONFIG_PPP_SYNC_TTY is not set
CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=y
# CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP is not set
# CONFIG_PPPOE is not set
[...]
#
# IrDA (infrared) support
#
CONFIG_IRDA=y
#
# IrDA protocols
#
# CONFIG_IRLAN is not set
# CONFIG_IRCOMM is not set
# CONFIG_IRDA_ULTRA is not set
# CONFIG_IRDA_OPTIONS is not set
CONFIG_IRDA_COMPRESSION=y
#
#     IrDA compressors
#
CONFIG_IRDA_DEFLATE=y
.config for pcmcia and non-pcmcia ibm tokenring driver conflict:
(Note that for some reason I could not fathom the viator/Raytheon 
PCMCIA driver had to be included in the configuration for this
failure to appear.)
#
# Token Ring devices

CONFIG_TR=y
CONFIG_IBMTR=y
