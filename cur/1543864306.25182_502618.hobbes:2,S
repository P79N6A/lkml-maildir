How many patches is not to fix bugs, it is worse then some strayed 
whitespace but it is due to reality.
The best is, of course, if neither happened but the next best thing is

I like to discuss but I am not sure what the result would be. Force 
people to use the editors of our choice?

But if you have any ideas, I'm listening.
