Apparently I got in in the middle of this thread and can't find any
previous messages, but this has been a question of mine.  Why not use
squid in httpd accellerated (reverse proxy) mode?  Isn't that what it is
designed for?  I have never used it that way, but am very curious what
others might have to say.  Squid is gpl (right?) so we would still be
using only gpl'd software in the benchmark.
