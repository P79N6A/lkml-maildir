A little generic for my tastes.  I was thinking more like the below
(equally untested).  Note that strictly we should call the module
notifier for NULL at the end of the boot sequence, too.
===
static int want_empress, want_dvb;
/* These need our symbols: we must be fully loaded for them to load */
static int pending_call(struct notifier_block *self, unsigned long state,
			void *module)
{
	if (module != THIS_MODULE || state != MODULE_STATE_LIVE)
		return NOTIFY_DONE;
	if (want_empress)
		request_module("saa7134-empress");
	if (want_dvb)
		request_module("saa7134-dvb);
	return NOTIFY_DONE;
}
static struct notifier_block pending_notifier = {
	.notifier_call = pending_call,
};
int init(void)
{
,,,
	register_module_notifier(&pending_notifier);
}
void cleanup(void)
{
...
	unregister_module_notifier(&pending_notifier);
}
