While you actually  don't get broadcast ARP request very  often (more than a
few per minute is rare), even on a busy net, making it faster doesn't hurt.
I'll write a new patch, thanks.

I know  about this. It  only helps you  not to steal  someone else's  IP, it
doesn't help when someone else just stole your IP.
Take a Solaris box, an IRIX one, or  windows (these are the only ones I have
access to for testing) and they'll all  complain and notice if I steal their
IP.
I find it  useful that a server  syslogs the fact that its  IP was stolen. I
can use that info  to bring up a temporary DHCP IP, and  send a message to a
central  network  monitor which  will  trace  the  culprit MAC  address  and
optionally turn off the switched port it came from.
