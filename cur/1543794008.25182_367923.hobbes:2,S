Subject: [PATCH linux-2.6-block:post-2.6.15 00/10] blk: reimplementation of I/O barrier
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello, Jens, James, Jeff and Bartlomiej.
This is the fifth posting of blk ordered reimplementation.  The
last posting was on 19th, Oct.
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112972609907761&w=2
The generic dispatch queue patchset which is required for this ordered
patchset has made it into the main tree.
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112972555921965&w=2
Changes from the previous post are...
* As core blk files have moved from drivers/block/ to block/, patches
  are updated accordingly.
* In 04_blk_scsi-update-ordered, sd_prepare_flush() is updated to
  initialize rq->cmd_len properly.  This used to work like this
  previously but something broke it.  Note that the original flush
  code is broken too.  James, can you please verify this?
* libata has gone through some changes since last posting.  libata
  updates are rewritten.  Jeff, please review #07 and #08.
Other than above three, nothing has changed.  Jens, after reviewing,
can we push these into -mm?
Thanks.  :-)

01_blk_add-uptodate-to-end_that_request_last.patch
	: add @uptodate to end_that_request_last() and @error to rq_end_io_fn()
	Add @uptodate argument to end_that_request_last() and @error
        to rq_end_io_fn().  There's no generic way to pass error code
        to request completion function, making generic error handling
        of non-fs request difficult (rq->errors is driver-specific and
        each driver uses it differently).  This patch adds @uptodate
        to end_that_request_last() and @error to rq_end_io_fn().
        For fs requests, this doesn't really matter, so just using the
        same uptodate argument used in the last call to
        end_that_request_first() should suffice.  IMHO, this can also
        help the generic command-carrying request Jens is working on.
02_blk_implement-init_request_from_bio.patch
	: separate out bio init part from __make_request
	Separate out bio initialization part from __make_request.  It
        will be used by the following blk_ordered_reimpl.
03_blk_reimplement-ordered.patch
	: reimplement handling of barrier request
	 Reimplement handling of barrier requests.
        * Flexible handling to deal with various capabilities of
          target devices.
	* Retry support for falling back.
	* Tagged queues which don't support ordered tag can do ordered.
04_blk_scsi-update-ordered.patch
	: update SCSI to use new blk_ordered
	All ordered request related stuff delegated to HLD.  Midlayer
        now doens't deal with ordered setting or prepare_flush
        callback.  sd.c updated to deal with blk_queue_ordered
        setting.  Currently, ordered tag isn't used as SCSI midlayer
        cannot guarantee request ordering.
05_blk_scsi-add-fua-support.patch
	: add FUA support to SCSI disk
	Add FUA support to SCSI disk.
06_blk_libata-update-ordered.patch
	: update libata to use new blk_ordered
	Reflect changes in SCSI midlayer and updated to use new
        ordered request implementation
07_blk_libata-add-fua-support.patch
	: add FUA support to libata
	Add FUA support to libata.
08_blk_ide-update-ordered.patch
	: update IDE to use new blk_ordered
	Update IDE to use new blk_ordered.
09_blk_ide-add-fua-support.patch
	: add FUA support to IDE
	Add FUA support to IDE
10_blk_add-barrier-doc.patch
	: I/O barrier documentation
	I/O barrier documentation
