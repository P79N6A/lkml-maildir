Look at your monitor. Technically this is an output device.
But there are little controls, where you can make adjustments.
ioctl is nothing else: A controller for an io-stream.
It also makes quite clear, that we are packetizing read/writes now.
And it cannot be fdopen()ed ;-)
Maybe we COULD split strictly for reads and writes, but
we still need a side channel for that to be opened by
passing a file descriptor.
How else would you control a tty/pty which you got as stdin/stdout?
Maybe one could hack this into xattr-support? ;-)
