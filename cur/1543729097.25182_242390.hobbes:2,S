Here's a minimal jack client which does _not_ produce an xrun on startup
for me (it doesn't really do anything either).. Maybe the xruns are the
other clients fault and not really determined by the jack mechanisms.. I
will extend it step by step to do something functional.. maybe i'll find
out what change introduces xruns. compile with
g++ jack_test.cc `pkg-config jack --libs` -o jack_test
jack_test.cc:
----------------------
#include <jack/jack.h>
#include <iostream>
jack_client_t *client;
jack_port_t *port;
int process(jack_nframes_t frames, void *arg) {
        return 0;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        std::cout << "client_new" << std::endl;
        client = jack_client_new("foo");
        std::cout << "port_register." << std::endl;
        port = jack_port_register(client, "foobar",
JACK_DEFAULT_AUDIO_TYPE, JackPortIsOutput|JackPortIsTerminal, 0);
        std::cout << "set_process_callback" << std::endl;
        jack_set_process_callback(client, process, 0);
        std::cout << "activate" << std::endl;
        jack_activate(client);
        std::cout << "running" << std::endl;
        while(1) {sleep(1);};
}
