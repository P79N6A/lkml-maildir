From the POV that you can use sparsemem on a PC, yes. But from the POV
that setup_memory() in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c not includes a call to
memory_present(), I think it is a fix. =)
While at it, why do we have two copies of setup_memory()? Couldn't
NUMA and non-NUMA share the same code? OTOH, NUMA and discontigmem
seems very integrated/mixed up and there seems to be much activity in
this field so maybe it is nice to keep the NUMA part separated anyway.

Well, I do not have any hardware here that requires sparsemem either,
but I wanted to add NUMA emulation code to be able to run some
multiple-memory-nodes tests on a virtual PC in QEMU. And this little
patch shows my first step which involved getting sparsememto run on a
PC.

Well, my NUMA emulation project has been postponed a bit now, but
sooner or later I or someone else will need sparsemem on non-NUMA. So
getting your testing patches in to -mm seems like a good idea!
Thanks!
