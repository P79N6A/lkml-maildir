I'm not entirely sure, but I guess that most of the time, you assign a
serial port with the help of `inputattach' to a given device driver,
which expects to find its hardware on that port.
OTOH, why do you want to do the serial stuff in kernel land? Isn't it
a *lot* easier to do it in userspace? What's your specific device you
want to work on?
