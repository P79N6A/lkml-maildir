Lets take I2O block the if rule would
if [ $CONFIG_X86 = "y" -a $CONFIG_X86_64 != "y" ] 
	dep_bool ...
fi
if [ $CONFIG_ALPHA = "y" &&  other conditions ...]
	dep_bool ...
fi
and so on
The actual rule being if 32bit little endian || 64bit little endian with
kernel memory objects always below 4Gb and having PCI bus
Thats just one non too complicated driver. CML1 can't handle this
scalably, maybe CML2 could have. 
Secondly you actually want people to discover stuff doesn't work so you
can persuade them to go and fix it. Stick up a 'Good/Probably
Ok/Bad/Hopeless' driver listing on x86_64.org, then once Hammer becomes
in general use post it to the janitor list now and then
