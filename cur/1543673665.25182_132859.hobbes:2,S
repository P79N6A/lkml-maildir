Certainly.  Option 3 certainly doesn't have to be implemented in the first
version :)
In fact, the first version could ignore the core dump issue and setrlimit
will be used to avoid core dumps of sensitive processes.  In the future,
it can be handled more gracefully.

Makes sense.  Only when 3 is implemented, a special /proc interface is
required.  For everything else, setrlimit will suffice.
