Your post was mainly interesting but this section does not look like  
relevant considerations to me. You seem to miss that:
- Playing with memory trashes hardware caches.
- Playing with virtual mapping trashes TLB entries.
- High-end disks have large caches.
- High-end disk firmwares are able to take decisions in order to 
  overlap seek-time + rotationnal latency.
- If you want memory for caching, they you donnot want to have 
  unused stuff in you caches.
- The main memory is shared by CPUs and DMA-able IO devices.
- Resources are limited, even if the current price of memory allows 
  to have much of this one. Just wait for next releases of software 
  and this comfort will disappear, IMO.
The reality an OS has to face is far more complex that the above 4 numbers
you seem to have gotten from your hat, in my opinion.  What we want is to
use _efficiently_ the resources and paging helps to achieve it. We just
want to page intelligently and here is the problem, as you know.

   Gérard.
