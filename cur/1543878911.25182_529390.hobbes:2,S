that works fine if you're defining a single spinlock, but what do you
do in cases like this:
arch/sparc/lib/atomic32.c:      [0 ... (ATOMIC_HASH_SIZE-1)] = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
that is, when you're assigning an array of them?  you still need some
kind of generic, unnamed spinlock in those circumstances, no?
