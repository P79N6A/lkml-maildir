Ah hah!  I found the other SCSI suspend patch:
	
http://lwn.net/Articles/97453/
Anybody (Joshua?) up for reconciling and testing the two?
The main change from Jens/Joshua's patch is that we use SCSI's 
sd_shutdown() to call sync cache, eliminating the need for 
ata_flush_cache(), since the SCSI layer would now perform that.
For bonus points,
1) sd should call START STOP UNIT on suspend, which eliminates the need 
for ata_standby_drive(), and completely encompasses the suspend process 
in the SCSI layer.
2) sd should call START STOP UNIT on resume -- and as a SUPER BONUS, the 
combination of these two changes ensures that there are no queue 
synchronization issues, the likes of which would require hacks like 
Jens' while-loop patch.
None of these are huge changes requiring a lot of thinking/planning...
Finally, ideally, we should be issuing a hardware or software reset on 
suspend.
