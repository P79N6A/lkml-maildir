Not interesting in pursuing this path.  This has been discussed 
endlessly, check the archives.
We want the FIPS tests.  Hardware (especially cheap hardware) is often 
known to go haywire.  Trusting hardware to do the FIPS tests is pretty 
silly, since you're trusting the piece that might go haywire to tell you 
its OK.  RNGs have a history of suddenly providing non-random data, for 
a variety of reasons (usually poor board wiring).
We also want the userspace daemon because that gives the sysadmin far 
more control over how much entropy is added to the system.  99.9% of the 
cases in the real world, we don't want the RNG pumping entropy into the 
pool at full speed.  That will likely pump in more data than a system 
needs, chewing CPU.  The admin can't even kill the daemon to reclaim his 
CPU, if its all in-kernel.
It's not brain surgery, to concoct a method by which an interrupt-driven 
device is used from userspace.
