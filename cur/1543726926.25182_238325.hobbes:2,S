I did build it before sending it.  My initial submission to you
was based on 2.6.7 and you'd said it was applied.  My current submission
is 2.6.7 based too, and I didn't check for any driver changes since
you'd said you already applied it (although I couldn't confirm it since 
I did not know which bk tree you use).  The current patchset builds fine on
my setup on 2.6.7.  Please let me know what I missed so that I can take
care of such things in future.
Thanks,
Kiran
