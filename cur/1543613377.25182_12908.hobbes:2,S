That's more a glibc question. On many systems, you can set
FD_SETSIZE before including <sys/select.h> and the libs will
use that FD_SETSIZE from that point on.
With glibc, you can't do that. Well that's not entirely true, the
following works but is not portable and an unbelievable hack.
BTW, why not use poll() - it has no fd_set imposed limit.
BTW2 don't forget to increase the ulimit filedescriptor max,
and perhaps /proc/sys/fs/{file-max,inode-max}
