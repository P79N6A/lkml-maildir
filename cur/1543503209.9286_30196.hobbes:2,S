hi,
on my old 386 with a Coprozessor and a running "Hedwig" I
got that message :
Code 8b 4a 04 85 c9 74 20 8b 5a 18 8b 02 89 01 8b 0a 85 c9
74 08 
Aiee, killing Interrupt Handler
Kernel Panic - Attempted to kill the IDLE Task
In Interrupt handler - not syncing
Got this after telnetting from another inside host.
Got some errors before - everytime I called ifconfig, I got
a lot of Ooops! : 0000 Pointer.
Could anybody enligthen me, what this message means ?
Thanks for helping
bye
