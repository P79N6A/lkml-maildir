Hi,
due to a bug in pnpbios parser [1] I wanted to choose my configuration.
So I looked in Documentation/pnp.txt and tried to changed it with echo "manual
<depnum> <mode>" > resources, but it didn't work.
After looking in drivers/pnp/interface.c, I saw that is not implemented :(
So I try to modify the driver in order it use a good configuration. But for
using pnp_assign_resources that let you choose an other config, the device must
be disable, but when you activate a device with pnp_activate_dev, it call
pnp_auto_config_dev that change the config you choose before.
So you can't choose another configuration, without an ugly hack (dev->active =
0; to your change; dev->active = 1;)
Is that normal ?
