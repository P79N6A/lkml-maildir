I just increased everything to machine word size with the thinking that
that would be optimal for integer math. (is it more efficient to avoid
shorts on risc architectures?)

Thanks for pointing that out, I'll look at the sysctls and other
variables.

I'll take a closer look at this. In the mean time, it shouldn't break
anything by switching to longs, even if values > INT_MAX can't be set,
right?

Hmm. Would you imagine doing something like:
asmlinkage long sys_msgctl (int msqid, int cmd, struct msqid_ds *buf)
{
	...
	int ipc_version = 0;
	if(cmd & NEW_IPC64_FLAG) {
		ipc_version = 1;
		cmd ^= NEW_IPC64_FLAG;
	}
	...
If you'd prefer it this way I'll rewrite it.

My only concern with that is that it would obfuscate the locking in the
code, specifically the dropping of the spinlock before doing a
copy_to_user:
		if ( (cmd == MSG_STAT64) || (cmd == IPC_STAT64) ) {
			struct msqid64_ds tbuf;
			memset(&tbuf,0,sizeof(tbuf));
			kernel_to_msqid64_ds(msq, &tbuf);
			msg_unlock(msqid);
			if (copy_to_user (buf, &tbuf, sizeof(tbuf)))
				return -EFAULT;
How about rewriting the code as follows:
		/* NOTE: copy_msqid_to_user does msg_unlock before the
		   actual copy_to_user, dropping the spinlock so we can
		   possibly sleep in copy_to_user */
		if (copy_msq_to_user(msq, buf, cmd))
			return -EFAULT;
static void copy_msq_to_user(struct mgq_queue *msq, void *buf, int cmd)
{
	if((cmd == MSG_STAT64) || (cmd == MSG_STAT)) {
		struct msqid64_ds tbuf;
		memset(&tbuf, 0, sizeof(tbuf));
		/* do copying of fields, etc. */
		msg_unlock(msq);
		return copy_to_user(buf, &tbuf, sizeof(tbuf));
	} else {
		struct msqid_ds tbuf_old;
	...
	}
}
Thanks for your help,
