A good example of a reason for making a workqueue freezable is that the 
workqueue contains entries which would cause a suspended device to be 
resumed.  Obviously you don't want such things to happen while the 
system is going to sleep.  A little less obviously, there might also be 
problems if such a routine ran while the system was waking up.
Another reason might be that the workqueue contains entries which would
try to register or unregister a device.  Such actions aren't a good
idea at times when the PM core is iterating through a list of all
devices in order to suspend or resume them.  And in the future such
actions may block, effectively freezing the workqueue anyway -- which
could be troublesome if you don't want the workqueue to be frozen!
