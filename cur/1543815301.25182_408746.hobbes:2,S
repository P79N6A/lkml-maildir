I won't object.  I checked your tree, it looks OK to me.  The actual
broken patch appears in -mm, and the security_sid_to_context snafu
is primarily cosmetic at this point (the exports, etc fixed the real
compilation issues AFAICT).  But, again, if you want to drop that's fine
w/ me.  I'm sure Catherine can cleanup and resend as needed.
