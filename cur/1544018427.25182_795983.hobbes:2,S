These fragments, from native_pgd_val, certainly don't help:
c0120f60:       55                      push   %ebp
c0120f61:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
c0120f63:       5d                      pop    %ebp
c0120f64:       c3                      ret
c0120f65:       8d 74 26 00             lea    0x0(%esi,%eiz,1),%esi
c0120f69:       8d bc 27 00 00 00 00    lea    0x0(%edi,%eiz,1),%edi
That is really disgusting.  We absolutely should be patching away the
function calls here in the native case.. not sure we do that today.
