umm, that sounds like a mistake to me.  fscks tend to get run when there's
no swap online.  A small system with a large disk risks going oom and can
no longer be booted.  Whereas if the fsck relies upon kernel caching it'll
run slower but will complete.

Yup.  I was of course referring to fsck.extN.
