Yeah, absolutely _not_.
If we wouldn't pass the "struct page" around, we wouldn't have anything to 
synchronize with, and each nopage() function would have to do rmap stuff.
That's actually how nopage() worked a long time ago (not rmap, but it was 
up the the low-level function to do all the page table logic etc). 
Switching to returning a structured return value and letting the generic 
VM code handle all the locking and the races was a _huge_ improvement.
So yes, the modern "->nopage()" interface is less flexible, but it's less 
flexible for a very good reason. 
Quite frankly, I don't think nopfn() is a good interface. It's only usable 
for one single thing, so trying to claim that it's a generic VM op is 
really not valid. If (and that's a big if) we need this interface, we 
should just do it inside mm/memory.c instead of playing games as if it was 
generic.
