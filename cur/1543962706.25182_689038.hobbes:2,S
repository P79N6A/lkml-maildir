And this appears to have been a false alarm. For the tests I did a clean pull 
of the tree and started the build. When I kept *NOT* getting a build error on 
the clean tree I started checking permissions and, while the files that this 
error was happening for (and the containing directory) all had good 
permissions, the correct ownerand all that - so I didn't look deeper. On 
doing a deeper look it seems that there were some files and directories that 
belonged to "root" and had 0644 for permissions.
After doing "make mrproper" and the reconfiguration I reset the owner/group on 
the entire tree of files to be non-root and the build (at -j4) has finished 
without a problem.
Sorry about that.
