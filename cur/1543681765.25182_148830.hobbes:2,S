Someone reported this on bugzilla too, but i failed to reproduce it so it 
appears that perhaps something else died like the keyboard. I tried it 
last night on 2.6.0-test1 and i managed to login fine. It does appear that 
something else is dying. It'd be good if you could collect the last few messages 
from /var/log/XFree86.0.log and /var/log/messages and also perhaps 
/var/log/dmesg.
