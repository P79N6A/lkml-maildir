OK, thanks.
I'm 99.9% sure I've identified the problem correctly,
as it would effect the free list in precisely the
way necessary to cause an infinite loop when trying to
free the list.
My first suggested fix has problems, but there is

today (I've got a backlog of stuff to do here at
work before I can get to that.)
