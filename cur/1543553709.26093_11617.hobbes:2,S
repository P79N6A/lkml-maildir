>Is it possible to access symbols exported by modules from inside the kernel ?
Not via symbol name, the linkage goes module => kernel, not the other
way round.  Your module needs to register its data when it loads, then
any code can use the registration "get" function to access the data.
This works kernel <=> kernel, kernel <=> module, module <=> module.  Be
careful that you lock the module down while you are using its data.
See 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/2.4.0-test10-pre6-module-symbol.gz
 for
sample registration code.
