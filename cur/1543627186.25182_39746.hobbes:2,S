whoops.  I can't argue for its efficiency, can I?

Bah!!  :(  Where is a version-forwarder for this stuff?  8;)
and will it be dropped...
Your latter 2 sentences aren't related -- right?
On the 15 CPU-seconds in si_swapfile():  yes, I think
there is room for some improvement there.

|                 if (swap_info[i].flags != SWP_USED)
|
| and 2.5 has:
|
|                 if (!(swap_info[i].flags & SWP_USED))

OK, I'll try it Thurs.

We'll see about that.
