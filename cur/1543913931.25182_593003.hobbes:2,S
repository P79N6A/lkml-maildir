I also wrote in the same mail that the history of that could be verified
in the old CVS tree, after which it was obvious that there was nothing
explicitly stated that would contradict the terms of the top-level COPYING.
The + any later version stuff was never mentioned in any version of the
file dating back to 2.4.3 when it was first added in the CVS tree. Given
that, I don't see any reason why we should be adding it now.

Exporting accessors for use in the driver code is fine, exporting a
global lock is rather more ugly.

I don't know if I buy that argument, but as you're going to be more or
less the only user of this bus, I can live with that. At least update
your comment so it has some relevance.

What exactly is the AICA trying to do to the maple bus? G2
synchronization is one thing, but that's very different from
reinitializing the bus.
While Sega's hardware may be whimsical, a sound driver should never be
reinitializing an input bus.. that's just too bogus for words, sorry.
