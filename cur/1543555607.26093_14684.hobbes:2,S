Bloody interesting. I don't see anything recent that could affect the
areas in question. Intersting versions to check: 11-pre5 and 11-pre6.
It smells like buffer cache corruption, but I don't see anything
relevant. __generic_unplug_device() change loock pretty innocent,
ditto for bh_kmap() ones in raid5 and on ext2 side we had two obviously
equivalent replacements (pre5->pre6). No buffer.c changes, no VM ones.
Urgh.
