That looks like six, not two.  But that's the whole list.

I re-tried the macros ... the three warnings from mm/slub.c all result in
broken code ... and quite rightly too, they all come from code that does:
	atomic_read(&n->nr_slabs)
But the nr_slabs field is an atomic_long_t, so we shouldn't be using
atomic_read().  I didn't spot these last time around because I was using
slab, not slub for the previous build.
I think that I'll run into other build issues if I turn down the
optimization level (there are lots of places where the kernel relies
on optimizing away impossible cases in switch statements.
