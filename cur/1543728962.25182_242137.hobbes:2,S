Hi folks,
Is it possible that there is a problem with vfat on amd64?
This is the effect I see:
I want to flash the BIOS of my PC, so I have to write a bootable
DOS image on an USB stick and add the flash program and the new
BIOS file:
	cat DOS.img >/dev/sdd
	mount -t vfat /dev/sdd /mnt
	cp AWDFLASH.EXE FN85S235.BIN /mnt
	umount /mnt
The USB stick boots, but if I run AWDFLASH, then nothing
happens. It justs sits there and doesn't do anything.
But if I try this instead
	cp DOS.img FLASH.img
	mount -t vfat -o loop FLASH.img /mnt
	cp AWDFLASH.EXE FN85S235.BIN /mnt
	umount /mnt
	cat FLASH.img >/dev/sdd
then AWDFLASH works as expected.
Kernel is 2.6.8, but I had problems with 2.6.7, too.
???
