For crying out louf, all it takes is a finite state machine...  BTW, folks,
your parser *and* input language suck.  Really.  Silently allowing noise
is Dumb(tm).
Please, write the grammar down and _follow_ _it_.  AFAICS, trimming the
crap ("we have a number, skip everything until '/', whatever noise we
have there doesn't matter") leads to something like
text: (whitespace line? \n)*
whitespace: [ \t]*
line: label whitespace number whitespace (/ whitespace set whitespace)?
set: number (whitespace , whitespace number)*
label: [!-.0-~]{1,23}
number: [0-9]+
and even that might be too liberal.  For fsck sake, all you need is to
keep a struct that would contain
	* state
	* (partial) number
	* list of smack_known, with the first element being the partial one.
	* number of characters already seen in label (label itself stored
in the list head ->smk_known)
and that's it - just have a switch by ->state to handle the next character.
Allocate that struct in ->open(), modify in ->write(), apply the entire thing
at once in ->release().
Come on, people, this is ridiculous - why bother reinventing the wheels for
the stuff that belongs to exercises halfway through any self-respecting
introductory textbook?  Scary parser, my arse...
