This is even more complicated by the fact that upstream GCC release branches
(and also several Linux distributors) start announcing the upcoming version
already a few days after a release is tagged.
E.g. 14 days old gcc-4_1-branch says:
./xgcc -B ./ --version; ./xgcc -B ./ -dD -E -xc /dev/null | grep GNU
xgcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061114 (prerelease)

#define __GNUC__ 4
#define __GNUC_MINOR__ 1
#define __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ 2
but GCC 4.1.2 has not been released yet.
In Fedora Core/RHEL and I think a few other distros the version number
is only changed when it is officially released, e.g.:
gcc --version; gcc -dD -E -xc /dev/null | grep GNU
gcc (GCC) 4.1.1 20061011 (Red Hat 4.1.1-30)
Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

#define __GNUC__ 4
#define __GNUC_MINOR__ 1
#define __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ 1
#define __GNUC_RH_RELEASE__ 30
Note, 4.1.1 was released end of May this year and 4.1.2 has not been
released.  So, using __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ to detect if a bug has been fixed
or not isn't very useful (you'd need to rule out also __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ <= 1
because gcc-4_1-branch was announcing that patchlevel already since
beggining of March, on the other side there is a lot of GCCs with
__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ == 1 that certainly have that bug fixed).
You perhaps could parse the prerelease vs. release vs. vendor strings,
but that could be quite difficult, perhaps easier would be just parse the
date in the --version output.  Checking for the bug is best though, because
that will catch even backports of the bugfix without rebasing from the
release branch.
