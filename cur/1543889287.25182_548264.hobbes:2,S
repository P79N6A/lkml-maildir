Usually DMA is done via ZONE_NORMAL allocations. GFP_DMA allocs and 
ZONE_DMA are for devices that cannot performa DMA to all of memory.
There is no need to fall back if you do not have such devices. So no need 
for ZONE_DMA.

GFP_DMA allocations are an exception and that exception can be removed 
from the core VM by not defining ZONE_DMA. You cannot switch off the 
NORMAL zone.

Nope. The DMA zone is for crappy DMA devices that can only use a portion 
of memory.
