USB / Firewire / FC / iSCSI are all SCSI transports and fit within the
SCSI subsystem by design.
ie. Just like ethernet, DSL, T-1, etc can all carry IP traffic with no
conceptual conflict, many media by design carry SCSI traffic.
The PATA and SATA physical layer typically carry ATA commands and
having them tied into the SCSI stack is an aberration that I hope will
be eliminated some day.
ATAPI is an exception.  Not sure where that would end up in a perfect world.
