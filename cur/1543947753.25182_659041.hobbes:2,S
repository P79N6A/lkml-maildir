The ony way I see this was possible, you manually changed the
module loading order, so that the b43xx module was loaded prior
to the ssb and b44 modules. Right? Or the b43xx driver was built
statically and the b44 and the ssb as modules.
Looks like this, kind of, ruins my statement that is is impossible to get
working wifi in 2.6.24. Sorry, it was not intensinal. ;)
But there still are lots of valid combinations where the b43xx driver
silently won't work. E.g. when either the ssb or the b44 modules are
loaded prior to it, or when either of them are built statically (building
the b43xx driver staticaly won't help here). And my patch fixes them.
So, my statement goes, the bug stays. Agreed?
