I don't much like the vm as a way to determine association, but between
process groups and thread groups I would think that if there isn't useful
information perhaps something isn't working as desired.
I firmly believe that nice should be used to get uncommon behaviour, and
that the scheduler should do a decent job with most common loads, which
includes threads.
I hope to try K2 this weekend, I want to get get O1, rmap, and low
latency. If the latest O1 doesn't have child run first I want to add that
as well, barring someone providing a reason not to. I suspect I'll go
head down for some hours doing that, which is why I only evaluate multiple
features every few weeks :-(
