Ok. For a while i2c+sensors for me would freeze my box. Lately though
it has been slowing it down to a crawl. And by slow I mean I can see
the framebuffer console scroll block by block and be able to see 
individual lines half-scrolled and suchlike things. All is fine with 
the kernel until it hits the i2c and sensors code. Then it slows to
a crawl. By the look at the HD usage indicator it seems that it pauses
a second at a time (ie approx seconds pause, burst of activity, seconds
pause etc). This also happened before AS was merged into the kernel.
