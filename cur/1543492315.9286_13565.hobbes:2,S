The patch is avaliable at
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.5_arca8.bz2
 . I commented the
interesting changes in one passed email of the buffer.c-glitches thread
(the one where I say that the problem wasn't the flushtime timeout that was
too long, but that was the bdflush+mark_buffer_dirty that were not good).
If you have question let me know, I'll be glad to answer.
