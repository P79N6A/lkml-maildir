Hi,
     During bootstrapping,  bios provides services like video ,hard
drive services, memory sizing, PCI table to linux kernel.
     After uncompression of kernel , Does linux kernel have any
interaction with bios?
    I know that most of work is done by linux device driver. 
    What is dependency of running linux on bios ?
  Thanks in advance,
