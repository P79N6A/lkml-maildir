Not to mention MULTICS...
IMO this all looks like "exporting program variables to filesystem", would 
you do that? (Then we'll need /dev/memory/16k/5362337156/blah, etc.) The 
next issue would be "how do we stop other processes from using our 
sockets, semaphores, etc., ending up where we started.
Sockets are a good implementation as long as they don't fall down for some 
particular purpose. This isn't given yet. Semaphores didn't yet fall down, 
either. So what do you want more? The "old" system might look crappy to 
you, but it works! It works, even if it's a little more abstract than the 
Plan-9. Are we Plan-9?
Regards,
Thunder
PS. this mail was sent through a happily working lot of sockets.
