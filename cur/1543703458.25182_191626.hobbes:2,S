This does not defend against a dictionary attack.
The IV is still deterministic for a given sector and hypothesized 
password. 
Thus the ciphertext for a given plaintext at that sector is still 
deterministic.
Thinking of it another way, this is equivalent to CBC mode having two 
IVs: the first one being the sector number, the second a block of zeros.
