Is this a mail which you discuss ?

If so, the subject has 'Yen' Japanese character :-)
Here is a part of translation of the mail.

Believing the mail, it seems that the sender is not guilty, I think.
It seems that someone register the address of this ML on the web.
(Or the mail say a lie to hide the will of spamming? )
BTW, it is a good idea filtering by Content-Type: header or content
charset itself, I think.
Thanks.
