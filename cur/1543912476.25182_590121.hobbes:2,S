But isn't SATA related to SAS?  And isn't SAS using SCSI commands?  And
if ATAPI is essentially SCSI commands, and everything other then disks
use ATAPI on ATA, then that makes ATA disks the odd ball, and mangling
it into line with everything else isn't that bad (since all other ATA
devices are close to SCSI already).
