Yes, they are.  The parentheses which are part of the old assembly
string has the same effect as the asterisk operator in C.
The difference between the two is that the latter form allows the C
compiler to select the addressing mode, which allows the full range of
addressing modes, whereas the former forces it to use a single register
indirect.
