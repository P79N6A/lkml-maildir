That should be dealt with by reading the unique ID out of the devices'
ROMs after bus reset and let such high level code as block drivers
access the nodes through indirect handles instead of node IDs.  That
has the advantage that you always have the device you want (hey, even
SCSI IDs change when people meddle with them :-).  The disadvantage is
that the unique ID is 64 bits wide, and device nodes can't handle that
(unless we move to 128 bit device numbers...)
