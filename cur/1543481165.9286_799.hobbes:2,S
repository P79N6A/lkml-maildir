Well, there's one safe IP address, and that's 127.0.0.1, and "localhost"
works as a default hostname.
It makes absolutely no sense to ifconfig an interface without a valid
address that will work on the attached network.  The only default that
might make sense is to make a DHCP query; if somebody on the network
gives you an address, then use it, and do a PTR query[1] to get the
associated hostname.  If no response comes back, then leave the ethercard
down until somebody manually enters an IP number.  And the install
program should give a chance to make that manual setting, do the DHCP
query, or leave the machine off the network.  Some people do see the
sense in securing a machine before opening it for business.
[1] if the response includes nameserver IP numbers, then throw them in
resolv.conf, else start named locally.
