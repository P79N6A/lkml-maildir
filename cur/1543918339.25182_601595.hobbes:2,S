Does a doc exist that provides a detailed description of the different
errors that could be produced by libata and its associated drivers?
The libATA developer's guide provides a very good general description
of the types of messages, but I'm looking for more detail.
For example I got this error message last week:
Sep 27 17:29:26 server kernel: ata2.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0
SErr 0x0 action 0x1
Sep 27 17:29:26 server kernel: ata2.00: (irq_stat 0x40000001)
Sep 27 17:29:26 server kernel: ata2.00: tag 0 cmd 0xb0 Emask 0x1 stat
0x51 err 0x4 (device error)
I'd like to know what the following items means?
(irq_stat 0x40000001)
tag 0
cmd 0xb0
emask 0x1
stat 0x51
err 0x4
Can anybody help?
Thanks,
-Mike
