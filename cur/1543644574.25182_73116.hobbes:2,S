Hi.
I got a small question of what happens codevice when the quantum of a 
task is expired (counter == 0 -> need_resched == 1). Of cource schedule 
is invoked somehow, but from where? How is the "flow". I see from where 
do_timer is called, and that it schedules a BH, but then I'm stuck.
I have a feeling that some function is called (at least) each timer 
tick, which tests if schedules sould be called (a test on need_resched 
amongst others). I just cannot seem to find this function.
Any pointer appriciated.
