Git is as good at holding patches as quilt.  It isn't quite as
good at working with them as quilt but in the long term that is
fixable.
The important point is that we get a collection of patches that
we can all agree to, and that we publish it.
At this point it sounds like each group will happily publish the
patches, and that might not be a bad double check, on agreement.
Then we have someone send them to Andrew.  Or we have a quilt or
a git tree that Andrew knows he can pull from.
But we do need lots of review so distribution to Andrew and the other
kernel developers as plain patches appears to be the healthy choice.
I'm going to go bury my head in the sand and finish my OLS paper now.
