That's my point ii) below, which is what Thomas's patch is trying to 
address. I doubt you'd find much disagreement that this area still needs 
work :)

A better example than the ntpd daemon (which mightn't take kindly to 
finding minutes just passed in a blink of its eye) is Thomas's example 
with the sshd. If the daemon was swapped out you wouldn't be able to log 
into the box while it was thrashing, but in practice you can't really 
anyway. At least once the system had recovered sufficiently you could 
get back in, under the present system you can never log in again.

Well yes, in typical fashion everything depends on everything else. That 
in a nutshell is also my argument against the kill-me flag.
