Hi,
Running a 2.6.22 kernel and using the forcedeth driver with 
my ethernet card, I noticed this one is not available from
the gigabit section but from the 10-100Mbit section as
__nForce Ethernet Support__.

0.27: 19 Jun 2004: 
       Gigabit support, new descriptor rings,
       added CK804/MCP04 device IDs, code fixes
       for registers, link status and other minor fixes.

Shouldn't it be in the gigabit section ?
Did I miss anything, or maybe this is fixed in the latest 
kernel releases ?
I do not belong to this mailing list, so please, add my 
email address to your CC field.
Thanks.
