Sorry, I didn't get it....
   Completely reproducible (but I don't want to :-) e2fsck dumps core
   with a sig 11, just before it marks out 35GB /usr1 volume clean.  Core 
   file available on request.  It did this 3 times before I got round the 
   problem by zeroing out the check frequency field in /etc/fstab
Can you give me access to your machine, or otherwise give me a dump of
your filesystem?  I've gotten a few scattered reports of this, but not
enough information for me to really debug this problem.
