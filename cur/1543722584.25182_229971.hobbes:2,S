At least for stacking, I/we hope to submit two separate patches at some
point:
1. Permit multiplexing of kernel object security fields between multiple
LSM's, like trustedbsd's does.  Without this, many modules which it
makes sense to stack, cannot be stacked.  For instance, bsdjail and (as
of recently) DigSig, and either or both of the above with SELinux.
2. A (simpler than my current) stacker LSM.
But I definately hope they're heading into the mainline kernel  :-)
