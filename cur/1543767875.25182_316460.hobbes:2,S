We actually run memtest86 from the network regularly.  This cluster had run 
dozens of passes of memtest booted over the network before doing any of this.  
We also did an md5sum of our initrd from the network boot server, and then 
had the initrd do an md5sum of itself on the network boot.  They matched.  
Thanks for the advice though!  I appreciate it.
