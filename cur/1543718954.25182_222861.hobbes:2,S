This is truly bizarre.  Reading /dev/sda I get 24MB/sec at 700 context
switches/sec.  Reading /mnt/tmpfs/sda it's 14MB/sec, 7000 switches/sec. 
/mnt/ramfs/sda is slow too. /mnt/hda5/sda is fast.
I'd assumed that the kernel got the backing_dev_info's screwed up and the
tmpfs node isn't doing readahead but that appears to not be the case
(/dev/sda is still fast with zero readahead).
You really, really get the weird-bug-of-the-month award for this one.  I'll
poke at it some more later on.
