Subject: compile error when building multiple EHCI host controllers as modules

I was trying to build the USB EHCI host controller support as modules  
for a PowerPC 834x which also has an embedded EHCI (and PCI enabled).
I get the following build error:
In file included from drivers/usb/host/ehci-hcd.c:895:
drivers/usb/host/ehci-fsl.c:365: error: redefinition of '__inittest'
drivers/usb/host/ehci-pci.c:363: error: previous definition of

drivers/usb/host/ehci-pci.c:369: error: previous definition of

Which makes sense based on how ehci-hcd.c includes "ehci-fsl.c" and  
"ehci-pci.c".  I was wondering if there were an thoughts on how to  
address this so I can build as a module.
