All I have to test with are Dell machines, so I haven't been able to
try.

The trigger seems to be a combination of high network load, and high
system load.  The times it's happened to me, it's been while running
an app that has a couple of hundred threads, uses about a gig and a
half or so of memory, and does pretty heavy disk and network I/O.  I'm
still trying to find a job that can reproduce it reliably (or even
semi-reliably), and when I can, I'm going to try a switch over to the
e100 driver as some people have suggested, to see if that stops it
from happening.
