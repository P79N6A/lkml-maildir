Well, you could remove everything that is not valid kernel text from backtrace.
That should make ssh keys non-issue and still provide usefull information.
Oh and you probably want to somehow identify modified kernels.
Otherwise if I do some development on 2.3.4-foo5, you'll get many oopsen
caused by my development code... it is getting complex.
