There's certainly a correlation (sp?) between the two and it would be
ironic if it happened again. However, here's why I think it won't:
Noone uses old machines for very long. How many of you are still using a
PDP-10 (30+ years ago) or an Apple classic (20- years ago) for "real"
work?
I'll put my foot squarly in my mouth and predict that, in 38 years,
people will think that running anything on a machine less than 1GHz speed
for a production machine is nothing short of insanity.
But, then, there are always the hobbyists...but, then, they can "fix" the
kernel themselves? :)
