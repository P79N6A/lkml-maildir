And the stock subject came from your software too. It looks liek something
output '19100' and your script got bitten by the 1 character shift. I've
seen that sort of bug in a lot of perl

Interesting. The data is coming from the kernel but is caused by someone
misinterpreting a string and printing 19100, it looks like an application
perhaps APMD ? on your machine shifted the clock erroneously and the rest
of the system is behaving fine around it

I think so. It looks to me like an application screwed up and changed the
system clock. We don;t do the right things in kernel to cause the '19100' bug
