Even better.
That way you can actually totally remove the "verbose bug" config option,
because even the verbose BUG's aren't actually using up any noticeable

This is all assuming that gcc doesn't create the string for inline
functions that aren't used, which it probably cannot, so maybe this
doesn't work out.
