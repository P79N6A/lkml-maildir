In defense of this code, I ran -mm3 with the deadline elevator for 
about 3 days and was very happy with the interactivity.  Now I've 
been running with the elevator=cfq for most of the day, and it also 
seems to be pretty responsive.  The default as wasn't, at least for 
-mm2, and I haven't tried it yet for -mm3.  Should I, and report back 
in a day or so so that you've got reports from an otherwise identical 
system to compare?
We need a test suite for this :)
