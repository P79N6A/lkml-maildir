It works ... and dma-mapping.c is OK as a location for the
definition.  But there seemes to be some small scope for a
related cleanup:
There are "extern" declarations for "iommu_detected" in both
<asm/iommu.h> (x86 and ia64) and also in <linux/dmar.h>
Does having both of these avoid some #include hell?
