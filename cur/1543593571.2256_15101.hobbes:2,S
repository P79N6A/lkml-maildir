Bzzert. Wrong. It may easily block. open() from another thread might
grab that descriptor just fine.
If you close descriptors being polled - don't try IO on them once
select()/poll() returns. Regardless of aborting select().

Yes. So close() doesn't abort read(). Why would it?
Operations like read, select, etc. act of files. Not on descriptors.
