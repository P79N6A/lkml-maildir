Andrew,
the lock contention statistics, which have been added to -mm recently, duplicate 
code that we have in the statistics patches. I think I can slim the lock 
tracking patches further down considerably (similar to my attempt at 
timerstats). I have a working prototype that is getting some polishing brushes. 
Would you like to wait how this goes?
As to timestamp_clock(): its useful for statistics, but still a minor feature. 
It would be unfortuante if that was the stumbling block for my patches. Am I 
right that the fix for the issue pointed at by Adrian is to rename those two 
occurrences of printk_clock()? Do you want me to submit a patch?
