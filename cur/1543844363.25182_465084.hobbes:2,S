Honestly, I do think it would be positive.  It would shorten the 
feedback loop, and get more changes out to testers.
It would also decrease the pressure of the 60+ trees trying to get 
everything in, because they know the next release is 3-4 months away. 
It would be _much_ easier to say "break the generic device stuff in 
2.6.20 not 2.6.19, please" if we knew 2.6.20 wasn't going to be a 2007 
release.
