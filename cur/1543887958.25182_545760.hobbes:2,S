Please don't force sysfs on people.  Just watch how it keels over and dies 
when you end up with lots of disks/network interfaces on reasonably sized 
boxes.  16 statically allocated files per network interface starts being 
a problem once you've got a few thousand interfaces.  Anything that forces 
me to use sysfs is not gonna fly.
