	Bug's description :
	A computer has two ethernet cards connected to the same hub, each ethernet card was in a
different logical sub net and turn on the ip_forward on each ethernet card. Dozens of ARP request
packet will cause a "neibour table overflow"
error then the netcard can not work .
	reason:
	The arp_rcv fuction would call the ip_route_input function to build the dst entry of the skb.
When the ip_forward is on , the code will run direct into the rt_intern_hash fuction which add the
target ip to the neighbour buffer . 
	patch:
