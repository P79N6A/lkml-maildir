(.70, but I doubt that makes a difference)
Hi guys,
  I've been way out of kernel compiling for a long time, however I just
took a job writing device drivers on Linux so I guess I'll be doing quite
a bit of it again.  I've not built a kernel other than an occasional 'make
rpm' on redhat since the 2.0 days, so be gentle with me.
  The problem I'm having is with the kernel.  My environment is a standard 
Redhat 9 installation:
gcc-3.2.2-5
binutils-2.13.90.0.18-9
modutils-2.4.22-8
kernel-smp-2.4.20-9
  The problem I'm having seems to be related to modutils.  When I make 
very many modules I can't install the system because depmod can't find 
symbols undery 2.4.  However using nm I can see that those symbols are 
indeed defined.  If I make a bare bones system and only have the two or 
three modules I need (I'm working with SCSI device drivers and need to 
unload/reload the modules) the depmod passes, but the modprobe fails with 
QM_MODULES: function unimplemented.
  So, I went grepping through the source code and QM_MODULES exists in 
linux/module.h in 2.4, but not in 2.5.  Since modutils depends on that 
functionality heavily modutils must have been re-written.  However the 
latest version I can find on kernel.org is 2.4.25 and it still uses 
QM_MODULES.  So, where is it?
  Are there other things I'm going to need for 2.5?  I've already figured 
out LVM is totally different, and that breaks mkinitrd if I've got root on 
a logical volume.  Anything else?
  Thanks in advance for your time.
  Jay
