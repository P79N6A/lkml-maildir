Which caused IO, either synchronously or via (previously read)
readahead.

I see your point... and I much prefer the "majflt means IO performed"
definition :)
As a user I want to know how many pages have been read in from disk to
service my application requests.
From the "time" manpage:
F      Number of major, or I/O-requiring, page faults  that  oc-
       curred  while  the process was running.  These are faults
       where the page has actually migrated out of primary memo-
       ry.

Hum, I still strongly feel that users care about IO performed and not
readahead effectiveness (which could be separate information).
I don't think the semantics are precisely defined anywhere are they?
