I've now added a 'make headers_check' target which goes through the
resulting headers and checks that they are a closed set -- they don't
attempt to include any kernel header which isn't selected for export.
I've also committed enough header cleanups to ensure that the checks
pass, at least for ARCH=powerpc. 
In time, I'd like to see additional checks added, such as checking for
namespace pollution and perhaps attempting to compile each header
standalone.
Now that we can see the mess we have when we export it, there should be
plenty of fun pickings for kernel janitor-types. There's no particular
reason why those cleanups should come through my tree, although I'm
happy enough to collect them and to give accounts on git.infradead.org
to anyone who's going to make a habit of sending them.
