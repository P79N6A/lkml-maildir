2.4.5aa1 compiles fine, but 2.4.5 doesn't, don't know why yet. Please
backout this patch from 2.4.5 for now, this should be the right thing to
do in the long run:

Now I will start a robot that will tell me in some hour of computations
which of the patches in my tree actually makes me to need the above
patch to compile both generic and dp264 correctly. After I localized the
offender patch it should be very easy to found why I need the above and
2.4.5 doesn't.
