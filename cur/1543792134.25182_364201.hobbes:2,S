	In fact, it was meant to be part of saa7134 module. We've changed it on the newer patchsets I've sent to you today. It shoud compile well now.

	Only after sending I noticed you've released -mm1 (I'm suffering a long
delay on my current ISP - maybe some greylist policy). I'll apply the
patches I sent you today against -mm and, if something wents wrong, I'll
send you some correcting patches.
Cheers, 
Mauro.
