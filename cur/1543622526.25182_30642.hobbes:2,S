Because linux/Documentation/wavelan.txt says:
   "wvlan_cs" driver (Wavelan IEEE, GPL)
   -----------------
           o Config :      Not yet in kernel
           o Location :    Pcmcia package 3.1.10+
           o on-line doc : 
http://www.fasta.fh-dortmund.de/users/andy/wvlan/
and that page (@fasta.fh-dortmund.de) says:
   Download:Kernel 2.0.x / 2.1.x / 2.2.x:
    WaveLAN/IEEE Linux driver v1.0.4 (included in pcmcia-cs-3.1.15): 
   pcmcia-cs-3.1.15.tar.gz
    Linux wireless tools v19 (kernel 2.2.13 and earlier):
   wireless_tools.19.tar.gz
    Linux wireless tools v20 (kernel 2.2.14 and later):
   wireless_tools.20.tar.gz
 
   Kernel 2.3.x
    Note that kernel 2.3.x support is currently experimental.
    WaveLAN/IEEE Linux driver v1.0.4 (patch for kernel 2.3.50):
   linux-2.3.50-wvlan.patch.gz
    PCMCIA subsystem v3.1.15: pcmcia-cs-3.1.15.tar.gz
    Linux wireless tools v20: wireless_tools.20.tar.gz
 
and
   Since the linux kernel 2.4.x contains its own WaveLAN/IEEE 802.11 driver,
   this standalone driver is depreciated. Try David Hinds pcmcia package
   and/or the linux kernel driver (orinoco_cs).
   and orinoco_cs from 2.4.17 doesn't work, but wvlan_cs that came with my RH 
   kernel does.
but, I checked out the actual pcmcia-cs page, and it looks like I have to 
abandon my working PCMCIA stuff, is that right?
I'm open to suggestions.  Off list, if you don't mind, being as how I'm off 
topic now.
