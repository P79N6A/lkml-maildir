Heh. Considering that WinFS seems to be delayed yet more, I don't think 
that's a very strong argument.
Hell will freeze over before Microsoft does a filesystem right. Besides,
WinFS is likely almost in user mode anyway, ie mostly a library, rather
like the gnome people are already doing with nome storage.
So there's really no point in trying to push your agenda by trying to 
scare people with MS activities. Linux kernel developers do what's right 
because it is _right_, not because somebody else does it.
