Well, while you're  at it: it would  be nice it uname(1)  "-p" would return
the processor type as  on Solaris et al. Of course  this involves glibc and
sh-utils, not the kernel, but when implementing this feature you could just
keep an eye on what is needed for this to work
Don't let yourself becoming discouraged by thos procfs proponents: a lot of
people are with you on this on!
Just my two cents (Yes, we have them in Euro-land too!)
