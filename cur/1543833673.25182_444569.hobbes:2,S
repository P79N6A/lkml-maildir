Both are troublesome. I forked off vmstat.hy from page-flags.h
and all my attempts to straigthen things out results in other problems
so I finally gave up and just did the same for vmstat.h.

page-flags.h also seems to be included from the arches 
for various purposes. 
grep page-flags include/asm-*/*
include/asm-ia64/cacheflush.h:#include <linux/page-flags.h>
include/asm-ia64/pgalloc.h:#include <linux/page-flags.h>
include/asm-ia64/uaccess.h:#include <linux/page-flags.h>
grep page-flags arch/*/*/*
arch/s390/appldata/appldata_base.c:#include <linux/page-flags.h>
mm.h gets too big. It would be best if we had some smaller granularity and
page-flags.h should be pretty much stand on its own.

Great if you can detangle that.
