Subject: file kernel/signal.c, 2 * array subscript out of range

Hello there,
I just tried to compile Redhat Fedora package
kernel-2.6.12-1.1435_FC5 with the Intel C compiler version 8.1
The compiler said
kernel/signal.c(196): warning #175: subscript out of range
The source code is
        case 4: ready  = signal->sig[3] &~ blocked->sig[3];
Clearly broken code. Array sig has only _NSIG_WORDS elements,
which is set to two on this architecture.
Suggest rework code to use _NSIG_WORDS as the upper limit, not
a fixed constant.
The compiler also said
kernel/signal.c(197): warning #175: subscript out of range
on the next line of source code.
Regards
David Binderman
