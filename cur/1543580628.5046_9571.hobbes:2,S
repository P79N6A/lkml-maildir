i have no bits directory, but those definitions are not in my resource.h
or types.h.
I know this is crude, but:
	grep rlim_t /usr/include/*.h /usr/include/*/*.h
	/usr/include/*/*/*.h /usr/include/*/*/*/*.h
returns nothing. /usr/include/linux does link to the linux source too.
Ditto on SYS_capset.
when bind can't find SYS_capset, it does do #define SYS_capset
__NR_capset
the compilation returns that __NR_capset is undeclared.
the only __NR defines i can find are in /usr/include/asm/unistd.h
and capset isn't in there.
