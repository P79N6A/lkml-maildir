As I understand the way doubly linked lists are implemented in Linux, I
think that the corruption exists even if you are only adding items to
the list. Each struct dmi_device contains a list_head which points to
the previous and next items in the list. If you add a struct dmi_device
that was already in the list, you are overwriting this list_head with
new pointers and you lose the pointers that were originally there. This
means that you have created a "shortcut" from one list item to another
item that is further in the list, and the items in-between them are no
longer reachable.
