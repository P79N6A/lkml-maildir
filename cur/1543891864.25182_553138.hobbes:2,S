I have added cfs15 to the chart at 
www.tmr.com/~davidsen/sched_smooth_05.html and updated the source of the 
test at www.tmr.com/~public/source if anyone wants to run test on their 
hardware.
I feel that on my hardware cfs-13 was the smoothest for this test and 
for watching videos. Even relatively light load:
   nice -10 make -j4 -s
of a kernel would cause jumps on the video, gears or youtube.
