Hi,
Here are 4 small fixes for some USB serial driver issues.  They have
all been in the 2.6 tree for some while now.  Pete suggested I send
these directly to you, instead of having to go through him.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/usb-2.4
The individual patches will be sent in follow up messages to this email
to you and the linux-usb-devel mailing list.
thanks,
greg k-h
