I was about to check this in when it occurred to me that it should be
possible to simply define the no-ops as "static inline".  If you take
the address of these functions, the compiler will instantiate the
function automatically, so this ought to work both for GENERIC and
non-GENERIC kernels.  The only downside is that for GENERIC, each
machvec definition will get its own definition of the
no-op-function(s), but that seems like an acceptable cost to me.
I tried the patch below both for zx1 and GENERIC and it does seem to
work as expected.  If nobody has a problem with the patch, I'll go
ahead and check it in.
