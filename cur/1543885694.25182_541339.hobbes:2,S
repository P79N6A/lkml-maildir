No. Annex H (informative!) only talks about LIA-1 conformance.
C99 isn't LIA-1 conformant. H2.2 describes what an implementation
might do to make signed integers LIA-1 compatible, which is
what gcc does with -fwarpv or -ftrapv.
At least that's how I understand it, the C99 standard
seems to have been written with the "it was hard to
write, so it should be hard to read" mindset. :-/
I still don't know _why_ signed integer overflow behaviour
isn't defined in C. It just goes against everyones expectation
and thus causes bugs.
