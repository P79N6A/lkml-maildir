Andrew,
I forgot to mark this patch, the high2lowuid fix for __convert_uid,
to which I am replying now:
	Signed-off-by: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
You're welcome to pick this patch up, so mark it and run with it.
But as you can see, I did little building and no testing.  Nor
do I have any plans to do more.
So if you want more expertise, building, testing or assurances, then
you'll probably have to complain and ask (whom, I don't know) for more.
