there is no serious breakage issue, since the extra fields would
not break any competent parsing code.

nah.  changing APIs and internals is exactly the reason Linux wins.

perhaps you've mistaken this for a Windows mailing list.

aesthetics is good, but here, what point would it serve?
tools would simply need to parse two separate files.
the point is that the files are inherently parallel.
if this aesthetic were followed, most of /proc would need to 
be transplanted into /system-info or something.  again,
serving no practical purpose.
