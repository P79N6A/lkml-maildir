Yes, making the ACPI layer more hotplug capable is something that should
be worked on again.

Yes you are right. I thought _PSR could always be called at init time,
whether present or not (which would certainly work for most/all devices
as _PSR info should be kind of static), but ACPI spec forbids it:
6.3.7 _STA (Status)
If bit 0 is cleared, then bit 1 must also be cleared (in other words, a
device that is not present cannot be enabled).
A device can only decode its hardware resources if both bits 0 and 1 are
set. If the device is not present (bit 0 cleared) or not enabled (bit 1
cleared), then the device must not decode its resources.
I only saw:
6.2.10 _PRS (Possible Resource Settings):
If the device is disabled when _PRS is called, it must remain disabled.
But disabled and not present are different things...
It's stupid as the possible resources of a device will always remain the
same, whether it is present or not, but if it is written down in the
spec, there is not much to argue about it...
Thanks,
