I am sorry to say, I cannot help you. This is the department
of Manfred, most likely. The 95% bet is that your BIOS is crap,
and you have to poke ASUS. However, you might want to explore
a possiblity of a bug. The best way to do it is to run "mptable"
program to dump the table and then get someone who makes
a sense of the data. Try to figure out who wrote the code
to support AMD IRQ router. He may be the culprit (5%, but...)
