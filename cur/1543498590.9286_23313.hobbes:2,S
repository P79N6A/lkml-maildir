I have confirmed a problem with PIII.patch as posted by Doug Ledford a
day or so ago.  On a dual PIII system, running 2.2.9 + PIII.patch
+ nfsv3, I sometimes see corruption of the XMM registers in a user
program.  It seems to show up when the system has started to use swap
space.
I have CONFIG_X86_FX and CONFIG_X86_XMM turned on.
My user program initializes %xmm0..%xmm7 to contain floating point
values 0..31.  Then, once each second it reads these registers and
prints them out.  Here is what I am seeing:
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26

As you can see, the first four have been clobbered, but later were fixed
(not by me).  I did not see this behavior until swap was used.
I will turn off CONFIG_X86_XMM (which enables the XMM instructions in
kernel code) to see if the problem goes away.
