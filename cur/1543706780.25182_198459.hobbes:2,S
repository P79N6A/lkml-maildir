Add shared libraries and this distinction gets much less clear, at least
from a static analysis point of view.

While this is interesting, it quickly hits limitations.  Many programs
will need to open/read/write, for example.  So mediating at the syscall
level is only moderatly useful.  LSM gives finer grained mediation points,
and something like SELinux using LSM allows you to do what you've done,
and is much more flexible.
