This has already been wacked around quite a bit, but the fact remains
that every so-often, some college student (who never worked a day
in her life) or her instructor (who never worked a day in his life)
publish some hair-brained idea that a lot of folks believe must
have some merit because it came from MIT or Berkeley, etc.  Anybody
who's in the IEEE Computer Society can get monthly unworkable or
unusable dissertations from the college community about new ways
to do things. Once every 10 or so years, one of these writings
ends up having some merit. The "layered" model is way too old.
You want to use the new gene-splicing techiques for software
development. Basically, you build a filter that completely
defines the end product required. Then you set the monkeys loose...
Cheers,
