Sorry about that.  I'm happy to change retain_initrd to keep keepinitrd.
I don't think many people are using retain_initrd anyway (other than me
and some people I work with).
Otherwise we can support both for a while with something like (and
Robert's patch)....

Make keepinitrd the same as retain_initrd for backwards compatibility
with ARM/AVR32
