If the swap-in problem exists.
I can see it being triggered artificially because we still
unmap too many pages in the pageout path, but if we fix
shrink_cache() to not unmap the whole inactive list when
we're under continuous memory pressure but only the end of
the list where we're actually reclaiming pages, maybe then
many of the minor page faults we're seeing under such
loads will just disappear.
Not to mention the superfluous IO being scheduled today.
regards,
Rik
