Subject: [PATCH] preserve ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE in the build directory generated Makefile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch ensures, that architecture and target cross-tools prefix
is preserved in the Makefile generated in the build directory for
out of source tree kernel compilation. This prevents accidental
screwing of configuration and builds for the case, that make without
full architecture specific options is invoked in the build
directory. It is secure use accustomed "make", "make xconfig",
etc. without fear and special care now.
