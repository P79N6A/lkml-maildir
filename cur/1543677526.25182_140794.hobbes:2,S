Hi Mikael,
I just download perfctr 2.5.5 and see the difference
between 2.5.4 and 2.5.5 but I could not find code
changes except the changelog and todo.

+Version 2.5.5, 2003-06-15
+- Updates for driver model changes in kernel 2.5.71.
+- Minor updates to the library's event descriptions for Pentium 4.
+- Now supports SuSE's 2.4.19.SuSE-206 kernel for SLES 8 users.
+  Autodetection of SuSE kernel versions is not yet implemented:
+  pass "--patch=2.4.19.SuSE-206" to perfctr's update-kernel script

+- Patch kit updates for 2.4.21 final and 2.4.20-18 RH kernels.

 Version 2.5.4, 2003-06-01
 - Corrected the driver's handling of OVF_PMI+FORCE_OVF counters
   on Pentium 4. This configuration didn't work at all, and

 Changes during perfctr-2.5:
+- SuSE kernels don't use EXTRAVERSION. Fix update-kernel to use
+  rpm to identify the exact version instead.
 - New AoS counter state layout:
        struct perfctr_cpu_user_state {
                unsigned int cstatus;
