KCORE_BASE is my fault ... it was an attempt to fix the "modules
below PAGE_OFFSET" problem for the ia64 port.  For a few nanoseconds
the code just here looked like this:
#if VMALLOC_START < PAGE_OFFSET
#define	KCORE_BASE	VMALLOC_START
#else
#define	KCORE_BASE	PAGE_OFFSET
#endif
Which worked great for ia64, but failed to even compile on i386
(because on i386 VMALLOC_START isn't a simple constant that cpp
can compare against).
Linus kept the bulk of my patch and just replaced the above code with
the "#define	KCORE_BASE	PAGE_OFFSET" that is there today, maybe
in the hope that I'd come back with a workable #ifdef ... but the only
one I've come up with so far is "#ifdef CONFIG_IA64" which can't be
right as ia64 isn't the only architecture with this issue.
There was some discussion on a better way to do this, by adding the
kernel itself to the vmlist, and eliminating all the special case code.
I took a brief look at this, but realised that there were all sorts
of ugly race conditions with /proc/kcore if a module is loaded/unloaded
after some process has read the Elf header.
