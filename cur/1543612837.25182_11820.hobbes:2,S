This looks reasonable. 
A couple of notes:
1) The minimum safe ramdisk address is 8MB (since 2.4.10).  On low
   mem machines you can get away with placing a ramdisk lower.  But we
   don't do any checking in our initial 8MB memory map.
2) If we use units of kilobytes instead of bytes for this we don't
   loose any precision and gain the ability to put a ramdisk in high
   memory without bumping the protocol version.
3) If we are going to export the maximum address we should also export
   the minimum address.
