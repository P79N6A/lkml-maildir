Subject: scsi/zip mounting problem with 2.4.0-ac4/6 (at least)

Alan and All,
I've detected a bug somewhere in 2.4.0-acX, at least in ac4,
the first ac kernel I built.  It seems that I can't mount
a scsi zip disk in, unless the following has occurred:
1.  There is a disk in the zip drive when I boot.
2.  I fdisk the scsi block device and re-write the partition
    table.  (I accidently discovered this).
in other words I get this:
mount: /dev/sda4 is not a valid block device.
If I try to insert a zipdisk and mount it after I boot up.
This problem does NOT occur as late as 2.4.0-final.
Specifics of my system:
The SCSI board is a real cheap SYM810A based Fast SCSI-2 PCI board.
I use the sym53c8xx driver built in, as is scsi disk support.
The only thing I use the scsi board for is the external zip 100
drive.
It still occurs in ac6.  (I've only build ac4 and 6).
Here is the specifics from a dmesg of 2.4.0 booting:
(2.4.0-ac4 and 6) is the same.
