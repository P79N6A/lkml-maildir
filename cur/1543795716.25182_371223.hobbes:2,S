Unfortunately there are some applications that will now start
to see errors from this ioctl if we go this route - whereas
before they would've been "functional", now they will break.
So, I think we need a different solution here.  Yes, I agree
its a stupid call to have on Linux, but here we are, and apps
ported straight from IRIX have been made to use this.
cheers.
