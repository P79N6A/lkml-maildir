Subject: Remove net_dev_init from linux-2.4.9/drivers/block/genhd.c?

	linux-2.4.9/drivers/block/genhd.c contains a call to
net_dev_init, which appears to be unnecessary, because net_dev_init
will be called automatically by the first call to register_netdevice
if net_dev_init has not already been called (register_netdevice is
in net/core/dev.c).  So, I just removed the call to net_dev_init
from drivers/block/genhd.c, and the resulting system seem to be
work fine, but I thought I ought to ask if anyone sees a specific
problem with doing this, and if that problem would be avoided by
just putting a "module_init(net_dev_init);" line at the bottom of
net/core/dev.c.
