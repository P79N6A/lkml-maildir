yes :-) I have a really ugly workaround in my tree that is definitely 
not worth posting. I think to do this cleanly i'll add trylock_kernel(), 
and do this in main.c:
   BUG_ON(!trylock_kernel());
but there's another one that is much nastier in terms of scope:
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/mutex.c:256
in_atomic():0, irqs_disabled():1
 [<c0103db6>] show_trace+0xd/0xf
 [<c0103dcd>] dump_stack+0x15/0x17
 [<c011ff4b>] __might_sleep+0x64/0x6c
 [<c105b470>] mutex_lock_interruptible+0x15/0x22
 [<c013d81f>] __lock_cpu_hotplug+0x26/0x52

 [<c013d922>] register_cpu_notifier+0xc/0x2b

 [<c1d992ee>] start_kernel+0x125/0x376
 [<c0100210>] 0xc0100210
this is what is causing the ppc64 problems too i think.
lock_cpu_hotplug() has design problems i think: hotplug-locked sections 
are slowly spreading in the kernel, encompassing more and more code :-) 
Shouldnt the CPU hotplug lock be a spinlock to begin with?
