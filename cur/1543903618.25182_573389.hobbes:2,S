Yes, this is not related to -rc1, we've had this problem for some time,
but it does require some reworking of how we do page colouring in order
to clear it up. I have some patches for this, but they've triggered some
problems on older cores, so this is still something that's being
debugged. I'll send you some stuff off-list you might want to try for
SH7750/SH7091, unfortunately you have a direct-mapped cache, so it
doesn't trigger some of the regressions that we've seen on other parts
with those patches.

This however looks a bit strange,  the r4 value implies that we're not
getting the proper pointer for some reason. I'll try and reproduce it on
some other boards and start digging in to it, thanks for the reports.
