I am unconvinced.  If you take ~1MB/s for each active drive, add in SCSI 
overhead, 45M/sec seems reasonable.  Have you look at a running iostat 
while all this is going on?  Try it out- add up the kb/s from each drive 
and see how close you are to your maximum theoretical IO.
Also, how's your CPU utilization?
