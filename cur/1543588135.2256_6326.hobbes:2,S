But it is.  The more false positives I get in the dead-symbol reports,
the harder it will be to spot real problems like that business in the 
ARM kernel.c file.
I grant you this wasn't a problem before I wrote kxref.py, but it is
one now.  New tools create new opportunities, but they sometimes require
better discipline and working practices to be useful.  This is one of
those cases.
