This piece of code from include/linux/spinlock.h (linux-2.4.3) works
around a compiler bug with empty initializers. Does anybody know if this
bug has been fixed in gcc-3.0?
/*
 * Your basic spinlocks, allowing only a single CPU anywhere
 *
 * Most gcc versions have a nasty bug with empty initializers.
 */
#if (__GNUC__ > 2)
  typedef struct { } spinlock_t;
  #define SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED (spinlock_t) { }
#else
  typedef struct { int gcc_is_buggy; } spinlock_t;
  #define SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED (spinlock_t) { 0 }
#endif
