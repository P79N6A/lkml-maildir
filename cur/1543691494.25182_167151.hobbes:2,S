Hi,
Our sampling driver kernel module which uses these hooks is GPL
and could be included in the kernel.org tree.
The current version of the driver (also GPL, but which hooks the
sys_call_table for 2.4.x-based kernels) is posted at,
  
http://www.intel.com/software/products/opensource/vdk/
We plan to post our new driver for kernel 2.6.0-test5 (with the
event notification patch applied) on both IA-32 and IA-64 to the
above site early next week.

If the code which uses these hooks is included in the kernel.org tree,
yes.
If the code which needs the hooks is not in the kernel.org tree then
people
can patch the core kernel at the same time as adding the performance
analysis patch.
If the code which needs these hooks is not appropriately licensed then
these hooks basically constitute a GPL bypass and that is not a
direction
we wish to be heading in.
