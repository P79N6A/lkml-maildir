There is just one problem: linuxthread stacks are just ordinary mappings
and they are in no way special to the kernel; they aren't VM_GROWSDOWN. 
You would need to add a way to the kernel first to tag the linux thread 
stacks in a way that is recognizable to mlockall and then do that 
from linuxthreads. 
I think for the normal stack - real VM_GROWSDOWN segments - mlockall
already does the right thing.
