Yeah, please try it on another machine from clean tree.  sysfs code is
definitely not endian dependent and is 64 bit clean.  Heck, all my test
machines run 64 bit these days.  I would be surprised if it's something
architecture dependent but please try on a different machine with
different userland with kernel built from fresh source tree.
Thanks.
