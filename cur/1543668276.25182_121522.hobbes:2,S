I keep getting these messages in the kernel log:
KERNEL: assertion (newsk->state != TCP_SYN_RECV) failed at tcp.c(2229)
KERNEL: assertion ((1<<sk2->state)&(TCPF_ESTABLISHED|TCPF_CLOSE_WAIT|TCPF_CLOSE)) failed at af_inet.c(689)
It seems to be related to accepting an incoming connection.
The kernel is 2.4.21-pre4 on Alpha.  The machine is behind a firewall
that forwards connections so some ports to this machine.
