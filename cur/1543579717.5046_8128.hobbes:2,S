This is the wrong way of going about things -- you should probably insert
the pages into the page cache and write them into the filesystem via
writepage.  That way the pages don't need to be mapped while being written
out.  For incoming data from a network socket, making use of the
data_ready callbacks and directly copying from the skbs in one pass with a
kmap of only one page at a time.
Maybe I'm guessing incorrect at what is being attempted, but kmap should
be used sparingly and as briefly as possible.
