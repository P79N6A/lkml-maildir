Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The reason for breaking up one CSA patch into four patches was
so that the only CSA (
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/csa/
) specific
thing is the csa_module. My intention is to improve the system
accounting data collection and make the data available to any
clients that can use the data. The three areas of accounting
data we try to improve are io, mm, and per-process area.
As Tim said the problem of BSD accounting was that it has been
inactive for a long time. I do not mind incoporating the
three accounting data collection patches i submitted into BSD or
others as long as the data made available to modules that plan
to make use of the data. :)
Thanks,
