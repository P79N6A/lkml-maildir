OK. But AFAIR Sun just hangs when you insert an audio CD...

And hangs hard (or screams at you) if it happens not to be formatted, or
part of a multivolume tarball, or a non-MSDOS diskette. At least some
versions of SunOS got wedged and the floppy drive became unusable until the
next reboot.

Mechanically retaining the floppy is not there for PCs, sorry.
This idea sounds nice, but is _extremly_ hard to get to work right. How do
you format a diskette with this kind of setup? Do a rawrite? Create/use
multivolume tarballs? Handle different (perhaps even alien) filesystems,
esp. one that is handled by userlevel programs (something like mtools(1))?
