Landed in -mm tree. Thank you, Andrew.
Happy testing, everyone. Your `acks' are required!
If something wrong with
-- external modules building on `ro' source tree (distros),
-- wrong CC options (arch maintainers),
-- wrong localversion(s) included (Debian ;),
-- something with initramfs or object list (makelst) generation,
i'm listening.
Thanks !
