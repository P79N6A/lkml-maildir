Still not correct, I beleive.
The problem is that you are changing timer->base = &new_base->t_base
without holding new_base->t_base.lock, this is racy vs timer_del().
Suppose we are calling __mod_timer(pending_timer):
__mod_timer() locks old base, deletes the timer, changes timer's base,
unlocks old base.
Another cpu calls del_timer(). It is possible that this cpu will
see the new value of ->base == new_base before it sees changes in the
timer->entry. It locks new_base, but this is not enough, because the
timer was removed from list under the old base's lock and we don't
have a proper serialization. So it is possible that del_timer() sees
that the timer is still pending, and will try to delete it again.
In other words, in this scenario __mod_timer() and del_timer() will
take 2 different locks trying to serialize access to common data.
You can solve this with memory barriers, but this will be pessimization,
not optimization (you will also need smp_rmb in lock_timer_base()).
Honestly, personally I don'like this patch even if it was correct.
It complicates the code, and the only win is that it removes
'if (likely(base != NULL))' from the fast path, I doubt this is
noticeable.
Also, __mod_timer() becomes "non atomic", but probably this is ok.
Btw, I think you have the same problems in "[PATCH 2/9] ptimer core".
Oleg.
