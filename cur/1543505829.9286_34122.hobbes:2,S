Definitely.  That is why the current system still has so many direct
memory references (incorrect as they are), and explicit calls to mb()
and friends.
Since decisions are getting made about this stuff, what is a coherent
strategy for bus-specific addressing?  ie. I want to ioremap() PCI
device A on bus 1 at 0x0C000000, and also ioremap() PCI device B on bus
2 at 0x0C000000.
Regards,
