I'm inclined to agree.  When I login to the machine as root, no other
machines are mounted and it seems reasonably stable.  The fun begins when
logging as myself, triggering automount of my home directory from a second
box.  Things explode quite rapidly then, usually on the first operation
which tries to create/(re)write a file on the server (xdm & .Xauthority,
mc and ~/.mc/ini).
