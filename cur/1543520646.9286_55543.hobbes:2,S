I know this probably doesn't help but "me too" - one of many problems
yesterday trying to get Oracle installed on my home machine.
fsck also reported "file has deleted/unused inode".
Kernel here is 2.3.32, interestingly this is also a dual Celeron machine
(2x400Mhz not overclocked, 256MB, ASUS P2-BD motherboard, IDE disks,
ext2, 2k blocks) so either dual Celerons or maybe just SMP seem to be
implicated.
