Strictly spoken, only Linus updates MAINTAINERS. Everybody else merely
sends change requests which are forwarded or rejected. If newbie John
Doe finds there is something missing in MAINTAINERS, he could send a
proper patch *to the proper contacts*, et voilà. In short, people
including John Doe updated MAINTAINERS.

Note, if people build scripts which look up contacts, I hope they don't
become careless and forget to search elsewhere for proper contacts if
_no_ contact was found automatically.

When I wrote "somewhat costly" I didn't refer to a 1:1 mapping between
.c and .o. That's not what it takes. I mostly referred to having to
implement a parser for parts of the Linux Makefile language. On the
bright side, the more indirection you introduce, the less people will
write their own scripts and the less scripts with bugs will be out
there. :-)

Doesn't need to be F. "Files" happens to start with F.
