Subject: [PATCH 2/39] NLKD - an alternative early ioremap approach

An alternative to (on i386) boot-time ioremap approaches, which is more
architecture independent (though arch dependent code needs adjustments
if this is to be made use of, which with this patch only happens for
i386 and x86_64) and doesn't require alternative boot-time interfaces.
