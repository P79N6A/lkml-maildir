My algorithm idea is to have two states: idle, and warned. When memory
gets tight, give a warning shot (SIGQUIT), and change to warned. When the
memory gets even tighter (there must be a second threshold), give a final
shot (SIGKILL). Just like these zap guns they use at Stargate SG1 ;-).
Rik's code has the limit numbers as kernel magic numbers, I'd like more to
have a /proc/sys/vm/ entry for them. But that can wait until I get the
thing working.
With a useful setup, tight memory is so far from ordinary operation, that
all this really should never happen. This should only happen when there is
really a malicious program attacking the machine (or a program that has
gone wild). If it really happens during normal operation, add a new swap
partition, or better buy more RAM.
