You cannot mount without replaying even in read-only mode, because
file-system meta-data are possibly inconsistent.

There is a patch allowing to mount reiserfs if there was io error during
journal replay on mount. It is included into 2.4.9-ac* tree (it was sent
to Linus several times, but this did not avail).
Can you send to Reiserfs mail-list <Reiserfs-List@Namesys.COM> more
detailed information about your case, like ksymoopsed stack trace, etc.
