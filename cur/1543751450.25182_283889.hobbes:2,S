The way to do this is to fix up the callers first, in just ten or so
patches.  Then mark the function deprecated when most of the conversion is
done.
If we deprecate the functions first then 10000 people send small fixes via
various snaky routes and it's really hard to coordinate the overlapping
fixes.  The s/MODULE_PARM/module_param/ stuff did that, because we made it
warn first, then I held the big sweep patch off for 2.6.11.
