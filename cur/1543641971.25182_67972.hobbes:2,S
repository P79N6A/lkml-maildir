Attached is a patch against 2.4.20-pre5 that updates the se401 driver to
update it to version 0.24.
This fixes the inline problem, a memory leak on disconnect and disables the
button for cameras that don't support it.
I haven't been folowing 2.5 for a while, but I think it will apply without
problems.
