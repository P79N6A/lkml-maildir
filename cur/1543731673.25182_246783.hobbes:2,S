He is not sole author. Large parts of the code are based on other
authors work and simply copied from the standard framework. Please put
back the version without the hooks. It is useful to all sorts of people
in that form.
When the author GPL'd it he gave up his rights to remove it. Expecting
people to clean-room reverse engineer GPL source is a joke.
