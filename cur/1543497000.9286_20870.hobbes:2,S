  OK. I agree that the problems with size can be dealed somehow.
Still there is an issue of speed. Going through lists in hash bucket
costs us really a lot... Probably I'll write it and try to do some
tests...

  I agree that 16-bit IDs must be removed. But 32-bit will be
hopefully available in 2.3 using current design too as support
for files <4GB will be done. I'm not refusing the idea of some
more clever structure. I'm just saying it's good to think twice...
