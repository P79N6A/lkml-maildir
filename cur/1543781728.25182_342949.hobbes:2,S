Yeah, I use macros to call all the debugger code and spinlocks to
protect them. The macros change when the module is built into the kernel
to not do any protection, since it isn't needed.  It's not the most
efficient thing, and RCU would probably be better. But I can insert and
remove this module over and over with the debugging going on, and it
hasn't broke yet. But I guess, I'll just do without for now.
