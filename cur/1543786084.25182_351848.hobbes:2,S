Thats only partially true. 
Granted, the most used time in user space is clock_realtime
(gettimeofday() / clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME). 
But do we really want to discuss one add instruction ?
The most used time in kernel space is clock_monotonic. 
Thats partially a result of the rather odd POSIX specs regarding
relative CLOCK_REALTIME timers. 
Also the basic prerequisite for for high resolution timers is a fast and
simple access to clock_monotonic rather than to a backward corrected
clock_realtime representation. 
Kernel code speed in hot pathes must have precedence over code executed
on behalf of userspace if its not completely out of bounds. One add/sub
is definitely not.
We should rather ask glibc people why gettimeofday() / clock_getttime()
is called inside the library code all over the place for non obvious
reasons.
