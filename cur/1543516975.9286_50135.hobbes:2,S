  Ooohh, thank you (I'm lucky not to use it till now I came to it yesterday...).
  Is there any documentation about it (I'd like to have it worked but maybe it'd
  be corrected in the next kernel update...) ? I tried Documentation/filesystems
  but still haven't a clue...
    Thank you very much, anyway :-)
      Cheers,
