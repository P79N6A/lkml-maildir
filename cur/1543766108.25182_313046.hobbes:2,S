Because to build m68k kernels, you (still :-( have to use the Linux/m68k CVS
repository, cfr. 
http://linux-m68k-cvs.ubb.ca/.
BTW, my patch queue is at
http://linux-m68k-cvs.ubb.ca/~geert/linux-m68k-2.6.x-merging/.
The main offender is POSTPONED/156-thread_info.diff.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
