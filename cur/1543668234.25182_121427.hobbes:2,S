I know.
I was wondering, since we are working on an actual bug here, whether or
not renicing X is leading to a starvation issue between X and whatever
is starving.  I have seen it before.
My system is responsive, too, and I do not renice X.  But it might
help.  Or it might cause starvation issues.  We have a bug somewhere...
