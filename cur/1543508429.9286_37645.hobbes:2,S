i have to agree with all of this -- using queued signals is not a win in
terms of application complexity.  add to this that the C library will want
to use signals for its own purposes, and there is no standard way for an
application to discover what signals are already in use.
gaurav banga and jeff mogul presented a paper at the june usenix technical
conference which describes a new kernel API for scalably managing I/O
events.  the link:

niels provos here at the scalability project has designed a new version of
poll() that provides callbacks to device drivers so that poll() doesn't
have to scan a list, it simply waits for the callbacks.  he has ported
this to a late 2.3 kernel, and is testing it.  is anyone interested in
helping to test?  is this something we want to get into the kernel?
