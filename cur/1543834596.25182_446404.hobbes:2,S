Sorry, but doesn't compile if DVB_BUDGET_AV is set :(

This patch is the culprit. With it, the build fails with the errors : 
drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-av.c: In function 'frontend_init':
drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-av.c:1063: error: 'struct budget_av' has no member named 'reinitialise_demod'
drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-av.c:1068: error: request for member tuner_ops' in something not a structure or union
drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-av.c:1068: error: 'philips_cu1216_tuner_set_params' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-av.c:1068: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-av.c:1068: error: for each function it appears in.)
The needed changes were introduced post 2.6.17 :

This would be great to see this fixed for the next -stable release :)
