This indicates someone has broken the memory allocator and it is passing non
ISA DMA memory to the sound driver. The driver takes great pain to catch this
because a broken ISA DMA allocator in the kernel is likely to cause
memory and potentially disk corruption with some old ISA controllers.
I'll take a look. This could easily be that the bigmem code has broken the
ISA DMA tests many drivers use rather than the memory allocator handing back
wrong pages.
