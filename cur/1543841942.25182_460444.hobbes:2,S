Can't see where to set this one, from the kernel/panic.c notifier chain?

drivers/char/vt.c:
...
static void blank_screen_t(unsigned long dummy)
{
        if (unlikely(!keventd_up())) {
                mod_timer(&console_timer, jiffies + blankinterval);
                return;
        }
        blank_timer_expired = 1;
        schedule_work(&console_work);
}
Looks like the place to stop the screen blanker, that's as far as I'm game 
to travel.  
Hooking the panic notifier chain looks too scary for this little black duck ;)
