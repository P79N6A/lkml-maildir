Hi,
	I have a strange problem(or is it normal).I have a Redhat 6.1
System with 2.2.12-20 kernel.After I start X, the message
"VFS : Disk Change Detected on ide0( 3, 64 )."
keeps on coming.But ide0 is my harddisk.The messages won't come when I'm
not running the X server.Recently when I booted with a 2.3.x kernel, the
problem disappeared :) Does any body know WHY? What is not there in 2.2.x
kernels that is there in 2.3.x w.r.t IDE disks?
TIA.
Srinath.
