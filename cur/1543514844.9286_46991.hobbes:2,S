Sure it is.  This is why, if you want a clean abstraction, you shouldn't
use the buffer cache --- the buffer cache is not _meant_ to map cleanly
to data, it is meant to map cleanly to specific disk blocks.  The page
cache is Linux's logical cache, and the buffer cache is its physical
one.  Don't blame the buffer cache for not doing what is better done in
the page cache.

Sure there is --- as I wrote before, read buffer.c:brw_page(), which
performs IO with async callbacks, bypassing the buffer cache entirely.
