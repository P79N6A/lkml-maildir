The problem appears only in rc2 (okay, assuming it's not a
regression).  With 2.4.21-rc1 the file corruption I've been seeing does
not happen.  From what Stephan has said I think I should try some more
varied tests.  At this point I plan to do that a little later; I will
also try an rc2 with unnecessary features omitted from the build.  So
far I've stayed with the base config, but it's a config shared by most
of the machines on the LAN and thus has plenty of extras.
