fixed to use generic code.

we are also not very happy with it. We will not complain, but try to simplify it.

The reason is performance. Reiser4 uses a search through the filesystem tree to
access metadata of a file.
If reiser4 implemented its read/write via generic functions it would have to
repeat the search for every page being read/written.
It is especially disappointing because reiser4 uses extents with which it is
able in most cases to find all file pointers to data blocks with only one search
through the tree.
Another reason is multithread load.
Tree search includes complex part of providing correct concurrent read/write
access to the tree including deadlock avoidance algorithm. On multithread
filesystem load minimizing of a number of tree searches should have improved
filesystem throughput.
These are on todo list yet.

We hope to improve that with your help
Thanks
