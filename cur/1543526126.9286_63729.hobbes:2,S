Had a look on netfilter ? I think not, it covers the items you asked.
It's in 2.3.xx kernels (note many network driver changes are going on at
this moment)
Have a look at: 
http://netfilter.kernelnotes.org/
PS, ever looked at the load of the system when ipchains+logging are used,
and "someone" attacks your machine at 100Mb speed ?
(kernel has no problem,syslog does, and netfilter can handle this problem
as well)
Greatings,
