But I would need exactly the same number of pagefaults if I implemented
the "mark-dirty-on-write" logic in userspace using SIGSEGV and signal
handlers, as it is done by the LPSM software...

But if the kernel would turn a private copy of a c-o-w page into a
"dirty"-page that is marked for writing out to disk, another process
could mmap() the very same page even before it has been written to disk,
while if I write out dirty pages using write() in userspace, other
processes probably won't notice before all the data has reached the disk,
which could take quite some time.
And unlike the user space application, the kernel knows which writes
go to which physical disk so it can e.g. make better use of striping.
