The problem seems to have been accidentially introduced by DaveM's
"simplification" of my original patch.
I've already asked Dave to revert his change and apply my original
patch (see attachment), which _should_ fix the problem.
Thanks,

[NETFILTER] x_tables: Fix XT_ALIGN() macro on [at least] ppc32
To keep backwards compatibility with old iptables userspace programs,
the new XT_ALIGN macro always has to return the same value as IPT_ALIGN,
IP6T_ALIGN or ARPT_ALIGN in previous kernels.
However, in those kernels the macro was defined in dependency to the
respective layer3 specifi data structures, which we can no longer do with
x_tables.
The fix is an ugly kludge, but it has been tested to solve the problem. Yet
another reason to move away from the current {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tables like
data structures.
