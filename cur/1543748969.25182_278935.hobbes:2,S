Indeed. You'll notice that gcc doesn't even put stdarg.h in /usr/include, 
it's in the compiler-specific header file directory, usually something 
like /usr/lib/gcc-lib/<vendor>/<version>/include.
We used to compile with "-nostdinc" to make sure that you couldn't include 
user files even by mistake, but that was removed for some reason I can't 
for the life of me remember any more.
We probably should do it again. Something vaguely like
	CFLAGS += -nostdinc -I $(CC -print-file-name=include)
should do it (and still pick up "stdarg.h").
