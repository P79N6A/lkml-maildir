This patch makes GAMEPORT required, while actually it's only required
to not be a module if the sound driver is builtin. See my earlier mail
on the subject for the details:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106479206731633&w=2 
A better fix would be to revert the change in sound/pci/Kconfig from
CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT to CONFIG_GAMEPORT back to
CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT, or just drop this dependency for ALSA and let
the #ifdefs in the code take care of it. Forcing the gameport to be
compiled in when it's not necessary is bloat, IMHO.
