As you can see from the CC I've send you, I've just mailed my private army of 
testers / known uguru users, requesting them to send me the output of dmidecode 
on their uguru mobo's. Once I have this info, I'll see if there is some 
consistency in the manufacturer DMI field.
I've mailed them, since the DMI info is needed anyways to put uguru detection 
in sensors-detect, but I'm not sure I want to add this to the driver too. Many 
other ISA drivers do io probe's too, if a users decides to start loading random 
drivers, he is asking for problems, should we really even try to protect 
against this?
Regards,
Hans
