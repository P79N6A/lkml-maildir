kgdb has a script that tells gdb where each module is loaded.  AFAIK it
uses add-symbol-file FILENAME -sSECTION ADDRESS, the __insmod entries
contain enough data to tell gdb what is going on.

You need 13 bits of data per module.  Where each of text, rodata, data
and bss sections were loaded, you cannot assume they are contiguous.
The length of those four sections.  Where the module is on disk, you
cannot assume the object name is the same as the module name, insmod
-o.  The timestamp and kernel version of the module when it was loaded,
to detect updates after the event.  All of that is encoded in the
__insmod entries in /proc/ksyms, 5 lines per module.

Rule 1.  Users do not read documentation.
Rule 2.  You can't do anything about rule 1.
If you want complete bug reports, write a script that forces the user
to submit all the required data.  Why do I feel the "Linux should have
a bug reporting system" thread starting again?
