    No, that's different.  You are referring to stat.st_blksize.  That is a
    different animal, and we can leave that alone.
    inode->i_blksize is equal to (1 << inode->i_blkbits) always, all the time. 
    It is just duplicated nonsense and usually leads to poorer code -
    multiplications instead of shifts.
    It should be a pretty easy incremental set of patches to ease i_blksize out
    of the kernel.
Hmm. Let me first read stat.c.
generic_fillattr():
	stat->blksize = inode->i_blksize;
vfs_getattr():
	generic_fillattr(inode, stat);
	if (!stat->blksize)
		stat->blksize = s->s_blocksize;
cp_new_stat64():
	tmp.st_blksize = stat->blksize;
	copy_to_user(statbuf, &tmp, sizeof(tmp));
So really, if inode->i_blksize has a nonzero value,
this value is returned in stat.st_blksize.
Remains your other claim: inode->i_blksize == (1 << inode->i_blkbits).
I don't see any code that would enforce that.

[and there are lots of comments around:
	inode->i_blksize = PAGE_SIZE;   /* This is the optimal IO size ... */
]
Maybe also a good candidate for renaming if it is not eliminated?
