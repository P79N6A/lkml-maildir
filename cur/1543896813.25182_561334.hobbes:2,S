You havent been watching it too closely i guess :-) The -rt kernel often 
pops up regressions before mainline does, especially when it comes to 
arcane hardware often used by embedded vendors [ =B-) ]. It even 
triggers certain high-end scalability and race bugs before the mainline 
kernel does, due to its unique scheduling behavior.
So yes, -rt obviously does not have as wide of a tester basis as the 
mainline kernel (but it's by no means small), it nevertheless has a 
tester base that is partly orthogonal to the mainline kernel.
Furthermore, -rt has a wide enough tester base for it to know that if 
something has not caused problems in it for years is certainly at least 
a good indicator that something isnt going to cause drastic problems ... 
which was the point to begin with.
