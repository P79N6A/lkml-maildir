Sorry if you missed the rest of the discussion, but the above statement was a 
rebuttal of the "The GPLv2 intended to guarantee me the right to run the 
software on any given piece of hardware" argument that has been used as the 
justification for the addition of the "tivoization" language to the GPLv3. As 
I stated, I fail to see how "running" the program is, in any way, intended by 
the license, since it *explicitly* states that it only covers "copying, 
distribution and modification". The exact place where it does that 
is "Section 0, paragraph 2, first sentence". I'll quote it here again:
"Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope."
