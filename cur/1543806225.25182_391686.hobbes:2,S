This function is not inlined.
Adding a test and a branch is a matter of 7 bytes.
  'Bloating the icache' is a litle bit off :)
Avoiding an atomic is important. This is already done elsewhere in the kernel, 
in a inlined function with *many* call sites :
(See kfree_skb() in include/linux//skbuff.h )
/*
  * If users == 1, we are the only owner and are can avoid redundant
  * atomic change.
  */
/**
  *      kfree_skb - free an sk_buff
  *      @skb: buffer to free
  *
  *      Drop a reference to the buffer and free it if the usage count has
  *      hit zero.
  */
static inline void kfree_skb(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
         if (likely(atomic_read(&skb->users) == 1))
                 smp_rmb();
         else if (likely(!atomic_dec_and_test(&skb->users)))
                 return;
         __kfree_skb(skb);
}
This is a valid optimization : an atomic_dec_and_test() is very expensive.
