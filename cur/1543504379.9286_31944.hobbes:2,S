No?  But you want to eliminate all spin_locks. Even if we ignore that:
       P0 obtains a lock A in 5 instructions and sleeps.
       P1 obtains a lock B in 5 instructions and blocks on A
       P2 blocks on B
If P2 is RT then P0 must be promoted. For P2 to be able to promote P0 there must be some
way of finding P0  and making sure P0 does not wake up and release the lock before it is
promoted. We also have to make sure P0 unpromotes itsself on lock release.
Here's one error case that those 5 instructions must prevent
      P2 puts itself on the queue for B
      P2 looks at P1 state, promotes P1, and determines P1 is waiting on A
      P2 looks at A and determines A is locked by P0
      P0 restarts on a second processor and releases A
      P2 promotes the priority of P0, needlessly.
      P1 is running on a second processor and unlocks B
      P2 sleeps on B. Now P0 and P1 have the wrong priority indefinitely, P2 has missed a wakeup ...
Oh oh. We need a bunch of locks here to keep our locking algorithm from screwing up. 
Or consider a simpler case:
     P0 gets lock A and sets A->owner=P0
     P1 starts to lock A on the second processor
     P1 sees A is locked and reads A->owner == P0
     P0 releases A
     P2 locks A and sets A->owner=P2
     P0 promotes P0 incorrectly
So in those 5 instructions,  we need a reader lock on the owner field ...
We haven't yet touched on the topic of releases. Instead of clear_bit, we now
need to figure out whether we were promoted while holding the lock, and what our new
priority should be. 
I can't figure out how to do all that in 5 instructions.

I may be wrong, but I have heard of the problem.  Thanks.

See above.

O(1) is a dangerous measure. 2^{1000} is O(1). There is a reason why UNIXs have
traditionally not followed the N priority queues model of process scheduling. And it 
is not because priority queues are esoteric knowledge.

If you can't read postscript, I can send you PDF.
