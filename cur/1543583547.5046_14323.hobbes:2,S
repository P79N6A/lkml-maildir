lseek and write does it already and need not to duplicate with truncate().
Using truncate() to extend a file sounds very strange.
About mmap() SUSv2 says:
If the size of the mapped file changes after the call to mmap() as a
result of some other operation on the mapped file, the effect of
references to portions of the mapped region that correspond to added or
removed portions of the file is unspecified.
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^
What do you mean about "useful in combination with mmap()" ?

Let's don't connive to ill-formed programs.
