Sorry ?
I remember, that for some month I have gotten minimum 15 SPAMs per
day from this List. Siche two (???) month it is very silent here..
I think, there was an Admin which had changed the SPAM-Filter setings.
But one thing:
I an subscribed with two E-Mails to this list, the first one is
secret and get all the mails from the List... SPAM is very rarely.
The second E-Mail is, which I use to post here... and on which I
get per day between 300 and 6000 SPAMs.
I run my own spamassassin on my FileServer for all incoming Messges
and see only 5-20 messages coming through my filters.
Same for the 56 Debian mailinglist where I am subscribed.
I do not know, what happen if kernel.org and debian.org deactivate
the filters... maybe the Internet connection will not sufficiant to
distribute the SPAM.
Greetings
Michelle
