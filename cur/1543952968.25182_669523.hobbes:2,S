Subject: [PATCH 1/4] pids: de_thread: don't clear session/pgrp pids for the old leader
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Based on Eric W. Biederman's idea.
Unless task == current, without tasklist_lock held task_session()/task_pgrp()
can return NULL if the caller races with de_thread() which switches the group
leader.
Change transfer_pid() to not clear old->pids[type].pid for the old leader.
This means that its .pid can point to "nowhere", but this is already true for
sub-threads, and the old leader is not group_leader() any longer. IOW, with
or without this change we can't trust task's special pids unless it is the
group leader.
With this change the following code
	rcu_read_lock();
	task = find_task_by_xxx();
	do_something(task_pgrp(task), task_session(task));
	rcu_read_unlock();
can't race with exec and hit the NULL pid.
