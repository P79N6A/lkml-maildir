Yes, that's the design intent.  Pass the call down the stack and across the
devices.

It could be true if the top-level I/O scheduler is tuned to support a large
number of in-flight requests (eg: CFQ).  For example, all the user memory
which direct-io places into request queues is pinned for the duration of
the I/O, so it might be possible to temporarily cause a memory squeeze with
enough processes doing the I/O.

Oh.  slab structures can only be in lowmem.  I thought that you were saying
that the actual I/O data was being copied, and only into lowmem pages.

It's definitely the first step to be taken.

You'd need to do some arithmetic.  If a machine has 32G of highmem and 0.5G
of lowmem and if DM is allocating some lowmem memory on behalf of that
highmem memory then yes, it's possible that all of lowmem will be consumed
to support that highmem.  In which case additional throttling/clamping will
be needed somewhere.
But note that on such a huge highmem box the VM/VFS will no longer permit
40% of memory to be dirtied - the dirty_ratio is reduced on such machines,
in page_writeback_init().  So that lessens the likelihood of
lowmem-exhaustion-due-to-highmem-writeout.
