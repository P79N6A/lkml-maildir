Yes.

Matt copied from shmem.c, so blame me.  Strange cast because it's one
of those IS_ERR things, an -errno hiding inside a pointer, and it's
being propagated from an initialization error on shm_mnt to a runtime
error on any struct file for that mount.  I wrote (void *) because it
seemed to express the ambiguity better than pretending struct file *.

But there's no fd associated with it?
