Hi,
I'm doing some work on TCP and can't work out why calcuation of the
TCP checksum is split between tcp_v4_checksum_init (net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c)
and tcp_checksum_complete (net/ipv4/tcp.c), at least for packets >= 68
bytes (why this threshold?).
If I want to run a TCP checksum (pseudo header + TCP header + data)
independently of the current TCP code, should I just do:
tcp_v4_check(	skb->h.th,skb->len,skb->nh.iph->saddr,skb->nh.iph->daddr,
		csum_partial((char *)skb->h.th, skb->len, 0))
	);
or do I need to call tcp_v4_checksum_init followed by tcp_checksum_complete?
Thanks -- Mark
