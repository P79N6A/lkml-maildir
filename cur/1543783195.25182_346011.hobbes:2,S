Didn't find that. Anyway:
The firmware has four parts. Each starts at a nice round number and is 
padded to the next one with zeros.
        0x000000-0x0fffff 560 kB
        0x100000-0x15ffff 316 kB
        0x160000-0x1bffbf 331 kB
        0x1bffc0-0x1bffff  64 bytes ASCII identificatoin
Each of the first three large parts starts with this sequence of bytes:
        00 10 00 00 03 00 00 00 ED
The first and third parts contain a repeating 7-byte sequence
        81 40 20 10 08 04 02
near the beginning, while part 2 is padded with zeroes in the same
place.
There are no strings except in the last part. Most likely it's
some kind of compressed data, although the repeating parts would appear
in regular compressed blobs.
Anyone, does this ring a bell?
