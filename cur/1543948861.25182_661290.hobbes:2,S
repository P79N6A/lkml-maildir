Which "same file" is that?

Sure, I'll change /KERNEL_DOC_VERBOSE/ to /KBUILD_VERBOSE/ in
scripts/kernel-doc.  docproc doesn't need to be involved,
especially since scripts/kernel-doc is easily usable without docproc.
That also means that I can just use the existing KBUILD_VERBOSE
documentation.  :)

Honor the environment variable "KBUILD_VERBOSE=1" (as set by
make V=1) to enable verbose mode in scripts/kernel-doc.  Useful for
getting more info and warnings from kernel-doc.
