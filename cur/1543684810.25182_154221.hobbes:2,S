Hi !
the fundamental problem as i know it is that the FS design in unix is based on 
a directory TREE structure - however if you implement hard links for 
directories you are breaking this strict treeu structure and can end up with 
loops/graphs.
(What are the cases where a symlink wouldn't be enough ?)
Cheers,
    Chris
