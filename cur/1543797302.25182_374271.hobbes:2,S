The stack moves down! It cannot go below the heap without destroying
malloc()ed buffers. I note that the heap also was "dynamically" moved
down to accommodate this, but its lower limit can't interfere with
_end[], the end of initialized data (fixed by the compiler and
data-size in the program).

An 8 megabyte variation is absolutely insane. It follows the "If a
little is good, more must be better..." theory. The purpose of
the random stack start, initially proposed by me BTW, was to
prevent stack-exploit code from being able to hard-code addresses
on the stack. Being off by one byte is enough, 8192 was originally
discussed and, I thought, adopted. Eight megabytes is absurd and has
no technical basis.
