Why do I feel like I'm being baited...? :-)
I would have to suspect that if a version string exists, that it has at
least some meaning to the primary developers/maintainters.  It certainly
is beyond my control to force the maintainers to give meaning to their
version strings.
Is this a political statement against the MODULE_VERSION macro and/or
its purpose?  I'm not overly interested in debating that one...
