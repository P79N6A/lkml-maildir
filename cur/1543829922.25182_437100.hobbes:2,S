It has been a success, look at the numbers:
2.6.0     : 36 options depending on BROKEN_ON_SMP
2.6.17-mm2: 17 options depending on BROKEN_ON_SMP
2.6.7-mm7 : 20 drivers with warnings due to check_region
2.6.17-mm2:  3 drivers with warnings due to check_region
It's not that everything was fixed immediately, but there is definitely 
some progress.

There are few drivers generating many warnings, e.g. stallion+istallion 
alone give 138 __deprecated warnings only for cli/sti/restore_flags 
usage. Most of the code doesn't have any problems.
And my main motivation for getting virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt removed is 
the following:
If the virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt are fixed, Andrew might finally accept my 
patch to add -Werror-implicit-function-declaration to the CFLAGS (which 
he only rejected since it turned link errors into compile errors in his 
ppc64 builds). 
And -Werror-implicit-function-declaration is important since it will 
turn some nasty to debug runtime stack corruptions into compile errors.
