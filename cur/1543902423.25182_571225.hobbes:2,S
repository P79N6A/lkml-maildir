What if we will force the specific device to the end of the list. Once
IRQ_NONE was returned by the other devices, we will mask the irq,
forward the irq to the guest, issue a timer for 1msec. Motivation:
1msec is long enough for the guest to ack the irq + host unmask the irq
+
cancell the timer. (ping round-trip for a guest is about 100msec)
If the timer poped, it will unmask irqs + run over the device list to
check
whether one of them has a pending irq.
This will solve the deadlock possiblity in a small price of potential
latency.

The problem is that each device has its own bits and it cannot be a
general solution.
Except that the device driver inside the guest should be changed because
the host already
disabled the irq/status for them.
I know the above solution in not neat but we do want to contribute it.
Any other ideas are welcome,
10x, Dor.
