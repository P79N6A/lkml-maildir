I still think this sucks: we end up with a fairly pointless-looking wrapper
API which we wouldn't have put in the kernel except for messy legacy
editing-is-too-hard reasons.  In an ideal world, it'd be better just to get
in and do the hard work.
Anyway.  Please fix the many correct warnings which checkpatch.pl
generates, reissue the patches with a decent overall changelog (this series
had no rationale for the changes at all) and we'll see what happens.
Thanks.
