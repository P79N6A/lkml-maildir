Then I'm confused by the code in 2.4.1pre8:
-chris
/*
 * Move the page from the page cache to the swap cache
 */
static int shmem_writepage(struct page * page)
{
	int error;
	struct shmem_inode_info *info;
	swp_entry_t *entry, swap;
	info = &page->mapping->host->u.shmem_i;
	if (info->locked)
		return 1;
	swap = __get_swap_page(2);
	if (!swap.val)
		return 1;
