I am looking at the CONFIG_MODVERSIONS mess, and I have a question
about this function:
    /*
     * Gets the address for a symbol in the given module.  If modname is
     * NULL, it looks for the name in any registered symbol table.  If the
     * modname is an empty string, it looks for the symbol in kernel exported
     * symbol tables.
     */
    unsigned long
    get_module_symbol(char *modname, char *symname)
    {
	...
    }
This function is used in only two places:
    drivers/net/8390.h
    drivers/isdn/divert/divert_procfs.c.
In drivers/net/8390.h, "load_8390_module" uses get_module_symbol.
Looking at the callers of load_8390_module, I see that callers can use
get_module_symbol to achieve delayed name binding, like this:
    /* drivers/net/wd.c */
    int __init wd_probe1(struct net_device *dev, int ioaddr)
    {
	... probe for wd ...
	if ( ... wd found .... )
	    load_8390_module("wd.c");
    }
Someone please tell me if my understanding is correct here.
Ok, now for the putative bug.  If the 8390 module was compiled with
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS on, then its public symbols will be decorated with
"foo_R12345678" style signatures.  get_module_symbol doesn't know anything
about decorations.  So, if CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is on, get_module_symbol
will return "no match", and this clever dynamic loading of 8390.o
will fail.
Note that 8390.o works when resident because it's an L_OBJ, not an LX_OBJ,
so that all of its symbols are treated as EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS.  But it
will fail if, for instance, ne2000.o and 8390.o are both modules and
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is turned on.
Is this ringing any "aha!" bells for network driver maintainers?
I suppose the cheap fix would be to make 8390.o an M_OBJ rather than an
MX_OBJ.  A less devious version is to convert all of its EXPORT_SYMBOL
calls to EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS, with a little comment on them.  A
straightforward, but limited, solution would be to give up get_module_symbol
and simply allow all these drivers to load the little 8390.o driver
when they load instead of doing fancy delayed loading.
I believe drivers/isdn/divert/divert_procfs.c will have the same
problem dynamically loading proc_register and proc_unregister.  In this
case, I think the simplest solution is to give up using get_module_symbol.
(I got interested in this because I am writing a new CONFIG_MODVERSIONS,
and this piece of code really puzzled me.)
