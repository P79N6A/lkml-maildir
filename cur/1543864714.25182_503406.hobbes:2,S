When did I ever say "one platform"?  If I did, it was an error -- I've
tried to consistently talk about not every platform.

So what?  Greg didn't restrict his offer to "mainstream" devices.  And
Greg said "[the driver] will be automatically kept up to date and
working through all Linux kernel API changes."  Not "we'll maintain
the driver until we lose interest."  And anyway, if I dig for a few
minutes I find modern mainstream stuff like ipw2200 that is seemingly
x86-only.  (Although of course ipw2200 is straight from Intel)

Perhaps "disingenous" was the wrong choice of word, though, since you
and Greg seem to sincerely believe that a spec dump is all that a
vendor needs to do.  I'll concede that maybe I should have used the
word "naive" instead.  But I absolutely feel that Greg should not be
making promises on behalf of "the Linux kernel community."
Go back and reread Greg's original email.  He said:

Let me repeat Greg's words one more time: "All that is needed is some
kind of specification."  So I honestly don't know what you mean by
"open specs was not the sum toto of Greg's piece."
Here is what he promised once that spec is released:

To me, it's clear that historically the community hasn't delivered on
this.  So I don't like promising something that we haven't been able
to follow through on in the past.  If a vendor takes Greg's offer, and
then the community, for whatever reason, fails to deliver on
everything, then that makes us all (including me!) look bad just
because of Greg's hyperbolic promises.
