The latest version (which is still quite old) is at
http://www.sf.net/projects/linuxjail
 and does have ipv6 support.  The last
time I submitted it, Christoph had objected to the way the networking was
done in general.  I've tried twice to float a generalized "per-process
network namespaces" patch, but haven't really found a good approach.
I suspect that the best approach would be to take the linux-vserver
ngnet implementation and convert it to a standalone network namespace
plus virtual network device implementation.  Do you care to give this
a try?
thanks,
