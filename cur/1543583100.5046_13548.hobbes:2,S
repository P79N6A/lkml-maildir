Subject: 2.2 -> 2.4: /proc/net/tcp 10x slower ?

Usually identd's on Linux parse /proc/net/tcp.
When migrating from Linux 2.2.17 to 2.4.2 identd became much slower.
I traced it back to the point where /proc/net/tcp is read.
On the same slightly loaded system:
2.2.17 $ time cat /proc/net/tcp >/dev/null
real    0m0.004s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.010s
(Or sometimes 0.000s due to granularity)
2.2.17 $ time cat /proc/net/tcp >/dev/null
real    0m0.083s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.080s
Is this expected? Or is there a more efficient interface that identd
should use?
