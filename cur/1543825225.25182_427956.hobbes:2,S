Yeah, hostname --fqdn is so broken:
joshua@numenor:~$ hostname
numenor
joshua@numenor:~$ hostname --fqdn
numenor
joshua@numenor:~$
My normal take is not to use the FQDN as the hostname because it
becomes too long.
If I ever need to know my outside-facing IP address, I connect a UDP
socket to 1.2.3.4
and to a getsockname(). To get outside-hostname, I do a reverse-lookup on that.
Since 1.0.0.0/8 will never be allocated, this is gauranteed to work
when there is a way out.
If there's no way out, I'll find that out too.
