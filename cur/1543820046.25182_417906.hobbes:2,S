Yes, but to a _file_ on the partition (ie he didn't overwrite any existign 
data, just the empty parts of a filesystem).
I realize that it's not enough for the "re-allocate on write" behaviour, 
and for that you really _do_ need to re-write the whole disk to get all 
the broken blocks reallocated, but my argument was just that we should 
make sure to _tell_ people when they are overwriting all their old data ;)
