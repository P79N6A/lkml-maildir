Could you also give me some clear direction on where you want me to put
my 2.4 port. Should it go in kernel/power, or somewhere else? (I'm
assuming you don't want 3 versions of swsusp?!). I'd like to put it in
the right place when I start populating swsusp25.bkbits.net, so you're
not pulling changesets later that only move the code around (I know bk
reduces the cost, but...).
Regards,
Nigel
