What does the pppd version have to do with it?  The modem controls the
channel bonding internally.

Well, here I am.
Channel-bonding works perfectly on my 3com Impact IQ, with pppd 2.3.5,
using both Linux 2.1 and 2.2.  Why on earth would it fail to work?  I
can't think of a reason.

I don't even think there's anything in the PPP protocol that would
control channel bonding.  But then, I haven't looked at the source,
either.  As far as I can tell, though, PPP just treats the IQ like a
very fast modem.  It works.

I wanted 2.3 because of the demand-dial features.  :)
