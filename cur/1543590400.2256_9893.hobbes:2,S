You want to yield as well otherwise you may just spin anyway

So use a timer
void tick_tick_boom(unsigned long l)
{
	struct my_device *d = (struct my_device *)l;
	if(its_still_busy(d))
	{
		d->timer_count--;
		if(d->timer_count)
		{
			/* Try again until timer_count hits zero */
			add_timer(&t->timer, jiffies+1);
			return;
		}
		else
		{
			/* Lose some .. */
			d->event_status = TIMEOUT;
		}
	}
	else
	{
		/* Win some .. */
		d->event_status = OK;
	}
	/* Wake up the invoker */
	wake_up(&d->timer_wait);
}
