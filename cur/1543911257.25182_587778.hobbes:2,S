But my firewall rules certainly do not log DNS packets, and if they
did, it would look very differently, no? I always prefix my iptables
LOG messages anyway.
This is a Xen client, if it makes a difference.
Now looking at it, it looks as if the log got garbled and 7.0.0.1:53
is really part of 127.0.0.1:53 (the machine does run a recursor).
Can stuff like this happen that data is lost in this way before
syslog can dump it?
