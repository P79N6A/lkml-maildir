Hello linux-kernel,
 wrote you about possibilities of using MMAP in performing I/O.
  So I decided to check if it really gives any benefit under Linux. I
  used stock system (IDE PIII-500, 768M RAM) and 2.4.19pre1aa1
  I've tested 2 file sizes - 200M and 2000M to see how the fact
  content fits to cache will affect the performance.  I used 1Kb
  blocks to have it the same as MYISAM uses for keycache.
  There were two tests. One is to read file convent sequentially and
  other was to random I/O  - read and write to random locations in
  1K sizes.  The reads/writes was it 50/50 proportion. The number of
  random IOs was 10000.  File system used was EXT3.
  Before each test the cache was brought to stable state by
  "cat test.dat > /dev/null"

  Rnd  read()    1m6.351s      1m46.149s     0m0.040s     0m0.400s
  Rnd  mmap()    1m10.707s     1m57.281s     0m0.280s     0m0.510s
    
  200M  32 byte block (to compare)
    Test         Time Best     Time Worst    User time    System time
  Seq. read()    0m8.076s      0m9.404s      0m1.730s     0m6.620s
  Seq  mmap()    0m1.227s      0m1.237s      0m1.140s     0m0.080s
  Rnd  read()    0m0.074s      0m0.085s      0m0.010s     0m0.070s
  Rnd  mmap()    0m0.029s      0m0.030s      0m0.010s     0m0.020s
  
  So I would say mmap is not really optimized nowdays in Linux and so
  read() may be wining in cases it should not. May be read-ahead is
  used with read and is not used with mmap.
  
  P.S if you're interested I can send you complete source
