It wasn't really a rename.  More that I ended up moving everything
useful the filp_open() did to other functions, so I didn't see the need
to keep around a stub like this:
 struct file *filp_open(const char *filename, int flags, int mode)
 {
	return open_namei(AT_FDCWD, filename, flags, mode);
 }
It would be trivial to add this stub back, though.
