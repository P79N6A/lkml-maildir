That's not necessarily true.  Externally useful header files go in include.  
Header files only used internally to the subsystem go in local directories.
The reason I put them under arch/i386 is because I didn't want the guts of the 
subarch splitup spilling into the kernel core.
While the subarch is local to i386, I think the headers should stay there.  If 
you want to make the subarch a global framework (and thus get agreement with 
Russel and ARM to use it) then putting them under the global include 
directories would probably make sense.
