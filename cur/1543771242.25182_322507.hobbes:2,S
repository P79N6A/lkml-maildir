Wild thought: how about doing this for the sibling ...
	rp->nr_running += SOME_BIG_NUMBER
when a SCHED_FIFO task starts running on some cpu, and
undo the above when the cpu is released.   This fools
the load balancer into _gradually_ moving tasks off the
sibling, when the cpu is hogged by some SCHED_FIFO task,
but should have little effect if a SCHED_FIFO task takes
little cpu time.
