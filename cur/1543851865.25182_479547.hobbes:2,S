But a:
  write(1, "..", 2);
does not have a trialing newline.
If some consumer of this kernel buffer copy of what the
user wrote cannot handle the possible trailing whitespace,
they will have to chomp (Perl phrase) it off.  You can't
just whack one byte blindly.
At least for the kernel/cpuset.c code, from whence this
came, the consumers of this kernel buffer copy are such
routines as simple_strtoul() and cpulist_parse(), both
of which cope with trailing newlines.
