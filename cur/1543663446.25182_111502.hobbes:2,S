impossible, either you submit page structures to the IP layer, or you
*must* have persistence, depending on a sock_sendmsg that can't schedule
would be totally broken (or the preemptive thing is a joke). nfs client
O_DIRET zerocopy would be a nice feature but this is 2.4.
the only option would be the atomic and at the same time persistent
kmaps in the process address space that don't work well with threads...
but again this is 2.4 and we miss it even in 2.5 because of the troubles
they generate.
