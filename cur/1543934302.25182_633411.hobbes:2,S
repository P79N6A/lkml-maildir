I thought Li-Ion batteries do not have memory effect. Actually I remember to 
have read recommendation to avoid deep discharges of Li-Ion battery, it was 
adviced to charge it as often as possible.

That is exactly the question - how do you compute 100%? As far as I can tell the 
only possibility is - when battery stops charging. At this point you have to 
assume battery is fully charged.
I tried to discharge battery (it was around 78%) and plug AC in again. It went 
on Charging until the same limit after that state changed to Full (well, in case 
of ACPI battery we really only can state - not (dis-)charging, there is no 
special Full state flag); kpowersave still believes battery is not fully 
charged. Main interface shows 84% (no Charging) - tooltip states it is being 
charged.

This would indicate that my battery lost 6% of capacity in new year, but 
question still remains - how should user tools properly calculate charge level?
