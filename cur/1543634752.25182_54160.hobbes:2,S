Greetings,
[remaining DMA-mapping conversion in drivers/net]
- tlan plays isa/pci and does as well some interesting things with copy
  buffers. The patch is attached but I'll feel safer if somebody with 
  the adequate hardware at hand appears.
- Imho rrunner wouldn't suffer from compat code removal + pci driver init 
  style + DMA mapping conversion. I'd like to know what the maintainer
  thinks before resurrecting the patch. Jes ?
