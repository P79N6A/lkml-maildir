y'know, this is such an important lock and people have had such problems
with it and so many different schemes and ideas have popped up that I'm
kinda thinking that we should wrap it:
	write_lock_mm(struct mm_struct *mm);
	write_unlock_mm(struct mm_struct *mm);
	read_lock_mm(struct mm_struct *mm);
	read_unlock_mm(struct mm_struct *mm);
so that further experimentations become easier?
