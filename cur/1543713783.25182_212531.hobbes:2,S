I will give this a try today and report back
I should also note, I tried using the older ee100pro driver and also had the same problems. I know it cannot be the network card as older 2.6 kernels did not exhibit this problem. If this is an ACPI change, what can we do to fix this? Currently, I let ACPI do the IRQ routing as I have various hardware that has issues with IRQs (ISA).
I haven't disabled ACPI as it was working fine before.
As a side note, I need to restart testing of the ACPI in general to see if it can route all my ISA devices properly using the new options added to kernel boot.
