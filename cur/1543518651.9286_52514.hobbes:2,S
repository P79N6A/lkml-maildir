Your BIOS might init it differently. I know that I used to have an Intel
motherboard-based machine at work about a year ago with this chip (or a
similar model) and did manage to get the SB Pro mode working too.
Basically I read the AC97 specs and found the specs on the register that
controls the SB Pro mode, then searched the PCI config space and found the
register (I was lucky; its boot config was identical to that listed in the
AC97 specs so I hit it on the first try). I flipped the necessary bit,
loaded the sb driver and voila.
