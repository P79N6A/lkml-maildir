I thought the change was a "quick hack" that would make stuff work
(page cache?) near the end of the file. That would mean that this kind
of "quick hack" won't work. 
But if it does anyway, then indeed 512 would be a more appropriate
choice.
I thought I had to convince people, so I chose a sitation that I hoped
people would understand to be likely/possible, to prevent reactions:
"No filesystem will use the last odd numbered 512bytes of a
partition".
