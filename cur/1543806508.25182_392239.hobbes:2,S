It'll be the well-known kgdb problem in your tree.  You might want to
make a note of this for future reference.
It's been a while since this came up, but I thought someone was working
on a kgdb version which didn't have this yucky side effect.  It's now
far too long ago for me to remember who it was.
What happened to getting that into -mm instead of this obviously buggy
version?
