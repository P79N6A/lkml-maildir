I (and MontaVista) will be expanding on the VST patches.  There are, currently, 
two levels of VST.  VST-I when entering the idle state (task) looks ahead in the 
timer list, finds the next event, and shuts down the "tick" until that time.  An 
interrupts resets things, be it from the end of the time counter or another source.
VST-II adds a call back list to idle entry and exit.  This allows one to add 
code to change (or even remove) timers on idle entry and restore them on exit.
We are doing this work to support deeply embedded applications that often times 
run on small batteries (think cell phone if you like).
