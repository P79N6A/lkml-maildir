To a quick glance here.
Everything looked OK except the board_list variable. The board_list variable
contains references to both __init and __exit and modpost has no way
to tell which one is good or bad. So to fix the warning this will generate
the only solution is to teach either modpost or the driver to ignore the
references.
The driver can be teached by renaming the variable to one of the following
patterns:
*driver, *_template, *_sht, *_ops, *_probe, *probe_one, *_console, *_timer
Or we could add *_board to modpost. The latter solutions I would like
to avoid.
