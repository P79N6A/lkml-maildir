[embedded platform!]
Over here, the 2.6.21.1 Kernel _builds_ fine with gcc-4.2.0 on an mpc8540 e500 powerpc
(mpc8540_ads_defconfig) but it just crashes silently on boot. But that's IMHO a
DeviceTree/U-Boot issue I haven't solved yet.
$ uname -a
Linux ecam.anagramm.de 2.6.21-rc5-g9a5ee4cc #4 Mon Apr 2 21:31:53 CEST 2007 ppc e500 GNU/Linux
ARCH=ppc compiled with GCC-4.1.2 works fine.
Greets,
