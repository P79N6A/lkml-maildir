Subject: 2.4.1-pre10 -> 2.4.1 klogd at 100% CPU ; 2.4.0 OK

   I've been trying different 2.4.1-pre kernels trying to find one
   that doesn't end up with klogd pegging the CPU. 2.4.0 is OK, but
   2.4.1-pre10 to 2.4.1 all leave klogd sitting at 100% CPU.
   The machine in question is a Gateway E-3200, a basic PIII-500
   running RH 7.0 with all the latest updates as well as the
   recommended updates documented in the Changes file. The kernel is
   compiled with kgcc (egcs-1.1.2).
I'm seeing exactly the same problem with 2.4.1 on a laptop (HP
OmniBook 6000, 700 MHz PIII) running Debian 2.2, patched to have
modutils 2.4.1 and linux-utils 2.10q.  The kernel was compiled with
gcc 2.95.2.  Again, 2.4.0 worked fine.
BTW, in my case, stopping and restarting klogd makes the problem go
away.  But every time I suspend/resume the machine, it comes back.
On the other hand, a desktop machine (ASUS P2B-LS, 600 MHz PIII)
running Debian woody and Linux 2.4.1 is _not_ having this problem.
