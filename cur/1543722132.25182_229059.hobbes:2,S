Dear Con,
I've been having odd problems with a USB device using your patchset (or
specifically, staircase). I applied the staircase7.1 patch as well. On
boot, an already plugged in device is not identified:
usb 2-2: new low speed USB device using address 3
usbhid: probe of 2-2:1.0 failed with error -5
Furthermore, a USB mouse is also on the bus, but it is identified fine.
Reinserting the other device still doesn't work:
usb 2-2: new low speed USB device using address 3
usbhid: probe of 2-2:1.0 failed with error -5
Adding 377516k swap on /dev/sda2.  Priority:-1 extents:1
XFS mounting filesystem hda1
Ending clean XFS mount for filesystem: hda1
usb 2-2: USB disconnect, address 3
usb 2-2: new low speed USB device using address 4
usbhid: probe of 2-2:1.0 failed with error -5
Everything works fine in 2.6.7:
usb 2-2: new low speed USB device using address 3
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: ctrl urb status -32 received
input: USB HID v1.00 Joystick [6666:0667] on usb-0000:00:10.0-2
At first I thought this was just a strict staircase problem, but I then
enabled usbfs and the joystick is attached fine with -ck1, so maybe it's
just a subtle timing issue?
Thought I would make the report and see if it uncovered anything, -ck runs
great. :)
