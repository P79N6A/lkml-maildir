Do you know that it absolutely does not exist?  Can it exist on any
PPC box?  If the answer to both those questions is no, I suggest
you don't probe for it in the first place.
You could enable DEBUG_AUTOCONF in 8250.c in 2.6.0-test3 and give
further probing information. 8)
Looking at PPC's pc_serial.h, it seems that you've told it to probe
there using ASYNC_BOOT_AUTOCONF | ASYNC_SKIP_TEST | ASYNC_AUTO_IRQ.
ASYNC_SKIP_TEST means that we use a reduced test to probe for a port -
we just check that we can read back a value written to 0x3e9.  If this
suceeds, we decide that there is a port present, and go on to try and
derive its type.
If you want to enable the more rigorous tests, remove ASYNC_SKIP_TEST
from the port flags.  This will make us check that the device behaves
like a UART before deciding that it is one.
