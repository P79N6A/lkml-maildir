Passing uids is only one way of solving the problem though. All the other
methods continue to apply. Uid passing lets you have centralised credential
services.
No more setuid login programs - login has to provide authentication to
the authentication server and then it will get a uid back if valid. 
Its also about 200 lines of code if that for the kernel
