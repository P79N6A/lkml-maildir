Hi all,
I'm seeing a somewhat curious problem on an Opteron-machine with 5G ram. 
   For outside reasons (driver development for our own cards) we have to 
set the vmalloc=256M parameter when booting the kernel. This causes the 
machine to panic due to missing a root filesystem right when the SCSI 
subsystem should have been initialized. I do not see any error messages, 
but do not have the full console log. Nothing noticeable on what is on 
the screen, at aleast.
On a working boot (ie not with vmalloc=256M specified), the system 
continues loading the MPT drivers;
....

On systems with <=4G ram, this does not occur. Also, just removing the 
vmalloc=256M (or changing it to =128M) parameter causes the system to 
continue booting.
I've tested this on the RH 2.6.9-11 kernel and also on the most recent 
kernel I could get to work (2.6.12.6 - there seems to be a problem with 
RHs mkinitrd for 2.6.13 and the MPT-drivers) with the same result.
Is this known? Anything I can do to assist with diagnosing or fixing this?
