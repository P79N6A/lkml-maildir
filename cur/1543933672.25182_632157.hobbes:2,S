Kernel 2.6.14 does not work any better than 2.6.23.x, and my F8 userspace environment rejects a
2.4.35 kernel. I will try a 2.6.0 kernel next, but have noticed tonight that a stock Fedora kernel
also hangs when it tries to load the orinoco_plx.ko kernel module. (This module also expect a
PLX9052 bridge.)
For reference, I have found a datasheet for the PLX9052 here:
http://www.dyneng.com/plx_9052.pdf
One theory could be that the PLX9052 chip requires an extra initialisation step for an Intel
SE440BX-2 motherboard (the board that hangs) vs an older Intel Zappa motherboard (where the chip
works OK). However, I don't know anything like enough about PCI to guess what such a step might
be.
Cheers,
Chris
