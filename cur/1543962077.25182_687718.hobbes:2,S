Would you mind using stgit? That you way have the queue patch
functionality, yet a simple git-push -f will send the whole
patch stack over to a repo (without the stgit bits that is),
leaving what looks like a regular tree with just lots of
recent commits. Does not even need extra scripts to do a
patchset->git conversion.

Indeed, assuming the remote is set up and you have a local branch,
`git reset --hard mm/master` after a fetch is the thing.
But be sure not to have any changed files.
