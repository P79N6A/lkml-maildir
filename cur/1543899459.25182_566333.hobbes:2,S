No it's not. It really allows only the _owner_ to change MTIME/ATIME.
And the thing is, other people _can_ change MTIME/ATIME, but only to the 
current time!
This is why ATTR_MTIME_SET ("set it to a _specific_ time") is so different 
from ATTR_MTIME ("set it to the _current_ time").
The former is for times() with times != NULL, and is strictly limited to 
only the owner (or root).
The latter is a "anybody who can change the inode can implicitly also 
change the inode timestamps, but only to the _current_ time".
In other words, the ATTR_A/MTIME_SET thing allows people to _lie_ about 
the time, and only the owner is allowed to do that. Which is why they are 
very different.
