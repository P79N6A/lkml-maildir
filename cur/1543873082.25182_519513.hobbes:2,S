Well, only when allocating it uses trylock, free uses normal lock.
glibc malloc will by default use the same arena for all threads, only when
it sees contention during allocation it gives different threads different
arenas.  So, e.g. if mysql did all allocations while holding some global
heap lock (thus glibc wouldn't see any contention on allocation), but
freeing would be done outside of application's critical section, you would
see contention on main arena's lock in the free path.
Calling malloc_stats (); from e.g. atexit handler could give interesting
details, especially if you recompile glibc malloc with -DTHREAD_STATS=1.
