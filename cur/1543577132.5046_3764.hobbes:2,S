Perhaps the help text for disk quotas needs to be updated, or at least the
howto for quotas.
The help text for disk quotas says to see the Quota mini-HOWTO.  The howto
says to get the quota source from:
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/subsystems/quota/all.tar.gz
That doesn't exist anymore.
I'm just looking for a quick pointer to the quota source, but also
suggesting that maybe the help text should be updated.  Or if someone
points me in the right direction, I'll write to the author of the howto.
