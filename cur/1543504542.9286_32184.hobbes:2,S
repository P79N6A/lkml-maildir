Not exactly. It just placed before files itself in directory and has
simple checksum of short filename inside. It's described in vfat.txt in
Documentation/filesystems directory.

I'm not sure if it'll be less ugly. It's not untypical for a lot of
programs to create a temporary file and then remove them. With your
symlink proposal just LFN will be deleted and file remains untouched.
The same is true for original hardlink's suggestions.
In short: ANY such scheme will solve some problems and introduce other
nasty problems.
P.S. And no, we can not just ignore short names/long names collisions and
create files with new file with LFN conflicting with short name or other
file. It'll work with Linux, but Windows9X/NT will be confused badly and
if you do not need Windows9X/NT interoperability then better to use ext2fs
or raiserfs anyway... The same goes against the idea of changing short
names when needed...
