Thanks a lot for the explanation.
Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to run new tests on the server
this week (always the big problem when it's a production machine).
I'm also going on a short vacation, so I won't have the oppotunity to
try and recreate a simpler test case at home for the next few days.
When I get back (in some 4 days time) I'll try to build a more simple
test case and in about a week or so I hopefully will get a new chance
to run new tests on the server that has so far shown the problem.
If there are additional tests you want me to run or data you want me
to collect, then let me know and I'll do so the first chance I get.
I'll be back in touch in ~1 weeks time.
