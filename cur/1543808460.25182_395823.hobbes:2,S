Yes but it is synchronous.

MS_INVALIDATE does that (in Linux), the spec is poorly worded but the
intention seems to be that it would push dirty state back into pagecache for
implementations such as ours.

linux@horizon.com has an application (database or logging I think), which
uses MS_SYNC to provide integrity guarantees, however it is possible to do
useful work between the last write to memory and the commit point. MS_ASYNC
is used to start the IO and pipeline work.

Currently MS_ASYNC does the same as MS_INVALIDATE. But it used to start
IO (before 2.5.something), and apparently it does in Solaris as well.

I didn't quite understand what you're saying here.

I think it is quite a bit different. Obviously what you're saying is crap,
but I think there are good arguments for changing MS_ASYNC so it is not
quite so obvious.
