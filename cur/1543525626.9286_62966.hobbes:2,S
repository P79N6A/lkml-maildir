I tried 2.3.44 last night, and found the following:
- rtl8139 is not found when compiled in, works as a module
- something is wrong with IDE (I suppose).
On a machine where 2.3.40+large_pid worked fine
(pid had seven digits :-), vanilla 2.3.44 fails:
Twice a kernel compile would stop after printing
	rm -f $tmppiggy ... $tmppiggy.lnk
and the machine (or at least the disk) was dead,
forcing an unclean reboot.
Once this was on the console and I could catch
	hdb: lost interrupt
[The first time this was on a busy machine, and the
result was a mess - inodes overwritten with the
binary files produced by the kernel compile - it kept
e2fsck busy for a while. The second time this was a very
quiet system, the only thing happening was the kernel
compile, and e2fsck didnt encounter problems.]
