The only other (just-posted) user is in mm/prio_tree.c (in the -mm
kernel), and it wants non-byte-mode output (pointers, 4 bytes or
8 bytes).  And it just doesn't make much sense to print only
2 pointers per line (when ASCII isn't being printed).
But maybe prio_tree.c::dump_vma() just isn't a good candidate
for lib/hexdump usage...
I need to look at other potential users/callers to see what the
needs are.
