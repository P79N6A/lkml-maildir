No, doing a range flush might be fine - we'd just do it _once_ per
invocation of swap_out(), and that would probably be fine.
The problem with the flush at the low level is that it's done once for
every page in the whole VM space, which is easily millions of times.
Cutting it down to once every MM would definitely be worth it.
It won't be "exact" either, but it would mean that at least the lifetime
of an optimistic TLB entry is bounded.
