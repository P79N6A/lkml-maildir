I agree with most of the changes (and I say "most" simply because I 
haven't reviewed all of them), but it would be better to coalesce these 
100+ patches into much smaller patch clumps.
"split your patches up" mantra can get taken too far.  We want -logical 
changes- separated out, and your patches are largely a single logical 
change (remove old code).
