OK. So now I tried with just 'Built-in Kernel Debugger support' and
it still worked (and look, no funny colors :) ). If I disable all
kernel debugging I get a general protection error at 00000000 (with
the IKD-patched 2.4.0t8 kernel).

It is an 'old' machine, approx. 5 years (an Olivetti M4, 82 modulo(?)).
Until two years ago it ran NT without problems. For the last two years
it has run win98 without problems. If you can suggest some way of 
testing the hw, I would happily try it, but for now this is what I
have to offer regarding hw stability.
As always, I appreciate suggestions and comments.
