Hi there,
Can `anybody' (Neil, Trond?) explain what the entries in
/var/lib/nfs/sm/ are for? If they refer to file locks, can we discover
which files they are referencing so I can try and understand why we get
leftover entries in there, and in which scenarios?
I"m still trying to look into the hang problems [1] I'm getting, since
there hasn't been a lot of progress about it. Anybody have a minute free
to try and help?
