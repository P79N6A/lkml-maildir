John,
I just pulled your latest changes from the wireless-2.6 repository. When I did so, I got the 
following git error:
finger@larrylap:~/wireless-2.6> git pull
Unpacking 22599 objects
  100% (22599/22599) done
error: no such remote ref refs/heads/zd1211rw
* refs/heads/origin: does not fast forward to branch 'master' of 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-2.6;
   not updating.
Is there any way for me to recover without pulling the entire tree again?
Thanks,
Larry
