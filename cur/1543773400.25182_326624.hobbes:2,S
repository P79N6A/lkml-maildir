Well there is no existing 'populated mapping' whatever that means.
I think the logic in the header is wrong.
The driver gets contiguous DMA RAM by telling the kernel that
there is less memory than there is. The driver finds out how
much RAM the kernel is using by using variable mum_physpages.
There is a long-time kernel bug that writes something beyond the
number of num_physpages, so the memory that the drivers use for
the first offset is (num_physpages * PAGE_SIZE) + PAGE_SIZE.
I therefore waste a page.
This address is the first location that is mapped using ioremap_nocache().
I map all the writable memory after this point up to some constant,
probably 500 megabytes. These pages will be subsequently mapped into
user-space when the user calls mmap().
Previous to 2.6.12, there was no problem memory-mapping and using
this data-area. Now there is some artificial constraint.
Cheers,
