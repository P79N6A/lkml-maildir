The kernel address space is 3Gb-4Gb (ie 1Gb sized) giving a 3Gb user
address space.

Well the CPU only has 4K/4Mb as the basic choices but you could map it
using 4Mb pages in theory - in practice its rather complicated because
of the VM handling. 2.6 has some basic stuff for doing this kind of
thing with fixed unswappable memory.
However if your radeon driver is touching the RAM often enough to matter
you have another problem.
