I have LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8. No LC_ALL or other locale variables set.
I run unicode_start on console and then menuconfig stops working right.
It prints ISO-8859-1 chars to UTF-8 terminal, which causes incorrect
indentation (UTF-8 has multi byte chars) and absence of frames.
I cannot get screenshot from console because I don't use framebuffer
and in xterm it works correctly (don't know why).
