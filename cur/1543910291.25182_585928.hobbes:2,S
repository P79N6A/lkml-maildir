The mention of /block/loop7/dev and the presence both XFS and ext3
function in the call stack suggested to me that you might have an ext3
filesystem in a loop device on XFS.  I see no other explanation for
that call stack other than a stack overflow, but then we're still back
at the same root cause.
Are you using device-mapper and/or md?  They too are known to blow 4k
stacks when used with XFS.

Please report how this works out.
