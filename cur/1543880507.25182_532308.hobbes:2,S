yeah, went with the default suggested by your patch:
   CONFIG_SUSPEND2_REPLACE_SWSUSP=y
and it was pretty easy to set things up. I used "echo disk > 
/sys/power/state" to trigger it.
In hindsight it was all pretty straightforward and suspend2 worked 
beautifully on an UP and on an SMP system i tried. So in exchange for 
suspend2 folks debugging a bug in CFS here's some suspend2 review 
feedback ;) Any plans about moving suspend2 to the upstream kernel? It 
should be pretty easy for it to co-exist with the current swsuspend 
code.
The patch has quite some size:
 89 files changed, 16452 insertions(+), 69 deletions(-)
that should obviously be split up into more than a dozen sub-patches, 
and fed to lkml with the small ones first. (unless it already is split 
up?)
i cannot comment on the kernel/power/ bits (they are way too large 
anyway), other than that they look pretty clean visually, but the 
lowlevel arch and generic kernel bits look sane in detail too, sans a 
few mostly trivial cleanliness issues:
+int suspend2_faulted = 0;
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(suspend2_faulted);
should be done via the pagefault notifier chain mechanism. Also, all the 
exports you added should be EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().
this:
-               ClearPageReserved(virt_to_page(addr));
-               init_page_count(virt_to_page(addr));
+               //ClearPageReserved(virt_to_page(addr));
+               //init_page_count(virt_to_page(addr));
looks like there's a buglet in there still somewhere?
+       if(PageHighMem(page))
+               return 0;
coding style.
+       BUG_ON( test_suspend_state(SUSPEND_RUNNING) &&  /* Suspend2, that is */
make this a WARN_ON() or a WARN_ON_ONCE() - that way you have a chance 
to even get feedback from users, instead of a 'uhm, X froze' report.
+#define FREEZER_OFF 0
+#define FREEZER_USERSPACE_FROZEN 1
+#define FREEZER_FULLY_ON 2
should be:
+#define FREEZER_OFF			0
+#define FREEZER_USERSPACE_FROZEN	1
+#define FREEZER_FULLY_ON		2
(you want your reviewers have an pleasant time reading your code :)
+#define NETLINK_SUSPEND2_USERUI        20      /* For suspend2's userui */
IIRC userui was at the center of suspend2 merge flames, right? So you 
might want to layer it ontop a less flashy suspend2-core and thus get 
90% of your patch upstream?
+++ linux/mm/vmscan.c
the MM impact looks quite nontrivial. But i suspect this is unavoidable, 
because you zap portions of the pagecache on the way to disk, so when it 
comes back it results in a different pagecache (new lru lists, etc.), 
right?
+++ linux/lib/dyn_pageflags.c
shouldnt this be in mm/dyn_pageflags.c? Plus it would be nice to use 
some other core kernel user for this infrastructure. (but it's not a 
necessity i guess)
but ... again, the patch looks sane all around.
