Hmm, I've only worked with a few platforms (i386, x86_64, ppc, mips, and
a little arm but I don't remember that much).  I believe that a memcpy
could work on all these platforms (error prone of course, but if the
memory is mapped its OK).  When entering a system call, the kernel still
has access to the memory locations assigned to the user.
It's been a while since I had to deal with the semantics of
copy_to/from_user.  So what platforms can not access a user space area
directly.  Is there a special assembly command to use to copy from user?
I haven't dealt (yet) with the copy_user of x86_64.  Is there a problem
when one tries to copy to/from a 32 bit address while in a 64 bit
address space?
Just curious, sorry for my ignorance here.
