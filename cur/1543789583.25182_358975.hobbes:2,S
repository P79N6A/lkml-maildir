Subject: [patch 2.6.14-rc4 3/3] Documentation: add sk98lin to the feature-removal-schedule
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/18/235

The sk98lin and skge drivers cover the same set of hardware, yet the
sk98lin driver is barely maintained.  This patch schedules sk98lin
for removal early next year.

+When:	April 2006
+Why:	This driver has been essentially unmaintained for some time.
+	Internally it is a mess, and the original authors are unwilling to
