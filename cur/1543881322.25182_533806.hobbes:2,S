This will change the API. Currently it is possible to do:
	cancel_delayed_work(dwork);
	schedule_delayed_work(dwork, delay);
and we have such a code. With the change you propose this can't work.

Look,
	void cancel_rearming_delayed_work(struct delayed_work *dwork)
	{
		struct work_struct *work = &dwork->work;
		struct cpu_workqueue_struct *cwq = get_wq_data(work);
		struct workqueue_struct *wq;
		const cpumask_t *cpu_map;
		int retry;
		int cpu;
		if (!cwq)
			return;
	retry:
		spin_lock_irq(&cwq->lock);
		list_del_init(&work->entry);
		__set_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING, work_data_bits(work));
		retry = try_to_del_timer_sync(&dwork->timer) < 0;
		spin_unlock_irq(&cwq->lock);
		if (unlikely(retry))
			goto retry;
		// the work can't be re-queued and the timer can't
		// be re-started due to WORK_STRUCT_PENDING
		wq = cwq->wq;
		cpu_map = wq_cpu_map(wq);
		for_each_cpu_mask(cpu, *cpu_map)
			wait_on_work(per_cpu_ptr(wq->cpu_wq, cpu), work);
		work_clear_pending(work);
	}
I think this almost works, except:
	- we should change run_workqueue() to call work_clear_pending()
	  under cwq->lock. I'd like to avoid this.
	- this is racy wrt cpu-hotplug. We should re-check get_wq_data()
	  when we take the lock. This is easy.
	- we should factor out the common code with cancel_work_sync().
I may be wrong, still had no time to concentrate on this with a "clear head".
May be tomorrow.

Why?

May be you are right, but still I don't think we should introduce
the new flag to implement this imho not-so-useful feature.
