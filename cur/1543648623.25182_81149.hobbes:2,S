I don't know whether you refer to this but the si_erno and si_code field
of the elf_siginfo structure are currently not used.  They are filled
with zero all the time.

One the 2.7 kernel development opens I hope *a lot* will change in the
core dump handling.  The current format isn't even adequate to represent
the currently represented information correctly (uid and gid are 16
bits) and there is other information which isn't even available.
I'm perfectly willing to consult anybody who wants to do some work in
this area.  Actually, the kernel side should be mostly simple, it "just"
means accessing and copying the right data.
