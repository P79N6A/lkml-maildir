   I had tried 6.1.8 + 2.4.3 and had problems which included messages like 
   'aic7xxx_abort returns 8194' and machine froze up shortly after X started.
   This on redhat 7.0. Sorry but since I was unable to even boot back the
   prev kernel (2.4.0) I cant provide any more detailed information. I have
   been following to see a few other folks have had some issues with scsi as well.
   I have 2 lvd scsi disks and one ide, AH 2940U2 - top of lilo included below -
   and bios boot order is scsi first.
   So I started again - installed redhat 7.0.9.
   took 2.4.4-pre1  and patched it with 
   linux-aic7xxx-6.1.10-2.4.3.patch
   Patch applied cleanly but when I compile it complains a little:
   In file included from aic7xxx_linux.c:131:
   aic7xxx_osm.h: In function `ahc_pci_read_config':
   aic7xxx_osm.h:862: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
   (for several .c files but always refers to 'ahc_pci_read_config')
   In file included from ... include/linux/raid/md.h:50,
   from init/main.c:24: ..include/linux/raid/md_k.h: In function `pers_to_level':
   raid/md_k.h:39: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
   Do I need to be concerned here?  I dont whether the presumed missing return is
   a bad thing or not. 
   I have not yet tried to boot this kernel.
   Also
