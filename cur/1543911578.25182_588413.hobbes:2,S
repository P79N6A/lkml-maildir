After applying Matthew Wilcox' patch to include/linux/isa.h this compiles
and boots on my Intel/openSUSE 10.2 test machine but throws out the
following messages I don't remember ever seeing with other kernels:
- on console early during boot, also in SuSE's /var/log/boot.msg:
your system time is not correct:
Wed Jul 13 13:15:31 UTC 1910
setting system time to:
Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 UTC 2007
- later, dto. on console and in /var/log/boot.msg:
FATAL: Error inserting processor (/lib/modules/2.6.23-rc3-mm1-testing/kernel/drivers/acpi/processor.ko): Input/output error
WARNING: Error inserting processor (/lib/modules/2.6.23-rc3-mm1-testing/kernel/drivers/acpi/processor.ko): Input/output error
FATAL: Error inserting thermal (/lib/modules/2.6.23-rc3-mm1-testing/kernel/drivers/acpi/thermal.ko): Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)
- apparently corresponding to that, in dmesg:
<4>[    7.691865] thermal: Unknown symbol acpi_processor_set_thermal_limit
- from fsck during boot:
/dev/system/root: Superblock last mount time is in the future.  FIXED.
/dev/system/root: Superblock last write time is in the future.  FIXED.
- in /var/log/warn:
Aug 25 00:44:00 xenon powersaved[5356]: WARNING (CpufreqManagement:51) No capability cpufreq_control
Aug 25 00:44:00 xenon powersaved[5356]: WARNING (CpufreqManagement:51) No capability cpufreq_control
And the SUSE startup sequence displays "failed" for the acpid daemon.
So it seems there is some strangeness wrt to system time and power
management. I don't have the time to bisect this right now, but
wanted to let you know anyway.
Apart from that, the kernel seems to work fine.
