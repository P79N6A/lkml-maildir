md will work just fine - although with much reduced performance - if
setup on top of partitions on the same disk. If all you have is a single
physical disk, you can create the loop devices accordingly. For
multipath testing, I have used LVM logical volumes + loop devices to
simulate such, or used UML and fed it with a bunch of block devices (LVs
or loop devices) from the host.
(The mp-test.sh script actually knows how to create arbitary numbers of
loop devices for multipath testing, which in turn uncovered a bug in our
loop handling, which axboe took care of...)
