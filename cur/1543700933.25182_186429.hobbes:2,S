Thanks, that fixes it for me. I too have been seeing terrible problems
with XMMS since the early 2.6 pre- kernels.
Because it only happens in XMMS I thought it was one of those
application bugs brought out by scheduler changes. I now use Zinf BTW
-It's better for large music collections (although not as stable or
flash).
I guess someone ought to revert the standard behaviour.
