That would certainly help, although one might quibble with the use of
the word "confinement" at all wrt AppArmor (it has a long-established
technical meaning that implies information flow control, and that goes
beyond even complete mediation - it requires global and persistent
protection of the data based on its properties, which requires stable
and unambiguous identifiers).
