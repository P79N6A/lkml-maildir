You're right, that is a silly scenario ;)  In fact if we mark vmas
with VM_DONTCOPY, then the child just crashes with a seg fault.
The type of thing I'm worried about is something like, for example:
a) app registers memory region with RDMA hardware -- in other words,
   loads the device's translation table for future I/O
b) app forks
c) app writes to the registered memory region, and the kernel breaks
   the COW for the (now read-only) page by mapping a new page
d) app starts an I/O that will do a DMA read from the region
e) device reads using the wrong, old mapping
This can be pretty insiduous because for example fork() + immediate
exec() or just using system() still leaves the parent with PTEs marked
read-only.  If an application does overlapping memory registrations so
get_user_pages() is called a lot, then as far as I can see
can_share_swap_page() will always return 0 and the COW will happen
even if the child process has thrown out its original vmas.
Or if the counts are in the correct range, then there's a small window
between fork() and exec() where the parent process can screw itself
up, so most of the time the app works, until it doesn't.
