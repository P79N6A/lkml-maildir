Yes, you can for example run BIOS initialization. In sandbox with x86
emulator ;-) It is much easier, and much safer, require for 2.5 that 
driver has to switch hardware to VGA mode on unload if hardware was 
in VGA mode before start, and if it is primary device in the box. 
For post-Millennium Matrox hardware, it is as simple as 
'outw(0x0003, 0x03DE);' (if you did not ask for disable VGA I/O & disable
VGA BIOS in matroxfb params. And if you asked... you probably know why 
better than driver).
