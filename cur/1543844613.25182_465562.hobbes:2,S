That came from named. It opens lots of sockets with SIOCGSTAMP.
No idea what it needs that many for.
I suspect  it was either dhcpd (server) or that ppp user space daemon
the original reporter was running.
Maybe it would be a good idea to add a printk by default?

This is actually quite fast. I've seen much worse ratios.
Also on some i386 kernels the pmtimer reads the register three 
times to work around some buggy implementation that doesn't latch the counter
properly.

If it's a reasonably new notebook it might be actually possible to change.
The default choices are quite conservative there because in the past
there were lots of problems with notebooks changing frequency behind
the kernel's back etc. and screwing up TSC. But that shouldn't happen anymore.
If you had a 64bit laptop the kernel would likely do the right choice :)
Notebooks are easy because they are only single socket, so the only thing
needed is to keep track of the frequency (or not if you have a Core+)
