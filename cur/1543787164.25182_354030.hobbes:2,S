In the top Makefile, CHECKFLAGS is defined as follows:
CHECKFLAGS     := -D__linux__ -Dlinux -D__STDC__ -Dunix -D__unix__ $(CF)
Can I use CF for user specific CHECKFLAGS ?
What do you think about we specify it manyally for a biendian target?
ex. m32r
  sparse check for biendian target
  $ make ARCH=m32r CF=-D__BIG_ENDIAN__=1 C=1   ... for big-endian
  $ make ARCH=m32r CF=-D__LITTLE__=1 C=1       ... for little-endian
  arch/m32r/Makefile:
  CHECKFLAGS += -D__m32r__

I understand what you said.
I think having -D__BIG_ENDIAN__ is one of the realistic solutions,
because it seems that there is no good solution about this problem
as other people said in this ML-thread.

IMHO, I think it is for convinience of building userland programs.
For example, in case of building programs (like Debian/GNU Linux
packages), it is useful that we can simply use a compiler without
not only modifying any source/Makefile but also specifing any 
target-specific options of the compiler.

I have no idea...

I think so, too.
I hope we can do check both of target endianness intentionally.
