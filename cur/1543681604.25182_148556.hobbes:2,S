	It's neither easier to do nor harder, it's basically the same code in
either place. However, doing it in kernel space saves the extra user/kernel
transition, poll set allocations, and copies across the u/k boundary in the
case where we do actually need to wait.

	The thing is, for some reason it (it being the cost of calling poll with a
constant timeout for 1,024 file descriptors) is exceptionally bad on Linux.
Worse than every other OS I've tested.

	Yep, so we invent new APIs to fix the deficiencies in the most common API's
implementation. Whatever.
