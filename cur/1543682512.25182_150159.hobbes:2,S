At least two P4 laptops are known to require the 2.5.74 patch, and
they do work with the local APIC.
While I don't dispute your machine has some problem, please
do the following first before we completely blacklist it:
- ensure you have the latest BIOS (ftp.asuscom.de has the ones for
  their desktop mainboards, presumably the laptop BIOSen are also there)
- in what way is ACPI mandatory? does it fail to boot, or does it
  just lose some specific feature? If you just want suspend support,
  try APM if the machine has it
A question for the ACPI people:
- Does the Linux kernel ACPI code ever transfer control to BIOS,
  explicitly or implicitly via SMIs triggered by the interpreter?
  If you do transfer control, do you disable interrupts and/or
  the interrupt controllers before transferring control?
  Entering BIOS with the local APIC live, in particular the timer,
  is a known hang-generator with APM.
