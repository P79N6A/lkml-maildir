Subject: [PATCH 0/20] inflate: refactor boot-time inflate code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/22/206

This is a refactored version of the lib/inflate.c:
- clean up some really ugly code
- clean up atrocities like '#include "../../../lib/inflate.c"'
- drop a ton of cut and paste code from the kernel boot
- move towards making the boot decompressor pluggable
- move towards unifying the multiple inflate implementations
- save space
Recent changes include:
- use proper pointer types for minimal malloc arena
- fix up static const usage to make ARM happy
- fix compile with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
This touches 11 architectures, which makes things slightly
interesting. Rather than break the patches out by arch, I've gone the
route of making a number of small incremental changes that sweep
across the tree. Patches that touch the per-arch code are marked
"(arch)".
I've been primarily testing this on x86, but various versions of this
code have gotten testing on a variety of architectures as part of my
linux-tiny tree.
