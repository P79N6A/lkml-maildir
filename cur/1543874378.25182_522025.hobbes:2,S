Subject: [PATCH] time : SMP friendly alignment of struct clocksource
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/20/68

struct clocksource is a critical data structure.
Most of its fields are read only, some of them are heavily modified at each timer interrupt.
It makes sense to separate those fields and make sure they all share one cache line, or at least the minimum for machines with small cache lines.
