The effect of the bug was that the timer generated twice as
many interrupts, making the kernel's wall-clock timer twice
as fast.
There were no OOPS issues related with that patch. Therefore,
your OOPS indicates dependencies on other changes in mpparse
and/or the ACPI code. Why hack a 2.4.26 kernel in this way?
Just put a 2.4.27 or 2.4.28-rc4 in there and be done with it :-)
