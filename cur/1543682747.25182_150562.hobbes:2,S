John:
Quick fix to the problem is remove devfs -- it appears that the devfs 
code doesn't like to have the raid layered on top of it, and it loses 
interrupts.
I've got two systems now running 4 200GB WD's connected to a single 
promise card (ATA100/TX2)  with the booting drive (a 5th drive) attached 
to the motherboard.  The raid works flawlessly and is fast -- I imagine 
there'd be a speedup by keeping all the drives as master (with 2 pdc's) 
and it would be more robust, but those aren't issues.
Hope this helps -- I'll post this to the mailing list to help anyone 
else with this problem.
