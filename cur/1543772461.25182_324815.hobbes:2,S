Actually, the real reason is for something like this:
#define myfunc1() {}
#define myfunc2() {}
if (a && b) myfunc1();
else        myfunc2();
This would be translated as:
if (a && b) {};
else        {};
Which would generate a syntax error:
zeus:~ kyle$ gcc -c `y -e .c` -o tmp.o <<'EOF'

/tmp/y.c8F08d.c:4: error: parse error before "else"
