Hi!
I get several
kernel: i8253 counting too high! resetting..
entries in syslog from kernel 2.4.22 upgraded from Debian woody (gcc
2.95.4) running on AMD K6II 450MHz with 64MB RAM. I don't have such
problem in kernel 2.4.20 upgraded from Slackware (gcc 2.95.3) running on
another box with the identical CPU and main board (but with 192MB RAM).
Does this message hurt anything?
Regards,
CN
