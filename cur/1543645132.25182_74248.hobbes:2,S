Well, the profile I posted was an interactive UP workload, and it's
fairly high there. Trimming cycles off this is good for everyone.
Small SMP boxen (dual?) used similarly will probably see additional
gains as the number of locked operations in fget() will be reduced.
There's clearly no contention or cacheline bouncing in my workloads as
none of them have tasks sharing file tables, nor is anything else
messing with the cachelines.
Cheers,
Bill
