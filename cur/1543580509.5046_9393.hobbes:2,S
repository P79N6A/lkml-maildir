It's written in the PCI config registers of the router. That's what I've
tried to document in the patch according to the chipset datasheet.
The BIOS in contrast uses link values, which are vendor-specific,
undocumented and sometimes wrong ;-)
But we have to rely on these unless we have the chipset docs to make it
better - hopefully.

Might be intresting _if_ you find something unexpected like new link
values. But I don't expect any surprise. You should end up with something
similar to Aaron - including the misleading mutual IDE/USB conflict
warning. But everythin fine.

APIC is a different approach to route IRQ's which is used on PII based
systems and newer (IIRC). So it doesn't matter in your case.
