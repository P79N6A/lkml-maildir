Object numbers  (kmem_bufctl_t) are unsigned, but some values have a 
special meaning:
"-1" is the magic value for end-of-list.
"-2" is the magic value for object in use.
All other values are valid object numbers. Right now object numbers are 
unsigned int, but initially I considered unsigned char or unsigned 
short. And then an explicit SLAB_LIMIT is necessary - with unsigned 
char, the limit would be 253 objects per slab, which could be reached if 
someone creates objects smaller than 16 bytes.
In Jerome's case, the debug checks noticed that the object-in-use 
sentinel was not in the bufctl entry during free, instead there was a 
"-1". There are several sources for the "-1": My initial guess was 
either a bug in slab, or a bad memory cell (only one bit difference). 
Thus I sent him a patch that changes multiple bits. Result: It remained 
a single bit change, i.e it's proven that slab doesn't write BUFCTL_END 
into the wrong slot.
