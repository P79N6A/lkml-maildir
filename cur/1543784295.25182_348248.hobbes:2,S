Link state can change anytime, not just at start-up.  That's why
it's being repeatedly monitored ;-)

That won't solve the reported issue, unfortunately.
Besides, how long would you like to wait for network connectivity
after plugging in the cable?  It is now lowered from [60-120] to
[0-60] seconds.
Personally, I'd prefer the delay to be < 10 seconds.
