Sure enough, but you need to keep in mind that x86 (and others) want to
use the generic support even for pages that don't have virtual addresses,
ie the page directories etc. So that argues for splitting up the existing
"tlb_remove_page()" into something like
	tlb_remove_tlb_entry(tlb_gather_t *tlb, struct page *page, unsigned long address)
	{
		tlb_flush_mapping(tlb, page, address);
		tlb->freed++;
		tlb_remove_page(tlb,page);
	}
	tlb_remove_page(tlb_gather_t *tlb, tlb)
	{
		.. add the page to the pages[] array ..
	}
where PPC would have the "tlb_flush_mapping()" thing, and something like
x86 or a regular TLB would just define it to be a no-op.
