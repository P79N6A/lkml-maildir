  Thanks Craig for your porting. I'll include your changes in last patch into
appropriate places in my patches, do some minor #ifdef changes in backward
compatible interface and put the patches (probably against 2.5.5) on ftp...
If there won't be objections I'll submit patches to Linus next week so you can
work on standard kernel...
