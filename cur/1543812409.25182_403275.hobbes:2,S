Well I reserve space for the device in my "BIOS".  However this is an  
embedded system so there isn't any calling out to the "BIOS" after  
linux has booted.  Is there some additional "work" that the x86  
systems do beyond ensure proper holes in the memory map exist for  
future devices to be placed into?

Ahh, looked at cpqphp_* and only found cpqhp_configure_device() of  
any use.  I'll take a look at cpcihp*.c

No problem, I asked because I'd prefer to use existing code to solve  
my problem.  Just need to understand how to get there.
