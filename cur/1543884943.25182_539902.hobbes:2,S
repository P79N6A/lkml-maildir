 that you are a zealot of OOP. I admit OOP is really a good idea and a
good abstraction. And that's the reason why we borrow it in. Of
course, OOP in C is not true OOP. (Maybe we can call it pseudo-OOP.)

well,I mean when use c as a higher level assembly maybe it a good
choose compare to assembly.
but,as below
http://www.research.att.com/~bs/esc99.html
when we use c to do the OOP ,for the c compiler has no the globe
Analysis .then the cache miss(for example : insert a array,c compiler
maybe  put the data into memory and then take it again for no globe
Analysis ) and the data not Optimi for in the register and c can't
control register like lisp or c++ with some compiler glob control and
Analysis,giveing c the penalty of 1/17 speed as normal
What's you think about it?
