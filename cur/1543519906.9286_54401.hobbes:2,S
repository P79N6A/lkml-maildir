Hello
I got these messeages today:
Dec 19 16:48:57 enterprise kernel: VM: Undead swap entry 00000300
VM: killing process communicator-sm               (
Dec 19 16:49:14 enterprise kernel: VM: killing process communicator-sm
Dec 19 16:49:50 enterprise kernel: Adding Swap: 56444k swap-space (priority 1)
After editing a web page with Nescape and using Gimp and xsane on my 32Meg
K6-350 i was with around 30meg in swap. I closed Gimp and xsane but 
the swap space remained full (i know because i keep a xmem on the taskbar).
So i did a swapoff -a and got that message. 
The system now seem to be ok:
enterprise:~$ uname -a
Linux enterprise 2.3.33 #10 Sat Dec 18 10:51:40 CET 1999 i586 unknown

Swap:        56444          0      56444
Let me know if you need other infos. 
Ciao. Marco.
