In 2038 there will still be 8bit 6502 embedded 
control systems leftover in dusty industrial and
commercial control systems.
People are talking about embedded linux systems now.
Some of those will still be around to greet the 22nd 
Century.
Once a small black box has been installed into a
building or factory, chances are it will remain there
until the building is torn down, the company goes bust
or changes its' activity so drastically that they 
rebuild themselves...
If you want a lesson in longevity, go visit a steel
mill. You'll find the latest gear side by side with
giant gear built in 1870 and pre-War (pick your own
favorite) relay control gear.
Home computers change, university computers change,
office computers change... but control gear stays
put until it croaks.
