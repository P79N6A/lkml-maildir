My apologies then... Actually, this is how Slackware-8.0 came (and
slackware-current AFAIK still comes). Apparently I must've missed
the transition, and so has Patrick Volkerding.
Also I'm sorry for bringing up the MODVERSIONS issue. If I had known
what flamewar it would trigger, I'd never have raised the topic. *sigh*
Now let's see what's to be found in glibc-2.2.5.tar.gz. :)
