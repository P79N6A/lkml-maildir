I'm rather sure it was around 2.5.59 but i couldn't swear about the exact time frame
as it might be a BK snapshot at the time.

Well with 2.6.57-mm3 + latest SVN checkout, it has about 1 such line per second 
in my logs as soon as i turn on my DV Camcorder.

I'll happily let someone else answer :)
Thanks,
