Correct. Seems to be broken since ages. I applied your patch to fix
the primary problem, but ...

So here we check for == _KERNPG_TABLE which includes the present bit as
well, so we mark it bad if its not present.

We return 0, when the present bit is 0, but the code which follows
does not check the present bit neither in mm/memory.c nor in
x86/mm/hugetlbpage.c. 
I think the correct solution is to not check the present bit in
pmd/pud_bad for both, but we need to check all the use cases in 32bit
thorougly.
