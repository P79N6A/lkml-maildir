I'd argue for rate limiting as the application only gets back new data,
never a cached value n times in a row.
With caching, you'd have to let the application know when the cached
value was last read and how long it will be cached for.  With rate
limiting, you'd just block the app and get the new data to the app
once the timer has expired.  Or, if the app doesn't read the data
until after the timer has expired, it will not block at all.
Seems to me that you'd have less redundant application processing with
rate limiting.
