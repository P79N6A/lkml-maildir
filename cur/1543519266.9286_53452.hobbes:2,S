We really should try to fix the anon shared mmap issue, it should be
possible these days reasonably easily (it's really mostly an issue of
making sure that we can allocate "swapper_inode" inodes on the fly, with
the one special swapper_inode remaining for regular paging).
I kind of agree with Richard that we don't really need to care all that
much about 2GB+ mappings, at least until people start really complaining.
At the same time I agree with Kanoj that this should just not be an issue
at all for new 64-bit architectures..
