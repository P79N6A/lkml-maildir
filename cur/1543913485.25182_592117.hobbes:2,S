All architectures except sparc64 are now done - please have a shot at doing
sparc64 as well.
I'd suggest that we not implement that cpu_sibling_map() macro and just
open-code the per_cpu() everywhere.  So henceforth any architecture which
implements CONFIG_SCHED_SMT must implement the per-cpu sibling map.
That's nice and simple, and avoids the unpleasant
pretend-function-used-as-an-lvalue trick.  (Well OK, per_cpu() does
that, but let's avoid resinning).
