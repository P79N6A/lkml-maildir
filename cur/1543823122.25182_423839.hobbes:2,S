As I said, I haven't started any development and wouldn't want to
proceed unless and until I am sure of not violating GPL. I am working on
a proprietary OS and I have a module which can talk to the OS through
remote mechanism. However, since the interface is susceptible to be used
by other OS as well, I wanted to make sure of it. I am not an expert in
Linux. And, that's the reason; I am seeking your opinion, so that I
don't falter at a later stage.
Regards,
Nutan

One more note.  The person that distributed the GPL code with your
module
may be the one in the "grey area". But then again, how can your module
be
a derived work if the author didn't even intend on having it work with
Linux?
