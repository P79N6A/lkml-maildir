While I have no problem with this, it would be a significant
behavior change (more so than changing the initial delay to 0).
IIRC, when the serial_core dead lock was being debugged
(by Russel King with some Dell guy who reported it 1-2 years ago) 
this change was suggested and rejected because some callers
are not running at IRQ context and want to use low_latency.
In the end, I think they decided to leave the correct use of
low_latency WRT running in IRQ context to the caller.
It might be safest to drop this portion so you can get the
obvious part of the patch accepted (consolidating
the redundant xxx_schedule_flip functions).
