Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Deadline iosched: Fix batching fairness
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/30/3

After switching data directions, deadline always starts the next batch
from the lowest-sector request.  This gives excessive deadline expiries
and large latency and throughput disparity between high- and low-sector
requests; an order of magnitude in some tests.
This patch changes the batching behaviour so new batches start from the
request whose expiry is earliest.
