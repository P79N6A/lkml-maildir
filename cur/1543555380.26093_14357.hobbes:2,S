Ah.  No, I don't think it would be polite to cause TTY hangup processing
to be deferred for this long.  I'd suggest that the policy be "scheduled
tasks can't sleep".  I guess kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) is acceptable because
the system is already running like a dog if this sleeps.

Some of these requirements could also be satisfied with a combination of
a timer_list and a tq_struct.  When the timer fires, feed the tq_struct
into schedule_task.
Easy, except for the problem of killing the damn things off reliably.  That
would require a bit of infrastructure.  But it's the right thing for
netdriver media polling functions, for example.
