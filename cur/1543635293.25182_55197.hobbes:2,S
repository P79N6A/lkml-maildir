That's a good point, but we have to start somewhere.  I think this is 
a reasonable way to start looking for bad behavior.  Since you have to 
fix all of them anyway, why not let the easy bunch come to you instead 
of seeking them out?  In a couple of kernel versions, I'd like to make 
it a BUG() to use the BKL in a nested fashion, or hold it during a 
schedule.  I think that his would be a reasonable thing to do during 
the early days of the first development series after we think we have 
this thing licked.  But, that is admittedly ages from now in kernel 
time.
The Stanford Checker or something resembling it would be invaluable 
here.  It would be a hell of a lot better than my litle patch!
