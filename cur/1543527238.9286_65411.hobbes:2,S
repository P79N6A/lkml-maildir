What config did you have to produce that ?
If you got this from selecting "Boot support (linear, striped)" then i
had a similar experience with 2.3.47.
I de-select this feature, and found that boot autodetction support
worked for raid0 without having to select this option.
Im not sure exactly why the option is there if it works anyway, i
understand raid is still being worked pretty hard, im sure it will work
itself out once the 0.90 raid code gets settled, in the mean time boot
support works for me.
