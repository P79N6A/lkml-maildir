OK, so I guess I can safely ommit this.

Is there any similiar functionality in a 2.4 kernel environment? A
pointer to a 2.4 kernel driver using such a mechanism would be a good
starter...

Yes, but unfortunately I have no chance to do this and therefore I rely
on others to do this. Well, the same applies to [me] and [kernel
drivers], but I hoped that it might be easier to try and backport one
driver instead of trying to improve other people's code (maybe that is
what OPC stands for :-)), especially when this code has a much larger
impact on several parts of the kernel.

OK, I will try to do so, but I am afraid that I will run out of time in
the meantime.
Thank you very much for your help and your fast response.
Kind regards,
