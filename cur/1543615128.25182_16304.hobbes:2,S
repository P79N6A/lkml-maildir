> 1. Shouldn't there be *four* zones: (DMA, low, high and PAE)?
Probably not. PAE isnt special. With PAE you pay the page table penalties
for all RAM.

Nope. The limit for directly mapped memory is 2^30.

Rarely. PCI vendors are not exactly angels when it comes to implementing all
32bits of a DMA transfer
