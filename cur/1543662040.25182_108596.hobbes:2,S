Indeed. Hardcoding map and multimap templates with string,string
parameter in the language sounds like a very worthless effort. If he
wants an high level syntax on top of the abstractions he should use a
more high level language. C can do everything but it's going to be a
sintax like what we do in the kernel, with lists, rbtrees, structures of
pointer to functions etc..

actually the python syntax for re is quite nice, and would be pretty
compatible with C, no magic perl =~ operator etc.. again a library like
STL in an highlevel language would do the trick just fine.
