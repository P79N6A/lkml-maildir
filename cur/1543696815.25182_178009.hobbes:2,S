Hmmm, Maybe I'm getting confused by all the winning-lottery messages,
but it's in the syscall specifications for connect() and
even fcntl(). http:/www.infran.ru/Techinfo/syscalls/syscalls_43.html
Also, maybe Linux now claims exclusive ownership and keeps it internal,
but some networking software, nfsd and pcnfsd, might not know about that.
I've seen ERESTARTSYS returned from a DOS (actually FAT) file-handle use
after a server has crashed and come back on-line.
Moot point, though, the reported errors were internal via syslog, which
was not previously known when I responded.
Cheers,
