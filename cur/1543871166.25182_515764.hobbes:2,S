Yep, I think it makes sense to use preallocation for defragmentation.
After all both preallocation and defragmentation shall call underlying 
filesystem multiple block allocator to try to allocate a chunk of 
contiguous blocks on disk. ext4 online defrag implementation by Takashi 
already support to choose a "goal" allocation block to guide the ext4 
block allocator to place the defraged file is a specific location.
Passing a little bit more hint to sys_fallocate() (i.e, goal block, 
and/or whether the goal block is important over the size of prealloc 
extent), might make it more useful for the orginial goal (get contigous 
and guranteed blocks) and for defragmentation.
