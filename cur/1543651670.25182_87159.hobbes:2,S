Well, one thing i to make certain you can actually do it with one or two  
system calls. Say, one system call to figure out how big a buffer is  
necessary (essentially, #tasks*size), then one read with a suitably-sized  
buffer. Then have a loop in the kernel that drops the lock as often as  
necessary, and otherwise puts it all in the buffer in one go. (If the  
#tasks grows too fast so it overruns the buffer even with some slack given  
in advance, tough, have a useful return code to indicate that and let ps  
retry.)
I briefly thought about mmap, but I don't think that actually buys  
anything.
