I think so too :)

That's what I ended up merging, elv_dispatch_sort() and it only takes q
and rq as parameters.

Yes, that was my question :-)

Well that's not quite my question, it is the opposite - why would you
not want to sort?

See the merged stuff, I think so. I just don't see any reason at all to
tie 'force' and 'sort' together.
