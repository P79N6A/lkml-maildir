I really like this idea.  I notice you didn't take the opportunity to
remove the ad hoc checking in ia64 acpi_parse_lsapic; probably that's
the next step.  Also, did you consider using max_entries==0 to signify
"unlimited"?  Zero seems like an otherwise useless value for max_entries
and would avoid having to choose an arbitrary limit.
