It may work, but the bridge secondary/subordinate numbers look wrong.
I am pondering if the bus numbering/bridging stuff shouldn't be given a
good looking-over.  I have the wonderful _PCI System Architecture, 4th
Ed._ in my hands, and it describes PCI-PCI bridge init in great detail,
including several multi-bus, multi-bridge examples.  (Martin, run don't
walk to amazon to get this book.)  Anyway, this book seems to imply that
we are getting stuff really wrong somewhere.
First, some definitions:
downstream - away from the host processor
primary - number of the PCI bus closer to the host processor
secondary - number of the PCI bus on the downstream side of the PCI
bridge
subordinate - number of the highest-numbered bus on the downstream side
of the PCI bridge
> 00:03.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1131 (rev 01)
>         Bus: primary=00, secondary=02, subordinate=05, sec-latency=0
First bridge on bus 0.
	primary == 0 - ok
	secondary == 2, should be 1 (bus #1 is behind this bridge)
	subordinate == 5, should be 2 (bus #2 follows us)
> 00:03.1 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1131 (rev 01)
>         Bus: primary=00, secondary=06, subordinate=09, sec-latency=0
Second bridge on bus 0.
	primary == 0 - ok
	secondary == 6, should be 2 (bus #2 behind this bridge)
	subordinate == 9, should be 3 (bus #3 follows us)
> 00:11.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82380FB (rev 01) (prog-if 80)
>         Bus: primary=00, secondary=01, subordinate=01, sec-latency=0
Third bridge on bus 0.
	primary == 0 - ok
	secondary == 1, should be 3 (bus #3 behind this bridge)
	subordinate == 1, should be 3 (no bus follows, so
subordinate==secondary)
Now... this final bridge, the PCI (not CardBus) bridge, actually looks
ok... if you imagine that the third bridge is configured before the
CardBus bridges for some reason.  Bus number 1 appears to be laid out
correctly.
However, the two CardBus bridges have totally wrong values for the
secondary and subordinate bridge numbers, whatever the cause.
Questions:
Martin, any idea why the bridges are numbered like this?
Second, will anything break if bus numbers change on x86?  There exists
pcibios_assign_all_busses() on all platforms... but only Alpha defines
it to 1.  All others define it to zero.
include/asm-alpha/pci.h:
	/* Override the logic in pci_scan_bus for skipping
	   already-configured bus numbers.  */
	#define pcibios_assign_all_busses()	1
And Jamal, can you privately e-mail me your 'dmesg' output (with
debugging enabled in pci-i386.h), from -before- applying patches.
Regards,
	Jeff
