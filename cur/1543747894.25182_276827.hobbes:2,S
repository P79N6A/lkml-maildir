  Hi,
  up to the actual kernel rc 2.6.10rc3 has broken pdc 20265 support. As
some kernel releases ago, one had to specify i/o ports on kernel
cmdline. 2.4.28 kernel works w/o cmdline parameter.
Is this behaviour intended? Will it be fixed in 2.6.10 release?
W/o parameter kernel (2.6) does not recognise the pdc ide controller
drives.
dmesg output states: "ideX: Wait for ready failed before probe !"
As of kernel rc 2.6.10rc1 the kernel even reported ide drive short
read and seek errors on drives even not connected to the pdc
controller but connected to the onboard controller (->/dev/hda1). In
fact /dev/hda1 has no errors (so far).
Any comments?
  Thanks.
    Nils
