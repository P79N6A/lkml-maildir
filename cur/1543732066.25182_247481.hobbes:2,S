It seems that the MMC block layer hasn't been assigned a major number. 
The code registers the block dev with a uninitialized variable. It then 
proceeds to create a mmc dir under devfs. Since I'm not using devfs this 
then poses a problem.
Some debug statements revealed that the driver ended up on major number 
254. I'm not familiar with how kernel memory is initialized but using an 
uninitialized variable should result in random numbers. It seems to get 
254 each time though. Can I count on this? (i.e. can I safely create 
device node files with this major).
