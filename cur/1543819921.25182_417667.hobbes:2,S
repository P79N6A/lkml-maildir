  I guess it is possible but certainly it's not that easy as just
changing b_blocknr. Each buffer head is attached to a page (either to a
page of a backing device mapping or to a page belonging to the inode
mapping). And if you look at e.g. __find_get_block_slow() you'll see
that we look for the buffer using that page. So you definitely need to
somehow attach the buffer to the new page at the correct location.
