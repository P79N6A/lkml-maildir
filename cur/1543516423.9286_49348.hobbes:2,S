   That's a little conflicting. On sparcs, a break signal on a serial
   console gets you to the PROM prompt (this is hardware handling).
It doesn't matter, since the sparc doesn't use my serial driver, since
it doesn't use 16550 compatible UART's (at least not for its serial
consoles).  Note BTW that there's no reason why the hardware console and
the software console for the OS have to be the same device.
