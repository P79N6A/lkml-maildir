Sorry, 2.2.5pre? to 2.2.11pre4, P233MMX, 2 Boomerang ethernet cards,
anything else needed?
Transmitting a ping from the machine in question through a FreeS/WAN
virtual device which in turn is attached to an ethernet device.
For now, I am using neigh_compat_output() in the place of what did use
dev_queue_xmit() in 2.0.xx kernels, where I have seen
skb->dst->output() used by several other drivers in the 2.2.xx
kernels since using skb->dst->output() will do bad things.
As a really dumb question, what does skb->dst->output() do?  What are
the uses of each of dev_queue_xmit(), neigh_compat_output(),
neigh_connected_output() and neigh_resolve_output()?
