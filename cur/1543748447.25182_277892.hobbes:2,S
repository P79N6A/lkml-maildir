I still do not know exactly how the count gets negative, but I tracked it
down to a user space app from emulex called HBAanywhere. The only thing I
can see this doing which might be related is attempting to open a lot of
non-existant /proc entries:
	/proc/scsi//120
	/proc/scsi//121
	etc...
Yes there is a // in there.
I ran with a BUG call if we manipulate nr_unused without the dcache lock
and it never tripped. All very wierd.
