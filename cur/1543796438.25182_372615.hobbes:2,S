I don't get the point where the advantage is when every distribution 
creates it's own stable branches.
AFAIR one of the reasons for the current 2.6 development model was to 
reduce the amount of feature patches distributions ship by offering an 
ftp.kernel.org kernel that gets new features early.
What's wrong with offering an unified branch with few regressions for 
both users and distributions? It's not that every distribution will use 
it, but as soon as one or two distributions are using it the amount of 
extra work for maintaining the branch should become pretty low.
