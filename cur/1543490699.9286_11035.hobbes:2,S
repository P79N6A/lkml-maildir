I have had this.  It is a bug in vmware, although I haven't worked
out what precisely causes it.  The solution is to put a CDROM in the
drive.  It locks up because Windows polls /dev/cdrom regularly and 
seems to die randomly if it can't do so.
Since I put a CDROM in the drive I have had NT workstation running in 
a window for over 24 hours without a hitch.
