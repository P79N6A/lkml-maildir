after some source reading I already comcluded that my judgement was a bit
hasty.

The system is using TCP/IP to mount most things. Besides that, some syslogging
is done and that's all.

Here's the result; the last column shows the number of log entries during a 15
minute run:
c0170898         t packet_rcv 13099
c0159a60             T ip_rcv 2399
c0168ba0            T arp_rcv 276
One strange thing I noticed is that the number of times the packet_rcv entry
occurs in a row is steadily increasing. Initially the log showed always two
packet_rcv entries in a row. This number increased continuously up to 10 in a
row when I stopped the test. Finally it looked like this:
[...]
May  7 13:42:21 foo kernel: c0159a60  
May  7 13:42:22 foo kernel: c0170898  
May  7 13:42:22 foo last message repeated 9 times 
May  7 13:42:22 foo kernel: c0159a60
