	Thank you for the pointer .  Fine you do not need to allow modules
	in order for a hacker to insert their code .  It is still another
	thing to allow modules & not put & use signatures on them .  AFAIK
	Linux doesn't have a method to load encrypted & signed modules at
	this time .  Please ,  someone prove me wrong .  I -personally-
	like statically compiled kernels .  The method being pushed forth
	at present doesn't allow that ,  Unless I am completely mistaken
	about what Alan & the rest have been discussing .  Again PLEASE
	someone prove me wrong about this also .

	I can beleive that 8-} .  Statically or written to readonly media
 	or the drive hard set to readonly ;-) .  I have followed most of
	Alan's suggestions security concerns over the years & a few that
	I thought of along the way .  Which later I found had been being
	done alot longer than I would have thought .  Tia ,  JimL
