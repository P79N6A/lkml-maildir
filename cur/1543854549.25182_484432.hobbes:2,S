Hey there,
Haven't seen any follow ups to this, so I'm going to ask stupid questions.  (I
only have 1G of RAM on my x86_64, so I'm no help.)
First off, have you pinged David Miller (davem at davemloft.net)? He seems to
have the DMA API tattooed on a body part, I think.

Confused. As in, once the bcm43xx module initcall happens? Or without bcm43xx
at all? If the former, is the behavior different when built as a module versus
built-in? (ie, are there ordering problems.)
