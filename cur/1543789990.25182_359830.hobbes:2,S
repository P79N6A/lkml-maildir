show me the "hcitool info ..." for the phone.

>From Linux to Linux you can get something around 80KB/sec. Do you have
any other USB dongle to test this against, because I think the PCMCIA
card is the problematic part here.
If you go over RFCOMM to the phone you will almost never reach the full
speed, because most RFCOMM implementation on the phones are not really
good. The PPP is eating the rest of the bandwidth.
