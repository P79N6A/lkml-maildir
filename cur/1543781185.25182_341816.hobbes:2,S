Not sure what you mean by "shutdown" - the OS shuts down the system 
cleanly or the BIOS just switches off the power? If the former, you, most 
probably, just have wrongly configured sensors. I had a problem with 
fictitious CPU overheating, until I modified my /etc/sensors.conf. Just 
ask on sensors@stimpy.netroedge.com - no need to subscribe, people are 
very helpful there.
