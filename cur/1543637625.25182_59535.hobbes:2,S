I suspect that the speaker twiddling portion of the code is 100 times
more important than the LED blinking part of it.  Everyone I know (as a
Radio Amateur) that knows Morse learned it by hearing it - seeing
blinking lights is a totally different part of the brain that needs to
learn how to interpret the input.
My gut feeling says that this patch falls into the "cool hack" category,
more than anything else - but the best part about cool hacks is that
they are occassionally really really useful to someone.
