I didn't study your patch in detail: as you say, more invasive,
but if it really does the job then it's an improvement, removing
some mystery from loop_thread().  And it does work fine for me -
well, I tested with your next little race addition, and Andrew's
on top of that (with lo->state typo fixed to lo->lo_state); but
I haven't tried your latest refinement from today.
Thanks,
Hugh
