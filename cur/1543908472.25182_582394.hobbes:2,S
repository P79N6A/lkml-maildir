KERN_INFO please, or KERN_WARNING at the highest, at least until such time
as enough drivers support enough hardware that it really *does* qualify for
"this should not fail" status.
(OK, so I'm just cranky because I'm tired of seeing a KERN_ERR thrown at every
reboot, just because the ata_piix driver doesn't know how to set this stuff up
for the DVD?RW drive in my laptop.  But when this goes upstream, lots of
*other* people are going to get hit by the exact same thing and think there's
something actually *wrong* with their hardware.)
