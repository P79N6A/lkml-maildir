yes. Note that for the many reasons i outlined before they are only 
"half false positives" - i.e. they are potentially dangerous constructs 
and they are potentially inefficient - hence we _want to_ document them 
in the code, to increase the cleanliness of the kernel. A pure "false 
positive" would be a totally valid and perfect locking construct being 
flagged by the lock validator.
nor do these warnings really hurt anyone. Lockdep prints info and then 
shuts up - the system continues to work.
