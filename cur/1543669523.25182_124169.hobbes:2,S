That made it work 8) thanks.
But there is something curious, with video=radeon:1024x768-8@60 I get:
renditai:~# fbset
mode "1024x768-60"
    # D: 65.003 MHz, H: 48.365 kHz, V: 60.006 Hz
    geometry 1024 768 1024 768 8
    timings 15384 168 8 29 3 144 6
    accel true
    rgba 8/0,8/0,8/0,0/0
endmode
But with fbset "1024x768-60" I get:
renditai:~# fbset
mode "1024x768-60"
    # D: 64.998 MHz, H: 48.362 kHz, V: 60.002 Hz
    geometry 1024 768 1024 768 8
    timings 15385 160 24 29 3 136 6
    accel true
    rgba 8/0,8/0,8/0,0/0
endmode
There's very little difference, but I was expecting to get the same
mode. I'll go read how that modedb stuff works...
Thanks again, bye.
