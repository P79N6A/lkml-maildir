I think so.
OTOH I'd be really surprised if anyone on the planet still used this
code/driver. IIRC and AFAICS it is (sdla.c coupled with dlci.c) the
first driver for the old Sangoma ISA sync serial cards (S502 - S508,
i.e. those based on Z80CPU doing HDLC and other things in firmware).
There was also a second(?) driver for those cards (official from
Sangoma), but:

    [WAN]: Remove broken and unmaintained Sangoma drivers.
    The in-kernel Sangoma drivers are both not compiling and marked as BROKEN
    since at least kernel 2.6.0.
    Sangoma offers out-of-tree drivers, and David Mandelstam told me Sangoma
    does no longer maintain the in-kernel drivers and prefers to provide them
    as a separate installation package.
    This patch therefore removes these drivers.
They claim support for "All S-Series Legacy Cards" with out-of-tree
drivers available from www.sangoma.com.
