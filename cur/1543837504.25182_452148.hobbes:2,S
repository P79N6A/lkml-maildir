>From a quick scan:
- The code is very poorly commented.  I'd want to spend a lot of time
  reviewing this implementation, but not in its present state.  
- Far, far too many inlines
- overly-terse variable naming
- There are several places which appear to be putting block numbers into
  an `int'.
- Needs kmalloc()->kzalloc() conversion
- replace all brelse() calls with put_bh().  Because brelse() is
  old-fashioned, has a weird name and neelessly permits a NULL arg.
  In fact it would be beter to convert JBD and ext3 to put_bh before
  copying it all over.
- The open-coded __clear_bit(BH_New, ...) in ext4_ext_get_blocks is a bit
  nasty.  We can live with nasty, but are we sure that it isn't buggy??
- It has about 7,000 instances of
	if ((lhs = expression)) {
  whereas the preferred coding style is
	lhs = expression;
	if (lhs) {
- The existing comments could benefit from some rework by a native English
  speaker.
