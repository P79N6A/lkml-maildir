Formally speaking, sizeof have forms
        sizeof(type), and
        sizeof expr
it is just that expression can usually be wrapped into parentheses, like
(((((0))))).

That's why we need more instances of sizeof expr in the kernel code, to
keep your knowledge of C afresh all the time. :-)
Note that Linux doesn't follow a custom of... some other kernels to
parenthesize everything to the heretical extent of writing 
   if ((a == 0) && (b == 1))
or
   return (foo);
