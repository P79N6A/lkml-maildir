> 2. use fls to calculate array position.
I'm not sure that's a good idea. I always had my doubts that power of twos
are a good size distribution. I remember the original slab paper from Bonwick
also discouraged them. With fls you would hard code it.
I think it would be better to keep the more flexible arbitary array so that
people can try to develop new better distributions.
