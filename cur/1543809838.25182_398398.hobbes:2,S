Joerg, it may not be perfect, but it does work. If you're still worried about 
how a few of the currently unmaintained devices still don't support SG_IO 
then I suggest you find someone to take maintainership.
I have neither the skill nor the want to do it or I would, just to see if it 
quieted you down any.
BTW, make it more than a couple of weeks for the patch I mentioned for libscg 
- I still need a response about my suggestion to use the BTL addresses Linux 
provides as the addresses passed around from libscg to cdrecord.
