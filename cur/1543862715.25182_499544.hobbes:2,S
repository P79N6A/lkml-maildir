I agree,... it seems drastic, but this is the only really secure solution.
But it seems that none of the responsible developers read our thread or
the bugreport and gave his opinion about the issue.

Well we can hope that Nvidia will find out more (though I'm not too
optimistic).

Yes I agree,.. this is a dangerous situation...
But we should not forget about the issue, just because SATA is not
longer affected.
