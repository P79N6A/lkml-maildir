My mind was clouded close to bedtime. I now remember the fix that
was published already at 2.6.17 time, from Steven Rostedt:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115124086410874&w=2
Well, result is that NO_HZ indeed is the culprit for this CPU
issue. /proc/interrupts showed the timer to be stuck on an initial 3044
triggers after boot, while NMI: counted up almost as fast as LOC: (if
that tells any tale). Observing "top -d 1" for awhile revealed SYS
bursting (almost regularly alternating) between 50% and 100% CPU each 2
to 3 seconds. In between it was 0. USER also had the same pattern, but
with much longer duration. Perhaps 10 seconds from one show to the next.
I've gotten the broken out hrt-dyntick1 patches so will be able to
experiment on my own - slowly, on spare time.
I am of course available for any thoughts or trials you can come up
with in the meantime.
