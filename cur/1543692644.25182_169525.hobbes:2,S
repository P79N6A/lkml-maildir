I would be glad to see megaraid 1.18k and megaraid2 2.00.9 be included
in 2.4.x-stock.  These seem stable in our testing thus far.  Alan has
had megaraid2 2.00.(something - 5?) in his tree for a while now.
Alan didn't want to lightswitch the 1.18X series driver out during a
stable kernel series, preferring to have both a megaraid and a megaraid2
driver, and let people decide.
> Are they in 2.6 already? 
2.6.x has megaraid 2.00.3 in it right now - it needs to be brought up to
2.00.9.  There's no reason to have both megaraid and megaraid2 in 2.6.x,
only one 'megaraid' which is 2.00.x.
Atul should be submitting changelogs and patches to James Bottomley and
linux-scsi for inclusion in both 2.4.x and 2.6.x, unless Marcelo asks to
receive them directly.
Thanks,
Matt
