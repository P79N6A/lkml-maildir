Welcome!
My colege Andrzej Sosnowski  in post "2.4.21 oops"
has write about error in kernel 2.4.21 in time of using this script
"#!/bin/sh
for IP in `/usr/bin/seq 3 500`; do
  ip addr add 3ffe:80ee:c1d::$IP/48 dev eth0
  ip addr add 3ffe:80ee:c1d::a:$IP/48 dev eth0
done"
I've made tests on clear kernel 2.4.21 in distributions:
debian 3.0r1 woody & Red Hat Linux release 8.0 (Psyche)
error kernel BUG sched.c 564! -  is showing while making this script.
At the latest version of kernel 2.4.20 this error does'nt exists.
I have been tested this kernel (2.4.21) also with patch 
grsecurity-1.9.10-2.4.21.patch.
It makes no difference - error shows again.
With best regards!
