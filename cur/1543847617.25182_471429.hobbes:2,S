Then add a cheesy printk into your driver then.  That's fine.

Because it's kind of been proven that not even then are things fixed up
(by personal experience with people naming drivers the same thing, which
will cause an WARN_ON() in the kernel to happen, yet is ignored by the
developer.)
But I don't mind adding it there too, if that helps.  But again, even
then, don't ignore the return value, it's trying to tell you something.
If you have multiple sysfs files, just use an attribute group which will
be be unwound automatically if something goes wrong.
