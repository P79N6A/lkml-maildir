It should be fixed now (I had patches from Nick, but got sidetracked by 
trying to fix metacity for the gnome people). 
I've pushed out, but mirroring delays mean that unless you use 
master.kernel.org you'll need to wait a bit. I think Nick cc'd the kernel 
mailing list, though, so you can look for subjects containing "mincore" if 
you need it fixed before that.
