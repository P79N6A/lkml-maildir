Hi,
    I've tried to port this to my kernel (2.6.12.6), but the kenel
fails to boot; it stops after Starting kernel ....
   I tried to add only the CFLAGS += -ffunction-sections to the
arch/arm/Makefile, and it still fails. my tool chains is "gcc version
3.4.4 (release) (CodeSourcery ARM 2005q3-2)"
any ideas?
