In 2.2 yes, but the 2.4 version of uni2char may return -1, as well as set
the output to ?. char2uni should perhaps also return a status code, but
that is unable to fail (at least for all charsets currently available).
I think my suggested changes to ncpfs tests for this, just like the old
code tests for errors, or?
