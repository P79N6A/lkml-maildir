I can certainly live with this.  The problem I had was just that the semantics 
were unexpected and undocumented.
I've talked to our kernel group about this and we agree that not invalidating 
the buffer cache makes a lot of sense, particularly if people use automounted 
block devices.

Historically it comes from Unixware which is used as the SysV4 reference 
platform.  I've asked our standards person to enquire but I think there won't 
be any documentation since issues that only impact clustering are seldom 
documented.
