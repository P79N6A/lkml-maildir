Even though I wasn't much help on this, it's nice to know what was different
on your config that was causing problems while I wasn't seeing any issues.
I sat here for almost an hour last night trying to figure out why your
machines memory map would different than mine (I have 320MB of RAM as well,
so they should have been the same).  The thought that you might be using a
different boot loader never even crossed my mind.  I've always used LILO so
that's why I didn't see any problems.
It's nice to know it wasn't just working for me by accident.
Later,
Tom
