hello,
  i've had problems compiling pcmcia support in the last 2 pre releases of
the test10 kernel, pre4 and pre5.  i'm using pcmcia-cs-3.1.21, which last
time i checked was the latest version of the pcmcia package source.

does anyone have a suggestion?  did something change in the configuration
that i missed?  though i monitor the linux-kernel list, i'm not
subscribed, please cc me in the reply.  thanks!
