There is a good ioctl, and kbdrate.c uses it, and some obscure people
have implementations in obscure places, but, as you remark correctly,
the standard kernel doesnt know about it.
You might implement KDKBDREP for all architectures and submit a patch.
Some other people did part of the work already, but they just mailed to
mailing lists and nothing came out of it. For example, see
