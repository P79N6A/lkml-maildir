One big problem with the Promise drivers is that they are not 64bit
clean. Trying them in a 64bit x86-64 kernel fails quickly.
Fixing them is unfortunately a lot of work because of the weird
Windows like programming style in the CAM layer in there.
Also at least some released versions of them had gapping security holes
in the ioctl handlers.
