  Subject: [PATCH] oprofile: Implement Intel architectural perfmon support
it is an absolutely horrible commit - which has caused the second 
regression in a row already. The _real_ "perfmon support" patch should 
have been a _oneliner_:
  -#define NUM_COUNTERS 2
  -#define NUM_CONTROLS 2
  +#define NUM_COUNTERS 8
  +#define NUM_CONTROLS 8
as Nehalem has 4 performance counters so 8 is plenty - and we dont expect 
more than 8 in the next 5 years or so.
It was absolutely unnecessary to add kmalloc to this rarely executed 
codepath - and the way it was added was absolutely horrible as well, it 
was tacked on in the middle of an existing codepath, instead of factoring 
it out nicely. Perfmon will eventually replace PMC management anyway, so 
there was no "this way it's cleaner" argument either. So this code should 
have been changed minimally, instead of slapping in a full kmalloc for a 
simple array extension from 2 to 4 entries ...
You need to be more careful when changing x86 architecture code.
