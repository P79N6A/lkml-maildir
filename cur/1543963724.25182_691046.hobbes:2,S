   Yes but it should've probably also supported DMA via Au1100 DMA 
controller (not DBDMA).

   I assume just parametrizing the board-level functions using the data 
about BCSR (like it was done in the driver before) just won't work?

   Why? I think it's smarter than register SoC devices in every instance of 
board setup code. This way, the board setup code has already programmed 
sys_pinfunc as it sees fit, and the common code accomodates to this need 
registering those devices that the coard code have selected.
