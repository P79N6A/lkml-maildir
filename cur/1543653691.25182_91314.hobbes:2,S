Yes.  When a drive is added to an array it gets a number which it
keeps for it's life in the array.  This is completely separate from
the number that says what it's role in the array is.  This number,
together with the set_uuid, forms the 'name' of the device as long as
it is part of the array.  So there could well be holes in the
numbering of devices, but in general the set of numbers would be
fairly dense (max number of holes is max number of hot-spaces that you
have had in the array at any one time).

Thanks.  I think I did check that once, but then I changed things
again :-(
Actually, making utime a u64 makes this properly aligned again, but I
will group the u64s together at the top.

Another possibility that I considered was a size in chunks, but
sectors is less confusing.

Well, actually it is user-space which dynamically assigns a minor.
It then has the option of recording, possibly as a symlink in /dev, the
relationship between the 'name' of the array and the dynamically
assigned minor.

... except to show that is is sufficient to meet the needs of users.
