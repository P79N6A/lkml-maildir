To pay for itself it would have to cost multiple millions of dollars.  The
#1 constraint in an IDE drive is cost per gigabyte, since 99.9% of
purchasers don't look at anything else.  This means that we strip down
things like our electronics and internal mask ROMs to their minimum required
size.  Specialized code with extra features would inherently be larger,
which gives two choices:
1. burdon 60 million drives per year with the capability to run this
software
2. 1-off or 2-off or whatever for the few times a year that you get asked
for this
#1 is prohibitive from a cost perspective since the demand simply isn't that
high.  #2 is prohibitive because of the engineering and manufacturing
resources required to build a special product.
Plus, all data recovery would be on drives already sold...  Since every
drive optimizes itself as part of the manufacturing process to the exact
capabilities of the channel ASIC, heads they were manufactured with, etc,
the only way for these new recovery tools to work reliably would be to use
option #1 above, which I've already said isn't worth the cost.  I hear about
people swapping PCBs on disk drives to recover data when one fries... yes
this can work to some degree, but I absolutely wouldn't trust anything
written in a swapped-board setup.
The community of knowledgable users who could use such features and would be
willing to pay, say, $20 extra for the cost, is nothing next to the number
of users who go to Dell's website and say "this drive is 20GB more for $10
less, lets get this one!"

Writes are destructive, and very often "fix" the problem on the media.  If
the write succeeds, and can be read by the disk, there's no point in
remapping.  It is only when you're unable to write to a specific area that
remap-on-write makes any sense.
We keep track of where we have trouble reading or writing, and use that to
reassign based on various criteria automatically.
Best data to use, I'd guess, for "predicting" failures, is the blown rev
counter in smart.  If you're blowing revs, you're having trouble getting the
data you want off or onto the drive.
