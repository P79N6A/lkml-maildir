Jeff, please read this one - I have a number of important things in it. Also, 
I'd like comments from everyone else interested.
I can understand you, so I'll try to reduce my mails to you to increase the 
signal/noise ratio.
I'll still send what needed to the list, but CC you just when requesting your 
attention (not for trivial fixlet, yes for things as this one, which smelt 
like being an hack done on purpose).

You mean it failing with EINTR, right?

Also, why shouldn't sigprocmask be restartable with the -ERESTART* mechanism? 
Wouldn't your kludge break?
Also, a nicer way to code this could be to have an explicit sighandler setting 
a flag (to get the syscall interrupted if the signal arrives before being 
blocked) and to call sigpending() (to test if the signal arrived just after 
setting it). After the syscall, that could become SIG_IGN.
Also, (optional answer), why is this needed? A comment about such issues would 
be better than an answer email.

Ok. However, I have a general question about all this whole code: why do you 
use pipes as synchronization primitives? Did you avoid semaphores for 
portability issues, or for persistency ones? Both can be solved (with the os_ 
layer and the IPC_PRIVATE key).
This would especially help during context switching, I think. I have just a 
rough idea of what switch_pipe is for, but calling the network layer (what 
you call os_pipe() is actually socketpair(), which is very confusing) to rely 
on the semaphores / wait queues it uses seems suboptimal and ugly.
What are your ideas about this?
