My actual setup (2.4.10-ac12) is:
#
# Networking options
#
CONFIG_PACKET=y
# CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP is not set
CONFIG_NETLINK=y
CONFIG_RTNETLINK=y
# CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV is not set
# CONFIG_NETFILTER is not set
CONFIG_FILTER=y
CONFIG_UNIX=y
CONFIG_INET=y
But the origin of the question wast that 'pump' DHCP client stopped working.
No I have switched to dhcp-client-3.0-1mdk.
Anybody has pump working with newer kernels ?
