a very good question: stephen smalley described an approach in which
exactly what you suggest can be done.
please bear with me whilst i explain, then i will answer.
the issue is that FireFlier is an on-demand (user-driven) popup firewall
program [and there literally ISN'T any firewall program available for
linux that even remotely comes close to the same capabilities as
fireflier]
so rules are queued (ipt_queue) and the popup thrown at the user until
they select "yes, no, create-a-firewall-rule".
to parallel the same functionality i would need to place a hook in
selinux to catch an audit operation (hooks are already there), then
alert the user to it, then create a rule, recompile the policy, and
_then_ let the hook proceed.
i'm not sure if this would work!!!
so, i didn't want to use selinux contexts because  it involves
dynamically creating selinux policy rules.
fireflier is NOT a "create-it-once-then-apply-it-suck-it-and-see"
firewall program.
it's an on-demand "popup" firewall program where the default is
"block by virtue of the packet being in the ip_queue, awaiting
 user approval or disapproval".
unless... *shudder* ... you mean ... why didn't i consider getting
FireFlier to _create_ selinux contexts, blatting them into the policy
directly? (which i know is possible, there do exist binary policy
editing-and-writing tools).
well... if this approach turns out to be a total nightmare, then
your question is really appreciated because it makes me think of
other possibilities.
