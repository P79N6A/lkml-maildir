One of the major benefits from git is that whenever I decide to
do some changes git allows me to start modifying as I like and when
done I just do "git diff | less" to review it. And when it turns out to be a piece of crap I just do "git reset --hard" and be done with it.
This make my life so much easier than having to copy symlinked tress
around all the time - and I then may not touch the base for the symlinks.
Put all other nice and usefull features aside this has been a major
timesaver for me both in the bk days and also now in the git days.
And quilt does not help me in this respect as I understood last I looked.
Using git sometimes does not work out that well for this.
But then I do a simple git format-patch HEAD~nn..HEAD which I apply on top
of a freshly cloned tree and we are back on track. This tricks works for me
since I have only two customers of my kbuild.git tree - akpm and Linus.
Where Linus just pulls into his tree so no problem, and Andrew seems to cope
fine with me doing a fresh tree now and then.
