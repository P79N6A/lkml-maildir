Right you are. That was a total brain fart on my part, I apologize.

Luckily the platform isn't broken. It's just that sdhci driver
doesn't have this bug, I was a bit confused by two these drivers
instead.
Here is the original patch that has this bug:
http://www.bitshrine.org/gpp/kernel-2.6.25-MPC837xE-RDB-add-esdhc-support.patch
Notice that esdhc_tasklet_card() grabs spin_lock(), not
spin_lock_irqsave() as sdhci driver. I fixed this in the esdhc patch
that I sent, but then I decided to "fix" irq handler too, which
wasn't necessary, of course. And that's it.
Thanks,
