I did. If I patch the kernel, my compiling procedure is always as follows:
==================
make clean
make mrproper
make menuconfig
make dep
make modules
make bzlilo
make modules_install
shutdown -r now
==================
The module loads fine. In /var/log/messages there are reports of
detecting AGP 3.5 compatible hardware, but as I said, X just won't start
properly and will report AGP 4X mode.
I checked /proc/driver/nvidia, and it reports AGP 8X hardware and
everything.
I was thinking, I have not tested the nvidia kernel module with the 2.5
kernel. There is an unofficial patch for getting it to compile. I might
give it a try to see if it works, but that won't happen soon.
If anyone wants to give it a try, visit:
