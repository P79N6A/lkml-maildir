The only reason I didn't do that is that there is already an
asm/page.h.  But, linux/page.h would be a fine name, too.

The only tricky part might be page-flags.h includes asm/pgtable.h, which
(on i386) includes linux/slab.h, which includes asm/page.h.  This might
somewhat restrict the number of places that the new header can be
included.  As it stands, it can be included (and get you a full
definition of struct page) almost anywhere.
But, I'm not quite sure why page-flags.h even needs asm/pgtable.h.  I
just took it out in i386, and it still compiles just fine.  Maybe it is
needed for another architecture.
