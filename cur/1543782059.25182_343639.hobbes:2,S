It looks to be feasible to implement this locklessly the same way as the
radix-tree does (with a per_cpu list), except that you still need a
start/end API for the pre allocation to do the initial disable of pre-
emption.
Then the remove should simply then free the entry (again like radix-
tree) and let the slab take care of necessary locking.
Of course, if we're going to go to all this trouble, the next question
that arises naturally is why not just reuse the radix-tree code to
implement idr anyway ... ?
