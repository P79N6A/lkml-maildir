Hello,
I'd just like to have the coordinates of the maintainer of
linux/arch/x86_64/processor.h
I'd have a need to sneak up on the stack pointer of various process on a
amd64 architecture and  the KSTK_ESP macro for x86_64 still returns -1
Please CC: me in replies as I don't actively subscribe to the list.
