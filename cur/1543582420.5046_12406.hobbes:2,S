Hello, Pete!
I understand that you tried to implement the native synthesizer for YMF
PCI cards. Thank you for your efforts!
Unfortunately, it doesn't work for me. Linux 2.4.1-ac18 is compiled with
CONFIG_SOUND_YMFPCI=m and CONFIG_SOUND_YMFPCI_LEGACY=y.
When I load ymfpci, the kernel messages are:
ymfpci: YMF740C at 0xf4000000 IRQ 10
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x4144:0x5303 (Analog Devices AD1819)
I'm using devfs, so I can see what files appear in /dev/sound.
# ls -l /dev/sound/
total 0
crw-rw----    1 root     users     14,   4 Dec 31  1969 audio
crw-rw----    1 root     users     14,   3 Dec 31  1969 dsp
crw-rw----    1 root     users     14,   5 Dec 31  1969 dspW
crw-rw----    1 root     users     14,   0 Dec 31  1969 mixer
crw-rw----    1 root     users     14,   1 Dec 31  1969 sequencer
crw-rw----    1 root     users     14,   8 Dec 31  1969 sequencer2
However, I cannot use sequencer or sequencer2:
[proski@fonzie media]$ cat ode2joy.mid >/dev/sound/sequencer
bash: /dev/sound/sequencer: No such device or address
[proski@fonzie media]$ cat ode2joy.mid >/dev/sound/sequencer2
bash: /dev/sound/sequencer2: No such device or address
"No such device or address" is ENXIO. I added debug printk's near
all ENXIO in ymfpci.c, but neither of them has triggered.
If I load opl3, /dev/sound/sequencer becomes useful - cat doesn't exit and
dmesg shows:
/dev/music: Obsolete (4 byte) API was used by cat
Regards,
Pavel Roskin
