Yes. As already discussed with Pavel, it is one option to use the format
string of the message as message ID. The disadvantage compared to
message IDs like hashes is, that format strings might be even less
unique than hashes and it's probably less convenient for searching by
operators.
An operator has to issue either:
>> info lp.4711
or
>> info "lp0: on fire"
