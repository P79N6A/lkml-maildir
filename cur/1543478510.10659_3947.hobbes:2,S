If we combine it with early scanning of the page tables,  it should allow us
to perform I/O before we need the memory.  While not bogging down processes.

This is only because he didn't implement any kind of request queue.
A fifo queue of pages to write would have keep performance up at current levels.

Nope.  Because we can still have some try to write to file X.
That write needs memory, and we try to swapout a mapping of file X.
Unless you believe it implies the write outs then must use a seperate process.

With a reasonable proximity in time even that isn't necessary because of the buffer
cache.  This is only a real issue for filesystems that don't implement good
write cachine on their own.  In which case the primary thing to fix is
caching for those filesystems.  We can use PG_dirty for that case too, but
the emphasis is different.

At least in part because for NFS you need who is doing the write, which
we currently store with a struct file.  To get it correct we really
need a two level setup.  Level 1 per pte to enter in the write request.
Level 2 per page to acutally write it out.
If there are conflicts, (not the same user, etc) Level 1 can handle them.
If I have any luck I should have a draft of a complete set of changes to do
all of this for 2.3 in about a month.  I have been working on this in the
backgroud for quite a while.
