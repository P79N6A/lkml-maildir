I have found that sound card "hick-ups" while doing heavy work under Linux
are an indication of an IRQ problem.  I had that problem on my P-III 650
until I went in and rearranged cards and sorted out what was on what IRQ.
(The BIOS just picked numbers, it gave you no way to determine order or
slots.  What IRQ you got depended on the slot and there was no real way
to chenge it.) 
Some boards have a very poor way of chosing the assignment
of IRQs. You just have to shuffle things until you get what you want. 
Since I did the manual reorg of the hardware, things have run MUCH
smoother.
