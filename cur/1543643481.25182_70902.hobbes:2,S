You're all talk and no action.
The last time I looked, the people who really _do_ improve the quality of
the kernel don't tend to care too much about debuggers, or are at least
capable to add a patch on their own.
In fact, of the people who opened their mouth about the BUG() issue, how 
many actually ended up personally _debugging_ the BUG() that we were 
talking about?
I did. Matt probably did. But I didn't see you fixing it with your
debugger.
So next time you bring up the kernel debugger issue, show some code and 
real improvement first. Until then, don't spout off.
