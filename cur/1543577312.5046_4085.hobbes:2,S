I just tried to patch ext3fs 0.0.5d on top of a 2.2.18 that already had
reiserfs 3.5.28 and failed, there are overlapping patches in fs/buffer.c
that I cannot resolve for lack of knowledge how buffer.c and journalling
are supposed to fit together.
I reported ext3fs and reiserfs incompatibilities quite some time ago.
