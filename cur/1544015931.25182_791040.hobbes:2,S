Why?  On almost all large machines I've seen or heard of, memory size
scales way better than the number of cpus.  Whether certain usage
makes sense or not surely is debatable but I can't imagine all use
cases where 2MB percpu TLB entry could be useful would be senseless.

I don't think moving live objects is such a good idea for the
following reasons.
1. Programming convenience is usually much more important than people
   think it is.  Even in the kernel.  I think it's very likely that
   we'll have unending stream of small feature requirements which
   would step just outside the supported bounds and ever smart
   workaround until the restriction is finally removed years later.
2. Moving live objects is inherently dangerous + it won't happen
   often.  Thinking about possible subtle bugs is scary.
Thanks.
