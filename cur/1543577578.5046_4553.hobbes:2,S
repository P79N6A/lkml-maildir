I'm wondering why building those drivers are options at all on sparc64
since none of the sparc64 machines (that I know of) currently available
have anything other than the cs4231 or no audio support.
Basically, those two should be removed from the config options for
sparc64... and in the meantime, you should build without 'em. :)
