Then either the patch author splits out the bug if they want to, or we
punt and say "wait for 2.6.12".  Distros can then decide if they want to
take the whole $big_patch in their releases, if they are near a release
cycle.
I feel that imposing such limits is the only way this can be done and
remain sane.
