Subject: [Patch][2.4] Oops if limit of memory via 'mem=123' failed.

Hello,
the following patch would have saved me some time in wondering about the
'mem=XXX' kernel-parameter (more specific that initrd failed if mem=XXX is
greater than the available physical memory size).
Please apply if you think it would be helpful to other.
 Peter
