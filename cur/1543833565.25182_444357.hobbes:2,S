Currently this is a security module policy, so it gets weird.

My gut feel is that we put a cap_suid in struct user, and the
setup some kind of user interface to it.  And then just
have the above routine copy cap_suid from the struct user
and not special case uid == 0.
But only the root user would by default have any caps in his
struct user.

I agree that setting the fs_user_namespace at mount time is fine.
However when we use a mount that a process in another user namespace
we need to not assume the uids are the same.
Do you see the difference?

Yes.

If we could have [RFC] in front of these proof of concept patches
it would clear up a lot of confusion.

Actually I was thinking something as mundane as a mapping table.  This
uid in this namespace equals that uid in that other namespace.
