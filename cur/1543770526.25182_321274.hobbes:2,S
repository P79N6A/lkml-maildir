Does the thing work correctly under any versions of Linux?  If so, which?
It appears that you entered cdrom_pc_intr() with IDE_IREASON_REG = 0x01.
 * ATAPI Interrupt Reason Register.
 *
 * cod          : Information transferred is command (1) or data (0)
 * io           : The device requests us to read (1) or write (0)
io = 0
cod = 1
I'm not sure what this means.  It generated an interrupt, expecting the
kernel to send a write command?  That sounds odd.
If the answer to my first queston is "no" then perhaps the hardware is
busted.  Try swapping out cables, check power supplies, try a different
drive, etc.
If none of that helps then perhaps there's something we can do in
cdrom_pc_intr() to work around this?
(Should cdrom_pc_intr() be using atapi_ireason_t?)
