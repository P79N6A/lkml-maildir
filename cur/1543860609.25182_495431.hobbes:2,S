Well, on powerpc, we've always had it binary. We expose the files with
the exact binary content of the properties. We then use paulus' "lsprop"
tool which is installed by default on pretty much all ppc distros, which
duplicates OF's heuristics to display property contents (as strings, hex
values or mix of both depending on that they contain).
It has proved a good idea in general as I can easily get an exact
device-tree dump from users by asking for a tarball of /proc/device-tree
and in some case, the data in there -is- binary (For example, the EDID
properties for monitors left by video drivers, or things like that).
Ben.
