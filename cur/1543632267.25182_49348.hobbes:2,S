First cut seems like a good start...
Comments:
* use standard CML indentation
* use CONFIG_X86_ as the prefix for all config symbols you're creating
* Alan's comment seems fair, and also gives me a tangential idea: I 
wonder if making the CPU features selectable is useful? i.e. provide an 
actual config option for MMX memcpy, F00F bug, WP, etc. Normal (current) 
logic is to look at the cpu selected, and deduce these options.
