Subject: BAD: reproducible lockup with SCSI + SOUND on 2.2 and 2.3

Hi'all,
It may be `old news' given the number of reports, but it is bad news so I'll
report it anyway. There is a `reliable way to hang Linux' (no pun intended) on
both the 2.2 and 2.3.<=33 (at least, no info on later versions) series of
kernels involving the use of SCSI and sound at the same time. When I do
anything more complicated on the SCSI bus while playing sound (mp3's actually,
but that's beside the point), the system locks up after some random amount of
time, without logging anything out of the ordinary. I've seen it playing along
for half a song (1.5 minutes), and I;ve seen it freeze a second after I started
mpg123, and anything in between. It happens while reading from (SCSI) CD-ROM,
writing to (SCSI) CD-RW, accessing the (SCSI) tape drive, etcetera. Anything
SCSI is `not done' while using the sounds board it seems. I've seen a lot of
reports on this issue, but no fixes.  Since it is still present in the current
development series, now is the time to tackle the problem I'd say... And since
there is NOTHING in the logfiles to track down this problem it will be a nasty
one...
My setup includes:
HW: Intel Endeavour Mboard
     + P166
     + 96 MB RAM
     + PCI
        + Diamond Stealth 3200
        + ne2k-pci (eth0)
     + ISA
        + Creative SB 16 Basic (io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=7 mpu_io=0x310)
           + opl3 io=0x388
        + 3c509 irq=12 (eth1, cable modem connected)
        + AHA1542CF (io=0x330, dma=6, irq=11, internal termintation OFF)
           + iomega JAZ 1 GB (external removable drive)
           + Yamaha CRW 4416 (internal CD-RW)
SW: Linux 2.2.n (13 <= n <= 14pre16)
    Linux 2.3.33
    (both heavily modularized)
    Loaded modules:
      serial
      nfsd
      lockd
      sunrpc
      3c509
      ne2k-pci
      8390
      opl3 [no autoclean]
      sb   [no autoclean]
      uart401  [no autoclean]
      sound  [no autoclean]
      soundcore  [no autoclean]
    glibc 2.1.2
Again, NO logging on these hanfs/lockups/freezes, so it is rather difficult to
produce more info.
Cheers//Frank
