Very cool, thanks for benching!

This is not surprising, since:
* the scatter-gather table imposes a limit of 8MB
* the VM further imposes limits on readahead and writeback
So 32MB is the hardware max, but not really achieveable due to other 
factors.

Yeah, this is only found in the bleeding-edge-latest 2.6.x kernels.  You 
did the right thing...
