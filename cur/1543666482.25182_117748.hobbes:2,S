Subject: 2.5.64-mm8: link error with CONFIG_NUMA and !CONFIG_SMP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I get many errors at the final linking when compiling a kernel with
CONFIG_NUMA enabled but CONFIG_SMP disabled:
<--  snip  -->
...
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.5/linux-2.5.64-mm8/include/asm/topology.h:41: 
undefined reference to `cpu_2_node'
...
<--  snip  -->
the problem is that include/asm-i386/topology.h says:
<--  snip  -->
...
#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
...
extern volatile int cpu_2_node[];
...
<--  snip  -->
but cpu_2_node is in arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c that only gets included 
with CONFIG_SMP.
