What on earth is the point of adding congestion control to COMMIT?
Strongly NACKed.
Why 16MB of on-the-wire data? Why not 32, or 128, or ...
Solaris already allows you to send 2MB of write data in a single RPC
request, and the RPC engine has for some time allowed you to tune the
number of simultaneous RPC requests you have on the wire: Chuck has
already shown that read/write performance is greatly improved by upping
that value to 64 or more in the case of RPC over TCP. Why are we then
suddenly telling people that they are limited to 8 simultaneous writes?
