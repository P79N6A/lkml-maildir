Theodore, with all due respect, I think you are being a bit tough on
Richard. It is inevitable that initial acceptance of an idea requires some
smooth talking and convincing whilst when the idea is accepted one could
go on and gently push humans towards doing the right thing as a norm as
opposed to as "optional". There is
nothing wrong about that. Richard pushed me a bit towards converting
microcode to devfs and my only resistance (as I found out) was due to
ignorance - when that is overcome I am only grateful to him that he cared
enough to convince me.
Regards,
Tigran.
