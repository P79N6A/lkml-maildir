Hi,
That change was my fault, to address a problem with doing a resume from
suspend.  The e100 in my laptop seems to emit a spurious interrupt on
resume, and the intention was to block interrupts until the handler had
been installed - otherwise I get a "got interrupt X and nobody cared"
message.
While this works for me (probably because IRQ11 is heavily shared), it's
apparently pretty bogus.  But it did achieve the goal of getting the
problem looked at...
