OK, I've written something that does this (but only correctly for ext3). 
I've put it here:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~bsamwel/bootup_prefetch.tar.gz
I haven't had the opportunity to do good measurements, so I don't really 
know if it even increases performance. If anyone feels like benchmarking 
this, I'd be very happy to hear from you. I don't really expect 
performance increases, as the bootup scripts seem to have enough 
processing to do to keep the system busy even without disk I/O. I wonder 
if it might make a difference on a faster processor though, my system's 
kind of sluggish by today's standards.
