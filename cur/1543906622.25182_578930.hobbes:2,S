 I'll try more stuff tonight. A wild guess of the problem would be the amount
of interrupts from the serial port (I was sending if that matters).
 I never seen the problem without the modem connection, this PC is stable
for ia32/ia64 for few months.

 Browsing alone over the modem did not seem to trigger the problem, but
I will do more tests with/without X/browser and ia32/ia64 tonight.
 Etienne.
