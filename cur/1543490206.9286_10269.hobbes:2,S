   Linux tcp bug. Quite clear
 ...
   They reply to our connection with a zero window - weird but legal
But this isn't what triggers the bug.
It's the "other" weird thing happening here, no MSS option,
the MSS ends up being ~0 of all things.  2.0 handled this
properly, and I was even the person who fixed it up there. :(
I'm working on a fix.
Later,
