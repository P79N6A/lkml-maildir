struct inode and structures containing it should not be used outside of kernel.
Moreover, foo_fs.h should be seriously trimmed down and everything _not_
useful outside of kernel should be taken into fs/foo/*; other kernel code
also doesn't give a fsck for that stuff, so it should be private to filesystem
instead of polluting include/linux/*.
