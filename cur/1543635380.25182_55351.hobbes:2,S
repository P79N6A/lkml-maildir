Error in IRQ routing on Intel 82820 USB module.
This error was found comparing the IRQ assigned to USB device at boot 
and at lspci, and causes the USB to stop of work.
The kernel in question is 2.4.18, but i also test in 2.4.18-5mdk.
i find this path, and how was not made by me, i "pass the ball" ...
Please send credits to him...
