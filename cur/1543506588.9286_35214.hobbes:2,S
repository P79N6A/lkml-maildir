Why do we need access to 4GB RAM?  If your gona run databases that need that 
much use more powerful computers that have support for it. Maybe IBM AIX???? 
Thats what we use at GTE.  I thought  I saw support for this in 2.2.11 or 
maybe that was 2GIG. Plus the only MB's I have seen only support 1024MB.
