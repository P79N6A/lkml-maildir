Why moving the mouse a little (that causes a microscopic % of CPU
being used) makes X priority jump up to 29 from 6/7 ???
And why this doesn't happen when glxgears (for example) is running?
(under cpu load this is different, with X never getting "good"
priority -- if I remember correctly)
Maybe this is normal and depends on the way X sleeps or something...
I don't know much about schedulers but if I'm able to make the cursor
going in jerks with just a bit of CPU load (linux$ make -j16, for
example) I wonder why X cannot get a better priority...
