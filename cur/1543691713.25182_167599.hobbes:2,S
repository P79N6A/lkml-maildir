Seems Andrew merged a different version of the options patch than the
one that was posted to the list. I can make a fixup tonight.
Also, from looking at the test5-mm4 patch, I think that match_number()
from lib/parser.c is ignoring the base argument and using a hardcoded
value of zero for the simple_strtol() call. This should result in
match_octal() and match_hex() being broken (well, being the same as
match_int).
