Yes, this is a s-l-o-w machine, I try to build as much as possible while
I'm at lunch, in meetings, etc. So the fail to find the modules was mine,
the bad error message was a result. And of course it would be nice if all
the modules which compiled in 2.5.59 would still compile in 2.5.63, so I
could spend time trying to debug why the aha152x doesn't actually *work*
if it has to share an interrupt. Since I can't change the IRQ of this old
stuff short of ripping the boards out and readdressing with a soldering
iron, I was hoping to take another path.
