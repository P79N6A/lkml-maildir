Actually in rearranging it.  jiffies should probably be redefined as
the smallest sleep we are prepared to take.  And then HZ because the
number of those smallest sleeps per second.  So we might see HZ values
up in the millions but otherwise things should be pretty much as
normal.
It's an interesting question though.  How large should HZ be with
programmable timers.
