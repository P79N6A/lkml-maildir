Are there any known problems in booting 2.4.16 on the Alpha?
The kernel builds cleanly, but then somewhere near the beginning
of the boot sequence it just hangs...
Im going to have to go back and re-build an older kernel just to be
sure that Im not missing something, but for now would like to know that
Im not wasting my time with 2.4.16.
