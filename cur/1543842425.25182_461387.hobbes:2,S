You shouldn't have to what?  You purposefully add and remove a block
driver as fast as is possible, creating a ton of new events and you
expect userspace processing of those events to be able to keep up in
real-time with it?
On the later versions of udev we are _way_ faster, we only listen to the
netlink socket, no extra programs are spawned, but still, we can only
work so fast :)
My machine had no interactive response issues while this was happening,
even with both processors being run at 100% cpu usage until I stoped the
loop and then udev recovered a few seconds later.  This is even with
HALD recieving all of these events from udev, remember it's not just
udev in the event processing chain.
