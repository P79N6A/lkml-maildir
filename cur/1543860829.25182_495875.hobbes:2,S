High probability is all you have.  Cosmic radiation hitting your
computer will more likly cause problems, than colliding 64bit inode
numbers ;)
But you could add a new interface for the extra paranoid.  The
proposed 'samefile(fd1, fd2)' syscall is severly limited by the heavy
weight of file descriptors.
Another idea is to export the filesystem internal ID as an arbitray
length cookie through the extended attribute interface.  That could be
stored/compared by the filesystem quite efficiently.
But I think most apps will still opt for the portable intefaces which
while not perfect, are "good enough".
