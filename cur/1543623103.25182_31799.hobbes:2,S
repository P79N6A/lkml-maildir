Peter,
I need a major number for NetWare volumes.  In the new NWFS model,
I am now mapping nwfs stripped and mirrored volumes beneath 
the buffer cache as devices (the way it should have been to start
with) and I am using Linus' buffer cache for NWFS rather than 
my own.
To do this, I have been using the experimental ranges, but for 
posting the code, I need an assigned one.  Is there a major number
available I can use for block devices.
Info provided:
block device
/dev/nwd0
/dev/nwd1
/dev/nwd.. etc.
major device (Peter Assigns) minor numbers 0-255
for a total of 256 local NetWare volumes.  On native NetWare,
256 is the limit per server for the number of local volumes
available.
Thanks,
Respectfully Submitted,
:-)
Jeff
