Looks like a candidate for gstreamer on the userspace end. Can it be
decoupled enough to make proper plugins out of it?

The API Eric Miao just posted for the PXA looks sane to me.

Especially when it comes to userspace visible things.

Yup, looks like it would be better to cook it another round instead of
trying to bring in a half-tested driver with brute-force.
