kbuild checks for any differences in the commandline alos - so a rebuild
happens if you change options to gcc (think -O2 => -Os).
If you experience that for example mm/slab.c is rebuild then try to
do the following:
cp mm/.slab.o.cmd foo
make mm/
diff -u foo mm/.slab.o.cmd
If diff detects any difference then you know why and need to find out
why there is a difference.
Btw. what make version and what kernel version are you compiling?
There was some inconsistency in kbuild that triggered with make 3.81-rc1
and which will trigger with make 3.82-cvs also.
This issue was only fixed lately - recall it was for 2.6.16
