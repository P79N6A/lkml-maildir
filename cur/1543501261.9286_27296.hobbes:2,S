tasklist_lock is declared in include/linux/sched.h and defined in
kernel/sched.c. As far as I know there is no way that symbol could be
undefined - SMP systems in particular need that lock. Since the symbol
is defined in sched.c, failing to compile in /proc wouldn't give you
that particular error.
Probably your user miscompiled your module. Maybe your user is using
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS and you aren't?
just guessing...
