Here's a preempt trace output from mono. To compile preempt-trace.patch I 
remove the traps.c patch and added u32 definition for out_count in handle.c. 
After those changes, the kernel compiled fine.
Now here's the output, let me know if it is ok, or if you can make any reveals 
where the bug is located.
BUG: mono[10011] exited with nonzero preempt_count 1!
---------------------------
| preempt count: 00000001 ]
| 1 level deep critical section nesting:
----------------------------------------
.. [<ffffffff803f791e>] .... _spin_lock+0xe/0x70
.....[<0000000000000000>] ..   ( <= 0x0)
If there is anything I should test, let me know!
