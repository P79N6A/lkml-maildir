It's probably too late for that sort of thing now in 2.5 though.

Oh, in that case you should have no problem getting it from ZONE_NORMAL,
especially if you can wake up kswapd and wait for a few seconds.

Personnally I don't have a problem setting aside that much space at boot
time, but it's probably not a good solution for small boxes.

Maybe IFF you want to suppork kexec on panic, it should be statically
reserved at boot time? You don't want to be mucking around in the panic
path trying to swap out memory, etc. when your kernel is halfway down
the toilet already ... and that has nothing to do with memory placement,
it's just a space issue.

Oh, just do alloc_pages_node(0) (works on non NUMA as well, will just 
fall back). But I can show you a 32Gb SMP box as well ;-) ZONE_NORMAL 
is probably still easiest, and most general.
