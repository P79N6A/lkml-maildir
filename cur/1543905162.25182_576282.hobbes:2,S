OK, it took more time than I had hoped, but I wanted CONFIG_HIBERNATION and
CONFIG_SUSPEND to be really independent of each other.
The two patches in the next messages implement the idea:
* replace CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND with CONFIG_HIBERNATION
* introduce CONFIG_SUSPEND that selects CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, if necessary,
  and make it possible to choose suspend and hibernation independently of each
  other.
Greetings,
