Subject: [PATCH] slab: removes local_irq_save()/local_irq_restore() pair
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/21/61

Proposed by and based on a patch from Eric Dumazet <dada1@cosmosbay.com>:
This patch removes unnecessary critical section in ksize() function, as 
cli/sti are rather expensive on modern CPUS.
It additionally adds a docbook entry for ksize() and further simplifies 
the code.
