I've just looked at this and there isn't that much code duplicated, just
a couple of big comment blocks which make it look like that. Those
sections are similar in spirit but have been modified to work under
different circumstances. Having looked again, I don't think its worth
trying to merge them as it will become too unreadable.
Cheers,
Richard
