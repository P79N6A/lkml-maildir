Hello,
 	We have a custom compiled Linux Kernel running oh RHEL 3.1
 		[root@st0056_1 root]# uname -a
 		Linux st0056_1 2.4.21-32.0.1.ELcustom #12 SMP Wed Sep 14 11:55:22 EDT 2005 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
 	We compiled in SLIP support using the standard RHEL kernel supplied by Redhat. Unfortunately, RH does not support SLIP. We are experiencing problems that we believe are a kernel issue (either SLIP or SERIAL) and are interested in hiring a contractor to diagnose the problem and provide a kernel patch to the kernel we are using (if necessary). We do not want to upgrade or change distributions at this time (business/practicality reasons).
 	If you are interested, please send an e-mail with your resume (doc, odf, or plain text) to 'gerald.edward.butler@gmail.com' (I'll provide a private e-mail address to interested parties).
 	The company website is here:

 Thank You,
