No, indeed.

At the time you it is performed, most devices should not be active
(no long DMA bursts) so the variations should be rather small.
Another solution is to increase the measurement period. I have to 
use one second on some machines because I don't have anything else
reliable (only the RTC which changes every second and its interrupt
pin is not routed), even a 1 to 2 second delay does not significantly
affect boot times.

On the Macs I have around here, the ntp drift values are:
- on a PB G3/400: +8ppm
- on a PM G4/466: -6ppm
that's not _that_ bad (I believe these come from OF). 
10 ppm of a 10ms jiffy is 0.1 microseconds. Increasing HZ can only 
improve this figure, although it is stupid to run the correction loop 
that often IMNSHO.
I repeat the question: what are the values of drift on the machines
that encounter the problem ? Is this drift stable or unstable?

The worst variations of drift I've seen are a few ppm for a given
machine, barring the occasional boot-time calibration problems that
I have encountered.
