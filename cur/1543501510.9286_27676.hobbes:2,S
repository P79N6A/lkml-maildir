In an ideal world, the kernel includes would include a .mk file that
my Makefile can include that does all those silly defines for me.
(There are other things, like -fno-fp-regs, -ffixed-8 for the alpha, etc.)
As it stands now, I have to guess for each architecture what is right.
I think is is reasonable for a .mk to be generated, because there are
a few .h files in the kernel includes that are generated as well.
And __SMP__ does bring up some interesting issues with distributing
modules.
