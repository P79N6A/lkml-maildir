Not necessarily ioctl() - Ted's suggestion is that we extend the API between 
the line discipline and the low level driver to support these requirements, 
and then implement our half-duplex protocols as line disciplines.

Mostly, we have FIFOs in hardware and we don't actually receive each byte. 
IIRC, the behaviour of a 16550a is to interrupt either when the FIFO gets to a 
certain fullness, or if there's data in the FIFO and then an idle period. 
If the latter is configurable, then we can set it to 33 bit times, and then 
any interrupt without a full FIFO tells us that there was an idle period.
I'm not actually working on this code yet, so I'm not really in a position to 
say whether what you're proposing is enough. It looks OK, though, at first 
glance.
