I confess I feel that this new model is a return to the bad old days 
when the stable tree wasn't. Sounds as if Andrew is bored with the idea 
of letting 2.7 be the development tree and just being the gatekeeper of 
STABLE new features for 2.6. Perhaps 2.7 should be opened and Andrew 
will have a place to play, and features can drift to 2.6 more slowly.
I agree that vendor kernels often have unexpected behaviour, 
"improvements" on the API, etc. They sometimes protect the user from 
himself, so that code which works fine on a vendor kernel fails 
miserably on a mainline kernel.
I'm sure developers will do whatever they please, but I think a 
development kernel would be nice about now, so people could try new 
things without restriction, and people who like to use a stable kernel 
could have one.
