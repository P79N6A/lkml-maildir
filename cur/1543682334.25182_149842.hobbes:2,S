One day, when it happens, we'll see what ripple effects it has.
In most cases, however, I suspect that a versioned file system will never
be a replacement for a good source management system. The lines could become
blurred, but the 'good versioned file system' might take the form a kernel
module that allowed SCM systems to plug into it, at which point, Bit Keeper
might plug into it, and everybody would be happy. I doubt you want to put
merge manager functionality into the kernel, or many of the other components
of a good source management system. The storage and access is one of the
lesser concerns. Bit Keeper uses similar storage and access methods as
SCCS, does it not?
