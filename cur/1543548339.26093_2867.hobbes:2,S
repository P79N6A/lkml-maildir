I'm running 2.4.0-test8 and I was able to reach all four of the above sites 
using kppp 2.0pre18. My starter distribution is Linux-Mandrake 7.2 beta 1.
When I ran make xconfig, I left the "networking options" section alone.  In 
the "network device support" section, I said yes to PPP support, PPP support 
for async serial, and PPP deflate compression.  
The bottom line is, 2.4.0-test8 works for me with this setup.  I didn't 
see any options which would enable/disable ECN, but perhaps I overlooked 
something. I did grep for ECN in Documentation and Documentation/networking, 
but just turned up entries for DECNET. And yes, I did a uname -r to make sure 
that I really was running 2.4.0-test8.
Offtopic for this thread, I'm using ReiserFS 3.6.14 with the 
reiserfs-3.6.14-test8-pre5 patch which seems to work for test8 final.  So 
far, so good anyway.
This is my first post to linux-kernel.  I'm not subsribed to the list, so 
please cc any comments to elenstev@mesatop.com.
