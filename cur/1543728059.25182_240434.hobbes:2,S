yeah, and in addition we've already pushed 99% of our might_sleep()
additions to -mm too so that reduces the patch size too, quite
significantly.
time is the only limiting factor. Due to these partial merges (we are
trying to get all uncontroversial bits into -mm, hence into upstream)
the merge to -mm is hard. Especially for lock-breaks that i've done
differently than Andrew. I sent a consolidation patch yesterday but this
is still work in progress. So i'll do an -mm merge very time i get to do
it, but the primary testing still remains on the vanilla kernel (which
most people use).

both softirq threading and hardirq threading will be done separately,
yes. Also, most of the switches and source-level distinctions between
cond_resched and voluntary_resched variants can go away too. The
'-clean' patch in the voluntary-preempt directory shows how it would
look like in the end.

the plan right now is to push all the known-good stuff into 2.6.9 once
2.6.8 is out. That will unify all the improvements in a natural way. The
latest update kernel of FC2 also includes an earlier version of the
voluntary-preempt patch (sans any irq threading bits) - and it worked
out fine so far.
