Subject: failure of cache_alloc_refill to terminate

I am running a UserModeLinux of  2.6.19-rc4 vintage. It failed
to stop properly on halt.
Yes, there is some custom code in it, and it is possible that some memory
got walked on.   Attaching GDB to it, shows that it is stuck in:
slab.c, cache_alloc_refill(struct kmem_cache *cachep, gfp_t flags)
in the loop for: while (batchcount > 0) {..}
because the decrement:
     while (slabp->inuse < cachep->num && batchcount--) {
is never performed.
I don't know why slabp->inuse < cachep->num, but because it
it is never true, the batchcount never gets decremented.
Since, I think the point of the batchcount was to prevent it
from trying too hard, I am uncertain if it was intended that
the batchcount not decrement if the inuse check fails.
I think the point was to limit how many things we add to
the slab at once.
(Yes, I suspect that the slab got corrupted.)
