Hi,
A strange question just occurred in my brain, rather randomly - is it
possible to copy individual tracks from a minidisk (you know those modern
MD thingies) if your soundcard has a optical connector?
I am thinking about something along the lines of audiofs which lets you
mount audiocds and presents each track as a WAV file. Could one write a
similar minidiskfs? I.e. does soundcard allow access to the data in some
raw way at all?
Regards,
