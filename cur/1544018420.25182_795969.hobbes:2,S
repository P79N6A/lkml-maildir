My HP 2510p notebook has the device. By chance I activated the driver with 
my last few builds and at least the input device works perfectly with 
the -rc2 kernel (tested with jstest and Tux Racer).
What are the differences relative to -rc2? Looks like it adds the freefall 
device?
Could you please give some additional info what exactly you want tested, 
how to test it, and how safe it is to do the test?
I'd be willing to test, but not if to do so I'd have to throw the notebook 
out of the window... Or even if there is the slightest risk of somehow 
damaging the hard disk.
Cheers,
FJP
