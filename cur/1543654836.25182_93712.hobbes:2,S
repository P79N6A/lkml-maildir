Oooh,  I had lengthy discussion with andrea on those two.  These patches
are a) grossly misnamed and b) should be one.  They change xtime to a volatile
because andrea thinks that's safer.
The background on the silly naming is that earlier 2.4 kernels had xtime
not volatile but the prototype (or vice versa) and gcc3 didn't like that.
So the best idea would be to merge them into 00_xtime_volatile-1 if
you want to keep them.
