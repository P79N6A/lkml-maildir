It's too easy.  All you have to do is note the significant overlap
between the KS program committee and the TAB.
Program Committee
  Jens Axboe, Oracle
* James Bottomley, SteelEye
  Jonathon Corbet, LWN.net
  Steve Hemminger, OSDL/The Linux Foundation
  Dirk Hohndel, Intel
  Gerrit Huizenga, IBM
  Dave Jones, Red Hat
  Andi Kleen, Novell
* Greg Kroah-Hartman, Novell/SuSE Labs
* Matthew Mackall, Selenic Consulting
* Andrew Morton, Google
* Theodore Ts'o, IBM
TAB members:
* James Bottomley
  Wim Coekaerts
  Randy Dunlap
* Greg Kroah-Hartman
  Christoph Lameter
* Matt Mackall
* Andrew Morton
* Theodore Ts'o
  Arjan van de Ven
  Chris Wright
There you have it.  Half of the board sit on the committee who decides
who their electorate are!
On a serious note, James, I think you mis-spoke when you said that
Andrew Morton's term was up this year.,  My understanding is that people
are elected for two years, and he was elected last year, so my list of
people whose terms are up is:
Wim Coekaerts
Greg Kroah-Hartman
Christoph Lameter
Arjan van de Ven
According to the August minutes, Randy was elected back to the TAB then,
so there's actually only four slots up for re-election this year.
