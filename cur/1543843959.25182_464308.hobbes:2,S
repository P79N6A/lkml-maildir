I cannot find.
ip_queue does. But it is just another user, not different of sockets.
BTW in any case, any user of timestamp who sees 0, because skb was received
before timestamping was enabled, has to calculate timestamp itself right
in the place where Andi suggested. Seems, preparation to the change
makes sense even without the change. :-)
