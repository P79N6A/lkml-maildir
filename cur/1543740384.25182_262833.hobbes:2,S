Hmm, I admit I missed arm case but for x86 should work actually:
in arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:
static int suspend(int vetoable)
{
        int             err;
        struct apm_user *as;
        if (pm_send_all(PM_SUSPEND, (void *)3)) {
                /* Vetoed */
                if (vetoable) {
                        if (apm_info.connection_version > 0x100)
                                set_system_power_state(APM_STATE_REJECT);
                        err = -EBUSY;
                        ignore_sys_suspend = 0;
                        printk(KERN_WARNING "apm: suspend was vetoed.\n");
                        goto out;
                }
                printk(KERN_CRIT "apm: suspend was vetoed, but suspending anyway.\n");
        }
        device_suspend(3);
        device_power_down(3);
...
but since you say arm does not care I think we'll proceed with the patch.
