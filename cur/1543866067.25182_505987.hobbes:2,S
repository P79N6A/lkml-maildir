Dear Francois:
I think I didn't make it clear about the programming manuals for PCI-E ICs.
Due to several legal issues, Realtek won't put the programming guide on 
its website. However, Realtek does offer the programming guide if the 
customers need it. If you want to have a copy of it, please contact 
Realtek FAE<ryankao@realtek.com.tw>.
Best Regards,
Edward 2007/02/07
