Ok, I somewhat confused as the sequence in psmouse_pm_callback is pretty
much the same as in rescan/reconnect. Wait...
Does suspend/resume work at all if you don't set psmouse_resetafter to 1??
The reason I am asking is that we have alot of different PM interfaces and
this one is marked as deprecated. If it is not called during resume it would
leave the touchpad in relative mode while kernel expects absolute and spews 
"lost sync" messages... Until Synaptics decides that it's time to reset 
after X bad packets. Does it make any sense?
Btw, Synaptics is intergated into psmouse module so you don't really need
to edit the source to set resetafter parameter. Either pass 
"psmouse_resetafter=X" to the kernel on boot if psmouse compiled in or
pass it to modprobe.
