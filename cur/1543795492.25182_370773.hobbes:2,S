This was funny and what is also sometimes considered as ASSUMING something
and JUMPING to conclusion and JUDGING people without knowing them.
My actual name is Vishal Soni and my email address for personal
communication is
vishal.soni.1@gmail.com
I created email address vishal.linux so that i can dedicate one email
address to the mailing lists for my linux interest and the hundred of
mails, which keeps coming to the mailing list does not block my
personal mails.
You wrote.........
" Pretending that you are Linux on your own will not make you popular"
I don't really give damn to the popularity. I am just another open
source community fan, who is trying to learn about linux and enjoy it.
And open source community dudes are no fools that they wud be getting
this kind of weird feeling and wud make any X,Y,Z........ The LINUX
owner :).
This also reminds me about the real meaning of assume,
 (ASSuME) "Making Ass out of You and Me."
So please don't judge the people without knowing them. Every one's way
of thinking and doing things is different.

Yeah this is not to be done..........

As i said........ in the subject i was trying to .........
to get SDA/SCL bit position in the control word register of the video card?
so that i can communicate to the monitor......... without hardcoding
the offset of control word register in my code for every different
card.

Yes i am studying the code.......of read-edid .
Thankyou for your time.
