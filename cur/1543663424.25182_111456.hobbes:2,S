   IP is best-effort. Dropping packets in odd cases to make locking simpler
   is not unreasonable. Would you prefer an slower kernel?
True.
But this is a quality of implementation issue and I doubt the kernel
would be slower if we fixed this silly behavior.
Frankly, the locking is due to lazyness, rather than a specific design
decision.  So let's fix it.
