Yep, and it does not sound unreasonable to have mlock succeed on hugepage
areas (though I'm not reading any standardese). And you wouldn't expect
mlockall to fail if an app is using hugepages either.
I don't have an idea off the top of my head though. Don, an strace log of
the failing sequence of syscalls could be helpful.
