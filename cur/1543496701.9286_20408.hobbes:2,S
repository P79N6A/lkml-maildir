It will, since that's the wrong version to patch from. Based on the
tarball and patch files on the SunSITE uk mirror at...
   
ftp://SunSITE.Org.UK/Mirrors/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
...I would assume the following to be the correct sequence:
 Q>  10534303 Jan 13 22:05 v2.1/linux-2.2.0-pre7.tar.bz2
 Q>    199328 Jan 19 01:52         v2.1/patch-2.2.0-pre8.bz2

It should be 23248 bytes, as per the listing above...

{Shrug} Try the URL set given above, it's definately there...
