Note that ordering requirements are usually bad requirements. In many
cases it's probably best to just fix the problem that causes ordering
requirements in the first place.
So we don't need to do a "perfect" job on ordering. In fact, we probably
want to avoid ordering as much as possible - I'd rather fix the problems
that cause us to want to order thing than spending much time trying to
order stuff.
Some ordering is simple: making sure that newer drivers show up before
older drivers that can catch on compatibility stuff. Some other cases are
equally obvious: keeping the sort in pretty much the same order as the old
hosts.c file just to avoid having peoples disks being re-ordered if
somebody has multiple types of SCSI controllers. That's more of a "let's
be polite" thing.
But let's fix the real problems rather than hit our heads against the
ordering wall..
