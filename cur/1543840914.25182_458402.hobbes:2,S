That might help, but SIOCGIWNAME just gets a string that
says what wireless mode the device is in, not the device
name.  Althought NetworkManager might use this for something
interesting.
All of the interesting config calls are probably happening
via netlink, which doesn't get decoded by strace.
But changes via netlink can get traced by using "ip" in monitor mode,
try "ip monitor all" as root during such a NetworkManager run.
