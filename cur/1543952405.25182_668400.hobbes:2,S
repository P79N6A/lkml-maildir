Thank you very much for your testing, and for isolating the
cause of this regression.

How long does hackbench take to complete on 2.6.25-rc5?
Does -mm1 hang completely?  Or is it making slow progress?

I'll revert it while I investigate the cause of this
problem and try to find a way to avoid this problem.

Me too!
