Of course not.
Why should they be?
What's considered bad form is:
 - assignments in boolean context (because of the confusion of "=" and 
   "==")
 - thinking the constant "0" is a pointer.
There's no reason why "if (!ptr)" would be wrong. That has zero confusion 
about 0 vs NULL.
The confusion about "0" is that in traditional C it means two things: it 
can either be an integer (the common case) or it can sometimes be a 
pointer. That kind of semantic confusion is bad.
But it has nothing to do with the _value_ zero, or testing pointers for
being non-NULL. The value zero is not about semantic confusion, it's just 
a bit pattern. And testing pointers is not ambiguous: when you test a 
pointer, it's _un_ambigiously checking that pointer for NULL.
Problems arise when there is room for confusion, and that's when the 
compiler should (and does) warn. If something is unambiguous, it's not 
bad.
