Sure, force this be only allowing C code in the kernel and its device
drivers.  I'm 100% for that.
But why disallow a third-party kernel-space application from using C++
if they want to?  We're not talking about the kernel, we're talking
about third-party code that will never be part of the kernel.
C++ has a lot of useful compile-time features -- you don't need
exception handling.  Classes being the obvious one.  (In fact I've
written C++ for many years and _never_ used exceptions).
Though perhaps C++'s most useful feature for third-party code is that
there's a lot of it already written for user-space and other OSes.
