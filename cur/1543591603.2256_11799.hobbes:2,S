clone(), walk(), clunk(), stat() and open() ;-) Basically, we can add
unopened descriptors. I.e. no IO until you open it (turning the thing into
opened one), but we can do lookups (move to child), we can clone and
kill them and we can stat them.
It makes tree traversals much easier, but AFAIK nobody had exported that
API directly to userland. Might be a good idea, but it's completely
non-portable...
