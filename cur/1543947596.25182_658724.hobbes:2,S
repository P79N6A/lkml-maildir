I wanted to get the basics right, before thinking about these details.
But getting the semantics of a) right before this is merged is a good
idea, of course...  So I'll have to think about that.
The remount stuff can wait (especially if there will be a new mount
API for this kind of thing).

The limit is there, so that unprivileged users cannot create insane
number of mounts.  It's just a safety thing, analogous to
/proc/sys/fs/file-max.
Thanks for looking at this.
