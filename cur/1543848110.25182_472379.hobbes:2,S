In my opinion, always picking 1024 would be highly suboptimal for some 
architectures (x86-64 in particular -- that's a whole page, just for the 
fdarray!). If anything, I'd prefer something similar to this pseudo-code:
#define FDTABLE_MIN min_t(uint, PAGE_SIZE / 4 / sizeof(struct file *), 1024)
...
nr /= FDTABLE_MIN;
nr = roundup_pow_of_two(nr + 1);
nr *= FDTABLE_MIN;
gcc should be smart enough to optimize that expression into a single constant. 
At least it did (version 4.1.0) in my quick test here.

Let me know what you think. Please don't just go radio-silent on me. ;)
