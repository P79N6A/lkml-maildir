Personally, I'm in full agreement with that, which is why I won't
agree to have kassert() itself call panic() or oops() or any such.

Like you, I can see no benefit to be gained from using kassertoops()
and have it panic, but it seems to be desired...
However, I would not be surprised to find that there are places in the
kernel where if an assumption proves to be false, we would need to
abort the operation that led to that function, and I would see
something like the following being used:
	#define kassertexit(cond,label) \
		if (cond) { \
			/* Do nothing */; \
		} else { \
			printk( ... ); \
			goto label; \
		}
Likewise, in the majority of cases, the jump is probably not required,
so the plain kassert() function would be used that didn't include that
goto line...
Best wishes from Riley.
