Guys,
    Great job, by looking at Dave's posts, he got data from the accel. 
Nice. I'm removing some people from the CC list as I'm getting flooded 
with admin messages from the ML settings and crap... Will leave LKML, 
HDAPS and dev.
    Thanks again. I hope we can make a tarball by the end of the day and 
see what we have.
.Alejandro
