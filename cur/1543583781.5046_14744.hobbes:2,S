What does "formally specified" mean? 
As far as I know, you can count on 16-bytes alignment from
kmalloc. The trouble is that you would have to keep the original
pointer and free that if you have to do the "round" yourself. 
I once wrote a kmalloc(*) that would allow you to free any pointer
inside the kmalloc-ed area. This is dangerous as freeing a random
pointer is more likely to "work". But in this case it would be very
convenient.
