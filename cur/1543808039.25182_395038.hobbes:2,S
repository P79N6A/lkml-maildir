Hi, James.
I haven't really looked at the code carefully, but I think one work 
struct + atomic counter (say pending_reap_cnt) should do it. 
queue_work() guarantees the work is run at least once after the call, so 
bumping pending_reap_cnt and queueing the work in target reap and 
reaping pending_reap_cnt times in the work should work.
