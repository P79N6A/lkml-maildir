After examining the resulting image, Paul has a "clock" line to his
flash device that is a bit noisy. This occasionally causes one
16-bit entity to be clocked into the device twice. 
To detect this going wrong, we could (but only as a configurable 
option), write 255 16-bit words to the device (remember this is PIO!), 
check that DRQ is still active and only then write the last word. 
(at which point DRQ should go inactive).
