Exactly the same problem here.

Probably not the Realtek, I had a Realtek card and switched to a 3c905 and
the freezes still happen (they've been happing since 2.2.10, but have
gotten much less frequent with each version).  I'm running 2.2.12 single
processor, IDE root fs and CDROM, and Adaptec 1542 SCSI.
Could it be a problem with mixed IDE and SCSI drives?  It seems like it
would have come up sooner if that were the case.  Disk activity was
involved in every crash that I can remember.  When there's network
activity I suspect it's incoming mail, but the 04:00 daily cron jobs
sometimes do it, too.
