It shows you consented, yeah.  But I still don't know what it
means legally.  It's ambiguous at best.

Remove a line from a copyrighted work?
Let's say I have a README that says the license is GPL v2.  OK, that
seems to cover things.  Someone goes and gets the file and sees that
it also means v3 can be applied.  Hmmm... aren't they in conflict?
I still think lawyers would have a verbal joy-ride with this.

Probably true.  I've sat in a courtroom and been amazed at how
things went.  Like someone else said, a lawyer looks at something
like the GPL and sees a totally different thing than you or I does.
Something about it being, to them, English words but otherwise a
totally different language.
