Kyle,
In this new system setfacl, chmod, chown, and chgrp
all go away except inside of an emulation layer. File
and directories no longer have permissions. People
have permission to naming patterns. So if you put a
file into a tree or move a tree then those who have
permissions to the tree have access to the files. 
It eliminates the step of having to apply permission
after moving files into a tree. You don't have to
change file permissions because files no longer have
permissions.
