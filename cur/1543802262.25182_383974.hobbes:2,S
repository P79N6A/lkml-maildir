PCIe obviously supports 64bit addressing. Do newer revisions of 
conventional PCI support more than 32bit addressing? What about PCI-X? TIA.
[sbp2 depends on a <= 32bit address space of the host bus. Single-chip 
FireWire PCIe adapters are available now but I believe they are merely 
based on a PCI FireWire link layer controller plus PCI-PCIe bridge.]
