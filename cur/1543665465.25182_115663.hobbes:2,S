Bad...
What are you trying to solve? After driver calls pci_unregister_driver,
it is sure that there are no other users of this pci driver. So I do
not understand why you are adding these additional protections (and one
in remove looks suspicious to me: if you unplug device while module
in unloading, you do not call remove?! who will call it then? you'll
not get oopses in pci_unregister_driver? leaked memory?). Driver
authors simple have to unregister from subsystems in correct order,
no try_module_get() put anywhere is not going to solve this problem.
There is simple no relation between modules and drivers - and anyone
who is trying to force this is misguided. Driver starts its life
inside call to *_register_*, and ceases in *_unregister_*, not 
somewhere after call to init_module, and before cleanup_module.
And if module registers resources in wrong order, module has to
cope with its stupidity, not kernel (and I have yet to see two
kernel interfaces which cannot be properly ordered for both init 
and shutdown).
