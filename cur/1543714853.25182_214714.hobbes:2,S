I don't think that's the whole story.  They question is why.

Perhaps.  I think it is more important that it is still mapped.

It still takes a long time.  I'm watching the network load as I
perform the ls.  There's almost 20 seconds of no screen activity while
NFS reloads the code.

Doesn't seem to matter.  I've used v2, v3, UDP and TCP.
I have more data.
All of these tests are performed at the console, one command at a
time.  I have a telnet daemon available, so I open a second connection
to the target system.  I run a continuous loop of file copies on the
console and I execute 'ls -l /proc' in the telnet window.  It's a
little slow, but it isn't unreasonable.  Hmm.  I then run the copy
command in the telnet window followed by the 'ls -l /proc'.  It works
fine.  I logout of the console session and perform the telnet window
test again.  The 'ls -l /proc takes 30 seconds.
When there is more than one process running, everything is peachy.
When there is only one process (no context switching) I see the slow
performance.  I had a hypothesis, but my test of that hypothesis
failed.
