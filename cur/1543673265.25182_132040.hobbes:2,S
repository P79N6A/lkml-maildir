   Work -- no.  Thought?  A little.  Seems to me that MSIs need to be
   treated as a third form of interrupts (level/edge/message).
The fact that Alpha already supports them pretty much transparently
suggests that the thing to do might very well be "nothing" :-)
To be honest, MSIs are very similar to how interrupts work on sparc64,
in that each device generates a unique interrupt cookie.  The only
different is the size of this cookie, MSIs are larger than sparc64's.
