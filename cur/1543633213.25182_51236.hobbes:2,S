Ugh. Yes, I guess the very act of starting the DMA
could evict a few. In that case, your method won't
work either.
It sure would be nice to get the DMA started early,
but that would require some way to keep new stuff
out of the cache.
Well gee, the MPC7400 has such an ability. I don't
know if it's fast, but one could do:
1. write back cache lines that cross unaligned boundries
2. sync
3. set L2CR[L2DO] and L2CR[L2IO] (and maybe HID0[DLOCK] too)
4. start the DMA
5. invalidate all cache lines affected by the DMA
6. undo step 3 (clear L2CR[L2DO], L2CR[L2IO], HID0[DLOCK])
Most likely the above needs another sync or two.

As noted in another email, that was a mistake.
It might be good to invalidate anyway, since
that frees up cache lines for other uses.
The process won't get a chance to touch the page
unless you have SMP or (maybe) preemption.
