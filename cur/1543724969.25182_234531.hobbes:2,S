[PATCH] I2C: Refine detection of LM75 chips
The LM75 detection method was a bit loose so far and would accept
non-LM75-compatible chips from times to times. It should be better now.
Additionally, the help for the lm75 driver was reworked because we now
know that the LM75 and the LM77 are not compatible.

+
+	  The DS75 and DS1775 in 10- to 12-bit precision modes will require
+	  a force module parameter. The driver will not handle the extra
+	  precision anyhow.
 
 	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
 	  will be called lm75.
