I have a VGN-something-or-other notebook and I use this driver regularly.
The place to start (please) is the patches in -mm:
2.6-sony_acpi4.patch
sony_apci-resume.patch
sony_apci-resume-fix.patch
acpi-add-backlight-support-to-the-sony_acpi.patch
acpi-add-backlight-support-to-the-sony_acpi-v2.patch
video-sysfs-support-take-2-add-dev-argument-for-backlight_device_register-sony_acpi-fix.patch
It presently has both the /proc and /sys/.../backlight/.. interfaces, so the first
job would be to chop out the /proc stuff.
