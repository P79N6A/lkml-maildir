Ah, OK.
I did read the changelog, but you added quite a bit of translation ;)

No, doing the throttling per-zone won't in itself fix the deadlock.
Here's a deadlock example:
Total memory = 32M
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio = 10
dirty_threshold = 3M
ratelimit_pages = 1M
Some program dirties 4M (dirty_threshold + ratelimit_pages) of mmap on
a fuse fs.  Page balancing is called which turns all these into
writeback pages.
Then userspace filesystem gets a write request, and tries to allocate
memory needed to complete the writeout.
That will possibly trigger direct reclaim, and throttle_vm_writeout()
will be called.  That will block until nr_writeback goes below 3.3M
(dirty_threshold + 10%).  But since all 4M of writeback is from the
fuse fs, that will never happen.
Does that explain it better?
