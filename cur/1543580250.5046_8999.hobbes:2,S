I wasn't thinking of running the kernel XIP from writable, but even 
trying to do that from the filesystem is a mess. If you're going to be 
that way about it...
/me hands over the crackpipe

The locical answer is run with HZ=10000 so you get 100us intervals, 
right ;o). On systems with multiple hardware timers you could kick off a 
single event at 200us, couldn't you? I've done that before with the 
extra timer assigned exclusively to a resource. It's not a giant time 
slice, but at least you feel like you're allowing something to happen, 
right?
