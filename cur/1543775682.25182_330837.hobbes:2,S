It is important because on UNIX, "root" rules on local filesystems.
I dont't like the idea of root not being able to run "find -xdev" anymore
for administrative tasks, just because something got hidden by accident
or just for fun by a user. It's not about malicious users who want to
hide data: they can do that in tons of ways. The simple "find -xdev"
by root should just not be affected unless there is a very good reason
(SELinux or other "hardened" solutions).
IMHO The best thing FUSE could do is to make the mount totally invisible:
don't return EACCES, don't follow the FUSE mount but stay on the original
tree. I think it's either this or returning EACCES plus the leaf node
constraint at mount time.
The name-space variancy introduced by the first option is only minor:
Mounting anything over a tree which is still in use by a process is
much worse because it tends to be disruptive. And that has always been
possible.
[And I would use the kill() equivalence instead of ptrace() because it
is more appropriate. Doing so avoids the risk of accidentally breaking
useful setuid programs - I don't know if that will happen but I don't
see any security issues here.]
