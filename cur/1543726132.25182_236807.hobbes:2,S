Testing with -L2 and the redirectable_irq change, the xruns triggered by
the keyboard on 8.079 secs boundaries are still here (but the CAPS_LOCK
one is gone since the the redirectable change). I ran some latency tests
with vp:3 kp:0, progressively rising the rtc freqency (2048, 4096), and
I realized that those latency spikes every 8.079 seconds are here even
if I don't touch the keyboard. Here's the typical showtrace output for
those spikes :
T=1.14231 diff=0.978288
 rtc_interrupt (+bd)
 handle_IRQ_event (+50)
 do_hardirq (+bc)
 irqd (+ac)
 kthread (+aa)
 irqd (+0)
 kthread (+0)
 kernel_thread_helper (+5)
The pattern is very similar to the previous one I reported on those
regular xruns :
XRUN: pcmC2D0c
 [<c0105f6e>] dump_stack+0x1e/0x30
 [<c03673b1>] snd_pcm_period_elapsed+0x2e1/0x420
 [<c039d3d4>] snd_hdsp_interrupt+0x174/0x180
 [<c01073bb>] handle_IRQ_event+0x3b/0x70
 [<c0107746>] do_IRQ+0x96/0x150
 [<c0105b14>] common_interrupt+0x18/0x20
 [<c0107746>] do_IRQ+0x96/0x150
 [<c0105b14>] common_interrupt+0x18/0x20
 [<c01030f4>] cpu_idle+0x34/0x40
 [<c054880d>] start_kernel+0x16d/0x190
 [<c010019f>] 0xc010019f
The other source of xrun was seen during the disk write tests, once the
memory runs out (spikes up to 14 ms, but more generally 6 ms)
