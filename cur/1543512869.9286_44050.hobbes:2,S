Whilst such a feature would be possible, I don't think it
would stand a chance of getting into the mainstream kernel.
Think about it. If it did, userspace application writers
would know that they couldn't trust what they got back,
so wouldn't use it.

Again possible, but would probably impact userspace apps.
The paranoia over whether your app reads a real serial number
or a pretend one, would probably put off some people from
using it.

Dave.
