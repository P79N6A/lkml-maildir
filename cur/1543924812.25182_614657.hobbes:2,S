Subject: [PATCH] r/o bind mounts: fix buggy loop
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/6/163

The mnt->__mnt_writers can go negative for a time if
a pair of mnt_want_write()/mnt_drop_write() calls is
done on a different cpu, but for the same mount.
This part is expected.
The lock_and_coalesce..() function should make that
count positive (or at least 0).  Hugh Dickins had
found a bug in the unionfs code which caused a
permanent imbalance in this code, and eventually
underflowed the atomic_t mnt->__mnt_writers.
It also locked up the while() loop that expects the
count to go up after it is coalesced.
The following patch won't fix such a unionfs bug, but
it will keep the loop from locking up.  It will also
warn a lot earlier that something funky is going on.
