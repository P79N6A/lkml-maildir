I didn't get the warnings because my test box still has the prehistoric
version 3.4.4 of gcc. 
I compiled the code with gcc 4.1.1 and got the warnings.
The code does not work because of my carelessness. 
It should have been (*nr_calls)++ in the first place. I apologise.
Thanks for fixing it.
Regards
gautham.
