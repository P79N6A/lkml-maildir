This is not an issue for 2.4 and the place where you portforward is in
the PREROUTING-chain which only get passed packets marked as NEW by the
connection-tracking.
So if you make a new connection from the machine in question and from one
of the ports that's being forwarded it will still work as the packets you
get in response isn't marked as NEW and thereby they aren't passed to
the PREROUTING-chain = not forwarded.
