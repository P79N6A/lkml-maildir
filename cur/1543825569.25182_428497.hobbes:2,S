You change looks right.

You would be interested in reading this file in the kernel sources :

Most important to remember : use "diff -u" to make the patch, and don't
forget to CC the maintainer, particularly on 2.4 patches, because very
few patches are related to 2.4 right now on LKML and it's easy to miss
them. Anyway, your changes are quite self-explanatory and are very easy
to redo by hand. Here's the patch re-done as a diff -u (in fact, as
exported by Git but the output from diff -u would be the same).

Thank you.
Marcelo, this looks valid to me, I've queued it.
