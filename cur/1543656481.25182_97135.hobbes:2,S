Don't know if this patch is the source of this problem, but...
Build fails for drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c where these two functions
	sbp2_handle_physdma_write
	sbp2_handle_physdma_read
are declared with an extra last argument 'u16 flags' in sbp2.h
but are missing this argument in their body in sbp2.c.
