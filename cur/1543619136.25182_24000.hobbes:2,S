I don't think there's a need.  You can use .data.percpu directly
for the boot CPU, dynamically allocate storage for the others.
This actually saves one CPU's worth of memory :)

Well, the slab allocator uses per-CPU data, so with the current patch,
slab.c wouldn't be able to use per_cpu().
But if you use:
 unsigned long __per_cpu_offset[NR_CPUS] = { (unsigned long *)&__per_cpu_start, };
Then each CPU has, at all times, a valid personal __per_cpu_offset[]
entry.   The only restriction is that the boot CPU cannot
touch other CPU's per-cpu data before those CPUs are brought
up.
