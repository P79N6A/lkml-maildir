Many attempts were done on this area on the past.
Your patch has the drawback of using kcalloc(), while previously, module_ref
space was allocated with vmalloc().
After a while, a machine could have a lot of vmalloc() space available, but not enough
physically contiguous space to fullfill a kmalloc(large_area) call.
So a module load could fail, while previous code could load module.
I believe Mike Travis has a better patch for this problem, partly using new percpu allocator.
