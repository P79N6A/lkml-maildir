Right now it is the big kernel lock which is used for this, and the
scheduler drops it anyway for us.  If anyone wants to replace that lock
with another spinlock, then yes, the swapout method would have to drop
it before doing anything which could block.  And that is ugly: having
spinlocks unbalanced over function calls is a maintenance nightmare.
