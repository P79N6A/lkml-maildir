Hi
I wish to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments posted to the list in 
response to this
post
for a system which supports virtual memory concepts, the OS will load
initially some pages from the process address space for execution.
my first question is there any command to get the process physical
memory address or at least the logical?
can we know which pages are loaded?
is that right that despite the possibiliy of a large memory space
availability, windows and may be other os can still use the disk as
repository and perform some page replacements which has an impact on
the process execution?
is there a reason for that, why os can use the physical memory instead
thanks
