I had this problem before. After much debugging and hair pulling I
contacted the manufacturer who said they wern't going to try to figure
out my issue due to my unwillingness to run Win. Went to the store to
replace the motherboard with the same model, the problem persisted.
Replaced the motherboard with a different model the problem completely
went away.
