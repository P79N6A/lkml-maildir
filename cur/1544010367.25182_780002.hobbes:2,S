I am sure we want to have something like that in git.git.

Strike the "either".

Your overview seems to be what "Git from the bottom up" is all about (see 
the Git Wiki for more information where to find it).
From my experience with new users, this is exactly the wrong way to go 
about it.  You don't introduce object types of the Git database before 
telling the users what the heck they are good for.  And most users do not 
need to bother with tree objects either, anyway.  So maybe you just tell 
them what the heck the object types are good for, without even teaching 
them the object types at all.
So I think that your document might do a good job scaring people away from 
Git.  But I do not believe that your document, especially in the tone it 
is written, does a good job of helping Git newbies.
Ciao,

P.S.: No, I haven't read the whole document.  Still, I think I am 
qualified enough to estimate what the average reader's first impression 
would be.
