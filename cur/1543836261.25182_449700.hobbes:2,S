Yes, I noticed this.

It is useful indeed, especially for identifying which types could
actually be or contain pointers. However, with the current Linux API,
the only information that can be passed to kmemleak via the alloc
functions is the size information.
My plan is to post a kmemleak update (some bug-fixes) this weekend and
get some wider testing (maybe in the -mm tree). Once people are happy
with the current implementation, I'll try to add more precise type
checking and introduce new functions (macros) like kmalloc_typed and
kmem_cache_create_typed together with Ingo's algorithm for unique type
ids.
There is another improvement that could be made to reduce the false
negatives - allocate slab objects larger than the required size and
change the offset every time the object is re-allocated. I think this
would be useful not only for kmemleak but also for catching possible
object alterations after it was re-allocated.
