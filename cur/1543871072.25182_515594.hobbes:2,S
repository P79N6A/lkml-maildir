I wouldn't place much value on what you can see just from looking at top. 
Gears just isn't an interactive task and just about anything but gears would 
be a better test case since its behaviour varies wildly under different 
combinations of graphics cards, memory bandwidth, cpu and so on. I'm not even 
sure what you're trying to prove with gears. If it's to see "smooth 
behaviour" under load then gears is not the thing to do it with. Maybe 
unbuffered live video on xawtv or something? Perhaps even capturing video 
where you know what the cpu usage will be of the video codec you're using. 
Say you knew xvid at a fixed bitrate required 30% cpu to encode a live video 
then you could see if it did it real time with a make -j2 running assuming 
you don't run out of disk bandwidth and so on. Or something that required 75% 
cpu and you ran a nice -19 make -j4. Or even try interbench and fiddle with 
the nice values and size of the loads since those options exist and see what 
the latencies and %desired cpu are. By default without arguments interbench 
looks for unfair scheduling and finds plenty of it in other scheduler 
designs. Either way your testcase must mean something to you.

That I definitely agree with.

Curious. On a machine with onboard intel graphics (915 driver), and on an ATI 
r200 dri based driver I can see yields. Yet with the nvidia driver I see no 
yields. This sched_yield seems to be more done by the driver rather than the 
application. That would cause woeful performance. How odd that modern drivers 
out there today are still using this basically defunct unix function. No, I'm 
not interested in getting into a discussion of the "possible" uses of 
sched_yield. That's been done to death many times before.
