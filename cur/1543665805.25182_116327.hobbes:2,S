struct device_driver has a separate reference count than the module 
reference count. In the driver core, this reference count is used. It is 
acquired by taking the bus's lock. 
The module refcount isn't used, because it resides in the driver, so we 
have to guarantee we can dereference the pointer before we deref the 
pointer to increment the refcount. It's a bloody mess, and we work around 
it. 
The driver has an unload_sem that is locked until the driver's refcount 
goes to 0. When it does, it's unlocked. A driver_unregister() call will 
try and take this semaphore while unregistering, meaning it will block 
until outstanding references go away. 
I don't particularly love it, but it's simple enough and it works.  
Ideally, we'd have one reference count and this wouldn't be an issue.  
However, with the evolution of the driver core and the module core in 2.5,
these details haven't had a chance to be worked. I hope in 2.7, we can
achieve more unification between the two.

Greg, and Rusty, are right. Dealing with this is a PITA, and I think will 
always be. I'm willing to take the Nancy Reagan platform, too.
