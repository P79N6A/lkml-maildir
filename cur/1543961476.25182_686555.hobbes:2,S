I contacted WD support, asking for wdidle. They asked about my drive, and
warned me that this application was meant for a specific drive and could
damage others. I replied with information about my drives and never heard
back. I repeated my request, without result.
This mess combined with disappointing performance from a couple of WD
Mybooks will certainly make me think twice before buying or recommending WD
for the foreseeable future.
