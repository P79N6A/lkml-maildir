	Ick! And how is IP X going to get the information back? Broadcast
it, too? Here was me thinking that protocols like BOOTP and DHCP were
appropriate for this.
	If you are going to send from 0.0.0.0, then I assume there's
something in the ARP standard to say "don't cache this ARP request" - I must
have missed it. If so, that's a special case - no need to spoil things
elsewhere, though.

	Well, what do you do currently? If the packet you're routeing came
from another host, there's no way in hell you can use their IP address in an
ARP request ... is there? I certainly hope you don't go that far!!!
	If it's a locally generated packet, then the next hop must be on the
same subnet as the address it's coming from - there's your IP number.

	Multicast uses ARP? That's news to me!
