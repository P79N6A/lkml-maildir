I don't see how Windows 9x can be at fault in any way shape or
form, if you can boot between 2.2.x kernel and 9x no problem, but
lose your disk if you boot Win98 and then 2.3.x/2.4.x and lose
everything.  Windows does not touch your Linux fs's, so if there
is a problem, it most likely is a kernel bug of some kind that
doesn't initialize something properly.
Windows sucks, and I hate it as much (probably more) than the
next guy.  It's not fair to blame every computer problem on it
though unless you KNOW that Windows directly caused the problem.
Pick one of the 1000000000 good reasons to say Windows sucks
instead...
For what it is worth, I have a similar problem where if I boot
Windows (to show people what "multicrashing" is), if I boot back
into Linux, my network card no longer works (via-rhine).  Most
definitely a Linux bug.  In this case, "via-rhine.o" sucks.
