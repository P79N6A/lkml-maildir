The NFS server alone can't prevent the problems Peter Staubach refers
to.  Their frequency also depends on the network and the way you're
using the filesystem.  (A sufficiently paranoid application accessing
the filesystem could function correctly despite the problems caused by
soft mounts, but the degree of paranoia required probably isn't common.)
In practice, you may get away with soft mounts and never see problems.
But other people considering them should probably make sure they
understand the issues before trusting anything important to them.
