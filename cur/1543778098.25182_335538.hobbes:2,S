It is certainly reasonable that you would hope such.
But this hypothetical possibility concerns me a little.  Where would
that leave CKRM, if it was in the mainline kernel, but there was no CPU
controller in the mainline kernel?  Wouldn't that be a rather serious
problem for many users of CKRM if they wanted to work on mainline
kernels?
