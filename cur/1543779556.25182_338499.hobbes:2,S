Not quite.  This is all about the peculiar ptrace case, which sets "force"
to get_user_pages, and ends up handled by the little maybe_mkwrite function:
we sometimes allow ptrace to modify the page while the user does not have
have write access to it via the pte.
Robin discovered a race which proves it's unsafe for get_user_pages to
reset its lookup_write flag (another stage in this peculiar path) after
a single try, Nick proposed a patch which adds another VM_ return code
which each arch would need to handle, Linus looked for something simpler
and hit upon checking pte_dirty rather than pte_write (and removing
the then unnecessary lookup_write flag).
Linus' changes are in the 2.6.13-rc5 mm/memory.c,
but that leaves s390 broken at present.

I agree the pte_write check ought to go back in next to the pte_dirty
check, and that will leave s390 handling most uses of get_user_pages
correctly, but still failing to handle the peculiar case of strace
modifying a page to which the user does not currently have write access
(e.g. setting a breakpoint in readonly text).
