I think you could limit the number of in-flight requests quite
easily, even for drivers that do not use the block layer's
queueing functions.
Aside, you should make 2 or 4 tags the default though: that
still gives you the pipelining without sacrificing latency
and usibility.
The only area (I think) where large queues outperform the IO
scheduler are lots of parallel, scattered reads. I think this
is because the drive can immediately return cached data even
though it looks like a large seek to the IO scheduler.
(This is from testing on my single, old SCSI disk though.)
