I'm curious if zones could be of any benefit in this situation. Could the 
kernel be told to use memory over 64megs only if significant pressure is put 
on the VM, sort of like how we treat the DMA zone now? I suspect this will 
have much lower overhead than using the top 64megs as swap. Any MM gods want 
to comment?
