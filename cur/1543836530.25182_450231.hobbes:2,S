The interrupt holdoff problem is one which is important to Altix users (for
reasons which I've never understood).  Apparently, quite important - this
is I think the third time we've fixed problems in this area for Altix.

invalidate_bdev() calls invalidate_bh_lrus() to release any references
which the bh lru has against the the bdev's pagecache, so that
invalidate_inode_pages() can take down the bdev's pagecache.
If the bdev has no pagecache then there's no need to call
invalidate_bh_lrus(). (or invalidate_inode_pages, or truncate_inode_pages, btw)
(In fact, even if the inode _does_ have pagecache, we still don't need to
call invalidate_bh_lrus(): both invalidate_inodes_pages() and
truncate_inode_pages() will still remove this page from the inode.  The bh
lru is left holding the last reference to the now-anonymous page, and this
will later expire, finally freeing the page).
