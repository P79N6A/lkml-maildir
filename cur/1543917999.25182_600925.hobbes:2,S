Yes, that looks very good to me.  I see it solves a bug that
I hadn't been quite aware of. I don't understand why 
struct host_data is preferable to struct sym_shcb (is it because 
this is the structure that is "naturally protectected" by the 
spinlock?)
My gut instinct is to say "ack", although prudence dictates that 
I should test first. Which might take a few days...

I thought that earlier versions of the driver used waitqueues (I vaguely
remember "eh_wait" in the code), which were later converted to 
completions (I also vaguely recall thinking that the new code was
more elegant/simpler). I converted my patch to use the completions 
likewise, and, as you've clearly shown, did a rather sloppy job in 
the conversion.
I'm tempted to go with this patch; but if you prod, I could attempt
a wait-queue based patch.
