At least move it into dcache init, and consider the name cache to be a
higher-level thing. I dislike the way init/main.c is always expanded, and
I want to _stop_ everybody always addign stuff to init/main.c. It ends up
both ugly and a patch nightmare.
For example, I like how people can add filesystems without having to touch
_any_ generic files any more. Ther used to be all these things with
fs/filesystems.c etc that had to be in sync. 
I don't think init/main.c should need to care how the VFS layer does its
name cache initialization. All of this should probably be moved into
"vfs_init()", and none of this random collection of random init routines
in one long list...
