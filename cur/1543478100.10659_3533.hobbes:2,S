Are you referring to some kind of autodetection during kernel
configuration ?
I ask this because all the config options alredy have useful help that
explain the meaning of every single option and give some hints about the
choice the user should make.
The only way to automate the configuration process is some kind of
autodetection ... I am thinking at some user-level program that is capable
of detect the hardware it is running on and generate a .config file.
main() {
        ....
        detect_processor();
	detect_ide();
	detect_scsi();
	detect_audio();
        ....
        generate_config();
}
Obviously every single device supported by the kernel should be probed.
Not a short thing to code :)
And I am not sure all the devices supported by linux can be probed in user
space.
And I have never heard about something like this.
Ciao,
	Riccardo.
