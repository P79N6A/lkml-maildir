The fact that these "pausing" calls are needed in the first place seems 
rather cheesy. If there's hardware that's unable to respond to IO port 
writes as fast as possible, then surely there's a better solution than 
trying to stall the IOs by an arbitrary and hardware-dependent amount of 
time, like udelay calls, etc. Does any remotely recent hardware even 
need this?
