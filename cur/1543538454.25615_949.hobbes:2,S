Subject: 2.2.17pre10 pauses fixed by Andrea's VM-global-patch-1

While running the "brutal" (-- Alan Cox) Cerberus test suite on a
2.2.17pre10 kernel, we've been seeing pauses of from five to twenty
seconds every two minutes or so.  As best I can tell from SysReq, when
the kernel pauses, it's spending time in shrink_mmap().  When pauses
occur, free RAM is down to about 1M; but it's not a true OOM, since
there's always lots of free swap space.  (Cerberus scales its memory
usage to avoid filling swap.)
Good News: The pauses are *almost* completely gone after applying
Andrea's patch entitled "VM-global-patch-1".  The kernel still pauses,
but only very occasionally, and for no more than two to four seconds;
and even during the pauses, interactive performance is reasonable.
According to Jason Collins, creator of Cerberus, it's at least as good
as any previous 2.2.x when subjected to a Cerberus attack.
Thanks, Andrea!
PS: Anyone who wants to stress the VM, I recommend trying Cerberus
    as part of your testing mix.  Get it from SourceForge:
