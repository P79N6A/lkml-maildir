I seem to recall reading here that xmms attempts to grab
SCHED_RR if possible.  If that is indeed the case, I suspect
that the above suggestion to run xmms as root does not let the
user exploit the strength of EBS.  Since, as I understand it,
EBS affects SCHED_NORMAL processes not SCHED_RR processes.
