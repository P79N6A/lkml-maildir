Subject: [PATCH v1 7/8] Make drop_caches flush pending dput()s and iput()s
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/16/510

When doing echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches, we wish to free up as much inode
and dentry slab as possible.  This path is updated to flush any pending iputs
and dputs once the shrinkers are called.
