Hi,
Can someone explain me what is happening here?
kernel 2.2.14 SMP:
Jan 25 01:03:45 localhost kernel:

48k init)

These are similarly configured kernels. kernel code + data got smaller which is
good. init
is bigger but it doesn't matter. What's up with the ~ 4 MB of reserved memory?
Does it make
sense or not? For what is it reserved?
