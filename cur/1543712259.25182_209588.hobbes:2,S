I have mandrake 10.0, kernel-2.6.3-7mdk on my desktop Athlon XP2700+ system 
and on my IBM Thinkpad 1412 (celeron 366).  The distro/kernel works fine on 
the desktop but on the Thinkpad, the system clock is flying at about 3x 
normal speed.  I upgraded from the default install kernel-2.6.3-4mdk in the 
hopes that the upgrade would fix my system clock problem.  It didn't.  
On my laptop I had to slow the keyboard repeat rate WAY down to make typing 
possible.  Later, I noticed that timed events were happening way too soon.  
Checking my clock, I can see the seconds tick away at about 3 system 
seconds/real second.  Both with and without ntpd running (and properly 
configured) the clock runs away.  I have checked and the system properly 
identifies the CPU as a celeron 366, so the clock rate isn't "real" or coming 
from the bios.  I cannot change the clock in bios in any case.
I saw in the kernel archives that this problem was brought up with regards to 
a 2.4.x kernel (and there was also mention of a 2.5.x test kernel with the 
same results).
Can anyone shed light on this problem?  Better yet, is there a fix?
