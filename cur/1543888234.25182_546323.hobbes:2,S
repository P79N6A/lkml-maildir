It is a feature bitfield read directly from the CPU.

The CPU will still report that flag. Might speed up the boot, not sure.

No, cause those are marketing names, not reported by the CPU. You can only
lookup family, model and stepping with the vendors data sheets to get a
first impression of the possible chip.
Some chip cores get reconfigured by the vendor depending on QA (if it is not
able to cleanly process at high speed it gets sold as a slower chip).

Google for model and stepping.
