It's also handy when there are redundant routers attached to each ethernet
segment.  You get load balancing by having the routers compete for leaf-nodes
using subnet proxy ARP replies, and if a router dies, it stops responding
to proxy ARP requests and simply disappears from the routing picture.  It's
much easier to configure and maintain than a whole lot of routing daemons on
each and every single client.
A certain large corporation I used to work for used _nothing_ but proxy
ARP on its internal networks for routing (with a real routing protocol
between the routers themselves).  "Large" means ~800 machines per subnet.
