about how to turn it into a complete function call / jump.
[ i came back to this point from the end of the mail, where you consider

  it is not moot not then by all means i'm happy to further debate it. ]

enabling a feature does not mean it's actually used by most users!
For example, Fedora currently enables:
   CONFIG_NETPOLL=y
but only a tiny, tiny minority of users actually make use of it. Then 
why is it still enabled? Because it has little to zero overhead to have 
it enabled but not utilized. In the fastpath it has zero overhead. (and 
yes, i originally designed and implemented netpoll/netconsole to be like 
that, and i intentionally shaped it to be zero-overhead because i knew 
it would be used as a debug feature.)
the same goes for tracing. We want to have it enabled in distros, but 
only if it's near zero-cost. But because tracing wants to be there in 
every fastpath, we have to work /hard/ to achieve this desired 
end-result. I am "in your way" unfortunately /precisely/ because tracing 
we want to enable in Fedora, but we want to pay as little cycles for it 
on 99.998% of the Fedora boxes that wont be using any tracing at all.

sorry, but as Alan mentioned it before, this leads to "death by a 
million cuts". See above to understand what kind of feature is 
acceptable to a distro (and hence to the upstream kernel) and what not.

this is easy to solve, for example via the use of freeze_processes() and 
thaw_processes().

i dont consider polymorphic code a problem at all. Java JITs (and the 
dot-NET runtime) are faced with it every day and they have no problem 
_dynamically rewriting high-performance code all the time_. In fact, in 
the kernel we have /more/ tools to solve such problems. We can disable 
interrupts, we can flush caches, we can send IRQs, we have total control 
over every task in the system, etc., etc.
Furthermore, it is even more of a side issue in our case because unlike 
Java JITs, for us the polymorphic code is in the /absolute slowpath/. We 
could even turn off all caches while doing the code patching and nobody 
would notice. (but such drastic measures are not needed at all)
