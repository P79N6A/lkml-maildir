Excellent point.  I have used the N+1 trick for some decades, so perhaps
it is time to retire it anyway.  ;-)

Hmmm...  "char *[]" says "array of strings" to me, while char[][] seems
more opaque.  Might be just me, though.

Yeah, the "*" of the comment has to line up with the leading quote of
the following strings.  I bumped everything over a space's worth, so
that each line now has a leading tab.

It also allows bursts.  printk_ratelimit() seems to be designed to
prevent log overflow due to excessive error rates.  In contrast I want
to print stats at a more-or-less regular interval, and I don't want
to incur the overhead of gathering and formatting stats if they aren't
going to print.

Excellent point!  How about the following:

It probably won't be obvious to me six months from now.  :-/
How about the following?
	smp_read_barrier_depends(); barrier(); /* rmb() on Alpha for idx. */
I was tempted to use rcu_dereference() here and rcu_assign_pointer() above,
but I was afraid that confusion would result.

Since this is the only use of that function, I left it inline and added
a "Use rcu_boost_dat element least recently the destination for task
blocking in RCU read-side critical sections" to rcu_rbd_boosting()'s
comment header.

Nice try!  ;-)
The problem is that the tasks on a given queue might migrate to some other
CPU before they do their rcu_read_unlock().  We already have per-CPU boost
queues, but their purpose is to promote cache locality in the (hopefully)
common case where the task's block time is short enough that it runs on
the same CPU.  Should also reduce memory contention should there be a
flurry of blocks on many CPUs from within RCU read-side critical sections.
But locking is still required, sad to say!
Unless I am misunderstanding your suggestion, in which case please
enlighten me.

Good catch!  I chose KERN_ALERT, but please let me know if one of the

Thank you again for the careful and thorough review!!!
I will test these changes and send out an update.
