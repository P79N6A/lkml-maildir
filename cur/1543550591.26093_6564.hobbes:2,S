None of these can sleep. netif_*_queue routines are quite simple.
They are all atomic so there is no need to protect them with locks.

It is not clear from the example above if it is needed to lock in
the timer routine and what is locked inside. Anyway be careful
about locking regions shared between interrupts/bottom halves and
user context as this happens often.
