btw., while we have everyone on the phone and talking ;) Technologically 
it would save us a whole lot of trouble in Linux if 'external' 
hypervisors could standardize around a single ABI - such as VMI. Is 
there any deep reason why Xen couldnt use VMI to talk to Linux? I 
suspect a range of VMI vectors could be set aside for Xen's dom0 (and 
other) APIs that have no current VMI equivalent - if there's broad 
agreement on the current 60+ base VMI vectors that center around basic 
x86 CPU capabilities - which make up the largest portion of our 
paravirtualization complexity. Pipe dream?
there are already 5 major hypervisors we are going to support (in 
alphabetical order):
 - KVM
 - lguest
 - Windows
 - VMWare
 - Xen
the QA matrix is gonna be a _mess_. Okay, lguest and KVM is special 
because both the client and the server side is in the same source code, 
so the ABI [if any] is alot easier to manage. That still leaves another 
three...
