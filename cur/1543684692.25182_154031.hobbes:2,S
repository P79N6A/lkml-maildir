There are already various people testing LTP. It would 
be better if you could test what you would normally do
(e.g. data base loads or whatever) because the "real world
coverage" is a bit more lacking.

If you want to test LTP better concentrate less on
the standard functional runs, but more on the stress tests
to test your particular drivers etc. Often they have
to be invoked manually.
