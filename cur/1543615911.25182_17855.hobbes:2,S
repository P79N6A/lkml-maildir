And what would you replace /proc/scsi/ with ?
Neither of the two you mention have viable alternatives. (yet)
The only time I'd consider sysctl(2) over poking /proc/sys entries
would possibly be on an embedded system with no /proc/sys. And even then,
I'd rather try and justify having /proc. ISTR viro proposing to split
proc/sys out to sysctlfs at some point, which would solve this dilemma
nicely.
