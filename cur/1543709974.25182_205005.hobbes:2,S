4) make ac_uid and ac_gid 32 bits and move them into the place formerly
   occupied by ac_pad[10]. Establish comatibility fields ac_uid16 and
   ac_gid16 in the old places of ac_uid/ac/gid. Introduce a magic (or not,
   since checking for (ac_uid16==ac_uid && ac_gid16==ac_gid) will reveal
   whether 32bit uids are supported).
   Best of all worlds: old tools will keep working. Just recompiling them
   will yield 32 bit uid/gid support. New tools can detect whether 32 bit
   uid/gid are supported or not.
   Problem is, ac_pad[10] doesn't provide enough space for two aligned
   32 bit numbers _and_ a magic in ac_pad[10], which is the last byte of
   struct acct. If we put in only the two 32 bit numbers, we've lost the
   ability to establish a magic _in a prominent place_ for smooth 
   transitions in the future.
   We might, however, put the magic into the implicit padding of ac_flag
   (ugly, since this would require an arch dependant definition of stuct 
   acct), or put it into the uppermost three bits of ac_flag itself
   (7 seven incompatible changes to struct acct should suffice in the
   foreseeable future, but new flags would need to go into a different 
   field, breaking source compatibility with userspace acct code on 
   different archs, i.e. GNU acct tools).
I've posted a patch for 3) already. I'd be happy to go with 4) if we 
decide to reserve the remaining bits in ac_flag for a version number.
If any source incompatible change is foreseeable in the 2.7 timeframe, 
I'd prefer to stick with 3) though.

Yeah, we might want a larger comp_t not only for times, but also for
ac_io. Unfortunately, the layout of comp_t is hard-coded into GNU acct,
so no way of keeping source code compatibility (other than uncompressed 64
bit fields).
Worse, I have to revoke my previous statement of GNU acct being able to
read 34 bits comp_t values. Yes, it stores the into a double, but it
uses a long as temporary variable. Sigh.
So a new patch is due anyways. Any further comments for that?
What to do about comp_t in 2.7?
