If the drives support UDMA 2, then the controller will
operate in UDMA 2. In that case, the IDENTIFY
information will show UDMA 2 for UDMA mode selected
and UDMA 2 for UDMA mode supported.
Now, say that I have a drive that supports UDMA 6 and
the controller supports UDMA 5. Then, from the
IDENTIFY information, the UDMA selected would be UDMA
5 while the UDMA supported would be UDMA 6.
Thanks
