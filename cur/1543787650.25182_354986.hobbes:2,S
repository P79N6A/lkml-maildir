I concede this may have been the response in the past.  Its not, now.

Then don't use it at all.  Write a block driver, if you really feel we 
need two SCSI cores.

This is a misrepresentation.  -We- understand the stuff you have posted.
But you continue to demonstrate that you simply do not understand the 
existing SCSI core code.
The SAS transport class supports commonality across all SAS 
implementations.  This includes both MPT and Adaptec 94xx.
SAS transport class + libsas supports software implementations of SAS, 
including transport layer management.  This includes Adaptec 94xx but 
NOT MPT.
