Subject: [PATCH 0/25] Sysfs cleanups & tagged directory support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patchset applies on top of the last round of
sysfs cleanups that Tejun sent out on the 2nd.
My target with this patchset is to support sysfs directories
with a tag on struct sysfs_dirent making them visible only
on selected mounts of sysfs.
After going around and around the different possibilities I
believe I have finally found something that works and is
reasonably maintainable.   I believe I have achieved that
with only introducing some extra complexity in a few very localized
places.
The worst part is the code to support multiple superblocks and thus
multiple dentry tress for sysfs.  I had allocate a linked list in
sysfs_move_dir for all of the possible dentries I would need to call
d_move on. Bleh.  It works, it is correct and it is an atomic
rename.
