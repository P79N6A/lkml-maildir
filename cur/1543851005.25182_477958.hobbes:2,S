Maybe just was copy, pasted and pushed one tab over from the same check
above the loop.  What about consolidating that one?

Partitions are not limited to live within a device.  So
we should range check after partition mapping.
Note that 'maxsector' was being used for two different things.  I have
split off the second usage into 'old_sector' so that maxsector can be
still be used for it's primary usage later in the function.

Add check_bad_sector() to consolidate the checks a touch.
