I'm not so sure it's only a 'rule of thumb'. Do not know the state of
paging in just released 2.4.4, but in previuos kernel, a page that was
paged-out, reserves its place in swap even if it is paged-in again, so
once you have paged-out all your ram at least once, you can't get any
more memory, even if swap is 'empty'.
Now that macs leave out that kind of swap (MacOS classic), linux takes it.
At least macos does not allow you to set vm to less than your physical mem.
