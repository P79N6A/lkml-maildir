Sure. That's why I think this is a job for ebtables.
Note: EBtables, not IPtables. This is lower level,
dealing with raw Ethernet packets. It should be able
to mangle anything in the packet.
Just as iptables lets you change any 32-bit value in
an IP packet, ebtables should let you change any 32-bit
value in an Ethernet packet. Unlike iptables, it could
operate prior to the IP checksum verification.
Sadly, it looks like u32 mangle rules are missing.
