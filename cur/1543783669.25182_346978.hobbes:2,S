Hello lists,
(a mail for the archives)
I've posted in the past about problems with these enclosures - increasing the 
delay seems to fix it, albeit temporarily. The further you go in using the 
disk in such an enclosure, the higher the udelay() had to be - atleast that's 
what I'm seeing here (I've got two of these now :/ )
One permanent fix is adding a powered USB-hub in between the drive enclosures 
and the computer. Since I've done that, I've no longer seen any of the 
problems (i've attached the 'fault' log). Weird but true, since the drives 
come with their own powersupply.
Hope this helps anyone in the future running into the same problem.
