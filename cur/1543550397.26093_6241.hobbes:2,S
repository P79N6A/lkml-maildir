Ever heard of grep?! Pipe the ps output through grep and then to kill.
Still, it's cool you're doing real stuff with a real terminal. If more
people did, they'd realise that their source-code shouldn't have 150
chars wide lines et al.

So, let's see if I get this straight: you want us to limit PID's to
15 bits rather than 31 bits because the output of ps wouldn't look nice
otherwise?! PLEASE... Should we stick to 16 bit UID's because a simple
"ls -nal" might look ugly?! Oh, and du/df will probably start to look
ugly when having those 2 TB sized LV's. Oh my... Better return to non
LFS.

I agree with this one, though. Hoping for security just by having more
PID's is a bit naive. It might give some increased security, but having
some form of random pid-calculation will give extra overhead on fork
anyway, right?! Is it really worth it?
When you have a 31-bit PID space and people start to manufacture
programs to exploit the wraparound, you'd probably notice.

Uhmmm. Of course, DOS attacks versus such a machine isn't very
complicated anyway...
