Yes.  This caused a permenant black screen.  fbset did not give me anything
usable.  Monitor did not go into powersave.

I did, but that caused it to give a blank screen until I changed VTs.
I removed both vesafb and vga16 and recompiled to achive the result I stated
above.
I'll try 2.6.0-test2 later on today.  I did not do a make clean between
compiles.  When I compile test2, it will be clean, I never patch dirty
trees.
