I don't have any machines under any sort of real load, which may be why I
never saw a problem in 2.2.

Hmm, most of the 2.3 timeouts I saw occurred when I saturated the 10BaseT
doing a scp to another machine. Occasionally, though, it did timeout in
the absence of any considerable traffic.

That's interesting-- you probably have a different revision eepro100 than
I do, though. Mine are onboard old Intel PR440FX dual PPro motherboards.

That could likely be the case. I know nothing about the driver so I
shouldn't speculate :)

I saw the same behavior before softnet in 2.3. The network would be down
for about 10 seconds while the card reset, but there were no permanent
side effects.
