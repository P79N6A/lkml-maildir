Well, we disagree on the remedy there (I personally thing "caveat
emptor", although European law might well differ in that regard), but I
think a warning is very much called for, especially where end users are
concerned. Let's be sure those following along the LKML archives
understand something:
1). You (the end user) don't want to disable SMIs on existing systems.
2). Doing so might prevent thermal management software, system
management software, BIOS implemented fixes, and other components from
operating.
3). BIOS vendors might need to be encouraged to reduce SMI overhead.
Once systems have been designed to rely on lots of SMI overhead, the
game has already been lost. No amount of user fiddling will adequately
fix that.
What we are interested in doing with things like smi_detector is
noticing when there is substantial overhead, so that we can politely ask
the vendors involved to implement alternative SMI handlers that have
less of a hit on RT performance - the only real solution involving no
SMIs is more expensive hardware with dedicated system management/thermal
management processors.

Indeed. This is why I wrote an smi_detector that sits in kernel space
and can be reasonably sure measured discrepancies are attributable to
SMI behavior. We want to log and detect such things before RT systems
are deployed, not have users actively trying to work around SMI overhead
after the fact.
