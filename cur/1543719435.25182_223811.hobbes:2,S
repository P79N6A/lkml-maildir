I have rebuilt my kernel without preempt support and passed
"elevator=deadline" to  the kernel on reboot. I now can mount my nomad
muvo without any major problems.
However, it times out and gives the oops on attemptng to dismount, but
the only effect of that is that the USB reiterates itself and the next
time  I insert the drive, it gets bumped up (e.g. from /dev/sda1 to
/dev/sdb1).  Also, it sometimes gets rendered read-only (easily resolved
by remounting the drive with same device name).
But, during the copy process, my computer is unsually bogged down (the
jumping mouse cursor in X).
So, I am suspecting the AS Anticipatory IO scheduler at fault.
