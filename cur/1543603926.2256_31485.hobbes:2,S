Instrumentation posted here before appears to corellate fragmentation
being /caused/ with I/O activity (single bonnie process and thus a
single 8k stack frame). My own guess is that it is due to
a different persistence of various caches.
I haven't seen anyone before blaming stack frame allocation
as a /cause/ of fragmenation - I've heard people say they
notice fragmentation more as stack frame allocs start to
fail - but that's a symptom.
