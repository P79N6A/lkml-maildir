Except in this case you're not touching the book at all. If you write a 
review for a book (much better analogy methinks), then your review is 
obviously not an integral part of the book even though it's based on its 
content.

Being an integral part (as in combined or derived work) has nothing to 
do with usability. There are many other bits and pieces your executable 
needs in order to function properly (or at all) but that doesn't make 
your CPU microcode & electricity provider an integral part of the 
program, does it?
Luckily, it doesn't really matter what you or I think that 
"integral-ness" means, all it matters is how copyright law defines a 
"derivative work" and whether a cryptographic hash is such a thing. Now 
are you seriously arguing that a hash is a derivative work?

It's mere aggregation, but it's totally irrelevant because they could 
just as easily change their approach.
