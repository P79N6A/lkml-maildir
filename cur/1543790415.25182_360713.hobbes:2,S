Look at the e820 dump in your kernel bootlog.  I'll bet you'll see a
big chunk of reserved address space.  Do you have any PCI devices like
video cards that use a lot of PCI address space?
I don't know if EM64T systems (or whatever the right term is) have a
way of remapping some RAM above 4 GB so that you can use all your
memory in a case like this.
