Hmm, the script should have noticed that.  I'll need to figure out why it didn't.

Well, this is the original message's subject. :-)

Ah, okay.  I'll mark one of them as a duplicate.

Definitely.

In fact, some people don't like to get messages from the Bugzilla and asked me
directly not to put them in the CC lists in there, so I'm a bit cautious ...

Hm, I'd rather avoid sending messages with 100+ addresses in the CC list. :-)
