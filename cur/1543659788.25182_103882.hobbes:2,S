Radeonfb works better for me in 2.5.58, same card but on a
  Dell Latitude C640 - 1024x768 though, and xclk=16600.
I say "better" and not simply "works" because
  - the gpm cursor positioned on characters shows different ones
     (eg. hovering on a 'd' it shows a highlighted 'B')
  - the pre-penguin display is garbage. The console though gets
     to recover right after the penguin display
Definitely usable anyway :)
