I'll look into that next week. Sorry, I wanted to do that a long time
ago, but I spent weeks (over a month) fighting a nasty livelock
in the code. (Morale: think twice before using a spinlock inside
                      a {do .. while (read_seqretry(..))} loop)

I absolutely agree. Will do that. This should give userspace a
decently accurate and very fast time source.
