Subject: [PATCH RFP-V4 05/13] RFP prot support: disallow mprotect() on manyprots mappings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
For now we (I and Hugh) have found no agreement on which behavior to implement
here. So, at least as a stop-gap, return an error here.
