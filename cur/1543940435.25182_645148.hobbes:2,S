For all practical purposes, most memory over 3GB (or sometimes even 2GB)
on a 32-bit x86 system is treated as >4GB by the motherboard.
Because it's not the amount of *memory* that matters so much,
but rather the amount of *used address space*.  Video cards,
PCI devices, other motherboard resources etc.. can all subtract
from the available address space, leaving much less than 4GB
for your RAM.
