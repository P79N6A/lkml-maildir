Just curious, what makes you say [1] isn't hitting swap enough and [2]
is OK? The graphs are better now, by the way. Thank you.

Mainline doesn't put enough pressure on slab with highmem systems. This
creates a lot more ZONE_NORMAL pressure and that causes swapping.
Now with the 2.6 VM, you don't do any mapped memory scaning at all
while you only have a small amount of memory pressure. This means that
truely inactive mapped pages never get reclaimed.
The patches you are using do not address this. My split active list
patches should do so. Alternatively you can increase
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness, but that isn't a complete solution, and might
make things too swappy. It is a difficult beast to control.
