Subject: PREEMPT_RT: 2.6.20-rt8 patch tweaked for 2.6.20.7

Hello,
I've tweaked patch-2.6.20-rt8(*) so that it applies to 2.6.20.7
(*)

The original patch can be found here:
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/realtime-preempt/older/patch-2.6.20-rt8
http://linux.kernel.free.fr/patch-2.6.20-rt8
diff to the original patch to show what was tweaked:

New patch that applies cleanly to 2.6.20.7:

As always, if someone spots something I've done wrong,
I'd be happy to fix it in a hurry :-)
Ingo, Thomas, are there any fixes that were included in the 2.6.21-rt 
branch only that need to be back-ported to the 2.6.20-rt branch?
Regards.
