what I was intending with my origional question was a series of simple 'does it 
compile' tests that try all the config options that are affected by the patchset 
in question. the purpose being to catch simple errors like the one here where 
the patch was diffed against the wrong tree and the result doesn't compile
i.e. if the change is the the e1000 driver, try compiling a kernel with it on, 
off, and as a module
obviously such a test can't be done on the huge -rc patches (they would approach 
an exhaustive test of all config permutations), but for -stable patches (or 
better still the indivdual patches that form a -stable release)
so the first part of the question boils down to
1. Given a patch that modifies file X is it possible to know what config options 
could be affected?
and the second part would be
2. would it make sense for the LTP or one of the big compile farms to do a 
series of compiles prior to the release of a -stable kernel to catch mistakes 
like this?
