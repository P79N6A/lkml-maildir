It's because both any $(xxx) in the command will be expanded prior to
the command being executed ("command" meaning all lines in the complete
command script for the target in question - not on a line-by-line
basis).
Thus, the original $(wildcard), and also the $(shell) above are
evaluated/expanded by gmake prior to running any of the the "rm -rf",
"if_changed", and "echo" commands, and hence run before the uImage file
is created, and hence always think that it doesn't exist.
The only solution is to get the shell to do the evaluation of whether
uImage exists - that way, the evaluation is guaranteed to happen after
the uImage is (hopefully) created.
