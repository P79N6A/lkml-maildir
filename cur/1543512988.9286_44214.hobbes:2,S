Hi Ulrich,

Yes.

Yes.  Me too.
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS has the following information flow:
    public symbol information goes from foo.c to include/linux/modules/foo.ver
    then external information flows from i/l/m/foo.ver to mod_bar.o
Thus, mod_bar.o contains information from all the foo.c files all over
the kernel that define symbols.  This design is the root of the problem,
and it's why the CONFIG_MODVERSIONS section of Rules.make is such a mess
and has so many bugs.
I have some design ideas for fixing this but it's a long ways from a
usable patch.  Basically, I want the symbols in mod_bar.o to come from
information in mod_bar.c and files that mod_bar.c includes, such as
foo.h.
