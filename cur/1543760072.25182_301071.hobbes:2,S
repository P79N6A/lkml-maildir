I am trying to decode an Oops per the instructions in
Documentation/oops-tracing.txt.  The instructions say to run it through
ksymoops with the "-k /proc/ksyms" argument.
But, I do not have this file!  The closest thing I have
is /proc/kallsyms.  ksymoops complains that it does not understand the
syntax of this file.
What am I doing wrong?
