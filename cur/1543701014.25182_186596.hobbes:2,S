A quick follow-up from a discussion I've just had with Andi Kleen...
Note that I know nothing about the x86 internals of LDT/GDT/APM stuff,
so I'm clutching at straws here...
Would it be possible to switch LDT/GDT to whatever the APM BIOS expects
just before calling the APM BIOS to suspend/hibernate, and restore them
to whatever Linux requires after the APM BIOS returns from resume?
