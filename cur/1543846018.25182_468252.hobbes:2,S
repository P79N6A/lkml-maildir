Well.  We always appreciate stress-testing, thanks.  But if that finds a
bug, it's presumably a different one from this lockdep-vs-unwinder problem.
You could set CONFIG_UNWIND_INFO=n and CONFIG_STACK_UNWIND=n and reenable
lockdep.  That will a) tell us if there's some lockdep problem and b) will
give us a clearer look at any locking problems which your kernel is
detecting.
