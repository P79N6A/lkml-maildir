I've merged my patch with Andreas' one, you can grab it from
ftp://ultra.linux.cz/OS/Linux/Local/linux-2.3.40-pre6-siginfo.patch.gz
I had to remove a few more things and as aj's patch is changing the layout
of kernel siginfo on i386, I had to modify the copy_siginfo_to_user routine
(well, simplify it).
Enjoy.
Cheers,
