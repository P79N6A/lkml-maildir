Rik and Richard,
As you see, I in good faith prior to this holy war, had initiated a formal
request include a new protocol into the Linux kernel prior to the freeze.
The extention was requested to insure the product was of the highest
quality and not limited with excessive erratium as the ratification of the
IETF modified, postponed, and delayed ; regardless of reason.
Obviously, PyX had (has) on its schedule to product a high quality target
which is transport independent on each side of the protocol.  We are not
sure of this position because of the uncertain nature of the basic usages
of headers and export_symbols.

I can't see an iscsi initiator needing to touch core code anyway. Its
just another (slightly demented) scsi adapter
