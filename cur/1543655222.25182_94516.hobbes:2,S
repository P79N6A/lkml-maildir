The reason I sent the patch is because I ran into a case where the return
value _should_ be zero -- on a machine with very little memory (1MB), the
page wait-queue hash-table ends up having only one bucket (it has 256 pages,
and the code tries to make a wait-queue for every 256 pages....).  The 0 is
returned by the `wait_table_bits' function in mm/page_alloc.c.
I suppose an alternative in this case is to special-case above calculation to
peg the minimum at 1.
