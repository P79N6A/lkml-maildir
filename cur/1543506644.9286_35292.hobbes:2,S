I think the isdn coded itself is quite isolated from the rest of the kernel so 
i think the isdn4linux guys should know which CVS snapshot is stable enough
to put in the kernel even before 2.4.
BUT: I see the problem that over the past years everybody (including me)
got used to just "get-current-cvs-snapshot-and-move-into-kernel-and-hope-it-
will-compile" strategy. So will most of the "more-kernel-oriented" persons
do even if the isdn code is in the kernel, that means that there will no
"big user base" to help debug the code.
BTW: While also thinking on the ISDN past, present and future and
more and more think a fork (its GPL - do what you like) will do
only good to the development as it did for the gcc.
