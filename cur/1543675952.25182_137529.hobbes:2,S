Yes, this could be a better way to tackle hlfsd issues.

You are right. But our idea is to provide an option to disable/enable
caching based on the nature of intended application.
With this, Linux will have enhanced flexibility in NFS client like other
operating systems. For example.
1. Solaris provides dynamically tunable parameter "nfs_do_symlink_cache"
for enabling/disabling symlink caching.
2. UNIX and IRIX provide 'symttl' mount option for enabling/disabling
symbolic link content caching in NFS client.
Kindly let me know your comments.

Vivek
