Have you tried the latest tulip drivers from www.scyld.com/network?  I've found
them to be best for the 2.2 series.
That said, there is still a race condition in the current driver that can cause
the tx queue to hang, but it's highly unlikely that you'll hit it at home (have
to be doing significant traffic in both directions to make it likely that you'll
hit it).
