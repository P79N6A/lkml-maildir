I wanted to check if very carefully (Sis 655). DMA seems to be enabled
for HDD. But still there are some problems OR with 2.4.21 at all (I
quess something wrong generally in IDE support) OR still with Sis
driver. Why ? It seems, that DMA is NOT enabled for DVD and CDRW. I hear
it - they work very slow. Also hdparm shows errors, when get info about
them. In attachments examples.
Also there are some problems with Silicon Image driver (see
"DriveReadySeekCompleteError" in syslog). Because of it rather there is
problem with 2.4.21.
What can be done with it ? (both with enabling DMA for non HDD devices
and errors). If any of developers need something, please tell me.
Pozdrowienia/Best Regards
