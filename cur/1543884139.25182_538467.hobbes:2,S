Yes, some of these styles are too personal and subjective to even try
and standardize. And then often even the same person doesn't follow a
single convention across his own code. More likely you'd succeed
standardizing *religion* than this ...

Actually, I'm not sure if we really gain much by finding consensus for
this particular stuff. Most compound conditions only contain upto 3-4
operators/expressions, so most of the styles discussed here would be
almost equally readable. And any code that goes beyond 3-4
operators/expressions is probably ugly in many other ways and needs to
fix its logic.
