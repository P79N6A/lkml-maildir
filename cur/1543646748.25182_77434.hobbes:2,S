Subject: 2.5.40 boot problem on 440GX w/dual P2 processors

	When I try to boot 2.5.40 on a 440GX with dual Pentium II
processors, I got an infinite loop that continually printed "APIC
error on CPU1: 08(08)".  The same boots 2.5.34 OK (well, with a kernel
crash about every three hours, but it runs 2.5.31 without problems).
This is an SMP kernel with CONFIG_PREEMPT.  I expect to look into the
problem further if it still occurs in 2.5.41, but thought I ought to
report it in the meantime.
	By the way, here is the lspci from the machine:
