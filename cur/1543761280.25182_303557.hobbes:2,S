OK, thanks ;-)

You're spot on, we get no info.  That's why there's a bunch of kludges
around, mostly called early_printk.  But most people use x86 and they
get console output sufficiently early anyway because they know their
serial port is at 0x3f8 ...
I just realised that with CON_BOOT, we could actually get rid of the
__con_initcall loop in tty_io.c and let all the horrible early serial
console stuff disappear.
This console stuff really needs a dedicated maintainer ... wonder if
we can find a sucker ...

to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
