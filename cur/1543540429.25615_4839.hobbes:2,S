Does this mean that automount has to be rebuilt for every kernel?  And that
we should be running /lib/modules/`uname -r`/sbin/automount.
It's sounds like it's an awful lot like a loadable module in how tightly
it's tied to the kernel.  And how a kernel change can break things
horribly.  How you have to be built against the one you're going to run
against and not the one glibc was built against.
