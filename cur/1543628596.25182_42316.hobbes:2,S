I had a similar oops loading ide-cd module, without ide-scsi or similar.
EIP is the same, but since loading the module freezes the system, I do not
have a complite oops.
The system il a PentiumIII 512 MB ram,with i810 chipset.
Unfortunatelly all the other test systems I have right now are scsi based
even for the cd reader, so I cannot test on other chipset.
