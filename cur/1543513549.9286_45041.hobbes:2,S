The Linux Hardware Database (LhD) is just such an effort, only it is
distribution-neutral.  (The theory being that if the community benefits
from not fragmenting the kernel, it also makes sense not to fragment the
information about the kernel (i.e. driver and compatibility info)).
Everything is organized by product record, with user reports and
workarounds attached to the product record in a many-one relationship.
Driver information, when known, is also provided, so that basic product
information, calculated ratings, user reports/ratings/workarounds,
relevant resources and driver information are all available at a glance.
This site has been up for several months now, and we are getting ready to
release interface improvements (green-on-black will no longer be the only
color choice), more product data and hopefully announce some partnerships
with other Linux sites.  Of course, the most important thing is user
contributions -- driver info, product info, ratings and workarounds,
etc.  So please go in, register, rate your hardware, add drivers and so
on!  If there are people who are interested in working on the site itself,
we would be interested in talking to you about possible opportunities.
This is the way to do it -- in the long run, silly email to linux-kernel
and searching dejaNews should be replaced with a simple search in LhD when
trying to decide what to buy or figure out what driver to use.
