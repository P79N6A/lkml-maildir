I think ndiswrapper is a great hack from a technical point-of-view.  But
yes, I also do not think it is a violation of the GPLv2 for the same
reasons you do.

I have no objection to reverting that patch to have nidiswrapper access
to those symbols, especially as that is really the only way they will be
able to control USB devices (as you state, doing a network driver in
userspace doesn't really make sense.)
