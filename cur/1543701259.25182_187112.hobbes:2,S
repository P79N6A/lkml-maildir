This contradicts what I was told previously by another subscriber to
this list.
If it is true, then it would appear that the answer to my question "Is
it save to ignore UDMA BadCRC errors?" is "Yes."  If all transfers are
checksummed, and if all transfers with bad checksums will be retried
by the kernel, then occasional checksum errors are harmless because
they will be retried.  Do you agree?
Thanks,
