This is possibly the worst comparison I've read in a long long time...
It's rather a case of:
Consider a book.  The book is GPLed.  You take add one chapter to the
book.  The resulting book needs to be GPLed.
Now, instead of adding to that book, you "export" parts of the book by
copying them into your book.  Your new book wouldn't work without the
copied parts.  Your resulting book needs to be GPLed.
Your "read the book"-case is only comparable to the case of building
a userspace binary for local use that only uses existing interfaces,
vs building one that uses exported private interfaces.  In both cases,
since you're not distributing your modified version, you're free to
do whatever you like.
