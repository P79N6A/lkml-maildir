Dylan,
It looks like you're using an H45 technologies USB->IDE adapter (or equiv).
At least, that's the exact same vendor/product that i've got on mine.
This doesn't work with any 2.4 kernel right now.  There's no
information for this device in drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h
There's been some work on the usb-storage.c file, which may help
out once it's completed.
in the mean time, you can add these lines to
drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h
manually, and get a little closer to using this.  (I'm going to use this
interface with my MSN companion. w00t!)
This is from memory, but around line 90, add:
UNUSUAL_DEV( 0x04ce, 0x0002, 0x0200, 0x0260,
	"ScanLogic", 
	"H45/ScanLogic USB-IDE",
	US_SC_SCSI, US_PR_BULK, NULL, US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY),
