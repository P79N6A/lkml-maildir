I'm fine with whatever we decide is acceptable coding style, and changing the tool to 
match is work I'm willing to do.  If we decide declaring multiple variables on one line is 
bad, except if they are named i,j, or k then that's fine.  If we decide declaring 22 
variables per line is OK but 23 per line is bad then I'm fine with that.
If a check doesn't complain about bad code hundreds of times for every 1 time it complains 
about good code we will fix the check or remove the check entirely.
Andy already removed the multiple variable declaration per line check for the next version 
for that reason, it complained about arguably good code too often (to be fair many would 
say int i, j; is bad code).  Someday when we get the check fixed to handle sane multiple 
variable declarations better I'd like to add the check back in so the insane multiple 
variable declarations gets warned.
