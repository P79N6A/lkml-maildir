Hi,
Anyone have a good Specification for IDE Tape drives and the Linux Kernel?
I've had a problem with the ide_tape module and I am going to have to
track the problem myself.
The tape drive in use is an HP T-20 IDE tape drive connected to the
IDE interface.
Please Reply to and copy my email address, I'm not a member of this list.
Thanks,
James Kosin
