   OK, more than one actual node per device (i.e. per major:minor
pair) may not necessarily be required, but in devfs there are, for
example device nodes created in /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/device0/lun0/...
etc, and links to those device nodes created in /dev/discs/disc0/...
It can occasionally be useful to have the two distinct namespaces
available.

   If it doesn't do it when I want it to do that, I'll send you the
patch. :)
