subtle, while writing and testing that code the buffercache was not
sharing the physical address space yet, so it was stable, then it kept to
work somehow till today because only metadata writes into holes would
trigger it.

agreed. rd_blkdev_pagecache_IO will as well do:
			err = 0;
			kmap(page);
			ramdisk_updatepage(page);
			kunmap(page);
			unlock = 1;
