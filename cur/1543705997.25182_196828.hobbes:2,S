To clarify:
For out-of-tree 3rd party drivers, there are two or three
"compatibility" packages which are used to allow a single driver
source to work with many kernel versions.  (I wrote one, it is used
for quite a few private drivers.  This method works well.  See
also "kcompat").
For drivers in the kernel tree, or drivers that somone would like to
go into the tree, "compatibility" headers are never used.  API changes
are for good reasons; drivers need to be updated to follow them.
When the kernel APIs change, for minor changes and sometimes even
major ones, the author of the API change will often go through all the
in tree drivers making the necessary changes.
