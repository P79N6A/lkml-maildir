The 32bitclients option?  In my testing, it didn't change a thing.
Interestingly, unlike the original bug report, I can't reproduce the bug
on all systems, but once it's triggered, I can reliably reproduce it.  On
one 2.4.2 system, one directory always fails to show up, on another, I
can't reproduce the bug in any directory.  Sometimes no files end up
missing, 1 file is missing, or 5-6 files are missing when doing a `ls *`
vs `ls`.
On 2.2.18, mounting with nfsvers=2 seems to fix the problem, on 2.4.2
mounting with nfsvers=2 makes no difference.
