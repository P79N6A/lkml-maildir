Subject: pxe booting initrd - kernel panic: No init found

I have compiled & built linux 2.4 kernel, then I
created initrd image using mkinitrd.
Then I mounted this initrd, injected /bin/sh & libc
libraries from system into initrd.
I copied newly built vmlinuz & initrd images to pxe
servert tftp directory.
When I pxe boot my bare-metal machine with these
vmlinuz & initrd , I receive "kernel panic: No Init
found"
After adding debug messages into linux kernel
(init/main.c) I found that execve("/bin/sh"..) is
returning error & errno is EIO (I/O error)
I could see that root filesystem is mounted
successfully.
What causes this error?
Is my initrd is not successfully mounted into ram
using ramdisk image?
