Can you elaborate? What are the issues? I've found the broadcomm driver
to be more robust than the in-kernel one for acenic cards. With acenic,
I've had a null-pointer deref on SMP and other lockups where I wasn't
lucky enough to get an oops.
Also, broadcomm-driven cards can be put in a bridge. An acenic/bridge
combination will crash the kernel hard when tcp traverses the bridge.

that would be oh-so-nice. Do you need cards to play with? I've got a
couple of 3com broadcomm-chipset cards I prabably won't be needing.
