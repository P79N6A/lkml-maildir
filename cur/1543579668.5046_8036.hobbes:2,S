I think that the distinction is moot and this argument a waste of
time.  If you are anything more than a code tourist, you should have
no trouble dealing with mnemonic names.  So the above can become:
/*
 * timcaefn == this is my clear and easy function name
 */
void timcaefn (void);
If you're at all concerned about RSI, your fingers will thank you.
