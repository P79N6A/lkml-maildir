If there's any test and/or anything else I can do to help tracking
down what exactly causes the problem, just let me know. I've already
done many cpu+memory intensive tests(in Linux for example a tbench
with 256 threads and various kernel compilations) to see if the mce
appears during normal working time of the cpus, but nothing happened.
As I've already said in this thread, the mce appears only at a
particular moment after reboot. So I have exactly 1 mce log after
every reboot, always at [  301.7320xx] and with mce=nobootlog no mce
gets logged. Windows Vista never gave me the BSOD, not even while
taking all the tests of 3D Mark Vantage(yes, even if I'm a grown up, I
still like VGs). The fact that windows never crashed should mean that
the mce was never triggered on that OS, could that be somewhat related
to the other problem I talked about here, i.e. that I cannot reboot on
Linux and I'm forced to halt the system everytime I want to reboot,
while on windows I don't have any similar problem?
