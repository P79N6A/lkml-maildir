What people like you don't understand is, that there no such thing as
a "illegal proprietary kernel module" according to the GPL.
There is only an "illegal distribution of a proprietary binary kernel
module with the linux kernel" under the GPL.
If Andres' customers are happy with getting a binary only module for
use with their kernel, there is no violation of the GPL by Andre.

                         module loaded and happy about it.  And
                         completely within the boundaries of the
                         GPL. No matter what RMS says).
