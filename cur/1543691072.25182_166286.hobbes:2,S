I could run a simpler compile filter, one compile that counts and
prints all the errors and warnings, on these extra platforms.  Did you
have any specific platform in mind?  40x give me 'walnut' and 8xx gives
me 'rpx-lite' if I do 'make defconfig' followed by 'make oldconfig' where
I set the main platform (to 40x or 8xx) and accept all the default
options.
