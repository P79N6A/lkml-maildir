With a NETWORK namespace what I implemented was that you get a empty
namespace with a loopback interface.
But setting up the namespace from the inside is clearly the sane thing
todo.

Actually I think I can setup a PID space in a syscall as well.
It is a little odd that your session, and process group change but since
I was keeping 2 pids on the PID space leader I could easily do it.
The fact that getpid() would start returning 1 might be confusing to a some
processes though so clone seems to be the natural time to do it.

Sounds reasonable.  We make the decision on a case by case base whatever
make sense for the patch and the namespace.
The only real advantage to clone is you can create a bunch of namespaces
all in one shot.  Of course that makes sys_clone a little slower.
