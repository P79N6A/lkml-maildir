And to get this right: that fact that the "other"  parts  are  LGPLed
does  not  mean  that  the  RTAI team wants to keep it secret Cor put
restritctions on use - on contrary, we want  to  provide  RTAI  users
ADDITIONAL freedom - the freedom of the decision if they want to make
their application code GPLed or not.
