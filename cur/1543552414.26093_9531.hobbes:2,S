You should be able to set it on a per-process basis (via an ENV var.)

syslogd isn't the blocker.  The syslog functions in glibc being called by
named are the problem.  Stop named from blocking on syslog writes and the
world will be happy again.  I've gotta ask what kind of "load" can cause
this to happen.
And for the record, syslogd shouldn't be doing DNS lookups for things
arriving via /dev/log -- that's always the local machine.
