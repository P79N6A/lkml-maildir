They are related, but not "related enough" ! It's exactly why LinuxThreads are
so slow :-(( `Any thread in the process can do the equivalent of waitpid for
any other thread in the process.  Linux doesn't allow that; you can only wait
for a task that you yourself spawned (unless you are init).  The workaround is
to make all the threads children of the "manager".  It waits for them and
passes back exit statuses to the threads calling pthread_join.'
BTW talking about threads and "process clusters": Java allows you to have
hierarchy of ThreadGroups. So any thread can be member of few. IMO this can
be easily supported by clone() model if usage of process groups will be
extended so you'll be able to add process in process group and you'll be able
to have process as member of TWO (or more!) process groups. Then POSIX threads
can be emulated with easy and even more complex Java model will work without
big userspace kludges...

Why we can not use the same numbers for pid's and process group id's ? Then
we can use the same kill call without any modifications in interface...

If one process can become member of few "process clusters" then you just can not
call result "process" and former process "thread": it will be really confusing
to have few processes with the same threads inside !

It's religious question ...

They are [almost] sufficient. Small modifications for kernel are needed but
most work must be done in userspace.
