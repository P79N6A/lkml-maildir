Almost, #3 would actually be "get lvalue", as now.
The only problem is that a quick audit of 2.5.75 reveals 16 places in
generic code where set/get primitives would work without jumping
through hoops, out of 43.
New idea:
Provide cpu_local_inc(var)/cpu_local_dec(var) and __cpu_local_inc(var)
and __cpu_local_dec(var).  Generic implementation:
  /* This is local.h */
  typedef atomic_t local_t;
  #define local_inc(l) atomic_inc(l)
  #define local_dec(l) atomic_dec(l)
  /* l is a per-cpu local_t.  Increment it atomically. */
  #define cpu_local_inc(l) local_inc(&__get_cpu_var(l))
  #define cpu_local_dec(l) local_dec(&__get_cpu_var(l))
  /* Increment non-atomically (must have preempt disabled) */
  #define __cpu_local_inc(l) \
	atomic_set(&__get_cpu_var(l), atomic_read(&__get_cpu_var(l)) + 1)
  #define __cpu_local_dec(l) \
	atomic_set(&__get_cpu_var(l), atomic_read(&__get_cpu_var(l)) - 1)
This catches one common case for ia64 to use the magic pinned area,
and also allows x86 to use its incl/decl instructions, which both
networking stats and module refcounts have wanted for a while.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
