Yes, the list is configured as subscriber only, I make sure I add people to the accept filter as soon as they hit the list. 
Fell behind a bit yesterday so apologies for the inconvenience this caused you Satyam.
Rationale is it keeps the SPAM down quite a bit but I acknowledge it has it drawbacks if I don't get to the held messages quickly.
Cheers,
Hugh
