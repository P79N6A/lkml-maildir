I do things like this regularly, and have been using kernels 2.4.10+ on
many types of boxen, but have yet to see this behavior. I've done this
same type of test with 16k blocks up to 10M, and not had this problem I
usually do test with regard to I/O on SCSI, but have tested on IDE,
since we use many IDE systems for developers. I found though, that using
something like LVM, and overwhelming it, causes bdflush to go crazy. I
can hit the wall you refer to then.When bdflushd is too busy...it does
in fact seem to *lock* the system, but of course..it's just bdflush
doing it's thing. If I modify the bdflush params..this causes things to
work just fine, at least, useable.
