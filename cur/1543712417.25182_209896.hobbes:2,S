The driver doesn't know how fast the drive is either.
Without timing the drive, interface, and for different request sizes,
neither the block layer _nor_ the driver know a suitable size.

But the driver doesn't have _any_ knowledge of what the I/O scheduler
wants.  1MB requests may be a cut-off above which there is negligable
throughput gain for SATA, but those requests may be _far_ too large
for a low-latency I/O scheduling requirement.
If we have a high-level latency scheduling constraint that userspace
should be able to issue a read and get the result within 50ms, or that
the average latency for reads should be <500ms, how does the SATA
driver limiting requests to 1MB help?  It depends on the attached drive.
The fundamental problem here is that neither the driver nor the block
layer have all the information needed to select optimal or maximum
request sizes.  That can only be found by timing the device, perhaps
every time a request is made, and adjusting the I/O scheduling and
request splitting parameters according to that timing and high-level
latency requirements.
From that point of view, the generic block layer is exactly the right
place to determine those parameters, because the calculation is not
device-specific.
