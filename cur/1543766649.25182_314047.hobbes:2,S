Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Misc driver core changes (constness)

Hi,
It all started when code like this:
static const char driver_name = "blah";
static struct device_driver {
	.name = driver_name,
};
would give me compiler warning about removing constness because driver
core has "name" fields drclared simply as "char *". I think it is a good
idea to have them as "const char *" since whoever accesses them should
not try to change them.
01-hotplug-use-kobject-name.patch
  - kobject_hotplug should use kobject_name() instead of
    accessing kobj->name directly since for objects with
    long names it can contain garbage.
02-sysfs-link-constness.patch
  - make sysfs_{create|remove}_link to take const char * name.
03-kobject-const-name.patch
  - make kobject's name const char * since users should not
    attempt to change it (except by calling kobject_rename).
04-kset-name-const.patch
  - change name() method in kset_hiotplug_ops return const char *
    since users shoudl not try to modify returned data.
05-driver-const-name.patch
  - change driver's, bus's, class's and platform device's names
    to be const char * so one can use const char *drv_name = "asdfg";
    when initializing structures.
    Also kill couple of whitespaces.
Please consider for inclusion.
