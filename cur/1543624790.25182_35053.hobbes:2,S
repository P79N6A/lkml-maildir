   	There is no problem with MD5 that makes it unsuitable for this
   particular application. A SHA signature would enlarge each packet,
   further reducing the effective MTU. This would increase the cost of
   what was intended to be a simple mechanism to solve a specific
   problem (spoofed SYNs/RSTs).
Ignoring valid RST frames breaks TCP.
