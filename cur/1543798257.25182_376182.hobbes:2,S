I'm not sure what you mean by "create".  The tasklet structures are
created and initialized once in the driver probe function.  I'm not an
expert but I looked into the implementation (softirq.c) of tasklets and
found the following design:
1) Tasklets are run by a softirq.
2) A softirq is really a kernel thread allocated on a per cpu basis.
3) A "scheduled" tasklet is simply a member of a link list maintained by
the softirq thread.
My driver implementation has the following features:
1) Uses only one kernel thread for all SPI controllers.
2) Reuses existing performance tuned kernel infrastructure (i.e.
tasklets)
3) Implements a low latency locking scheme for dispatching SPI transfers
via tasklet's serial scheduling guarantees.
IMHO, from a system load perspective, my approach is lighter and simpler
than adding a dedicated kernel thread for each SPI controller.
