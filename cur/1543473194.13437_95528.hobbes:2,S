Hi
I have installed RH5.2 on my laptop (toshiba 4010CDT) and everything
was well.
then I decided i want to compile APM into the kernel.
I've download kernel 2.1.131 (also tryed 2.1.132 and 2.1.132ac2)
configured, compiled installed, and booted. all went well
than I compiled and installed pcmcia-cs-3.0.6
after booting, linux did not respond to the keyboard
(including alt-ctrl-del and alt-sysreq-* )
so I decided to use the pcmcia modules which came with RH5.2
so I downloaded 2.0.36, compiled installed and booted.
i got somthing like:
LILO: linux-36
.............
<computer rebooted>
I tryed to disable APM in the kernel, but same situation.
if i put vga=ask on lilo boot, the computer rebooted
after it asked for a vga mode, and was answerd
any ideas ?
btw:I searched for a solution for my problen in the mailing-list
archives
but did not find one, so I'm posting it here
Thanks in advance.
