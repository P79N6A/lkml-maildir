Somewhat. The answer is "yes, but depends on usage". If you just 
write
	_Bool x = filthy_action();
	if(x)
Then the compiler is smart enough to optimize 'x' away if it is not used 
somewhere else, therefore we do not pay a price for converting the return 
type of filthy_action (=int) to a _Bool.
The asm output for storing the result of filthy_action() [requires 
'volatile int x' in this small example]
	call strxcmp
	mov [ebp-4], eax
While making that a 'volatile _Bool x' makes it:
	call strxcmp
	test eax, eax
	setnz al
	mov [ebp-1], al
Makes me prefer typedef int bool over _Bool.
