Why not just disguard this sillyness of alphabetic characters in version
numbers... Just carry through the same structure used by major/minor:
I.e.
2.0.39 < released 2.0.39
2.0.39.1.1 < first development snapshot of the kernel which will eventually
	     be 2.0.40
2.0.39.1.2 < second
2.0.39.1.n < Nth
2.0.39.2.1 < first RC
2.0.39.2.2 < second RC
2.0.39.3.1 < opps! Development went too long and we had to break feature
	     freeze to add important features.
2.0.39.4.1 < Trying to stablize again
2.0.39.4.2 < a few more bugs fixxed
2.0.40	   < Looks like 2.0.39.4.2 got it right!
