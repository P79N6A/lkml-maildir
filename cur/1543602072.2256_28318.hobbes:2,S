I don't think that this is a valid argument:
you are testing on i386 and make design decisions for the architecture
independant part.
I'd prefer ptep_get_and_clear_and_flush(), then the arch part can do
what's needed to get the final pte value. (if a single page is modified,
otherwise the arch can define a suitable mmu_gather)
