I have done exactly that.
And I gave you the URL.  You want to read it, or you want to keep whining
that "NO ONE" is doing the work I am pointing you directly to?

I've also benchmarked my Makefiles against the stock kernel Makefiles.
The "correct and simple" Makefiles run in 1/2 the time.
Honestly, it's like talking to a wall here.  Rick, you don't know what

I'm not interested in your prejudices any more.
