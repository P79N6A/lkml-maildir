No, because roughly we are on a line. The most efficient way is to do them in
inreasing order, except for one wrinkle. Two requests that are very close
together ought to be merged, since otherwise by the time we issue the command
for the second one, the disk will have spun past the sector, and we'll have to
wait for about 10ms. The merging can't be done for writes, unfortunately. Reads
are much simpler, we can just ignore the data from the sectors we don't want.
So for writes we have to ensure that the requests are some minimum distance
from each other. It's getting complicated, but we might be able to cook up
something. I sure hope its not NP.

Yeah, that idea is really weird. Why don't they just tell us that the sector
is bad and let us do the worrying? This will screw up any algorithm you use, and
implies two half disk seeks on average for every remapped sector (a bit more,
actually, if you consider that more sectors are on the outside).

Ugh! Why do these sicko's do that? I would have expected that sector 0 was on
the outside and the last sector on the inside.

Ok. Is the strat of trying to merge reads that are close together possible?
