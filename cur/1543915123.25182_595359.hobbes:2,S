On small NUMA system < 64 nodes you basically have an additional word 
added to the address_space structure. On large NUMA we may have to 
allocate very large per node arrays of up to 1024 nodes which may result 
in 128 bytes used. However, the very large systems are rare thus we want 
to do the allocation dynamically.

Hmmmm... There was an extensive discussion on that one early in the year 
and I had it in the overview of the earlier releases. Ethan: Maybe get 
that piece into the overview?

Yes. Cpuset with CONFIG_SMP=n has been run for years on IA64 with Tony 
Luck's special configurations.

A pointer has the size of BITS_PER_LONG. If we have less nodes then we 
just waste memory and processing by having a pointer there.

This is called from __set_page_dirty_nobuffers. There is no allocation 
context available at that point. If the allocation fails then we do not 
allocate a tracking structure which means that no targeted writeout occurs.

You just quoted the comment above that explains the locking requirements. 
Here it is again:
/*
