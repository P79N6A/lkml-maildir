Btw, inside patch-scripts they provide a script which rather than diffing two 
trees, calls "combinediff" (from patchutils) to merge the patches statically, 
without need of the patched files. I've been very confortable with it - 
doesn't quilt have something such?
About patchutils (quoting from Andrew Morton):
  See 
http://cyberelk.net/tim/patchutils/
 (Don't download the
  "experimental" patchutils - it seems to only have half of the
  commands in it.  Go for "stable")

Btw, I'm assuming that you didn't want to drop the HPPFS compile line in 
"externfs" (since that's not documented), right?

Yes, I saw it, a lot after writing the message (I sent it a lot after writing 
it).
However, another thing: I think that the handling of EMFILE/ENFILE (too many 
fd's for the app or for the system) should be moved inside the os_ layer. Or 
will you create yet a filehandle wrapper for functions like 
os_connect_socket() (which calls socket(), which requests an fd)? Do you 
agree or have any arguments to support the current design?
