I think I should follow up on my previous post regarding ext2fs
corruption on 2.2.3, just to clear things up a bit.
Ingo Molnar informed me that a bug was fixed in the raid-patches
that would cause exactly the warning message I described. So my
post about possible ext2fs problems in 2.2.3 should be disregarded.
Sorry for the confusion.   Guess we're back at 2.2.{9,10} issues  :)
