	Changing check_media_type to 0 (in the source as I compiled cdrom 
into the kernel) fix the problem with audio CDs, and cdtool works again, 
but mtv keeps failing, it detects the VCD and the number of tracks, but 
when trying to play the second (the big one) it is unable to determine 
its size and doesn't display anything, if you want strace output I'll 
send it to you (not to the list :-).
