Subject: [PATCH 2/5] OProfile update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/26/5

The code that attempts to reset last_task and in_kernel has a race
against samples appearing during the handling of the buffers, that
causes a small number of mis-attribution of samples. Closing the
window is non-obvious, and not worth it, so we just make it smaller.
Even without the patch, there seem to be few such "bad" samples
because its effects are mitigated on a switch into userspace or
a task switch.
