I built a new kernel with this line commented out and booted up this new
kernel. Sadly the problem remained. Trying this kernel with the
'ide0=autotune' was also unsuccessful. For the curious, the kernel gets
to the point where the drive partitions are examined and then things go
splat. A sample of the messages ...
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma_status == 0x20
hda: (__ide_dma_test_irq) called while not waiting
hda: drive not ready for command
hda: lost interrupt
Things limp along as the partitions on the hda drive are gradually
printed out, but there is one change in the kernel messages
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma_status == 0x21
I'll try modifing the ali15x3 driver with the patch you sent and see how
that goes.
