Just as an Information - I see the same problem here, with an ubuntu 2.6.22 
kernel. I did not report it so far, as I couldnt reliably reproduce it with 
an upstream kernel.
Just as an additional datapoint (Lenovo T60 here).
For me it happens only when using battery. Thats another reason I havent 
reported it so far - it only happened while on the road with work to do. 
If there is any testing needed - just say it.
Greetings, 
Andres
