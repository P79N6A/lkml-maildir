Looks nice.  A detailed scheme might be:
1) ctime/atime for each radixtree node(or, cluser of pages)
It seems to be a good accuracy/overhead compromise.
And is perfect for the most common case of sequential accesses.
struct radix_tree_node {
+        unsigned long ctime, atime;
} 
radix_tree_node_alloc()
{
+        node->ctime = some_virtual_time();
}
radix_tree_lookup_slot()
{
+        node->atime = some_virtual_time();
}
2) eviction-time for each recently evicted page
Store eviction-time _in place_ in the slot that used to store the
page's address, with minimal space/time impact.
+#define SLOT_IS_EVICTION_TIME  1
radix_tree_delete()
{
-                pathp->node->slots[pathp->offset] = NULL;
+                pathp->node->slots[pathp->offset] =
+                                 some_virtual_time() | SLOT_IS_EVICTION_TIME;
}
