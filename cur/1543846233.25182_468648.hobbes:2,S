Thanks - good observation.
I see the same thing here.  The 2.6.18-mm2-broken-out.tar.bz2 I downloaded from
  
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.18/2.6.18-mm2/2.6.18-mm2-broken-out.tar.bz2
has a file named broken-out/usb-hubc-build-fix.patch, but the broken out directory
  
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.18/2.6.18-mm2/broken-out/
does not have such a file.
