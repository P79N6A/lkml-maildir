I'm trying to once again locate the slram patch for Linux 2.2.11.
I have 96M of RAM in my machine and only 64M is cached.  Talk
about SLOW!!!!  I searched freshmeat, and many linux kernel patch
sites, and most sites I found are all 2.0.x related or otherwise
completely obsolete.
Please send me the URL for the homepage of the slram patch,
and/or an ftp site, or email addresses of the authors.
TIA
TTYL
