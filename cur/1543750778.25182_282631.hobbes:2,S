The formatting of this makes it hard to follow the logic.  The "<< 8"
operation isn't aligned with the nesting parenthesis and at first I
thought there was an ambiguous order of operation "|" vs "<<".
How about the following:

 }
 
 void adm1026_print_gpio(struct i2c_client *client)
Also, on a completely "I don't know what the hell I'm talking about" point,
it seems odd that for values named "0_3" and "4_7" you would upshift the
"4_7" value 8 bits instead of 4, but it could be just a bad choice of
variable names.
Cheers, Andreas
