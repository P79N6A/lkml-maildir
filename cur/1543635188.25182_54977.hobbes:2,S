I need to get some USB devices that work in Linux!

I agree.  It looks like vfs_unlink() provides all of the protection 
that is needed.  No BKL, no more i_sem uses.  I'm asking Al Viro about 
driverfs_get_inode().  It looks like it will be safe and correct to 
use i_sem there, but stay tuned, it may not be necessary at all.
