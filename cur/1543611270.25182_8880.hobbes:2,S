Seperate "works" from "supported by". Putting a driver in the kernel makes a
lot of sense, but you'd still probably have an officially supported version.

They have to open source it anyway, since it is based on the sbus aurora
driver as they said, so its already GPL code.
There is a difference between releasing GPL code and supporting it. Standard
Red Hat support contracts for example stop at the point you go compiling
your own kernel.
