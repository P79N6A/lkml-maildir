I wrote the comment in scsi_obsolete.
IIRC,
* you must call scsi_done() for every command you receive exactly once
_except_ for the scsi_reset(SYNC)-command itself [i.e. for the structure
passed into scsi_reset()]. If there are any other pending commands in
your queue when you receive a scsi_reset(), then you must call
scsi_done(DID_RESET) for each of them.
* You should not call scsi_done() at all for scsi_reset(SYNC). If you do
it anyway, then nothing will happen :>
Note that the SYNC_RESET-flag in scsi_done() is part of the scsi-command
structure, it is not a host adapter wide setting (The comment is
misleading).
Btw, this is the "old" error handling, I know nothing about the new
error handling (use_new_eh_code==1)
