Yeah, that that's no help.  Sorry, debugging the legacy MPS
code is where I draw the line:-)  I guess if you want to compare
with and without ACPI you have to go all the way down to
UP/PIC mode,  (maxcpus=1 noapic, with and with out acpi=off)
but unless that fails with acpi and works without, we may
not be able to tell much about the failure from it.
thanks
