Hi Anton
              So you are constructing a improved NTFS file driver. So when you
have to check your written codes of file driver, will u recompile the whole
kernel ? . That is what I am asking. I am in a way to build a new file system.
I took NTFS as a sample one. I thought , I will first try to compile and make
it run. 
Thanks in advance

No, it is not possible to not recompile the kernel if NTFS was configured. 
You might see some very strange effects if you try... What is your problem? 
Just recompile the kernel. Remember NTFS should be used read-only as write 
support is broken.
I have a much improved NTFS driver but my Sourceforge linux-NTFS CVS is 
down (for a week now!) so I can't release it at the moment. )-:
