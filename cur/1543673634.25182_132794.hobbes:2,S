I agree.

Good idea.  Of course, a policy that only encrypts the secret stuff may
have an impact on security, but it makes sense to let the user decide on a
policy.

And just like mlock(), only root will be able to call it.

Thats a good question.  I see three options:
1. Dump the core plaintext.  (sucks but convenient for users).
2. In the core, zero the pages that would be encrypted when swapped out.
   On some policies where only things like keys are encrypted, the core
   will be usable.  On others it won't.  (Not sure its really an option).
3. If the core contains pages that should be encrypted, dump it encrypted
   with some system-wide (or per-uid) key generated on the first core
   dump.  The key will be available to the user via some /proc interface.
   Its up to the user to be smart and take the core to another host and
   decrypt_core(1) it there (or just decrypt_core(1) it to an encrypted
   filesystem).  In any case, the decrypted core or the system-wide key
   are never written to disk.
4. Refuse to dump core of a process that has pages that should be
   encrypted.
Do you see more options ?
Anyway, it should probably be policy controlled.

I'm not familiar with this core either and somehow got the same feeling
when I looked into it :)

Probably at process initialization during fork.  The key must be ready
before the process gets its first chance to allocated pages that may be
swapped out.
