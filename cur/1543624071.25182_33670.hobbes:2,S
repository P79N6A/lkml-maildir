This is why version control has to go into a standard filesystem as a 
standard filesystem feature that every user uses.  When version control 
costs $8k per seat, only a tiny few can afford it.  I sure can't, and I 
am a professional programmer.  Version control has to become just 
another expected filesystem feature, and one that is so transparent to 
users that Mom uses it without fear.  Reiser4 will have transactions 
built-in, and the natural technical progression from there is version 
control and branching.  I want to see the number of version control 
users equal to 90% of the number of ReiserFS users in three years (not 
Linux 2.6 but Linux 2.8 or later).  If that happens, then open source 
can economically support the core version control features, and $8k 
pay-for-use plugin suites and utilities from folks like Larry can supply 
those expensive to write tweaks that wealthy software management types 
want.  
I think that if version control becomes as simple as turning on a plugin 
for a directory or file, and then adding a little to the end of a 
filename to see and list the old versions, Mom can use it.
Besides, version control is useful for distributed filesystem designs 
(high-performance distributed parallel writes work better with version 
control in use.)
That said, Larry, a big thanks for making Bitkeeper free for use, an 
even bigger thanks for getting Linus to use it, and I hope you get at 
least a fraction of the money that you deserve from selling Bitkeeper.
Now I just have to finish shoving it down my developer's throats....:-/ 
 Version control system adoption is always a lot of effort for 
management, and CVS was an enormous hassle to get them to use also....
