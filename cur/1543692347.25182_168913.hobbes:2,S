Subject: [PATCH] make O=foo does not fail if foo does not exist

Simple enough... I mistyped the path to the object directory, and the 
build continued in the source directory anyway. This patch causes the 
build to stop, although with a non-obvious error message. A better fix 
would actually check KBUILD_OUTPUT after the cd && pwd test, but I'll 
leave that to you if you're so inclined.
