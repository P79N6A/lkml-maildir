The old repostitory got killed when bkbits.net went away. There's a new
repo at
	
http://sparse.bkbits.net/sparse
but I don't know why the mailing list would have gone.

It may well be up-to-date: without anybody interested enough to do a 
back-end, I had very little incentive to improve the front-end further. 
Right now all the warning messages for the kernel should be largely valid, 
but the networking code re-uses some structures for both user pointers and 
kernel pointers (which Davem agreed was bad and fixable, but wasn't done 
in time for 2.6.x), so we can't get rid of the user pointer accesses 
there..
