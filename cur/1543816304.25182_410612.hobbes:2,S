Oh well, if Greg says so...
Christopher, can you please respin a patch with C99 initializers, which
would look a bit better than your original one? I'd suggest a single,
straightforward macro (no needless underscores please):
#define LINEOP(val, port, inverted) \
    { .val = (val), .port = (port), .inverted = (inverted) }
Hopefully this will keep all lines within a reasonable length and won't
hurt the readability too much.
Also, I just noticed in your original patch: please preserve the comma
at the end of the last line of struct declarations. It's not needed,
sure, but it makes later changes easier.
Thanks,
--
