I really don't follow you objection to this.  If one is maintaining the
SDIO core then I would expect some familiarity with the spec and an
understanding the FBRs are per-function but contained in the same
CCCR/F0 register space.
Also, I would consider the start of the CCCR as the "base address".

I think this is less readable than SDIO_FBR_STD_IF(func->num).
