With the present implementation it is pretty much impossible to do
since unbind grabs bus's rwsem. That means that any driver attempting
to remove children will deadlock. Driver core is not aware of evry bus's
topology issues that's why you need a bus method to do proper locking
and children removal.

What about unbinding USB hub driver? It will hang because you can not
remove children on the same bus. In serio the core takes care of removing
any children before unbinding the driver, but again, this is bus-specific
implementation. The bus knows how to handle this.
I also have issue with doing it in steps - it will cause every device have
3 or 4 method-attributes - unbind, bind, rescan, [reconnect]. They all
implement very similar action - control link between device and driver.
I do not see the reason for splitting them apart and it will be a waste
of resources to have all of them as well.
