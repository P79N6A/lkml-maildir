Softrr ? Which patch? Davide's? Noone has tried to make them compatible 
(yet?). Even so, this may be unrelated to softrr.

Run top in batch mode as root reniced to -11 so it doesn't get preempted and 
capture it happening before you kill XEmacs. Then try running XEmacs niced 
+10 and see if it doesn't happen there. Also if it was lucky enough that you 
booted with profiling enabled you could profile it, but top will tell if it's 
a simple scheduler starvation error.
