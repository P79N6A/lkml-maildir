I've cleanly recompiled a 2.0.36 kernel and modules with symbol and module
versioning enabled. When I now try to load my own module I get the
following error message:
  couldn't find the kernel version the module was compiled for
I'm a little clueless, since I did compile the module for specifically the
version of the kernel I'm using. Turning off the versioning does not change
the behavior at all.
Any thoughts on this?
Thanks,
  Olaf
