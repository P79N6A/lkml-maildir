Readers of BUGTRAQ probably have already seen the message indicating
some of us have been seeing library problems, not fs corruption.  At
least those of us with problems specific to mailing lists may not have
been seeing the fs corruption.  A message seems to implicate
multi-line X-Keywords header lines.  Following is an excerpt from
BUGTRAQ:

X-Keywords is processed in 2 functions:
mail_filter() (in imap/src/c-client/mail.c) filters out X-Keywords line
and seems to handle multi-line keywords correctly
unix_parse() (in imap/src/osdep/unix/unix.c) probably doesn't handle
multi-line keywords
Different results (different header sizes) causes pine crash.
The same may apply to X-UID, X-Status and Status header (I haven't test,
so I'm not sure).
imap uses the same c-client library, so the same condition may cause
imap crash.
