Hello All,
I am trying to understand the differences between ramfs and ramdisk, and
also trying to use ramfs.
I am running 2.4.13-ac8.
I do a mount -t ramfs none /tmp/tmpfs
Then use dd to create a file, of size 500M.
do a df, and %Use is 49%(machine has 2G) so i guess default size of
"ramfs" fs will be half of that, 1G.
But when i delete the file. df doesnt show %Use to be 0%.
du -sk doesnt either.
Not sure what is going on.
Cant the utilization of the ramfs be changed.
Also, from fs/ramfs/inode.c
"* NOTE! This filesystem is probably most useful
 * not as a real filesystem, but as an example of
 * how virtual filesystems can be written.
"
1. Can i use ramfs for any practical purposes at all ?
2. I was hoping to create a few ram disks, mount them as swaps on Sun
   machines(so i dont have to buy their expensive memory) and run big
   simulations. (agreed might not be screaming over NFS)
Also, some articles talk about using ramfs when on a webserver. So it
ramfs mostly for read-only stuff rather than read-write.
Thanks,
Regards.
