Grep on the tree showed this:
drivers/char/serial.c:
#if defined(__i386__) && (defined(CONFIG_M386) || defined(CONFIG_M486))
#define SERIAL_INLINE
#endif
include/asm-i386/processor.h:
/* Prefetch instructions for Pentium III and AMD Athlon */
#ifdef  CONFIG_MPENTIUMIII
#define ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH
extern inline void prefetch(const void *x)
{
    __asm__ __volatile__ ("prefetchnta (%0)" : : "r"(x));
}
#elif CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW
#define ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH
#define ARCH_HAS_PREFETCHW
#define ARCH_HAS_SPINLOCK_PREFETCH
More candidates for CONFIG_X86_xxxxx.
But these spawn over other architextures:
include/asm-alpha/processor.h:#define ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH
include/asm-ppc/processor.h:#define ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH
...
