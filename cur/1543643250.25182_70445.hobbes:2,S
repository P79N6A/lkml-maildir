Well, a bridge can also just _bridge_ ARP packets between two sides of the 
bridge. The ARP module can filter out those packets. These packets will not 
pass through the ARP code of the Linux kernel. Ofcourse, the ebtables ARP 
module can be easily adjusted for arptables, I will do this later if nobody 
beats me to it... For the same reason, basic ebtables IP filtering is not 
redundant.

OK. This is to Lennert:
Could you please have a look at the ebtables patch located at
http://users.pandora.be/bart.de.schuymer/ebtables/v2.0/ebtables-v2.0_vs_2.5.34.diff
and approve the changes made to the bridging layer API? They are necessary to 
make a brouter and to deal with bogus NETFILTER_DEBUG warnings if the option 
is compiled in the kernel. Any questions will be gladly answered... Note that 
the brouting facility has been working for atleast three months and it has 
already been used in real-life situations, there's an example usage on the 
ebtables homepage. Dealing with NETFILTER_DEBUG warnings consists of setting 
nf_debug to zero when the netfilter hooks change from bridge hooks to some 
other stack's hooks and vice versa. See the patch.
