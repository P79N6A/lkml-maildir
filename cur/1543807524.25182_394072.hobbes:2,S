AFAIK you can reach these low latency factors only if multiple nodes are 
on the same motherboard. Likely Opteron specific?

I dont understand you here. What would be the benefit of selecting more 
distant memory over local? I can only imagine that this would be 
beneficial if we know that the data would be used later by other 
processes.
