I modified the patch to add fields towards the end of each line.
i.e after 'freq, passno' fields. And symlinked /etc/mtab
to /proc/mounts.
mount,df  and friends were all perfectly happy.  
I imagine your script may also be happy with the additional fields
**towards the end**. I would like to avoid one more mount interface if
we can help it.
