It is a large part of the issue though.  If you don't have one
repository file per project file with a name that resembles the
repository's one you find out that the project file name is somewhat
unimportant, just yet another of the metadata to track.

The only problem with distribution is sending as little as possible
over the network.  All the problems you're talking about exist with a
single repository as soon as you have decent branches.

A conflict, what else?  The file name is only one of the
characteristics of a file.  And BTW, the interesting problem which is
what to do when you find out two different files end up being in fact
the same one is not covered by bk (or wasn't).
