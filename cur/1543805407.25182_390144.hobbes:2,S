You can't fool me, because I looked at the cdrecord source
code and at the documented APIs for various OSes.
It's misleading to say that MacOS doesn't allow a file
descriptor. MacOS has something similar to what Linux
has, but not in the normal filesystem namespace. You
specify a name to get a handle. Of course, on MacOS,
Joerg also uses -scanbus to create nonsense.
Names can be handled by Windows, FreeBSD, MacOS X,
Linux, OpenBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, and IRIX.
That's everything that isn't end-of-lifed.
The rest of your 22 platforms are dead and dying things
that are unlikely to be upgrading to the latest software or
hardware, assuming they survived the Y2K bug. It's old
stuff like the Amiga, the NeXT, etc.
Using numbers for CD burners is like trying to send email
to the IP address of the recipient, which half-way worked
until DHCP was invented. Wait, we could have all email
clients offer a -scannet option. :-)
