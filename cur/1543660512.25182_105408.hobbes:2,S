Justin, I haven't checked, but have you deleted my change
again to include asm/io.h in aix7xxx_osm.h?
You keep doing this, I wish you'd stop :-)
More seriously, you really need to look at the build etc.
fixes people put into your driver in 2.5.x, it is rude to
keep deleting such changes over and over again.
