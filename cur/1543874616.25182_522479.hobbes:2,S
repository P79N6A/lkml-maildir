If you can't read protect your kernel, you can't write protect it either. Of course the
symmetric key would be per kernel, not a single global one.

You need to protect your kernel binary already, adding a key to that doesn't increase the
complexity or safety requirements, so all that hardware safety is already in place.
(And I'd use AES instead of TripleDES.)

Nothing stops you from signing the binaries with an asymmetric key. After checking that
signature the user can sign the binary with his private symmetric key and upload it to
the device.
