Actually, I guess the bad case wasn't "not listed at all", but incorrectly 
listed - so the probing would go to the wrong address, not find any 
devices, and then promptly result in an unusable machine with no hardware 
attached.
I _think_ (and hope) those machines were never released. But even now, on 
my main machine, I get "MCFG area at f0000000 is not E820-reserved", and 
probably the only reason the PCI layer doesn't overwrite it is because it 
does show up as a PnP region, and I have pnp support enabled.
Basically, the resource allocation for mmconf has always been broken 
(largely by *design* by Intel!). And by being broken, it has been 
unreliable.
