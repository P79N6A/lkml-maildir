Yes. That should work fine.
The restart logic sometimes results in odd calling conventions, and quite 
frankly, we could just change how "restart_block" looks too. There is 
nothing that says that it has to be
	unsigned long arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3
and that particular layout was just picked on a whim. The only issue is:
 - we don't want the restart block to be *too* large, since it's part of 
   the thread info.
 - but we need to have enough room for all the system calls that want to 
   use the restart block, and preferably in a reasonable format.
So far, using "unsigned long" has been good enough, in that it's big 
enough for a pointer and all normal arguments, but if something really 
deeply wants another format or a guaranteed 64-bit word regardless of 
architecture, we could make one or more of the arguments be "u64" instead.
But in this case, since there is already unused argument space, I think 
that doing the "32 high bits + 32 low bits" is probably the best option.
