i guess it might seem confusing.  to round the cell rate down, you need
to round the clock period up for the hardware scheduler.  so the up/down
refer to the atm rate, not the clock period which is what appears to be
computed in the following sections.
for example, in the eni driver, but comp_tx() is computing a clock
period. to round the desired cell rate down, the clock period is
rounded up.
