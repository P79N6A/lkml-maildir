	I believe that the keyspan drivers that compile GPL-incompatible
firmware into the kernel or kernel modules are illegal.  I tried
being a nice guy about it, to the point of wring a user level
firmware loader could be invoked automatically via hotplug:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=98758846106843&w=2.
You can look in the linux-usb-devel archives at about that time
for further discussion of the copyright issues.
