Subject: [PATCH: NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5.18] support for NCR voyager (3/4/5xxx series)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch adds SMP (and UP) support for voyager which is an (up to 32 way) 
SMP microchannel non-PC architecture.
There's basically nothing different from the 2.5.15 one except for merge fixes 
and changes to the tlb and process init code.
The patch is in two parts:  The i386 sub-architecture split is separated from 
the addition of the voyager components

 (148k)
(The split diff is pretty huge because it's actually moving files about).  You 
must apply the split diff before applying the voyager one.
These two patches are also available as separate bitkeeper trees (the voyager 
tree contains the arch-split tree):
