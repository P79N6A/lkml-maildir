Hi,
I have here a Dual-Athlon Box, with a AMD760MPX Chipset and AMD768 IDE.
In the base 2.4.18 kernel there seems to be no support for the
IDE-Chipset
So I tried 2.4.19-rc3-ac1 and I got more APIC errors, than I can count
:))
So my question.
Does anybody know where to find a patch for the IDE-Support to the plain
2.4.18 kernel,
or which version of the 2.4.19-rc<x>-ac<x> is stable enough at the
moment to run such a box.
TIA for any help...
