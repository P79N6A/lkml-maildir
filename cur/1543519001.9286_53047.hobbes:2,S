These changes mean that all 64-bit programs will fail during
shmctl(IPC_SET), ie all functions that change the ownership, permissions,...
We must undo that change.

I don't know what we should do here:
* if we don't change the sysctl number, then you would need kernel version
specific code on 64-bit platforms (2.[34]: write a long value; 2.2: write an
int).
* if we change the sysctl number, then you need kernel version specific code
on all platforms.
