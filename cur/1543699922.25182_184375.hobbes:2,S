This is a known problem.
The driver is marked BROKEN in the Kconfig file, and you were only able 
to choose it since you said "no" to
  Select only drivers expected to compile cleanly
.
Unless someone fixes this driver it will not be available in kernel 2.6.

Thanks for the reply - yes, I understand that the code is broken - however, unfortunately, I have one of those initio cards that needs that driver and I would like to be able to use the 2.6 series kernels. Until that driver is fixed, I'll be stuck on 2.4.x kernels.
