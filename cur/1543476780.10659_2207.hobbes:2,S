(This probably doesn't have a very high priority, as I have received zero
comments on the first patch.  The timekeeping does work much better with
this however.)
My previous patch to arch/alpha/time.c was somewhat incomplete.
timer_interrupt() logic did some updating even when no tick had passed.
do_gettimeofday() didn't account for the unused partial tick.
do_settimeofday() didn't handle any of this.
Making this work properly with SMP will require more changes.
