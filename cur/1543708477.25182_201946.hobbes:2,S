Sorry for the misunderstanding. I now tested code size with and without
the inline keyword. It's as you said: In some cases code size increases
in some cases it stays the same, in some cases size decreases. I removed
2 inline statements, this reduced the code size by 34 bytes. It's really
worth experimenting with the inline keyword.
