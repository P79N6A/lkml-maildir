My experience shows that there are only very rare occurrences of 
situations where you cannot get back into userspace to do the coredump, 
and the coredumper tries very hard never to cause additional faults.
While I am sure you could construct scenarios where this would happen, 
realistically the only one I have run into were stack overflows, and 
they can be handled by carefully setting up an alternate stack for 
signal handlers -- just make sure the entire stack is already dirtied 
before you run out of memory (or, turn of overcommitting).
