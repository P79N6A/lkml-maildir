I finally had time to give this a better look. It now seems the problem
is in the VM system.
I patched a test10-pre4 kernel with kdb, then started two "diff -ur
linux-2.4.0testX linux-2.4.0testY > log1" and two "find / -true >
log". After this I tried cat"ing" a small file. The cat never 
returned. At this point I entered kdb and did a stack trace on the "cat"
process:
schedule()
___wait_on_page()
do_generic_file_read()
generic_file_read()
sys_read()
system_call()
So it seems the process is either in a loop in ___wait_on_page()
racing for the PageLock or it never wakes-up... (I guess I could add a
printk to check which)
Unfortunately I didn't find anything obviously wrong with the code.
I hope you can do a better job tracking the problem down.
As a reminder:
i686, UP, 64Mb RAM, IDE disks, ext2.
