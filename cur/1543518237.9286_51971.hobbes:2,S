Are you sure it's problem with TTY driver ???? At least here I can use
lynx locally and remotely to see russian web sites and all russian letters
are characters above 127 without any special tuning ! Standard minicom
settings do not work with characters above 127 but it's not related to kernel
at all !

Lynx somehow doing it.

I can access it from good old patched NCSA telnet for DOS (standard NCSA
telnet does not support characters above 127 and again it's not linux kernel
problem) or from Windows's TTSSH ...

Linux (kernel) supports 8 bits just fine (starting from version 1.0.something
at least :-)... Userspace tools... It's other story :-/ But userspace
tools discussion is not for linux-kernel anyway :-)

It's not so simple. Even on console there are can be loaded fancy font
without graphic chars or with graphic chars in non-standard place (for
example KOI8-R/KOI8-U). Here in Russia usual setup is even more complicated:
-- cut --
setfont Cyr_a8x16
mapscrn koi2alt
printf "033(K"
-- cut --
due problems with graphics chars, VGA and KOI8-R encoding...
