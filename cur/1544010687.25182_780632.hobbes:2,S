Hi
I'm noticing strange behavior on my T61.
When I select performance governor  for my CPU I still get occasional
drop on CPU frequency from 2.2.GHz to 800MHz.
I'm attaching my .config file.
How it could happen that perfomance is actually able to change
frequency from it's highest mode - is it because of some overheating ?
(It usually happens when I run   make -j2 -  even just for a minute -
it suddenly start to drop the CPU to lowest clock rate -
imho I think the machine is quite calm to be 'overheated')
What other debug info is needed ?

(btw why do I have two states  - 2201000 and 2200000 ??)
