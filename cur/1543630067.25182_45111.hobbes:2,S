Does anyone know how to trace this problem to check if it's related to tdfx?
I think there are two modules for tdfx, one created for the DRI tree of X and
one created from the kernel.
I don't know which we are supposed to use.
Besides this, I believe glide3.so.xxx library interacts with this part of the
code, so it might also be a reason for the problem.
Anyone knows how to investigate this further? Does this make any sense?
Thanks,
