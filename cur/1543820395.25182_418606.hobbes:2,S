I'll start on converting 2.6.16 tomorrow, since you're anticipating it 
with such eagerness. I expect it to take some days. But a few years ago 
I did convert a filesystem in C to C++. The code was shorter, faster, 
and more robust. Fast enough to take the top position in SPEC SFS, and 
robust enough to handle the disks being pulled from under its feet 
(which a very popular Linux filesystem written in C could not at the 
time, and maybe today).
The speed benefits were largely due to algorithmic improvements, not 
language micro-optimizations; however I do claim that C++ allowed much 
faster refactoring, so we could focus our efforts on algorithms instead 
of finding our way in ever-more-convoluted error paths.
