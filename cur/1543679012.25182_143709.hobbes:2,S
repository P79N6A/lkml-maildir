In this specific case of the Tyan S2466, it has 2 64/66 slots, and 4 32/33 
slots.   The chipset is the AMD 760MPX, AMD 762 system controller, and AMD 
768 peripheral controller, and the Winbound 83627 super i/o asic.  
I thought that this chipset actually had 2 pci controllers - one for the 
64-bit slots and the other for the 32-bit.  Am I wrong?
