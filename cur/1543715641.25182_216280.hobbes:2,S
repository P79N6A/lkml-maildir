Hi Marcel,
This is wrong... What if you have several devices that are needed firmware?
You are not only loading a specific firmware but do it for a specific device.
You may also want to do something else with it...
I think until pcmcia either provides or allows to create devices on pcmcia
bus you can just fixup the name breakage like I did for atmel driver and
leave it be. The device is not registered and not used in any way except to
provide "unique" name for fimrware loader, at list in atmel_cs that is the
case.
