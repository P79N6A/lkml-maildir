I've only just found that we have to supply the __GFP_COMP flag to get
this working.  And one of the routes through snd_dma_alloc_pages goes
to sbus_alloc_consistent.  Would you be happy for me to send Andrew a
patch with sparc and sparc64 sbus_alloc_consistent including __GFP_COMP?
Ought I to do the same in the sparc and sparc64 pci_alloc_consistent??
Thanks,
Hugh
