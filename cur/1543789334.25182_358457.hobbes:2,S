x86-64 shares that code with ia64.
The patch is actually not quite correct - in theory node 0 could be too small 
to contain the full swiotlb bounce buffers.
The real fix would be to get rid of the pgdata lists and just walk the 
node_online_map on bootmem.c. The memory hotplug guys have
a patch pending for this.
