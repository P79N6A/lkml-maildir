Serge Robyns is dead on; you need 0.13 as it has the black voodoo magic to
turn on the external amp.  notice that headphones should work with 0.10 :) 
I got a patch to alan so the most recent should be in his 2.2acs, if thats
an option.
alternatively you should be able to apply Serge's patch to 0.13 off
http://people.redhat.com/zab/maestro
 and it should work.
my apologies for not keeping 2.3 fresh.
