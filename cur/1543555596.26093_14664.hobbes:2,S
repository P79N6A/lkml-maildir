Try changing the thing around a bit: make the above place say
	/* disable legacy emulation */
	pci_write_config_word (dev, USBLEGSUP, 0);
and then AFTER we have successfully done a request_irq() call, we 
can enable PCI interrupts with
	/* Enable PIRQ */
	pci_write_config_word (dev, USBLEGSUP, USBLEGSUP_DEFAULT);
Does that make it happier?
