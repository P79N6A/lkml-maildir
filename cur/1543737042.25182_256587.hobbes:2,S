 One I can test a bit has indeed ACPI enabled.

 The firmware (BIOS) reports I/O APIC interrupts correctly on this box --
there's no override for IRQ0.  Timer interrupts work correctly in the
ExtInt mode.  They only fail in the I/O APIC mode.
 Older reports from the list show exactly the same problem, e.g.  
"
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0404.1/0739.html",
 which is
probably one of the earliest references to the clock skew problem with I/O
APIC routing.  As I believe both the 8254 and 8259A and the I/O APIC are
internal to the chipset, I doubt that can be a problem specific to board
design; it may be a firmware fault, though, such as an initialization bug.  
As Ross used to maintain temporary workarounds for nforce2 problems, he
may be able to comment on what reports he received.  Ross?
