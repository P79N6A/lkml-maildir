Overall, I like it, though I yet have to scrub the details. As far as
the legacy space is concerned, I'd be as "generic" as possible and thus
provide the legacy-files on a per-bus basis. That is each pci bus could
expose those even if it's not a host bridge. It's an arch matter to
actually implement them, and by default, I suppose archs would just
treat all busses of a domain the same, but it leaves us with the
necessary flexibility for setups with bridges that can remap the legacy
space or that kind of thing.
Great work !
Ben.
