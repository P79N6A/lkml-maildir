Wittman,
I had this forwarded to me by someone else.  I haven't had time to fully
inspect the information about creating a module disk.  Enjoy.

----Modules Disk Begin----
I found the documentation and the Driver Disk Update Development Kit :
The Device Driver Disk Update Development Kit is here :
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/
especially
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/README.mod_devel_kit.html
You can download the Device Driver Update Disk Devel Kit
here : 
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/mod_devel_kit.tgz
( be careful 3.9M ! )
In this Kit, I found the "Config file" using by Redhat for his
Kernel.
