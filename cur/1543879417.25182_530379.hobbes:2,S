Yes.  Even then, last time I clocked instructions, xchg was still slower 
than read / write, although I could be misremembering.  And it's not 
totally clear that they will always be in cached state, however, and for 
SMP, we still want to drop the implicit lock in cases where the 
processor might not know they are cached exclusive, but we know there 
are no other racing users.  And there are plenty of old processors out 
there to still make it worthwhile.
