Ahhh... wait a moment you are the one who is responsible for
util-linux - wouldn't you care to take a bunch of patches?!

/etc/vfstab, /etc/mtab -  are conceptually just fine.
No need to inevent here. No need to do the book keeping in kernel.
passwd doesn't need /proc/users too and many people just forget that
we are still on a UNIX like system.
The only case which deserves special treatment is the parition
