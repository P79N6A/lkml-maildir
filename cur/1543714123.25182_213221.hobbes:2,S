Thanks a lot, Martin, this seems pretty important.
So, i_shared_sem, as you supposed.
Do you still have the two profiles input to diffprofile?
I wonder if they'd have clues to help us understand it better.
Any chance of you doing the same comparison between 2.6.5-aa5 
2.6.5-aa5 minus prio-tree?  (Well, needn't be -aa5, whatever comes to
hand.  Looks like "patch -p1 -R < prio-tree" mostly works, just some
rejects in mm/mmap.c itself, let me know if I can help out on that.)
If -aa is okay, I hope so, then it's surely some stupidity from me.
We're not at all surprised that vma linking and unlinking should take
rather longer; but the rise in __down, __wake_up, finish_task_switch
is horrifying.  Or is that how it usually looks, when a semaphore is
well contended - thundering herd?
