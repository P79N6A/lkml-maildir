Greetings,
I have experienced 3 kernel freezes on 2.6.0-test11 this far, within a few
days. I don't know how to reproduce them.
Today's freeze just happened, at uptime 2days, 4 hours, 23minutes
(informations from gkrellm, which stopped refreshing them after the
crash).
I have had a look in system logs, and could find no message of interest
(no special message was issued to syslog apart from exim checking its
queue).
When freeze occurs : I have no control whatsoever on the system : both
keyboard and mouse are without effect. The machine cannot be reached
(ping, ssh) through the network. The screen output is totally blocked
(gkrellm displays stop scrolling, too).
The only solution I have found to this is a hard reboot. I have also
noticed that everytime this freeze occured, the CPU fan was turning (and
kept turning after the freeze). (This is a laptop).
At the time of the crash I was doing nothing but browsing with Galeon, and
playing an mp3 on xmms.
I am running a non-patched 2.6.0-test11, and don't run any "exotic" or
"non-standard" service (ssh, exim, portmap, nfs client running).
It may be possible that a hardware problem be the source of this problem -
if you tell me it can help, I can run on 2.4.23 for some time and see if
the freeze still occurs.
This machine has no special load, it compiles new kernels and other
softwares without problems ; these freezes are quite mysterious to me.
Please Cc: me in replies, as I am not subscribed to this ML.

Below are technical informations.
I run a Debian sid (unstable) system, as up-to-date as can be.
