Sigh...  I guess I'm to blame here - I should've warned you when you had sent
the first mail.  My apologies.  Situation with quota:
	* variant in the tree is obsolete and needs resync with Jan (quota
maintainer)
	* threading old (== in-tree) quota is counterproductive - it will need
to be done from scratch after merge _and_ it will only make merge harder.
	* said merge ( basically, split of delta into edible pieces and
feeding them to Linus) won't be trivial - patch is large.
	* if you are willing to do that - great, coordinate this stuff with
Jan and go ahead.  I'd be glad to help if there are any troubles.
