Well, we had implemented this in one of the previous -rt versions for
the high resolution timers. It was a bit hacky and I did not come around
to reimplement it on top of ktimers. This is only a problem for itimers
and posix interval timers at the moment. The nanosleep variants do not
suffer from this problem as the wakeup happens directly from the hr
timer interrupt. That way we have only one instead of two task switches.
