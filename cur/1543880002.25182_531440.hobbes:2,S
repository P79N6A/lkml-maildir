Progress as in progress on Ingo's scheduler. I still don't know how we'd
decide when to replace the mainline scheduler or with what.
I don't think we can say Ingo's is better than the alternatives, can we?
If there is some kind of bakeoff, then I'd like one of Con's designs to
be involved, and mine, and Peter's...
Maybe the progress is that more key people are becoming open to the idea
of changing the scheduler.
