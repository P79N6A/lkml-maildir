Just one question: what makes you think that I need Redhat-whatever to
tell an ignorant luser WTF he is? FYI: I've done that _way_ before not
only RH but Linux appeared. I see no reason to treat you any better than
I treated VMS duhvelopers who had no clue on UNIX but insisted that
they could "write for VAX".
BTW, if you will grep the /usr/src/linux/MAINTAINERS you will not find
me there. In the code - yes, but not there. And if you can show me a
single email where I said that I "own" any part of code - go ahead and
do it. Put up or shut up. Yes, I know many things. No, I'm fucking not
obliged to do the helldesk work for any fscking NW primadonna with no
shred of clue, no desire to learn and no semblance of taste. Told you
so, and did that before involvement with RH.
FWIC you are a spoiled ignorant brat with ego on steroids. And I've dealt
with your ilk since waaay back. Shitty attitude? Bite me. I'm a BOFH, not
a nurse. Comes with profession.

<shrug> So? If I'll need to summon Cthulhu - reading your already published
crap aloud will work just as well.
HTH. HAND. FOAD. *PLONK*
