Since it is bulk, it is not guaranteed to start before the control
message anyway, so it should be safe.
The patch looks correct to me, but I would still like to increase
KP_RETRIES a bit. If I read the code correctly, the current setup allows
for 10 seconds between usb connect and acknowledging the control
message. This is enough if the device is only connected when booted
(which is the normal use case). However, in our case, we do
software-initiated reboots of the ipaq while it is attached to the usb
bus, which can take much longer, so for us KP_RETRIES should be at least
1000, maybe 2000. Of course, we can always run a patched kernel for this.
I'll test the patch later today.
Anyway, we have not seen the usb_serial_disconnect bug since applying
your patch, so that bug is also probably gone (we have had nearly 1000
successfull connects/disconnects since then)
