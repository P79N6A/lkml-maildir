The sk_buff solution does look attractive,
particularly for high data rates.
It does seem to carry serious overhead (in relation
to ring buffers) for devices with small FIFOs.
At 115200bps, I saw the 16550 driver accumulate
~8 bytes per interrupt. Using 2 sk_buffs per interrupt
means 256 sk_buff allocations to push 1KiB (71ms) of data
to the line discipline. This amounts to ~3600 sk_buff
allocations per second at 115200bps.
