Create /dev/input/ and add event0 and event1 nodes. You'll have to hack
the init scripts to do this and fight off udev.
or
Download and copy this to the device:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/temp/udev_071-r5_armv5te.ipk
and ipkg install udev_071-r5_armv5te.ipk
I'm not sure these kind of things should be going to LKML in future
though...
