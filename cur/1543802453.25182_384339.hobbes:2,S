Development is definately finished. The maintenance of the stable tree 
at this point should be done to fix critical problems.
So, its accepting patches, but only for critical problems/real bugs.

Definately - the community has concentrated efforts on the v2.6 tree
for more than 3, 4 years.
linux-2.6.14/drivers/net/Kconfig has the exact same text: 
    If you have a PCI NE2000 card however, say N here and Y to "PCI
    NE2000 support", above. If you have a NE2000 card and are running on
    an MCA system (a bus system used on some IBM PS/2 computers and
    laptops), say N here and Y to "NE/2 (ne2000 MCA version) support",
    below.
Send a patch :)
