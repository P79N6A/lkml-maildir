Not "more" clients, OTHER clients. They're exclusive.
The NMI watchdog simply happens to be the default client, but it
needs to unregister itself before any other client can take over
the performance counters and the local APIC's LVTPC entry.
(And that's what happens today.)
If the device model handles hierarchical dependencies correctly,
there should be no need to hardcode calls from the local APIC's
PM routines to whoever happens to be its current sub-client.
(And if it doesn't do this correctly, please fix the device
model first before migrating apic.c/nmi.c to it.)

Good.

Agreed, but existing PM users do work. Most are leaves in the
dependency tree (e.g. sound cards). The only one I know of that
isn't is apic.c, and it has a local workaround as you noted.
Given that we're supposed to be in a feature freeze getting 2.5
into some kind of 2.6-worthy shape soonish, I think PM should
be hooked into the device model as a legacy API.
