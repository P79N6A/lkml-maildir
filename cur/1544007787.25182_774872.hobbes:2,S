crap, I actually meant to move that out to the actual do_fcntl() call to
get it out of my way.  I did see that it is useless since we don't
handle responses in any way and obviously this has nothing to do with
dnotify.....
I'll poke the cifs people to see if they are ok with dropping it
altogether properly....
