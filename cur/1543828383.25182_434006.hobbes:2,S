hm, that would be yet another calibration loop with the potential to be 
wrong (and which would slow down the bootup process). If loops_per_jiffy 
is wrong then our timings are toast anyway.
I think increasing the timeout to 60 secs ought to be enough - 1 sec was 
a bit too close to valid delays and i can imagine really high loads 
causing 1 sec delays (especially if something like SysRq-T is holding 
the tasklist_lock for long).
The write_trylock + __delay in the loop is not a problem or a bug, as 
the trylock will at most _increase_ the delay - and our goal is to not 
have a false positive, not to be absolutely accurate about the 
measurement here.
