There is also the old kernel_thread based method that should probably be 
compared, especially if pre-created threads are thrown into the mix.  Also, 
since the old days, a lot of thread scaling issues have been fixed that 
could even make userland threads more viable.

Priorities cannot be shared, as they have to adapt to the per-request 
priority when we get down to the nitty gitty of POSIX AIO, as otherwise 
realtime issues like keepalive transmits will be handled incorrectly.
