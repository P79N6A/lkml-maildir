Not yet, as I don't have anything compatible to drop in, and right at
the moment also can't afford to buy any such.

Unfortunately, the only processors I can borrow from friends at the
moment are not compatible with my motherboard, otherwise I'd do
precicely that...

I wouldn't be surprised, but if it's not the processor, it's something
else on the motherboard as I've swapped everything other than those
two already without any change in behaviour...
Best wishes from Riley.
