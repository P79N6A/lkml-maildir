I haven't tried the delack-timer patch yet, but I'll see if I can load 
2.2.15pre7 today.  I don't know if this is related or not, but one thing I 
found that has made my webservers much more stable was to change apache to 
MaxRequestsPerChild  0 so it wouldn't do so much child creation and killing 
off.  I found that on a moderately loaded server, if I set 
MaxRequestsPerChild  1000, the server would lock up completely in a couple 
days but with MaxRequestsPerChild  0 the server would be stable for a 
couple weeks.  Any comments?
