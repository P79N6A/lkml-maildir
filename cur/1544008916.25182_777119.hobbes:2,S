In the past, the integrity hooks were discussed with the 
LSM/security community, and others expressed interest in using 
them, and we were trying to accommodate their requests. On the 
other hand, we have separately asked them to chime in here to
defend these hooks, and have heard nothing. As everyone has
pointed out, if no one uses them, they are bloat, and if
someone else wants them in the future, they can easily be
added back. In a little more detail:

These hooks were for alternate integrity modules, and since
no one else has defended them, we have to agree that they
should be replaced with direct calls.

These hooks were for potential use by LSM modules to inquire about the
integrity of files, and for other modules to be able to anchor data
in the TPM list. Again, since no one has chimed in to defend the 
hooks, we have no problem removing them.
Sorry about arguing too long on this, and thanks for all the reviews...
