I have heard over-and-over again by the M$ trained groupies how
M$ is so much better than Linux. This lie exists with any closed-
source. Sun used to say much the same thing until they got smart
and learned from Linux, then actively supported it because it
makes their machines run better.
M$ actually stated several years ago, they they didn't need to use
spin-locks in SMP machines because they invented a special mechanism which
nobody else can use. This means that M$ will always be "superior" because
it doesn't need to use "inferior" spin-locks. I think the "invention" was
to used the second CPU as a heater.
The lies go on.
