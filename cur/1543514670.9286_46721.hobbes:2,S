I don't think that works.  Look:
main code	interrupt
set k0 to zero
load A from addr
store B at addr
		set k0 to zero
		load B from addr
		store C at addr
		return (i assume this makes k0 non-zero)
k0 is non-zero, so loop again
load C from addr
store B at addr
And you've lost the original A.  I came up with a similar scheme while
taking a long walk today (many people seem to prefer the shower for their
good ideas.  I find Japanese stroll gardens are ideal, and a nice long
walk is almost as good.)
The idea is to flag whether we're in the middle of an xchg operation in
a register such as k0, then have the interrupt handler's exit routine fix
it up:
move k0, one
lw A, addr
sw B. addr
move k0, zero
would then be the typical non-interrupted case.
The modified interrupt code looks like:
int xchging = (k0 == 1);
... normal irq code ...
if (!xchging)
	return;
if (instruction we will return to is a store)
	return to addr - 4;
return;
This should work, and have a minimal cost per interrupt.
Now to find out whether we have a suitable register on PA-RISC..
