Assuming this really gives a benefit on several benchmarks then we need 
to think about how to do this some more. Its a rather strange form of 
locking.
Basically you lock the page with a single atomic operation that sets 
PageLocked and retrieves the page flags. Then we shovel the page state 
around a couple of functions in a register and finally store the page 
state back which at the same time unlocks the page. So two memory 
references with one of them being atomic with none in between. We have 
nothing that can do something like that right now.
