Not quite.  This maybe the way it operates, but it is called "block"
for a reason.

Now, just because James suggested implementing the SMP service as a block
device you think this is the right thing to do?
How about this: Why not as a char device?
At least MS isn't suffering from the "no to specs" syndrome which
the Linux community seems to be suffering...
SMP as a Block device????
You need to see the history of SMP and its intended use.

This is very similar to the binary attr file "smp_portal" in
drivers/scsi/sas/sas_expander.c, bottom of file.

Exactly! SMP. (binary attr file)
