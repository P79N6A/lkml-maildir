Read my last mail on this thread... A single flag saying "we can fail
easily" does not sound good to me.
Imagine people changing the point where the 
	if ((gfp_mask & __GFP_FAIL))
		return;
check is done (inside the freeing routines).
I would like to have a _defined_ meaning for a "fail easily" allocation,
and a simple unique __GFP_FAIL flag can't give us that IMO.
