Nicely spotted.

Do you pass arguments in registers, instead of stack?
Are you sure the variable 'bailout_addr' does not belong to a page
that has been paged-out, at the time the signal-handler is invoked?
If your application just exits, you don't need to catch the signal,
you don't need the signal at all.
If is tries to do something useful, it has to be sure it won't cause 
any other page-fault, or will make things just worse.
Unless the kernel starts sending signals when swap utilization exceeds
75%.

You may start a GC() which does not need to know where you were when
you received the signal. Problem is that the GC() has little space
to run itself.
