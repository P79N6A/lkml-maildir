Sure.
In the third case (ie. transition to S4) we are supposed to do the following:
(1) Upon entering the sleep state, which IMO can be done _after_ the image
    has been saved:
  * figure out which devices can wake up
  * put devices into low power states (wake-up devices are placed in the Dx
    states compatible with the wake capability, the others are powered off)
  * execute the _PTS global control method
  * switch off the nonlocal CPUs (eg. nonboot CPUs on x86)
  * execute the _GTS global control method
  * set the GPE enable registers corresponding to the wake-up devices)
  * make the platform enter S4 (there's a well defined procedure for that)
  I think that this should be done by the image-saving kernel.
(2) Upon start-up (by which I mean what happens after the user has pressed
    the power button or something like that):
  * check if the image is present (and valid) _without_ enabling ACPI (we don't
    do that now, but I see no reason for not doing it in the new framework)
  * if the image is present (and valid), load it
  * turn on ACPI (unless already turned on by the BIOS, that is)
  * execute the _BFS global control method
  * execute the _WAK global control method
  * continue
  Here, the first two things should be done by the image-loading kernel, but
  the remaining operations have to be carried out by the restored kernel.
In the remaining two cases we generally don't need to bother with the global
ACPI handling.

No, I think the image-saving kernel should suspend.  Then, on resume the
platform will go back to it and it will jump back to the hibernated kernel.

That's correct, but ...

... we can't return to the hibernated kernel unless we are going to cancel the
hibernation.
That's why I think that for the suspend-to-both the image-saving kernel will
need to support the same set of devices as the hibernated kernel.
