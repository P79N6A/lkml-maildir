You are right, there are 27 files.

True, most plain directories don't need an event (and usually don't have
one today), because the kset does not match, like the "holders/slaves"
directories, or the "glue directories" between bus and class devices. 
But for example the bus/class directories, there we really want an
uevent (and have one today) to set bus specific defaults when the
bus/class gets created.
Thanks,
