Hi Kernel-Mailing-List
I habe a Notebook 'Fujitsu Liteline Celeron 400 DVD' on which
I can't get the BogoMIPS which a Celeron 400 Processor should have
according to the BOGOMIPS-HOWTO.
According to the Howto it should get around 400 Bogomips, but (see below)
it ist getting only around 98. The whole System also seems to be somewhat
slow; compiling a kernel takes on this machine half an hour.
I'm using Kernel 2.2.12 optimized for PPRO/6x86MX on a Suse 6.1 system,
but I also tried other Kernel versions and optimisation for Pentium and
586. 
mtrr is enabled, multi-processing is disabled.
In the Bios-setup-utility I'm having L1 and L2 cache enabled.
I'm no expert, but I tried around a bit and I'm always getting the same
results.
Does anybody have an idea what could be the reason for this? What
settings could be wrong? Is it a hardware-bug? Or how could I find
out what's wrong? 
cheers
Peter
