Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the ethernet driver
disables the interrupts for a too long time, it just means that the
computer is only servicing the network interrupts at that time, and
since the mouse interrupt does have a lower priority, it's serviced
not very often and with huge delays.
In such a case the network driver should either use interrupt mitigation
if the cards supports it (reading many packets per one interrupt) or
switch to a polled mode.
