The good news reader might be a problem. In fact, I'm currently looking
for one. Criteria:
 - GUI with support for X clipboard (not just selections)
 - Ability to bounce to myself
I use Pan, but it cannot bounce articles. It only saves them, so I have
to find them (it uses Message-ID for name), open in vi, add "From xxx"
on top, then do the "Import External mbox" dance in my mailreader.
In previous Pan the useful trick was to "print" article, and specfy
your lpr to be a scrip which called sendmail. But they took it away.
