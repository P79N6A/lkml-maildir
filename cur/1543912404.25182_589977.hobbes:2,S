Hi,
with NFS3, there is this 'root hole', i.e. any person who has a root 
account (perhaps by use of a laptop) can mount an export (let's say this 
export had the "root_squash" option), and still have a look at the user 
files, because he can locally setuid() into another user.
So I was looking for alternatives. CIFS is my favorite candidate, but it 
has a few issues right now. So does sshfs and about everything I have 
come across. Since I remember NFS4 can use KRB5 authentification, my 
question is, will the NFS(4) server process run with an fsuid equal to 
the user that authenticated?
thanks,
	Jan
