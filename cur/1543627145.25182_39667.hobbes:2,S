The current patch forks the message to evlog inside the printk
function.  This thread is proposing that the printk function be
wrapped inside a macro so you could easily capture 
file/funcname/lineno of the calling function along with the
original printk message
(plus the other stuff stored in the evlog record header).

This would be done in user-space, not in the kernel.  This is on
our enhancements list for event logging.
