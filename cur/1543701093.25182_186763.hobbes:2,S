Recently I activated my BCM4401 network card on my notebook, 
using the b44 module, to do some large file transfers 
(normally I use my wireless connection).
While copying around several MB between 2 computers I noticed something
very strange.
Scp'ing a file FROM the notebook TO my gateway, I got a throughput of
1.2MB. This looks normal, since the gateway is a very old machine.
--------
The problems started when copying a file in the opposite direction
(FROM the gateway TO the notebook).
As soon as I started the process, the following error messages started
appearing in my syslog.
	b44: eth0: Link is down.
	b44: eth0: Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex.
	b44: eth0: Flow control is on for TX and on for RX.
	b44: eth0: Link is down.
	b44: eth0: Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex.
	b44: eth0: Flow control is on for TX and on for RX.
	b44: eth0: Link is down.
	b44: eth0: Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex.
	b44: eth0: Flow control is on for TX and on for RX.
	b44: eth0: Link is down.
After a few seconds the whole transfer -stalled--.
The Link just went down and up and the messages filled my syslog.
For me it looks like that something is seriously wrong on the RX side,
since sending a file works without a problem.
