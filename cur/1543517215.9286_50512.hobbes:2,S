I wanted to look at the state of NAT so I got the latest devel
and using 'make xconfig' compiled in Network packet filters (replaces
ipchains)
and Network packet filtering debugging.
When I boot I get an error saying I do not have ip_always_defrag and
cannot control
packet filtering.
I cannot for the life of me find the option Always Defrag.
Has something changed that I cannot see, I have looked through the docs
but
cannot see mention of anything
Kind regards
Kevin
