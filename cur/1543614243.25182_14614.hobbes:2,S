Disaster is the word that comes to mind when I think about the last
initramfs patch I looked at (be it several months ago)

Initrd Dynamic already supports multiple tar.gz archives. If I thought
their was a need I could support uncompressed tar's with a few small
changes.
I've patched GRUB to support loading the mutiple images. It would also
be supported in syslinux, if you choose to implement it. Months
ago when I asked you to implement it, you told me the idea was
stupid.  : P   I will never let you forget this myopia. : >
