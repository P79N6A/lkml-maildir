It is like that by design.  The devices are suspened before we create the
system image (so that they do not get in the way) and we should wake
up some of them afterwards so that we can write the image to the swap
partition.  Currently, we wake up all devices, which is not very efficient,
but it is simple enough to allow us to hunt bugs more easily.  Finally, the
system is just powered off.
Greets,
Rafael
