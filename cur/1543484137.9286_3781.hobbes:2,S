Out of pure bordom at work, I stumbled upon
Ctrl-Scroll lock, and Shift-Scroll lock.
For those of you who aren't aware of what they do.
At console, without being logged in, you can hit either key combo.
Ctrl-scroll shows you all processes running, their pids, their child
processes, and any sibling processes, and stack info and such.
shift-scroll shows you memory, and swap info.
Is there a way to disable this feature at compile time, or would I have to
edit source somewhere? I dont like the ctrl-scroll feature. I like how it
logs to kernel log, but I wish it would log the same info, instead it just
does
Feb  3 13:20:59 pm3-01 kernel: Total network buffer allocations   : 37970547 
Feb  3 13:20:59 pm3-01 kernel: Total failed network buffer allocs : 0 
Feb  3 13:20:59 pm3-01 kernel: Total free while locked events     : 1624 
Feb  3 13:20:59 pm3-01 kernel: IP fragment buffer size            : 0 
Things of that nature. Anyhow. Anyone to remove it from happening?
It is also a potential DoS, if someone walked by one of my machines, and
just put a couple weights on the ctrl-scroll keys, the workload jumps, and
it kinda goes crazy, because it keeps tossing that output.
