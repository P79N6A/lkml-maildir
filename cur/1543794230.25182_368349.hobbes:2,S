Hi, There!
On a newly installed 2.6.14.2 (vanilla), when I do a
root@testserver: /$ find | grep something.conf
I get
.....
find: WARNING: Hard link count is wrong for .: this may be a bug in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf option.  Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have been searched.
According to google, this might be a kernel bug due to some problems in /proc, see:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2005-September/msg02474.html
Well, how to debug that problem?
Greets,
