Two things annoyed me with Joliet CD-ROMs:
  * All files were executable (mode=0444 fixed only files with dots in
    their names) despite the setting of `noexec' flag.
  * Often there would be 8.3 DOSish filenames in ALL UPPER CASE (at least
    on home made CD-Rs).
So I wrote a patch for iso9660 fs which
  * removes execute permission from regular files when `noexec' is specified
    to mount
  * adds a new mount option, `lowercase' which when activated translates
    all-uppercase file names on Joliet CD-ROMs to lower case.  Plain
    ISO9660 already has `map=normal', and Rock Ridge doesn't need this
    (being case sensitive et al), thus only Joliet CDs are affected.
If this interests anyone else, the patch can be found at

or (without useless introductions) directly at
  
http://www-public.osf.lt/~mgedmin/isofs-2.2.9mg1.patch
I'm not sure if this functionality should be added to the 2.2.x kernel
series.  It would be nice to have at least the `noexec' part (fat, vfat
and msdos fs already do this).
I'd appreciate comments (especially warnings like `it can go wrong if
...').  Since I'm not subscribed to this list (I like to read it on
Kernel Traffic), CC: by mail would be very nice.  Or just direct replies,
if this topic doesn't deserve precious traffic on linux-kernel.
