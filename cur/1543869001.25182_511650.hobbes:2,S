This bit me badly the one time I did a git bisect; it kept ping-
ponging around a big change (sata? xtables?) that required me to
answer the same two dozen questions about ten different times.
If git-bisect itself could manage .config as part of the process,
reverting to the one used with the most-recently-in-the-past try when
it backs up to a revision, that would be, you know, wonderful.
