Ok, that's just strange. 
One obvious thing to do would be to remove all the "__initdata" entries in 
mm/slab.c.. But I'd also like to see the full backtrace for the  BUG_ON(), 
in case that gives any clues at all.

Yeah, I don't think it's necessarily initrd itself, I'd be more inclined 
to think that the reason you see this change with the initrd unpacking is 
simply that it does a lot of allocations for the initrd files, so I think 
it is only indirectly involved - just because it ends up being a slab 
user.

Sounds like a sane plan.
