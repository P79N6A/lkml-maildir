I wouldn't call it completely hogwash - there was a published paper
with a demo of an attack - but still the attack required to so much
preparation and advance knowledge of the system that it seemed
more of academical value to me. At least for the standard kernel
we chose to not care about it. So for seccomp it was also not needed
imho.

I think without the context switch overhead it's a moderately useful facility.
Ok currently near nobody uses it, but having a very lightweight sandbox
with simple security semantics and that's easy to use is a useful 
facility for more secure user space.
It certainly would need to be better advertised to be any useful.
e.g. with a simple user space library that makes it easy to use.

I don't know any details about this, but I would generally trust Andrea not to
attempt to do anything evil regarding kernel & patents.

I can put in a patch into my tree for the next merge to disable the TSC
disable code on i386 too like I did earlier for x86-64.
I don't have a great opinion on the Kconfig defaults, so I won't put
in a patch for that.
