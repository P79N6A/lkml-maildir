Hi,
You said:
> Whenever I invoke zgv, I get on the console:

this is very interesting because I was getting lots of these when I was
experimenting with dumping ELF /proc/kcore to a file. I noticed that it
happens if I dump ioremap'd area so the solution was to add a new flag
bit VM_IOREMAP to struct vm_struct->flags which is set if this vmlist
element is created by ioremap and another one (for good measure) called
VM_ALLOC which is set if it is done via vmalloc(). That way /proc/kcore
would skip the ioremap'd areas and the parity errors disappeared.
Regards,
