I agree that it would be nice to do this merge and that it can be done
without introducing much ugliness. However, removing a whole arch
tree would be a major change considering that we are in the middle
of what is supposed to be a feature freeze.
I'd rather do it early in the 2.7 series unless more people agree it
should be done now.
