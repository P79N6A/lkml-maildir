/boot is a hangover from old i386 systems that could not boot past
cylinder 1024 so you needed a special partition to hold the boot
images.  That restriction does not exist on any system less than 5
years old nor on most non-i386 machines, the requirement for a special
/boot is obsolete on most machines.
System.map is not required for booting, it is only used after init
starts, therefore it does not belong in /boot anyway.
IA64 requires boot files to be in /boot/efi which must be a VFAT style
partition.  Trust me, you don't want anything in /boot/efi unless you
have to.
For all those reasons, putting System.map and .config in /boot is the
wrong thing to do.  There is no point in creating yet another directory
to hold these files when /lib/modules/`uname -r` will do the job.  Even
on systems with no modules, /lib/modules can be created to hold the
kernel specific files.  I put my bootable kernels in /lib/modules as
well, then I have exactly one place to remove to get rid of an old
kernel.
If it makes you feel happier, think of /lib/modules as 'kernel specific
data'.  Pity about the name but it is hard coded into too many programs
to change it to /lib/kernel or /kernel.
