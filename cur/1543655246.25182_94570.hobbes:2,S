It's relatively flexible as to the choice of PAGE_SIZE (it's
MMUPAGE_SIZE that's defined by hardware); about the only constraints
are that jacking it up where PAGE_SIZE spans pmd's breaks the core
vectoring API, PAGE_SIZE >= MMUPAGE_SIZE, both are powers of 2, the
vectors (which are of size MMUPAGE_COUNT*sizeof(pte_t *)) are stack-
allocated, and arch code has to understand small bits of it.
It sounds like we could pick sane defaults based on CPU revision.
