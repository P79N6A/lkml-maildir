Hi Andrew,
In most cases only a single process enters the D-state, this time it was
XFree, but I've seen gimp, firefox, gconfd and bash. Once or twice I did
see two or three processes ending up in uninterruptible sleep, but I
suspect they entered this state at different test-mmap.c runs (I left
test-mmap.c running in a bash loop and checked the system after a few
hours).
Would it be beneficial to keep running test-mmap.c on this machine until
two or more processes end up in D-state? I can leave this machine
running test-mmap.c over the weekend. 
Please advise,
Sincerely,
Michal
