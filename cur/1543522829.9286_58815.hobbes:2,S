under a normal switching workload You get the same performance ( perhaps
less than 1% )
but when the game become hard ( in a task-switching sense ) You get a
logarithmic response of the
scheduler as function of the number of processes ( now is linear ).
The numbers are these :
300 running processes ( I say running not in runqueue )
12 up to 35 in runqueue
I get an 83% performance improvement
2 running processes ( that switch at the same rate of 300 )
I get 11% up to 15% performance loss
But the fact is that normally 2 tasks switches at a very lower factor then
300.
The probability that a task get scheduled or require a schedule() call.
I We apply a liner low we get :
15 * 2 / 300 = 0.1 % loss
in a real 2 tasks workload.
IMVHO we can sustain this loss given the results at higher switching
workloads.
Cheers,
    Davide.
