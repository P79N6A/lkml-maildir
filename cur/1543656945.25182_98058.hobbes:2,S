Indeed.

Yep. Cards with bpp > 32 are rumoured to exist, but there is no fbdev support
for them right now.

And this can be fixed, once we have some fbdev driver that uses bpp > 32.
Note that the size of the entries in the pseudo palette used to depend on the
mode, i.e. u16 for bpp = 16, u32 for bpp = 24 or 32.
