I don't suggest anything, this is already very good. The only goal of
reducing memory write cache is to get a more responsive system when
dumping massive amounts of data to disks, like above, because when
the system starts flushing the caches, you can only wait for it to
finish. But those tests are not realistic loads. A desktop and most
servers will benefit from large caches. But *some* workloads will
benefit from smaller caches if they consist in writing continuous
streams (eg: tcpdump or video recorders). What I suggested to the
user above was a way to get the system more responsive during his
test. It should not have changed the throughput at all if the
hardware was not a bit strange (well, it's a VAIO after all, I've
had one too, fortunately it died one month after the warranty,
putting an end to all my problems...).

Willy
