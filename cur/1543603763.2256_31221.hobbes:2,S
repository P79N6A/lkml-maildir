This loop doesn't generate any page fault, it just allocates virtual
space.

I cannot reproduce anything like that here with 512M on 2.4.11pre3aa1.
the reports I had where all with 4G of ram, in particular with the 3.5G
of virtual memory per-process on x86 which increases the pressure on the
normal zone that in turn showed me the problem.
Anyways now that I think to have seen the issues with normal zone
faliures I will try to address them soon without having to introduce
deadlock prone code into -aa. Probably not today but I hope tomorrow or
on Monday.
