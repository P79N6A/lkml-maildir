Should probably have been unsigned char.

Or maybe it was the wrong format string. Negative numbers become very
long (with many extra "ff"s) in output. I guess it doesn't really
matter, though...
That said, Alexey also had an error in HIS testcase:

Without the third argument to open with O_CREAT, file permissions may
be very strange :-)
Is this small program suitable for inclusion in LTP, maybe? We can
verify that kernel does the right thing by testing readlink(buf) ==
strlen(buf).
But thanks for the fix and attribution!
