What exactly are you not sure of?
- noting the experimental status in the prompt is a common convention
  in the kernel
- "default n"s like here are nops serving no purpose
This leaves only the removal of the "default m"s which I thought would 
be non-controversial since people seeing these options should know best
what they need.
