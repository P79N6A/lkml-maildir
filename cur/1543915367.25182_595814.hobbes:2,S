Well the BIOS is definitely doing it wrong here. As I mentioned before, it was 
setting up
	0-0x100000000 WB
	0xc0000000 - 0x100000000 UC
	0xc0000000 - 0xd0000000 WC
But the Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual states that whenever 
any variable MTRR range overlaps with an UC MTRR range, the range remains UC. 
(Section 9.12.2.3). So in fact what I needed to set was
	0-2GB WB
	2-3GB WB
	3-3.25GB WC
and delete the 3-4GB UC range to get the behavior that the BIOS seems to have 
been intending to set up. (Relying on the default of UC for the unspecified 
ranges.)

Hm. Section 9.5.1 of the doc (table 9-5) says that anything marked UC is 
always UC regardless of the bits in the page table. So with the MTRR setup 
that the BIOS left me with, this is still a no-go. There's no way to get the 
desired effect without completely reinitializing the MTRRs.
Of course, this isn't the only problem with these Asus BIOSs...
