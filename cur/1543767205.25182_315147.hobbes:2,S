exporting the uid using the show_options superblock methods sounds like
a much better option.

Do you use the same suid wrapper hack for mounts as fuse?  Maybe you
should chime in on that thread so we can find a proper solution.

No.  /proc/self/mounts is an ASCII format, so there's no problem with
differemt sizes.
