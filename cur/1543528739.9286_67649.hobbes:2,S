Hi Rainer,
I've occasionally experienced similar errors on my Abit BP6. I think this is
due to the main Intel BX (or equivalent) chip getting hot (mine hangs around
upto 52C!). This would tie in quite well with reports of people running
non-overclocked processors, but getting errors.
IMHO, the (possible) reason for the Abit BP6 giving these errors, is that
the BX chip gets even hotter due to a small area of voltage regulators
nearby which churn out quite a bit of heat - the iBX chip is known to become
flaky at >50C, and being a plastic BGA package heat dissipation is low
anyway.
Try cooling this instead of your processors.
Does anyone know how to tell is it's the local APIC or the one in the iBX
main chip?
Dan
