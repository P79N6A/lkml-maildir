This is actually two problems in one. The latter (BUG) is solved in
kernels later than 2.3.51, but the block size thing is not. This was
introduced when Eric did some of his SCSI rewrite work, I had a patch
to solve that at that time, but then we settled for a quick 2KB only
block size solution. I'll try and locate the old patch and adapt it.
