I really think it's not a "git diff" issue, but it might be a "import" 
issue.
IOW, I think you'd be a *lot* better off just not importing those things 
in the first place (which is what CVS does internally), or possibly 
importing them as two trees (ie you'd have the "non-log" version and the 
"log expansion" version, so that you can track and compare both).
Doing the thing at "diff" time is certainly possible, but this is simply 
much better done as a totally independent preprocessing phase. The diff 
handling is already some of the more complex parts (and very central), it 
would be much simpler and efficient to not try to make that thing fancier, 
and instead solve the problem at the front-end.
