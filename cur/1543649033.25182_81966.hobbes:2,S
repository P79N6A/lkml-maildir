Joint authorship.
"The authors of a joint work are co-owners of copyright in the work" 
(17 USC §201(a)).
IOW They each own a 100% copyright in the work.
Leads to odd situations of course, since one author can do whatever 
they like with the work without any permission from the other authors, 
etc.
