So wrong. Modprobe 5:1 will never load anything, but kill the box in
such case at that time of bootup.

What are you saying? Your picture of hotplug is just wrong, regardless
of "it's up to you". I talk about what people use, and what is
obviously broken currently.

We are _not_ loading a console driver that way, we try to load the
console device itself, not the driver. There is no driver for 5:1 in
any module.

And? Keep on the subject please. It's still a bug to run in a loop
trying something that will _never_ exist.
