Your latest bug report definitely had preempt on, you could see the 
preempt code in the oops output when disassembled. 
Also, could you please enable CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE by hand if you use
the -mm tree, since you definitely hit a BUG() in there somewhere, but in
the -mm tree, the BUG()  message is totally unreadable unless you enable
BUGVERBOSE (and it's not in the config file).
(Andrew - I think you should drop that patch, or at least enable 
BUGVERBOSE on x86 - it looks like it's disabled and with no way to enable 
it in the current -mm tree..)
I _suspect_ you hit the new "list_del-debug.patch" in Andrew's tree, 
because in my tree there are no BUG_ON's in prune_cache() at all. 
If so, I think the last oops you had was
	BUG_ON(entry->next->prev != entry);
in list_del(), but the fact is, the _interesting_ part in prune_dcache() 
ends up being the "list_del_init()" at the top, which is _not_ 
instrumented by the list_del-debug patch.
So what I'd actually _like_ you to do is:
 - test 2.6.8-rc3, but with the "list_del-debug-patch" applied (appended).
   That way the BUG message will actually be readable.
 - add the same two BUG_ON() to "list_del_init()" too, for better 
   coverage. Most of the dcache uses the "init" version.
 - keep PREEMPT on, since it is quite possible (likely) that this is a 
   preempt problem.
I'd love to see if you can hit the BUG() that way.
