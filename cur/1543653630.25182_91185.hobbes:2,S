But if the server goes down, the call can end up blocking for
significantly longer than one minute anyway.

Perhaps, but there are other expectations to keep in mind.  In
particular, when using NFS, the expectation (at least with hard
mounts) is that when the server goes down, the application will simply
wait until the server comes back.  Your change would conflict with
that expectation.
