Argh. Yeah, that's ugly.
How about instead just removing the dependency on I2C, and making it just
select it? (in fact, I'd assume that just selecing I2C_ALGOBIT should
itself cause I2C to be selected, but I've not checked the dependency
chain).
That's really what the true dependency is, logically.
