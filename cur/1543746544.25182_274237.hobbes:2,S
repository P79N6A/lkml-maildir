Thanks a lot for taking this further.

I expect you're right: I have neither machines nor expertise to say.

Yes, I agree, that's a welcome improvement.  I'm surprised if all
those ia64_elf32_init checks are necessary, but better safe than sorry.
Something crosses my mind, you'll know better than I: is it possible to
construct ELFs or A.OUTs which would need the check in insert_vm_struct
to be even more defensive?  That is, should it also be checking that
vma->vm_end > vma->vm_start (vma being the one to be inserted)?
Or that vma->vm_end <= TASK_SIZE?  If I remember rightly, a 0-length
vma can cause confusion but survive quite well until exit_mmap's
BUG_ON(mm->map_count).
