Sorry, but I passed lot of time on this last year without any answers or 
comments from the community when I have sent my patches.
Now I'm working on something else and I can't spent more time on this for now... 
Futexes are so complex that it is always difficult to investigate a problem in 
only one or two hours...

Without robust futex, the concept works well, and the performance gain has been 
proven.
It violates the rtmutex semantics badly by introducing

What you call a hack, is for me a design point. And if this is a hack, then I 
think that we can say that futexes are based on a series of hacks...
But, okay, this is not very constructive, so...

Once again, it's a pity that people didn't spent time to comment on this when I 
was working on this.
Now, the work will probably just be lost...
