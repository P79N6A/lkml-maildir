Alas, I would like to report it doesn't work for me. 
My laptop suspends, but never comes back from suspend as well. 
It doesn't seem like the LID or power buttons are a possible setting
for me. Doing a 'cat /proc/acpi/wakeup_devices' gives:
Device  Speep state     Status
C04E       5            disabled
C0A0       3            disabled
C0A6       3            disabled
C0A9       3            disabled
C161       3            disabled
C162       3            disabled
C177       4            disabled
C11E       4            disabled
C11E is my suspend button, but it doesn't seem like it will allow S3? 
I have no idea what the other addresses are. I tried enabling them
all, and got a big pile of oopses (which I can duplicate if anyone
wants)
Any ideas?

Yeah, if it helps some people then it should go in I would think. 
It would be nice if we could just set the list of wakeup devices to a
sane list for everyone tho. Power/lid/suspend button. 
Back to using nigels swsusp2... at least it's quite fast and the
latest one seems pretty stable with 2.6 for me at least. ;)
