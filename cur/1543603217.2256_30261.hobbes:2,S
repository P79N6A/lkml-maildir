Stelian: Okay, the patch you submitted under the Subject heading
"[PATCH 2.4.10-ac3] move DMI scan before other subsystem init (especially PnP)"
applied cleanly over 2.4.10-ac3, built and ran correctly on my
ThinkPad 600.
Alan: I'd suggest that this patch (Stelian's dmi scan relocation)
go in next, if it's altogether kosher.  I'll submit a new version
of the pnpbios "additional fixes" patch once that's done.
