I wonder if there is a way of making the kernel decide whether it can boot successfully or not. For example, lets think of that i am compiling an update kernel not on the local machine but on any other pc using telnet or ssh emulators. And eventually it is time to reboot the machine and and run on the new kernel. However there has been an error during the compiling. - such as misconfiguration. Normally the machine will not boot and halt. So, is not there any way to reboot itself from the previous kernel after some time that it realizes it cannot boot properly. Maybe there is such a way. But, if not, this is an imaginary. Because i usually see these kind of problems ;)
   Bye.
