Y should be a FAQ by now...
From the kernel 2.2.x sound documentation:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Persistent DMA Buffers:
The sound modules normally allocate DMA buffers during open() and
deallocate them during close(). Linux can often have problems
allocating
DMA buffers for ISA cards on machines with more than 16MB RAM. This is
because ISA DMA buffers must exist below the 16MB boundry and it is
quite
possible that we can't find a large enough free block in this region
after
the machine has been running for any amount of time. The way to avoid
this
problem is to allocate the DMA buffers during module load and
deallocate
them when the module is unloaded. For this to be effective we need to
load
the sound modules right after the kernel boots, either manually or by
an
init script, and keep them around until we shut down. This is a little
wasteful of RAM, but it guarantees that sound always works.
To make the sound driver use persistent DMA buffers we need to pass
the
sound.o module a "dmabuf=1" command-line argument. This is normally
done
in /etc/conf.modules (or the more proper /etc/modules.conf) like so:
options sound           dmabuf=1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This information is also true for kernel-2.0.36 rpm packages provided
by RedHat.
However adding this line has the following problem:
If in your /etc/conf.modules you have something like:
	alias sound sb
	
which is typical for RedHat administration, you will not be able to
execute
	modporbe sound
since  the option "dmabuf=1" would be passed to sb module instead of
the sound
module! You need to do `modprobe sb' instead. Since pesistant DMA
buffers make
sense only when you insert the sound module at boot time, I suggest
you make the
following change to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit:
change the line
	modprobe sound
to 
	modprobe `grep -s "alias sound" /etc/conf.modules | awk '{print $3}'`
This is what I did and it works fine.
If you prefer it in a patch form, here it is:
