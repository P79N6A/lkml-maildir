Hello,
              I saw one of your ads.  Our company is called MSI we are based in Phoenix, and we specialize in helping adult businesses get set up with credit card machines and merchant accounts. It works out very well because a lot of customers prefer to pay with credit cards and will spend more on credit cards.  All you need is a valid checking account to receive your money and you will be approved.  We have the lowest rates in the industry and can avoid all of the problems that can come with paper trails and charge backs, we gaurantee you will receive your money in a timely fashion. And it will significantly increase your sales and quality of calls. 
             The basic expense is 1.69% to process credit cards and 30 cents to swipe a debit card.   You lease our services for $99.00 a month which includes your new machine and will easily pay for itself when it helps you make more money.  There is no out of pocket fee to start up.  Most banks don't deal with adult businesses, but we are willing to because we know how lucrative it is in your industry to accept credit cards. We can get you approved and will help you get more money, because that is how we make money. My office line is 877 423 3480 ex 209(Malachi)and we are usually here 9 - 5 Arizona time.  Please call if you have any questions and have a great day.

 If this is something you are interested in call me and we will fax all of the applications and info needed, and it takes 3-5 days to receive your machine.
