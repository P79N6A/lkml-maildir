Sorry. It was more of just getting a proposal on thoughts on making this
default. I wasn't too sure it would fly. :) I should have been more explicit
with my intentions. It does fix some broken systems I have seen though with
no ill side effects. I would like to see this tested on more than the systems
I have access to in order to see what kind of fall out there is.
