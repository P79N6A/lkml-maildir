Subject: [PATCH] Intel Manageability Engine Interface driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The Manageability Engine Interface (aka HECI) allows applications to 
communicate with the Intel(R) Manageability Engine (ME) firmware.
It is meant to be used by user-space manageability applications to
access ME features such as Intel(R) Active Management Technology,
Intel(R) Quiet System Technology and ASF.
The patch is large so I'm placing the diff on the web for download
rather than attaching it here.  Download:
