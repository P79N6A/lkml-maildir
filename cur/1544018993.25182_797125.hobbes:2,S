Andrew, thanks a lot! I'm really always impressed how you manage to find time
to grep through all the threads, even those nobody cared to look at for months.

Hmm, well, the failure that did then follow with that kernel version is 
more or less my fault. Actually the system does recover after some time,
except with the kernel version I had installed there:
Its a bit difficult to explain and please skip this part if is too boring.
On the other hand, below is the explanation of another scsi-eh bug:
The firmware of the same vendor manages to crash sometimes.
The units will then still accept basic scsi commands, but everything related
to real io will timeout, since it is a bug in their cache logic. So the linux 
scsi error handler will activate send recovery commands, but nothing related 
to io, and so it will succeed to 'recover' the device.  Normal io will
continue, but timeout again...  The error recovery loop would last endless. 
So I introduced additional patches, which only allow a maximum number of 
errors within a time limit to offline really failed units. 
Well, in that kernel version, I still had the number of error and the time
as fixed parameter, in the mean time it is adjustable by sysfs (I didn't post
the patches yet, see below why).
Probably the real solution would be to let the error handler to read some bytes
from the device after the basic recovery.

I posted a patch, but never got a comment on it.

I don't think it is qlogic-specific. On the same qlogic controller also
more recent Infortrend device are connected (by fc-switch) and with 
these units the sync-cache timeouts never came up. The issue may be worked 
around by a higher timeouts (one needs 120s for all Infortrend units anyway)
and also by not using raid-6 on these specific units. But except throwing
away all these specific units, there it no real solution ;)
Thanks again for your help,
Bernd
