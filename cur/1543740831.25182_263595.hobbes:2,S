I have this feeling Linus is laughing at us when he debates these 
arguments. Nonetheless I finally feel obliged to say a "release 
candidate" is a release candidate. It should only be called that if it 
is planned to be the real version, and the real version is _exactly_ the 
same bar the version number. If it isn't even planned to be released 
unmodified it's a -pre patch.
/me still hears Linus laughing. He's only been doing this for 13 years.
Cheers,
