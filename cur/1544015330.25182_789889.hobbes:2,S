Subject: TMDC Joystick no longer works in kernel 2.6.28

Up through kernel version 2.6.27.9 I have had no problems with
my joystick on the game port.  Now with 2.6.28, the game port
is recognized when the gameport and ns558 modules load, but
loading the tmdc module doesn't also automatically load joydev,
and even loading joydev manually doesn't give me a working
joystick.  There are no error messages in dmesg, /var/log/messages, 
or /var/log/syslog.  This is on Slackware 12.1, so I don't think
it's a distro issue.  Do I need to do something different than
in the past to make it work, or is there some debug I can turn
on to give more info?
Please CC me.
Thanks,
