Sorry I made a mistake here earlier. On checking the ACPI spec
again it's valid to have distances < 20 (e.g. for a 1.5 NUMA factor
it would be legally 15) 
So better just check > LOCAL_DISTANCE, not >= 20.
Also a lot of Opteron BIOS get that wrong, but I'm adding some
sanity checking now so it should work in future.
