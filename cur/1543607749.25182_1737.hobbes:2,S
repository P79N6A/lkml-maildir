Why would you ever want to run a binary optimized for the i686 on a
i386-optimized kernel?
Typically you will want to have a "base" glibc around which really
serves the lowest common denominator (i386) and then optimized versions
in the i686 / mmx / sse subdirectories which will run whenever it is
possible to run
