Oh, how nice to see that somebody else is also seeing the problem :)
I actually exchanged some mails with Joerg Schilling regarding this
problem; this was not entirely constructive as he insisted on this
being a bug in the Linux kernel -- he called it the "read-ahead bug"
and told me to upgrade to the latest dev kernel (I was already running
it) or switching to Solaris (oh yes).
The other fact that could be related, so he told me, is that cdrecord
burns CD's in track-at-once mode, not in disk-at-once mode. Not sure
if this is the root of the problem.
I gave up trying to find out the cause and learned to live with this
"misfeature": After creating an ISO image, I simply append an MB of
zero's and burn the extended file: dd if=/dev/zero >>cd.iso bs=1k
count=1024.

Mine is a K5, ncr53c8xx, but I have the same recording device.

Interesting. My CD's show this error even when read with an IDE drive,
under all kernel versions.
My guess is it's either the CDR55S or the TEAC driver in cdrecord.
