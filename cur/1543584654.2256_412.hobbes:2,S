Using a server works le bios and kernel 2.2.19pre11 SMP
we get the following message at the end of any reboot attempt (including
the magic alt-sysrq-b):
Disabling symmetric IO mode ... ... done
and then the system freezes requiring a manual reset.
Since we are looking at 100 of these to expand our cluster, it is a non
trivial annoyance, any help would be appreciated.
