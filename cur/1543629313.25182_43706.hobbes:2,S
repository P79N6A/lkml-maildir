I only have third hand information, rather than real experience in
this particular area, but I believe the general idea was to map
the window for any given card onto it's own node's physaddr space.
For a general dirty kludge, we could allocated DMAable memory by
simply doing an alloc_pages_node from node 0 (assuming a max of
4Gb in the first node ... if we really want a bounce buffer *and*
we have more than 4Gb in the first node *and* we have a 32 bit
DMA card, we can always alloc from ZONE_NORMAL on node 0 ... yes,
that's pretty disgusting ... but 99% of things will have 64 bit
DMA).
