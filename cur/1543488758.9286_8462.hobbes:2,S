That is just a DOS limitation, AFAIU. Linux is happy living completely in
"extended" partitions.

The current partition scheme allows for further partitions via the kludgey
"extended" stuff. You'd have to stay backwards-compatible there too... and
that gets just too painful: You'd have to record the other (>= 4)
partitions twice.
BTW, there are several decent partition layouts, f.ex. BSD. Linux just
doesn't use any of them on ia32 (at least by default) to be able to coexist
with DOS et al. On SPARC it uses Sun's partition scheme, etc. I suspect
this was one of the factors that made Linux the most popular free OS, not
one of the *BSDs.
