Running 2.6.15 vanilla. I am unable to unload acpi-cpufreq - I always get 
{pts/1}% sudo rmmod acpi_cpufreq
ERROR: Module acpi_cpufreq is in use
I do not see, how can I actually "release" it. Also, the reason I need to 
unload it - I am testing alternative CPU frequency driver and would like to 
avoid reboot when switching. This driver unloads just fine (it is written by 
me and contains the minimal set of functions).
Ay idea?
regards
