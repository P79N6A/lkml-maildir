This provides minimal protection if any: the user may remount any block
devices on any given tree in his 'namespace' (in the sense of "that is
what we call a mount-table in Linux").  *
If I understand what Hans is looking to get done, he's asking for
someone to architect a system where any given process can be restricted
to seeing/accessing a subset of the namespace (in the sense of "a tree
of directories/files").  Eg: process Foo is allowed access to write to
/etc/group, but _not_ allowed access to /etc/shadow, under any
circumstances && Foo will be run as root.  Hell, maybe Foo is never able
to even _see_ /etc/shadow (making it a true shadow file :).
Hans, correct me if I misunderstood.
[*] Somebody really should s/struct namespace/struct mounttable/g (or
even mounttree) on the kernel sources.  'Namespace' isn't very
descriptive and it leads to confusion :(
