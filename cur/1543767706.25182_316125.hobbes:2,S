In my example, a stack trace will be already generated by an oops:
[4300748.423000] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual 
address 6b6b6b7b
[4300748.423000]  printing eip:
[4300748.423000] d0927366
[4300748.423000] *pde = 00000000
[4300748.423000] Oops: 0000 [#1]
[4300748.423000] PREEMPT
and so on, with a call trace:
[4300748.423000] Call Trace:
[4300748.423000]  [<c0104bfa>] show_stack+0x7a/0x90
[4300748.423000]  [<c0104d7d>] show_registers+0x14d/0x1b0
[4300748.423000]  [<c0104fcc>] die+0x14c/0x2c0

[4300748.423000]  [<c02b88fd>] tty_wakeup+0x5d/0x60
I think that maybe it's good to put a:
       WARN_ON(!mm);
but a BUG_ON or without this patch, the kernel will halt, even if the 
problem is not so severe.
