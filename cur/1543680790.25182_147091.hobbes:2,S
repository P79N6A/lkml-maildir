yes, once i found the "buffer write failed" i knew it wasn't a random
reiserfs oops. just missed it first time, sorry.
and i think that close timming of oopses was caused by some cron job
started at this time, the one that does search through entire fs tree...

sure if there were real errors, but with earlier kernels we get
this errors in logs but no problems or data loss. strange...

well i cannot do a lot of reboots on this box, so i guess i just
try to move promise to another host with another scsi hba and see if
it works... 
Big thanks for quick reply!
