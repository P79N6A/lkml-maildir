Hmm, since it will be optional to leave the procfs interface in the
kernel, it is on the admin / distribution builder to decide this.
I know only one tool that uses this interface (pktsetup), maybe there
are others, but if the sysfs interface will be available in future (?),
there is another (simple) option to control the driver, using simple
shell commands e.g.
And i read anywhere, that procfs should only contain process information
in a far away (?) future ;)

Then move it to debugfs and drop it from procfs.

Ok, 1k is a little bit high, since only about 300 chars are written
into the buffer currently.
But also, pkt_print_info() would only write sizeof(buf) chars into
the buffer.
