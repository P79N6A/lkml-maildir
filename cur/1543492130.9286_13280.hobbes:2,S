Hi,
I am experiencing some problems in compiling a working mp kernel. 2.2.x
ran fine, but never could make 2.0.36 detect both processors. My machine
is an IBM Netfinity 5000, with 2 PII-350 processors... I edited the
makefile and uncommented the SMP lines :
SMP = 1
#
# SMP profiling options
SMP_PROF = 1
compiled the kernel, ran lilo properly, but nothing happened.. I can see
in /proc/cpuinfo just processor 0, and also just one of the LEDs is on
(these netfinity series have two leds showing which cpu is being used).
Please let me know...
cheers
Kledi
P.S. please reply to me directly, i am not on the lists.
