There's <= 2500 messages (sendmail - usually <5 concurrently) going
through per day, some 10.000 pop connections per day (mostly at working
hours). The server's got some 256 megs of RAM, and is doing some small
databases with postgresql and mysql in addition to the apache server. The
server does not have any problems with swapping, as the text below should
show.
As far as I can see from linux/mm/swap.c, it shouldn't have anything to do
with freepages... Am I wrong?
