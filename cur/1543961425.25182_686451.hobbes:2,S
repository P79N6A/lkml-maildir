Could it be that due to latest thermal changes ACPI is reading
temperatures more often, or started to read sensors that interfere with
libsensors?
There was a patch-set that detect such interference from myself and Jean
which was not accepted by Linus.
This is what I got from Jean recently, he should be able to point you to
the latest patches if you want to give them a try:

That's OK, I'll include it in my i2c tree instead. While Linus doesn't
like it, he didn't actually provide replacement code, only a vague idea
which Thomas and myself know by experience, won't work well anyway. As
the checks done by this driver are valuable, having it in -mm and
linux-next is still good.

If you get a conflict you should see something like this when loading
the hwmon/sensor driver:
i2c /dev entries driver
f71805f: Found F71805F/FG chip at 0x290, revision 19
ACPI: I/O resource f71805f [0x290-0x297] conflicts with ACPI region IP__ [0x295-0x296]
