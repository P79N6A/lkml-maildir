I'd also like to add VSTa to that list... although it is definitely
still in the "research" category, it has the virtue of being open
source and truly a microkernel in the classic sense: the only thing
the kernel does is processes and vm; everything else (device drivers,
filesystems, networking, etc.) is a user process.  And it is fast,
even on a 486!

I absolutely adored AmigaOS in its heyday, but it was/is never general
purpose enough; if it were ported to a machine without the Amiga's
sexy hardware, I doubt most people would have given it a second look.
