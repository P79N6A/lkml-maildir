Hi!
[BTW right function to modify is swsusp_shrink_memory, it is quite
clear what it is doing, so finding formula that frees enough to make
it fast but not so much to make it unresponsive should be easy.]

Yes, it is not completely fair. But as I started to use X32 with good
battery... well I'm not really using swsusp any more.

Well, 3MB/sec improvement will save him  seconds on 20, or something
like that, so I guess LZF *is* a way to go, and I'd like to keep that
out of kernel. And I will not accept compression into mainline swsusp;
did that experiment with encryption once already, and I did not like
the result much.
If goal is "make it work with least effort", answer is of course
suspend2; but I need someone to help me doing it right.

Sorry, I was trying to be funny.
