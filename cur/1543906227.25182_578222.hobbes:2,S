Fixes one issue I had in -mm1 (I'm assuming somebody else spotting this one
as well, you dropped it before I reported it.. :)

And the other...
As an aside, it looks like bits&pieces of dynticks-for-x86_64 are in there.
In particular, x86_64-enable-high-resolution-timers-and-dynticks.patch is in
there, adding a menu that depends on GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS, but then nothing
in the x86_64 tree actually *sets* it.  There's a few other dynticks-related
prep patches in there as well.  Does this mean it's back to "coming soon to
a CPU near you" status? :)
