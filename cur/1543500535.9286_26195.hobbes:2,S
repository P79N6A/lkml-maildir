OK. But there is one but - we definitely have flags on ext2, ufs and
<urgh> FAT ("System" == Immutable). I'm more than sure that other
filesystems will join too - we are risking to run out of bits if we will
go for plain union and we will get the whole lot of nasty bit-shuffling in
bargain. I still think that distinction between generic and fs-specific
deserves to be done in API. I.e. we are either passing raw attributes and
then the result is fs-specific (and it's fs responsibility to recalculate 
generic attributes) or we are interested in generic attributes and then we
don't want to mess with fs differences. <generic> + <ext2-specific> +
<ufs-specific> + ... in one bitmap will lead to major PITA. <generic vs.
raw> + {<generic attributes> | <attributes of whatever fs it sits on>}
will give us decent bandwidth and make extensions *much* easier.
	Hmm... Methink I know what should be done here:
chflags(name, level, old, new) where level being either FL_VFS or
FL_EXT2 or FL_UFS, etc. IOW, the scheme similar to setsockopt().
Comments? That way we would get an additional safety - if the call is done
for the object on wrong fs it will return -ENOPROTOOPT ;-) IMO it's
cleaner and will reduce the future clutter.
	Comments?
