Right, we should not start multiline modalias sysfs files. Eighter we
get all aliases encoded in a single string, maybe like macio is doing it:
  
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=drivers/macintosh/macio_sysfs.c#l42
and we can pass that single string to modprobe, or we better stay with
the current one-line udev PNP rule which uses /bin/sh to do the job, which
works just fine.
Also MODALIAS in the event environment is required at the same time
the sysfs file is added. And that should also not be a multi-line
value.
Thanks,
Kay
