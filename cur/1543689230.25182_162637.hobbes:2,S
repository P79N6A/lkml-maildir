Subject: 2.6.0-test4-mm5: SCSI imm driver doesn't compile

The following compile error (tested with gcc 2.95) seems to come from 
Linus' tree:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC [M]  drivers/scsi/imm.o
In file included from drivers/scsi/imm.c:55:
drivers/scsi/imm.h:105: duplicate array index in initializer
drivers/scsi/imm.h:105: (near initialization for `IMM_MODE_STRING')
make[2]: *** [drivers/scsi/imm.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The problem is the following code in imm.h (with 
CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16 enabled):
<--  snip  -->
...
static char *IMM_MODE_STRING[] =
{
        [IMM_AUTODETECT] = "Autodetect",
        [IMM_NIBBLE]     = "SPP",
        [IMM_PS2]        = "PS/2",
        [IMM_EPP_8]      = "EPP 8 bit",
        [IMM_EPP_16]     = "EPP 16 bit",
#ifdef CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16
        [IMM_EPP_16]     = "EPP 16 bit",
#else
        [IMM_EPP_32]     = "EPP 32 bit",
#endif
        [IMM_UNKNOWN]    = "Unknown",
};
...

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
