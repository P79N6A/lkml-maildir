Smaller, more frequent patches, have the advantage of getting more widespread
testing of a common codebase - the problem with testing individual patchsets
separately is that it's quite possible that with only a few people testing any
particular combination, bugs appear in a large -pre or -rc patchset, and prevent
others from testing the rest of that patchset easily.  A -pre every week, even
if it only had a few changes, would get more bug reports in, (in my opinion).
John.
