The filesystem internals have to be substantially changed for
journaling, but the on-disk filesystem *is* just marked by a flag in
the ext2 superblock which indicates that there is a journal present.
You can thus migrate between ext2 and ext3 on disk easily, but you
cannot use the same kernel code to mount ext2 and ext3.

The final release will have the journal in a hidden inode.

There already is.  You can also remove journaling from an ext3
filesystem.
