Yes, that is the expected behavior.  It will go away eventually; this is
part of the transition while the old .config format is still valid.

Just the (undocumented) v command would have done it.  It was expecting a 
numeric debug level argument.  I've fixed it to treat "v' alone as a command
to increment the debug level.

No matter how one approaches the figures, one is forced to the rather
startling conclusion that the use of firearms in crime was very much
less when there were no controls of any sort and when anyone,
convicted criminal or lunatic, could buy any type of firearm without
restriction.  Half a century of strict controls on pistols has ended,
perversely, with a far greater use of this weapon in crime than ever
before.
