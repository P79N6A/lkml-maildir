At the very least I can use etherboot as a NBP in PXE terms.   So I have
a reasonable client after the first tftp transaction.

I routinely support an initrd with:
glibc.
/bin/bash
dhclient
mke2fs
mkreiserfs
parted
sfdisk
mount
pivot_root
etc.  (All binaries were striped though).
And I usually have to pass an ramdisk_size=XXX option to the kernel or
my decompressed initial ramdisk is to large.  I use it for setting up
a local filesystem on a cluster node.  And I was able to setup an
entire cluster 1000 node cluster in about 15-20 minutes.  (Multicast cuts
down on the bandwidth requirements which is very nice).
With a good bootloader it does not much how big your initrd is.  I
totally agree that small is good and important.  At the same time
ipconfig.c is wrong.  It is great during development and on systems
with a single NIC.  But the hard coded policies can be bad for
production systems.  Not that hard coded policies are bad in general
just the kernel is the wrong place to put them.

Similar functionality is definitely needed.

True.  But when things are important and the there is GPL'd firmware
available that actually works properly.  It is worth putting it on the
requirements list of things to do.
