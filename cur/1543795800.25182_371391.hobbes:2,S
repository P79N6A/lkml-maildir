I'm pretty curious about it too, none of my debian-based boxes have
'gdb' anywhere in /etc/init.d.  The only thing I see is that the shell
script /usr/bin/mozilla-firefox calls gdb when passed '--debugger', or
when the DEBUG environment variable is set...  Perhaps he's doing that
during his .xsession?
