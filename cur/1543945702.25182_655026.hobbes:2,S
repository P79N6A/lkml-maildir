Hi
It looks like there is something weird as my systems stops when the
swap is mounted.
I've played bisection game and this is the commit which makes the
system unusable:
# bad: [45b503548210fe6f23e92b856421c2a3f05fd034] [RTNETLINK]: Send a
single notification on device state changes.
git-bisect bad 45b503548210fe6f23e92b856421c2a3f05fd034
I've tried to reverse this commit - and it has compiled & worked.
