 I've found i82489DX docs to be most comprehensive in this as well as
other areas.  The integrated APIC doesn't seem to differ much from the
i82489DX wrt the arbitration -- the only difference is the focus processor
checking feature that can't be disabled for the latter.

 Basically there is no way to arbitrate with the FSB delivery.

 Hmm, i82489DX docs explain it best, IIRC.
