I have a bit in the PTE that tells me if there is an MMU hash table
entry for the virtual address represented by the PTE.  This bit is not
affected by set_pte or ptep_get_and_clear etc. and it is not part of
the swap-entry fields of the PTE.  Thus I need to have the PTE page
still around at the point where I flush stuff from the MMU hash
table, even though all the PTEs in it have been cleared, so that I can
avoid searching the hash table for PTEs for virtual addresses for
which I have not put a PTE in the hash table.
Now I could of course try to come up with some other way to store this
information, such as a bitmap associated with the mmu context.  The
bitmap would be 96kB in size for a 3GB userspace, though.  It could be
allocated on a page-by-page basis, I guess.  But all the schemes I
have thought of so far end up being more complex than using a special
bit in the PTE.
Regards,
Paul.
