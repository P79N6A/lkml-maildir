Subject: Sound problems with 2.2.7 (not present in previous kernels)

Last week I read a message on the list ("2.2.7 UP and alsa sound
problem") with some interest.  Although I share relatively little in
common with the previous poster (I'm running 2.2.7 SMP with the kernel
sound modules for a Creative Vibra 16/Pnp), I'm experiencing most of
the same symptoms.
I'm having mp3 playing skip a /lot/.  My box is a dual PII-300, and
mpg123 reports using ~6% CPU, so it's almost got to be a memory issue.
I've got 128 physical, 128 swap.  One interesting thing I've noticed
is that 2.2.7 memory usage appears a lot different than, say, 2.2.6.
This is the typical result of free:
itp@geodesic:~$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        127984     124872       3112      48900      11100      67096
-/+ buffers/cache:      46676      81308
Swap:       128484       1436     127048
I realize that 124 megs aren't actually being used by programs, but it
was never this high with previous kernels.
I'm also experiencing the problem with periodic difficulty opening
/dev/dsp.  This may last for several minutes, a few seconds ... I
haven't yet found a pattern to it.  The strace reads exactly like the
previous poster's, ie:
open("/dev/dsp", O_WRONLY)              = -1 ENOMEM (Cannot allocate memory)
write(2, "Can\'t open /dev/dsp!\n", 21Can't open /dev/dsp!
) = 21
_exit(1)
I tried unloading and reloading the modules for sound, and it still
wouldn't work.  Then it seemed to clear up by itself -- I tried
cat(1)ing a random file to /dev/dsp, and it made noise.  So I went
back to mpg123, and it worked again.  For a little while, and then it
would flake up again.
Anyway, the thread (at least on the LinuxHQ archive, where I browse
the list) is missing several messages, but from what I see, people
told the original poster that this was offtopic/not a kernel issue.
I'm running a plain vanilla 2.2.7 build, and am experiencing the same
problems.
I'd be more than welcome to provide any more information that is
needed to clear this up, but I'll need to know what to do, as I'm not
a kernel hacker in any way, shape, or form.  Please keep me CC'd on
any replies, too, as I'm not subscribed to the list.
