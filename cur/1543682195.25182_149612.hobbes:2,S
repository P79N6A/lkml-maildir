It looks like it's a bug in the core code because when I was testing 2.5.70,
it was on a athlon XP pr2600, and the via-rhine module oopsed (because it
was started before the usb modules), and then it would hang.
I didn't report it because I wasn't able to capture the oops. :(
I'll do more to try to reproduce manually without the hotplug scripts.
(I'll bet it has something to do with one of the hotplug modules being
loaded).
