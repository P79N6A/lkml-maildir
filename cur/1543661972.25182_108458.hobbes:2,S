not really, i thought the -b was telling this ?
i think average filesize should be somewhere from 1-5 megabyte
(zipfiles few megabyte/videofiles (can be a few gigabyte)/installation
files for programmes)
i also wonder what kind of chunk-size i need to use
i use 64k now, but i wonder if 256k (or something bigger?) would be better
(does chunk size difference in performance between a 4disk raid5 and a 15disk raid5 ?)
