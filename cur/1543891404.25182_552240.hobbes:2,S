spose so.
I think it'd be better if we kept the WARN_ON_ONCE(size == 0) in there,
because it is exposing some coding warts.  But we should turn it off for
2.6.22 and make it conditional on CONFIG_DEVEL_KERNEL (or whatever it will
be called) later.
The BADPTR thing is a little worrying because it will make
previously-working-by-luck code go oops.  I guess we can live with that.
So we end up with the BADPTR code enabled even in production kernels, in
which case your ((unsigned long)x <= 16) trick is worth doing.
