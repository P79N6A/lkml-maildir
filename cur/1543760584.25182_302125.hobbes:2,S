Dear Alan,
I am positive. I can setsockopt, and then, getsockopt returns the value 
that I requested.
Stevens very clearly states that SO_RCVLOWAT has a direct impact on 
select() and I assumed that this would be the case for Linux.
What is the rationale for not complying with that ? Is it the micromanagement
of select() that you dislike ? Isn't a significant reduction in the
amount of read operations a real gain in high speed networking ?
Best Regards,
Felix
