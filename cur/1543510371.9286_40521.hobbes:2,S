Hi !
Semantics of O_RDONLY  was always zero since UNIX  6 at least.  Identificator of
O_RDONLY was appeared in UNIX 7.
The only two problems I see here.
     1. bad driver writers.
     2. O_NOACCESS feature itself.

Try it on Linux ;-) O_RDONLY is 0, O_WRONLY is 1, O_RDWR is 2, O_NOACCESS
is 3. In order to open anything with O_NOACCESS, you're required to have
both read _and_ write access.
