Unfortunately, it happens all the time, even if the CPU load == 0.00. I don't 
have any other PS/2 devices (since I don't have a PS/2 port ;p) but I do use 
a USB mouse - but this is totally unrelated to this problem.

Well... This causes X to bomb out with not finding any Synaptics device - 
which If i understand the driver correctly is quite correct at this point.
The fact is, it worked _perfectly_ under 2.6.5 with the standard mode. No 
problems whatsoever. Something must have changed (but I'm too unfamiliar with 
kernel code) that causes some sort of a delay in the processing of the input 
queue of the touchpad. 
I've upgraded the X driver, but that changes nothing.
