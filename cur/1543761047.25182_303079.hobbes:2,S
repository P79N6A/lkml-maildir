Looks like I never learned to apply the concept of reducing fractions :). Thanks for catching this.

Initially, I was going to take this approach but that would require some specific platform defines to be thrown into a global header file (mpparse.c would need to see them as well). I didn't think it would be appropriate to mix code like that. I'll be glad to revise the patch to include enumerated identifiers but would it be more acceptable to comment on the semantics of the es7000_plat var in the platform specific "es7000plat.c" file?
