Well after all I got my ISAPnP modem working on Linux.  I never had to do an actual
ISAPnP config before, but now I gess it is mandatory.  This is what I learned:
* pnpdump --config >/etc/isapnp.conf
(some changes may need to be made to /etc/isapnp.conf to work correctly)
* isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf
* setserial /dev/modem auto_irq autoconfig
And it's done.  Pretty nice, but it seems like a longer process now, not what you
would call progress if you ask me...
