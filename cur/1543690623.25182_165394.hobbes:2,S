I was referring to the "strict overcommit" mode described in 
Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting. To me, it sounded like it was 
describing modes that were alternatives to the proposed kernel panic on 
oom, and I was merely suggesting we use the same /proc/sys/vm method to 
specify oom behavior (maybe a string rather than numeric codes in case 
we have several such options in the future). Apologies if this is not 
related to what Rusty is talking about.
Thanks,
Rahul
