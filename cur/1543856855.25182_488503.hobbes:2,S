We are able to depopularize a portion of the pages in a MAX_ORDER chunk if 
the page structs pages on the borders of that portion are not stored on 
the DIMM. Set a flag in the page struct of those page struct pages 
straddling the border and free the page struct pages describing only
memory in the DIMM.

This is *node* hotplug and we already have a node/zone structure etc where 
we could set some option to require only movable allocations. Note that 
NUMA nodes have always had only a single effective zone. There are some 
exceptions on some architectures where we have additional DMA zones on the 
first or first two nodes but NUMA memory policies will *not* allow to 
exercise control over allocations from those zones.

I still do not see a need for additional zones.
