Run something that has a sane VM in all the known awkward cases (eg the Red Hat
2.4.9 tree) and you should be just fine. If not I'd be interested to know
For the newer trees I can only get stability under high loads with either the
Andrea -aa vm patches or Rik's rmap-11b patch. Both of which seem to help
no end.
