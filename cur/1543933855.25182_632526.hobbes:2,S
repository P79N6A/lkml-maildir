Hi,
you guys were right, I was wrong.
It is the hardware. 
I increased ram voltage by 0.15V on the 22nd and hadn't any oopses since then. 
And I did torture the system.
I am deeply sorry that I wasted your time (but still puzzled that the oopses 
started after kernel update - maybe I should buy a new psu... ).
So it is not reiser4  nor the kernel, just the ram needs a little more 'juice' 
than the board delivers on 'auto' settings.
Glück Auf
Volker
