Uhmm... call me slow, but I don't get it 100%... so this message has NOTHING
to do with the LPT IRQ7? It just signals this because IRQ7 is the lowest
priority IRQ on the 8259A?

Umm.. so again.. this means that the IRQ is not held long enough for the PIC
to actually recognize *what* IRQ was asserted?

Thanks a bunch for clearing this up (this far)!!
When we get a firm indication on the 'problem', could the "spurious 8259A
interrupt" message be de-obfuscated into something less unsettling?
PS. Real Men (tm) never reads the datasheets!
