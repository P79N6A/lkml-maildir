I made a custom board that interfaces a Philips SJA1000 CAN controller to my 
PC's PCI bus.  The device works fine until I start receiving lots of 
interrupts from received CAN messages, and the PC completely locks up.  I'm 
sending 3 messages every 10ms from a DSP.  It usually takes 10-60 seconds for 
a lockup on a 2.66GHz P4.  Here are the details:
First, the chip's interrupt line is active low and remains low until it's 
interrupt vector is read.  If Linux doesn't run my ISR immediately, the pin 
is remains low.  Is this a problem?  I'm wondering if Linux clears the PC 
interrupt and adds my ISR to a queue to be run.  If so, I would expect Linux 
to be receiving thousands on interrupts before the interrupt is actually 
cleared.  This may explain why I'm receiving thousands of interrupts that 
have a null interrupt vector (no interrupt source).  Can I make the interrupt 
edge-triggered?  I suspect I'll need to redesign my hardware.
Second, if I do not service the interrupt (return IRQ_NONE) I get a message in 
syslog that the interrupt occurred and was disabled because 'nobody cared', 
which is fine, but then a segfault appears in syslog.  I suspect this is a 
bug in the kernel.
