 From the authors blog when he did that graph:
 
http://jeffr-tech.livejournal.com/10103.html
"So I updated the image for the second time today to include Ingo's cfs
 scheduler. This kernel is from the rpm on his website. I double checked
 that it was not using tcmalloc at the time and switching back to a
 2.6.21 kernel returned to the expected perf.
 Basically, it has the same performance as the FreeBSD 4BSD scheduler
 now. Which is to say the peak is terrible but it has virtually no
 dropoff and performs better under load than the default 2.6.21
 scheduler. "
