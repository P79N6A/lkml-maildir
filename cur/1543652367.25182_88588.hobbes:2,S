HI,
I've just installed 2.4.20-rc1 to avoid i810 lockups on 2.4.19. However
playing stuff with xmms I've just got
Nov 12 21:03:12 duocity kernel: i810_audio: DMA overrun on write
Nov 12 21:03:12 duocity kernel: i810_audio: CIV 9, LVI 6, hwptr 4808,
count -5640
Also whilst typing this the machine locked hard but nothing in the SYSLOG.
I was moving quickly through my playlist which might of caused an
overrun.  Also is there anyway around the 48Khz only playback as 24Khz
mp3's obviously play to fast
Rgds
