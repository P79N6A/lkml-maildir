There didn't seem to be much interest in my earlier post about kernel 
behavior when swap thrashing.
So my question is, are we not concerned about system behavior when one 
process uses so much memory that it grinds everything else to a halt?
It appears that a thrashing process is being given more preferential 
treatment than it should.
