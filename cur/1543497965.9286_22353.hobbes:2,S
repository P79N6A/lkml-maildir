AFAIK PCI is endian-independent.  (I think I saw that in a post from
Martin Mares recently?)  It is only that 99.999% of the PCI devices out
there are PC-centric and little endian.
Anyway... one question.  Who does the byte swapping, the host CPU or the
peripheral?
If the answer is 'host CPU', then my response is I can write clean code
that is faster because it takes advantage of big endian peripheral
support.
It seems to me that, with the amount of video data being transferred to
a hi-res video card, a lot of byte swapping is avoided by the host CPU. 
Is this incorrect?
(I don't have a big endian machine to test my assertions)

Point taken ;-)
