Every distro has different needs for its device naming and groups and
other intergration into the boot process.  To force all of them to unify
on one-grand-way-of-doing-things would just not work out at all.
Look at all of the variations in the udev tarball between the different
vendor configurations (we put them in there for other people to base
their distro off of, if they want to.)
So providing this config in the kernel will just not work, sorry.
