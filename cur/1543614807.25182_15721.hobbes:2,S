Got also my patched 0.12 freezing system later (kernel 2.4.17). Didn't saw
that earlier with 2.4.17-pre2. Also tried to move port I/O stuff from
__i810_update_lvi() to start_adc() and start_dac() inside if block to 
avoid any possibility of doing wait loop when noting is done in start_dac()
and still get system locking up when loading driver. Perhaps I should
recheck with kernel 2.4.17-pre2 (I didn't have problems with it before
leaving to Finland now more than 2 weeks ago)

Kernel 2.4.17 compiled with gcc-2.95.3, devfs is enabled, ext3 filesystem (I
	 would prefer not to hang system with ext2, ext3 seems to
	handle that nicely)
XFree86-4.1.99.2 (cvs  update -r xf-4_1_99_2 xc; ....)
KDE-2.2.2 release (compiled here with gcc-2.95.3)
Contents of /proc/pci attached
KDE sound server settings:
	Start aRts soundserver on KDE startup - on
	Enable network transperancy - on
	Exchange security and reference info over the X11 server - on
	Run soundserver with realtime priority - off
	Autosuspend if idle for 5 seconds
	Display messages using artsmessage
	Message display: errors
	Sound I/O method: autodetect
	Enable full duplex operation: off
	Use custom sound device: off
	Use custom sampling rate: off
	Other custom options: off
	Audio buffer size: 278 millisoconds (12 fragments with 4096 bytes)
	I have setup to play one wav file from VFAT32 partition at KDE startup
Perhaps I'll look into that in next Year only. It seems I'll have to repeat 
enabling debug output from i810_audio driver and to put additional output 
there to see where I have the trouble.
