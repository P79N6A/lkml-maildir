While we're on the his topic -- I am trying to set up a new test 
machine with an Ultra66 controller and an HD larger than 32MB. Which 
kernel release would be my best bet? -- 2.3.x is fine. I have the 
system running RedHat 6.1 off the logic board IDe controller and a 
5GB drive, and I plan to remove this smaller drive once I have the 
test system running.
Thanks, igor
