If you mean noclobber as in bash's "set -o noclobber",
then it only applies to shell redirection (try: help set)

What are the values of $stolen & $switched?
FIFO named pipes is not a real file, they do
not contain any data, so to clobber or not to clobber
is not a question.
But there is an interesting behaviour of pipes (I have
no other unix box I can try, but linux 2.0.36 & 2.2.2pre2)
1 $ mkfifo fifo
2 $ echo "blah" > fifo &
3 $ cat fifo > fifo &
4 $ cat fifo #if this does not exit after "blah" string is read
press ctrl-C, line #2 should exit.
5 $ echo "blah again" > fifo # this should return immediately
and BOOM! Job line #3 will loop with 90-99% CPU usage time.
Note this doesn't not happen if you skip line #2 (and/or #4).
Could someone with access to other Unix flavour check
this one out...

These commands does not involve any shell redirection...
