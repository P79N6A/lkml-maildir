Sorry - I am unable to make sense of your question.
Below some remarks, maybe related.
Some remarks on scancode sets live on
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-7.html
Not all keyboards support all scancode sets. For example,
my MyCom laptop only supports scancode Set 2, and its keyboard
does not react at all when in mode 1 or 3. 
The normal, default mode is translated scancode set 2.
Putting keyboards in other modes is asking for trouble.
