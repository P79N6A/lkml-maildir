That sounds good to me. But I worry about having to do release synchronization
on every css_put(). The current patch I have, but does not work 100%
does the following (WARNING: white spaces ahead, do not use the patch
directly)
-       if (notify_on_release(cont)) {
+       if (atomic_dec_and_test(&css->refcnt) && notify_on_release(cont)) {
                mutex_lock(&container_mutex);
                set_bit(CONT_RELEASABLE, &cont->flags);
-               if (atomic_dec_and_test(&css->refcnt)) {
-                       check_for_release(cont);
-               }
+               check_for_release(cont);
                mutex_unlock(&container_mutex);
That way we set the CONT_RELEASABLE bit only when the ref count drops
to zero.

Yes, that is correct, the advantage is that with can_destroy() we
don't need to go through release synchronization each time we do
a css_put(). May be the patch above will fix the problem along
with your release locking proposal.
