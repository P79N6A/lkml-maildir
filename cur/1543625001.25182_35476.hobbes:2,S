BK works that way on purpose.  If we merge changes into your local changes,
there is no automatic way to "unmerge".  It is way to easy to do a pull,
do the merge, and then realize you lost work in the merge because you told
it to do the wrong thing.
Short summary: commit your changes before you pull and you'll be fine.
