That IP policy covers their members and has no bearing on us as we have no 
agreements with them.
The code is "our" own so it isn't covered by any IP or copyright 
restrictions other than the GPL.
There aren't any patents relating to SD cards.
The simple sequences we use have been gleaned from various public documents 
(intel's website, SD card manufacturer data sheets, etc.) so nobody can 
claim we're using anything secret.
I therefore can't see a problem with including the code.
