If you really need these functions then they should be made non-static 
and exported. Duplicating the code is not a solution.
I'm not so sure you actually need all that, though. I suspect you can 
likely handle the deferring of commands if you detect an FPDMA data 
phase inside the qc_issue function only (like you already do in some 
cases) instead of having to mess with deferring them at the SCSI layer.

The case where the command didn't generate a D2H FIS should likely be 
investigated further, otherwise we don't necessarily know that this 
workaround will work in all cases?

But the D2H FIS can contain an error indication, correct? If that 
happens here it won't detect this. In this situation error handling 
should be triggered.

There have been reports of some drives with bad NCQ implementations that 
return completion status for commands that were not issued. If we detect 
this case we should raise an HSM violation which will disable NCQ on 
this drive if it happens repeatedly. See the code in ahci.c in 
ahci_host_intr.
