no, the scheduler doesnt revoke RT privileges, it just 'delays' RT tasks
that violate the threshold. In other words, SCHED_OTHER tasks will have
a higher effective priority than RT tasks, up until the CPU use average
drops below the limit again.
the effect is pretty similar to starting too many Jack clients - things
degrade quickly and _all_ clients start skipping, and the whole audio
experience escallates into a big xrun mess. Not much to be done about it
i suspect. Maybe if the current 'RT load' was available via /proc then
jackd could introduce some sort of threshold above which it would reject
new clients?

please debug this some more - the kernel certainly doesnt do anything
intrusive - the clients only get delayed for some time.

yeah, i'll add this to /proc, so that utilities can access it. Jackd
could monitor it and refuse to start new clients if the RT load is
dangerously close to the limit (say within 10% of it)?

well, there's setrlimit, so you could add a jackd client callback that
instructs all clients to change their RT_CPU_RATIO rlimit. In theory we
could try to add a new rlimit syscall that changes another task's rlimit
(right now the syscalls only allow the changing of the rlimit of the
current task) - that would enable utilities to change the rlimit of all
tasks in the system, achieving the equivalent of a global sysctl.
