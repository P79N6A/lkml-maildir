Ian has lots of bugfixes and and feature patches (like direct mounts)
going to the autofs mailing list.  Autofs4 has always had stability
issues in 2.4.x, and its been lacking in features.  This makes myself
and others run a bastard combination of amd, autofs and editing
/etc/fstab to get "automounter" features even close to the solaris
automounter.  If these can go into 2.4, which will be "stable" and in
use in lots of places for the next couple of years it could help by
encouraging the distros to get behind autofs4 (hint hint, redhat,
hint).
