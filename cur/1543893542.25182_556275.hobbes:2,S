Patches look nice, but unfortunately only -mm stuff and will need to be
rebased once 2.6.23 opens anyway.
Where are we on the ondemand read-ahead merging? -mm has continually had
different read-ahead code than mainline now for seemingly years, seems a
bit pointless to me. Either we get the stuff merged, or toss it out.
Nothing needs to simmer that long.
I suspect we wont see any real potential regressions before it hits
mainline anyway.
