Hello Kernel Group:
I obtained patch-2.3.34 and applied it to 2.3.33 which is working
correctly.
The patched kernel source is failing to compile.
Included are My .config file and the make dep error file also make
bzImage error file.
Kernel 2.3.34 fails to compile both System.map and bzImage.
Kernel 2.3.33 is working 
This system is SuSE6.3 / AMD K6-I/350 64Meg
