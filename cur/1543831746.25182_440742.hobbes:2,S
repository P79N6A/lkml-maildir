I rather like the idea of allowing metadata to be on another device in 
general, or at least the inodes. That way a very small chunk size can be 
used for the inodes, to spread head motion, while a larger chunk size is 
appropriate for data in some cases.
Larger max block sizes would be useful as well. Feel free to discuss the 
actual value of "larger."

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
