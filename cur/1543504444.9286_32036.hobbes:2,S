Maximum debug mode is an exceptionally good idea. "Writing Solid Code" calls
this "Fortify your subsystems" and I wholeheartedly agree.
The ones who you thought had the bug are most likely to be the ones who are
perfectly fine, if we pay any attention to Murphy ;-)
If this is done in a kernel macro or not is beyond my understanding of the
kernel code, though it appears to make sense to me. However, it is a good idea
to add as many of these assertions as possible.
(That having many assertions will make the kernel timing change and most
heisenbugs will disappear when you start debugging is another problem)
Sincerely,
