i tried this on a recent -rt kernel and there's no delay:
  [root@europe ~]# time /sbin/hwclock --hctosys --localtime
  real    0m0.756s
  user    0m0.754s
  sys     0m0.002s
could you try a more recent kernel like 2.6.20-rc2-rt3? We fixed a good 
number of high-res timers related bugs that could result in similar 
hangs. But maybe it's still unfixed, it's just a guess.
