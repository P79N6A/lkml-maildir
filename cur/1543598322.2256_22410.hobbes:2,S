Right, the local APIC is enabled very early, for some reason I don't recall right now.

Hmm, the "noapic" kernel option does not and never has had anything to do with
the local APIC, only the IO-APIC which is a completely different beast.
However, RedHat 7.1+ added a bug in init/main.c where they bypass the second
half of the UP APIC initialisation if "noapic" is specified. So using "noapic"
you now end up with the local APIC enabled but its PM code disabled. Nice, eh?

Please try this with a normal 2.4-ac kernel. Add a printk and a delay at the top
of apm.c's send_event() so we can see exactly which events occur. Boot with
UP_APIC enabled. Initiate suspend: did apm.c log an event and if so which one?
Try to resume: did apm.c log anything before the machine rebooted?
