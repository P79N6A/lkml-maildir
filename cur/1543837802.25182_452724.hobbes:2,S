  Well, probably no as you say so.
  What I did for CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME is just to fix a compile
error and to see if the kernel boots or not.  As I mentioned,
it's experimental and is posted to see whether I'm moving in the
right direction or not.
  I'm afraid I have not yet looked into any generic time related 
features/implementations.  Looks like generic time related things
should be on the ToDo list.
  Thanks a lot for your response.
