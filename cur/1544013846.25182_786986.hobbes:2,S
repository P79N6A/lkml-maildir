Not unless you call uClinux (MMU-less) a real distribution, no.

We have similar cross-build issues without MMUs... I.e. that a lot of
useful packages don't cross-build properly (including many which use
Autoconf), and it might be easier to make a native build environment
than to debug and patch all the broken-for-cross-build packages.
Especially as sometimes they build, but fail at run-time in some
conditions.
But you're right it's probably insane to try.  I haven't dared as I
suspect GCC and/or Binutils would break too :-)
I'm sticking instead with "oh well cross-build a few packages by hand
and just don't even _try_ to use most of the handy software out there".
You mentioned ARM Debian.  According to
http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort
 one recommended method of
bootstrapping it is building natively on an emulated ARM, because
cross-building is fragile.
