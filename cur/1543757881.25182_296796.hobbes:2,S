Hello!
I once again tried reiserfs, this time on my ibook:
ei ~ # mkreiserfs  -V
mkreiserfs 3.6.19 (2003 www.namesys.com)
ei ~ # uname -a
Linux ei 2.6.10 #5 Sun Feb 6 17:26:47 CET 2005 ppc 750CXe PowerBook4,1 GNU/Linux
If I tar xf $big_tar (speaking about the gcc-source), my system hangs:
- no console switching
- all keyboard input is lost
- no mouse reaction
- no network response
- no display refreshing 
When doing that on my dm-crypt-jfs home partition this does not happen.
Nor does it on my xfs root partition.
Is that a normal behaviour of reiserfs 3.6?
Greetings,
Nico
P.S.: I never assumed reiserfs will ever be a stable filesystem, but this
      is the worst result I have with it. Perhaps I am missing
      some tuning/mount option?
