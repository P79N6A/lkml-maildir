It is a bit of a hack. I was trying to reduce the reprogramming needed
if something like vfork or fork with a flag that made it equivalent to
vfork.
The second part about the parent expecting an OOM terminated child
is almost a given (and is buggy). The expected OOM termination would
usually be to issue an error message about the condition rather than
"can't execute yyyy", which implies that it is the exec that failed
instead of memory allocation.
The biggest problem I have been able to identify is that when
the unreserved memory is copied via COW, either the parent OR child may
be doing the write. The only alternative is that the memory be marked
COW for the child only. This however might affect those long running
processes that fork just for the purposes of saving the "current" state
of a large array; this case really does call for COW on both parent
and child - as well as full reservation on fork.
