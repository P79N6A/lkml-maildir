What about doing a similar thing as a device mapper target? Have a look a 
dm-cache, I know that development of that has stopped but it doesn't mean 
it couldn't be ressurected. It has an advantage that it is generic (any 
two block devices will do) and you don't need to populate the "cache" on 
start-up - it happens automatically through cache misses.
Another use could be a flash based disk accelerator which may be pretty 
popular nowadays.
