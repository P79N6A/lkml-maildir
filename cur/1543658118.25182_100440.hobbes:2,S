Sweet, and true.
The effect is shipping a binary alone without its associated kernel is the
distribution of a product independent.
One other point, about RMS and FSF ... They have no stake or holding in
the linux kernel, only a license about distribution.
So when the poke there nose in this issue and interfere in the operations
and business, they are exposing themselves to litigation.  This was an
interesting point made to me and I think it needs research.
Something else that needs research is a linuxgram story which I am having
trouble tracking down.  It has something to say about a FSF/GPL
certification audit for $25,000.00, regardless if it is open or closed.
If this is true, a conflict of interest, and a huge grey area is worthly
of investigation.  The questions to ask:
Who has requested certification?
Who has passed?
Who has failed?
Has any one failed?
If the last question is answered by "none" ...

Thanks is has been fun and informative.
