however, 
I don't think there should be any casting of IO addresses for the simple reason that the void __iomem * 
is a part of an interface which does the right thing in both MMIO/PIO cases. The lkml 
thread "Being more anal about iospace accesses.." contains the answer to 
that in a great detail. As a result, the right thing to do here is, I think, to declare all addrs void __iomem*.
Which leaves a question: while compiling the following code fragment:
<sound/pci/ymfpci/ymfpci_main.c>
  static inline u8 snd_ymfpci_readb(ymfpci_t *chip, u32 offset)
  {
          return readb(chip->reg_area_virt + offset);
  }
gcc complains as so:
sound/pci/ymfpci/ymfpci_main.c: In function `snd_ymfpci_readb':
sound/pci/ymfpci/ymfpci_main.c:57: warning: passing arg 1 of `readb' makes pointer from integer without a cast
Do we have to cast here or use the new interface?
