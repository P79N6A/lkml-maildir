Looks perfect. And I agree that current_{,now} etc. is better than my
suggestion of current_{avg,now}.
(I used free text instead of diff -u so I can give the rationale;
should have included both, I guess).

Sure. But It will require some thought. For example, the interface
will need to encompass the non-symmetric pair of force commands on
ThinkPads:
"discharge the battery until further notice" vs.
"don't charge the battery for N minutes".
Also, ThinkPads express  the start/stop charging thresholds in
percent, whereas I imagine some other hardware will represent it as
capacity.
What other examples do we have of machines with battery control commands?
