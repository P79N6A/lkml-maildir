This is definitely something that can be done (and should) - well,
especially having ability search by certain criteria - then all sorts
of statistics and databases can be created.
Everything that helps  to find a way to work on a patch and to test
easier should be done to make bug fixing easier and even possible.
Often times the most knowledgeable people are not able to make quick
fix just because there is no way to reproduce the case or get access
to HW.
