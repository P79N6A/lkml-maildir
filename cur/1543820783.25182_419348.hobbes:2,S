Whoa! Can't get worse. 
Hmm. OK. Maybe it can. It seems that IDE at least used to do the
"*200" behaviour.
I now issue a read for (1k-)block 1024 on my disk, which has blocks
1024 ... 1536 being bad. Kernel has decided i'm doing linear reads, so
it will issue a readahead for 1024-1536. 
I then don't want to have the kernel continue the 1025-1536 readahead.
Also, if just block 1027 is bad, a normal read of block 1024 will read
the page 1024-1027, and return EIO on 1024 because it couldn't read
the whole page. We've learned to live with this, but if you guys are
going to look into it, keep this in mind, please....

I (accidentally) scratched a SCSI drive with a paperclip some weeks
ago. 65 bad blocks. (36 files hurt). I did manage to use the paperclip
to push the metal part that had fallen off the inside of the drive
somewhere to a spot where I could remove it. That metal part was
preventing the head from leaving the parking zone. 
Anyway, I have enough disks with bad blocks that I can make the
following offer: Serious kernel developpers that need a
drive-with-bad-blocks for testing should submit their snail-mail
address. I'll see what I can do. (Specify SCSI or IDE or both).
