I think you have a different standard than I do [1]. According to K&R,
2nd ed, section A2.5.1 (Integer Constants):
        The type of an integer depends on its form, value and suffix.
        [...] If it is unsuffixed octal or hexadecimal, it has the first
        possible of these types ["in which its value can be represented"
        -- from omitted]: int, unsigned int, long int, unsigned long
        int.
Which means 0xdeadbeef is a perfectly valid literal for an unsigned int.
