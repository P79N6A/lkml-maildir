I've been getting errors replying to you but had no alternative address 
to use. perhaps you could mail me from another account ?

Good stuff.

I had been meaning to move all the c code referencing SD to a seperate 
sd.c file such that it could be compiled optionally on top of MMC. at 
the time it wasnt mature enough to be worth it, but that may be worth 
revisiting now.

Good. This was needed.

Good (see above :)

Is this needed? presumably any controller that implements MMC/SD slots 
can only have one card/slot anyhow.
Mind you, I have plans to look at SDIO, so that may alter things...

The toshiba controller appears to want to be told when an ACMD is 
issued, compared to a normal CMD.

The card specs I have seen were public docs so we should be clear there.
