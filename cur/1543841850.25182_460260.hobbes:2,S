Too friggin' hard to test Alan's stuff for older IDE here, therefore 
ignored so far :(   I have some old hardware that Alan is addressing, 
even an old IBM 260MB PCMCIA HDD.
I can't see an easy way to arrange multi-boot with different /etc/fstab 
depending if I'm trying /dev/hdaX or /dev/sdaX.  Parallel '/' partitions?
Plus, 2.6.18-rcX fails too early in boot on one machine (p100 IBM 365X) 
for any testing.  Suggestions welcome...
Grant.
