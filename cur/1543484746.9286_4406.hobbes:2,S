It used to use slabs, and memory usage was _horrible_.

We had it already for a short moment in the 2.1.x series, and it simply
didn't work very well. It had all the slab problems with multi-page
allocations, and inodes also have very hard-to-predict allocation
lifetimes, so what happened was that when you allocated a lot of inodes,
the pages were almost never freed back to the page pool, because there was
often a few inodes holding things locked down anyway.
It's a long time ago, but I essentially reverted it within a few releases
because _I_ had problems with it (and that's on machines with plenty of
memory).
