Seems to fix it for me on a D620.
Bisecting on mainline gave commit
f42649e84831efc69d5f621f1c36a39b4e384a99 (Input: ALPS - handle
errors from input_register_device()) as the place where the
trackpoint half stopped working.  I don't necessarily believe it,
unless the psmouse_reset on failure caused problems without
logging anything.
