Hi all,
Hate to bother with 2.0.x stuff, but.....
Recently my ailing Western Digital HD started spitting bad blocks at a 
rapid rate, and so I purchased a brand spanking new Seagate Medalist to 
replace it. Nice, shiny fast, supports UDMA, and hook it into my UDMA 
enabled motherboard.
Kernel detects it as UDMA, and treats it with kid gloves, till it reached 
the spot where DMA is enabled with hdparm in my rc.local.
Approximately 5 seconds later, total lockup. No keyboard. No syslog. Hit 
the reset switch. No fs errors (thank goodness), but no useful log of 
what happened.
Now, if I disable UDMA in the BIOS, the drive acts fine, and drive 
reports itself as capable of DMA. Enabling DMA at this point causes no 
problems.
As I said, the new drive is a Seagate Medalist, UDMA, 128k cache, 4.3G.
Motherboard is an Intel TX, NOT TX Pro.
Ideas?
Thanks in advance,
Victor
