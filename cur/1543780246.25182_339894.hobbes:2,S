Note that PREEMPT is known to cause problems on ppc32 ... I'm not sure
what's up yet.  (Random SIGILLs/SEGVs in userland typically)

radeonfb should only rely on the console semaphore....

radeonfb is mostly inactive after it has setup the framebuffer and
unless you actually draw something, in which case, accel code is called.
_However_ there is an unrelated problem with some panels, including some
of the 17": The panel doesn't always "sync" properly. This seem to be
related to some subtle timing issue in the LVDS code but I don't know
exactly what yet. You can usually get it back by repeately turning the
backlight all the way down (which shuts the panel off) and back up until
it "catches".
