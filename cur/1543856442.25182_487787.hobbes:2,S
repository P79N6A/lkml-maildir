Subject: any value to "struct configfs_attribute" anymore?

  as a followup to my previous patch submission, is there any value to
the definition of "struct configfs_attribute" in configfs.h anymore,
given a similar structure in sysfs.h?
configfs.h:
-----------
struct configfs_attribute {
        const char              *ca_name;
        struct module           *ca_owner;
        mode_t                  ca_mode;
};
sysfs.h:
--------
struct attribute {
        const char              * name;
        struct module           * owner;
        mode_t                  mode;
};
  if these two structs are *necessarily* identical, then it would make
sense to remove the few remaining uses of the former and replace them
with references to the latter, no?  there are only a few files that
appear to still make reference to the former:
fs/configfs/inode.c
fs/ocfs2/cluster/heartbeat.c
fs/ocfs2/cluster/nodemanager.c
fs/dlm/config.c
so standardizing on the latter would be fairly easy.  or is there a
reason why those two structures still have to be treated
independently?
