Ok, but that was totally unclear to me which suggests it should
be somewhere in the description/changelog and possibly in the comments.

How about RevG?

But such changes should be separate.

I don't think any Linux relies on that MCE for cooling so that seems like
a highly hypothetical situation. You would need a kernel driver for it
because there is no way to get it in user space even using a mce trigger.
If anything that should be handled through ACPI thermal trip anyways.
I think my point stands that this is not critical.

Sure.

Ok, but that needs to be documented somewhere. Otherwise people will
eventually find out and then require lots of research to find this out.
e.g. if you had a high level comment that says
/* AMD Fam10h supports thermal throttling. When such a event happens we do 
 * .... because of X Y Z. Implement this in the following code.
 * We don't do it on K8 due to crippling errata.
 */
it would have been all clear.

initrd user space can run in parallel with __initcall and in theory
it could trigger CPU hotplug events (and do lots of other things too) 
It's quite unexpected and regularly causes bugs.
A lot of subsystems are racy this way.  Also it's not easily fixable because 
of locking problems in the cpu hotplug subsystem.
I just mentioned it for completeness; fixing it is probably beyond
scope of your patch and not a merging requirement.

Lighter but still a hack.  I don't insist on it, it just makes
your code uglier than it could be.

All __initcalls are in process context. late etc. just changes the
ordering inside them.

You set different handlers depending on the CPU type.

If you just set different handlers you don't need it at all.
