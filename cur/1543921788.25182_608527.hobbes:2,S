Using notify_on_release doesn't make any guarantees that the
notification, or the action based on that notification, will occur
before the cgroup becomes busy again.
An rmdir() on a busy cgroup is perfectly safe, it just fails with
-EBUSY. I'd just like to avoid making active control file fds trigger
than failure mode.
