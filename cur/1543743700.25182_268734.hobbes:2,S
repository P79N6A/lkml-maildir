My argument started when people starting complaining about new compilers being
slow, and using that as the only reason to not use them.
A single datapoint by itself can not be used in an argument here.
You are adding additional requirements(using older hardware), as that makes
the argument valid.

Not always.  Older gccs accepted bad code; you can't honestly expect newer
ones to always accept this bad code.
Note: I'm not saying that's the specific case here.
