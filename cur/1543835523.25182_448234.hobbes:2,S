To recap, cpufreq died for at least two people (Tomasz Torcz and me) between
2.6.17 and 2.6.18-rc1. I've cc'd everybody who touched cpufreq according to
the shortlog.
Abundant details are in:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/30/87
New information is that I've narrowed it down from between 2.6.16.9 and
2.6.18-rc1 to between 2.6.17.7 (which works) and 2.6.18-rc1 (which doesn't).
The problem exists both with cpufreq as modules and staticly, and both with
P4 and nforce2.
Please let me know how I can help you solve this problem. I'll try a git
bisect but a lot of the cpufreq changes appear to be interrelated, so I'm
unsure if it will work.
Thanks!
