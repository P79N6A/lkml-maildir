For now, the indexes happen to be the same.  However, for discontiguous
memory systems, this will not be the case
Consider a system with 3 GB of RAM, 2GB@0x00000000 and 1 GB@0xC0000000
with 1 GB sections.  The arrays would look like this:
 
mem | phys
----+-----
 0  |  0
 1  |  1
 2  |  3
See the B-lpfn patch that I posted today for why this is important.  It
basically allows us to represent sparse physical addresses in a much
more linear fashion.
