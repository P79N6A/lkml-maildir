Do you think it's more likely the irq is lost? I think it's more likely
the softirq takes more than 1msec than the irq is lost. If softirq takes
more than 1msec we don't necessairly need to fix that, the timer code is
designed to handle that case properly and the softirq is the place where
to do the bulk of the work, if irq is lost we definitely need to fix
that.
Anyways either ways time may go backwards w.r.t. gettimeofday.
I'm not saying it's a real issue though.
