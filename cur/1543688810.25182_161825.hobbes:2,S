I tried adding a hinting system that let the user
tweak the badness calculated by the OOM killer.
Didn't help.   No matter how I tried to protect
important processes, there was always a case where
the OOM killer ended up killing them anyway.
That was probably just a weakness in how I did the
hinting.  You might be able to do it with some sort of
'for god's sake never ever kill this process' tweak,
but before I tried that, I realized that making OOM
conditions halt the system was what I really wanted
for my users.
