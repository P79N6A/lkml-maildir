Patched against 2.6.19 leads to:
mm/vmscan.c: In function `shrink_pvma_scan_ptes':
mm/vmscan.c:1340: too many arguments to function `page_remove_rmap'
So changed
 page_remove_rmap(series.pages[i], vma);
to
 page_remove_rmap(series.pages[i]);
But your patch doesn't offer any swap-performance improvement for both swsusp 
or tmpfs.  Swap-in is still half speed of Swap-out.
Thanks!
