Actually, I just moved my root and /usr partitions to another hard drive
on Monday using tar on the same 2.6 system. Should that have helped? I
didn't notice any improvement, but the new drive may be a little slower
(its about the same age (6 years?) and capacity (4G), but from a laptop).
Maybe I should move also /home over and see if it improves? It is 4 and
a half years old, and probably made with 2.2 kernel. That will require a
little more effort, since I don't have a replacement HD.
