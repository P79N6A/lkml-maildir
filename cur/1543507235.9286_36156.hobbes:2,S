Ahhh, v1.03 uses the memory base register by default.  Memory space access
doesn't work with the Rhine.
v1.03a fixes this.

Hmmm, that's because the probe code in Space.c is calling the driver eight
times.  It should only call the PCI drivers once, and even (especially!) in
the ISA case should give up when no more cards are found.  Probing multiple
times on the ISA bus is dangerous.
