 > I'd love for the -mm tree to get more testing, but it doesn't.
So the question is how to hook up more "customers" for testing thing?
mm...maybe OSDL should provide special live mini-distro weekly, which 
will run entirely from 256 MB USB flashdrive :)
Lot of automated testing, lot of nice and colorful progressbars, graphs 
(it is ubelieveable how people love to watch how defragmentation goes) 
etc. and you are there :)
If the only question is to boot my computer from CD/flash (without 
touching my harddrive) and pushing at the end "I'm agree to send 
automatically collected results to OSDL" then you can count me as a 
tester :)
thanks,
Indrek
