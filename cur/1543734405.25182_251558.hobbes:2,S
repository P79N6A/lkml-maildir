I have 2 machines on the same switch and an IPv6 ssh connection between
them.
"tcpdump -a -i eth0 -v" on both machines shows [tcp sum ok].
The ssh link is an IPv6 one, arwen is the faulty machine, and aragorn a
sane one.
arwen has also a ppp0 interface, no infamous [bad tcp cksum ....!]
appears, on lo interface too. All is reported [tcp sum ok].
But during this time, the kernel keeps flooding the console with these
"hw tcp v6 csum failed"...
Moreover, like I said, the IPv6 networking works fine.
In that case, is it the driver fault?
I wonder if it is possible to print the checksum and the interface with
the LIMIT_NETDEBUG(printk(KERN_DEBUG "hw tcp v6 csum failed\n"));.
Bests.
