That's not Suspend2 itself, but rather improvements to the freezer that are 
logically distinct and would be useful to swsusp too. That said, if the work 
you guys have done in the last couple of days gets merged, perhaps I'll drop 
most of it and just do the bdev freezing instead of sys_syncing, at least to 
check reliability.

No. I have a little cleaning up still to do there, but the current arch 
specific patches are all: 1) adding suspend2.h; 2) old modifications that can 
be cleaned up 3) the odd new routine (eg a page_is_ram function for amd64).

Nigel
