Looks that way.
The "smpboot.c" version is so complicated that I don't want to look what
it does, but the comments certainly seem to imply that smpboot.c should
just do an #include <asm/div64.h> and be done with it..
The do_div() interface is not exactly pretty, but it was designed for
performance and printk() in mind. In particular, it was designed so that
it would return _both_ the remainder and the quotient, as printk() needs
both (the remainder for the actual number, and the quotient for the next
time through the loop).
Also "do_div()" only does unsigned division, which is what most people
want anyway.
So it looks like the smpboot div64() could be re-written as
	#include <asm/div64.h>
	static unsigned long long div64 (unsigned long long a, unsigned long b0)
	{
		do_div(a, b0);
		return a;
	}
but anybody that is nervous about it should probably test that it gives
the same results.
