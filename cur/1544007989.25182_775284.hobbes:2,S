It looks like all of your patches got applied regardless of
what followups they received.
I'll chalk this up to a simple oversight given that Linus just
got back from a week of vacation :)

I'd really like the other sparc changes to get kicked out as well,
which as I just indicated in another reply I put into my
sparc-next-2.6 tree instead.  The risk is just not worth it as I've
broken sparc already with similar "obvious" section fixups.
This is really a big hassle for another reason, because Sam is in the
process of unifying sparc32 and sparc64 in the sparc-next-2.6 tree.
Now that these changes went into upstream it's possible that I'm going
to have a lot of fun sorting out the merge conflicts.  Although some
initial test merges indicate that we might be able get away with this
one with only minor pain.
