Not many really in the core kernel. Hardly any. Grep for 
lock_kernel to be sure, but there is not much.
It's mostly drivers that still need it.
How about the low level SCSI drivers that might called from the high
level SCSI code? 
Anyways starting these kinds of discussions was the goal of the proposal.
Even if Andre's patch ends up not being merged it would have reached
its goal.
