I think Peter meant, that the readahead window was only exposed for
block devices, and not things like NFS or FUSE.

An alternative would be to uniformly use MAJOR:MINOR in there.  It
would work for block devices and anonymous devices (NFS/FUSE) as well.
Would that be any better?

Which ones?  They could possibly be moved to debugfs, or something.
I agree, that sysfs should be relatively stable.
