Or maybe make it a configure option if Linux should over commit memory or
not.
In some cases it would be nice if you could be sure that the memory you got
was actually there, and for those cases you could build the kernel with
CONFIG_NO_MEM_OVERCOMMIT (or something like that) so that linux would simply
report ENOMEM when there's no more memory.
