This will only help to avoid not shooting important daemons.
The real cause, however, seems to be that the filesystem cache
memory is not properly re-used when it should, or, that it tries to
allocate a huge amount memory. The programs themselves do not
allocate much memory! It must be the system, because I also
ran programs with memory restrictions by ulimit. The programs
are definitely not allocating the memory, and, 4GB RAM are really
enough for a simple file server like ours.
