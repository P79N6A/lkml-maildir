There is more, the standard also says that SIGURG should be ignored by
default and currently generates a core dump.
BTW there is one more signal bug, SA_NODEFER currently does not only allow
the sent signal, it disables the complete sa_mask. The fix is easy: take
the sigorset (and the spinlock) out of the condition in handle_signal. I
did sent patch already for this, but it seems it got lost... (so it's
fixed only in the m68k part).
bye, Roman
