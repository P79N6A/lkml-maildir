filesystem detection routines are already available
however, I'm the type to say that in a case like this where it matters you 
should explicitly give the filesystem type anyway.
or the userspace helper functions that setup the instructions for the 
hibernate warn you if you are telling it to mount a filesystem that it 
knows is ext3 and is in use by the system going to sleep.
in any case there needs to be a big warning about this issue, but that's 
different from saying "can't touch any filesystem that was mounted"

this only works if you don't need tasks to do anything to free the memory.

if you are just talking about the I/O time for writing 2G of data, I 
wouldn't worry about it. suspend isn't supposed to change the capabilities 
of the system. if it takes a long time to do the I/O then that's how long 
it takes.
being able to do compression or send the data elsewhere is a good thing, 
but that's not something that is required to be supported in order to meet 
some performance goal or consider the approach a failure.

I may have misunderstood you (I have deleted 90% of the messages in this 
thread so I won't try to go back and find where I thought you said this)

here is where there is some disagreement (although it may just be 
misunderstanding on the 'fully support' phrase)
it sounds like you are saying that the ACPI support requires a lot of work 
(the phrase I've seen some people use is a requirement to 'fix all the 
drivers'). we aren't wanting to have this work prevent the non-ACPI 
hibernation from progressing.
this isn't that we don't want the ACPI support eventually, it's in the 
spirit of 'perfection is the enemy of good enough'
