The kstopmachine is only run on SMP environments, so it won't show up on
your UP machine.

If your box is still running, then no.  But it's now a chore to remove
the yield from this algorithm, since yields have a possibility to
deadlock the system.  Although in this particular case, it may not be a
problem, since the threads that are being waited on are created for
other CPUs.  But I haven't looked too much into what stop_machine is
doing so I can very well be wrong.
Thank you for reporting it, we want to weed out all the yields that a RT
task may call.
