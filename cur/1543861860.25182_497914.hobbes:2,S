kronos:~/src/linux-2.6.git$ cat ../linux-build-git/include/linux/compile.h
/* This file is auto generated, version 14 */
/* SMP PREEMPT */
#define UTS_MACHINE "i386"
#define UTS_VERSION "#14 SMP PREEMPT Tue Jan 9 22:45:18 CET 2007"
#define LINUX_COMPILE_TIME "22:45:18"
#define LINUX_COMPILE_BY "kronos"

#define LINUX_COMPILER "gcc version 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-20)"
LINUX_COMPILE_TIME and UTS_VERSION differs at each rebuild. UTS_VERSION
is responsible of rebuilding fs/proc/proc_misc.o; init/main.o uses just
about everything, init/version.o requires UTS_VERSION.
I don't think it's a regression from earlier kernels though, is it?
