I have just recently noticed that there could be actually one important
thing added to the whole slab stuff:
	Different iterators for the lists (currently called caches) of objects.
This would actually make *plenty* of sense in cases where we are storing
objects which represent linear lists of some kind anyway. This is in
fact a real 
duplication of efforts, since those get linked twofold: Once as slab
elements of 
some category and second on the level of theyr semantics....
BTW> The fact this isn't done as just is just another hint about how
obscure the
features of this device are in some places!
Any toughts?
