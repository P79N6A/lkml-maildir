By reducing the resolution you only reduce the frequency of the cascading, 
but the amount of timer in the timer wheel at any time is still the same.
So in general you will have less number of cascades, but not generally 
smaller cascades. The latter depends on the actual timeout value and its
distribution over the wheel. This means you can tune the resolution to 
avoid most cascading for a specific situation, but that would be a rather 
bad general solution.
rbtree based timer are also not necessarily the better general case. The 
timer wheel still scales better with O(n) compared to the rbtree with
O(n*log(n)).
It's really better to keep the focus of the new timer at high resolution 
timer, that's what it's really better at and we shouldn't try to use it 
for everything only because it has such a kool name.
bye, Roman
