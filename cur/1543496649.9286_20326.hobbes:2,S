More from life's rich learning curve  applying unofficial patches is just 
the first step to writing your own kernel code.... I could stop, If I wanted

For those who were following this on the linux-perf list: we finally got an
engineer to the machine we had running 2.2.8+andrea1, to find that (with a
reasonable degree of certainty) it had died of the 2.2.8 bdfush/update
disaster.
I'm building 2.2.9+andrea3 (I really need that wake-one fix) to see if it
behaves better under heavy web load than 2.3.3.
