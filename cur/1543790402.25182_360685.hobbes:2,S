Hi,
I am seeing the following errors in /var/log/messages when booting
2.6.14-rc5 on a dual Opteron nforce4 motherboard with 8GB of RAM:
Checking aperture...
CPU 0: aperture @ be8c000000 size 32 MB
Aperture from northbridge cpu 0 too small (32 MB)
No AGP bridge found
Your BIOS doesn't leave a aperture memory hole
Please enable the IOMMU option in the BIOS setup
This costs you 64 MB of RAM
Mapping aperture over 65536 KB of RAM @ 8000000
...
PCI-DMA: Disabling AGP.
PCI-DMA: More than 4GB of RAM and no IOMMU
PCI-DMA: 32bit PCI IO may malfunction.<6>PCI-DMA: Disabling IOMMU.

Attached scsi disk sda at scsi2, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
Kernel panic - not syncing: PCI-DMA: high address but no IOMMU.
With 2.6.13, the systems boots OK with these messages in the log:
Checking aperture...

Aperture from northbridge cpu 0 too small (32 MB)

Using git bisect, I narrowed the problem down to the following commit:

    [PATCH] x86-64: Avoid unnecessary double bouncing for swiotlb
    PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS has to be zero even when the GART IOMMU is disabled
    and the swiotlb is used. Otherwise the block layer does unnecessary
    double bouncing.

Reverting this change allows 2.6.14-rc5 to boot.
