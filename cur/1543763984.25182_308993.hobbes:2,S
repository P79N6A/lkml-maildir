Damn, I did compile-test this thing, but didn't remember to compile even 
one of these as modules.
Andrew, do you want me to send a new patch with this fixed, so you can 
back out the current one and apply the new one, or can you simply merge 
this one from Adrian?
If I have to send a new patch, I might as well also fix the "int should 
be size_t" thing that Andres Salomon pointed out.
