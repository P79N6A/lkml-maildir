Can anyone bring real life examples for this pretended harm?
All examples I have heard until now fall under one of the following:
- CONFIG_MODULES=n wouldn't be worse
- if you want your kernel to fit on a floppy, CONFIG_UNIX shouldn't be 
  the thing making the difference between the kernel fitting on the
  floppy and the kernel not fitting on the floppy
And I'm surprised that everyone thinks the world would stop turning if 
the kernel image size is increased by CONFIG_UNIX=y, but the same people 
were quiet when during the 2.5 development the discarding of __exit code 
moved from link time to run time on some architectures (e.g. i386) 
making the kernel image size bigger for everyone.
Is there much FUD in this thread or why do people pretend to care in the 
CONFIG_UNIX case but don't care when the __exit code is discarded?
