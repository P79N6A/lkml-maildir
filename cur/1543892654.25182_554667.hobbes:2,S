I'd have hoped to see containerstats.c in here.

I don't understand the relationship between containerstats and taskstats. 
afacit it's using the same genetlink channel?

This seems to mean that the containerstats commands all get renumbered if
we add new taskstats commands.  That would be bad?

Would it be suitable and appropriate to embed the delayacct_set_flag() call
inside delayacct_blkio_start()?
