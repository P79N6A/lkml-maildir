Still it looks more like the kmalloc is wrong, since this function is
called like this:
        struct raid1_bh * r1_bh;
...
        r1_bh = raid1_kmalloc (sizeof (struct raid1_bh));
...which should allocate sizeof(struct raid1_bh) bytes (and clear them),
not allocate sizeof(raid1_conf_t) bytes and clear sizeof(struct raid1_bh)
bytes...

I'd still like to have reschedule or something in there, it loops VERY fast
as it is at least on UP machines when the kmalloc fails...
Perhaps print just one message for one call to raid1_kmalloc() no matter
how many times the kmalloc() in there actually fails would be right way to
print the message.
