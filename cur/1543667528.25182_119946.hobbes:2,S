Hi Martin,
    I must say that I think it is an excellent strategy.  I will admit
though, that I have voiced this opinion several times in the past and
it seems that most people disagree with me.
    I think we do a disservice to people by encouraging them to believe
that the kernels they download from kernel.org can be depended on to
work.  Kernel.org kernels are effectivly a way for people to participate
in the development process and to help with QA.  If you dont want to
be involved with these activities, you really do not want to use those
kernels.
    We could try and make that guarantee if we wanted to, but it would
be a lot of work and the vendors are already doing it.  So why not
leverage their work?
Thanks,
Jim
