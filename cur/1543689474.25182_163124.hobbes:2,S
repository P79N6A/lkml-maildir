My fault. I should have atleast test compiled cyclone timer code.

How about the attached patch (against mm4), that moves all 
calibrate tsc functions into a common file, avoiding the duplication. 
This time I could successfully compile cyclone timer too :). However,
I had to do an unrelated one line change in fixmap (last chunk in 
the patch) to compile for summit.
