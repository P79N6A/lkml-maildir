It seems to have been broken a while: According to test.kernel.org (last
machine in the matrix is an SMP mode p650), it broke between 2.6.14-git2
and 2.6.14-git3. Console output can be found in:
http://test.kernel.org/15622/debug/console.log
   for the failed one
http://test.kernel.org/15530/debug/console.log
   for the successful one
