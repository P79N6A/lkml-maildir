I have an HFS (apple) filesystem on a megneto-optical disk. When I try
to mount is with: "mount -o loop -t hfs /dev/sdb3 /mnt/mo" it fails:
Mar 30 16:07:17 Jay kernel: sd.c:Bad block number requested I/O error: dev
08:13, sector 2
Mar 30 16:07:17 Jay kernel: hfs_fs: unable to read block 0x00000002 from dev
07:00
Mar 30 16:07:17 Jay kernel: hfs_fs: Unable to read superblock
Mar 30 16:07:17 Jay kernel: sd.c:Bad block number requested I/O error: dev
08:13, sector 0
Mar 30 16:07:17 Jay kernel: hfs_fs: unable to read block 0x00000000 from dev
07:00
Mar 30 16:07:17 Jay kernel: hfs_fs: Unable to read block 0.
8:13 is sdb3. Why does it try to read something from dev 07:00 (/dev/vcs0) ?!?
When I do the same thing with a CDROM everything works fine. Both CD and MO
are
connected to the same SCSI controller (adaptec 2930) and block size is 2048.
I have to use the loop device because HFS wants block size=512.
Linux 2.4.13-pre1 and 2.4.19-pre2, PowerPC 750.
Bye.
