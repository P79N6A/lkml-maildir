Sounds a lot like the PLFS (process level fair sharing) scheduler in 
Aurema's ARMTech (for whom I used to work).  The "fair" in the title is 
a bit misleading as it's all about unfair scheduling in order to meet 
specific policies.  But it's based on the principle that if you can 
allocate CPU band width "fairly" (which really means in proportion to 
the entitlement each process is allocated) then you can allocate CPU 
band width "fairly" between higher level entities such as process 
groups, users groups and so on by subdividing the entitlements downwards.
The tricky part of implementing this was the fact that not all entities 
at the various levels have sufficient demand for CPU band width to use 
their entitlements and this in turn means that the entities above them 
will have difficulty using their entitlements even if other of their 
subordinates have sufficient demand (because their entitlements will be 
too small).  The trick is to have a measure of each entity's demand for 
CPU bandwidth and use that to modify the way entitlement is divided 
among subordinates.
As a first guess, an entity's CPU band width usage is an indicator of 
demand but doesn't take into account unmet demand due to tasks waiting 
on a run queue waiting for access to the CPU.  On the other hand, usage 
plus time waiting on the queue isn't a good measure of demand either 
(although it's probably a good upper bound) as it's unlikely that the 
task would have used the same amount of CPU as the waiting time if it 
had gone straight to the CPU.
But my main point is that it is possible to build schedulers that can 
achieve higher level scheduling policies.  Versions of PLFS work on 
Windows from user space by twiddling process priorities.  Part of my 
more recent work at Aurema had been involved in patching Linux's 
scheduler so that nice worked more predictably so that we could release 
a user space version of PLFS for Linux.  The other part was to add hard 
CPU band width caps for processes so that ARMTech could enforce hard CPU 
bandwidth caps on higher level entities (as this can't be done without 
the kernel being able to do it at that level.
