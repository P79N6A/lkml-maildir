Hi,
here is a compile fix for the cs4281 OSS driver in 2.5.5-dj3
There were some missing files and includes
The missing files are taken from 2.4.18
Now it compiles and links without errors but I can't test it because I don't have a cs4281 soundcard :(
But be warned... this isn't the cleanest solution
More fixes for some broken OSS drivers will follow (if there are any)
Patch against 2.5.5-dj3 attached
