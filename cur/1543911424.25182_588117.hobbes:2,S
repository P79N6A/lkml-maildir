Hi,
I tested 2.6.23-rc3 along with Debian unstable on a older pentium2-era 
PC that has a ISA bus sound card that isapnp finds. snd-sb finds it too 
using isapnp. However, there seems to be no module autoloading 
happening.
So, the question is: should isapnp moudle autoloading work with current 
kernel + current udev?
