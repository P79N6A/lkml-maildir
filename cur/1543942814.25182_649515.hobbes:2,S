Just FYI, given some of the weirdness we've seen in 8xx chipsets in the 2D 
driver, this new suspend/resume code may still need a few tweaks.  Please 
test it out and report any bugs you find asap (preferably w/o X running as 
that makes things easier to debug).
Also, if you find that your outputs don't come back, I've got an experimental 
patch at 
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14249
 that may work for 
you (this one in particular is the one I'm worried may break 855).
Thanks,
Jesse
