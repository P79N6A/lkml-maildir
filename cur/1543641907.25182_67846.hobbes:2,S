Subject: Poweroff error from 2.4.20-pre5-ac1 w/ Asus A7M266-D motherboard AND question

First the question:
Why does Linux detect my AMD chipset as ONLY the MP and not the MPX? I thought the A7M266-D had the MPX? 
The manual says it does
Secondly the error:
On poweroff: I see:
hdc: failed to unregister!
I have mapped hdc to sdc0 (via SCSI Emulation)
hdc: YAMAHA CRW2100E, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
Vendor: YAMAHA    Model: CRW2100E          Rev: 1.0N
Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Attached scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 40x/40x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
Just to also mention I have enabled the experimental AMD Power Management:
