When I mount a Novell Netware file server on 2.4.19-ac4, I can access it
with a file browser (konqueror, lynx), but ls gives "Stale NFS file
handle" and other bash commands such as find fail. 2.4.16 works fine.
Cheers,
Peter
#strace ls
open(".", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_LARGEFILE|O_DIRECTORY) = -1 ESTALE (Stale 
NFS file handle)
write(2, "ls: ", 4ls: )                     = 4
write(2, ".", 1.)                        = 1
write(2, ": Stale NFS file handle", 23: Stale NFS file handle) = 23
write(2, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
_exit(1)                                = ?
