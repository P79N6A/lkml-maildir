No matter how the legal situation looks like: do we *want* to support
drivers that use an API totally alien to Linux concepts?
Personally I feel that no matter if they are legal or not, we should not
cater to such drivers in the first place.  If it's trickier to use
Windows API-drivers under Linux than to write a native Linux driver,
big deal...  We don't want Windows-drivers.  We want native drivers.
