> You should also increase the COMMAND_LINE_SIZE.
Unlike the generic settings in init/main.c of MAX_INIT_ARGS and
MAX_INIT_ENV, the setting of COMMAND_LINE_SIZE is arch-specific, and on
many arch's already set to an ample value such as 512, 896 or 1024.
If you have a specific arch for which this value is too small
for your needs, you probably need to take that up with the
maintainers of that arch code.
