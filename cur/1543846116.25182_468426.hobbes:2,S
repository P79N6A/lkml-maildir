In get_vtg(), if VOLTAGE_FRAMEWORK is defined then
	ret = vtg_get_voltage(v);
is the first user. If VOLTAGE_FRAMEWORK is not defined, the first user is:
	ret = vtg_get_voltage(&vhandle);
Then "return ret;" follows. I cannot see a path where 
pre-initialisation of ret does anything useful. If someone removed the
#else part, the compiler would bark.

My bad, this was a mistake. If VOLTAGE_FRAMEWORK is not defined, ret 
must be initialised. (the compiler would have noticed this one :-)

for example, omap_pm_create_point() does this.
