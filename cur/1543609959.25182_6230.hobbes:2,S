Whereas "set" is simply set the named attribute value, creating the
attribute if need be, replacing the value if the attribute exists,
and then return success.
The man pages on AndreasG's site go into more detail, but decribe
the original interface which Al didn't like.  I haven't created an
updated man page yet, because I'm still not sure if this interface
is quite what Al was looking for either... (Al?)

A VFS flags parameter could allow an individual filesystem to extend
the semantics of the set operation in new ways by adding new flags -
I think Al wanted to avoid the possibility of that ever happening,
which seems fair enough.
cheers.
