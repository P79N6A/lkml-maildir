Huh - your floppy is working?
Mine does not (with 2.4.0pre10-test1 that is):
[Marvin:~#] dd if=/dev/fd0 |od -c |more
2880+0 records in
2880+0 records out
0000000  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0  \0

[Marvin:~#]
This floppy currently holds my MILO image so output is definitively wrong :-)
I also saw pure random data (fragments from libc etc.) on different runs.
AXPpci33 ev4 UP
