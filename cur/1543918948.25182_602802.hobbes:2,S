You don't need to install Fedora, just read the code! :-)
The bug is obvious and it's been explained thoroughly in this
thread.
When 'dev' is NULL in ip6_route_add() we need to figure out what
namespace and/or loopback device you want to use.
There is no reason to do an entire dist install to work on fixing this
bug, yikes!
