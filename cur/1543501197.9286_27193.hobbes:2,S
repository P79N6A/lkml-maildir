and again... 2.7.2.3 caused filesystem corruption on 2.2.9 and 2.2.10.
note that I have a full list of people who have sent me in private their
problems -- who can I send the results to ?
reinstalling 2.2.7 and doing heavy disk io ( swapping, mandb, updatedb,
news.daily and kernel makes for several hours) won't fail.
