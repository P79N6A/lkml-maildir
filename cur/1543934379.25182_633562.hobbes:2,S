To say that another way:
 "the code is functionally equivalent, EXCEPT IT ISN'T, and it's 
  known to be broken".
wouldn't you say my version is more honest and correct?
The old code did a per-command callback. The new one doesn't. The code was 
*supposed* to be equivalent, but it clearly isn't. Why argue the point?
And no, maybe it's not that REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC should be calling ->done, 
maybe it's that some REQ_TYPE_FS commands should *not* be calling ->done. 
Or maybe we somehow got the wrong ->done in the first place, because we 
now get it from a different source.
I don't know, but what I'm arguing (very strongly) against is this 
attitude of "we don't know what's wrong, but wë́'ll leave it broken because 
we can't be bothered to figure it out".
That is exactly what reverting is there for. It doesn't matter one *whit* 
if the new code is cleaner and prettier, if it doesn't work.
