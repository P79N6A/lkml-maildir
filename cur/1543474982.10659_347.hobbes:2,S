   All of them :-)
   With the current PCI code, users are not expected to change either the
base addresses or IRQs [4] and it doesn't make sense to change them by just
writing to the configuration space [1] -- remember [2] that kernel-visible
and bus-visible values of these quantities are often different. I plan
to add a new ioctl for /proc/bus/pci files which would allow to change
all such information, but it's probably a 2.3 issue [3].
				Have a nice fortnight
