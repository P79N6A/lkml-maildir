Here I'm not sure. I think that interrupts are enabled and processed
correctly BUT the process cannot be Preempted because there is some
lock held (every lock will increment the preemption count).
The mouse doesn't move because X cannot be executed...
A quick test you can do is to enable CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ and try with
"ALT + Stamp + B" when the system "freezes". If it reboots then
interrupts work  :)
