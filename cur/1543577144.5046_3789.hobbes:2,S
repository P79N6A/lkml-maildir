Umm... OK, the last argument is convincing. Thanks...
BTW, what was the reason behind doing preallocation for directories on
ext2_bread() level? We both buy ourselves an oddity in directory structure
(preallocated blocks become refered from the inode immediately and they
are beyond i_size) and get more complicated ext2_alloc_block(). What do
we win here?
