Subject: [2.6.13.4 patch] kernel/audit.c: changing audit loglevel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello folks,
Here's a (very simple) patch to change the loglevel of messages
produced by the audit facility.
I was getting sick of the console polution the default loglevel
(KERNEL_WARN) was producing; I investigated and found out that 
kernel/audit.c simply wasn't setting the loglevel of most messages,
so they were getting tagged with the default (KERNEL_WARN) in
kernel/printk.c
I know I could have set the default console logging level to KERN_ERR
or lower, but it seems much more reasonable to set the audit loglevel
to KERN_NOTICE instead.
I'm submiting this in hope it could be useful to someone else.
Please Cc: any comments to me directly (durval AT tmp DOT com DOT br).
Best regards,
