Heh, no, because it is _way_ too late for such a patch that hasn't been
tested in any trees, sorry.
2.6.25 is the earliest I'll take such a fix, and if it's really as
simple as you say, I'll consider it for the -stable releases for .24 if
needed.
But so far, we have a zillion patches floating around, claiming
different things, some with signed-off-bys and others without, so for
now, I'll just stick with Arjan's patch in -mm and see if anyone
complains about those releases...
