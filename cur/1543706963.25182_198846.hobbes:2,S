you might also want to have a look at the idea behind PTXdist (see
http://www.pengutronix.de/software/ptxdist_en.html
) which is also able
to build toolchains and do all the necessary tweaking, without building
a glibc (just only run 'make xchain-gccstage1' to get a compiler without
glibc). It follows the same approach for the patch repositories like Dan
and we are syncing heavily.
The whole toolchain building is a huge mess at the moment.
