Well, no.  For one thing all the iorl patches miss the scsi_assign_lock
interface from 2.6 which makes drivers a big ifdef hell (especially
as the AS2.1 patch uses a different name for the lock as 3.0), and even
if it was there the use of that function is strongly discuraged in 2.6
in favour of just using the host_lock.
