Subject: Poor NFS performance against FreeBSD server

Hello again,
I have tested iozone against a FreeBSD NFS server from my 2.2.9-ac4
clients. It shows very bad performance during NFS writes (around 80 Ko/s),
similar to the performance I have against our Solaris E450.
I think that the cause is similar, but I want to know if it is really
the case (NFS V2 clients against NFS V3 server, for example). And I
would like to avoid adding right now NFS V3 support in the kernel,
unless it is included in the main tree.
A+,
