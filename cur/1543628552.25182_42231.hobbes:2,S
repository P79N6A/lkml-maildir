But it doesn't! As previously stated, if you have a device on a common
'channel' (like IDE), that everybody else is trying to use, then
everybody else ends up waiting. However, if your errored devices don't
take over a common I/O channel, everybody else gets the CPU while the
errors are being retried.
For instance, I have SCSI for my disks, and I use IDE for a R/W CD
because it's cheap. I can "try forever" reading dorked CDs and the
only process affected at all is the one trying to read the CD. I
can do full-speed compiles while the CD is being retried.
It's all about configuration. The kernel drivers sleep while waiting
for interrupts that will determine the success or failure of the
disk operation. The 'sleep' means that the CPU gets given to somebody
who could use it.

The problem is that the hardware usually waits for the worse-case time
(disk spin-up time) to even report an error. It's not like you could
somehow wait for one rev of the disk to determine if a sector could
be read. The disk, itself, retries for a long time, then it reports
a rather general-purpose error (media error on SCSI, bad sector on
IDE, record not found, etc).

Put your CDs on a different controller and you can do anything you
want without affecting other tasks.
