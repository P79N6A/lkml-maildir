And I think that what was done to SLAB is excellent. But like code I've
written, I've often thought, if I rewrote it again, I would do it cleaner
since I learned so much in doing it.
So the only way that I can feel that I can actually improve the current
system, is to write one from scratch (or start with one that is simple)
and try to make it as good as the current system.  But by the time I got
it there, it would be just as complex as it is today.  So only then,  I
could rewrite it to be better, since I learned why things were done the
way they were, and can have that in my mind as I rewrite.  So that means
writing it twice!
Unfortunately, it is probably the case that those that wrote slab.c are
too busy doing other things (or probably just don't want to), to rewite
the slab.c with the prior knowledge of what they wrote.
For the short time, I could just force myself to study the code and play
with it to see what I break, and figure out "Oh, that's whay that was
done!".
