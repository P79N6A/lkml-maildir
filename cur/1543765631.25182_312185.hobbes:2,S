Fine, it may not be an important bug.

You should CC the ehci-hcd the usb-storage maintainers, they probably
will have more clues or ideas about what you encounter. A post to the
linux-usb-users list would be a good idea too. Also, if you can test
2.6 and find that it is broken only on 2.4, it will be easier for them
to send you some code to try.
