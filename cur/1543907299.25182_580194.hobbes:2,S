This patch set is for fixing SIGILL trouble in NFS by adding
sync_icache_dcache() before set_pte(). (see patches for detail)
Tested with my NUMA box and works well.
Chanves V6 -> V7
- dropped add-on patches for cpu family handling.
For this post, I wrote an easy test for this SIGILL/NFS problem.
Please verify.
This is my result.
