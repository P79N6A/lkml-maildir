[1]+1 says
Linux, Sun and other Non Windows Platforms
· Requires available USB port. Uses generic drivers provided by the operating 
system. Due to the heterogeneity in these platforms, we cannot guarantee 
compatibility with these systems. However, if your system can use any USB mouse 
and keyboard, it will probably work with a Savant or Savant Elite foot switch.
I guess it's ordinary input device without any special driver needs.
