hey, be cool :)
and eugene: there are some websites, which are able to help you -
normally much faster and better than any mailing-list can do. normally
the distributor has a database with supported hardware. if you
distributer has no database online have a look at websites from other
distributors, maybe:
http://hardwaredb.suse.de/?LANG=en_UK
http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/
or:
http://www.linuxhardware.org/
i think that you will finde an answer much faster, than anybody can
write an e-mail ;)
