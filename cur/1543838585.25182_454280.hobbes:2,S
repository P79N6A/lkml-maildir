It would be great if we could define:
#define page_is_real(p) (p->_count > 0 || p->flags != 0)
Hence mem_map[] would be automatically initialized as full of page without
any real memory instead of initializing it with a magic value.

I don't see the problem there. You can init mem_map[] each time it is
allocated with the magic value (if the above definition can't be used).
Then, as usual, archs free all zone area by initializing all mem_map
entries with something different from the magic value. After that all
entries of mem_map[] with the magic value can be fastly discarded
because they don't have real memory.
