Subject: Network Load Balance
There is any way to make 2 intel ethernet cards working as one, like the
Network Load Balance (NLB - Windows) in the Intel Ethernet adapters with
the Adaptive Load Balance feature on linux? 
I know that in windows it works, but in the linux? Anyone has any
ideias? 
Joao Reis.
