Subject: SOLVED (user error) -- ad1848.c compile problem in 2.3.50

My apologies, Niels and Christoph.  It was my error.
I had applied a patch given on Linux-Kernel
that was not part of the patch-2.3.50 patch.
I apparently missed the fact that part of the 
ad1848.c 2.3.50 patch was rejected.
Fixed now.
Onward,
	Miles
