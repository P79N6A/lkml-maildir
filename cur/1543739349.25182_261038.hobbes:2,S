There's a log of initialization that goes on between console_init() and
populate_rootfs().  However, console_init() will only initialize built-in
consoles (as pointed to by conswitchp) such as vgacon or dummycon.
However, the framebuffer system initialization does happen after
populate_rootfs().  
So, at least in the framebuffer perspective, the emulator/video boot may be
loaded as part of initramfs.
