Ok, with Christophs help I guess I know now what the question is :)
touch /mnt/B/somefile is doing a lookup in "B" for "somefile". Therefore it
locks B->i_mutex for that. When it gets a negative dentry it creates the
file.
mv /mnt/union/somedir /mnt/union/somefile is doing a lookup in "union" for
"somefile". Therefore it first locks the i_mutex of the topmost directory
in the union of "/mnt/union" (which happens to be "B"). When it gets a
negative dentry it than follows the union down to the next layer (with the
topmost directory still locked). Lookup is repeated until a filled dentry
is found or the topmost dentry negative dentry is used as a target for the
move. Thats it.
Did that answer your question?
Cheers,
Jan
