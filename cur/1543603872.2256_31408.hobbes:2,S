I have a problem with my sblive card with some program when I compile
2.4.10 and -ac8 for SMP.
This happens with programs from loki and the machine stops or power down
(yes an actuall power down). I'am sure this is sound related as stuff
works if I don't load the emu10k1 driver and it only happens with SMP.
