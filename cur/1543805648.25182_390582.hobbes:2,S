I don't want to push Peters patch to 2.6.16, as I haven't tested much.

Are we sure that it really fixes smp nice handling? Its not just one 
scenario(bouncing processes on a lightly loaded system), I am talking about. 
Imbalance calculations will be wrong even on a completely loaded system.. 
Are you sure that there are no perf regressions with your patch..
Sorry for commenting on this patch so late.. I was on a very long vacation.
I think it is safe to back that out for 2.6.16 and do more work and get it
in 2.6.17.
thanks,
