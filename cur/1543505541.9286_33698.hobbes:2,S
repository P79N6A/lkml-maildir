OK, thanks for that primer...
Have got /proc/memleak up and running and am seeing something like 
335000 calls to rtl8139.c:1229 (which is a call to dev_alloc_skb()) 
on the way to filling up memory.
I'll hazard a guess that Harri also is running an rtl8139 for his 
ethernet. True? (Something about SMP and the rtl8139 driver...)
Is there anything more I can do to pin this down further, or should I 
leave this to you and Donald Becker to figure out who is doing what 
to whom?
	Best,
		Frank Horowitz
