This will sometimes happen with the 8259A and really should not even
be logged. There is a default handler for all interrupts. If this
handler gets control from an unallocated interrupt, it writes this
message, ACKs the interrupt, then returns.

You are using a SMP kernel on a `386 UP machine. That tends to make
these burps show up. It is harmless, though.

This shows something I don't understand. Either the counter wrapped,
a timer is mis-programmed, or the CPU clock speed is about 1.5 MHz.
You should look into this. Older kernels generally show the BogoMIPS
as being about equal to the CPU clock speed +/- 20%. Newer kernels
generally show it being about 2 times the clock speed +/- 20%.

I have one of these too.
