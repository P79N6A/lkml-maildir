Yeah, 25s may be too frequent... What I meant is that the old behavior
could be "write 1-3 inodes on every 5s" if the inodes are dirtied at
random times. Now it becomes "write 10 inodes on every 25s". So it is
actually better ;-)
It's interesting that we want writeback to be smooth on heavy loads
and to be 'bursty' on light loads. Increasing dirty_expire_centisecs
and decreasing dirty_writeback_centisecs could help it somehow.
