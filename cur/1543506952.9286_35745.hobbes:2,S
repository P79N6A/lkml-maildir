Thansk! This patch indeed fixes the problem where both sym53c8xx and ncr53c8xx
wanted to play with the same SCSI adapter.
However, now a different problem showed up (with vger-August 24/2.3.15-preXX
on PPC):
| sym53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 6, function 0
| sym53c8xx: setting PCI_COMMAND_IO PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY...
| sym53c8xx: setting PCI_COMMAND_MASTER PCI_COMMAND_PARITY...(fix-up)

| ncr53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 6, function 0
| ncr53c8xx: IO region 0x1400 to 0x147f is in use

| scsi1 : MESH
| scsi : 2 hosts.
| scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 0, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 Test Unit Ready 00 00 00 00 00 
| sym53c8xx_abort: pid=0 serial_number=1 serial_number_at_timeout=1
And then the system hangs in a wait loop...
My devices (from 2.3.6 dmesg):

The last kernel that worked on my machine (CHRP LongTrail) was 2.3.10 (a bit
unstable), but I'm using 2.3.6 right now since it's more stable.
Any clues?
