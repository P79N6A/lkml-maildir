You are correct, it definitely depends upon the workload, and a lot of the 
benchmarks do use Windows; however, I will have to check later, I recall 
finding a few that did test under Linux.
For a plain untar with lots of small files, the benefit is not as big as 
sequential reads/writes of big files; however, there is still an 
improvement:
Raid5 Quad 150 Raptor (NCQ)
# time sh -c 'tar xf linux-2.6.20.tar; sync'
real    0m21.721s
user    0m0.174s
sys     0m1.541s
Raid5 Quad 150 Raptor (NO NCQ)
# time sh -c 'tar xf linux-2.6.20.tar; sync'
real    0m16.761s
user    0m0.195s
sys     0m1.361s
Raid5 Six 400GB Sata Drives (NO NCQ)
# time sh -c 'tar xf linux-2.6.20.tar; sync'
real    0m54.844s
user    0m0.189s
sys     0m1.432s
Raid5 Six 400GB Sata Drives (NCQ)
# time sh -c 'tar xf linux-2.6.20.tar; sync'
real    1m7.322s
user    0m0.194s
sys     0m1.492s
