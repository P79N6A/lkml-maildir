IA64 inherits this part of the architecture from x86, so no magic fix.
This is a fundamentally a chipset limitation, not an architectural bug.
rev-E amd64 cpus from AMD all have memory hoisting support,
as do all server chipsets from Intel for the last several years.
To avoid this you just need a good chipset and a good BIOS implementation.
Any recent server board should be fine.  Hopefully the desktop boards
will catch up soon.
