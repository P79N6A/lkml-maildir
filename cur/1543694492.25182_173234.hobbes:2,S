Well, the box is still fine useable, but it's only rebooted some days
ago. However, I see size-64 (non-DMA) is going sloooowly up... What do I
do with the box? minicom (it's kind of a console server:), NATting, IPv6
gw. No X11, normally no local access at all.
On my Athlon (dual), I've already reached 319780 allocations in size-64,
but it seems to be currently stable, though...
I do _not_ see a leak in he size-4k region.
