Right - in the ppc case, I don't ever need to bounce a lowmem page, so  
I wasn't taking that into account.  But what you suggest makes sense.

Yeah, it still needs a bit of clean-up.... I need to scrub for stuff  
like this. That loop changed a few times and I hacked it into working  
and haven't cleaned it up yet.
Thanks for taking a look!  Given how similar the two patches are, it's  
pretty clear that we're either both insane, or both headed in the  
right direction :)
Anyway, I'm about to turn into a pumpkin - I'll probably be online for  
another hour or so sometime this afternoon, and then that's it for me  
until after I get back from vacation.  My apologies again for  
disappearing in the middle of the fun.
Cheers,
