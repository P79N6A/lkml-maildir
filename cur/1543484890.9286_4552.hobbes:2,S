What makes you think there was a consensus?
You heard some arguments that agreed with your own erroneous thoughts,
and you saw the thread die off. That does not mean that the rest of
the world now agrees with you.
Hmmm, maybe lpd should access the parallel port hardware directly?
No, I like kernel drivers. If I wanted to run DOS, I'd run DOS.
DOS with Windows 3.1 is not a design we should copy.
