Whan I write in a NFS mounted filesystem, after a few seconds I keep on
getting these messages:
tulip.c: outl_CSR6 too many attempts,csr5=0x60218140
A few moments later the eth interface stops working.
The only way to reactivate the network interface is:
ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0 && ifconfig eth0 -promisc
Any hints?
