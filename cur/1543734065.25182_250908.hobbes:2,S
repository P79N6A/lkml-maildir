Yup, I'm studing this issue.
But while looking at code I found this interesting place:
__writeback_single_inode()
{
         while (inode->i_state & I_LOCK) {
                 __iget(inode);			<<<<<<
                 spin_unlock(&inode_lock);
                 __wait_on_inode(inode);
                 iput(inode);			<<<<<<
                 spin_lock(&inode_lock);
        }
	return __sync_single_inode(inode, wbc); <<<<<<
}
the problem here is iget/iput.
There are 2 possible cases:
1. all callers of this function do hold reference on inode, then 
iget/iput is unneeded.
2. if 1) is incorrect then it's a bug, since inode is used after iput.
This place looks really ugly, or I don't understand something here?
