Subject: Re: [PATCH] wireless-2.6 zd1211rw check against regulatory domain rather than hardcoded value of 11

The patch was based off the FIXME comment in the code [which suggested
replacing 11 with the boundary for the regulatory domain]. I'll take a
look at the vendors driver and see about modifying the patch to fit
more with its logic or just limmiting it to the FCC regulatory domain.
