I didn't try 2.6.23, which I think has bigger problems due to new
CFS code. 2.6.25-rc fixes that, but yes in general I think the MySQL
performance profile is worse on later kernels: while it has a
very slightly higher peak performance, it drops off in performance
more quickly after that peak. I initially wasn't too worried about
it, but seeing as postgresql has a similar problem, I've made the
scheduler developers aware of it.
