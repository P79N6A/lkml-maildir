So it will be duplicated in allmost every architecture ?

This function implemented differently in allmost every architecture.
I beleive that most of them can use generic version, but I'm still not sure.
v850 and mips define synchronize_irq() as barrier() for example.

IIRC v850 architecture doesn't need it at all.

Some architectures provide empty stubs for these functions.
I'm not sure about CONFIG_ISA, IMHO any legacy device driver
can use irq autoprobing.
