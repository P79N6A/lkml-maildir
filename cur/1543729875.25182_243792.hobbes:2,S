On several architectures (most notably s390, but also IPF and PPC) the
load generated by hotplug during boot can in actual practice become
quite high. The bus scans can generate events of the order of 100 to
1000.
These machines are more I/O-focused and handle many devices in parallel.
So having a quick and lean hotplug becomes very desirable.
Since these machines also tend to be used in HA situations, problem
recovery time and therefore reboot time becomes an essential factor to
decrease periods of unavailability.
