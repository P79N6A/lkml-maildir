I'm going to assume that the #error here:
+#ifdef CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE
+#error
+       stop_trace();
+#endif
is to see if I'm awake.  No, but gcc is.  I just removed it (?).
End result is as with the previous patch: nothing to serial console,
and just the single line moaning about line 471 in blah blah blah.
