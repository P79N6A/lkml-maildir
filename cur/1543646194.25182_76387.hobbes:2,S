Now that the Linux kernel is once again able to run all the tests we
have and since glibc 2.3 was released it was time for a new code drop.
I've uploaded the second code drop for the Native POSIX Thread
Library:
  
ftp://people.redhat.com/drepper/nptl/nptl-0.2.tar.bz2
You need
- - the latest of Linus' kernel from BitKeeper (or 2.5.41 when it
  is released);
- - glibc 2.3
- - the very latest in tools such as
  + gcc either from the current development branch or the gcc 3.2
    from Red Hat Linux 8;
  + binutils preferrably from CVS, from H.J. Lu's latest release for
    Linux, or from RHL 8.
Compiling glibc should proceed smoothly.  But there are a number of
tests which fail, mostly because some functionality is missing in
glibc.  Ignore those errors.  It is only important that all tests in
nptl/ are passing.  Run
  make subdirs=nptl check
to run all thread tests.
This version features several improvements:
- - all APIs are now implemented;
- - fork handling has been improved; stacks in the child are freed;
  atfork handlers are removed if they were registered from a module
  which gets unloaded.
- - pthread_tryjoin_np and pthread_timedjoin_np are implemented
- - TSD handling corrected and optimized.
- - many more tests which also test the underlying kernel implementation.
- - the build infrastructure has been implemented so that the DSO and
  archives are built in usable form and with correct named.
- - libthread_db has been implemented.  This is the library which is
  needed by all program which need to get access to internals of
  libpthread (mainly debuggers).
- - the CPU clock functions are implemented
The white paper hasn't yet been updated.  It's still available at
  
http://people.redhat.com/drepper/nptl-design.pdf
This release should be ready for some serious testing.  I know it is
hard to compile which I why I'm looking into providing binary RPMs.
They can be used on non-critical systems.  I'll only be able to
provide binaries for RHL8 based systems, though, and the kernel still
must be installed separately.
The next steps will include:
- - write more tests and fix the bugs which are discovered this way
- - update the white paper
- - write and run more performance tests
- - port to IA-64
