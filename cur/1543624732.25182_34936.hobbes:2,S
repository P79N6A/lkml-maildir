Yes, you are right for this one.
But what impressed me is between Host2/Host3. One is a dual-866 with 
2.4.16 and the other is mono-800 with 2.2.19. And the host3 with 2.2.19 
is ~7% better than Host2 (Not counting that Host3 has ~8% more CPU 
clock, which should have be ~15% better for Host2 vs Host3...)

But that's just what I'd like to see. How 2.4 compares vs 2.2
