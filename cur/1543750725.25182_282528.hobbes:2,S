We should have both node and cpus here because both
are needed in user space (one for CPU affinity, the other
for memory affinity). While it's possible to convert
in user space it's quite cumbersome. 
I plan to add functions to libnuma to make this easy,
but I'm not sure everybody will want to use libnuma just
for this.

I'm not sure what that is anyways. I don't think x86-64 sets it up
and does anybody really use it?

I suspect it's already too late.

I'm not sure how useful that would be anyways.

You mean a nodemask?

You mean the user space interface?
Getting it from sysfs will be always a mess, best is to have a standard
library that offers this in nice functions and a command whose output
can be parsed by shell scripts. I plan to add this eventually to 
numactl/libnuma.
