Hello Frank
   Here is the "pseudo code" for the program
   create 4 files of different sizes.Then wrote a program , as below:
     while ( for arbitrary time)
     {
           fopen (  first file )
           mmap (  first file )
           Note the memory-size of process
          munmap ( the file)
          Note the memory-size of process again
          fclose ( first file)
    
         //Repeat the above Sequence for 2nd File
         //Repeat the above Sequence for 3rd File
         //Repeat the above Sequence for 4th File
    }
  Full code is here :
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <iostream.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <errno.h>
#define MEM_MULTIPLIER 1

Please post a short program which demos the problem on LKML. This is
the only way to get help from the kernel developers to track down
the problem.
