Ah, so you might also have discovered a few annoyances with the API, eg
the fact that splice() returns after the first read in non-blocking mode,
as well as the fact that it never returns zero on close, but -EAGAIN,
which requires an additional recv(MSG_PEEK) to distinguish between a
close and a lack of data. But I leave that for a later discussion, let's
address the corruption issue first.

I confirm your observations. Benchmarks were OK, it's the first user of
my experimental code who reported wrong md5sums on their ISO images :-/
For this reason, I think that it's completely related to the way pages
are passed between sockets, but I'm too much a loser in this area. I
understood tcp_splice_read(), but can't manage to find what is called
on the other side nor what the data become :-(

That's nice, because I'd like to ensure that whatever fix is proposed
is properly validated, not only on my platforms!
