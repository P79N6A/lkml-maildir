So it wrote .5GB of memory in seven seconds, or started with .5GB of RAM
in use?
If we want to compare apples with apples, we're going to have to make
the only difference which code is run. A normal load on my computer is
evolution, cyrus imapd, opera, win4lin running Libronix and a kernel
tree in the cache (last image sizes were 1000, 1002, 995, 949 and
910MB). I'm happy to run your sped-up code for some tests, if you'd
like. You know where to find mine if you want to make sure I'm not
cheating :>

You'll be able to do that within limits, but once you do seriously given
up on the max-half-of-memory limit, you'll need some major redesigning.
If that's the way you want to go, okay. Assuming nothing else changes,
I'll just keep suspend2 alive outside of the kernel tree until you get
sick of users asking, and continue to enhance it.

I'm not taking it personally at all. I did find some of the objections
pretty petty and some of the comparisons grossly unfair, but I'm not
taking it personally.
