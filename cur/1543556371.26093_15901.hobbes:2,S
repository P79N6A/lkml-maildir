The bzdisk code is used so infrequently compared to the normal
bootloaders, lilo, grub, and syslinux, that I'm not surprised it has
problems with many edge cases.
Although I imagine this is an unpopular opinion, I think that we
should remove all bzdisk-type code from X86...	syslinux and other
boot loaders handle weird BIOS quirks much better, simply because
they are used in far more situations than bzdisk.
syslinux especially is quite nice for loading kernels from floppy.
It's very small, and "syslinux -s" adds in some wonderfully-paranoid
sanity checks which make boot loading works on many a quirky BIOS.
(don't use '-s' unless you need it, of course, it slows things down...)
