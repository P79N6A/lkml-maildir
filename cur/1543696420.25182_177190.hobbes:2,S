No, I didn't instrument it.  But profiling showed that it was working as
desired.  The workload was tons of disk I/O, showing significant CPU time
in the page lock/unlock functions.
It would be neater to remove the task from the list _before_ waking it up. 
The current code in there is careful to only remove the task if the wakeup
attempt was successful, but I have a feeling that this is unnecessary - the
waiting task will do the right thing.  One would need to think about that a
bit more.

Is it not the case that ia32's reschedule IPI is async?  If the
architecture's reschedule uses a synchronous IPI then it could indeed be
the case that the woken CPU gets there first.

Instrumentation on other architectures would be interesting.
