This patch and the ext2 patch (23/23) are accomplishing the same thing in 2 
different ways, I think, and introducing unnecessary differences between ext2 
and ext3.  I'd personally prefer to see both ext2 and ext3 handled with the 
get_dentry op addition, and I'd be happy to quickly whip up the ext3 patch to do 
this if there's agreement on this path.
(there's nothing technically wrong with either approach, it just seems 
inconsistent to me).
Thanks,
-Eric
