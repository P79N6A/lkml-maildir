I would prefer to have the binary blob available; exported fields is 
possible too, of course.
This is a binary structure defined by protocol; in that way it's not 
significantly different from something passed from the firmware (in 
fact, it might very well *be* passed from the firmware.)  We have in the 
past found platform bugs by looking at the contents of the whole 
structure, e.g. to find that part of it has been inappropriately clobbered.
It is also in the form needed by e.g. kexec to operate.
