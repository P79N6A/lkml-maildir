With 2.4.22pre10-ac1 the SATA part of the ICH5 is no longer
found or recognized. With a plain 2.4.22pre3 (last 2.4.22pre I tested)
it was working properly.
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00beta4-2.4
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
ICH5: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:1f.1
PCI: Enabling device 00:1f.1 (0005 -> 0007)
ICH5: chipset revision 2
ICH5: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xfc00-0xfc07, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xfc08-0xfc0f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: WDC WD1200JB-00EVA0, ATA DISK drive
blk: queue c033ab60, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
hdc: Pioneer DVD-ROM ATAPIModel DVD-106S 012, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: attached ide-disk driver.
hda: host protected area => 1
hda: 234441648 sectors (120034 MB) w/8192KiB Cache, CHS=14593/255/63,
UDMA(100)
I am not sure if this was reported already.
Greetings,
Jurgen
