However, note the modifications of task->flags are not atomic. In
principle, one may have:
__alloc_pages()			__oom_kill_task()
load current->flags		load current->flags
|= PF_MEMALLOC in registers	|= PF_MEMALLOC|PF_MEMDIE in registers
IRQ/delay/whatever		store current->flags
store current->flags		...
try_to_free_pages() etc.	force_sig() etc.
... and voila! PF_MEMDIE in ->flags has been lost.
