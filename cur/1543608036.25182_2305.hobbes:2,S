You can get patches from:
ftp://ftp.mandrakesoft.com/pub/quintela/
for 2.4.8-ac12, I have patches for more recent kernel, but they are
still not there.  I expect to put there tomorrow of the following day.
Any comments, suggestions are welcome.  I am in the middle of trying
ot get _some_ sane lock to supermount, as the beast basically don't
have any look at the moment, normally works due to de the fact that
normally there are not one hundred concurrent users of the floppy or
cd :(
Later, Juan.
