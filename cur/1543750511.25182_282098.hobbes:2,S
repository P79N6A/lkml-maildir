Ok, I'm nitpicking here, but why int and not short? are we likely to ever
want to wait for more than 2 minutes? and if we want to wait ~3min, then
unsigned short should do just fine (and unsigned would even be logical
since negative retry value doesn't make any sense)....

I think if  (tryagain--)  makes more sense. You set tryagain to 20 thereby 
implying that we will be doing 20 retries, but with --tryagain we will 
only be doing 19 retries, not 20 - with tryagain-- we will be doing the 
nr. of retries that we initially initialize 'tryagain' to.
other than that (and it /is/ nitpicking) the patch looks good to me.
