After thinking about this a bit more, I think we should keep the GEODEGX1
define because it was for a different core, but consolidate the GX and LX
defines into a single define.  Originally, we added the defines for
ease-of-use in the configuration realm, for example, not allowing the user to
build the LX TRNG for a GX kernel.  Based on the other comments regarding
similar things, I now think that we should avoid it all together.
I'm going to keep the GEODE_LX define, and send GEODE_GX to the briny deep.
I guess technically, we could use the codename for the core, but I think
that would be more confusing.  Best to stick with the marketing names, I think.

I'll remove the defines for now until we can prove that its better to have 
them turned on.
Thanks for your comments,
