Are you sure?  Without the always_inline stuff we were seeing 100 different
copies of __constant_c_and_count_memset and friends in the vmlinux symbol
table.  It was really silly.
After applying this patch and building with gcc-3.4, how does `size
vmlinux' compare with the same kernel built with gcc-3.3, minus the patch?
