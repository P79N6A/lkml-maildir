And el-torito bootable CDs basically glue a floppy image onto the front of 
the CD and lie to the bios to say "oh yeah, I'm a floppy, boot from me".  
Luckily, they can use the old 2.88 "extended density" floppy standard IBM 
tried to launch years ago which never got anywhere, but which most BIOS's 
recognize.  But that's still a fairly small place to try to stick a whole 
system...
