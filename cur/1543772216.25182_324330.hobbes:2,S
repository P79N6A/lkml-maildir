gcc-4.0.0 vanilla is broken and miscompiles some ipv4/sysctl stuff.
More recent 4.0.1 snapshots are OK.
I've been using gcc4 for 2.6 and 2.4 kernels since late January,
for both desktops and servers, and for i386/x86-64/ppc/ppc64.
Recent 2.6 kernels should work as-is, except perhaps in poorly
maintained drivers. The 2.4 kernels need fair amounts of patching,
99% of which is to prevent compile-time errors. These patches
are not yet merged into the standard 2.4 tree and may never be.
