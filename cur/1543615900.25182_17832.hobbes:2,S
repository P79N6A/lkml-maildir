the above code will end marking uptodate (zeroed) buffers relative to
blocks that cannot be read from disk. So a read-retry won't hit the disk
and that's wrong.
I think that will be fixed by additionally also return -EIO in the
wait_on_buffer loop (instead of goto out), so we won't generate zeroed
uptodate cache in case of read failure.
