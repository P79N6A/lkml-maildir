Hi,
Just a thought..
How about consider this change for 2.6 kernel series at this point, and 
don't backport it 2.4 at least first and/or make the behaviour 
configurable?
Upgrading from 2.4 to 2.6 should be a step big enough that folks should 
revisit their more advanced configurations, causing smaller surprises.  
Changing the behaviour inside 2.4.x series might not be reasonable.
