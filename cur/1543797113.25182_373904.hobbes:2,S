I'm not scared, just not liking this patch series at all.
In the end, it's just moving from one locking scheme to another.  No big
deal.
The problem is, none of this should be needed at all.  We need to move
the usb-serial drivers over to use the serial core code.  If that
happens, then none of this locking is needed.
That's the right thing to do, so I'm not going to take this patch series
right now because of that.  If you all want to work on moving to use the
serial core, I would love to see that happen.
thanks,
greg k-h
