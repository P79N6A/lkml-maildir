that should not be possible (except on SMP where there might be a window).
You are not running SMP, right? The TIMER_BH is run right when the IRQ
handler returns to non-irq context (which might be user-space or kernel
space), so it's not possible to 'lose' a TIMER_BH event due to some task
running. BHs might get delayed due to interrupts though, so you might want
to profile how long various interrupt sources execute.
