This does look like a problem with the e100. I have a SMP machine and
another machine with a e100 card, but not the both together, and I'm not
about to start pulling cards.  Does this only happen in SMP or do you
also see this problem running a UP kernel (you only need to run a UP
kernel on SMP machine to get the same results)? I'm running debian but I
guess I could run the Fedora kernel to see if I can get the same
behavior.

So you have something locking up momentarily, then coming back to
normal?  After the rmmod of e100 and bringing back up the network, all
is in order?  Just confirming what you see.

Did you add that patch yourself, or did it come with an update?  I was
just fiddling with rpms and I can use them too, with the rpm2cpio, it
works nice.  So if you can just point to a link then I'll download it
and try it out.  I found
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/updates/testing/4/i386/kernel-smp-2.6.12-1.1411_FC4.i686.rpm
but this is to 1411 and not to what you showed (1455).
