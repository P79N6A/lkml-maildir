I can't understand why should we change ->exit_signal if we want to
use signalfd. Yes, SIGCHLD is not rt. So what?
We do not need multiple signals in queue if we want to reap multiple
zombies. Once we have a single SIGCHLD (reported by signalfd or
whatever) we can do do_wait(WNOHANG) in a loop.
Confused.
