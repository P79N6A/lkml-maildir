Hmmm, could you help me with drawing up a selection algorithm
on how to choose which SHM segment to destroy when we run OOM?
The criteria would be about the same as with normal programs:
1) minimise the amount of work lost
2) try to protect 'innocent' stuff
3) try to kill only one thing
4) don't surprise the user, but chose something that
   the user will expect to be killed/destroyed
