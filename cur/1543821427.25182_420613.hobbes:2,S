How does this look?
I am pretty horrible when it comes to Documentation,
but this seems to be the essence of what I was saying earlier.

+What is an IRQ?
+
+An IRQ is an interrupt request from a device.
+Currently they can come in over a pin, or over a packet.
+IRQs at the source can be shared.
+
+An IRQ number is a kernel identifier used to talk about a hardware
+interrupt source.  Typically this is an index into the global irq_desc
+array, but except for what linux/interrupt.h implements the details
+are architecture specific.
+
+An IRQ number is an enumeration of the possible interrupt sources on a
+machine.  Typically what is enumerated is the number of input pins on
+all of the interrupt controller in the system.  In the case of ISA
+what is enumerated are the 16 input pins to the pair of i8259
+interrupt controllers.
+
+Architectures can assign additional meaning to the IRQ numbers, and
+are encouraged to in the case  where there is any manual configuration
+of the hardware involved.  The ISA IRQ case on x86 where anyone who
+has been around a while can tell you how the first 16 IRQs map to the
+input pins on a pair of i8259s is the classic example.
