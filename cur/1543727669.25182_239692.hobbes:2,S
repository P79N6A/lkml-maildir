You wanted to get a description in 'a few words' - this cannot be done.
.... So I instucted you how to get the full desciption. 
You may of course look yourself for the documentation at docs.sun.com.......
It seems that you are not really interested to understand how it works :-(
If you behave this way, I tend to believe that you have a precasted opinion 
that you are not willing to change.
