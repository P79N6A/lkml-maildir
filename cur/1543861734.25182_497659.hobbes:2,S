FWIW, the patch does apply fine (at least the first one, which is needed) :
tnt@hitomi linux-2.6-mpc52xx-new $ patch -p1 --dry-run <
ohci-rework-bus-glue-integration-to-allow-several-at-once.patch

The offset in ohci-pci.c is harmless.
But maybe the question we should ask is why would it build
drivers/usb/host/ohci-ppc-soc.c for an iMac G3 ... Because that problem
(ohci multiple glue in module) is there since a long time, just never
spotted before.
arch/powerpc/KConfig :
config PPC_EFIKA
        bool "bPlan Efika 5k2. MPC5200B based computer"
        depends on PPC_MULTIPLATFORM && PPC32
        select PPC_RTAS
        select RTAS_PROC
        select PPC_MPC52xx
        select PPC_NATIVE
        default y
               ^^^
This was added by commit
c37858d333a50815c74349396e31a535f4128e0b on Nov5.
and a patch to correct that has been submitted recently :
