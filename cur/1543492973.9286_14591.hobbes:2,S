What the hell? I mark the executable with what it needs:
$ mark-min-cap a.out CAP_CHOWN CAP_NET_ADMIN
I then run the executable. If the capability calculation does not
give the process CAP_CHOWN and CAP_NET_ADMIN, execution fails.
This is really basic bit operations and bit testing, like this:
new_pP = old_fP | (old_fI & old_pI);
if(min_pP & ~new_pP) return -EPERM;
