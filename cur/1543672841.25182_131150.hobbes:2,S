I'm using kernel 2.5.69-bk3 with this recent test. Booted with noapic, 
and I get thousands of lines of APIC errors. I still get the 'bulk_msg: 
timeout' with USB though.
This hasn't ever worked for me. First tried with 2.5.54. I don't think I 
tried 2.5.68. Should I and see if it was something in a patch to 2.5.69?
Thanks,
David
