CPU caches are really big nowadays

cpu prefetch isn't going to be fast enough. It helps some, but in the
end the cpu prefetch also has to wait for the ram, it doesn't make the
ram faster or free, it just takes a jumpstart on getting to it.

It is. It's good proof that you can make a big gain already by
converting a few key places to his excellent code. And neither me nor
Christoph are suggesting to ditch his effort! Instead we suggest that
what he is doing is useful for some cases and harmful for others, and
that it is quite easy to identify those cases and separate them from
eachother, and that thus as a result it is more optimal to have 2 apis,
one for each of the cases.
