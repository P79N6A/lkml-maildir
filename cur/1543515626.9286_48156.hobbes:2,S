Hi !
I am experiencing random crashes of egcs while compiling the kernel
on a redhat 6.0 alpha system.
here is a sample output from make (this one is particulary interesting,
other don't print such interesting messages :-)):
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/tmp/stein/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing
-pipe -mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8 -mcpu=ev5 -Wa,-mev6   -c -o timer.o timer.c
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/tmp/stein/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing
-pipe -mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8 -mcpu=ev5 -Wa,-mev6   -c -o protocol.o protocol.c
Usage: ld.so [OPTION]... EXECUTABLE-FILE [ARGS-FOR-PROGRAM...]
You have invoked `ld.so', the helper program for shared library executables.
This program usually lives in the file `/lib/ld.so', and special directives
in executable files using ELF shared libraries tell the system's program
loader to load the helper program from this file.  This helper program loads
the shared libraries needed by the program executable, prepares the program
to run, and runs it.  You may invoke this helper program directly from the
command line to load and run an ELF executable file; this is like execu
that file itself, but always uses this helper program from the file yo
specified, instead of the helper program file specified in the executable
file you run.  This is mostly of use for maintainers to test new versions
of this helper program; chances are you did not intend to run this program.
  --list                list all dependencies and how they are resolvedrify
              verify that given object
              really is a dynamically linkd
                        object we get handle
  --library-path PATH   use given PATH instead of content of the environment
                        variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  --inhibit-rpath LIST  ignore RPATH information in object names in LIST

the crashes are really random, happen at different places everytime,
or don't happen at all.
Is this a known problem ?
