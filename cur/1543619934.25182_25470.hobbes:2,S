Seeing the new scheduler in 2.4 would be nice!  However, soon wouldn't be nice, because there are a lot of 3rd party kernel 
modules that try to make calls against the old scheduler that don't seem to work.  My personal case in point is Bestcrypt 
( www.jetico.sci.fi ).  Just my thoughts on the matter.
