Sorry. I checked. switching PIT off really breaks nmi_watchdog=1, as
this just mirrors IRQ#0 to the NMI. No IRQ#0 from PIT, no NMI
We could keep PIT running with an empty interrupt handler when
nmi_watchdog=1 is set, but this interferes nicely with broadcasting.
Does nmi_watchdog=2 work ? We might switch to that, when a local APIC is
available.
