Subject: [BK PATCH] More i2c driver fixes for 2.6.0-test2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are some more i2c driver fixes for 2.6.0-test2.  They include a fix
for the driver model code (no release function, so easy oopses could
happen by users), and removing usage of the struct device.name field as
that is about to go away.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/i2c-2.5
thanks,
