UDF "Development Status" remains "5 - Production/Stable" but includes
the following new issues, now recorded at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-udf
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=295&atid=100295
To fix these we need volunteers able to write patches, of course. 
People with less expertise can work to make any of these more plainly
reproducible, e.g. by writing a demo test script.
