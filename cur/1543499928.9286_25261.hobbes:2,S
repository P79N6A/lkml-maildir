	Check also leaking mmap() regions; each one is associated to some
	file descriptor, which may not be (anymore) in the process fd set!
		cat /proc/[pid]/maps
	I encountered apparent bug in opening of BSD DB 2.* B_TREE (and
	possibly B_HASH) which leak one mmap() region on tmpfile() per
	each database open...  (glibc 2.1.1 as at RedHat 6.0)
