I think there's a few too many assumptions in that - are you thinking
of a big r/w shmem application? There's lots of other application
programming models that wouldn't suffer nearly so much ... but maybe
they're more splittable ... there's lots of things we can do to ensure
at least better than average node-locality for most of the memory.
