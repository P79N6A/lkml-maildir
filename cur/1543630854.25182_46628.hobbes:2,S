1) Returning 0 on success, and -errno on error is a common kernel
   convention.
2) Following kernel conventions makes it easier for other programmers
   to use your code.
3) You should only violate kernel conventions when there is a
   compelling reason.
	1a) If you're going to break a convention, do it in a way that
	    breaks compile, or 
	1b) If you can't do that, make it reliably break at runtime.
4) The single case which requires this information can be fixed by a
   simple 10-line wrapper function.
I do not believe this is a compelling reason to violate kernel
convention in a way which is almost impossible to notice.  I furthur
believe that it speaks very poorly about the thought put into kernel
interface design.

Try looking at intermezzo, or the s390 and s390x ports.  New code, new
coders, same trap.
