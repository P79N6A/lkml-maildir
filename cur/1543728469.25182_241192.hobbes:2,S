OK, leave it on until you sort out the stability problem. When we look
at performance problem, we'll probably start with highmem off.
I'll try to reproduce it here, but my highmem system has 4GB and is
allergic to mem=

We can look at deltas on some /proc/vmstat fields like pgpgin, slab_scanned,
pgalloc_dma etc. before and after the kbuild. Look at those deltas before
and after Linus' patch, and see if we can work out what is going on.

Well make sure it is stable first, then get back to me when you're ready
to tackle the performance problem. Thanks.
