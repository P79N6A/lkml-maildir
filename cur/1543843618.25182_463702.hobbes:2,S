If I try to develop your idea a little further, we could this of dividing the
tracing problem into four layers :
- tracepoints (where the code is instrumented)
  - identifying code
  - accessing data surrounding the code
- tracing backend (how to add the tracepoints)
- tracing infrastructure (what code will serialize the information)
- data extraction (getting the data out to disk, network, ...)
I think that, if we agree on this segmentation of the problem, this thread is
generally debating on the tracing backends and their respective limitations.
I just want to point out that the patch I have submitted adresses mainly the
"tracing infrastructure" and "data extraction" topics.

Mathieu
