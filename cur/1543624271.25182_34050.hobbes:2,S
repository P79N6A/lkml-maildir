hi there,
Does anybody know if these features have been implemented yet for the
PXA250?  Does anyone plan on developing these features in the next few
months?
        MMC/SD,
        IrDA,
        USB client
I am interested in any info on source, or modifications to existing
StrongArm source to support these features.
