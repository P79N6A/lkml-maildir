That is only one of ways of notifying userspace of system call completion
on OpenVMS. Pretty much every syscall there exists in 2 flavors - async
and sync, for example $QIO and $QIOW or $ENQ/$ENQW (actually -W flavor
is async call + $SYNCH to wait for completion). Once system service call
is completed the OS would raise a so-called event flag and may also
deliver an AST to the process. Application may either wait for an
event flag/set of event flags (EFN) or rely on AST to get notification.
