We not only limited bkbits.net to a fixed rate, we limited all TCP based
traffic to a fixed rate and it still didn't work.
I'm pretty convinced we can't solve the problem at our end.  Maybe we can
but I'm voting for throwing another T1 at the problem, we'll try working
with the ISP suggested solution of trunking them and rate limiting at
their end and if that doesn't work then we'll split them and use one for
bkbits.net and other bitmover related TCP traffic and use the other one
for phones.
