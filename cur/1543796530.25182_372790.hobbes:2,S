What are we breaking that people are complaining so much about?
Specifics please.
And if you bring up udev, please see my previous comments in this thread
about that issue.
It isn't userspace stuff that is breaking, as applications built on 2.2
still work just fine here on 2.6 for me.
Yes we break in-kernel apis, all the time, that's fine.  See
Documentation/stable-api-nonsense.txt for details about why we do that.
So again, specifics please?
thanks,
greg k-h
