they are?

quite certain of the clash.  disabling ppp or irda deflate makes things all
better.
the problem is that the zlib.c and zlib.h files are locally included in both
drivers.  both ppp and irda do a #include "../../blah/zlib.h" and zlib.c
rather than #include <zlib.h>.
we seem to have a splattering of zlib files:
nifty:/usr/src/linux# find -name "*zlib*"
./fs/cramfs/inflate/zlib.h
./drivers/net/zlib.c
./drivers/net/zlib.h
./arch/ppc/coffboot/zlib.c
./arch/ppc/coffboot/zlib.h
-d
