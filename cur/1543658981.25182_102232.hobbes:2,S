Subject: [patch] net/irda compile warnings in 2.4.21-pre3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I have fixed the compile warnings in net/irda that happened because of 
GCC's deprication of the concentenation of string literals with 
__FUNCTION__.
Tested on my tree. This my first patch, if it's not in optimal format, I 
apologize.
The patch is at 
http://www.chainsaw.cistron.nl/compile-fixes-irda.patch.gz
It should apply cleanly to vanilla 2.4.21-pre3 sources.
Tony.
