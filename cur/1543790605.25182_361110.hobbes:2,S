I don't need any weird combinations to produce this message - it
appears quite often when hitting keys to wake it up from sleep
mode (which it has an eager desire to be in when it's used in

I don't care how many occur or even that they do occur.  That's not
to say someone else doesn't.  But if there is someone else who does
care, maybe they should speak up and produce a patch to add whatever
