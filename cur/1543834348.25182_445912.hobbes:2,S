Why did that not work
See kmem_cache_create():
      /* 2) arch mandated alignment: disables debug if necessary */
        if (ralign < ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN) {
                ralign = ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN;
                if (ralign > BYTES_PER_WORD)
                        flags &= ~(SLAB_RED_ZONE | SLAB_STORE_USER);
        }
