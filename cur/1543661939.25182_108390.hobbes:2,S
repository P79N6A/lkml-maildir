as I said, you can consider asychronous all requests submitted with
current->mm, this will be 90% accurate.  This whole thing is an
heuristic, if the heuristic fails the behaviour become like w/o SFQ so
no regression. Also the latency of fsync is less critical than the
latency of a read() syscall, again, this is statistically, sometime it
can be the other way around.
