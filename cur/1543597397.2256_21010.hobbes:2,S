Can you test with the code I posted a hour or so ago please?
I ask this because I tested writes to:
  -- buffered devices
  -- ide with caching on
  -- ide with caching off
  -- scsi (caching on?)
To a buffered device, I get something silly like 63000
writes/second. No big surprises there (other than Linux is bloody lean
these days).
To a SCSI device (10K RPM SCSI-3 160 drive), I get something like 167
writes/second, which seems moderately sane if caching is disabled.
To a cheap IDE drive (5400 RPM?) with caching off, I get about 87
writes/second.
To the same drive, with caching on, I get almost 4000 writes/second.
This seems to imply, at least for my test IDE drive, you can turn
caching off --- and its about half as fast as my SCSI drives which
rotate at about twice the speed (sanity check).
IDE drive:  IBM-DTTA-351010, ATA DISK drive
SCSI drive: SEAGATE ST318404LC
