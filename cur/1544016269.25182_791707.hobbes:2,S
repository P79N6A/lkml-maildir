Andrew, are you sure that Makefile condition for compiling
up.o is correct?
ifeq ($(CONFIG_USE_GENERIC_SMP_HELPERS),y)
obj-y += smp.o
else
obj-y += up.o
endif
If an arch doesn't use generic SMP helpers, there is no way
we should compile up.c into the tree when SMP.
This build regression was caused by:

    smp_call_function_single(): be slightly less stupid
    
    If you do
    
    	smp_call_function_single(expression-with-side-effects, ...)
    
    then expression-with-side-effects never gets evaluated on UP builds.
    
    As always, implementing it in C is the correct thing to do.
    
    While we're there, uninline it for size and possible header dependency
    reasons.
    
    And create a new kernel/up.c, as a place in which to put
    uniprocessor-specific code and storage.  It should mirror kernel/smp.c.
