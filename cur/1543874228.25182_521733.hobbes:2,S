The trouble is that there are places where we want to intercept things
like sti/cli in entry.S in a context where all the registers are in use,
so we can't generally make the assumption that caller-saved regs are
clobberable.  For any call-site in compiler-generated code we can make
that assumption, of course.

For current processors, I think i-cache pollution is really the only
downside to a call.  But maybe you could put multiple pv-op functions
into a cacheline if they're used in close proximity
(cli/sti/save_fl/restore_fl would all fit into a single cacheline).

I spent some time looking at what it would take to get this going.  It
would probably look something like:
   1. make CONFIG_PARAVIRT select CONFIG_RELOCATABLE
   2. generate vmlinux
   3. extract relocs, and process the references to paravirt symbols
      into a table
   4. compile and link that table into the kernel again (like the ksyms
      dance)
   5. at boot time, use that table to redirect calls/references into the
      paravirt backend to the appropriate one
I think if we store the reloc references as section-relative, and the
reloc table itself is linked into its own section, then there's no need
for multipass linking to combine the reloc table into the kernel image,
since adding that table won't affect any existing reloc.
All this is doable; I'd probably end up hacking boot/compressed/relocs.c
to generate the appropriate reloc table.  My main concern is hacking the
kernel build process itself; I'm unsure of what it would actually take
to implement all this.

Possibly not, but I'd like to be able to say with confidence that
running a PARAVIRT kernel on bare hardware has no performance loss
compared to running a !PARAVIRT kernel.  There's the case of small
instruction sequences which have been replaced with calls (such as
sti/cli/push;popf/etc), and also the case of hooks which are noops on
native (like make_pte/pte_val, etc).  In those cases it would be nice to
patch in a replacement, either a real instruction or just nops.
