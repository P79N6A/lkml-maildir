hi,
i'm trying to track down a phenomena with 2.2.16 when my pentium-iii
slows down from 500 mhz to 66 mhz on my IBM thinkpad 390X (and never
comes back to 500 mhz).
in order to check at what speed i'm running, i'd like to check
/proc/cpuinfo for the actual "cpu MHz" but that info doesn't seem
to be updated by the kernel after booting.
any suggestions?
thilo
