Yes, that's expected. I think we fixed dd now.

Please enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB now and reproduce. It should tell us 
what's going wrong there.

Yes, because it is totally broken. So please just drop the patch. AFAICT 
the driver makes the process sleep in mcdex_transfer() until an interrupt 
comes to acknowledge that the I/O has completed but the patch makes the 
code sleep while holding the mutex and once the interrupt comes and tries 
to grab it, the machine will deadlock.
We probably need to fix it somehow but lets see what CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB 
tells us first. Btw, if anyone has a datasheet for this beast, I would 
like a copy.
