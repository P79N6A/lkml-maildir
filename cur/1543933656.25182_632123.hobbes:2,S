Huh?  Just call it from kmem_cache_destroy(); what business does that symlink
have being around after that point?

kobject_del() undoes the effect of kobject_add().  And then you are left
with the refcount you had before kobject_add(), i.e. from kobject_init().
Think of it that way: kobject refcount controls the lifetime of structure
the sucker's embedded into.  Depending on kobject methods, you might
be unable to do cleanup of non-kobject parts of that animal until after
kobject_del().  IOW, you _can't_ have kobject_del() dropping the (hopefully)
final reference to kobject - only the caller knows what might have to be
done in between.
