I did some bechmarks between a straight Debian slink machine
(glibc-2.0) running 2.2.5 and a glibc-2.1 machine running
2.2.7+NVSv3+Channel Bonding and the vanilla Debian machine provided 10x
better performance according to specweb.
This is with both the document root and the logfiles on NFS mounts from a
NetApp box and running Zeus web server.
There seemed to be some network bottleneck with the juiced up machine, CPU
load was <1 and the performance is best described as "bursty".
I have a test machine available that will be running when I can get power
to it that should allow me to find out exactly what the problem was.
