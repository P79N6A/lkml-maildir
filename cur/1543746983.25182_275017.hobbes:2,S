and for people who'd be tempted for new code it should at least warn if
not error even right now

it's still very much abuse, and quite nasty for dual endian platforms ;)

implementing your own is still evil, but glibc provides similar
constructs already. busy waiting in userspace is evil anyway (use futex
:) and.... just as with atomic.h, spinlock.h only gets compiled in for
CONFIG_SMP so the same caveats apply

Chrony then needs to make their own (by copying and cleaning up for all
I care).
