Sorry it's actually loopback, not broadcast as implemented in Linux.
In Linux it's implemented in ip_route_output_slow(). Essentially
converted to 127.0.0.1
I think it's traditional BSD behaviour but couldn't find it on
a quick look in FreeBSD source (but haven't looked very intensively) 
Admittedly port 0 is somewhat dodgy for UDP too, but at least in RAW
context it might be valid.
