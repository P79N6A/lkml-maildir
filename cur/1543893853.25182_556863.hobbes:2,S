Normally there shouldn't be a downstream. PCI IO tends to be not stacked,
but at the edges  (unless you're talking hypervisors with virtual devices but those 
definitely have separate memory pools). And the drivers I'm familiar with tend to 
first grab whatever resources they need and then map the DMA mappings.
