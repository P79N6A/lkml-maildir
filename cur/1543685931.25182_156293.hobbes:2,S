What I recall is no additional tests, but the different forms affected
the compilers choice of instructions on x86, making one form better
than another.  Unfortunately I don't recall what that was, or what
test it showed up in :(

This will break "if (likely(p)) { ... }"

This will give a warning with "if (unlikely(p)) { ... }"
