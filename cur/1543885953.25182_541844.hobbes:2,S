Not having any idea what I'm doing, I looked at cryptomgr_probe and 
cryptomgr_notify, and can't seem to see much, except for the following 
odd lines.
 From cryptomgr_schedule_probe, which is almost certainly inlined into 
crypto_notify:
-----
param = kzalloc(sizeof(*param), GFP_KERNEL);
...
param->thread = kthread_run(cryptomgr_probe, param, "cryptomgr");
if (IS_ERR(param->thread))
    goto err_free_param;
    return NOTIFY_STOP;
err_free_param:
        kfree(param);
err_put_module:
        module_put(THIS_MODULE);
err:
        return NOTIFY_OK;
-----
while cryptomgr_probe does (with a local variable param that points to 
the same data):
-----
...
if (err)
    goto err;
out:
    kfree(param);
    module_put_and_exit(0);
-----
Now perhaps I am wrong, but would it be possible for the kthread_run() 
call to cause cryptomgr_probe to run before the return result is stored 
into param->thread?  That would mean that param would be accessed after 
freeing.
<changes thread to a local variable in the cryptomgr_schedule_probe 
method...compile...test...still fails>
I guess that's not it.
Any thoughts on what might be the cause of this (I've added Herbert Xu 
to the CC list since he seems to be the crypto maintainer)?
I'll try to add some printk's in there to see if that enlightens me.
