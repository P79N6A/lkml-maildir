Ouch. I'm assuming this is with DMA disabled?

Now, _that_ is strange. I can't see anything that needs protection
across that call; in fact, I think we can lock a lot less than what we
currently do.

Is it worse than before? IIRC Remy mentioned something about
IRQF_NODELAY being the reason for moving all this code to softirq
context in the first place; does the interrupt handler run in hardirq
context?

Ok.

I think you're right. Can you change it and see if it helps?
I guess I didn't test it thoroughly enough with DMA
disabled...slub_debug ought to catch such things, but not until we
receive enough data to actually overflow the buffer.

Why should it be? If it should, we must move the call to tasklet_init
into atmel_startup too, and I don't really see the point.
