One thing I noticed on my BP6 system with dual 400's was that with a 250W
power supply I would get lots of APIC errors even at 66MHz and my I/O voltage
would fluctuate as much as 15%.  Once I replaced it with a 300W power supply,
the voltage smoothed out, and I noticed that I rarely, if ever get APIC errors
at 66MHz anymore.  Another thing to consider anyways.
