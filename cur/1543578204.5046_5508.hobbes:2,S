We have two Netfinity (7100 with 4 Xeon and 4500R with two PIII) and we
have noticed a weird behaviour with kernel 2.4.0 test and final.
*On the 7100, the final kernel can't detect two pci card (3C980 and
ForeRunnerLE.
*On the 4500R, the test kernel crash unexpectedly in two or three hours
And we have had two hard drive crashes with the serveraid cards that
resulted in a unusable filesystem.
Does anyone know if these are known issues of 2.4 kernels or if it may
be caused by another problem ?
The systems work with 2.2 kernels but we would like to use 2.4 for atm
support.
Thank you for your help.
