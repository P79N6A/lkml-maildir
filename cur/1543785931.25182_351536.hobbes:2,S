The via k8t800 based boards has "just worked" from day 1 for me going back 
to my socket 754 athlon 64 3000+ which is now fairly old.
As a brdige chipset it's starting to show it's age since it's agp rather 
than pci-x.

I sort of afraid of running machines with 4GB or more of ram without ecc 
memory, but that could be a personal fetish... at this level that argues 
in favor of a socket 940 rather than 939.

most of the amd64 systems I build are for servers and most of those have 
tyan mainboards at this point.
I'm sort of fascinated with the asrock/uli chipset mainboards that's 
floating around but I have actually splurged yet, and I haven't had a uli 
chipset mainboard since my cyrix 5x86mx 100 died a couple years ago.
