Yah.  It is pretty simple and it gives us a unique name without imposing
any naming policy.
I have, however, been thinking about using kobject paths. ;-)  I
actually like the idea now, but I do not think we can get a kobject for
most of the stuff we need, unfortunately.  Also, we need the kobject
name to be unique.  This is an interesting concept to keep in mind,
though.

No, we don't have any usage recommendations.  Going forward, this is
something we all need to work on and agree with.
All I want is a way to get events to user-space asynchronously without
any hacks.  This fits the bill nicely.  ;-)
That said, I do have some basic ideas about usage.  I see two main uses,
asynchronous events (such as, filesystem mounted) and the more specific
case of errors (such as device failure).
Criteria for adding the event would be that user-space needs to know
about it, and would normally have to poll to get the information.  If
the event is so non-important that right now no one even knows about it
or cares about it, it may not be worth adding.
But let's look at filesystem mounted, since many user-space applications
are interested in this.  Right now, they poll /proc/mtab every few
seconds, parse it, and look for changes.  Gross, right?
So we can create an event in fs/mount.c, say "/org/kernel/fs/mount" with
the signal "change".  The payload could be a simple "mounted" and
"unmounted" or the exact details on what was mounted or unmounted or
even nothing.  I'd prefer to give no information and just have the event
cause a re-read of /proc/mtab.  But whatever.
So we want up with, in do_mount,
	send_kevent (KEVENT_FS, "/org/kernel/fs/mount",
		     "change", "mounted");
Or similar.
