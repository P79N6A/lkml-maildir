Not all arch have page_is_ram(). OK it should be easy to have but we will
need create new data structures to keep this info. The point is that it's
really easy for memory model such sparsemem to keep this info.

show_mem(), which is arch specific, needs to report them. And some
implementations use only pfn_valid().
