There was some discussion of poor PPP performance in the 2.2.x kernels here
last week.  The suggested solution was to disable DMA on the hard disk.
I have a Toshiba Portege 3015CT running Debian Slink.  I compiled the 2.2.0
and 2.2.1 kernels and they run great...  EXCEPT that I still have the PPP
problem.  This machine does have a UDMA hard disk, so I tried disabling DMA
on the disk.  This did not fix the problem.  I tried the other settings
with hdparm, too, turning everything off and leaving the readahead at just
2.  This did not help at all.  I recompiled the kernel to not automatically
turn on DMA as well.  The next step would be to disable DMA entirely in the
kernel, I suppose, but it doesn't look like this DMA thing is the answer,
at least for me.
Has anyone got another idea?  I am getting the same bytes in the log from
pppd as described previously.  I too am seeing lots of errors with "netstat
ppp0".  This all worked find with 2.1.125 and 2.0.36.  Is it a problem with
pppd?  With pcmcia?  With the kernel?
Thanks for any suggestions,
Stephen
