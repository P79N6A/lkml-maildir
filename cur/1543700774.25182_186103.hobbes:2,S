And this is **precisely** why putting the device names in the kernel
via devfs was such a mistake.  Naming is policy, and should not be in
the kernel.  Yes, the new style names were Linus's idea, but the
problem was that while he has extremely good taste with respect to
code, unfortunately he had exquisitely bad taste with respect to devfs
device names.  And when one person's taste (even if that person is
Linus) about names can cause such grief, it should be an object lesson
about why putting that kind of user-visible naming policy in the
kernel is such a bad idea.

Shouldn't that be "jail" with a "g"?  (As in "gaol"?  :-)
