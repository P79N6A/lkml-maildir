Well, no one else seems concerned by that behavior (and I recall it  
being mentioned previously on this list somewhere).  I've tested it  
fairly extensively; if I turn up the drive speed with hdparm, it gets  
about 4 more CRC errors during data transfer (each badcrc command is  
retried, of course), and then does a bus reset and drops to a lower  
speed again.  I've never had any problems with data corruption on  
this system, and it has been a RAID5 fileserver for several years now.

Except you seem to have missed the fact that these errors never  
occurred under 2.6.12, and occur regularly on 2.6.15.  Besides, after  
the initial boot-time lowering of the speed, I never get another  
badCRC error from the drive, and I've never had any data corruption.
