Horrible. It WILL NOT WORK.
It does a access_ok() that uses the debugger address space to determine if
the debuggee is ok.
Also, debugreg6 is not a linear address at all. Only 0-3 are, so only they
should be tested.
Which is exactly what the test that already exists does.
No, it may not be obvious, but it's all there.
