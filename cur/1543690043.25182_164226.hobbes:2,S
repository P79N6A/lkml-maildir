Mhh, ATI seriously sucks. Really.

This whole situation stinks - ATI plays games with open source, using the
free parts to complement their own components and on the other hand prevent
implementation by kernel-developers... maybe there should be more talking
going on between hardware-manufacturers and linux-developers, because my
ATI-GraKa (9800 Pro) STILL does not work - not with 2.4.x, not with 2.6.x,
even with all the newest versions (problem not based on ATI drivers, but on
agpgart KT400 / AGP3 issues)
Since all compoments do work on W*nd*ws, I seriously wonder how much M$ pays
to ATI to prevent linux-driver development.
My apologies for being wrong about the bin-only-part...
Greetings,
Dennis
