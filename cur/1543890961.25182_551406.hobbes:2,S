I have actually started working on that.  It involves breaking down
fb_setcolreg() so it deals only with writing to the actual hardware
registers.  The part of fb_setcolreg() that adds entries to the
pseudo_palette can be separated as a new method, fb_get_pixel(), which
given red, blue, green, transp, the driver returns a u32 pixel value
that can be written to the pseudo_palette.
So fbcon can hold a copy of the pseudo_palette and fills it up by
calling info->fbops->fb_get_pixel() successively.
This will touch the logo code, the drawing libraries, each driver, etc
so it's a lot of work.  During the conversion period,  we support having
info->pseudo_palette and fbcon->pseudo_palette at the same time. Once
all drivers are converted, we can remove info->pseudo_palette.
One use for having an fb_get_pixel() method is we can use this as an
rgb888-image-to-raw-framebuffer-format converter.
Currently, I have only converted vesafb. Once the core code is done,
I'll start converting the rest of the drivers one by one.
