  Since you haven't written till today I assume that data=writeback does
not have a problem. Hmm. I really start to suspect my changes to JBD
commit code. But I was trying to reproduce the problem by copying files
there and back without success :( Also I check the code and I don't see
how we could loose dirty bits on buffers (which is probably what happens
as one guy has written to me that he also sees the problem when using
rtorrent which does checksum after downloading and that passes fine).
Next I'm going to try to reproduce the problem with heavy mmap load.
Maybe that would trigger it.
