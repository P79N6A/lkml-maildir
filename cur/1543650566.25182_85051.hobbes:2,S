I'm unlikely to be able to merge everything by tomorrow, so I will 
consider tomorrow a submission deadline to me, rather than a merge 
deadline. That said, I merged everything I'm sure I want to merge today, 
and the rest I simply haven't had time to look at very much.

This apparently breaks things like DRI, which I'm fairly unhappy about,
since I think 3D is important.

This one is just huge, and I have little personal judgement on it.

I don't know what this buys us.

I haven't even seen it.
> ext2/ext3 ACLs and Extended Attributes
I don't know why people still want ACL's. There were noises about them for 
samba, but I'v enot heard anything since. Are vendors using this?

I've seen this, it looks pretty ok.
> Crash Dumping (LKCD)
This is definitely a vendor-driven thing. I don't believe it has any 
relevance unless vendors actively support it.

I think I'll do at least the API, but there were some questions about the 
config options here, I think.
> Hotplug CPU Removal Support
No objections, but very little visibility into it either.
> Hires Timers
This one is likely another "vendor push" thing.
> EVMS
Not for the feature freeze, there are some noises that imply that SuSE may 
push it in their kernels. 
> initramfs
I want this.
> Kernel Probes
Probably.
