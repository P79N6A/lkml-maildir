Subject: [PATCH] Fix for Oops on boot

Hi,
If you compile a kernel with no block device support and try to boot it
with a root=/dev/xxx command line it will silently oops on boot when it
attempts to parse it. To fix this the do/while loop in
init/main.c:name_to_kdev_t should be changed to a while loop, thus
preventing it from dereferencing NULL on the first iteration. This only
occures if the root_dev_names table is completely empty.
This is particularly important if you are using the devfs patch or direct
major/minor numbers to locate the root device (as I am doing) - and it
prevents a very difficult to find oops..
