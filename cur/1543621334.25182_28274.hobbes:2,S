Paul,
	Thanks again for your comments. You are right, the d_count is 
getting mucked up through the __emul_lookup_dentry() path. I also 
discovered some problems with the way I was taking the dcache_lock.
So I will go back and try to fix those.
	I saw your patch for path_lookup. The next version of fast walk 
will include those changes (I had started making the changes before seeing
your patch anyway).
