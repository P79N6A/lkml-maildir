Looks OK to me; as soon as you decide how the low-level driver should
limit the baud rate, I'll update nb85e_uart.c to do it (storing max/min in
the uart_port structure, as someone suggested, seems pretty convenient).
If unsupported termios flags are passed in, what should the low-level
function do?  Tweak the contents of *termios to reflect reality?
BTW, why the name `settermios'?  Something like `set_termios' seems easier
to read and more in keeping with the style used elsewhere in the
serial-port code.  [settermios brings back horrible memories of BSD kernel
code...]
Thanks,
