Given the comments already on the list I won't repeat commetning
on your attitued, but if you really think the maintainers and everyone
else is totally clueless you should probably start the mail with that
so every is aware of it..
So if you can prove the fork+exec really is a problem I'd suggest you
go for an existing, standard interface instead.  That would be netlink
and not some chardev ioctl hack..
