My question is more whether they package up such a buildable
configured patched source tree (/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/* in RH-speak),
or just some extract like the .c/.h files.

Think about stuff that any function does.  It calls other functions,
and manipulates global data, which all show up as external references
in the object code.  All those references would have to be patched to
refer to the live running copy of the original compilation unit.
