Subject: [patch 010/198] fix crash in entry.S restore_all
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/12/323

From: Stas Sergeev <stsp@aknet.ru>
Fix the access-above-bottom-of-stack crash.
1. Allows to preserve the valueable optimization
2. Works for NMIs
3.  Doesn't care whether or not there are more of the like instances
   where the stack is left empty.
4. Seems to work for me without the crashes:) 
(akpm: this is still under discussion, although I _think_ it's OK.  You might
want to hold off)
