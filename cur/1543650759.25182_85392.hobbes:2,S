Hello Linus,
somewhere back in 2000, you wrote:

Out of curiosity, would you reaccept xiafs in 2.5, if it was cleaned up and 
forward ported to use the new interfaces?
And if you accept it, what's the latest date I could submit it? Technically, 
it is a regression, ;-) so the feature freeze date might not apply.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
P.S. I do not want to start a flamewar, it's just that I understood your 
mail from back then as a call for a xiafs maintainer.
