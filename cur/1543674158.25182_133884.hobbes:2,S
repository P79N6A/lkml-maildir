You're getting a lot of receive and send (checksum and accept) errors and 
as a result invalid vectors being sent to your processors, your APIC bus 
is seeing a lot of data corruption, looks like your motherboard might be 
on it's way out. Try running with 'noapic' to see if it's the IOAPIC or 
local APICs (my bet is on the IOAPIC which would be on your motherboard 
chipset)
