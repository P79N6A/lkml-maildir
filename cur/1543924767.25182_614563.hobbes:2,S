Not really hastily, I think it was written before the stuff hit
mainline. Inadequately tested, perhaps, its been in my and probably Wu's
kernels for a while. Granted that's not a lot of testing in the face of
those who have problems atm.

I'm perfectly happy with this patch earning its credits in -mm for a
while and maybe going in around -rc4 or something like that (hoping that
by then we've fixed these nagging issues).
Another patch I did come up with yesterday - not driven by any problems
in that area - could perhaps join this one on that path:

Subject: mm: bdi: tweak task dirty penalty
Penalizing heavy dirtiers with 1/8-th the total dirty limit might be rather
excessive on large memory machines. Use sqrt to scale it sub-linearly.
Update the comment while we're there.
