This was brought up before.  It's the case where the system is acting
as a router, you have to consider that case and not just the one where
the local system is where the connections are originating from.
Your trick only works because of how routes are cached per-socket.
Once you get into the realm of traffic going through the machine as
a router, the trick stops to work.
