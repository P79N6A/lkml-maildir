I was more concerned about the RAM use, actually.
This patch is an additional reason for CONFIG_NR_CPUS, but I've rather
gone cold on that idea because the "proper fix" is to make all those
huge per-cpu arrays dynamically allocated.   So you can run a 64p kernel
on 2p without losing hundreds of k of memory and kernel address space.
But it looks like all those dynamically-allocated structures would
have to be allocated out to NR_CPUS anyway, to support hotplug, yes?
In which case, CONFIG_NR_CPUS is the only way to get the memory
back...
