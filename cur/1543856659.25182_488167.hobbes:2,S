I'm still not happy.
The return value of "hash_u64()" had better be  u64, not "unsigned long".
Same goes (to a smaller degree) for hash_u32().
I can trivially just edit the patch and fix these things, but with two 
bugs found by just inspection of the patch, I'm going to ask you to look 
it over one more time and re-send me a "guaranteed correct" version, ok? 
Because I'm a very religious man, and my religion basically boils down to 
  "If somebody else can do it for me, they should. I'm lazy, and I like it 
   that way. Besides, next time maybe they'll double-check on their own".
Thanks. And please spread the Good Word.
