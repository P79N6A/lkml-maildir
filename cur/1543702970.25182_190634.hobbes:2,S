Yep...we told it to disable the SQE test so the heartbeat error no
longer appears. The carrier errors are still present, though. This
definitely smells like a configuration problem, but without docs and a
card to test with there's not much else I can do. I'll poke thru the
code and see if anything else leaps out at me.  If anybody out there
has Comet docs or a NIC that exhibits this problem they'd be willing to
loan I'll take a deeper look.
