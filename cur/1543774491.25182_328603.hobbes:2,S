A small comment.  How about having one file named 'bind', which acts like
either bind or unbind if nothing (empty string) has written to it?
(for fun.. that'd be 'driver' file, which, when read, returns the name
of the driver currently bound to the device.. but too bad, 'driver' is
a symlink already...)
