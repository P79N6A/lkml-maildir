Ah, you were cheated by Andre.
In the good old days `hdparm -i' gave interesting output.
These days `hdparm -i' prints not what the disk says, but
what the author of the IDE driver thought you would prefer to see.
So, `hdparm -i' is completely worthless (for geometries) these days.
That is why I asked for `hdparm -I'.
Let me predict that it will say
# /sbin/hdparm -I /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 Model=aMtxro9 71828D, FwRev=AG5S1421, SerialNo=8A501SCX
 Config={ Fixed }
 RawCHS=16383/16/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=29
 ...
and hence is not an exception. It really tells the world
that it is 16383/16/63, entirely according to the standard.
