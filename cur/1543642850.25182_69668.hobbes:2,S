Subject: Trivial patch: linux-2.5.33/arch/i386/pci/irq.c - pcibios_fixup_irqs should be static
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	pcibios_fixup_irqs declared in linux-2.5.33/arch/i386/pci/irq.c
is only called from within that file.  So, it should be declared static
(as it already is in the linux-2.5.33/arch/i386/pci/visws.c version).
The following patch makes that change.  Do you want to integrate this
and forward it to Linus the next time you submit some changes, or is
there some other course of action that you'd prefer?
