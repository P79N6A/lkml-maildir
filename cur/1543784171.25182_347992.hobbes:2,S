Right. The costs come about through wrong anticipations installing useless 
mappings. The patches that I posted have this feature off by default. Gang 
scheduling can be enabled by modifying a value in /proc. But I guess the 
approach is essentially dead unless others want this feature too. The 
current page fault scalability approach should be fine for a couple of 
years and who knows what direction mmu technology has taken then.
