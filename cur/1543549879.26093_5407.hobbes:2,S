Okay, I'm user on small machine and I'm doing stupid thing: I've got
6MB ram, and I keep inserting modules. I insert module_1mb.o. Then I
insert module_1mb.o. Repeat. How does it end? I think that
kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) *has* to return NULL at some point. 
Killing apps is not a solution: If my insmoder is smaller than module
I'm trying to insert, and it happens to be the only process, you just
will not be able to kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL, sizeof(module)). Will you
panic at the end?
