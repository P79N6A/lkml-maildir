What happens if your vmlinuz accidentally gets corrupted? If your initrd
is toast the module for your root fs doesn't load either. Duh.

If you loose 10 disks out of your raid array, how do you boot ?

And that is an easy task for distribution makers (or actually the people
who make the initrd creation software).
I'm sorry, I'm not buying your arguments and consider 100% the wrong
direction. I'm hoping that someone with a bit more time than me will
write the DDF device mapper target so that I can use it for my
kernels... ;)
