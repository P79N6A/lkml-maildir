Is there any userspace code avaialble which people can use to play with
this?
How do you envisage it being used in the long term?  Do you expect any of
the standard performance tuning tools will be tweaked to understand this
feature and if so which ones?
I'm generally wondering "how will developers be using this in a year or
two's time?"
Please cc Michael Kerrisk <mtk-manpages@gmx.net> on future versions of
these patches.
The patches were horridly wordwrapped.
Is there any likelihood that any other CPUs do now or will in the future
support any similar feature to this?  If so, is an implementation which is
100% contained to arch/x86 appropriate?
