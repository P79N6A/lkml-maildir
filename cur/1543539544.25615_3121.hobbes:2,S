  What if someone made a modem that accepts ATSLINE_RAW_OUTPUT=AC380V50HZ
and does just that? Serial drivers should be immediatelly changed to hunt
for that line (and all variations of it) to protect modem-owning
population from frying their phone lines and killing themselves? Or modem
manufacturer should be umm... educated about what is reasonable to put in
a hardware and what isn't?
