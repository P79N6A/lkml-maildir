I don't know how you wanted NODE_DATA() to be consulted here. i.e before 
calling reserve_bootmem_node() should we have a condition 
	if (PFN_UP(physbase+reserve_size) > node_end_pfn) 
	then
		resize reserve_size again so that PFN_UP() will equate to node_end_pfn ??
	end 
Also I was wondering if in reserve_bootmem_node()
	end = PFN_DOWN() ; will do.. 
With the recent changes from you that went into 2.6.28 stable 
(commit:a4c74ddd5ea3db53fc73d29c222b22656a7d05be), it worked on the system 
with PFN_DOWN(). 
Thanks,
