I see... unfortunately this is some strange kind of engineering sample
:-(, and they are no longer replacing the memory.
Does someone still have the application that tests if the flaw is
present? Is there easy way to tell that from markings on the chip?
"korea 253 PC2100S-25330-Z M470L6423DN0-CB0 512MB DDR PC2100CL2.5"
Some sources report that it only happens with C3 -- and I had usb
plugged in, that should result in no C3...
