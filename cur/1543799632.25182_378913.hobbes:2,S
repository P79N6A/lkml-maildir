Strange, I thought we'd fixed this.
Aww crap....
Linus, X.org is doing a MAP_PRIVATE mmap() of these discontiguous
I/O mappings of the sparc frame buffer device it seems.  So the
MAP_SHARED check in is_cow_mapping() doesn't pass.
Michael, does X.org work properly with your FFB card with 2.6.14 by
chance?
I really haven't used X.org on anything other than an ATI Radeon on
Sparc boxes, so it's highly possible that SunFFB support in X.org has
deteriorated into a non-working state due to not being looked after by
anyone.
Back to the MAP_SHARED issue, the culprit code in X.org can be fixed
but I know that this thing has been coded this way for years.  It
goes like this (hw/xfree86/os-support/bus/Sbus.c:xf86MapSbusMem()):
    ret = (pointer) mmap (NULL, len, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE,
                          psdp->fd, off);
    if (ret == (pointer) -1) {
        ret = (pointer) mmap (NULL, len, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED,
                              psdp->fd, off);
    }
    if (ret == (pointer) -1)
        return NULL;
and that should be fixed to just be:
    ret = (pointer) mmap (NULL, len, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED,
                          psdp->fd, off);
    if (ret == (pointer) -1)
        return NULL;
Ie. use MAP_SHARED unconditionally.
