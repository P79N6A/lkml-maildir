this was just c&p during debug, from another file.

I meant 4.0.2 as shipped with SuSE 10.0, but thats ok. I think the buggy
version was 3.2, as we have not seen in with gcc 3.3-hammer in SLES9.
Will you include the reiserfs change with a check for earlier then 4.0
or 4.1 or should I send a separate patch?
