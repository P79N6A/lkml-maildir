I don't recall ever sending you diffs for the driver.  My guess is that
6.1.5 got integrated into -ac from Linus' tree.
Up to now, I haven't been tracking -ac kernels.  I started sending
diffs to Linus based on the pre series kernels.  No-one has requested
patch sets against -ac kernels, but if I need to support this branch,
I'll start generating them and passing them your way.
Chasing after all of the kernel versions can be time consuming for
driver developers too. ;-)
