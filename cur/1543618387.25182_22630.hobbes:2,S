While trying to upgrade to this kernel it fails to boot on my PII 440bx
system:
---------------
kernel panic: can't allocate root vfsmount
<1> unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000002c
<0> kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handling!
In interrupt handling - not syncing
----------------
It spat out a stack trace, if anyone wants it.
I'm back to running my old kernel 2.4.18-pre1.
