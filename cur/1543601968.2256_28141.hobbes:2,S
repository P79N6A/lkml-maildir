It means that you prefer system dying under much lighter load.  At some
point any box will get into feedback loop, when slowdown from VM load
will make request handling slower, which will make temp. allocations
needed to handle these requests to be kept around for longer periods,
which will contribute to VM load.  The question being, at which point
will it happen and how graceful will the degradation be when we get
near that point.
