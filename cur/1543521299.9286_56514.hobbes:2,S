I think a kernel as second-stage bootloader is overkill. I think people
should rather work merging the advantages of LILO and those of GRUB, to
get a DECENT bootloader. What I hate most about LILO is the unawareness
of file systems and the ugly menu, what GRUB lacks, is the ability of
passing in "next-time" boot-parameters of lilo -R way - which prevents
many people of switching from LILO to GRUB. 
Besides that, it would be really cool if you could just replace a
running kernel by a new one, though I think it would require shutting
down all services prior to that. Still, not going through the BIOS boot
procedure would be an advantage... 
Find GRUB at 
ftp://alpha.gnu.org/pub/grub/
 (that is from memory, in case
it's wrong, search for it at freshmeat.net).
