Now that you suggested this, done.
But a good idea?
Since 1995 I have off and on run a system with 32-bit or 64-bit dev_t.
But <sys/sysmacros.h> has
    # define major(dev) ((int)(((dev) >> 8) & 0xff))
    # define minor(dev) ((int)((dev) & 0xff))
and I really mean
    statbuf.st_rdev>>8
not
    (statbuf.st_rdev>>8) & 0xff
so a private macro major() is needed, different from the glibc one.

[You must have seen my setup a few times: if all nonzero bits
are among the last 16, then read it as 8+8, otherwise, if
all nonzero bits are among the last 32, read it as 16+16,
otherwise read it as 32+32. That way old device numbers
do not change when dev_t grows. That way some ambiguity in
isofs mastering is resolved cleanly.]
