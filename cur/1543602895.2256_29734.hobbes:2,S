Hai,
		In one of my project I am using Linux-2.4.2. I have JBOD
(Just Bunch of Disks) connected to two machines using FC card (Fiber
channel)  . When I loaded driver the disks are identified randomly in two
machines. That is consider 1st computer is identified in a sequence of
disk1, disk2 ....etc ..... associated with the device file /dev/sda,
/dev/sdb .... etc as I see  it from 2 computer the associated sequence may
be difference. Is there any solution to match the sequence . If any body now
about problem help me.
Thanks
Eshwar
