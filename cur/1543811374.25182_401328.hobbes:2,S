Welcome to the club ;)  I gave up make randconfig months ago as 
there's simply too much noise in there...  There are same errors 
popping up for months now without resolution, and I lack experience 
to fix most things I see -- asked akpm once but not grok Andrew's 
response (months ago).
But is it summer here and I don't do much testing in hot weather.
Grant.
