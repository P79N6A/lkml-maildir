I have a concern with this approach though. It seems to assume that
there is one global thing somewhere that sets the system state; in my
experience that is the wrong approach; in fact there is a very definite
evidence that there are many decisions on power that are to be made
local at a high frequency. An example of this is the processor speed;
the ondemand governer does exactly this for the cpus that can switch
speeds fast; it's just impossible to beat such a local, fast decision
with anything on a global scale.
On the other hand, some things (the high level goals and constraints)
are obviously global.
However, your design seems to want to put the low level settings in a
global thing, and that is just a mistake.
