I think it would be worth the effort.  One approach would be to
create a `can_sleep()' macro.  Add that to functions which may
schedule.  It's useful for documentation purposes as well as runtime
checks.
The Stanford checker caught a lot of these, but it seems that
the (high) amount of source-level obfuscation in the ipc code
defeated it.

There are at present no tools in the tree to trap this
problem.
