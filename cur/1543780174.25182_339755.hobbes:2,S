Subject: [2.6 patch] fs/Kconfig: quota help text updates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/6/59

This patch contains the following updates to the help texts:
- QUOTA: most people will get the quota utilities from their 
         distribution, and if not the mini-HOWTO will tell them
- QFMT_V2: quota utilities 3.01 are no longer recent, they are now 
           ancient
           and 3.01 is lower than the minimal version documented in
           Documentation/Changes

 	  If you say Y here, you will be able to set per user limits for disk
 	  usage (also called disk quotas). Currently, it works for the
 	  ext2, ext3, and reiserfs file system. ext3 also supports journalled
 	  quotas for which you don't need to run quotacheck(8) after an unclean
-	  shutdown. You need additional software in order to use quota support

 or the documentation provided
 	  with the quota tools. Probably the quota support is only useful for
 	  multi user systems. If unsure, say N.
