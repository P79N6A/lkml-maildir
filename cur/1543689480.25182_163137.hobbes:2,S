Andrews patch removed the first IMM_EPP_16 line in the array.
This isn't correct especially in the !CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16 case,
reading all uses of this array (IMM_MODE_STRING is used to print the
corresponding string in printks).
If I'm not misunderstanding it, CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16 means "use 16bit 
even when 32bit is requested".
It seems the right solution is
static char *IMM_MODE_STRING[] =
{
        [IMM_AUTODETECT] = "Autodetect",
        [IMM_NIBBLE]     = "SPP",
        [IMM_PS2]        = "PS/2",
        [IMM_EPP_8]      = "EPP 8 bit",
        [IMM_EPP_16]     = "EPP 16 bit",
#ifdef CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16
        [IMM_EPP_32]     = "EPP 16 bit",
#else
        [IMM_EPP_32]     = "EPP 32 bit",
#endif
        [IMM_UNKNOWN]    = "Unknown",
};
A patch against the current BK tree is below.
