Is that really the consensus on these definitions? I thought it was
more or less the opposite:
* DEPRECATED == no (complete) replacement available yet, but it has
  been decided that this code is less than optimal and alternatives
  should be preferred
* OBSOLETE == replacement available, no reason to use this code anymore
