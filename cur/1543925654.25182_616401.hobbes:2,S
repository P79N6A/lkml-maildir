Well, I'm using two years old 2.6.7 kernel, because the newer
ones have become utter and total crap. (See the link in the
previous post.) It will likely be my last Linux kernel ever,
that I will use until this system becomes simply too obsolete,
at which point, if not before, I'll switch to either FreeBSD 
(quite unlikely), or Windows (XP), unless an unlikely miracle
has happened and FOSS has improved instead of continuing its
rapid downfall, dragging all of good bits of *nix legacy down
with it, retaining the bad bits.
