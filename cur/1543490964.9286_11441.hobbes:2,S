Well, you've got at least four dropped data segments in that little bit
of the trace.  Figure out where the packets get dropped and why, then
once that is worked out you can work on the TCP protocols.  It certainly
can't be the router's fault :).
TCP is just doing the best it can under the circumstances.  But you
should see similar droppage with other kernels.
