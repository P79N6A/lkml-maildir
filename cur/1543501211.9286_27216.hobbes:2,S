If you have 
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/podfuk/podfuk.html
installed, then:
If you have directory, adding #tar at the end makes tar file from
it. If you have tar file, adding #utar at the end makes it look like
directory. ... which is adequate conversion way in my eyes. Doing it
completely automatic would confuse just about everything.

PS: The kernel hook is already there. It is called "coda".
