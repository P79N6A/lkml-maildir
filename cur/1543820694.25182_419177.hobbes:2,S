The bit needs to be somewhere, but I think sticking it in the syscall
bitmask is a bad idea.  Mixing apples and oranges, as it were.
Sticking it in the op is better, even though that's a bit of apples
and oranges as well.
Another alternative would be to make it an option and set it with
PTRACE_SETOPTIONS.
