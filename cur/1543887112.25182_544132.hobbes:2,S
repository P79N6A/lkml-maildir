Atleast with get_hot_cpu()/put_hot_cpu(), complexity is limited
to the implementation of those interfaces and not all over the
kernel. Having worked on CPU hotplug in the past, I have no doubt
that this is the most simple *locking model* for cpu
hotplug events.

One possibility is to have a generation counter for all cpu events
and save it in cpumask_t (or some debug version of it) every
time we snapshot the online cpu mask. We can then
put checks in places where we access them whether the generation
counter matches the current generation or not. If it doesn't
it would indicate that saved cpumask not being "updated" during
cpu hotplug events. In the cpu hotplug event handlers, we can
force all saved online cpumasks to be "updated". Such debug
code may help detect the locking violators.
