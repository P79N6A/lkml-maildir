Subject: 2.3.22 and 23pre1 network hangs, .23pre4 beeps forever

	In 2.3.22, 2.3.22pre1 and 2.3.22pre2, my system hangs as
soon as I try to telnet to another machine.  It seems to be somehow
related to establishing a TCP connection, since just pinging another
machine does not cause the problem.  Also, the way that the machine
hangs is a bit strange, but seems to match the description that
other people on this list have posted.  My characters are still
echoed on the console on which I was originally typing and I can
switch virtual consoles, but typing seems to have not effect in
the other virtual consoles, and there is no response to other
what I type in the original virtual console (for example, control-C
does not work).
	I am sorry for not having more detailed information about
this, but I thought I'd upgrade to 2.3.22pre4, which resulted in
a kernel that just prints one line, turns on the bell and never
turns it off.  Since it's 4:30am right now, I think I am going
to wimp out and just send this report to linux-kernel in case
anyone else finds it useful.  I will probably do more experimentation
with 2.3.22pre2 or pre3 tomorrow.
