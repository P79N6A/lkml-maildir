I don't see how the case of mprotect(HIGH_ADDRESS, LEN, PROT_EXEC) be
handled.  Unlike mremap, mprotect doesn't offer a way to inform the user
about a change of address.
If I understand correctly, such case will cause a call to
arch_add_exec_range(current->mm, vma) without any remapping, thus breaking
the protection.
One case where this would happen is some of the ancient loaders.  IIRC,
libc4's loader did just that.  (right, nobody uses it anymore :)
btw, I guess that now, at least when X_workaround==1, exploits will focus
on getting iopl(2) called before they get the actual shellcode called.
In some cases it may be easy to cause a call to iopl (param doesn't matter
as long as its not zero).  Once this is achieved, protection is disabled.
For that reason, maybe X_workaround should be controlled per-executable
by another ELF flag and not as a system-wide property.
