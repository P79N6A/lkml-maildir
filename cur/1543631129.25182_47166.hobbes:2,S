Three trillion filesystems for which we don't have a mkfs which
access bh->b_data all over the place :(

They'd create a separate address_space in that case.  The blockdev
mappings are pretty unambiguously tied to ZONE_NORMAL in bdget().

s/buffer_heads/blockdev pages/
Yes, vaguely.  Haven't thought about it a lot.  I suspect the
present kmap() infrastructure would collapse under the load,
so surgery there would be needed first.

In which case one could trivially report the number of active pages
against all superblocks.  Let's park this one until a need
is demonstrated though...
