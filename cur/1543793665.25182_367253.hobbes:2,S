Hmm. It seems the c3 compensation is triggering when it shouldn't, or
maybe its over compensating. 
I can't reproduce it on my laptop. Do you recall if in previous tests
you saw anything like this? I'm trying to narrow down if its just a
difference in hardware or if something in the c3 idle code changed.
