You don't strictly even need to LRU it - you could just keep a pte count 
aroudn, and when it goes to zero you zap the pmd. You can use the normal 
page_count() thing for it.
HOWEVER, I'm rather certain that this won't actually help in real life, 
and it does add complexity.
The solution really is a "don't do it then" kind of thing. If you have 
5000 processes that all want to map a big shared memory area, and you 
don't want to upgrade your CPU's, it's a _whole_ lot easier to just have a 
magic "map_large_page()" system call, and start using the 2MB page support 
of the x86.
And no, this should NOT be a mmap.
It's a magic x86-only system call, for the express purpose of adding 
something well-contained (but really ugly) for Oracle or other similar 
users. I don't mind "really ugly" as long as it doesn't have any impact 
on the rest of the system.
It should be less than a few hundred lines of code. Suggested starting 
point appended.
Making the _generic_ code jump through hoops because some stupid special 
case that nobody else is interested in is bad.
