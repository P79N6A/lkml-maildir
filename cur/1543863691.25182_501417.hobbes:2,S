some suggestions immediately come to mind:
* have you tried the latest driver from 
http://e1000.sf.net/
 ?
* what happens when you unplug the card and modprobe the ixgb module?
* have you tried capturing a trace with netconsole or serial console? probing 
the ixgb driver produces at least 1 syslog line that should show up. If nothing 
shows up on serial or netconsole, the issue may be way outside the ixgb driver.

just for completeness, which driver versions were this?
and when you say "booting fc6" I assume you mean that fc6 boots OK until you 
modprobe the ixgb driver?

try compiling your kernel without MSI support alltogether. There have been 
serious issues found with MSI on certain configurations, and in your case this 
might be the cause. Allthough passing pci=nomsi should be the same as compiling 
it out, it can't hurt to try.

I've taken action to get that straightened out. You're always welcome to mail 
netdev, the e1000 devel list or even lkml which we will all pick up on.
I can't think of a specific reason for the issue right now, other than 
attempting to get a serial/netconsole attached and trying without any msi 
support in the kernel. Please give that a try and let us know.
