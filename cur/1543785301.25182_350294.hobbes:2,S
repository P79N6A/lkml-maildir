Us too.  Especially RAID.

"u64 lun" is a lot worse than "u8 LUN[8]".  you can work with
the latter but the former raises questions like
 "How was this translated from the "u8 LUN[8]" which I use
  in the application client and in the transport?"
Etc.
Then, if your lun is 16 bits, there is no question where it is
in "u8 LUN[8]" -- SAM is _clear_ on that.
Second, as I said before a Logical Unit Number _is_ "u8 LUN[8]",
there is _no_ MSB or LSB, and there will never be.  Thus, you cannot
stuff it into "u64".
Yes, we _can_ have _one_ LUN that fits all, _because_
we would copy it _as_ is from the LLDD, be it 16 bits or
32 bits or whatever, in SCSI order format: Big endian.
Again, SAM is clear on that.
