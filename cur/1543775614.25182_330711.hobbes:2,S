Well, I've looked more closely at this.  There's no support in either
the core or the sequencer for IU or QAS, so I think the safe course is
just to strip them out of the transport parameters (I don't have the
sequencer docs anyway, so there's no way I can correct the problem).
This should, therefore, get the whole lot booting again.
