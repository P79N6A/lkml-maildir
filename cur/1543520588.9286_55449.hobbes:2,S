True. In theory this makes this point moot. But in real-life I want to
reduce the number of attacks that succede. That means x86.

I was previously unaware of the cases where it does. These can be added to
the support. How often do you add new tramp codes?

How often do these change?

Well, there is a price to improved security.

You don't need AI. There are lots of things OSes do that will break if you
try something weird. I don't believe that new tramp codes are added often
to egcs.

Not true. The patch actually makes this kind of attack tougher.

I agree with that. But I dont agree that the user is dumb here.
Do you use netscape on a computer of yours? Do you SU to root?
Does this mean that you are dumb? I dont think so..
Does this mean that you are at risk? Probably.

I dont agree with that.  Long ago, I offered a small reward on this list
(I think $50 us) to anyone that provided me with:
A) an app that breaks (not that hard)
B) An exploit for an app ever shipped with a distribution (I.e. mountd in
   slackware 1.2.x) which will work with the patch.
I never got an example. 
This patch actually makes this kind of attack more difficult.

This, I agree might be a valid point. But is there a legitmite need to
change the tramp code in GNAT/FPK that often?
