Exactly. Recursion more then few levels deep is not an option here.

I'm not sure what is better in your case but if resursion can be more then
few levels deep in normal (not pathological) situations then better to avoid
resursion altogether.

It's somewhere in the sources :-) Basic idea is simple: kernel stack use 2 pages
(4KiB each) at fixed position in memory (in virtual memory that is :-) but on
the bottom of stack there are current task struct (960 bytes in 2.2 if I recall
correct). So in stack overflow case you'll ruin that structure and get random
kernel oops. On other hand structure of kernel stack is simple so checking for
stack overflow can be done easy.
P.S. All this stuff is architecture-dependant but kernel stack is TINY on all
architectures. Why ? Since you need kernel stack for EVERY task in system and
it's NON-SWAPABLE area !
