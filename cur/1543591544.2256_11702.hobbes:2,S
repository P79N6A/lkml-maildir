That's another problem, indeed ;)
Ingo, Mike, please keep this in mind when designing
tunables or deciding which test you want to run today
in order to look how the VM is performing.
Basic rule for VM: once you start swapping, you cannot
win;  All you can do is make sure no situation loses
really badly and most situations perform reasonably.
