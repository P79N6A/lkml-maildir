OK, I see what you're doing now.
One obvious problem with it is that __emul_lookup_dentry()[1] calls
path_walk() internally, and the nd passed has uncounted references and
no LOOKUP_LOCKED flag - I suspect that this will cause reference counts
to get mucked up.
Also:
1) you really need to fix the patch whitespace/formatting
2) Please again consider calling it path_lookup() rather than 
path_init_walk() - the fact that since 2.3.x programmers have had to be 
aware of the separate path_init()/path_walk() stages is an 
implementation wrinkle that it would be nice to get rid of.

[1] Actually, __emul_lookup_dentry() probably ought to be simplified
somewhat - it seems to be duplicating a fair chunk of code from
path_init().
