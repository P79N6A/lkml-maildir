Yes, but a lower quality one. __update_rq_clock tries to compensate
large jumping clocks with a jiffy resolution, while my offset arranges
for a very smooth frequency transition.
I agree with keeping a single offset, but I liked the fact that with my
patch on frequency change, the clock had no jump at all.

I guess this needs to go away if I don't make my point :-(

Pointing it out just to be sure it does not end in the final version ;-)
Thanks for cleaning up my mess ;-)
