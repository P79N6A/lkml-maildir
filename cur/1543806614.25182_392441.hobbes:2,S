Boards with this chipset tend to have some timing in the DSDT wrong
which prevents ACPI te actually use the C2/C3 states. It seems that
C2/C3 can only be used on amd76x boards with some extra setup code.
Maybe it would be an idea to merge both pieces of code as much as
possible?
BTW there it looks like there is a bug in the linux SMP ACPI Cx code;
when I patch the code to "see" only valid timings, only one processor
shows states or than C1, the other only shows (and uses) C1.
