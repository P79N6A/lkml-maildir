How about /dev/hda? If you are talking about absolute block addresses you
are way below the partitioning level.

So set blksize_size and blk_size to whatever your driver can serve (sorry
about the typo in the previous posting - blksize_size is sector size and
blk_size is the number of sectors). VFS _will_ believe whatever your
driver says.

Yes, it can, if your driver sets blksize_size correctly. _All_ information
about device size is taken from that array and it's driver's business to
put there whatever it believes to be the device size.
	Again, for the VFS/filesystems/etc. "device size" means only one
thing: "driver told us not to give it requests with ->sector greater than
that number". That's it. Put 30*1024*1024*1024/512 there and kernel will
believe that disk is 30Gb (but then you'ld better be ready to serve such
requests, indeed).
It's entirely driver business - you tell the kernel how large sector
numbers you are ready to deal with and you are done.
