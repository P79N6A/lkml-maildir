Hi,
I've got some questions on supporting PCI Express AER in Linux HBA drivers.
BTW, I'm developing SCSI HBA driver.
What are the expected changes on SCSI LLD driver in regards to PCIE
AER supporting? I understood that the driver need to call following
API during probing,
---
if (pci_find_aer_capability(dev)) {
    pci_enable_pcie_error_reporting(dev);
}
---
What else does SCSI LLD driver need to changed?
Thanks in advance.
Allexio
