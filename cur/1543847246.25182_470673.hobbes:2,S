Well, while nice for "it basically works", that will not stress
hotplug subsystem too badly.
If you want some real nasty tests:
hotplug_locking: create 10 threads, make them try to online/offline
random cpus, all in paralel. (This is what I was doing in smaller
scale). You'll get some expected errors (like cpu already up), but
system should survive.
cpufreq: change cpufreq parameters on cpu (toggling min/max
frequency?) while trying to online/offline that cpu from another
thread.
suspend: swapoff -a, then proceed like in hotplug_locking, while
trying to suspend machine to disk (it will immediately wake up because
of no swap available). Should be useful at pointing out bugs in
suspend code. (but quite tricky to setup the test, so you may or may
not want to do this one).

Hmm, perhaps you should add ppc64 to the hotplug_report.html, so that
some green can be seen :-).
