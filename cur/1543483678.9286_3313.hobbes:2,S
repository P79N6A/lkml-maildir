Out of curiosity, I have a P90 running on a Gigabyte Intel 430FX-based
motherboard -- when rebooting the box, I sometimes get the BIOS boot error
message "Memory test failed" instead of a normal memory count.  This is
independent of kernel version and happens about one in three reboots.
Note that there are no other problems with the box; there's no problem with
the memory itself.  It is only after rebooting Linux that this happens.  Never
happens on a cold boot or after hitting the reset switch.
Does this happen to anyone else?
Charles
