Too bad screen supports only black'n'white pure vt100 properly (yes
there've been poor quality hacks for basic ansi color support...)
I'm considering writing a getty replacement for this kind of thing...
but a pure user-level solution looks to be near impossible (that is,
insane waste of cpu & memory & too complex to implement...) as Linux has
several "unsafe" escape sequences and ioctls (chvt, ...)
That means I need to process every escape sequence instead of just the
ones used to control this getty replacement thingie unless I tell the
kernel to disable those unsafe things when the getty replacement is in use
Also the current model of running a getty for every tty is really stupid...
The VT logins should be handled by one process which'd allow spawning a
new login shell with a single loadkeys-definable "key" for the current
user, handle user session locking and so on... also the alt-fX (or
whatever you want to use to change the consoles) could easily be redefined
by the program to go to current user's VT #x instead; that could be named
virtually numbered virtual consoles or something like that ;)
(from the secure-the-console viewpoint the current user shouldn't need to
know anything about the other users besides the fact they exist)
Also we'd need some easy way to reset the keyboard mode from RAW to
something the normal programs understand... and NOBODY besides ROOT should
be allowed to lock the console so that others can't access it at all...
Everybody should have a simple way to lock their own session though.
Anyone ever thought about implementing this kind of things?
Any other comments, flames, plain FUD or something? ;)
[as a partially related note I'm also considering an user-level console
implementation... and maybe some fb trickery too... if I ever have time to
get started that is ;)]
