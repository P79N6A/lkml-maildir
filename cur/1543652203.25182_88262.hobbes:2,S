I have not heard of more than about 90MB.  One of the things I would
not be surprised to see in the next couple of years as memory gets
cheaper is diskless systems that don't even bother doing NFS root and
just put everything in an initrd.  But that is not the main concern.
Since there are more polite ways of allocating memory already
implemented.  Sucking up a 16MB hunk of some ones  vmalloc space is
quite rude.  Currently the limit is pretty much 50% of system memory
or 1GB whichever is less because the code must be loaded into user
space first, and I don't touch high memory.  Although I guess if it
was mmaped read only the limit may be higher. 
I don't expect to come to close to using all of system memory
except on limited memory systems.  But it is always nice to be
polite.
