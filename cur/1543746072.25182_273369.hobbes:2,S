wouldn't it be better if such things would be implemented in a library?
use gnome-vfs, or try to get a vfs layer into libc.
That way you can even support different and old kernels and all
filesystems.
The kernel already provides all methods that are neccessary to do that.
So there is no need to implement it in the kernel.
