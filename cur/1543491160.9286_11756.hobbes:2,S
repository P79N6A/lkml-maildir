Is it a real 400, or did you OC?  I've just not OC'd mine yet, and
don't really know if I ever will.

:: Regardless, Matthew, you should have /proc/mtrr on 2.2.4-ac1. I can send

No, that's Ok.  I'm not sure who's patch to get, though, Alan's or
Richard's.  Decisions, decisions!  Are there implications in going one
way or the other? How about when 2.2.5 is released; how well will that
patch work?  I've never really done in-between patches before.
