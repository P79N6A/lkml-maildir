*If* you want safe dumping to a partition, it seems wrong to me to try to  
figure that out after the crash.
Instead,
* configure the crash space with a user-mode app or possibly a kernel  
command line arg
* Whenever repartitioning, check if the crash dump partition is affected,  
and if so, clear it until it is explicitely reconfigured
* Save a good checksum (say, md5 or sha1) of the crash partition config,  
and only dump if that checksum checks out
You might want to checksum even more than that, of course :-)
But there's certainly a reason Netware liked to crash dump to a series of  
floppies - too bad those are much too small for today's machines. When  
floppy sizes stopped to be slightly larger than standard RAM sizes[*], the  
computing public lost big time, and we haven't recovered from that.
[*] Apple ][+: 48 KB RAM, 140 KB floppy. IBM PC: 640 KB RAM, 1.2 MB  
floppy. (Yes, I know there were other combinations as well.) Where's my  
approximately-1-GB floppy that everyone and their aunt have installed  
today? No, CD writers are *not* universal. And burn-once CDs aren't much  
like floppies.
Of course, the same problem exists with general backup technology - tape  
the size of modern disks is not really affordable anymore.
