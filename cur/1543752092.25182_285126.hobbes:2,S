Speaking of fall-out, or more like trickle-down,
I'm almost done with a patch to make PCMCIA resources use
unsigned long instead of u_int or u_short for IO address:
incluce/pcmcia/cs_types.h:
#if defined(__arm__) || defined(__mips__)
typedef u_int   ioaddr_t;
#else
typedef u_short	ioaddr_t;
#endif
becomes:
typedef unsigned long	ioaddr_t;
and then include/pcmcia/cs.c needs some changes in use of
ioaddr_t, along with drivers (printk formats).
Does that sound OK?
I guess that it would become unsigned long long (or u64)
with this proposal?
