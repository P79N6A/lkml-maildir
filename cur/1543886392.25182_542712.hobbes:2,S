Here I am dealing with a infiniband (see www.openfabrics.org) network 
device driver. The layer above the
driver is the standard infiniband core interface. Now I have a situation 
where I need to peek into the packets
and do some modifications(some hacking). So I just want know whether I 
can access the original data region
using the bus address generated by the dma_map_single.
FYI, architecture I am working on is x86_64.
