The start/stop methods are not needed to fix the races, they allow better
control of the unload process.

For filesystems it's only simpler because they only have a single entry
point, but the basic problem is always the same. We have to protect
against module load/unload and unregister. Without an interface change we
will have to add module owner pointers everywhere and we will see
contention on the unload_lock due to try_inc_mod_count.
