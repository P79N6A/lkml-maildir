I noticed that if I kill the "artsd" daemon and then
let it naturally restart when starting another music player
the problem goes away for awhile.   When artsd starts using
more than 1.7% of the CPU then the problem occurs.  So I think
I was looking at the wrong code.  Perhaps the problem is with
the daemon.
