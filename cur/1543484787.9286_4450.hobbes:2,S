Hello,
I have here two machines which are identically equipped. Both
have a Tyan S1836DLUAN Thunder 100, 2xPII@400MHz, 128 MB RAM.
At the beginning both had a 2940 Adaptec with three disks.
One of the machines I used to test out new kernels and in
particular the aic7xxx driver. I eventually took out the
2940 adapter and used the onboard AIC-7895 controller.
All worked perfectly exept a thing I just noticed today
when I upgraded the other machine to the same kernel and
took out the 2940 too. Somehow, taking away that controller
and activating the on-board SCSI made the ATAPI CDROM drive
not being recognised anymore by Linux (2.2.1-ac4), it now sais
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
hda: ......................................., ATAPI UNKNOWN (type 14)
drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
while before the message was:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100ative mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: CD-ROM CDU711, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: ATAPI 14X CD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.52
I had already sent a message about this to the kernel list
before and got some replies (for example to say "hda=cdrom")
but none worked, so I lived with it. But only now I realise
that removing the Adaptec and switching over to on-board
SCSI caused this problem.
Does anyone know how to cure it?
Thanx,
         Andres
