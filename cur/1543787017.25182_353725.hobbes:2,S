Not really, this is the sort of thing ulimit is meant for.  To keep processes
from any one user from running away.  It lets you limit the damage it can do,
until such time as you can control it and fix the runaway application.

Ulimit isn't a user-space solution, its a user-_based_ restriction mechanism for
resources.  It allows you to prevent user X (or group X, IIRC) from creating
more than A MB of files, or B processes, or allocating C KB of memory, etc.  man
3 ulimit.
