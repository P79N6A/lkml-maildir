Maintability and clear design as usual.

Finally, even if the above isn't true, I often reject bug-fixes.
Bug-fixes are _often_ worse than the bug they fix, even with serious bugs.
Because a lot of bug-fixes are "band-aid" - not fixing the bug properly.
And band-aid is BAD. It's worse than even a crashing machine. Because
band-aid never goes away, and nobody cleans it up.
Geert, go away. You don't seem to understand what being a maintainer
means. It means saying no to crap.

It was said long ago. You KNEW that it's how linux is developed when you are
switched to it. So you must accept this style of development or go to other
camp (FreeBSD, NetBSD, HURD or even MAC OS or BeOS -- there are enough).

It's YOUR house so it's up to you to decide. Linux is Linus's pet so it's to
him to decide.

And still patch was presented mainly as security fix :-) Guess why ? Since
new features are MUCH less encouraged in deep code-freeze (let alone stable
branch).

Kernel DOES NOT shoot iself in the foot with bad HDIO_DRIVE_CMD parameters.
It's not kernel interface at all. It's more like fclose(3) : GLibC will do
some things with FILE * enveliope and then will pass filehandle to close(2).
It WILL NOT try to safeguard kernel from itself.

Even if parameters were given to kernel just to be passed in other place ?
Huh.

Not at all. We know some functions are dangerous (like chown, for example).
Thus not everyone can use them. This function is dangerous due to bad hardware
design. I makes no difference: FOR KERNEL all possible HDIO_DRIVE_CMD are safe.
Just like UID=500 for chown is not better then UID=15. Still FOR SYSTEM AS
WHOLE (usersapce+kernel+hardware) there are BIG difference. So call is
restricted so only tructed processes can issue chown or HDIO_DRIVE_CMD.
This is ALL protection kernel can (and should) offer.

The only problem is that said code is in HDD firmware, NOT in kernel.

As such it does not belond to 2.4 kernel in code-freeze time.

Kernel-specific binary kernel modules are somehow better ?

Since it's NOT inteface for firmware upgrades. It CAN BE used for this. It
can be used for other things as well. Plus we HAVE NO information needed to
do sanity checks.
