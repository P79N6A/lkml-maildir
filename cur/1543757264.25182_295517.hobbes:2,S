just to make sure that the context of this discussion is not lost to
David and other readers of lkml. We are not redesigning softirqs in any
way, shape or form for the normal kernel - there they remain what they
are.
This discussion is about seemless (automatic) extensions/modifications
to the softirq concept on PREEMPT_RT, for latency reduction purposes.
PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS is already such an extension.
