I noticed the same problem that Richard Gooch had:
  time.c: In function `do_gettimeofday':
  time.c:262: fixed or forbidden register was spilled.
  This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm statements or clauses.
I noticed my build and -D__SMP__ due to a configuration error
on my part.  When I re-configured without SMP the compile was
successful with 2.3.30-pre6 and 2.3.30 (official)
I to am using an 'older' gcc
    dd:dcd$ gcc -v
    Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2.1/specs
    gcc version 2.7.2.1
I realize that 2.7.2.1 is not up to 2.7.2.3
 that is documented in Documentation/Changes

PS.  this isn't the first time that enabling/disabling SMP has caused compile
 problems.  Last time this occured was with a structure that
 became zero size when SMP was DISabled, and then the workaround
 was to enable SMP :-).  Now it seems that I can't enable SMP with
 this compiler.
What compiler is Linus using?
