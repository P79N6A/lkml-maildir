note that no matter how much scheduler logic, in the end 
cross-scheduling of tasks between nodes on NUMA will always have a 
permanent penalty (i.e. the 'migration cost' is 'infinity' in the long 
run), so the primary focus _hast to be_ on 'get it right initially' When 
tasks must spill over to other nodes will always remain a special case.  
So balance-on-fork/exec/[clone] definitely needs to be aware of the full 
domain tree picture.
