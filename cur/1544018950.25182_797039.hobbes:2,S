We've discovered many times that doing a workqueue flush with a lock
held is a bad idea.  If any callback takes that lock, or takes some
other lock which someone else takes while holding the original lock,
etc, we deadlock.

Yes, that's a point.

But it's still deadlockable, isn't it?  If you do a work_on_cpu() while
holding a lock, and the callback function takes that lock, deadlock? 
If so, things didn't get much better?

mm..  This is why I'd like to expend a little more effort trying to
avoid having to make this change.
