If that's not part of the roadmap I'd be surprised,
since tux is so much more capable than the
khttpd which is currently part of the tree.
Tux has clearly demonstrated it's performance
and low resource consumption.
I also think including tux in the mainline kernel
would further stimulate development, as folks
begin to realize what they can do with tux....
At least Red Hat seems committed to it.
IMHO of course...
