Release 1.4.3: Mon May 14 01:35:07 EDT 2001
	* Rulesfile sync with 2.4.5-pre2.
It's notable that the configurator codebase has now been unchanged for
ten days.  It's looking really stable now, all the action is in rulesfile
updates and fixes.

Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there
be one, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of
blindfolded fear.... Do not be frightened from this inquiry from any
fear of its consequences. If it ends in the belief that there is no
God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and
pleasantness you feel in its exercise...
	-- Thomas Jefferson, in a 1787 letter to his nephew
