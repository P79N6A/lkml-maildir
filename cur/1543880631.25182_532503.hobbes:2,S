Trond,
What is the set of patches that are you testing?  I'd like to give
that a spin tonight as well.
It is possible that what makes my configuration more susceptible
to the problem is the fact that the client significantly overpowers
the server: Athlon x2 4200+ with 2Gb of RAM for the client vs. PIII
1Ghz 512 MB RAM for the server.  They both have gigabit ethernet
and both NICs and the switch support jumbo frames.
Regards,
florin
