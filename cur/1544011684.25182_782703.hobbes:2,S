Hi Alan.
Can I ask you to persuade this a bit more?
1) when it fails try using "make V=1" and post the command executed.
1a) Do the same when it works and compare the two
2) try to do: make path/file.i and check if the generated .i file
   differ when it fails and when it is ok.
Other than that I have no ideas for the moment.
