It does not seem to work like that here. I'm not sure what the exact
rules are, but I know that I sometimes have C4 and sometimes not. I
have C4 now, and it is used, even when I'm on AC power. Thinkpad X32.

Yes... OTOH it is not that bad -- we could simply hardcode data from
acpi BIOS into kernel, ignore what ACPI says, and drive C4 even on AC
power. But that would be hack (tm).

I did not realize ACPI was _that_ clever. Anyway, it is different on
my machine...
