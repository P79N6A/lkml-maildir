X, fbdev apps, gpm ... acceleration curves are typically done in HW,
thus it makes sense in this case to have it in the kernel driver
(besides, it should be fairly simple anyway) when it's in normal mode.
When it's in raw mode for use by the synaptics X driver, if course, it's
expected that those things are to be done by that driver.
