Yes.

I cannot test that part - don't think I have any SmartMedia.

Yes. If I do that, I see:
 <4>  Vendor: eUSB      Model: Compact Flash     Rev:
 <4>  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
 <4>  Vendor: SCM Micr  Model: eUSB SmartMedia   Rev: 0207
 <4>  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
that is, the enabling of CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_SDDR09 turns this reader
into two devices: a CF reader and a SM reader.
Inserting sd.o yields
 Detected scsi removable disk sdb at scsi2, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
 Detected scsi removable disk sdc at scsi2, channel 0, id 0, lun 1
that is, the two logical units of this device turn into sdb (the CF reader)
and sdc (the SM reader). The CF reader contains a card, and reading
capacity is successful:
 SCSI device sdb: 15872 512-byte hdwr sectors (8 MB)
If one makes the MODE SENSE command read the vendor page 0, it succeeds, and:
 sdb: Write Protect is off
There is a single partition on sdb:
   sdb1
On the other hand, sdc does not contain anything, so unsurprisingly:
 sdc : READ CAPACITY failed.

Probably, yes. You might cc me, I am not subscribed to that list.
