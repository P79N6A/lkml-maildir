There are four megaraid-specific patches in -mm:
megaraid-unused-variable.patch
drivers-scsi-megaraidc-add-a-dummy-mega_create_proc_entry-for-proc_fs=y.patch
scsi-megaraid-megaraid_mmc-fix-a-null-pointer-dereference.patch
megaraid_mmmbox-fix-a-bug-in-reset-handler.patch
The final one is your latest patch.
I'll periodically send such patches to the subsystem maintainer until
something happens.
