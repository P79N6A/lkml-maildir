Subject: simple -- who adds stuff to UDP hash?

Hello everybody.
In 2.4.17 net/ipv4/udp.c there is a hash table defined:
struct sock *udp_hash[UDP_HTABLE_SIZE];
In my understanding it should contain all the allocated udp sockets (and
it does, since udp_v4_lookup is able to find one after a new packet
arrives).
_However_, I cannot find a single piece of code which would add a new
socket after it was created. Also, udp_v4_hash is a 'null' function.
Please let me know how new sockets are added to it -- I need it when I
create my own socket in "accept" (my code is based on UDP).

P.S. By sockets I mean 'struct sock'.
