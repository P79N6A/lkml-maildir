Oh my ..., I'm truly sorry. When i've sent this patch to Andrew first time
he ask me to remake it in order to make it less intrusive. When later 
i've found what patch was buggy because of incorrect int to loff_t conversion
isize = i_size_read(inode) & ~(blksize - 1);
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Later i've missed when this patch was accepted some days ago :(.
