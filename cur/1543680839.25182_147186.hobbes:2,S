For soem reason it looks like my first post did not go
thru.  I am sending this again.  SOrry if it posts
twice
I unsubcribed from softhome.net and subscribed
with this address.  Softhome did not give me enough
space.
Anyhow I think I know what the problem is?  Its with
the modprobe.conf.
I updated both my mkinitrd and mod-utils with the aid
of Paul Nasrat.  I dunno if you know who he is.
Anyhow when I run "generate-modprobe.conf >
/etc/modprobe.conf
I see that the the sections for "usb-uhci" "mousedev"
and "keybdev".   Those are incorrect.  They should be
"uhci-hcd", "usbmouse" and "usbkbd".  Once I changed
the "usb-uhci" to "uhci-hcd"  at least the usb
installed ok but those changes I made for the mouse
and keyboard still does not work.
Is there something screwed up somewhere else?
If I rerun  "generate-modprobe.conf >
/etc/modprobe.conf
Everything defaults back to "usb-uhci", "mousedev" and
keybdev"?
WHy I am not sure.
Is there a fix for this to get the modprobe.conf to
correlate to the new kernel modules?
