Subject: Very poor performance with 2.6.4

Hello!
I tested kernel 2.6.4. While compiling kdelibs and kdebase, I felt, that
kernel 2.6 seems to be slower than 2.4.25.
So I did some tests to compare the performance directly. Therefore I
rebooted for everey test in init 2 (no X).
I locally compiled 2.6.5rc2 3 times under 2.6.4 and under 2.4.25 on a
reiserfs LVM partition, which resides onto a IDE HD (using DMA) and got
the following result:
In the middle, compiling under kernel 2.6.4 tooks 9.3% more real time than
under 2.4.25.
The user-processortime is about the same, but the system-processortime is
under 2.6.4 32.9% higher than under 2.4.25.
Now, I switched off preemption. But the performance isn't much better:
8.8% (9.3% with preemption) more real-time compared to 2.4.25 and 28%
(32.9% with preepmtion) more system-time.
Does anybody know, how to get the same performance under 2.6.4 (or even
better) as under 2.4.25?
