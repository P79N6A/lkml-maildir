I managed to keep the page aging of each zone balanced in the patch:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112856866504476&w=2
Zones in nearby nodes are also made balanced somewhat.
The ages are currently measured by accumulated number of pages pushed into lru.
I wonder that has the side effect of making other activities of each zone
roughly balanced, too. It needs some testing. If so, we can just sum up counters
of each zone in the current node.
