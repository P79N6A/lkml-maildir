Alan did something in 2.2.2-ac7 that fixed this for us (we got our first
SMP machine that had to use quotas a week or so ago and I put on
2.2.2-ac1...it blew up as soon as I turned on quotas and typed "sync").
Upgrading to ac7 on that machine has fixed/avoided the problem from what I
can see (it's running fine for a few days now :)).
