I can trivially do that... but for testing people can download all the
stuff (taking uptodate all the stuff in one patch saves me tons of time ;).

Currently the only entry points for the lru list are quite clear in my
mind and there's no confusion so currently the safety is not an issue.
And in general I think it's desiderable taking things in a unused_list
when you are able to _recycle_ them. In the pagemap case the recycling
thing make no sense.
Gerard, really many thanks for reading my code and for commenting it!
