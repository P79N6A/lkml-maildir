I stand corrected. Fred Reimer evidently thinks the "stable" kernels
should not be stable.

Right now, most investment banks on Wall Street are Solaris shops. Even
with Solaris, they pretty much all roll their own distributions--based on
Sun's distribution of course. They standardize on a set of patches, and
gnu-ify the tools, as well as adding their own libraries. If Linux gets
adopted on Wall Street, I expect it will be the same: They will take a
distribution and then heavily modify it and forever diverge from it.

The key thing here is whether or not Linus thinks that "stable" kernels
should be only for developers. If Linus thinks that (which I doubt), then
perhaps it is time to rename the kernel series. Even numbered kernels
could be called developmental and odd numbered kernels could be called
experimental. However, I really don't think that is what Linus (or most of
the Linux community) wants.
