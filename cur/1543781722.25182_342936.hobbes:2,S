You have to ask yourself, "What environment?". And, what it would
be used for.
Environment variables are some strings that exist in a processes'
name-space. The kernel is not a process. There are some strings
in the kernel, mostly relating to error messages, but there is
no conceptual use for an 'environment'. Since the kernel performs
functions on behalf of calling tasks, at that time, its environment
is the environment of the caller.
Now, there are environment strings set up for the very first
task by the kernel. This environment normally becomes the
environment of 'init'. (/usr/src/linux-`uname -r`/init/main.c)
This is just a "place-holder" and currently contains "HOME=/"
and "TERM=linux".
Cheers,
