That didn't help, but I found the problem: APM. I had GNOME battery_applet
running, and that checks /proc/apm every 2 seconds (default value).
Removing the applet from the taskbar solved the problem, and as soon as
I do "cat /proc/apm" the audio stops for about a second.
I recompiled the kernel with CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS enabled, in the hope
that the USB interrupts would still come through, but that didn't solve
it. 
I'm glad I finally found the problem, but how to solve it? Is this a
bug in APM or in USB?
