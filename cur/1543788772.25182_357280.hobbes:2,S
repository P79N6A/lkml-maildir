Thus, someone could use bootloaders to "patch" the kernel: If the
bootloader writes a string of arbitary length to some memory region,
then there is a fair chance that if you make the string just long
enough, the kernel image gets (partly) overwritten. It resembles a bit
"Smashing the stack for fun and profit", but this time, it's "Rewriting
the kernel to your own needs via the bootloader on x86" :)
Same thing for user defined COMMAND_LINE_SIZE. I think that a common
interface for boot loaders is required. Especially in uncontrolled multi
user environments like Universities, everything else could lead to
undesired results.
Greetings,
Georg
