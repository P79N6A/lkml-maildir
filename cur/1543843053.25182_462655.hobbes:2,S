I wasted a day to track it down, unfortunally it's for me completly
unclear how this commit s related to IDE, it could be some
timing issue, but that is just guessing.
With  77ba89c5cf28d5d98a3cae17f67a3e42b102cc25 (linux-2.6 tree) i don't have a
problem (i booted it 21 times until now and it allways worked) and 
b29739f902ee76a05493fb7d2303490fc75364f4 is the first bad commit.
So this seems to be the "offender":

    [PATCH] pi-futex: scheduler support for pi
For convenience the diff is also here:
http://debian.christian-leber.de/idebad.patch
I have really no remote idea what is happening.
BTW: I have seen this problem too on a box with a intel BX440, but only
one time.
