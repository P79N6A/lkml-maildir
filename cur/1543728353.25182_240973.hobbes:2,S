Even less "interesting", but what *I*'d like to be able to do is:
# dump -0 -B 700000 -f /dev/hdb -u -z3 /home
and then just swap to the next CD/RW after -B blocks...
Dumping to a 700M temp file and then cdrecord'ing the temp file really gets old
after 15 or 20 CD's (and even playing double-buffering games using -F to switch
around isn't all it's cracked up to be..)
