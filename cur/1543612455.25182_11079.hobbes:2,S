Hi.
At least since 2.4.17-pre4 and -pre5 devfs is not handling permissions in the
right way with ALSA:
rene@jackson:/dev > l dsp sound/dsp 
ls: sound/dsp: Permission denied
lr-xr-xr-x   1 root     root            9 Dec  7 00:14 dsp -> sound/dsp
rene@jackson:/dev > cd sound/
bash: cd: sound/: Permission denied
rene@jackson:/dev > 
rene@jackson:/dev > l snd
ls: snd/..: Permission denied
ls: snd/.: Permission denied
ls: snd/controlC0: Permission denied
ls: snd/controlC1: Permission denied
ls: snd/timer: Permission denied
ls: snd/midiC0D0: Permission denied
ls: snd/pcmC0D2p: Permission denied
ls: snd/pcmC0D1c: Permission denied
ls: snd/pcmC0D0p: Permission denied
ls: snd/pcmC0D0c: Permission denied
ls: snd/midiC1D0: Permission denied
ls: snd/pcmC1D0p: Permission denied
ls: snd/pcmC1D0c: Permission denied
total 0
They all have 666 (or 777 for dirs)! It is possible to this as root.
Also loading the modules gives me:
