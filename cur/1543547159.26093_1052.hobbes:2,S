	I have just put together a table of what works and what doesn't
under 2.4-test5. All I know for sure is that cdrecord 1.6 compiled against
2.2.16 and running under 2.2.16 works flawlessly. Attached is the results.
	As you can see I compiled against both the 2.2.16 trees and
2.4.0-test5 ones. Though I only ran it under 2.4. I suspect it would
prolly work better under 2.2.16 but then again that is what I am noticing
:) cdrecord is doing strange things in the later kernels? I'm not using
SMP though, which in theory might make things easier to track???
How do I go about seting up a loop through device before the sg driver
just out of interest?
Don't know if this is any good. It's never very much corruption just a few
bytes here and there? Or in this case a chunk of them

Hmmmm I'm beginnning to see a pattern now..? 8 bytes????
Q. Is though.. why just these 3 files with the latest version of cdrecord?
Arrrrg this is gonna drive me nuts?!
;)
Will this enlighten us all I wonder?
Cheers,
