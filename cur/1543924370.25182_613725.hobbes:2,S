Yep, this fixes suspend/resume on my X61 thinkpad.  Interestingly I'm
not seeing any power savings with ALPM set to min_power, at least not
compared to what I get after suspend and resuming (which mysteriously
cause the power utilization of my laptop to drop by a watt --- maybe
that is engaging ALPM as part of the suspend process?  I dunno).
