    I think you misunderstood me. I mean does this work for the root FS?
No, it doesn't, since this is a feature of the mount program, not
of the kernel. However, it is possible to boot Linux with a ramdisk
and then also to use this for the (later) root device.
That construction is also required when the root device is on a disk
that has a partition table of a type not understood by the kernel.
