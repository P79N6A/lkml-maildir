Hello,
the congestion control will work with both code changes, but i am
not sure, if using clear_queue_congested() and blk_congestion_wait()
is the right thing to use here: it works on global level. Any other
thread/driver/etc. can do a clear_queue_congested() and wake
up anyone waiting on this global write or read wait queue, resulting to
unneeded task switches.
The driver local solution (own waitqueue) would prevent this.....
