 Well, it is up to the maintainer of code in question to get it right if 
interested.  Otherwise having no annotation and leaving the relevant 
strings resident in the memory throughout the lifespan of the system is a 
valid and perfectly working option.
 If you worry about the reverse case, where an annotation should be 
removed because the containing function is no longer __*init*/__*exit*, 
then I think `modpost' does a reasonably good job finding such places.
