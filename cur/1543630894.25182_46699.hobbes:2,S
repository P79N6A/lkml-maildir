Actually, the "install behavior" is quite nice.  I wrote a script that 
installs the kernel and sets it up in the right way for my 
non-kbuild-2.5 kernel... much of this script is doing stuff like getting 
the current kernel version, etc... the new kbuild allows you to specify 
the install script you want to use and exports a bunch of variables that 
make this script easier to write.  Moreover, I believe there is a 
default install that mimicks that of the current kernel so that the 
changing of install's behavior is not mandatory.
