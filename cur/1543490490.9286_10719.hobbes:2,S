Indeed. The one queue thing is for each blk_dev_struct structure and not
the IO request pool.

But it is one pool that is too limited for modern SCSI technology, btw.

Hmmm ... Didn't locate this virtual 'one queue' for now.

Losing time is another concern. Not queuing a request which is ready for 
IO and queuable to the device (based on controller and device configured
limits) is what I understood as 'one queue' misbehaviour.
For SCSI 'one queue per controller' would be a bad approach. The queuing
must be achieved per device. The controller/BUSES are resources (with some
limits) you have to use for IOs to be transported between the kernel IO
sub-system and the devices.

It should not be a define, in my opinion, if we want the kernel IO
sub-system resources to scale the actual hardware IO system.

One hardwired pool once booted not based on actual IO hardware is not 
that appropriate for SCSI.
It is set to 64 in 2.2.3, but it has been 128 for a long time.
That's poor for SCSI.

There is always room for improvement. The SCSI layer has just been dropped
since a too long time. And AWK (as we know :-) ), Linux has great success
despite its SCSI layer. ;-)

Will study that.

Leonard's opinion will be welcome.
The main reason could be, in my opinion, that the semantic of the SCSI
layer is useless when we have to glue an abstraction of 'blocks' to
another abstraction of 'blocks'.
