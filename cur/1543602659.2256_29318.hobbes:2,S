If you're going to try this out on a C3 btw, heed the warning at the
top of the code :) This still needs quite a bit of work.
I just need to find the time to sit down and finish it.
(The x86 bits are all thats preventing Russell from saying
 "This is ready" iirc, so I should get that finished at some point soon)
I'd like to add Transmeta Longrun support to it too, but that can
come later, when I get access to one.
regards,
Dave.
