No, I was running 2.3 with a non-overclocked BP6 running 400MHz Celerons and
I was getting the messages (66MHz bus speed).  I'm currently running 2.2 due
to some problems I haven't had time to look at yet with the 3c59x driver in
2.3;  My impression was that either the 2.3 kernel or the new BIOS available
from ABIT made the mobo lock up quicker; however I don't have anythign
scientific to back that up.  I might be able to look at it a bit more after
the holidays, however it's difficult to know since if I try to back out to
the old BIOS, Linux GPFs on boot up.
Perhaps someone should start a linux-bp6 mailing list?
