Subject: [CFT] FAT patch v13 (beta)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/4/21/7

News:
	The rest of fat_readdirx() fixed (pair of buffer overruns +
work with inumbers). Small VFAT cleanup.
TODO:
	More testing ;-)
	Interaction of knfsd and new FAT code (actually it's not
restricted to FAT - reexport of SMBFS over NFS has problems too;
code in question sits in get_parent_ino() and friends). Practically
it's not too severe (who wants to combine NFS suckitude with FAT one?),
but the situation is *really* wrong.
	real UMSDOS cleanup.
Please, help with testing. It's still beta, so be careful.
	Patch (against 2.2.6) lives on 
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/fat-patch-13.gz
  							Cheers,
  								Al
