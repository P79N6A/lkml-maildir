.. which was exactly what I said:
 "..every single spinlock in the kernel assumes that the kernel isn't
  preempted, which means that user apps that can preempt the kernel
  cannot use them."
Karim, I don't _need_ to download RTAI or ask you questions about how it
works, because this is fundamental "RT-101" stuff. This is what priority
inversion is all about: if you make user land more important than the
kernel, it _cannot_ stay RT and use kernel services.
I went on to say:
   "Karim claims to give "user land" hard-real-time abilities, but the
    fact is, it's not "user land" any more. it's a limited shadow, and a
    _perversion_ of what user land is supposed to be all about."
Which certainly should have told you that I understood the limitations of
RTAI very well indeed. And I reject them.
