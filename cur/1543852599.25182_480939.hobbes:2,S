The failure can manifest itself in many ways, I have
only seen it as a read failure, but there should be no
reason why it cannot also show as a write failure.
It should be in the later vanilla kernels, it won't
be in the earlier ones,  I would do a
find /lib/modules -name "*edac*" -ls
It is a hw issue, either something is running faster that
it should be (pci bus set to fast for the given hardware/config)
or something is broken.
