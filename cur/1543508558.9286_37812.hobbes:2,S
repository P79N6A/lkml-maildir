I'm about to provide feedback to Real wrt their Real Player G2 Alpha for Linux.
 On kernel 2.2.5-2.2.10 the video would lose sync with the audio every time. 
Now I'm running it under 2.3.16 and the problem is gone.  The G2 works
perfectly.  Does anyone know to what kernel hack I can attribute this to?
I'm running a stock 2.3.16, heavily modified Redhat 6.0, and Accellerated X for
laptops.  Pentium II 266 w/ 96M.
