The thing is, if you have git, you can basically already do this.
Do a script like this:
	#!/bin/sh
	git log --since=6.months.ago -- "$@" |
		grep -i '^    [-a-z]*by:.*@' |
		sort | uniq -c |
		sort -r -n | head
and it gives you a rather good picture of who is involved with a 
particular subdirectory or file.
A much *better* picture than some manually maintained thing, in fact, 
because it tells you who really does the work, and which way patches go...
(Maybe you want to add a
	grep -v '\(Linus Torvalds\)\|\(Andrew Morton\)'
to avoid seeing the normal chain too much, but hey, we probably want to 
know too. Anyway - the script can certainly be tweaked, the point is 
really just that the git tree _already_ contains the relevant 
information).
