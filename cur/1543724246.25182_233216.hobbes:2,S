David, inet6device area is created when we create first address.
The first address is likely link-local address based on
mac address, and kernel detects address duplication and 
delete the inet6device.  Finally, we don't have inet6device.

I'd suggest following approach.
 1. support up/down via netlink interface.
 2. add IFLA_IFID (or something like that) (RTM_NEWLINK attribute)
    inet6 layer create inet6device without an address
    when receiving this.
User will be able to do
 # ip link eth0 up eui64 de:ad:be:ef:ca:fe:ba:be
or something like this.
