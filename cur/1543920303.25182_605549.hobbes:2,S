Hmm, I would have thought you'd find the NUMA bits especially interesting.
Being able to, say, colorize a process' memory map by what nodes its
pages land on could be very telling.

That is a concern. In general, I think getting too cute with page
flags and struct page in general is a bad idea because the rules here
are already so complex/fragile/confusing/underdocumented, but there's
definitely a lot of pressure in that direction.

Referenced, dirty, uptodate, lru, active, slab, writeback, reclaim,
and buddy all look like they might be interesting to me from the point
of view of watching what's happening in the VM graphically in
real-time.
For instance, watching the slab bit I can watch a 'find /' fill up
huge swaths of contiguous dcache memory, then get fragmented to hell
and never recover when I do a large userspace malloc. In other words,
this thing actually lets you see all the crap that happens in the VM
that we usually handwave about.
