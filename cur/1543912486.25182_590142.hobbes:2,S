Thank you for that link Joe.
I'm not sure I agree with the __nocast, but I respect that this is 
the maintainers choice.
But, I still think the first chunk of the patch that removes the 
initial variable initialization makes sense. 
Initializing the variable to NULL is pointless since it'll never be
used before the kmalloc() call. So here's a revised patch that just
gets rid of that little detail.
No need to initialize to NULL when variable is never used before 
it's assigned the return value of a kmalloc() call.
