With DMA off no seek error occurs. When the transfer rate is
limited to UDMA3 I get this:
hda: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xec
Note the difference: the error code is different and
it knows the failed opcode as well. But DMA remains on.
Can it be a bad 80w cable? I don't think so, considering that
it doesn't occur for DVDs when using UDMA4...

The automatic DMA re-enabling would be a good solution.

Unfortunately libata (or pata_amd) doesn't work very well on this machine,
I tried to switch to libata for the CD drive but it lost the DVD-playing 
capability.
It seems the error was that libdvdcss couldn't get the keys via the scd 
device.
This is the main obstacle that stops me switching to Fedora 7 from FC6.
I reported it some time ago but got no answer. Look for subject
"DVD-playing, ide-cd vs scsi-cd drivers".
