Ouch.  I've been using the tty name in $HISTFILE for some time now
(at least on laptops and workstations); I do not see any reasonable
alternative to prevent overwriting while still saving history.
Will patching in the old behavior wrt re-use, while not disrupting
the other improvements, be a lot of work?  I've looked thru the src, 
but haven't yet spotted the point where the new pis number is chosen.
