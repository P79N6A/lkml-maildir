For raid0, the md driver just redirects requests to the right drive.
It doesn't explicitly serialise or parallelise anything. 2.4 works in
exactly the same was as 2.2.
With a 2MB chunksize, I would expect a linear read to touch just one
drive at a time.
With a 4K chunk size, I suspect that an linear read would read from
all the drives in parallel.
You say that you reformatted to 2MB chunksize.  What did you reformat
from?
