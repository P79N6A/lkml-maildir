yes an hole tree.

indexed by the hole start address? then it's still O(N), then your quick
cache for the first hole would not be much different. I above meant hole
size, then it would be O(log(N)), but it wouldn't defragment anymore.

exactly, it's still O(N).
The final solution needed isn't a plain tree, it needs modifications to
the rbtree code to make the data structure more powerful, that will
provide that info in O(log(N)) without an additional tree and starting
from the left (i.e. it won't alter the retval of get_unmapped_area, just
its speed).  the design is just finished for some time, what's left is
to implement it and it isn't trivial ;).
Anyways this O(log(N)) complexity improvement is needed anyways, old
applications will be still around in particular when they will find they
don't need special API to work fast.
