Well, the 2.5.59 BK tree shows that function using block_truncate_page() as
well.
The question is why did the Jan 9 changeset in the 2.5.55 timeframe not
appear in the tree until post-2.5.59.  Maybe on Jan 9 Linus only part-merged
it by some means (making the web interface claim it is there), and this week
completed the merge and updated the checkin comment?
