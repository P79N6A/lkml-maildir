Don't know if it's specific to this kernel, but as I have realized it now...
I booted with idle=poll to check some issues (with nvidia driver, btw).
And suddenly I noticed my box was running near 80ºC hot.
I pulled out the lid, an try to see what happened.
In short, idle=poll rises the temperature about 20ºC.
I have an ASUS PC-DL mobo, with a couple Xeon Northwood with HypertThreading
at 2.4 GHz, for a total of 4 threads.
If I boot the box with idle=poll, and let it doing _nothing_ but staring at
the gnome desktop, I get this temperatures:
(Time,VRM,CPU0,CPU1) (wihtout the side cover, remember...)
15:46 64 56 54
15:55 70 60 56
16:02 71 62 57
If I reboot without idle=poll, the box colds quickly:
16:07 58 52 48
16:12 50 43 42
16:15 49 42 41
I I put the box to do some multithreaded render, so all four cores stay
above 98% usage, the box warms again:
16:17 51 43 42
16:24 67 57 54
16:28 70 60 56
16:30 72 61 57
16:37 72 61 56
And as soon as I stop the work, it colds again:
16:41 71 60 56
16:42 64 56 52
16:43 60 54 50
16:45 55 48 46
16:46 53 46 44
Left alone for awhile, it stays at 46 39 39 (for VRM and both CPUs, as I said).
Is idle=poll a quick and dirty way to burn your box in flames ?
To warm your cpu doing nothing ?
Summer is coming, but this...
Any ideas ?
