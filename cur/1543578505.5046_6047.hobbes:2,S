As previously reported by someone, there are occasional
problems when shutting down with unmounting partitions,
that are reported as busy for strange reasons.
Keith Owens said it was supposedly a Redhat shutdown
script issue and I since I'm not using Redhat, it's
most likely not that.
Upon fscking after reboot, I always have errors on a 
single inode and it's always the same one:
/dev/hdb1: Inode 522901, i_blocks is 64, should be 8. FIXED
Can someone tell me an easy and reliable way of figuring
out which file (program) uses said inode? I think that's
probably the key to figuring out why the partition is
busy on umount.
-Udo.
