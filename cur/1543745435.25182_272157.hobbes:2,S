Sorry, by "right hashes" I meant adding them with hashes 0 and 2 but in
the correct place in the stream; so if we do have a hash collision on
major-hash==0, we'll get ".." slightly out of order, but will still
correctly provide all the entries.  And your second patch seems to do
exactly that.  Thanks!

Looks good to me --- have you tested it much?
The only remaining thing I can think of is what happens if the while()
loop at the end of ext3_htree_fill_tree() exits successfully after
filling in hash-major==0.  Then we'll restart at 2 next time, and will
return ".." twice. 
I'm not sure that's actually possible, though.  Moving the filling-in of
".." into the while loop would deal with this rare possibility.
