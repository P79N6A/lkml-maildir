One of Linus' rhetorical requirements for the syslets work is that we be
able to wait for the result without spending overhead building up state
in some completion context.  The userland rings in the current syslet
patches achieve that and don't seem outrageously complicated.
I have a hard time getting worked up about this particular piece of the
puzzle, though.  If people are excited about *only* providing a pollable
fd to collect the syslet completions, well, great, whatever.

Yup.
