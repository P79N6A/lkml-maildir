I wouldn't guess that even a 15K drive would take nearly that long. For 
boot time on servers it doesn't matter much though, disk spinup time is 
in the noise compared to the insane BIOS delays on most of them during 
bootup. Like on some servers (ahem.. IBM) which have about a 15 second 
delay on the main BIOS screen, 10 second delays on every network boot 
ROM, a 1 minute delay on the SCSI controller before it even starts 
scanning the bus, then another good 10 seconds before it starts booting. 
Gets annoying after a few reboots..
