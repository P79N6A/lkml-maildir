Hi,
Suspend-to-Dsk via Software Suspend seems to work fine -- however,
Suspend-to-RAM doesn't.
When I echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep it goes into sleep mode as it should
and it awakes as it should. However, my mouse in X then is really
confused and does not do what I want it to do.
On the tthy then there is written:
psmouse.c: Wheel Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization,
throwing 2 bytes away.
I need to reboot :/
This "mouse" is a trackpad if that helps..
If you need some more infos, mail me..
Grüße/Regards,
René
