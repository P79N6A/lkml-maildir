Ingo's helping me get the info together on this for putting a MARS-NWE
tux module in 
the kernel.  He had to go do some things this week he told me before he
would be ready
to look at it.  He did point me over to the info, and I agreed we would
attempt to 
implement it as something to look at.  If it performs well enough, I
will have 
something reasonable to send out to Novell Resellers (CNEs) and
Cutomers.
