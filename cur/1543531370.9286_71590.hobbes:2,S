Turns out that the problem was an unnecessary 'hdparm -d 1 /dev/XXX'.
The error message is:
  Mar 22 18:30:13 labridge kernel: hdh: timeout waiting for DMA
  Mar 22 18:30:13 labridge kernel: ide_dmaproc: choppiest supported
ide_dma_timeout func only: 12
  Mar 22 18:30:13 labridge kernel: hdh: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy
}
  Mar 22 18:30:13 labridge kernel: hdh: DMA disabled
  Mar 22 18:30:13 labridge kernel: ide3: reset: success
However, running some stress test scripts on dual PII/400 I observed
this:
 
  1) 2.3.XX is much faster on sequential IO (ala dd if=/dev/hde
of=/dev/null) then 2.2.x
  2) Alas, 2.3.XX locks up under this load:
         dd if=/dev/hde of=/dev/null &
         dd if=/dev/hdf of=/dev/null & 
         dd if=/dev/hdg of=/dev/null &
         dd if=/dev/hdh of=/dev/null &
      This runs OK for hours using DMA, but adding:
         rsh server "cat /dev/zero" > /dev/null
      (Gives close to 100 Mbit/s)
      Gives errors like this within 10 seconds or so:
Mar 22 18:54:17 labridge kernel: ide_dmaproc: choppiest supported
ide_dma_lostirq func only: 11
Mar 22 18:54:17 labridge kernel: hdf: lost interrupt
Mar 22 18:54:17 labridge kernel: ide_dmaproc: choppiest supported
ide_dma_lostirq func only: 11
Mar 22 18:54:17 labridge kernel: hdh: lost interrupt
Mar 22 18:54:27 labridge kernel: ide_dmaproc: choppiest supported
ide_dma_lostirq func only: 11
Mar 22 18:54:27 labridge kernel: hde: lost interrupt
Mar 22 18:54:27 labridge kernel: ide_dmaproc: choppiest supported
ide_dma_lostirq func only: 11
Mar 22 18:54:27 labridge kernel: hdg: lost interrupt
Mar 22 18:54:37 labridge kernel: ide_dmaproc: choppiest supported
ide_dma_lostirq func only: 11
 
      Processes accessing the devices locks and eventually dies after
kill -9.
      All devices attached to the 20262 are effectively dead after this.
      (Have tried both 3c90x and tulip network cards)     
      Same problem if maxcpus=1 or if DMA is not set.
This problem does not happen in 2.2.x.
