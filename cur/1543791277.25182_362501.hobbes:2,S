Subject: [PATCH 2.6.13] airo.c: remove delay in airo_get_scan
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Remove 3 second delay in airo_get_scan. Testing shows this delay is unnecessary. Users of NetworkManager
find this delay make NetworkManager slow to connect.
