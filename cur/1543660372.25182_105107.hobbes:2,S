rsize/wsize have in principle nothing to do with the blocksize that
'stat' returns. The f_bsize value specifies the 'optimal transfer
block size'. Previously this has been set to the rsize/wsize, but when
you add in O_DIRECT, then 32k becomes too large a value to align
to. For this reason, the f_bsize value was changed to reflect the
actual block size used by the *server*.
