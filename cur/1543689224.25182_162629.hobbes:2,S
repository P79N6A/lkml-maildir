Looks like it is, David, you are the one who knows the PCS stuff ...
BTW. David: Any reason why you wouldn't let me change all occurences
of spin_{lock,unlock}_irq into the ...{save,restore} versions ?
I don't like force re-enabling interrupts the way we do it now with
spin_unlock_irq() the way we do it now. Among other things, that
breaks SA_INTERRUPT semantics and that breaks some pet project of
mine which is to run the IRQ handler with interrupts off when the
kernel stack is below a given threshold (to limit interrupt depth)
