So why is the function that gets me one of these "higher order pages"
called "get_free_pages" with an "s"? :)
Christoph's patch is bigger than it needs to be because he has to
change all the occurrences of clear_page(x) to clear_page(x, 0), and
then he has to change a lot of architectures' clear_page functions to
be called _clear_page instead.  If he picked a different name for the
"clear a higher order page" function it would end up being less
invasive as well as less confusing.
The argument that clear_page is called that because it clears a higher
order page won't wash; all the clear_page implementations in his patch
are perfectly capable of clearing any contiguous set of 2^order pages
(oops, I mean "zero-order pages"), not just a "higher order page".
Paul.
