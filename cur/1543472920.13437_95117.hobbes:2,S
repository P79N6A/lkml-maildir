The actual proposal was poll() (not select()) flags to block waiting on 
specific events (changes to a directory or a file).  This allows select() to 
behave as it currently does but allows programs which know about poll() to 
more efficiently wait on file/directory change events (a file manager would 
wait on a directory and update its display, and tail could wait on file 
extend instead of doing a non-blocking read once a second).
IIRC aio support is already in progress (already there?) and glibc 2.1 is adding the userspace support.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
