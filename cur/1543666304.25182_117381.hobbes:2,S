Exactly that.  ld seeks all over the file when adding new blocks to it, so
with ext2 and ext3 (at least) there is poor correspondence between file
offset and block indices.
I recently compiled distccd:
mnm:/usr/src/distcc-1.1> 0 bmap distccd
0-0: 4544516-4544516 (1)
1-1: 4544519-4544519 (1)
2-2: 4544525-4544525 (1)
3-3: 4544531-4544531 (1)
4-4: 4544536-4544536 (1)
5-5: 4544540-4544540 (1)
6-6: 4544520-4544520 (1)
7-7: 4544528-4544528 (1)
8-8: 4544539-4544539 (1)
9-9: 4544521-4544521 (1)
10-10: 4544524-4544524 (1)
11-12: 4544526-4544527 (2)
13-14: 4544529-4544530 (2)
15-18: 4544532-4544535 (4)
19-20: 4544537-4544538 (2)
21-26: 4544541-4544546 (6)
27-40: 4544549-4544562 (14)
41-42: 4544522-4544523 (2)
43-43: 4544518-4544518 (1)
44-45: 4544547-4544548 (2)
And then I copied it:
mnm:/usr/src/distcc-1.1> 0 bmap /usr/local/bin/distccd
0-11: 3913857-3913868 (12)
12-45: 3913870-3913903 (34)
