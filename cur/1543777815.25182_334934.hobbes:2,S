Thanks.  Before I forget I want to ack this.  I think you are correct
and I have a hunch on what might be done to fix this but I haven't found
the couple of hours needed to handle that.
In essence I don't believe the semantics of the reboot path are consistent
between the expectations of the various functions and I my patches stirred
the pot so a different set of things work and fail now than before.
Roughly for your part of the problem the acpi shutdown code needs to
get called sooner when interrupts are still enabled.
