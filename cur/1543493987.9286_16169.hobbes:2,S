I'm interested in this too.  Tony's point was my immediate thought:
pthread_cond_signal is an obvious implementation of a solution to the
'thundering herd' problem. But it has apparently been discounted.
I had assumed that this was because of some limitation to the linux
pthread implementation.  I had read (somewhere, recently) that linux
pthreads in a process were not scheduled independently by the kernel,
but were scheduled only within that process, thus only get a single
kernel scheduling slot.  This is a real limitation. But Matt Ranney
has said on this list that: 
	<snip> Linux pthreads are all kernel processes, <snip>
True?  I'll go find the answers on my own, but I'm curious about the
answer to Tony Gale's question.
