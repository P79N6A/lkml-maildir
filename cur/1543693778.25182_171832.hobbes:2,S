I've got a patch against RedHat's 2.4.x kernel with some version of O(1)
scheduler that migrates all processes off a CPU and makes it ineleigible to
run new tasks.  When the syscall returns, it is safe to remove the CPU.
Processes that are running or sleeping and can be migrated elsewhere are
migrated.  Running processes that have set_cpus_allowed to ONLY the
processor in question are marked TASK_UNRUNNABLE and moved off the runqueue.
Sleeping processes that have set_cpus_allowed to ONLY the processor in
question are left unmolested until they wake up, at which point they will be
marked UNRUNNABLE.
It was done to allow software to bring CPUs on/offline, but it should work
for this.  IRQs not done yet, either.
