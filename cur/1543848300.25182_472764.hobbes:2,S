I'd try with this:
- minimal workable config with a lot of debugging turned on (e.g. no:
smp, floppy, parport, mouse, ipv6, video, clock modulation, apm, acpi
buttons, thermal etc. - only base acpi or no if possible),
- 2.4 kernel,
- other distro e.g. live-cd knoppix,
- other transfer method like ftp (all superfluous services turned off).
