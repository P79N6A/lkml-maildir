You now have an access through a pointer via a function call (the module
can't know what it'll find at the other end of said pointer). Overhead that
makes a lot of sense for spinlock operations carefully optimized to be a
couple of inlined instructions in the common no-contention case, if they
are needed, or nothing at all elsewhere.

Abstraction (source code wise) _is_ extensively used in the kernel. Nobody
really cares what a spinlock_t looks like, or if it was changed from one
release to the next. It is just that via function inlining, use of inline
asm() and plain dirty tricks the runtime cost for abstractions is pushed
down to almost zero, and this is one of the objectives behind Linux. That
level of performance (and the tuning flexibility the current setup affords)
is impossible to achieve (today at least) with binary only stuff.

Right. Interpreted languages (LISP style) are almost as old as compiled
ones (C style) are. You want abstraction, you go for LISP. You want raw
performance, you go for C. Linux is C style.
