Why would he run 'make'? He'll only run 'make modules' since he only
enabled one extra module, and then he expects to be able to load it
without a reboot.
He expects this because it is intuitive ('just a new module') and
because it is true for just about all other modular options in the tree.

It's a matter of taste. As I said, it's your right to disagree.
Some time during 2.7 I'm sure one of the many people who agree with
Adrian and myself will send patches to Linus and he'll get to arbitrate.
