This pretty much contradicts existing experience, most core events are 
rather static - a schedule event is a schedule event no matter how the 
actual scheduler is implemented.
Separate tracepoints are like separate documentation, there are forgotten 
by the developers who could easily keep them uptodate if they were close 
to the source.
