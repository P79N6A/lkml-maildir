Subject: [PATCH][2.5.71] fix x86-64 nmi.c oops on Simics

Andi,
In 2.5, x86-64's nmi.c will semi-enable the local APIC NMI watchdog
on Simics, which leads to a kernel oops if disable_lapic_nmi_watchdog()
is called. The reason is:
1. setup_apic_nmi_watchdog() calls setup_k7_watchdog() for incorrect
   CPU models. Simics is model 8 while we should only allow models 6
   and 15 (well, 6 can't occur).
2. setup_k7_watchdog() initialises nmi_watchdog_msr [which tells others
   that we're enabled], and then tries to wrmsr() the MSRs. This fails
   in Simics with a #GP, you catch the failure and bail out.
3. on return to setup_apic_nmi_watchdog(), the failure goes unnoticed
   and nmi_active is set to 1.
4. Later someone calls disable_lapic_nmi_watchdog(), which, since
   nmi_active == 1, goes ahead and wrmsr()s EVNTSEL0. Bang!
The patch below forces setup_apic_nmi_watchdog() to bail out on unknown
models, so we never get into this half-initialised situation on Simics.
This also merges the code with what's in i386's nmi.c.
With this in place you could remove the error-checking wrmsr()s, but
I didn't bother with that at this time.
