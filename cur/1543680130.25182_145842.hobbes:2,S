In the future, PPC changes should be sent to the linuxppc-dev list at
lists.linuxppc.org, and this has already been fixed in the linuxppc-2.5
tree (which has all of the changes ready to goto Linus, as well as stuff
being worked on for PPC, etc).  This tree is at
bk://ppc.bkbits.net/linuxppc-2.5 or
rsync://source.mvista.com/linuxppc-2.5
