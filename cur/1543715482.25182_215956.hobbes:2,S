-		current->mm->dumpable = 0;
+		current->mm->dump_as_root = 1;
Changes like that break ptrace authentication checks.  Look more closely
at what mm->dumpable is used for, you'll see checks like:
	if (!task->mm->dumpable && !capable(CAP_SYS_PTRACE))
		goto out;
BTW, putting the patch inline makes it easier to comment directly on the
patch.
thanks,
