That's nice.  Now add a second camera from the same vendor
:(  No, i don't expect you to be able to uniquely identify
identical devices being added and removed from a single USB buss
in a persistent way.  But it would be nice if we could get
consistency between busses so that a mouse on one USB buss
weren't confused with a mouse on another USB buss.

Actually you have not answered his question.  And i think it
a reasonable one.  It could be it was answered elsewhere.

I'll try to put slightly differently.  I'll concede that we
cannot positionaly identify USB devices so lets set that
aside for the nonce.  We can persistently, positionaly
identify a device within the HBA context (BUS +ID + LUN) and
should be able to do the same for a PCI HBA (PCI slot +
device) or (PCI bridge topology).
So can i uniquely identify using persistent positional
information a drive at PCI_slot=1, HBA_on_card=0, BUS=0,
ID=1, LUN=0?  And how do i uniquely identify it in the udev
config file so that adding the same model drive in the same
BUS+ID+LUN on an same model HBA card in another PCI slot
does not confuse the two?  If i cannot, can i at least do
the identification so that adding ID=0,LUN=0 to the scsi buss
doesn't cause a name change.
