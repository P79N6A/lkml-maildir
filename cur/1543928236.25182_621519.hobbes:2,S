Maybe the issue is "who can tell" since what is external and what is

Hmm...apparently, there are those that are struggling...

Explicitly documenting what comprises the kernel API (external,
supported) and what comprises the kernel implementation (internal, not
supported).

I think the benefits should include:
- forcing developers to identify their exports as part of the
implementation or as part of the kernel API
- making it easier for reviewers to identify when developers are adding
to the kernel API and thereby focusing the appropriate level of review
to the new function
- making it obvious to developers when they are binding their
implementation to a particular kernel release
