The PCI tree now lives in git:  
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jbarnes/pci-2.6.  There are a 
few branches:
  for-linus - stuff headed to Linus in the next pull request
  linux-next - patches targetted at the following release
  master - unmodified Linus upstream branch
I'll try to avoid re-basing, but since the main downstream tree is the PCI 
hotplug tree, and Kristen uses quilt, that probably won't be much of an 
issue.
If we end up with some big patchsets (like the resource management unification 
benh has been talking about) needing a lot of testing, I may create a 'test' 
or 'all' branch for akpm and others, but I'll keep everyone posted in that 
case.
Thanks,
Jesse
