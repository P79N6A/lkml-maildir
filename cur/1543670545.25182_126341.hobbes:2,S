Hmm... I think I found what caused it. I've mounted a smb share, went into 
a directory on the share, where there are 2 files:
-r--------    1 root     root        48281 Apr 11 21:05 Cats & Dogs (RO).txt
-r--------    1 root     root     730341376 Apr 11 21:04 Cats And Dogs.avi
I typed less Cats<tab>, and then &<tab>, and here it was stuck, and the 
kernel oopsed. If I type less Cats<tab>, and then \&<tab>, it works, but 
without the \ in front of the &, the shell gets stuck in D state.
The remote host, from which I mounted the share, runs 
kernel 2.4.20-gentoo-r1.
