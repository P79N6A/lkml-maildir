Subject: broken __IS_FLG() <linux/fs.h> in 2.4.0-test6-pre?

test6-pre2 changed __IS_FLG() in include/linux/fs.h like this:
-#define __IS_FLG(inode,flg) (((inode)->i_sb && (inode)->i_sb->s_flags & (flg)) \
-				|| (inode)->i_flags & (flg))
+#define __IS_FLG(inode,flg) ((inode)->i_sb->s_flags & (flg))
Note that (inode)->i_sb is now unconditionally dereferenced.
Is this a bug or aren't anonymous i_sb-less inodes permitted anymore?
I have a module which exports "objects" to user-space as anonymous
files, and the underlying inodes have NULL i_sb fields.
This breaks in test6-pre2 and later because mmap(..,MAP_SHARED,..)
calls locks_verify_locked(), which in turn evaluates __IS_FLG()
[via MANDATORY_LOCK and IS_MANDLOCK]. Since test6-pre2 removed
the i_sb NULL test, this causes a NULL pointer dereference.
I can work around this by attaching my inodes to a dummy superblock
a la pipefs, but I'd rather not if I can avoid it.
