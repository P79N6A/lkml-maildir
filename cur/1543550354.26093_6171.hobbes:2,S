If its stable then yes. Minimal FXSAVE in 2.2 may well end up being required
as applications start to use SSE and simply assume it works.
I'm BTW impressed with the final version of the nfs patches, it was the rants
about the old ones that put me off merging it but the latest set has generated
7 emails so far. All positive.
