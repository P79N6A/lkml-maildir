What's funny, is that this actually executes on SPARC hardware, but
immediately segfaults. On Intel hardware though, you get a message similar
to:
zsh: illegal hardware instruction (core dumped)  a.out
I wrote relatively the same program in college. It exploits the F0 0F bug
found in early Pentium hardware.
