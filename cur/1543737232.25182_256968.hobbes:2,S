Agreed.  The whole point of getting realtime-lsm in the kernel is to
make it _easier_ to get a linux audio (or other realtime system) up and
running.  Would it be feasible to use rlimits to let users run
SCHED_FIFO processes?  The ulimit approach would probably be acceptable
if it subsumed all the functionality of the realtime-lsm module.
