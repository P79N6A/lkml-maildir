Indeed. But here we're already assuming the entropy of x and y are
approximately the same as their size.

The debate is really about the merits of F vs the original hash, and
it only came up because I had taken out the folding when trying to
benchmark $subject. My current code gets around that whole debate by
using F for /dev/random and (almost all of) the original hash for
/dev/urandom so we have both paranoid and fast. Now can we please
discuss the merits of $subject?
