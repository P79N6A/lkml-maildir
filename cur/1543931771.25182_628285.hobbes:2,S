I'm afraid to have to say this, but your message (with its broken CC
header) has caused several people to be unsubscribed from this mailing
list.
The reason seems to be that the list expander rejected your message,
which causes bounces to be sent back to mailman for a _ton_ of people.
Strangely enough, I run the exact same check ("headers_syntax") on all
messages the list server receives, and when I test it with your message,
it correctly rejects it.  Yet somehow it didn't earlier.  No idea.
In any case, EVERYONE, please drop the invalid "David," in the CC list.
