yes. We map all RAM from phys address 0 to phys address max linearly on
x86. It will not however map more than 1GB physical - do you expect any
such case to happen?

is there any reason it should not work? We map all physical memory
(including the ROMs below 1MB or any other unusable area mentioned in the
e820 table). More accurately, on x86 we are mapping:
	[0 ... min(max(e820.end), ~1GB)]
