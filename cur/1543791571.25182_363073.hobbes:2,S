For me, it's the big areas that I am interested in, especially if we want
to give HugeTLB pages to a user when they are asking for them. The obvious
one here is database and HPC loads, particularly the HPC loads which may
not have had a chance to reserve what they needed at boot time. These
loads need 1024 contiguous pages on the x86 at least, not 2. We can free
all we want on todays kernels and you're not going to get more than 1 or
two blocks this large unless you are very lucky.
Hotplug is, for me, an additional benefit. For others, it is the main
benefit. For others of course, they don't care, but others don't are about
scalability to 64 processors either but we provide it anyway at a low cost
to smaller machines.

We've never done it but, but we've only supported HugeTLB pages being
reserved at boot time and nothing else as well.
I'm going to setup a kbuild environment, hopefully this evening, and see
are these patches adversely impacting a load that kernel developers care
about. If I am impacting it, oops I'm in some trouble. If I'm not, then
why not try and help out the people who care about the big areas.
