Hi,
I have this problem here on my system since starting to use kernel 
2.6.13's release candidats. Attached you'll find the console output of 
SuSE kernels 2.6.13 (OpenSuSE 10.0) and 2.6.13.2 (OpenSuSE 10.1). The 
latter is "identical" to the output of a self compiled kernel 
2.6.14-rc4, with the .config taken from 2.6.13.2's /proc/config.gz.
How can I further assist in solving this issue?
Bye.
