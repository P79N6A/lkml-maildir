Do you have any suspect hardware in your system?  The reason I ask is
that I have a part time job working in a computer shop where I build and
repair ix86 systems.  I've seen this occasionally when I use a 2.4.X
boot floppy to diagnose system problems.  It hasn't been consistent and
it hasn't happened often enough to correlate with anything else.
I've resolved to keep formal statistics on systems which exhibit this
problem so I would appreciate a cc on any followups to this.
