The idea is fine, but I have some questions about the actual patch:

What was the motivation for this change?  Since the zImage wrapper is
a 32-bit executable, int and long are both 32 bits.  I would prefer to
leave the parameters as unsigned int to force people to realize that
the parameters are 32 bits (even if said people have been working on
64-bit programs recently).

This appears to be the meat of the patch, the rest is "cleanup",
right?
