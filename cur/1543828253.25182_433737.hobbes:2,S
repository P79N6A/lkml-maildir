It's unfortunate - my testing is definitely focussed on x86-64, but
often the same problem(s) exist in i386 too and of course it has 
to be changed there too.

I'm already doing it a bit, but one problem is that i386 has a lot 
more build variants than x86-64. I'll try to do better.
BTW I've been actually considering to reduce the variants a bit - e.g. I think
it doesn't make sense anymore to allow x86 kernels without APIC support
(it can be still disabled at runtime with default set by a config).
