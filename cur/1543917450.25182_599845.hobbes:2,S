You can do both by...
1. Build the modem driver into the kernel.  char drivers are linked in
before ATA ones, so it will attach first.
2. Using a custom initrd with emergency shell.  initrd is loaded by BIOS
so no driver is involved.  I don't actually know how to do this tho.
3. Put in an extra disk controller and boot from it with both drivers
compiled as module.
