Nikita should comment on this.

There was a Usenix paper on profiling based prefetching, does it predate 
the MS patents?
Rik, the more reads you put into the elevator, the more efficiently it 
can sort the reads, so even if latency reduction is not important, 
prefetching can still help (in principle).
