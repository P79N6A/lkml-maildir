Hi,
	I've been surprised these last days to read ar wasn't that interesting
(!!!) so I did a slight bench :
http://fabian.unixtech.be/kernel/autoregulate/
Well, I hope we can have that pretty stuff in mainline.I'm bored
patching it again and again.
If some persons could confirm GUI is relaxed with autoregulation (well
its my case but I could use a box from Mars or smthg :) ).
Thanks,
FabF
