If DTRT means just using the existing code for large copies in general, 
that's easy enough...  patch attached.  I made the definition of "large 
copy" more pessimistic, where <= 128 bytes goes to __builtin_memcpy, 
otherwise to __constant_memcpy.  I carried this over to the MMX side too 
by proxy, as the existing MMX code already called __constant_memcpy. 
Thus, the modification is now only in one place.
If DTRT means not using MMX/SSE[2], that's a given considering the above 
code is from the "we don't have MMX/SSE" part of the ifdef.  If gcc 
starts using MMX with -march=i586 it's time for us all to go home and 
write a new compiler ;-)
Three tangents:
1) where did the 486 string ops go?
2) why no sse2-optimized memcpy?  just that noone has done one yet?
3) for copies >512 bytes, should we simply call the un-inlined memcpy? 
I would think that the call would get lost in cache misses of the block 
copy itself, but then again, __constant_memcpy (as it appears in output 
asm) is pretty darn small already.
