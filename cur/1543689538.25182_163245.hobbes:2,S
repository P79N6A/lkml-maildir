Ah, OK.  If you are confining the atom to a single syscall, then this is
a much easier problem to solve, assuming sys_reiser4() has a sufficiently
rich interface to express what people want to do.  It avoids all of the
potential problems that could arise if you want to keep a transaction
open over multiple syscalls.
