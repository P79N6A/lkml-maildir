The LTP output is here:
http://test.kernel.org/abat/33803/debug/test.log.1
The last test run was memset01
 From a good test run (
http://test.kernel.org/abat/33964/debug/test.log.1
)
the one after memset01 is a second instance of the same.
Which is bad I suppose, in that it's likely an intermittent failure.
Perhaps you can try running memset01 in a loop? I don't have such a
box set up here right now, I'm afraid ... will see what I can do.
OTOH, it looks like this might be a different failure than the double
fault we saw in previous -mm's, which was consistently in mtest01, IIRC.
