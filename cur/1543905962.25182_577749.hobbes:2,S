Its extremely hard as you've probably noticed by now.

The kernel IRQ handling is pretty flexible. A concious decision was made
many years ago not to try and limit it to do a pageable kernel as RAM was
far cheaper than the pain, and getting cheaper by the day.

Realistically - the one case it is done right now is by the mainframe
people, simply because the underlying hypervisor does it. You probably
have much more chance that way using a microkernel (real one not MACH)
underneath. Still a huge task.
