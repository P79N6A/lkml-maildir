Yes, you have them to move them too:
linux/spinlock.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
# define _spin_lock(l)                  rt_spin_lock(l)
# define _spin_lock_nested(l, s)        rt_spin_lock_nested(l, s)
# define _spin_lock_bh(l)               rt_spin_lock(l)
# define _spin_lock_irq(l)              rt_spin_lock(l)
# define _spin_unlock(l)                rt_spin_unlock(l)
# define _spin_unlock_no_resched(l)     rt_spin_unlock(l)
# define _spin_unlock_bh(l)             rt_spin_unlock(l)
# define _spin_unlock_irq(l)            rt_spin_unlock(l)
# define _spin_unlock_irqrestore(l, f)  rt_spin_unlock(l)
..
And below, both spin_lock and spin_lock_irqsave use PICK_OP to turn into
their _spin_lock_* equivalent, which are both mapped to rt_spin_lock in
-rt.
