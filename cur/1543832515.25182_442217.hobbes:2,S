Our bootloader doesn't access in-kernel functions, for obvious reasons. 
  The comment in cmdlinepart.c is unfortunately inaccurate.  The 
bootloader does need a mechanism for passing the partition table to the 
kernel, though.  Our partition table is generated on-the-fly by the 
bootloader to guarantee that each partition gets a certain number of 
non-bad NAND blocks.
We used to do this by passing the partition table in a string compatible 
with cmdlinepart syntax.  The kernel NAND driver then just passed the 
string received from the bootloader to mtdpart_setup().
Nowadays there is a better way of doing this, so as far as we are 
concerned, mtdpart_setup() can be made static again.  We'll migrate our 
MTD drivers to use the platform_data mechanism instead.
Cheers,
Juha
