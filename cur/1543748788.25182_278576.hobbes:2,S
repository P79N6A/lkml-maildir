Why by order of magnitude? Anyway on PC machines, cpu in low-power
mode takes about as much as rest of system, and in high-power mode it
takes more than rest of system combined.
I measured 1W savings from HZ=100, and that was on system that takes
17W total (arima athlon64 notebook). That is > 5%.

You assume that cpu goes to sleep immeidately. That is *very* far away
from reality on at least pentium 4. It takes half a milisecond to
sleep/wakeup the cpu, that basically means that low power mode is not
ever entered with HZ=1000...
