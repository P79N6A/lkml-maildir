Yes. This is a policy parser in kernel.
TOMOYO Linux' policy is passed from/to the kernel as a plain text
(i.e. ASCII printable) file via /proc/tomoyo interface.
For example, to add a permission to allow /usr/sbin/sshd
to execute /bin/bash if the authenticated user's uid = 500,
the administrator runs
# /bin/cat > /proc/tomoyo/domain_policy << EOF
select <kernel> /usr/sbin/sshd
1 /bin/bash if task.uid=500
EOF
and to remove this permission, the administrator runs
# /bin/cat > /proc/tomoyo/domain_policy << EOF
select <kernel> /usr/sbin/sshd
delete 1 /bin/bash if task.uid=500
EOF
The patch [TOMOYO 14/15] handles "if task.uid=500" part.
No compilation at userspace and
only difference between old and new policy is written.
This is similar to LDAP manipulation using LDIF format.
(To be exact, only programs that are registered in
/proc/tomoyo/manager can modify policy via /proc/tomoyo interface.
You need to use /usr/lib/ccs/loadpolicy or something
instead of /bin/cat .)
