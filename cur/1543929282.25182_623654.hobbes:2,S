Throwing in my 2c:
Kernel waiting 2 minutes on TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE is certainly broken.
I wouldn't wait that long for the system to become responsive, I yanked
the power cord already.
Hm, that's already detected with sleep_uninterruptible logic.
A task that's not killable for more than 2 minutes is broken still, but
less so.

Yes, that's exactly why the patch is needed - to find the bugs and fix
them. Otherwise you'll have problems finding some places to convert to
TASK_KILLABLE.
CIFS and similar have to be fixed - it tends to lock the app
using it, in unkillable state.

Throwing _rare_ stack traces is not breakage. 120s task_uninterruptible
in the usual case (no errors) is already broken - there are no sane
loads that can invoke that IMO.
A stack trace on x subsystem error is not that bad, especially as these 
are limited to 10 per session.
