Subject: Problem: Using 2.2.0preX Linux Reboots When Playing MP3s

When attempting to play an MP3 under 2.2.0 pre kernels (I have tried
pre7 and pre9) my Linux box reboots with no errors or warnings at all. I
have tried mpg123 and replay and they both reboot the box. It appears to
be okay if I play the mp3 and *nothing* else, but if I have a few
programs open the reboot will take place. I was previously using Kernel
2.0.34 and all was fine.
I am using mpg123 version 0.59o however as I said I also had the problem
using replay so I don't think it's program specific. I am now however
downloading various other mp3 players to see if I yeild the same
results.
/proc/version
        Linux version 2.2.0-final (root@hmm.nodge.cx) (gcc version
2.7.2.3)
A way to make the problem occur every time is to begin playing an mp3
using mpg123 under X and open a large program like Netscape at the same
time.
