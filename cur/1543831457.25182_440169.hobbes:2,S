This is not the situation in ATI, Conexant and UPK. They all 
manufacture chips, and they claim that the interface of the 
chip is their IP. I cannot accept this.
Let's take the Conexant case, I bought a computer (Thinkpad) 
with their modem. This means that I've paid for the hardware 
part.
Now this chip should be very primitive, it only allow the 
basic hardware support for software to produce the necessary 
waves.
They supply drivers for Windows for free, but they have sold 
the chip interface to 3rd party that sells!!! drivers for Linux.
They admit that they need no more money for the sale, but 
they don't publish the chip interface to allow others to 
develop appropriate software.
The secret should be on the software... But still they 
continue to limit the usage of the chip people payed money for.
And until now I did not discuss the low quality level of the 
linux binary drivers!
The same goes for ATI and others.
