Subject: [PATCH 0/9] tmpfs: towards unionfs and memcgroups

Neither unionfs nor memcgroups are working correctly with tmpfs and shmem.
If either or both are to go forward to 2.6.25, we shall need these patches
(against 2.6.24-rc5-mm1, but not dependent on unionfs or memcgroups) to go
in ahead.  A small set for unionfs and a smaller set for memcgroups follow.
