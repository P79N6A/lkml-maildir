Did you post any backtrace for those other boxes yet? It would be
especially useful if you could demonstrate the same random mm corruption
with different ram/motherboard/cpus (I mean all of them different), if
the devices are the same that's ok (since it could be a software bug in
a driver).
At the moment I doubt a bug in the common code since AFIK you are the
only one running into this sort of corruption and at the very least I
can't trigger it here (OTOH maybe it triggers with only one certain
application).
(just for clarity: with my previous posts I didn't mean it's not a
software bug, I only wanted to point out that with the current info we
cannot exclude completely an hardware issue yet)
