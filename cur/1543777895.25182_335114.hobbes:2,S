Hi,
I am not sure if I can ask this here but I could not find any other place 
where I could fine anyone with this knowledge.
I have a 15 GB file which I want to place in memory via tmpfs. I want to do 
this because I need to have this data accessible with a very low seek time.
I want to know if this is possible before spending 10,000 euros on a machine 
that has 16 GB of memory. 
The machine we plan to buy is a HP Proliant Xeon machine and I want to run a 
32 bit linux kernel on it (the xeon we want doesn't have the 64-bit stuff 
yet)
Thanks in advance,
Bastiaan
