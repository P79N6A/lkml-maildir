From the first mail:
hda: max request size: 128KiB
hda: 40021632 sectors (20491 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=39704/16/63
hda: cache flushes not supported
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda4
It seems that DMA is not used by default (CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=n),
so this is probably exactly the same issue.
Please try the patch attached to the bugzilla bug entry.
Thanks,
Bart
