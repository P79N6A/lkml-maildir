I have no problem with clients giving some credit to X,
I am more concerned with X giving half of its credit to
a single client, a quarter of its credit to another client, etc...
For example, a client could setup a periodical wake up
from X, and then periodically getting some credit for free.
Would that be possible?
Thanks.
