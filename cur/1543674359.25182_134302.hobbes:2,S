No, not acceptable.
The thing is, trying to redefine the old namespaces is hopeless at this 
point.  Hence the proposed new namespace <linux/abi/*.h> ... 
<linux/abi/arch/*.h> would be my preference for an arch-specific 
subnamespace.
Thus the rule is:
a) <linux/abi/*> files MUST NOT include files outside <linux/abi/*>
b) <linux/*.h> and <asm/*.h> are legacy namespaces.  They should be 
considered to be completely different in kernel and userspace -- in 
effect, glibc will eventually ship with its own set of these headers.
c) <linux/abi/*> files should be clean for inclusion from either kernel 
or userspace.
