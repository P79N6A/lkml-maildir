...and in case the hardware does *not* have such mixer settings, the
right place to introduce them is probably 'esd' or equivalent.  I don't
remember if mpg123 (or its 21st-century equivalent, ogg123) support esd
but I think they do, and if not they should be hacked to.

I've just got to ask: what exactly do you feel you need for which
Debian 'unstable' is not up-to-date?  (Check 
http://packages.debian.org
to see what versions of things are available in 'unstable'.)  I ask
because in my experience, they have very rarely been more than a few
weeks out of date on any major software, except where a significant
architecture change was involved (such as the migration to xfree86
4.x), or a feature not deemed "ready for prime time" (BIND 9.0)..

Well, that's understandable - don't compile in support for features you
know you won't need, etc, save maybe 10% of your disk space that way..
