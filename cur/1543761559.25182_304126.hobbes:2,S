Heh. Let me describe "real life" a bit more accurately.
We've been running with pci error detection enabled here for the last
two years.  Based on this experience, the ballpark figures are:
90% of all detected errors were device driver bugs coupled to 
    pci card hardware errata
9% poorly seated pci cards (remove/reseat will make problem go away)
1% transient/other.
We've seen *EVERY* and I mean *EVERY* device driver that we've put
under stress tests (e.g. peak i/o rates for > 72 hours, e.g. 
massive tcp/nfs traffic, massive disk i/o traffic, etc), *EVERY*
driver tripped on an EEH error detect that was traced back to 
a device driver bug.  Not to blame the drivers, a lot of these
were related to pci card hardware/foirmware bugs.  For example, 
I think grepping for "split completion" and "NAPI" in the 
patches/errata for e100 and e1000 for the last year will reveal 
some of the stuff that was found.  As far as I know,
for every bug found, a patch made it into mainline.
As a rule, it seems that finding these device driver bugs was
very hard; we had some people work on these for months, and in 
the case of the e1000, we managed to get Intel engineers to fly
out here and stare at PCI bus traces for a few days.  (Thanks Intel!)
Ditto for Emulex.  For ipr, we had inhouse people.
So overall, PCI error detection did have the expected effect 
(protecting the kernel from corruption, e.g. due to DMA's going 
to wild addresses), but I don't think anybody expected that the
vast majority would be software/hardware bugs, instead of transient 
effects.
What's ironic in all of this is that by adding error recovery,
device driver bugs will be able to hide more effectively ... 
if there's a pci bus error due to a driver bug, the pci card
will get rebooted, the kernel will burp for 3 seconds, and 
things will keep going, and most sysadmins won't notice or 
won't care.
