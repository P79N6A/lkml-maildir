    That application is probably using the device directory for the
    machine it's on, and if it does want to use the device directory
    for the server, sensible programming practice would seem to dictate
    being able to track changes to the devices, because servers will
    go down and have the hardware changed out from under you.

    Do applications on other machines care what the devices on the server
    are?
