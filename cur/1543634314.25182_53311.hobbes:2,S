It's certainly easier at the tail, but with htree we may have
genuinely enormous directories and being able to hole-punch arbitrary
coalesced blocks could be a huge win.  Also, doing the coalescing
block by block is likely to be far easier for ext3 than truncating
the directory arbitrarily back in one go.  
Chopping a large directory at once brings back the truncate()
nightmare of having to make an unbounded disk operation seem atomic,
even if it has to get split over multiple transactions.  Incremental
coalescing should allow us to know in advance how many disk blocks we
might end up touching for the operation, so we can guarantee to do it
in one transaction.
Cheers,
 Stephen
