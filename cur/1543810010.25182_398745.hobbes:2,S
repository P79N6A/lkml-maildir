I'm confused.  Weren't you arguing, only a few days ago, that it _should_
be okay to unplug a USB drive while the system is suspended?  After all,
since there's no difference (as far as the kernel can see) between power
loss on the bus and an actual unplug, you can hardly say that one should
be allowed and the other not.
