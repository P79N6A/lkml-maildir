Hi, Alan.
    Have you been modify the part of pdc202xx.c we mention last time?
And I have another issue to ask you modify. Could you please modify
pdc202xx.c to append "QUANTUM FIREBALLP KA9.1" for mark quirk
drives.
const char *pdc_quirk_drives[] = {
 "QUANTUM FIREBALLlct08 08",
 "QUANTUM FIREBALLP KA6.4",
 "QUANTUM FIREBALLP KA9.1",     //please append this line
 "QUANTUM FIREBALLP LM20.4",
 "QUANTUM FIREBALLP KX20.5",
 "QUANTUM FIREBALLP KX27.3",
 "QUANTUM FIREBALLP LM20.5",
 NULL
};
If any other questions about Promise products,
Please feel free to mail support@promise.com or support@promise.com.tw
Don't reply me directly.
Thanks and Regards
Hank Yang
