Jörn,
   I did a little work on this file system choice a couple of weeks ago. My
results said stay away from ext3. I'm now using reiserfs.
   There is a directory with some results on the same drive (different
partitions) using ext2, ext3 and reiserfs. ext3 and reiserfs also have data
on how ext2 performed on that partition, but it didn't matter. Each
partition was mostly the same.

   FYI - I had to drop Gnome as it had too many things going on in the
background. These results were done using fluxbox.
Mark

oh, i should have stated i'm using reiserfs on /, /usr and /var (var
being a softraid-0).
