Chipset?
Is the second CPU installed or not?
If the second CPU is installed, has it been disabled in BIOS?
Relevant config? What combinations of UP_APIC and UP_IOAPIC have
you been using? Has ACPI been enabled or not?
A plain kernel with UP_APIC but no SMP or UP_IOAPIC shouldn't
provoke the kinds of APIC errors you mentioned, unless the APIC
bus is noisy due to a missing second CPU (just a theory).

Ingo Molnar, Maciej W. Rozycki, and myself.

Intel's IA32 manual set, Volume 3, is required reading.
