Grargh.  At work all weekend.  Didn't have time to make a real patch.
Anyhow - Proposed changes to airo.c for rfmonitor mode.  I've been working
on making it quiet (not continually probing) and on making it enter "true"
rfmon mode (right now it doesn't, which is why user-controlled channel
hopping doesn't work).  Both of these are "special case" stuff that doesn't
affect normal users, but are near and dear to my own pursuits. :P
I've succeeded in the first, but not the second, so I hadn't released any
changed driver code.  The first is actually a very simple change - in the 
code block that puts the driver into rfmon mode (around line 2480 on my 
code) after setting:
config.rmode = RXMODE_RFMON | RXMODE_DISABLE_802_3_HEADER;
or 
config.rmode = RXMODE_RFMON_ANYBSS | RXMODE_DISABLE_802_3_HEADER;
it should set:
config.scanMode = SCANMODE_PASSIVE;
and in the code block exiting rfmon mode, after:
config.opmode = 0;
it should set:
config.scanMode = SCANMODE_ACTIVE;
With my testing this stops the probing in rfmon (good) and doesn't have any
negative impacts.  More testing is, of course, a good idea.
I can try to come up with an exact diff but I figured I should get something
out while everyone is discussing changes, and I don't know how much time I'm
going to have in the coming weeks.
