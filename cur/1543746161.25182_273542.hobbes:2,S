Yes, that was what I was thinking we'd have to resort to. Not a bad idea.
It would be nice if you could have it integrated with the locking that
is already there - for example mmap_sem, although that might mean you'd
have to take mmap_sem for writing which may limit scalability of thread
creation / destruction... maybe a seperate lock / semaphore for that list
itself would be OK.
Deferred rss might be a practical solution, but I'd prefer this if it can
be made workable.
