| Why is your kernel tainted?
| 
| Are you using stock 2.4.22-rc2 or do you have any additional 
| patches/modules running? 
Stock 2.4.22-rc2 with alsa, and I'm using a binary only
module for my webcam from 
http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/
BUT, I'm getting the oopses *without* the module loaded in.
Its loaded at startup, thats why tainted later.
I can reproduce the oops all the time, with or without the module.
