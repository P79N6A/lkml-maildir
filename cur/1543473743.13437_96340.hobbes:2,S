Okay, I think the problem here is that LinuxPPC, Inc., and LinuxPPC org are
getting confused with each other. The transition from LPPC.org to LPPC.com has
been hazy at best. LPPC.org should list different distributions in a similar
way to Linux.org. If you've ever been there it lists, among others,
LinuxPPC.org as a link/distribution.
LinuxPPC, Inc., (or .com) is a distribution, with R5 in beta from LPPC, Inc.,
and it would seem that it heavily favors PowerMac owners (and thus, BootX
would be its official method of booting), since the largest number of PPC
platform owners are PowerMac users, or at least have PowerMacs on which they
run LinuxPPC. There are other distributions, but on the .org site they are not
given much attention (which naturally means that Quik and/or OF would be
pushed to the side as time goes on).
I think that this list also heavily favors LPPC, Inc., because at the moment
it is the largest distribution, and really, the best supported. So when you
see that R5 is going to support only BootX, remember that it is only this
particular distribution that will do that. Certainly you are free to create
your own distribution based on others' work, with whatever modifications you
think are desirable. Or if you can get a number of people to work on that
project, more power to you and your distribution.
As for me, I will soon be back to hacking my way through OF, figuring it all
out, and letting the world know what I discover, and hopefully making a useful
contribution to the LinuxPPC.org movement.
