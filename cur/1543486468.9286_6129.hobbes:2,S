NFS has nothing do with it.  Right now, you can mount over any
directory you want!
The comment for do_mount in fs/super.c says:
 * [21-Mar-97] T.Schoebel-Theuer: Now this can be overridden when
 * supplying a leading "!" before the dir_name, allowing "stacks" of
 * mounted filesystems. The stacking will only influence any pathname lookups
 * _after_ the mount, but open file descriptors or working directories that
 * are now covered remain valid. For example, when you overmount /home, any
 * process with old cwd /home/joe will continue to use the old versions,
 * as long as relative paths are used, but absolute paths like /home/joe/xxx
 * will go to the new "top of stack" version. In general, crossing a
 * mount point will always go to the top of stack element.
 * Anyone using this new feature must know what he/she is doing.
I can't see any check for a `!' anywhere in the code; perhaps this
`feature' is now default behaviour?

Nothing is ever a complete failure; it can always serve as a bad example.
