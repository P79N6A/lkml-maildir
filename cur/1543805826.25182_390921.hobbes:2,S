Oh yeah there is. Each dynamic per-cpu object would have been  atleast
(NR_CPUS * sizeof (void *) + num_cpus_possible * cacheline_size ).  
Now kmalloc_node will fall back on size-32 for allocation of long, so
replace the cacheline_size above with 32 -- which then means dynamic per-cpu
data are not on a cacheline boundary anymore (most modern cpus have 64byte/128 
byte cache lines) which means per-cpu data could end up false shared....
