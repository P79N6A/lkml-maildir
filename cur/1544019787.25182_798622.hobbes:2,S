I must say that this commit looks very much like a combination of
my commits from November:
[ARM] omap: move clock propagation into core omap clock code
[ARM] omap: remove unnecessary calls to propagate_rate()
[ARM] omap: move propagate_rate() calls into generic omap clock code
which do basically the same thing a little more efficiently, and an
additional patch from you to call ->recalc after set_rate or
reparenting a clock.
So I think I can drop everything from this apart from the additional
recalc calls, and the removal of those omap2_dpllcore_recalc() calls.
Please confirm my suspicions.
