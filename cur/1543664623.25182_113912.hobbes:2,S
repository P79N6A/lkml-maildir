Hi,
yes I agree that the code will be slightly less efficient in this case
(though looking a bit around, there are way more places which could be
optimized, e.g. the useless "&& !acm->throttle" in the next line). 
What's IMHO more important is that the original code was producing the
correct result, so the patch for acm.c is not really necessary.  This is
also true for the patches for gus_midi.c, gus-wave.c, and i2c-proc.c.
OTOH, I still think that in most (all?) of this cases the bit-op was not
intended.
Anyway, I'll wait another day or two to collect replies from the
maintainers and then resend the remaining patches where the code really
produces wrong results.
so long
	Norbert
