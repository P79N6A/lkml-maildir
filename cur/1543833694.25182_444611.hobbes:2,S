Sure, if the admin has allowed it, but I think it's also OK for desktop
users to have access to rt scheduling by default, as long as their tasks
are "well-behaved" (i.e. only use a few percent CPU).

The problem is not the fact that it's enabled, but the fact that the
amount of CPU allowed isn't restricted.
