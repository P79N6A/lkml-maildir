Hi,
I observer that when the linux IP, fragments the packet, it sends the first
fragment packet (containing the Transport layer information) at the last. In
short if the packets arrive in the transmitted order at the destination the
last fragment is received first and the first fragment at the last.
Why is it so?
Thanks and regards
Ajay
