One thing at a time.  What if there is a zone "ceiling" that we keep
lowered exactly until it is time for the process that does the send_msg
to run, when we raise the ceiling.  (I don't know how this VM stuff
works in detail inside - this is an invitation to list the objections).
The scheduler could presumably be trained to muck with the ceilings
according to flags on the process (task?) structs.
