If glibc is looking at kernel.osrelease it might make sense.
If glibc is looking at kernel.version which is just the build number
and date I can't imagine a correct usage.
If this usage is still common in glibc we can decide what to do
when the warnings pop up.

Yes.  Andrew and I discussed that and when he picked up a patch.
A printk was added to warn of people using the interface.
