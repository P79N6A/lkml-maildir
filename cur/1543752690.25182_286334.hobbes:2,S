The users are still vulnerable during the time you are preparing your 
kernel packages.
Personally I'd very much prefer to know of the bug even before a fix is 
ready since that would allow me to protect my systems in alternative ways 
until the fixes are ready.   Depending on the nature of the bug I 
could perhaps tweak firewall rulesets temporarily, temporarily disable 
certain services, perhaps I could mount a few filesystems read-only for a 
few days, maybe rebuild my current vulnerable kernel with an option 
disabled as a workaround and live with less functionality until the fix is 
ready, maybe even take vulnerable systems offline until a fix is ready. 
Having the info that the bug exists and can be targeted in this or 
that way gives me a chance to respond and protect my systems while a 
proper fix is being developed.  I can't do that if I'm in the dark until 
vendors feel comfortable and ready to release packaged bug free kernels - 
and all the time I'm waiting some black hat idiot may have found the same 
bug and cracked my system.
