	Personally, I've never managed to make irport work, and I know
that in 2.5.X it's worse.
	But, the message above indicate that you fed the driver with
improper module options. Try to set the proper irq, that would help.
	Also, Daniele did lot's of work on the new SMC driver (smsc2,
available on my web page). Maybe you could test this one.
