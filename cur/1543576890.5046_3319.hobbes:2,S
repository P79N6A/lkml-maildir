That sounds like too long a stall to be due to elevator ordering except
with some _really_ unlucky access patterns (or with slow disks). 
There are other, equally likely, candidates for these kinds of stalls:
 - filesystem locks. Especially the ext2 superblock lock. You can easily
   hit this one, as some ext2 functions actually do a lot of IO while
   holding the lock.
 - synchronously waiting for bdflush with balance_dirty_buffers().
   Especially mixed with the above.
A mixture of the two above will bascally stall the whole machine: almost
any non-cached file access ends up waiting for the superblock lock and
bdflush, and it can easily get quite unfair.
