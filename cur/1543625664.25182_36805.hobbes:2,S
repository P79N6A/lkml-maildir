With the 'everything is module' and 'everything is hotplug' approach in
mind (which is a appealing way and IMHO this is the way we are going),
I see two part for this problem:
. Persistence after plug out/plug in 
. Persistence after suspend/resume
The first one is a userland problem. The card identification could be
based on the MAC address (for NICs at least, in the case of cardbus the
bus position has no real signification). This should then be the
responsibility of the userspace tool (hotplug) to indicate the correct
option for this card. The problem is when the module is already loaded,
the userspace tool has no way to indicate this option.
The second problem is a kernel problem. It seems not so difficult (as
soon as we have a way to identify each card, which is the case for
NICs) to keep in memory the options for further use.
We don't even need a hash here. We can keep in a fifo table the options
for each removed card and then when a card is inserted lookup with the
MAC address.
Clearly the vector of values for an option to control separately each
card is no more adapted to the today hardware.
As I see it what is missing is a way for hotplug to give some directives
(enable wol for this card) back to the kernel. Today this is possible
(done) for the first card for a given driver (via the module options).
