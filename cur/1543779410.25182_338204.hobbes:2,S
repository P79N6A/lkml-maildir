http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=200803dfe4ff772740d63db725ab2f1b185ccf92;hp=21fe3471c3aaa5c489c5d3a4d705291eb7511248
here is the current status with kernel 2.6.13rc4-git4 and kernel 
parameters "pci=routeirq apic=debug acpi=debug irqpoll".
It's working better - there is only one "nobody cared" message and only 
a few lines "drive appears confused" for hdb and hde in syslog. Both of 
them are cdrom drives. I also have hda and hdh, what are harddisk drives 
and where the error does not occur. Perhaps this could help you?
A small test copying files from hda/hdh to /tmp is working - so this 
problem seems to be fixed. Moreover I did not recognize the error...
---------------
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x64
hda: DMA interrupt recovery
hda: lost interrupt
---------------
...anymore.
Copying files from cdrom hdb to /tmp I get continually following errors 
in syslog:
---------------
hdb: media error (bad sector): status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: media error (bad sector): error=0x30 { LastFailedSense=0x03 }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
end_request: I/O error, dev hdb, sector 1306960
Buffer I/O error on device hdb, logical block 326740
---------------
I get the same errors when I try to copy files from my dvdrom hde to 
/tmp. There is still something broken.
Regards,
Alexander
