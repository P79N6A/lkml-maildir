ESTALE should occur whenever the client looses connection to the server,
or thinks it has lost connection. It isn't directly related to the server
other than the fact that a server reboot will also cause it to happen.
This should be a transient failure that recovers when communication verified
from some of the timeouts/retries associated with NFS.
At worst, it can require a remount of the NFS volumn.
