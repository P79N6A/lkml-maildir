The word graph is actually here to explain here that we not only trace
each function call
but we can actually retrieve all of the call path of a function and
then draw it as if it was

Yeah, I will do some tests to see if I can have a relevant result....

ditto, I will try to do something to early_printk() a trace instead of
inserting into the ring buffer.
That could be a trace_option as an example.
