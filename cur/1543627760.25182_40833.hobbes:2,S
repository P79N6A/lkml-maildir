   Alpha processors don't have full division hardware, they have to
   iterate it one bit at the time. They do have a flash multiplier,
   and a barrel-shifter.  Shifts take one pipeline cycle, like to
   addition and substraction.  Multiply takes 6-12 depending on model,
   but division takes 64...
   Converting the  tick  to  gettimeofday()  seconds is faster when
   the tick is power of two.
