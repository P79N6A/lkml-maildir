Yes. However, the discussion is now over due to the .1 work which solves 
a different problem than was intended, which was getting more people to 
test kernels before they become 2.6.N final. It's going to take another 
few months again now for people to notice that, but oh well. Personally, 
I don't have a problem anyway. I think 2.6 is great ...
