Maybe we should just swap computers or something?
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 145 user: 180 system: 18
Finished mem_load: elapsed: 146 user: 0 system: 2 loads: 5000
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 135 user: 181 system: 17
Finished mem_load: elapsed: 136 user: 0 system: 2 loads: 4800

256MB, dual CPU, ext3/IDE.
Whereas 2.5.63+bk gives:
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 131 user: 182 system: 17
Finished mem_load: elapsed: 131 user: 0 system: 1 loads: 4900
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 135 user: 182 system: 17
Finished mem_load: elapsed: 135 user: 0 system: 1 loads: 4800
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 129 user: 182 system: 17
Finished mem_load: elapsed: 129 user: 0 system: 1 loads: 4600
Conceivably swap fragmentation, but unlikely.  Is it still doing a swapoff
between runs?
