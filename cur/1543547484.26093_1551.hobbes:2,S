Gentlemen,
After reading every f'ing bit of documentation I can find, I'm left with
several unanswered questions regarding the AGP patches:
- In the absence of any applications which actually do 3D rendering, is
  there any performance advantage to loading the agpgart module?
- Assuming an answer in the affirmative, what incantations are necessary
  in order for the XF86_SVGA server to take advantage of them?  Is it
  sufficient to simply have the module loaded prior to X startup?  Can the
  module be loaded _after_ X startup?
Absolutely _all_ the documentation I can find is focussed on its use with
GLX, etc.  I'm just looking to get faster tru-color X display from my
NVidia RIVA (Diamond V550 16-MB).  And, since I'm considering the purchase
of a Matrox G400, what about that bit of hardware?
Any input or pointers appreciated.
Steve
