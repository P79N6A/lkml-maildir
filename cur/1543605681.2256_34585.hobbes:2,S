Don't worry, there are more than enough kernel hackers
outside of the US to keep maintaining the kernel.
The worst that could happen is that the US cripples
itself by not allowing the kernel hackers outside the
US to publish security info to people in the US, but
only to the rest of the world.
That's tough, they're a democratic country, they can
change the law if it hurts them too much.
cheers,
Rik
