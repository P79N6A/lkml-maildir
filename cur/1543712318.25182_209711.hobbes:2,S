This code which is in the existing driver to prevent pathological lock
contention on large SMP:
        /* if over the trickle threshold, use only 1 in 4096 samples
	*/
        if ( input_pool.entropy_count > trickle_thresh &&
             (__get_cpu_var(trickle_count)++ & 0xfff))
                return;
