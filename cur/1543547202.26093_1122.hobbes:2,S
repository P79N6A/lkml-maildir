Hi All,
I am testing my scsi driver. I started the test, and down
the line, the I/O processes (cp/rm) are hung. It looks
like they are hung on completion of some I/O. How do I 
find out, for which I/O they are waiting ? Is there any
way to look at the kernel data structures ?
Thanks and regards,
-hiren
