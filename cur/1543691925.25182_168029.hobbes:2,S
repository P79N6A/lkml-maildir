hi,
please point me to a FAQ if this is solved...
I run 2.4.20 (still) and had a strange problem. as of a uptime of 72 days my
PC got strange. the memory was completely full (as shown by free, top,...)
even if no user procs ran. i restarted X but probably these leaks have to do
something with xine (Xv, Framebuffer?).
additional to this memleak there was a strange audio problem with my via82xx
ALSA driver: the more the mem leak grew the worse the sound output got. high
frequencies where cut out, low frequencies just were not sampled in a good way
-- it just got bad. 
after rebooting everything got ok. 
now, i have seen many memleaks, even in the kernel, but never did i see such
a sound problem? any hints?
kind regards,
paul.
