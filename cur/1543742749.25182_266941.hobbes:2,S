Ok, I just retested with 2.6.8.1 and lvm2 on 2 sd disks, I no longer get oops  when
the snapshot fills up. (However I cant control a policy what should happen
on snapshot fillup. Currently it looks like dm-snap is always invalidating
the snapshot LV. Other option would be to block IO (on the original drive)
or return ENOSPC. I can think of situations where this is desired.
My inital problems howwever have been with lvm1 meta data volumnes and 2.4,
cant test those anymore.
