I assume that the system in question isn't:
1. Isn't setting up the drive in BIOS for DMA operation?
2. Isn't showring the hda: hda1.... partition layout?
As one can see from the above the problem is caused by PIO
read getting worser. I know the problem and am working on it.
As a band plase apply patch -p1 -R < ide-clean-92.diff.
I hope I can provide the proper solution soon.
