IWSTM that the way you would justify this being a system call would also
suggest working with non-linux kernel developers (both open source as well
as commercial) to determine a mutually agreed syntax/semantic for this
call to further ensure the basis of the universality that ensure it will
be one of those "forever" facilities, and maybe even make it into a future
standard.
You opened the camel's mouth; do you want to check the teeth?
