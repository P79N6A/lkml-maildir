This suggestion comes up about once a year, and I have some code that
implements such as "swap daemon".  I must admit it is nearly two years
since the last mention.
Have a look for "swapd" available from
    
http://www.alfie.demon.co.uk/download/
The original code was written in 1993, and released in 1994 (on the
next discussion).  Minor tweaks have happened, but nothing major.
I have never used it.  A few have.
If this really were the right approach, it would have become more widely
adopted, with a little more kernel support.
