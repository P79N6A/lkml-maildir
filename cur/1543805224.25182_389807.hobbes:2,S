Yes, this is the same laptop.
Turns out this was a bug in the USB EHCI bios handoff logic, a newer
patch from David fixed it.  The APIC stuff was just a false alarm, and
for now, I've just turned it off, thanks to Pete reminding me about it.
When I get this laptop converted to 64bit, I'll try out your patches.
