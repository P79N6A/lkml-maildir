the problem with Shift-PgUP is that all the framebuffer drivers I tried
(matrox, ati, vesa) corrupt the screen when it is used. The only way to
use Shift-PgUp reliably I have ever seen was on vgacon. These bugs seemed
to be there for years so I didn't even bother reporting them - I just got
used to the idea "using fb? forget the Shift-PgUP then".
