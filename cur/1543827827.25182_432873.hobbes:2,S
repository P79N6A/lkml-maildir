I don't know since I cannot deactivate encryption on my AP - I must use
encryption.
I just tested the following Card-Bus-Card:
02:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One
54g] 802.11g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02)
It's also a broadcom-chip in another version, but the driver also says:
ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Invalid argument
Driver did not support SIOCSIWENCODEEXT
WPA: Failed to set PTK to the driver.
The driver really seems to have a problem: wpa_supplicant wants to do
something and the driver does not understands it.
