Hi,
  I have found a problem with the use of apm on my
dell inspiron 8100 running kernel 2.4.18-10.  Any
access to the apm kernel routine (for example cat
/proc/apm) causes the system clock to run slow.  About
1% slow if I run the battstat applet in gnome.  I
suspect that somehow the clock interrupt is getting
missed during the apm bios/kernel call.  Looking
though the apm.c I don't see how to fix this.  I tried
the switch apm=allow_int, but that showed no change. 
I have found some vague (don't mention apm) references
to this problem on the web, but no solutions.  Does
anyone understand this problem?
Thanks,
Mike
