But not all modifying operations must descend into the tree from the
root.  Not even operations that modify the tree itself, let alone
operations that modify the individual devices without changing their
position in the tree.

Pinning isn't the issue; serialization is.  You can't serialize 
operations on device Y by locking device X, even if X is at the root of 
a sub-tree containing Y.

I didn't say anything about unbounded recursion.  I said there would be 
one level of recursion, and that alone would mess up the lockdep scheme 
in your proposed patch.

No.  You're advocating spending a lot of effort to take something that
works well and for no good reason make it much more complicated and
prone to failure.

I want to lock all the children.  It can't be done just by locking the 
root of the sub-tree.

Nonsense.  Consider a simple tree: A is the root, B and C are two
children of A.  Task 1 wants to lock all the entries in the tree, so it
acquires the locks for A (the parent), then B, and then C (the
children).  Meanwhile task 2 also wants to lock all the entries in the
tree, so it acquires the locks for A (the parent), then C, and then B
(the children).  Now there _is_ a lateral dependency (BC/CB), despite
the fact that both tasks lock from the top down.

I wasn't aware of the limit.  This definitely suggests that I will need
to use lockdep-avoiding routines at some stage, even if not for the
purpose being discussed here.

Yes, the grandparent really needs serialization.  We guarantee, for 
example, that suspend and resume methods won't get called while probe 
is running.  That guarantee is provided by the device sem.  If you 
change it into a mutex and release it inside a subroutine called from 
probe then the guarantee won't be met.

No.  You seem to think that top-down is a clear-cut, well-defined total
order.  It isn't; it's only a partial order.  In the example I gave
earlier, top-down doesn't establish any definite order relation between
B and C because they are siblings.  But there might be a power
dependency between them.

That would work.  But it shows that the situation is more complicated 
than it seems at first.

It would work, but what an awful waste of time!  Not to mention the 
overhead due to cache-line bouncing on SMP systems.  And contention for 
hotspots near the root of the device tree.
All just to make lockdep happy!  It doesn't seem worth it, to me.
