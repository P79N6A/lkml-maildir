   No. I set all sockets, even the original listen() socket to
   TCP_NODELAY.
How about setting it on the resulting socket, not just the
listen one?  Ie. at both ends always set TCP_NODELAY to 1
on each new socket created.
Nagle (Ie. TCP_NODELAY) is the only thing which could explain
the behavior you are complaining about.
