This is why Microsoft introduced a certification program for drivers
compatible with Win2000. You'll get a warning saying that the driver is
not certified, and could break the kernel. Most drivers still (seem to)
work, which is why everyone I know does use the (maybe) outdated
drivers. But this indicates that Microsoft has the same problem of
"correct" drivers, and forces driver writers to update their code this
way.
I think this also loops back to the release timing issue: if you have
lotsa changes in one release, big chance that there are a number (> 1)
of changes that will affect a driver. I think it's easier for driver
writers to cope with one or two changes at a time. When a change doesn't
get in in the next release because it is not yet stable enough, it
probably will get in into the next release. This also gives some
perspective on what things will change in which (near-future) release.
But then again, this definitely requires some communication, which as
Alan pointed out, isn't always done..
Erik.
