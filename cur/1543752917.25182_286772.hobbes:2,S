Rather "Its also about price levels and the sum of costs to all parties 
involved."
For example if you share the costs of 5000 lines of code with millions 
of people
you can afford to pay the costs of developing them in a way which 
really assures safety.
Think about the software controlling a servo motor in your car...
You can't neglect economics when thinking about security issues, because
costs are the "metric" of this "space". If you don't like dollars just 
think about an even more
precise currency you have to pay with anyway: developer time.
Its simply expensive to develop well working code. And on the other 
hand buggy code is not bad in itself. Its just that cheap...
