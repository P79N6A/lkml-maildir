Any reference that Marx ever 'thought' something like this?
I know it's getting terrible offtopic, but this is such common
misconception. Marx delivered in first place an excellent analysis of the
capitalistic economy, which is still very much valid today. If you want to
know why current economy is going downhill, you'll will more likely find
answers there than from any of the "experts" today.
Anything else is mostly interpreted into Marx, you will hardly find any
predictions about what would come after the capitalism.
bye, Roman
