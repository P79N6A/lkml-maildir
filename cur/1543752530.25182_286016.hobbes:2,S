this only works if you have no reason to mix the non-exec and R/O stuff in 
the same directory (there is some software that has paths for stuff hard 
coded that will not work without them being togeather)
also it gives you no ability to maintain the protection for normal users 
at the same time that an admin updates the system. Linus's proposal would 
let you five this cap to the normal users, but still let the admin manage 
the box normally.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
