I am not sure what you are doing, and I don't remeber seing your
script to reproduce the problem, but I can confirm you that:
- loop device works
- initrd works
We used it for Mandrake kernels, and it works with SCSI without any
problems.  Could you send me your script to create the intrd to me to
take a look?
Later, Juan.
