The kernel has one gigabyte to map on x86. In your case 256M is used for
RAM and the most of the rest can go to vmalloc. VmallocTotal merely
indicates the amount of virtual memory that can be used for vmalloc'ed
(non-contigous) mappings. There's not much more fun to do with the
remaining kernel virtual memory so...
There's really not much to it.
