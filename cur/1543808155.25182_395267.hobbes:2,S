Why is it not acceptable? The pkt_start_write() function is only
called from the kcdrwd() kernel thread and the pkt_start_write()
function doesn't call anything else in the kernel that could require
lots of stack space.
The actual I/O is started from pkt_iosched_process_queue(), which
calls generic_make_request(). However pkt_iosched_process_queue() is
on a different call chain than pkt_start_write(), so I don't see how
this could be a problem.
