Kernel code does not get pre-empted by signals. If the code needs to be 
interruptible by signals this has to be handled explicitly. 
interruptible_sleep on will stop waiting if your task gets a signal, but 
your code doesn't check the signal_pending flag to know whether it 
should exit the loop. If signal_pending(current) is set after the sleep 
you should likely be returning -ERESTARTSYS to allow the task to handle 
the signal. Then after the signal handler from the task returns, the 
ioctl will get called again.
Also, as was pointed out, you should not use the sleep_on family of 
functions, use the wait_event functions intead. sleep_on is racy, if the 
interrupt happened just before you do the sleep, you'll sit there 
waiting for something that already occurred.
