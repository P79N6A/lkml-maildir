if you have 18 million KiB and each file is a single block (512 Bytes = 0.5 Kib) 
then assuming zero overhead you could fit 18 Million KiB / 0.5 KiB = 36 Million 
files on the drive.
thus being scheptical about 40 million files on a 18G drive.
this is only possible if you are abel to have multiple files per 512 byte block.
