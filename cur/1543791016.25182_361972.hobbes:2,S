Not sure why?  Let me see if some new values could better articulate the
meaning.  Currently if value is < 0 then don't check the watermarks.
When we do check for watermarks, then the value of 1 indicates that it
could go below minimum value.

I will remove the inline based on your and Nick emails.  Though my patch
had inline before the struct....
-static struct page *
-buffered_rmqueue(struct zone *zone, int order, gfp_t gfp_flags)
+static inline struct page *
+buffered_rmqueue(struct zone *zone, int order, gfp_t gfp_flags, int
replenish)
...so that shouldn't have caused any problem.

Will be fixed.

A bit futuristic.  Will need it when pcp allocations gets checked first
(as Nick also mentioned).  Will remove it for now.

The last line is from zone_watermark_ok.  The first check is in
get_page_from_freelist.  There is no (can_try_harder) check for this
flag in that function.
