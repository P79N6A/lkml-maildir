ok, thanks for testing it!

under what load is that - 10 loops? There's no disk or network IO going 
on during a WM menu appearance, correct?
This could be a time-slicing difference perhaps - if you have 
CONFIG_HZ=100 could you change it to 1000 (or if you have it at 1000, 
could you change it to 100) - does it show any sensitivity to that?
the other difference could be SCHED_FEAT_START_DEBIT, does that WM menu 
latency go down if you clear it from sched_features, i.e. to subtract 16 
from sched_features:
  echo 15 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_features
to restore the default, do:
  echo 31 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_features
(if you have CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y). You might also want to try changing 
/proc/sys/kernel/sched_granularity_ns. Boundary conditions: make sure 
that if you change the sched_granularity value you also set 
/proc/sys/kernel/sched_runtime_limit_ns to 2*sched_granularity and set 
/proc/sys/kernel/sched_wakeup_granularity_ns to sched_granularity/2. 
Other interesting bits to experiment with in sched_features would be 
SCHED_FEAT_FAIR_SLEEPERS (mask '1' in the bitmask) and 
SCHED_FEAT_SKIP_INITIAL (mask '32' in the bitmask).
