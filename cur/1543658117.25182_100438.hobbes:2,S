I'm aware of this, but you were complaining of a new device
which you got, so I assumed the INQUIRY response data came
from the device, in your particular situation.

I agree with this.

I'm aware of this list.

Yes, I did understand all this from your first email -- the practicallity
of the matter. This is good.
I was just speaking out of principle, to present the other side.
Sometimes it's better to present a fix out of principle rather than
a particuliarity, this abstractizes further up and provides a long
lasting solution.
But yes, this is a pickle of a problem.
