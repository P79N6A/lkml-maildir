"This is hard, lets make it someone else's problem" shouldn't ever be the
answer, especially if the end result is that we become even more
dependant on bits of userspace running before the system becomes useful.

See the 'libtune' crack that people have been trying to get distros to
adopt for a long time.
If we need some form of adaptive behaviour, the kernel needs to be
doing this monitoring/adapting, not some userspace daemon that may
not get scheduled before its too late.
If the kernel can't get the defaults right, what makes you think
userspace can do better ?    Just as the kernel can't get
"one size fits all" right, there's no silver bullet just by clicking
"this is a database server" button to have it configure random
sysctls etc.  These things require thought and planning that
daemons will never get right in every case.  And when they get
it wrong, the results can be worse than the stock defaults.
libtune is the latest in a series of attempts to do this dynamic
runtime adjustment (hell, I even started such a project myself
back circa 2000 which thankfully never really took off).
It's a bad idea that just won't die.
