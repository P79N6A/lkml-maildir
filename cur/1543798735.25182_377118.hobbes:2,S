It is not irrelevant because many architectures that would care are ll/sc
based and many others have a native cmpxchg ie. cmpxchg wouldn't be a bad
choice for default.

Read Russell's posts. He points out that most usages of cmpxchg
will require an additional load compared with an llsc in order to
find the value to work on.
cmpxchg(lock, UNLOCKED, LOCKED)
does not (although it may still require an extra branch).
