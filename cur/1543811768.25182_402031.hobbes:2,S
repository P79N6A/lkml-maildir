I think it could be implemented meaningfully on ppc64, mips64, and 
perhaps some parisc systems, but I don't think their respective 
maintainers have gotten around to that yet.
Anyway, it looks like the write combine ordering Bryan is talking about 
really is a distinct semantic.  Not sure if it's possible (or desirable) 
to overload an existing barrier op to include the semantics he wants.
