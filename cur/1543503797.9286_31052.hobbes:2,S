After a short uptime the system will lock.  Before it locks I got thousands
of log messages like:
kernel: PYXIS machine check NOT expected
Then the machine would just lockup, this is using the SYM driver on 2.2.10.
 I tested 2.2.11-pre2 kernel out on the same dirver and the PYXIS messages
came back again.
