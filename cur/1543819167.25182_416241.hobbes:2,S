Al Since you have an unhealthy interest in cpu schedulers you may also want to 
look at my ultimate fairness with mild interactivity builtin cpu scheduler I 
hacked on briefly. I was bored for a couple of days and came up with the 
design and hacked it together. I never got around to finishing it to live up 
fully to its design intent but it's working embarassingly well at the moment. 
It makes no effort to optimise for interactivity in anyw way. Maybe if I ever 
find some spare time I'll give it more polish and port it to plugsched. 
Ignore the lovely name I give it; the patch is for 2.6.16. It's a dual 
priority array rr scheduler that iterates over all priorities. This is as 
opposed to staircase which is a single priority array scheduler where the 
tasks themselves iterate over all priorities.
