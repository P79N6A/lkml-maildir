Ok but the other choice I can agree with is to remove the two line
heuristic completly. I don't like a HZ/50 that can be shorter than the
time between two packet from the other end because in such case we will
wait but we won't avoid the ack. Maybe it works fine for most of you and
it's not a big issue for me (since HZ/50 is a pretty slow time anyway) but
I still don't like it.
