Yikes.

I like the idea of minimising the flushes where we can, however the idea
of having stale entries in the TLB's, even for a short time gives me the jibblies
a little. If this does cause any problems, they're likely to be of a nature that
would be incredibly difficult to track down.
(We've been bitten on more than one occasion due to missing flushes in this driver).
Given the wide variety of hardware this driver supports, I'd like this
to sit in -mm for a while, just to be on the safe side.
If Andrew picks that up now, that gives us a while for testing before 2.6.15 closes
for features.
