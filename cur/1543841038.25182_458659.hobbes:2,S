An easy but crude fix would be to add an according hint at the help text 
of the immediately superordinate config option. E.g. at IEEE1394: "Also 
enable SCSI support to be able to switch on SBP-2 support (IEEE 1394 
protocol e.g. for storage devices)." But this is extremely ugly /1./ 
because it would litter help texts of generic options with redundant 
information about specific options and /2./ because it requires users to 
find and read help texts in order to convince the configurator to make 
options visible.
