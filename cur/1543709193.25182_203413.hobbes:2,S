It seems unintuitive, although having heard the arguments, I can
understand why it works this way.
I was thinking that epoll should behave like a file descriptor (i.e. a
child can close an inherited fd without affecting the parent), simply
because the only connection a process has with epoll is the file
descriptor. I suppose if you think of epoll_ctl() and epoll_wait() as
write()s and read()s on the file descriptor, then it makes sense that
these operations would affect both processes.
It still feels 'wrong' though :)
