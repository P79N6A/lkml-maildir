  I am not familiar with semaphore or x86, so this may not be correct,
but if the following sequence is possible, the writer can call wake_up()
before the reader calls add_wait_queue() and reader may sleep forever.
Is it possible?
Reader							Writer
    down_read:
	lock incl (%sem)
	js __down_read_failed
						    up_write:
							lock andl $0x3fffffff,(%sem)
							jne __up_write_wakeup
						    __up_write_wakeup:
							spin_lock(&sem->lock);
							wake_up(&sem->waiters);
							spin_unlock(&sem->lock);
    __down_read_failed:
	spin_lock(%sem->lock)
	add_wait_queue(&sem->waiters, &wait);
	.
	.
