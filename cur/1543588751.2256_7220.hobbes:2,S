One of my testcases fell over on it...

I don't use XCHG anywhere... do you mean CMPXCHG?

It tries not to let the "active count" transition 1->0 happen if it can avoid
it (ie: it would rather wake someone up and not decrement the count). It also
only calls __rwsem_do_wake() if the caller manages to transition the active
count 0->1.
This avoids another subtle bug that I think I have a sequence written down for
too.

Not so... my down-failed slowpath functions return sem in EAX.

There must be a performance issue too, otherwise our read up/down fastpaths
are the same. Which clearly they're not.

I used to do that.

It benchmarked faster without it for me. I suspect this will be different on
different CPUs anyway.
I'm going to have to have a play with Intel's VTUNE program and see what it
says.

But the instructions you've specified aren't 64-bit.

My point is that mine isn't mandatory either... You just don't set the XADD
config option.
