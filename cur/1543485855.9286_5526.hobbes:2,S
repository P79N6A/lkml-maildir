Kernel stack corruption usually occurs when the stack overflows.  There is
no check for the overflow that I know of.
This happened to me during the development of the Overlay Filesystem many
times due to a recursive function call.
Try to make sure that your source does not run into any recursions;
especially deep ones, and that you do not allocate too much memory on the
stack, as in the following example:
	bad_kernel_function (int x)
	{
		struct some_large_struct	array[1024];
	}
Another possibility is that your source may have a pointer problem where
it overruns an object on the stack, thereby overwritting the MAGIC number
for some process on the stack, such as:
	bad_kernel_function2 (int x)
	{
		char	buf[256];
		char	*ptr;
		...
		ptr = buf + strlen(buf) - 1;
		while ( ptr != ':' )
			ptr--;
		ptr[0] = '\0';
		...
	}
The code that you pointed out that checks the stack is a sanity
check that indicates that there is a problem with the stack; it
checks when a process is completed by looking for the MAGIC
number that gets put on the stack when the process is started.
