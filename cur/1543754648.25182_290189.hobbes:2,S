I do not understand your objection.  The processor module does not call
the interfaces in question directly.  They are called only from arch
setup code (e.g. arch/ia64/kernel/topology.c) which is never built as a
module.

Sure -- the arch_register_cpu and arch_unregister_cpu symbols need to be
exported for this use (and they are).  Exporting register_cpu and
unregister_cpu is unnecessary.
I double-checked an ia64 build with CONFIG_ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU=y and
CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=m and saw no errors or warnings caused by the
change...
