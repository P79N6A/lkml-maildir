Previous code also reserved the backup memory region after crash kernel
region. It is just a matter of interpretation. What I understand that
crash kernel reserved region represents something where one can load the
panic kernel directly and new kernel can use this memory region for
memory allocation.
I don't want to steal the backup region from crash kernel region
otherwise, I shall have to boot the crash kernel with some strange
values like memmap=(32M-640k)@16M (symbolically) to prevent crash kernel
overwriting backup region. Why to make user aware of location of backup
region.
Alternatively, this can be managed by reserving this backup region again
in crash kernel to avoid any stomping. May be pass backup region
location to new kernel through parameter segment or through command line
but don't see a strong reason for doing that.
Thanks
