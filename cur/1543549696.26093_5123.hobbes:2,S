Hmm, I think these two are orthagonal.
__GFP_HIGH means that we are allowed to eat deeper into
the free list (maybe needed to avoid a deadlock freeing
pages)
__GFP_SOFT would mean "don't bother waiting for free pages",
which is something very different...
(I wouldn't want a user process to get killed simply because
kswapd is waiting for IO to finish on a swapout, in that case
we really do want to sleep for a while)
