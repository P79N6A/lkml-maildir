I didn't mention that I had a problem with it.  I do have some
questions.
If I one day had the idea of building a filesystem where version
control is inherent, could this be done with BK?  Further, I
understand the design of EXT3 uses a form of multiversion concurrency
to ensure metadata integrity.  Does this constitute "substantially
similar capabilities?"  That's pretty damn vague.
