  OK, those are easy enough to comment out but I thought the broken-out
tar file would be cleaner than that.

  While playing with this cleanup script:
===============================================================================
#! /bin/bash
[ -f patches/series ]  ||  exit 1
echo $"Refreshing all patches in series..."
quilt pop -a
cat patches/series  |  while read line
do
	lineno=$[$lineno+1]
	if [ -z "$line" ]  ||  [ "${line:0:1}" == "#" ]
	then
		continue
	fi
	echo ""
	quilt push $line
	if [ $? != 0 ]
	then
		echo -e $"\nError at line" $lineno ":"
		echo -e $line
		break
	fi
	quilt refresh
done
===============================================================================
  I found:
===============================================================================
Usage: quilt push [-afqv] [--leave-rejects] [num|patch]
Error at line 308 :

===============================================================================
  I thought this was an isolated instance and fixed it up, then found:
        x86-64-ptrace-ia32-bp-fix.patch # ak no likee
This breaks quilt when you try to push patches by name:
===============================================================================
[me@d2 2.6.13-rc2-mm2]$ quilt push x86-64-ptrace-ia32-bp-fix.patch
Applying x86-64-ptrace-ia32-bp-fix.patch
patch: no: extra operand
patch: Try `/usr/bin/patch --help' for more information.
Patch x86-64-ptrace-ia32-bp-fix.patch does not apply (enforce with -f)
===============================================================================
  Quilt docs only say lines beginning with "#" are ignored, nothing about it
after a patch name.
  ...and BTW why does every line in the series file have a trailing space?
