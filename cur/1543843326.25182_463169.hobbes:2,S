funny. not to mention that it was not the only argument I presented but please 
tell us explicitly what's your reason to blow out kernel footprint by the code 
which can be handled outside the kernel. I'd prefer to see technical reasons a 
kind of latencies, etc but not  the constant refrain "don't touch cpufreq 
interface". Especially considering that proposed improvements _do_ _not_ 
_change_ the interface.
And just FYI kernel footprint was stated as one of main current issues at least 
on the last OLS.

I already did _proper_ submissions several time on IMO the _proper_ list.
