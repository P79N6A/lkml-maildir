Well, if you use the get_jiffies64() interface the 64-bit value is
always coherent as well, and the direct access to the 32-bit value
is monotonic.  While the high and low words of the 64-bit jiffies
values may be incoherent at times, as long as you always access the
64-bit value with the get_jiffies64() interface it should be OK.
Do you think that doing a 64-bit add-with-carry to memory on each
timer interrupt and doing multiple volatile reads is faster than
doing a spinlock with an optional 32-bit increment?  Do you think
there would be a lot of contention on this lock, given that you
only need to lock when you need the full 64-bit value?
Cheers, Andreas
