	At various stages different controllers were available with the core
patches or separately. The numtasks, cpu, io, socket accept queue, and
memory controllers were available for early CKRM patches. More recently
(April 2006) numtasks, cpu, and memory controllers were available for
Resource Groups.
	So I'd say "several".
