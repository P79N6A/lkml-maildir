Subject: [patch 0/2] softlockup watchdog improvements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's couple of patches to improve the softlockup watchdog.
The first changes the softlockup timer from using jiffies to sched_clock()
as a timebase.  Xen and VMI implement sched_clock() as counting unstolen
time, so time stolen by the hypervisor won't cause the watchdog to bite.
The second adds per-cpu enable flags for the watchdog timer.  This allows
the timer to be disabled when the CPU goes into a (potentially unbounded)
tickless sleep.
I know this conflicts with
fix-bogus-softlockup-warning-with-sysrq-t.patch in -mm2.  I think that
patch incorrectly changes the behaviour of the softlockup watchdog,
and a better solution is to temporarily disable the watchdog while
doing something known to be cpu-consuming, like a long sysreq output.
