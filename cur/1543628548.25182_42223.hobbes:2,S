Page coloring for 2.4.18+ isn't preempt save?
It gave ~10% speedup for memory intensive apps on my single  1 GHz Athlon II 
SlotA (0,18µm, L2 512K) but look the system hard from time to time. Nothing 
in the logs.
I've changed the patch for 2.4.19-pre7 + vm3 + latest rml-O(1) + preempt.
Thanks,
	Dieter
