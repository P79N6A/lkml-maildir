We all appreciate your hard work.

Is this something that could be automated with some machine power? 
e.g. every time a patch is added a small cluster could build the patches
with some configurations on various architectures and if it doesn't build 
autoflame the patch submitter.
We use this in SUSE for the SUSE kernels and it works quite well.
Maybe someone could contribute the build power needed for that. I suppose
it could be done by just a few scripts listening to mm-commits?
