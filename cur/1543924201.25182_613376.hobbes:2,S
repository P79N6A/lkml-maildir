The old PlanG approach. It's the way that we did MAC labels in
Trix4. It has the wicked advantage of working across NFS without
anyone being the wiser. It really causes trouble for backup
utilities, however. Trix6 (there wasn't really a Trix5) had xattrs
available and we found the switch well worth the investment.
