When exporting it outside the kernel tree, the '.' prefix should
definitely be stripped...  My preference is /boot/config-2.4.3 (with
/boot/config as a symlink to it)
Assuming your initscripts is smart about updating /boot symlinks, any
running kernel config [properly installed] can be grabbed with a simple
'cp /boot/config .'
