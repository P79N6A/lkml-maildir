I think of randconfig as
  "make config with random answers to all questions"
(Or did I miss something?)
This means that randconfig does not give totally random
configurations. The same restrictions apply for config,
randconfig and menuconfig. If not we might consider fixing
scripts/kconfig/conf.c and friends.
So in general a "randconfig" configurations can be generated by a user
as well. He just has to give the same answers during "make config"
as randconfig did.
I started this randconfig thing yesterday and up to now I have looked
at 16 (out of >66) configs which lead to kernel build errors with
the current git tree.
Of course I have seen duplicates of the problems reported.
But there were just 3 (all equal) bogus configurations. There randconfig
did not provide a proper file name for CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE.
This is the only case for which I would use the term "user error" or
"bogus randconfig".
IMHO if certain configurations are invalid we should use kconfig-language
to prevent them.
Ah and wrt to the above compile warning. Normally I would have ignored
it - but I looked at acpi code and its Kconfig anyway.
And It's easy to avoid such a warning to keep the terminal clear
for more interesting compile messages ;-)

Andreas
