Stephen,
This is only supported on the newer kernels.  Older Linux (2.0.38) does
not support a general purpose interface, or support the callback.  This
means that we will need to support multiple methods of doing this I/O to
cover all Linux versions.  It appears we will be synchronous on 2.0.38
and older Linux.  This is assuming I can find a way to get around the
fact that all of the functions needing to be called are not declared
"static" as they are today.
