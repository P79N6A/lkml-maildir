In the drivers I converted (~20 or so...) this is done already. You can 
find them at 
http://www.brodo.de/pcmcia/
 , for example the network drivers
(all of them should be converted) at
http://www.brodo.de/pcmcia/pcmcia-2.5.67-drivers_network
 .
For example, a part of pcnet_cs.c looks like this now:
static struct pcmcia_device_id pcnet_ids[] = {
	{ PCMCIA_DEVICE_VERS1("2412LAN", 0x67f236ab) },
	{ PCMCIA_DEVICE_VERS12("ACCTON", "EN2212", 0xdfc6b5b2, 0xcb112a11) },
	...
	{ PCMCIA_MFC_DEVICE_MANF_CARD(0, 0x0105, 0xea15) },
	{ },
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(pcmcia, pcnet_ids);
As strings can't be passed to userspace in file2alias.c, I've chosen the
crc32 value of the string as the matching identifier for the userspace
hotplug script. In-kernel matching uses the full string then. And _MFC_
stands for multi-function-card , function 0 of the card in the example above
will be bound to this driver. Oh, and I didn't do this parsing by hand --
wrote an ugly /etc/pcmcia/config --> pcmcia_device_id_table parser (which
works) and I'm willing to convert any entries still left over.
