The problem is with each drive on each controller. The problem is even
with no drive on no controller - as I've shown to you with my loop
example, because it does have exactly nothing to do with drives or
controllers at all but just with block devices and their block size.

And I'm horribly sure, that I don't have 32GB clipping enabled on
my 40, 80 or 160G drives :)
However - it has nothing to do with drives at all. Just with block
devices and block sizes. It's no physical problem but a logical one
and you can reproduce it on any drive you like just by creating
partitions big enough to force mke2fs to allocate (2048|4096) blocks
(or by creating small ones and force mke2fs manually) and with an
absolute size being a multiple of 1024 but none of (2048|4096).
