Hmm, i8042 already recognizes both PNP IDs from your DSDT:

I wonder what is going on... I see there was big ACPI update in -mm2,
could you try reverting bk-acpi.patch.
Btw, you said you are using 2.6.10-rc1 - is there -mm suffix missing?
Linus's tree does not have i8042 ACPI enumeration patch yet so 
i8042.noacpi does not have any effect and should not even be recognized
by the kernel.
