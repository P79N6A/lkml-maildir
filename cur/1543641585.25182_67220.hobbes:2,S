If cooling and power saving is what is wanted, why not talk
in terms of degrees or watts?  Or are you really trying to
say something like "it is ok to run this much slower to
conserve power/temp/battery".
I really think we need to push down the power/temp to Mhz
conversion to the lowest level.  At the user level we should
only be expressing what we want and/or are willing to give
up for it.  From this point of view, if you are talking
frequency you are already out of the box.
