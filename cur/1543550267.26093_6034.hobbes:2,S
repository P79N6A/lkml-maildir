Agreed. /proc/{pid}/stat backs you up there too. %u is fine, only %lu is
mangled by something.
It's certainly an amusing failure; I'm surprised by how well everything
runs with the system in this state; netstat and top fall over, uptime
calculations go wrong, and ps and inndwatch complain. Everything else is
happy as could be.
Whatever it is it probably isn't memory error; I do lots of gcc
compilations on this machine, and don't get nonrepeatable bootstrap
comparison failures...
I'll try pulling out some of the patches and modules (lm-sensors can go
easily; reiserfs not so easily) and see what happens.
