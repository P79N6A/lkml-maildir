Carlos, could you please run the following script as root:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/probe-ports.sh
and send us the resulting probe-ports.txt file?
This script will probe all unused ports as per /proc/ioports and will 
list "suspect" IO port areas: ones that do not produce the expected 0xff 
default reply from unclaimed IO ports. Magic chipset register areas can 
potentially be mapped this way.
[ CAREFUL: This probes IO ports which might in theory trigger various
  nastiness such as lockups. I this on a few boxes and the script
  worked, but save any work in case you get lockups. ]
