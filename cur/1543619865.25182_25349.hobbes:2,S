 : Undernet's IRCD + Lain 1.1.2 patch
Hmm.  Have a look at
http://www.mail-archive.com/coder-com@undernet.org/msg00060.html
It looks like the mainline Undernet ircd was rewritten around May 2001
to support high efficiency techniques like /dev/poll and kqueue.
The source you pointed to is way behind Undernet's current sources.
Undernet's ircd has engine_{select,poll,devpoll,kqueue}.c, 
but not yet an engine_rtsig.c, as far as I know.
If you want ircd to handle zillions of simultaneous connections
on a stock 2.4 Linux kernel, rtsignals are the way to go at the
moment.  What's needed is to write ircd's engine_rtsig.c, and 
modify ircd's os_linux.c to notice EWOULDBLOCK
return values and feed them to engine_rtsig.c (that's the icky
part about the way linux currently does this kind of event 
notification - signals are used for 'I'm ready now', but return
values from I/O functions are where you learn 'I'm no longer ready').
So I dunno if I'm going to go ahead and do that myself, but at least I've
scoped out the situation.  Before I did any work, I'd measure CPU
usage under a simulated load of 2000 clients, just to verify that
poll() was indeed a bottleneck (ok, can't imagine it not being a
bottleneck, but it's nice to have a baseline to compare the improved
version against).
