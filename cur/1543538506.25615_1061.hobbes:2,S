But it has allready been said for example that the need to delete
large files (a don't do that) exists for audio apps.  So while
the latency may possibly be there, the rest of the requirements
are not..
This says to me that someone interested in doing audio needs to
examine WHY large files can't be deleted (and the other don't do
that's) and try to solve THOSE problems as well - but in a non
kludge way that also benefits the general uses of the kernel -
not just for the special purpose of audio recording.
