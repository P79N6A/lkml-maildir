The question is: Who starts and leads seriously this effort (and takes
in the course others with him)?
Just telling others where to go and waiting until they carry you there
usually doesn't succeed if you are not the boss of them (and/or they
are free to leave at any time without significant punishment).

Perhaps speaking is not enough and work should follow?
All people who really do the work like those others standing beneath
(possibly doing their own thing) and telling them how to do their own
work best.

It's at most (and actually exactly) "my work - your work", not "my balls
- your balls" (or "code" or whatever).
If you want to play "our work" (read: team[0] work), than you have to
cope with others (and they with you), their - probably historically
grown - design (even if it is wrong), etc.
If this doesn't work (and ATM I have this impression) for whatever
reason, the second step is "my work, your work".
And if two (or more) people have different design opinions (and
different opinions about "quality" and/or "correct vs wrong" - I can't
decide since I have virtually no knowledge about SCSI core internals,
discussions on the Linux-SCSI-ML, etc. to decide - not even for me -,
who is "right" and/or "wrong" in which aspect or in general), it comes
down to "better the not-so-good design and working code than the best
design and no code".
So just copy the old core, throw out what you don't want, need and/or
like and voila. If it *is* "better", it will succeed and people will
come and help.
Of course it is probably more work in the short and in the long run to
maintain a separate block driver for SAS storage, but it is at least a
possible solution.
Perhaps all relevant people will see that the difference is small enough
to converge to some point in between.
