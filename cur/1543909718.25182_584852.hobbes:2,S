Because msleep_interruptible() is in a separate compilation unit,
the compiler has to assume that it might modify any arbitrary global.
In many cases, the compiler also has to assume that msleep_interruptible()
might call back into a function in the current compilation unit, thus
possibly modifying global static variables.
