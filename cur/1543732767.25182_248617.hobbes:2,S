another thing: could you try maxcpus=1 again and see whether 1 CPU
produces similar 'slow motion' traces? If it's DMA or PCI bus traffic
somehow interfering then i'd expect the same phenomenon to pop up with a
single CPU too. IIRC you tested an UP kernel once before, but i believe
that was prior fixing all the latency measurement errors. Would be nice
to re-test again, with maxcpus=1, and see whether any of these
slow-motion traces trigger. On a 1-CPU test i'd suggest to lower the
tracing threshold to half of the 2-CPU value.
