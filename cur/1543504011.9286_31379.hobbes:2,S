Hi all,
I am having trouble getting the 2.2.10-ac12 to boot. My system
is alpha LX164 w/ NCR53c875.
Using 2.2.10 can boot fine without any problems, however, using
2.2.10-ac12 will give "CACHE TEST FAILED: ncr wrote 2, host read 0"
error and machine rebooted.
I have another machine using NCR53c860 can boot find w/
2.2.10-ac12 also.
Here is the exact output (copy by hand from console):
ncr53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 6, function 0
ncr53c8xx: 53c875 detected with Symbios NVRAM
ncr53c875-0: rev=0x04, base=0x9000000, io_port=0x8000, irq=16
ncr53c875-0: Symbios format NVRAM, ID 7, Fast-20, Parity Checking
ncr53c875-0: initial SCNTL3/DMODE/DCNTL/CTEST3/4/5 = (hex) 05/46/a0/00/00/24
ncr53c875-0: final SCNTL3/DMODE/DCNTL/CTEST3/4/5 = (hex) 05/46/a0/00/08/24
ncr53c875-0: on-chip RAM at 0x9001000
CACHE TEST FAILED: ncr wrote 2, host read 0
CACHE TEST FAILED: ncr wrote 2, read back 0
CACHE Incorrectly Configured
Any suggestion will be appreciated. (I need the ac patch for the
large file descriptor)
Regards,
Tom
