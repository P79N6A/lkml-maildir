As you perhaps noticed, this is already used on very basic packets (the
selfIDs which are the first ones generated by PHYs after each bus
reset). Therefore I suppose that it works also on 64bit architectures
even though they are certainly less extensively tested than 32bit ones.
But since there are no guarantees for it to work as intended,...
