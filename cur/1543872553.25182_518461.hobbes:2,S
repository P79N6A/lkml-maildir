I can't quite follow that line of thought. Why does s390 need the number
of arguments? The wrapper of a compat system call implicitly knows how
many arguments a system calls to do the conversion. For a normal system
call we just call the function. Random example sys_read: the user space
loads the arguments to register %r2, %r3, %r4 and calls the system. The
register are not touched until sys_read is reached. Only sys_read cares
about the number of arguments in this case.
