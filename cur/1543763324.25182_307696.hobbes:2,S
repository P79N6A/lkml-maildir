    Not exactly. My doubt is not about whether use symlinks to linux
and asm in the linux kernel or not, is about using what glibc people
prefer or seem to prefer (raw kernel headers) or using llh. I know
that I don't have to use the current kernel headers in /usr/include,
but the ones used when compiling my libc or (better) llh.
    Thanks anyway :)
