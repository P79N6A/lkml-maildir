Hi Pauline,
That stripping happens in the rule for building $(O_TARGET):
    # Rules.make
    $(LD) $(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) -r -o $@ $(filter $(ALL_O), $^)
The Gnu Make documentation guarantees that $^ has no duplicates.
It's tricky but it was the quickest way to remove the duplicates
while preserving order.
This will be documented soon in Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt.
I really want Makefile writers to have some documentation to rely on,
rather than wondering if some property in Rules.make is a guarantee
or an accident of the moment.
