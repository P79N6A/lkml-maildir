>What about a kind of timer ?
The functions are run serially.  If I'm to wait, I must block
or risk having the machine powered off prior to completing my shutdown.
A coworker of mine playing with the MD code reminded me that
he had to change the priority of the MD notifier to make it work.
I believe that this is the correct fix as there are other SCSI
drivers that have shutdown hooks.
All HBA drivers currently use 0 (or the lowest) as their priority.
MD (line 3475 of drivers/md/md.c) uses 0 too.  Change it to INT_MAX
and MD will always get shutdown prior to any child devices it might
use.
