Yes I am seeing a similar type of behavior.  Once a server starts swapping,
it continues to swap heavily until it locks up.  I only see it happen on my
web servers (all running apache 1.3.9).  My 3 other boxes ( similar
hardware to my webservers) that run mail, firewall and X have 100+ days of
uptime, so it seems like it is some activity that the web server does that
spurs this problem on.  I've compiled in ikd to a couple of my servers and
am working on setting up a test environment to see if I can recreate this
problem on a test machine.  If I get anything useful, I will post it to l-k.
