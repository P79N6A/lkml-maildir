Why not compare more equal pages? freedesktop.org also runs gitweb:
  
http://gitweb.freedesktop.org

Adding "enable-index-links=1" to /etc/cgitrc will print links to "summary",
"log" and "tree" for each repository line, but you still have to open the
summary page to get the git (clone) link. It wouldn't be very hard to add
another link (see 
http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/tree/ui-repolist.c#n96
), but I'm
not sure what actual value such a link would provide.

The similar page in gitweb:
  
http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=hal.git;a=summary

The similar page in cgit:
  
http://hjemli.net/git/linux/

IMHO the sidebar makes cgit way easier to navigate (especially the dropdown box
to switch between branches is pretty handy).

There's always the link in the sidebar ;-)
But seriously, showing the diff on the same page as the commit message would
sometimes be nice and sometimes it would be a bit too much:
http://hjemli.net/git/linux/commit/?id=b5faa4b89e4d83203b1f44f143a351b518f7cda2
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/misc-2.6.git;a=commit;h=b5faa4b89e4d83203b1f44f143a351b518f7cda2

I belive cgit and gitweb displays roughly the same information on their commit
pages; I don't see a diff in gitweb either unless I click one of the diff-
links.

Yes, gitweb definitly looks more polished. It's a bit slow, though...
Another remark - IMHO there are some practical benefits to be had from the
virtual url support in cgit, e.g. linking to blobs:
http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xorg/xserver.git;a=blob;h=ace11817054bfb5bcc8d55a31bd51b9dea49bbed;hb=fe25f897c62bb324660217e15dbd3091c808dbba;f=GL/mesa/X/Makefile.am
