The reservation happens in drivers/pnp/system.c, and it does mark the
region as "not busy."
I think the problem here is that the PCI BAR is bigger and spans the
region reported by ACPI:
[   22.906654] system 00:08: iomem range 0xfebfa000-0xfebfac00 has been reserved
[   31.133141] PCI: Unable to reserve mem region #1:4000@febf8000 for device 0000:00:1b.0
We can easily add more BIOSes to the PNP quirk.
I really don't want to use the earlier quirk that scanned PCI devices
from a PNP quirk.  I think that's just wrong because PNP (which
conceptually includes ACPI) is what tells us about PCI root bridges.
