Well, I have a few ideas that are hopefully useul.
- If you have not done so already, then go in to the "Kernel Hacking"
section of the kernel configuration and enable some (all?) of the
debug options and see if that produces anything that will help you
track down the problem.
- You could enable 'magic sysrq' and see if you can manage to get a
backtrace with it when it hangs (see Documentation/sysrq.txt) (ohh and
raise the console log level so you get all messages, including debug
ones).
- You could also try kdb (
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/
) or kgdb
(
http://kgdb.linsyssoft.com/
). That might help you pinpoint the
failure.
See also : 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/112
- If you have (or can identify) an older, working, kernel version and
you are confident that you can reproduce the problem reliably, then
doing a git bisection search starting with your newest "known good"
and oldest "known bad" kernel versions, should help you pinpoint the
commit causing the breakage.
Hope some of that helps :)
