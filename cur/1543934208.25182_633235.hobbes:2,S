You missed a word "wrongly". It has been "wrongly stated"
I've been going through the ISA cases which are the majority. Generally
speaking they are correct. We have a couple of "interesting" PCI users
who most definitely want udelay() or removal of _p. We have various
chipset cases which want looking at in detail. The ISA drivers however
are both the main user and mostly right.

If you use wall clock timings it will be slower.
