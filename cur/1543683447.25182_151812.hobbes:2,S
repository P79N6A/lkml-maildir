Hello,
I figured out some strange behaviour of the alsa drivers in kernel
2.6.0-test1-ac3. 
When compiling everything into the kernel (=y), I was not able to get
sound out of my machine at all. But with CONFIG_SND_VIA82XX=m it worked.
Isn't that strange?
I have got an EPOX 8K9A9i Mainboard with VIA8233 / ALC650 audio.
I attach more info below.
Regards, claas
