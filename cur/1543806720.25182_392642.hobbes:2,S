CONFIG_SCSI???
Why not using fully dynamical loadable kernel modules as done with Solaris 
since 1992? Since that time nobody cares because what you need is auto-loaded 
on demand and there is absolutely no need for a manual configuration.
BTW: Introducing an orthogonal SCSI based implementation would save a lot of
code. The model currently used on Linux is duplicating a lot of unneeded code 
in target drivers and the SCSI glue code is only a few KB (less than 30k on 
Solaris).
