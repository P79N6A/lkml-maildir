What about the following?
config IPMI_HANDLER
      tristate 'IPMI top-level message handler'
      help
        This enables the central IPMI message handler, required for IPMI
        to work.
        IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is one standard 
        for managing sensors (temperature, voltage, etc.) in a system.
        See Documentation/IPMI.txt for more details.
        If unsure, say N.
