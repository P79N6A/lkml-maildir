Good point; I'll add some comments.  The reason is that asm/linkage.h
ends up being included as a result of the other header file changes, and
it conflicts with the use of ENTRY and ALIGN here.  But its possible
that asm/linkage isn't needed anymore; that would be ideal if true.

Yes, but it happens after asm/paravirt.h has already included some
things, and it ends up causing problems.  paravirt.h still defines
various stub functions in the !CONFIG_PARAVIRT case, so it needs to do
the includes either way.
