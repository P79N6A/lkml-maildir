I have now tried this patch. I don't see a sync error now, but the
button still does not work as expected. Now the scroll down button
acts like a middle button instead of scrolling down.
I am sorry for the confusion; on my laptop it looks like a single
button, but in fact it can be pressed in four different ways (up,
down, left, and right). In 2.6.23, pressing left or right, I get the
traditional paste functionality. Pressing up or down, it acts like a
scroll wheel (up or down). In 2.6.24-rc1, it is the scrolling up/down
that causes the lost sync (but the left/right works correctly).
