Care to give us a hint? :)

Well the vma+pagetables *are* our VM translation data structure. It is
a good data structure. The Gelato/UNSW guys experimenting with changing
this have basically said they haven't yet got anything that beats it.
I would be opposed to anything that bypasses that unless a) it is not
applicable to the VM as a whole, and b) it is really worth it
(hugepages was a reasonable exception).

Yeah you could, but it looks back to front to me.
The VM tells the filesystem that the machine took a fault at virtual
address X, then the filesystem asks the VM what pgoff that is, then
tells the VM to install the corresponding page to vaddr X.
With my ->fault, the VM asks the filesystem to give the page that
corresponds to vaddr X, then installs it into that vaddr.

Sure it *could* be done, but it may not be very nice, given Linux's
design. And you definitely need _something_ other than just the
pagecache radix-tree, because the VM needs to know who maps the page.
So if, for your backing store, you use a small hash table and evict old
entries like powerpc, you'll constantly be faulting in and out pages
from the VM's high level view of the address space. That isn't a really
cheap operation. It takes at least:
read_lock_irq(mapping->tree_lock);
radix_tree_lookup()
read_unlock_irq(mapping->tree_lock);
lock_page()
atomic_add(page->_count)
atomic_add(page->_mapcount)
unlock_page()
atomic_add_negative(page->_mapcount)
atomic_dec_and_test(page->_count)
Compared to our current page table walk which is just a single locked
op + barrier for the spinlock + radix tree walk.
If you had a very large hash table (ia64 long mode, maybe?), then you
may have slightly fewer high level faults, but range based operations
are going to take a whole lot of cache misses, aren't they? Especially
for small processes.
Not that I wouldn't be happy to be proven wrong, but I don't think it
should be something that sneaks in under these pagetable operations.
IMO.
