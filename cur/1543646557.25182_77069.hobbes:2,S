yes, but does Larry realize that BK creates a situation in where 'our
bits' are separated into 'data' and 'metadata', in which currently only
"BitMover, or any other operator of an Open Logging server" has a default
permission to "republish the Metadata sent by the BitKeeper Software to
the Open Logging server".
i'd be happy if data and metadata could be considered one work, which is
covered by the GPL as a whole - is it?
