	Hello All,  Found the difficulty .  The cdrom drive itself was
	improperly attached to its controller , which made it improperly
	terminated also .  But even after rechecking everything I could
	lay my hands on .  This particular cdrom drive with the same
	cd image still has a bit of flakiness , in that it will get a
	request from the system and hang for a second or two then respond .  
	Maybe the drive itself going away ?  Or dirty ?, ...
