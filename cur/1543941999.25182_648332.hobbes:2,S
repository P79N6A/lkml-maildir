This operation is not totally unusual. I could use it for my optimised
page lock patches for example (although I need an operation that clears
a flag and has release semantics, but similar class of "thing").

And this is a store-for-unlock (eg. with release semantics).
Nothing too special about that either I guess. (it is almost the word
equivalent of clear_bit_unlock).

The load you are trying to avoid in the lock really isn't that
expensive. The cacheline is in L1. Even after a store, many CPUs
have store forwarding so it is probably not going to matter at all
on those.
Anyway, not saying the operations are useless, but they should be
made available to core kernel and implemented per-arch. (if they are
found to be useful)
