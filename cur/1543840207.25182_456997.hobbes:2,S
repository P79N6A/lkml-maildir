So, what's the bug? You shouldn't rely on these semantics anyway
because you should never expect to wait for a spinlock for so long
(and it may be the case that irqs can't be enabled anyway).
BTW. you should be cc'ing Andi Kleen (x86+/-64 maintainer) on
this type of stuff.
No comments on the merits of adding this feature. I suppose parity
with i386 is a good thing, though.
