Great.  It _should_ just work, I tested it with patches that included
binaries which changed, it handles that.  I suspect we'll find some
case which doesn't work some day (symlinks can't be represented in 
a patch for example) but you can always reget things from scratch,
that will work for contents, permissions, symlinks, the works.

Hey, it's open source, I'm hoping that people will take that code and
evolve it do whatever they need.  We're willing to do what we can on
this end if people need protocol changes to support new features, 
time permitting.  Think of that code as a prototype.  It's really
simple, you can hack it trivially.
If you want us to distribute your changes then send a patch, if not
that's cool too.  You can take that and evolve it to your heart's
content.  If you need a different license to start hacking let me
know what you want, I really don't care, you can have that code 
as public domain if you like.
