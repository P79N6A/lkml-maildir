It didn't become necessary as a result of the GPLv3 forbidding it. As I 
pointed out in text that was cut to keep the post short, there could be any 
number of reasons why "tivoization" is needed by the manufacturer. Other 
people have also pointed that out. This whole bit was to point out that you 
were inferring circular logic where none existed.

That 10% was, IIRC, a reference to the potential number of "Hackers" that 
would own a TiVO. On thinking about it I realized that the number of hackers 
owning a TiVO would be vanishingly small because of "tivoization". So in this 
new set of numbers I dropped it entirely.

Wrong. Nobody here needs a "piece by piece" explanation. So, in the belief 
that you were intelligent enough to understand that, I was providing proof 
that refutes your argument entirely.
With a situation as complex as what exists you can't split the argument into 
two and claim that, since "Argument A" is true in the "split" argument that 
it is true when the argument isn't split. This holds true for almost all 
real-world situations.
Now, I am not enjoying the discussion anymore. I've asked once before - remove 
me from the CC list.
