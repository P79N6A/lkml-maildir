Subject: How to re-send out the packets captured by my hook function at NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING

Hi, I plugged a callback function into netfilter at the hook point of
NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING, tring to capture all the packets, make
some changes to some of them, and invoke skb->dev->hard_start_xmit to
send them out directly. However, the kernel crashed before I could get
any printked information.
If you have any idea of how to send the received packets out, please tell me.
Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
Gu, Xinxing
