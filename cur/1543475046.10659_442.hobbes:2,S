Subject: NFS Corruption ... IT IS STILL PRESENT in 2.2.0pre4

I'm afraid I can still reproduce file corruption running NFS from
a 2.2.0pre4 client to a SunOS 5.5.1 server. The good news is that
is basically fails on _every_ test trial and it fails with a small
set of files. (My failure occurs doing an 'ld' over NFS).
Note that this problem does not occur between Linux boxes. I ran
1000's of iterations of the 'ld' command in question between three
different Linux'en running 2.2.0pre3 and there were no errors.
I still have several suggestions from Bill Hawes on how to gather
some data on this so I'll attempt to get some useful NFS debug
logs before the end of the day today. (That's by 5pm USA EST).
I'll send it to Bill Hawes and to the list.

P.S. I hate to drop this bomb so late in the process but I saw several
posting's discussing NFS bug fixes and success with NFS so I thought
the corruption problem was fixed. My testing this weekend was supposed
to be a quick validation of the fixes...
