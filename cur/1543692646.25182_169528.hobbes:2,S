Here is some oddity. I've compiled all sound stuff into kernel. I've
also have devfs enabled, and I've put in /etc/modules.conf [1]:
alias snd-card-0 snd-emu10k1
alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
And here is what dmesg says with 2.6.0-test6 [2]:
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.9.7 (Thu Sep 25 19:16:36 2003 UTC).
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- snd-card-0. error = -16
ALSA device list:
  #0: Sound Blaster Live! (rev.7) at 0xd800, irq 10
Hah???
[1]: devfsd reads /etc/modules.conf, but module-init-tools use
modprobe.conf. Should't this be changed?
[2]: I haven't tried that with test5, but I suppose the same thing would
happen.
