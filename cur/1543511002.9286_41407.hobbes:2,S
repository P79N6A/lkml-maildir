I'm having exactly the same problems, hard lock and no debug messages.
Magic sys-req are dead too, but ATX reset still works. I'm running
2.2.12 SMP, IDE root fs, Adaptec 2940 SCSI with a DVD, and a Realtek 8139.
I'm prepared to go out on a limb and finger the Realtek card. I was 
running exactly the same config without the card for about two weeks
and without any problems at all. Now I get a lockup about once every
two days or so.
cheers,
aaron
