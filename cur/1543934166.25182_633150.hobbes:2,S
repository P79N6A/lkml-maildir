I have this code:
<c_code>
/* 
 * osd-r10 4.12.5 Data-In and Data-Out buffer offsets
 * byte offset = mantissa * (2^(exponent+8))
 */
typedef __be32 osd_cdb_offset;
osd_cdb_offset __osd_encode_offset(u64 offset, unsigned *padding,
	int min_shift, int max_shift);
struct osd_attributes_list_mode {
	__be32		get_attr_desc_bytes;
	osd_cdb_offset	get_attr_desc_offset;
	__be32		get_attr_alloc_length;
	osd_cdb_offset	get_attr_offset;
	__be32		set_attr_bytes;
	osd_cdb_offset	set_attr_offset;
	__be32 not_used;
};
</c_code>
the osd_cdb_offset above is this special OSD-standard floating-point-like
special type. It is of size 32 bit in special network order. What should
I do then:
__be32 __osd_encode_offset(u64 offset, unsigned *padding,
	int min_shift, int max_shift);
But it is not a __be32. It is this special floating-point-like thingy!!!?
How was __be32 defined with a #define???!!
Come on guys, it is not checkpatch.pl place to complain about good language
constructs that can be misused. This is the maintainers and reviewers
job to say that a: "typedef struct foo Foo;" is bad practice and we don't
like it, but it can not be left to a script. "typedef"s should be used
where they should be used.
