All I do is ensure that typeof(x) is assignment compatible with typeof(*ptr).
That is what the assignment to the temporary does.  We actually do
this already on x86 if you compile for an i386 which people very rarely
do anymore.
I have performed sever kernel compiles with it applied against the stable
tree and saw no errors other than when I tried to assign a pointer to an
integer using put_user.
So your eight-byte struct case would probably be caught but the character
case would get type promoted and be fine.

I guess we could do that.  However if we don't use the value we will probably
get an unused variable warning.  
Mostly I am just after the normal C assignment warnings/errors.  Although if
we can do better that would be great.
