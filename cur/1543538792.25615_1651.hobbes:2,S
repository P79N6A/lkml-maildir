Subject: SIGSEGV on fclose.

On linux I get a SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault if I close a nonopen file.
On unix platforms, this is either simply ignored or an appropiate
errormessage is returned, and according to the linux manualpage fclose
on linux should return EBADF.
I have testet the following example on AIX 4.3, Solaris 7, FreeBSD 4.0,
TRU64, HPUX 10.20, SCO ODT5, linux kernel 2.2.15 and linux kernel
2.2.13.
in case you wonder: the problem arises from a program that closes a 
file twice because it does not know that the file is allready closed.
Regards,
Bjarne
