Yup.

Well.. Passing trigger parameter to activate/deactivate function is not
only purpose of that patch...

Subject: [PATCH] Attach trigger to LED prior calling activate function.
This change needed for two purposes:
1. When somebody sets trigger, and that trigger would setup
   brightness in its activate() function, and led driver would check
   if that trigger supported (used by hwtimer trigger and drivers
   supporting hw blinking LEDs, not in mainline yet).
2. If trigger would access itself through led_cdev in its activate()
   function.
Pros of that patch:
1. Just sane to do;
2. Trivial;
3. Can't break anything;
4. No new code, just one line movement.
Cons of applying that patch:
1. No mainline kernel user, but offshores.
