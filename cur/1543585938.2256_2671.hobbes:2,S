I have 2 ideas:
* glibc corrupted
* did you downgrade the cpu?
RH 7.0 automatically installs glibc for a Pentium Pro or later if that
cpu is present during install.
If you then move the hd into a computer with an AMD K6, it won't boot.
I'd run
#rpm -Va
and check if some unusual files are modified (...5.. without "c")
