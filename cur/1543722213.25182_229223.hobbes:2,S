Thsi reminds me...
I really loath all the preprocessor macros.  I know there are plenty
of this already, but I don't see the advantage of macros over (static)
inline functions which IMO look cleaner and give gcc some change to
sanitize what it's looking at without actually having to have it used.
Is there a reason why we keep doing this?
