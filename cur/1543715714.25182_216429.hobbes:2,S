It's that 1-order allocation which is causing the problem.  I thought we'd
beaten this behaviour out of the slab code but it seems not.
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.6-rc2/2.6.6-rc2-mm2/broken-out/slab-order-0-for-vfs-caches.patch
is not a completely happy solution, but it should fix things up.
