Hi!
I pretty much screwed up in the last update you merged for 2.6.11,
making USB input devices rather annoying to use. These four patches fix
the damage made:
1) The MUX mode disabling had a bug that caused it to not work at
   all.
2) MSC_SCAN events backpropagating into hid-input.c caused a flood
   of 'event field not found' messages in the syslog.
3) USB keyboad LEDs stopped working due to a fix for Logitech mouse
   fake LEDs.
4) The fourth patch is a documentation update from Andries Brouwer.
Please include these before the final 2.6.11, or drop the last input
update.
As usual, they're available at:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/vojtech/for-linus
as well as in the following mails of this thread.
Thanks,
