Eric,
I found myself in similar situations in the past, and my solution was
to establish a small file of "do not report" symbols. I then use this
file to avoid reporting problems with items that I know are being
handled or are known false positives. Yes, it is not automagic, but
it does do the job.
The file might also include private notes as to the status of each
excluded symbol.
