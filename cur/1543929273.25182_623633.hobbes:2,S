+       r = kvm_hypercall1(KVM_PV_PCI_DEVICE, page_gfn);
Setup is done by:
+       if (!kvm_para_available()) {
+               printk(KERN_ERR "KVM paravirt support not available\n");
+               r = -ENODEV;
+               goto out_dereg;
+       }
I also couldn't get the has_feature to work properly.
See:

I had to change the hypercall address to 0f 01 d9 for it to get working.
