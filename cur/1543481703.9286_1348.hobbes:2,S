Those who have problem with freezing netscape,
please try the following code. If it helps, we
are sure that the kernel is not the problem.
It works for me with 2.2.0-final and Netscape 4.5,
I have not tested it very carefully and I don't
guarantee it works anywhere else.
Thanks

/* This is a netscape bug workaround. Search for a pipe,
   where only 1 byte strings \0372 are written to the write
   end and only 1 byte strings are requested back. Count
   the difference and fake any writes that would cause
   an overflow of the pipe and corresponding reads.
   This is a really dirty hack with almost no error checking
   and relying on the netscape's behaviour.
   Compile with
     gcc -c nspipepatch.c
     ld -shared -o libnspipepatch.so -ldl nspipepatch.o
   and add
     LD_PRELOAD=<path>/libnspipepatch.so
   to your netscape starting script.
