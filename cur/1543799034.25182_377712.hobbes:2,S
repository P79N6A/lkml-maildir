Hello!
If I set "PCI access mode" in the configuration to "MMConfig", the build
fails:
arch/i386/pci/built-in.o(.text+0x3a2): In function `pci_mmcfg_read':
mmconfig.c: undefined reference to `pci_conf1_read'
arch/i386/pci/built-in.o(.text+0x4b6): In function `pci_mmcfg_write':
mmconfig.c: undefined reference to `pci_conf1_write'
arch/i386/pci/built-in.o(.init.text+0x38c): In function
`unreachable_devices':
mmconfig.c: undefined reference to `pci_conf1_read'
make[2]: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
It happens with current Linux from git when compiled for i386.
Missing functions are in arch/i386/pci/direct.c, which is enabled by
selecting "Direct" or "Any" as PCI access mode.
I believe the most straight fix would be to move shared functions to a
separate file (e.g. conf1.c) under arch/i386/pci/ that would be compiled
if either CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG or CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT is set.
