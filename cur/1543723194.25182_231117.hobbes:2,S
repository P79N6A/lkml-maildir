Hi Paul, 
Can you please apply the following patch to the ameslab ppc64
tree, and/or roll it upwards to the marclello 2.6 tree?  
This path is 100% pure cleanup; no functional changes.
I got irritated when I was given a -1 that was cast to an unsigned
int that was then cast to a signed (64-bit) long, and so I received 
a value of 4 billion instead of -1.  This patch fixes this insanity.
Different files were treating this return code as being signed 
or unsigned, 32-bit or 64-bit.  The 'real' return code is always 
a signed 32-bit quantity, so this patch just makes the usage 
consistent across the board.
