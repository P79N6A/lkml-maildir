Quod Erat Demonstrandum.
Even people who can be assumed to have a clue can make the mistake of using 
sleep_on() in spite of the fact that it's almost impossible to use 
correctly.
It can be removed from 2.5 without much pain -- half the drivers are broken
anyway due to the removal of cli(). I'm running a kernel with sleep_on()
removed quite happily.
At Stephen's request, I'll wait a couple of days for ext3 to remove all use
of sleep_on() before submitting the patch. NFS wants fixing too, but other 
than that the breakage seems remarkably slight.
