Andrew,
I'm getting some (sort of) random NFS Auth errors with -mm2 and -mm3.  
Sometimes the directories i export get exported read only, so i can't edit 
them on my nfs clients.  
When i'm running 2.5.65 from BK, the problem doesn't exist, its only when i 
switch to the -mm branch it manifests itself.  I was going to back out the 
nfs patches, and see if i could find the culprit....
thanks,
seth
