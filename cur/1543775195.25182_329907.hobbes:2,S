Pardon me if I haven't seen the whole thread.
Do you have hard drive write cache turned off or, if it's a raid card, a 
battery backup on the write cache?  That makes a big difference when

Again, no offense, just one of those "have you taken it out of the box, 
plugged it in and turned it on" kind of questions.
