Out of the serial layer too. While the serial layer does stuff like call
line discipline functions from the wrong context and sick hacks like
calling functions out of tty layer workqueues its also involved.
Right now calls into the ldisc side are all sane (there are two corner
cases left that need the other side fixing). The calls into serial
driver side is still pending repair and also needs the flip buffers
fixing first.

I'm working on it. It would be helpful if the drivers/serial code would
use helpers and not dig in places it shouldnt so that the transition can
be cleaner.
Something like this for 8250.c - it fixes the sick hacks calling into
tty
workqueues, the deadlock on overrun and cleans up flip buffer whacking
to use the helper. The helpers handle the overrun case internally so
that cleans up some code, they also happen to be API's I think I can
preserve when updating while direct buffer whacking is probably a nono.
In general tty driver hacking folks should expect
- direct flip buffer poking to break
- flip buffer length checking to break (DMA cards and virtualised
machines want
  variable sized buffers)
so if they can move towards tty_insert_flip_char() they'll make life
easier down the line. I'll try and push a few more "fake" helpers as I
try and get the dynamic flip buffers into shape.
