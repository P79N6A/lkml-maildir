Looks like we're missing a "|" after the second %9u above .. You could
add that as long as your modifying this area.. Also your tabbing is a
little too heavy ..
I wonder if you think the change to saving the caller EIP is better than
saving the file name? The size saving in the likeliness struct is nice,
but since this is for debugging is not at all required ..
Overall it looks like a nice update/cleanup ..
