i've measured it and it takes a few milliseconds typically - certainly 
not noticeable even for hypothetical highly scripted CPU-hotplug 
environments. (i doubt they really exist in practice)
in fact (new) kprobes uses the freezer, and it's far more performance 
sensitive than the handling of CPU hotplug events.
And there was almost no effort put into making the freezer fast, i'm 
sure if it ever becomes a problem we could improve it quite drastically. 
And that effort would improve suspend performance and kprobes 
performance as well - while the cpu-hotplug locking hell is just an 
unneeded distraction nobody really can deal with properly. So i say lets 
ditch CPU hotplug locking completely and lets go for the dead-simple 
freezer based design ...
