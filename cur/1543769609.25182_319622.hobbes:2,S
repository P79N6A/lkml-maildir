Hi all,
well, I'm just trying to listen to my music, however, it's either a no-go 
(using ALSA-OSS emulation) or just a plain pain to listen to (via ALSA 
directly).
In first case, I just hear nothing. A `dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/dsp` stops 
at a certain byte and in my headset I hear a very high beep tone.
in second case, the music seems very deformed and the output is very buggy at 
all (meaning, that it played just for a few minutes).
deformed means, that the foreground singer has been somewhat in the very 
background and it overall has been very unfunny to listen to.
I was trying different players and versions anyway.
So, is this supposed to be a bug in the kernel sound driver for my certain 
hardware?
nforce4 TYAN dual-opteron board (the whole system 64bit compiled, kernel: 
2.6.11-r8)
