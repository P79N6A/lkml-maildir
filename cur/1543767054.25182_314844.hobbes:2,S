Thanks for kind help. 
I know printk can do this job. But what I really want is to print logs
to a file specified by me instead of /var/log/messages. And, the
messages irrelevant to my module should not be written into that file.
 Now my log mixed with other logs in /var/log/message, which bother me
much. :(
I guess the KERN_PRIVATE might work for this. Can you give me more details?
Thanks again!
