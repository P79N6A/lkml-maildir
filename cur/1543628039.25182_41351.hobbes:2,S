there is some email exchange with Jesse Barnes from SGI on the LSE and
linux-ia64 mailing lists.
  Date: 1.-5. March, 2002
  Subject: Re: [Linux-ia64] O(1) scheduler K3+ for IA64
The success report was a personal email.
On LSE and linux-kernel there were some emails related to the node affine
scheduler which contains the same migration mechanism (but a different
load balancer):
  Date: 13. March and later
  Subject: Node affine NUMA scheduler
Besides, Matt Dobson from IBM adapted the node affine scheduler to work
on NUMA-Q and tested it quite a bit, that email exchange was direct, too.
The testing on our side wasn't publicized, either, but our production
kernel for AzusA (which contains these patches) is about to be sent out to
customers and has undergone quite some testing.
It's a pity that there's so much duplicated effort in the Linux community,
but that's how it goes, you probably know it better than I do.
Best regards,
Erich
