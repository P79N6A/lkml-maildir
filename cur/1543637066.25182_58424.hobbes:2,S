I don't know what code you are looking at because EVMS does
not suck in any code from existing fs utilities.  We only have enough
code to invoke the EXISTING utilities.  The only code we have is
simple things like version checks, superblock probes, and size
constraints.  For example, unlike  libparted which re-implements
resize of ext2 volumes, EVMS invokes the existing resize2fs.
In fact, all FSIMs have been developed in collaboration with the
filesystem owners, and in the case of JFS and EXT2/3 the FS
utility owners actually wrote the FSIM!
Also, if it is so easy to link parted with LVM2 to get greater
functionality,
why hasn't the LVM team or Andrew done this yet?  We went down this
road and found it was a dead end.
