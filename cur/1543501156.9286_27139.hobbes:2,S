It's a problem that can occur both under NFSv3 and stock 2.2.10 (since
it just means that the RPC layer is blocked for some reason).
I have recently been trying to hack up the RPC layer under the NFSv3
patches. The main interest is getting the RPC over TCP to work
reliably, and to reduce the problems with the socket layers running
out of buffer memory (the latter is a problem when you have 32k
wsizes). This means that the last few batches of NFSv3 patches have
been a bit unstable (sorry) but should hopefully improve.
It would therefore be very helpful to me if you could give me some
more details about which version of the patches you're using.  Note
that version 0.9.9.2 did have a bug which could give symptoms like the
ones you're seeing. I put out 0.9.10 last evening in order to fix it.
Cheers,
  Trond
