You can also get rid of any polling in the driver ISR. This is used
for "interrupt mitigation" and has the bad effects that you describe.
Instead of:
           while(some_bits_are_set)
                service_those_bits();
           return;
Modify to:
	if(some_bits_are_set)
              service_those_bits();
        return;
This will allow other stuff to happen before the ISR gets called
again. Yes, you lose packets when stormed, but so-what? For normal
communication, the NIC runs fine, maybe a few percent loss in
performance.
FYI, every driver that I have used that suffers 'lock-up' like
the eepro100, 3c59x, etc., can be permanently fixed by removing the
poll. Something to think about.
Cheers,
