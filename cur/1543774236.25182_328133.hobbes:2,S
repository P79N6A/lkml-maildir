OK, I understand why this one might worth different

This is only true if the words themselves have no meaning or utility.
They do.

This is not true, a developer working on a new board support package
cares whether we're in the decompress step or in the kernel booting step.
New developers unfamiliar with the kernel booting sequence will have
to find out where this message is coming from, when things fail.
Without a unique string to search for, this becomes quite difficult
to find.
In my field, I work with a LOT of developers who are not deeply
familiar with the kernel, but still face these bootup messages.

I'm not sure what happens on gunzip failure, but
I see kernel boot failures quite often during
board bringup, and it's nice to know if you've
passed the decompression phase, etc.  The messages
you propose are much less instructive for the
developer.
However, I will grant that we're not trying to
optimize for the developer, but rather should
be optimizing for the user.  But if we can
do something that is suitable to both, I would
prefer it.  Could we put just a little more
wording back in?
