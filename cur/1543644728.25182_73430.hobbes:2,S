Hi. I got a Y-251U USB drive enclosure this morning, as at
http://www.cable-world.com/newproduct/USB10HDD.htm
Doesn't appear to work with Linux by default, but it's based on the
GL241USB chip and a Compact Flash reader based on that works,

So, altering it slightly I get the attached patch, which works for me.
