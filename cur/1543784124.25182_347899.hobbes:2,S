Hi,
>> That would be because the kernel is written in *C* (and some asm),
*not* C++.
I cannot see the connection. At the end everything gets converted
to assembler/opcode. In the user space I can mix C and C++ code
without any problems, why should this not be possible in the
kernel mode?
>> There /is/ no C++ support.
This will be a problem in future. Nearly nobody will start a new
larger project (driver, user space software, embedded firmware)
using non OO languages today. So porting eg. Windows drivers to
Linux is nearly impossible without C++ support.
E.g. in my case the Windows source code has got more than 10 MB.
Nobody will convert such an amount of code from C++ to C.
This would take years.

Right.
