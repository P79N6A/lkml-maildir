Woops, it had a bug (I overlooked the usage of __add_wait_queue in sleep_on),
the bug was reproduced and fixed by Chris Mason and his fix is obviously right,
see:

New patch (revision n.4) against vanilla 2.2.19pre3 is here:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.19pre3/wake-one-4
Since 2.2.19pre3aa[123] included the wake-one-3 patch they can generate task in
D state blocked in sleep_on* too. So if you're running 2.2.19pre3aa[123] you
should either upgrade to 2.2.19pre3aa4 or to apply the above inlined one liner
on top of 2.2.19pre3aa[123] sources and recompile (just make bzImage again will
be enough).
