It's new hotplug scripts. Put modules you do not want to be automatically
loaded even if they think they have hardware/facilities to bind to into
/etc/hotplug/blacklist
I, for example, have evbug, joydev, tsdev and eth1394 there.
Greg, any chance adding evbug to the default version of hotplug package?
