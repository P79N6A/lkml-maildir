What would you prefer? Letting them continue to use RDTSC
which is less and less an usable cycle count?  Telling the users
it's a bad idea without offering a credible alternative
for cycle counting? 
And if they break it the kernel can always trap it, so there's
at least a safety net.
One alternative would be to make a function in the vsyscall page, but
that would add at least an indirect function call which can be quite
slow and I can just hear people complaining about that.
Also there are only two slots in the vsyscall page left right now and I
already planned them for other things (although it would be possible to go 
for a full vDSO, just a lot of overhead)
