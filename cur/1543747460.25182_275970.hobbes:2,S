   In an email conversation with Alan Cox and Andrew Morton I was
asked if OSDL could create a repository for old non-NDA manuals.
   I agreed that this sort of old copyrighted but never to be reprinted
documentation needs a home and even thought some said it was
a monster it looked like a nice little bunny to me so .....
   I've setup a little web site and have a file cabinet all ready to go.
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/opendoc/index.html
   I also decided that as long as I had to keep a list of hard copy
documentation in the drawer I might as well add links to 
companies providing  documentation and links to any
groups or standards.  So if you have favorite links or your
company provides developer information for open source
folks please send the link information  to opendoc@lists.osdl.org.
  If you have an old non-NDA manual for something that you
aren't the maintainer and no longer want the responsibility
of keeping coffee or pet stains off of it.  Then please follow 
the instructions under "Submitting Hardcopy".
  As for any other comments I welcome them.  Not set on the
anything just trying to provide a service here.
Tim
