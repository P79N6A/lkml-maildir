The very last thing I see when booting ist:
   PCI: Probing PCI hardware (bus 0)
That's it.  But it seems to be a BIOS Proble - I just found out that the
Soekris-Home-Page states:
[...]
 The SC1100 has a bug where certain PCI config cycle conbinations can
 cause the processor to lock up. comBIOS version 1.21 or newer reprogram
 the chipset to fix the problem.
[...]
I'll try to upgrade my comBIOS this afternoon, and let you know if 2.6.x
boot's fine or not.
Regards
