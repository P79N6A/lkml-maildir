This seems excessive, it's already possible to set the preset lpj on the
kernel command line, and virtually every one of the embedded
architectures supports setting the kernel command line as a config
option. Is there any reason why you can't simply set it there as a
default instead? It's all going to be .config resident in the end
anyways.
