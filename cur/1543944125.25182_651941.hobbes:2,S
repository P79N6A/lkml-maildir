Sysfs does not support to create symbolic links to regular files now.
The sysfs_create_link() is a function to create a symbolic link on sysfs.
However, it requires two kobjects as its arguments. One is to specify its
parent directory, the other is to specify the target of indirection.
It means the indicated target have to be a directory.
At include/linux/sysfs.h:
int __must_check sysfs_create_link(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobject *target,
                                    const char *name);
Please tell me, if I have any misunderstandings.
Thanks,
