How would you be able to tell which disk contains the bad stripe?
RAID reconstruction relies on knowing which disk to reconstruct because
it's obviously bad - there's out of band information in the form
of I/O errors.  If you only have an incompletely updated stripe on
a disk, you don't know which data to reconstruct from parity.
I think the only way of doing this properly is to either have
battery-backed cache, or by having journalling at the RAID level.
