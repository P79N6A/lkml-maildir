Disabling those chip drivers isn't necessarily the answer, since they
can still be used in most cases; just not for JFFS2. Perhaps we should
just disable JFFS2 if BROKEN_UNALIGNED is set -- or disable JFFS2 on NOR
flash if it's set. 
Get the generic BROKEN_UNALIGNED thing done across all architectures
which need it, and we'll work out precisely where to use it.
