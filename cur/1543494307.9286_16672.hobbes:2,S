Have you also updated everything as per the Documentation/Changes
file? Below is the relevant section from the 2.2.7 version thereof,
and you should note that the versions listed are MINIMUM versions,
so if you have later versions of anything listed installed, do NOT
downgrade just because of this list...
 Q> Kernel modutils	    2.1.121	; `insmod -V`
 Q> Gnu C		    2.7.2.3	; `gcc --version`
 Q> Binutils		    2.8.1.0.23	; `ld -v`
 Q> Linux libc5 C Library   5.4.46	; `ls -l /lib/libc*`
 Q> Linux libc6 C Library   2.0.7pre6	; `ls -l /lib/libc*`
 Q> Dynamic Linker (ld.so)  1.9.9	; `ldd --version` or `ldd -v`
 Q> Linux C++ Library	    2.7.2.8	; `ls -l /usr/lib/libg++.so.*`
 Q> Procps		    1.2.9	; `ps --version`
 Q> Procinfo		    16		; `procinfo -v`
 Q> Psmisc		    17		; `pstree -V`
 Q> Net-tools		    1.50	; `hostname -V`
 Q> Loadlin		    1.6a
 Q> Sh-utils		    1.16	; `basename --v`
 Q> Autofs		    3.1.1	; `automount --version`
 Q> NFS			    2.2beta40	; `showmount --version`
 Q> Bash		    1.14.7	; `bash -version`
 Q> Ncpfs		    2.2.0	; `ncpmount -v`
 Q> Pcmcia-cs		    3.0.7	; `cardmgr -V`
 Q> PPP			    2.3.5	; `pppd --version`
 Q> Util-linux		    2.9i	; `chsh -v`
In each case, the text after the semicolon is the command that should
tell you the version of the relevant software that is installed.
Best wishes from Riley.
