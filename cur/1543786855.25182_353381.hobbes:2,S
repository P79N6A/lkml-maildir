Hi Andrew,
Thanks for your response.
In 2.4 series there were three different kind of task queues: Timer,
Scheduler and Immediate. It is said that "work queue" is basically the
old Scheduler type. Is there any way I can make it work the "Immediate"
way.
I have gone through many of the LINUX sample 2.6 drivers, but all these
have just replaced tqueue by work_queue and mark_bh(IMMEDIATE_BH) by
schedule_work, but they are not using their own queues. Is it because my
driver has a very heavy / time intensive bottom half function?
Ravi

Process context.

Yup.

Not really.  Bits 8-19 of preempt_count() count the IRQ depth and bits
0..7
count the inc_preempt_count() depth.  If CONFIG_PREEMPT is enabled,
spin_lock() does inc_preempt_count().  See the definitions of
hardirq_count(), softirq_count() and irq_count().

umm, look at the implementation of schedule_work()?
	if (!test_and_set_bit(0, &work->pending)) {
it's already pending (the scheduled work has not run yet).  You need to
design you schedule_work() caller to queue things up and you need to
design
your schedule_work() handler to consume all the thus-far-queued work
items.
Just ignore the return value of schedule_work().
