You said your Intel board has also problems with the handoff.
Could you try the follwing patch, because the EHCI documentation
says that the OS must set the EHCI_USBLEGSUP_OS bit and then
wait until EHCI_USBLEGSUP_BIOS is cleared. The kernel never
uses the EHCI_USBLEGSUP_OS flag at the moment.
On my system there is no change, but maybe this patch works on
your system.
Thanks
