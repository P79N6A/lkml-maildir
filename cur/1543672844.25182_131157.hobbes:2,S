I'm trying to get a feel for the maximum time from an interrupt coming in until 
the userspace handler gets notified.  On intel you can program the hardware to 
generate interupts through /dev/rtc.  The powerpc doesn't seem to support this.
Jiffies are not accurate enough, I am expecting max latencies in the 1-2 ms range.

Unfortunately no.  USB/Firewire/Ethernet on the desktop, ethernet/serial for 
compactPCI.
I want to find an additional programmable interrupt source.  It bites that cheap 
PCs have this, and the powerpc doesn't.
