Well, now it finds both the cards. :)
MOXA Smartio family driver version 1.2
Tty devices major number = 174, callout devices major number = 175
Found MOXA C104H/PCI series board(BusNo=0,DevNo=10)
Found MOXA C104H/PCI series board(BusNo=0,DevNo=11)
However, access to the second one still results in the oops. :-/
