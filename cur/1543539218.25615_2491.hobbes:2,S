Yes. I agree with having a mdacon driver is a good thing.

What I mean is having two drivers playing with the same hardware. I have
seen this with running vesafb and the native chipset fbdev driver on the
same card. It's a bad idea.

Great. Thanks for testing it. As for the S3 Virge I have seen a few people
attempt at making a Virge fbdev driver. Inquire on the fbdev list to see
who is involved in that. 
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
