      It should be controllable by /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory.
actually I tested this on a RH6.0 box ( kernel 2.2.5 )
and setting overcommit_memory changed nothing,
I'm still able to alloc about 2GB of VM ,and the when I begin to fill up 
more than ( RAM + SWAP) , then the system shows up these *BAD* symptoms.
Is this problem only present no 2.2.5 or on other kernels too ?

agreed.
      This is unix, I'm afraid. You are expected to kill offending tasks
      before memory starts going really low.
not possible in all cases ...

Benno
