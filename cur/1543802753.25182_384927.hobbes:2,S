It's not still being used (we have suspend2.net now). The only problem I see 
with that is that it still has all the old suspend2 stuff and Sourceforge 
make it really hard to clear out a project's files. You were talking about 
calling it uswsusp or something like that. How about starting a 
uswsusp.sf.net?

Nigel
