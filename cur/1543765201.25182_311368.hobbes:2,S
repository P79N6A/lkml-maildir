I have not seen the Fusyn code. Where is the before-any-lock priority
stored? Ingo's code sets the prio back to what is given by static_prio.
So, if Fusyn sets static_prio it will work as you say. It it will then be
up to Fusyn to restore static_prio to what it was before the first Fusyn
lock.

You basicly need 3 priorities:
1) Actual: task->prio
2) Base prio with no RT locks taken: task->static_prio
3) Base prio with no Fusyn locks taken: task->??
So no, you will not need the same API, at all :-) Fusyn manipulates
task->static_prio and only task->prio when no RT lock is taken. When the
first RT-lock is taken/released it manipulates task->prio only. A release
of a Fusyn will manipulate task->static_prio as well as task->prio.

Yes.
All these things assumes a clear lock nesting: Fusyns are on the outer
level, RT locks on the inner level. What happens if there is a bug in RT
locking code will be unclear. On the other hand errors in Fusyn locking
(user space) should not give problems in the kernel.

I think that it might be a fast track to get things done to have a double
PI-locking system, one for the kernel and one for userspace. But I think
it is is bad maintainance to have to maintain two seperate systems. The
best way ought to be to try to only have one PI system. The kernel is big
and confusing enough as it is!
