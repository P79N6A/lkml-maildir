Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/5] Shadow directories

Hello,
Let's say we have an archive file "hello.zip" with a hello world program source
code. We want to do this:
	cat hello.zip^/hello.c
	gcc hello.zip^/hello.c -o hello
	etc..
The '^' is an escape character and it tells the computer to treat the file as a directory.
[Note: We can't do "cat hello.zip/hello.c" because of 
http://lwn.net/Articles/100148/
 ]
The kernel patch implements only a redirection of the request to another directory
("shadow directory") where a FUSE server must be mounted. The decompression of 
archives is entirely  handled in the user space. More info can be found in the documentation
patch in the series.
The shadow directories are used in RheaVFS project [ 
http://rheavfs.sourceforge.net/
 ],
and it also can be used with the original AVFS [ 
http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/avfs/
 ].
The patches are against vanilla 2.6.23.
This is my first bigger contribution to the kernel so please be gentle ;-)
