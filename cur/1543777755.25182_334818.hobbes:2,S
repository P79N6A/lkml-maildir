Well, current -linus already has a patch from me to change the 
compression scheme that also fixes most of the signedness problems. The 
ones below escaped me because my gcc3.3.2 didn't complain about them 
even with all the -W[xxx] switches I could find.
This takes a big hunk out of previous patches I've seen, so that might 
explain the difference.
