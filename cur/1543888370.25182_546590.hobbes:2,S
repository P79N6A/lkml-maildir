Basically, LZO has much faster decompression speeds. For jffs2, there
was a 40% filesystem read speed improvement with LZO compared to zlib
and that resulted in a device booting 10% faster. The drawback was a
slight drop in file compression (say 5% although it varied a lot
depending on the test data). For lots of uses, that is an acceptable
compromise.
It appears resier4 is using LZO too.

Those figures sound comparable with my experiences...
