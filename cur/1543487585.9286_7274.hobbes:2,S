Hi,
 I'm using autofs here to mount a disk partition, a ZIP ATAPI drive, a
CDROM, a toaster (well, CD burner) and a floppy. Everything's OK, apart
that I cannot mount any of these peripherals read-write.
 The only way I've found to do it so far is chmod 1777
/autofs/mount/point and adding the option umask=0 to the appropriate
keys. Dissatisfying, to say the least.
 I just imagine that autofs could implement this: when I type, say, cp
/a/file /autofs_mount_point/floppy as a user with uid 517, it automounts
the floppy with options uid=517 - and umask 77 if paranoid.
 I've tried to do it using ugly workarounds with executable maps
(greping through /proc/nnn, etc) but failed. And anyway it would be too
dirty - and insecure - a trick to use.
 What would need to be done (as far as my knowledge goes) is to catch
the task_struct of the aforementioned cp process, fetch its euid field
and fill mount with the appropriate option. 
 But how? What needs changing and where? Not that I want to submit a
patch (I'm not at ease enough with kernel programming) but I'd
appreciate any hint on how to achieve this - you get nothing if you
don't try :)
