Precisely.  And for futex, the correct meaning is "the user asked for
a shared mapping": a FUTEX_WAIT on a shared mapping of a file opened
read-only _should_ be woken by a FUTEX_WAKE on the same file by
another process.

remap_file_pages() returns -EINVAL on mappings of
read-only file handles because it tests VM_SHARED.  There is no good
reason not to remap a read-only file - it doesn't complain about
remapping a PROT_READ mapping of a writable file!
Patch tested and attached.

Subject: [PATCH] Allow remap_file_pages() on read-only files
Patch: nonlinear-mayshare-2.6.0-test4-02.2jl
This changes remap_file_pages() to work on mappings of read-only file
handles.  Without this it returns -EINVAL.
