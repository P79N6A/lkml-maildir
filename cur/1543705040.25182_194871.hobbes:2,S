Subject: [CRYPTO]: Miscompiling sha256.c by gcc 3.2.3 and arch pentium3,4

2.6.2-rc2 sha256.c is miscompiled with gcc 3.2.3.
(User space is RedHat 3ES.)
Just an observation:
gcc 3.2.3 is miscompiling sha256.c when using
-O2 -march=pentium3
or pentium4.
gcc 3.3.x is ok, or the problem disappears
if I use arch=i686 or reduce the optimisation level to -O2.
Sympthoms are all the sha256 test vectors fail.
If I extract the guts of the file to compile in user space
the same problem occurs.
