OK.  Is there any reason why IPv4 should be different from IPv6 in
this respect though?
If the split device dst's are to be kept, we'll need a way to clean
them up.  There are two choices:
1) Put the dst's on IPv6's own GC so that we can search by rt6i_idev.
2) Change the generic GC so that dst->ops->ifdown is always called even
if dst->dev does not match with the device going down.  We also need to
change the individual ifdown functions to check for ->dev.  The IPv6
ifdown function can then check for ->rt6i_idev as well.
What's your preference?
Cheers,
