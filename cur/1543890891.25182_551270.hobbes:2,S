Well, actually, I chose list_for_each_entry_safe() quite conscious of
the locking issues.  If I see list_XXX_safe() then I know that I need
to be suspicious when reviewing code -- the same way seeing "atomic_t"
makes me think "is there any reason to use atomic_t??"
If I just see
	for (pos = list_entry((head)->next, typeof(*pos), member),
		n = list_entry(pos->member.next, typeof(*pos), member);
	     &pos->member != (head);
	     pos = n, n = list_entry(n->member.next, typeof(*n), member))
then what am I to think?
 - R.
