Hi,
I have several servers and workstations. What optimization level in the
kernel configuration is the maximum possible if I want to use the same
kernel 
- on a Duron-650, a Celeron-1000, and a Celeron-2600?  (servers)
- additionally on a K6-3D 400 and a K6-2 350?
  (do I *have* to go down to CONFIG_M586 or does P2 or P-MMX work?)
- on a P3-700, an Athon XP 2400, and a P4-1800+? (workstations)
Thank you!
