I think you missed that Andrewas said he is worried about 64-bit overflows 
as well.  And you would not catch those with the sector != 
(sector_t)sector test because you would be comparing two 64-bit values 
together so they always match...
Hence why he shifts the value right by 32 bits then multiplies and tests 
the result for overflowing 32-bits which if it does it means it would 
overflow the 64-bit multiplication, too therefor your "sector" is 
truncated.
Makes sense to me in a some very convoluted sickening way...  (-;
