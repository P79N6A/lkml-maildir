Hi Arnd,
It seems your script is behaving wrongly for the VSYSCALL_BASE case 
(probably others too):
elf.h:
#define VSYSCALL_BASE   (__fix_to_virt(FIX_VSYSCALL))
#define VSYSCALL_EHDR   ((const struct elfhdr *) VSYSCALL_BASE)
#define VSYSCALL_ENTRY  ((unsigned long) &__kernel_vsyscall)
extern void __kernel_vsyscall;
