Linus,
Please pull the i2c subsystem updates for Linux 2.6.20 from:
git://jdelvare.pck.nerim.net/jdelvare-2.6 i2c-for-linus
These are late fixes that I want to have in 2.6.20, fixing compilation
breakage of the new i2c-pnx bus driver, and helping compatibility
with regards to planned i2c-core cleanups.
