The latency for interactive stuff is definitely more noticeable though, and
thus arguably more important. Perhaps we should be tying the scheduler in
more tightly with the VM - we've already decided there which apps are 
"interactive" and thus need low latency ... shouldn't we be giving a boost
to their RAM pages as well, and favour keeping those paged in over other
pages (whether other apps, or cache) logically? It's all latency still ...
