Something else may slow down raw IO. A buffer
that looks contiguous in the user space typically looks
quite splintered from the kernel's perspective. This
means that a buffer of 64 KB in the user space ends
up being a scatter gather list of 16 elements (assuming
PAGE_SIZE of 4KB) en route to the IDE or SCSI subsystem.
Now one SCSI adapter that I have examined must push each
scatter gather element through its firmware to the DMA 
engine which can only hold one element at a time. 
That takes time.
