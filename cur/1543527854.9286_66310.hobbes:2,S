The board is an Intel Etherexpress Pro 10/100, the driver is eepro100.c, 
CONFIG_EEXPRESS_PRO100=y was defined in /usr/src/linux/.config
when the kernel was compiled.
Here's what the kernel reports on startup..
eth1: OEM i82557/i82558 10/100 Ethernet at 0xe8e0, 00:90:27:3A:70:30, IRQ 14.
  Board assembly 697680-002, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
  General self-test: passed.
  Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
  Internal registers self-test: passed.
  ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x24c9f043).
  Receiver lock-up workaround activated.
Anything else?
Thanks again for your time.
