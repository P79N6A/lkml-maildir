Hi Serge,
(Thanks for looking at this. I appreciate the review!)

I assume you mean S_REVOKE_LOCK and not ->i_mutex, right?
The caller is supposed to block open(2) with chmod(2)/chattr(2) so while 
revoke is in progress, you can get references to the _revoked inode_, 
which is fine (operations on it will fail with EBADFS). The 
->i_revoke_wait bits are there to make sure that while we revoke, you 
can't get a _new reference_ to the inode until we're done.
