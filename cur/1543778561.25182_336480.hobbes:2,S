The patch looks OK to me although I have some concerns.
- The error in resume can't be handled properly.
  What should we do for the error of request_irq()?
- Adding this to all drivers seem too much.
  We just need to stop the irq processing until resume, so something
  like suspend_irq(irq, dev_id) and resume_irq(irq, dev_id) would be
  more uesful?
