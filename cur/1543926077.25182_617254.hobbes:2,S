I'd like to see this merged right away, so we can finalize the build
environment change in the .24 release rather than having two releases
with gradual changes.
Linus, I know it's late, but you really should consider to pull this
into .24 so we are done with it once and forever. The patchset is
straight forward and as far as I can tell Sam really worked out all
the corner cases and fixed the review comments so we can be pretty
sure that there is not hidden wreckage lurking round the corner.
Thanks,
