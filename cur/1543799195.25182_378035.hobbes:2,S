Actually, I wasn't talking about the buddy allocator, since it is probably
the best backend allocator to have.  I actually like it alot and it
doesn't seem to have a problem.
But the slab code has gotten more complex, and probably too feature full.
And I'm afraid that Christoph Lameter may be right, in that we could go to
another allocation scheme and after adding all the features that the slab
has, we would be just as complex.

That part I didn't agree with (replacing the buddy system I mean).

I'd still add slab there, but as I said above, anything else may become
too complex.  Although, playing with this Magazine thingy is starting to
look interesting!
