Instead of "major update" I think that "major new version of" sounds
more
attracting. Bit of exaggerating doesn't hurt...

"broad support for newer hardware" sounds at least better. And climaxes
don't hurt.

What about something in the sense of: "* Frist UNIX support for a wide 
range of advanced multimedia
features like video capture ..." and so on and so on... maybe tell
something
about "Video conferencing"  this seems one very catchy buzzword.

"Improved performance in highly throughput demanding applications and
on multiprocessor systems"
My main point here is that you should focus on the term "applications"
if talking about throughput!

No it should be something about: " full support for direct data
interchangability 
between Linux and NT systems!"

No no tell something about:
"It should be expected that the system integrators will incorporate
it as SOON AS POSSIBLE into ..."
The following should be placed first. Yes think about the clueless guy
who had
never seen Linux before...

This they will not care about at least or maybe even worser will not
agree with in first place. "native to" isn't "politically correct"

This seems OK.
