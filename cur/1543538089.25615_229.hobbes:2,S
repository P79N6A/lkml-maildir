I understand that.  I don't understand ignoring the answers.

?? everything _I_ read said that is stupidity for a GP OS (Linux).  'if
there is really some sense that it should be solved' you say??  Well,
come on.. the volume of traffic in this thread combined with some of the
persons (who didn't mumble) when they responded make that quite clear.

I've played with enough of Ingo's work to not doubt the functionality ;-)
Despute?  I haven't heard a designer with a dispute on the issue.. it
seems very cut and dried from my viewpoint.  We got a problem.. it's in
deep think.  You want an answer _now_, have one, but not one which is
acceptable to designers.  Too bad.. end of story until someone thinks
harder.  (Ingo indicated he's thinking about it.. powerful medicine)

I think [1] stated my viewpoint well enough. BTW, the quote fron Larry
that you snipped was the more interesting portion of my (off-line) input.
