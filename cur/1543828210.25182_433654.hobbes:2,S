It is a long story,
In fact, when using ext2 instead, I am hitting a second kernel bug or a PXE 
bug (Alan Cox supposition) that I cannot narrow down to something simple.
For a description of the problem see Rick Warner's email (1), he had the very 
same problem (and also probably failed to narrow it down to something easy to 
reproduce) in the past see:
(1) 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/28/145
When removing ext2/ext3 from the way, the bug referenced in (1) disappears but 
I need to export the ramdrive data via NFS, hence it excludes tmpfs... But 
now reiserfs don't wan't to mount :-((((((
Since the second bug is very easy to reproduce, I prefered to report this one. 
I am still trying to reduce the original bug to something easy to reproduce 
but it is a lot of work.
Regarding my initial bug report,:
I just manage to reproduce it(the one I am reporting in the previous email) on 
an AMD64/Debian Sarge running 2.6.8. 
I will appreciate any help.
