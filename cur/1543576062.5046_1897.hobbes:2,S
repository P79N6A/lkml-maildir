Thanks, I think you found the big problem with test12.

It's a bug.
Ho humm. I'll have to check what the proper fix is. Right now the rule is
that nobody can _ever_ remove himself from a task queue, although there is
one bad user that does exactly that, and that means that it should be ok
to just cache the "next" pointer in run_task_queue(), and make it look
something like
	static void run_task_queue(task_queue *list)
	{
		if (!list_empty(list)) {
			unsigned long flags;
			struct list_head *next;
			spin_lock_irqsave(&tqueue_lock, flags);
			next = list->next;
			while (next != list) {
				struct list_head *curr;
				void *arg;
				void (*f) (void *);  
				struct tq_struct *p;
				curr = next;
				next = next->next;
				list_del(curr);
				p = list_entry(curr, struct tq_struct, list);
				arg = p->data;
				f = p->routine;
				p->sync = 0;
				spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tqueue_lock, flags);
				if (f)
					f(arg);
				spin_lock_irq(&tqueue_lock);
			}
			spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tqueue_lock, flags);
		}
	}
				
which basically will never re-start at the head if a tq re-inserts iself
(side note: new entires are inserted at the end, but if it was already the
last entry then re-inserting it will not re-execute it, should this should
avoid your problem).
Does this fix the problem for you?
