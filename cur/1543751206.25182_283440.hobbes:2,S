Well unfortunately I think you underestimate the cost of the serial
eprom needed to do the load on an fpga or pld or the like.  According to
our suppliers they are actually rather hard to get for some reason (that
I don't understand) and are more than $0.50.  The product I am current
working on software for would be a whole lot simpler if we could just
program an eprom with the fpga code, but instead we have to load it via
jtag through the parallel port to save a fair bit of moeny on eprom
chips assuming we could even get them in the quantities we would need.
The winmodem is just a sound card with the cpu doing the actual
algorihtm.  That is different and would not be solved with an eprom,
only with a real DSP or other chip capable of doing the modulation and
demodulation of the signals.  I guess calling them modem's is being too
generous, more like phone line sampler cards.
