A diligent C programmer would write this as follows:
	void do_some_stuff (struct T * a, struct T * b);
versus
	void do_more_stuff (const struct T * a, const struct T * b);
So I don't see C++ winning at all here.

I think I'll call this my rule #1:
The moment you stop worrying about something is the moment it bites you
in the butt. :-) Much firsthand experience.

And if the caller is passing in something that's not meant to be
modified, then the modification causes much badness. Happens with both
languages, too.

As far as I know, nothing stops GCC from doing the exact same
optimizations in the function prototypes given above.
