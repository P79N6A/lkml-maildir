I don't know if this qualifies as "in the Enterprise environment to
support redundancy by any real-world networking company", but when I
worked at Deja.com (aka Dejanews), we used software RAID on production
servers (database hosts mostly) and it worked fine.  The only problems
we ever had with it were due to human error (running fsck on individual
drives in the arrays).
