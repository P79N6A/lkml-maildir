No, it doesn't scale quite like that. The autocorrelation property
says such bits are poorly distributed - the turbulence has an inherent
timescale at which things become hard to predict. Over short
timescales they become easier to predict. We can posit that we can
increase the measurement accuracy to a degree where we begin to see
some sort of underlying noise caused by Brownian motion and physical
processes of that sort, but then you'd have to sit down and model it
like this paper's done rather than just handwaving and saying 12 LSBs
of the TSC are real noise. 
But that's all irrelevant because the TSC resolution isn't really
improving our measurement accuracy anything like that much. Nothing
the processor can measure comes in faster than the FSB clock rate,
which is a fixed lock-step multiple of the processor clock, which is
generally a fixed lock-step multiple of a 33.3MHz crystal somewhere.
The disk's microcontrollers, if not taking a clock signal directly
from the motherboard, are likely in sympathetic synchrony with them,
and are even then likely divided down a bit. Framing requirements for
disk and bus protocols lower this further.

No, it's not that straightforward. And no, the current code doesn't
even address cache effects. Hell, it doesn't even know about
solid-state devices. Note that SHA will do just as good a job of
removing correlation as an FFT, the problem is overestimating the
input entropy.
I think the prudent approach here is to punt and declare disks
untrusted, especially in light of the headless server attack model
where we intentionally leak entropy. It's still possible to use this
data for /dev/urandom (which my patches allow).

Doable, and probably best done with a userspace app feeding /dev/random.
