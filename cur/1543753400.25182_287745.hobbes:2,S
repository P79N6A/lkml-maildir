Hm, why another input class?  We already have /sys/class/input, which we
get hotplug events for.  We also have the individual input device
hotplug events, which is what I think we really want here, right?
Hm, in looking at the code some more, I think just adding a struct
device to the struct input_device would work.  You will have to refactor
out the fact that there is a pointer to a struct device in there (that
will just become the parent pointer to the input_dev's struct device).
If you do that, you can also drop a few of the fields in struct
input_dev.
That would solve all of the userspace issues your patch causes (hotplug
events would come out with the same type as before) and finally the
input subsystem would be part of the driver model properly :)
But yes, it will take more work than your patch, sorry.
thanks,
