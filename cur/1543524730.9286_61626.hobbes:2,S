    The init order is currently controlled by the order that they appear in
hosts.c, and not by the link order.
    I was kind of thinking that a better way of doing this is to use a
special ELF section that contains the initializer.  Then hosts.c would just
walk the list until it got to whatever was the end - in this case, the link
order would become quite critical.
