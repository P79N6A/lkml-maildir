ok I'll try that; I'm also trying some other cleanups
(right now we pick "ebp" and the stack pointer at different levels
in the call chain, so it gets a tad messy)

that's... a ton more tricky, and realistically needs the patch
to make show_stack take a level argument in the first place.
(I have that done, it's just touching like 125+ files, so
I shelved it as "probably not important enough");
