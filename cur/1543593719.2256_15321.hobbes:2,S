OK, riddle me this.  If this test is a crummy test, just how is it
that I was able to warn Rik in advance that when 2.4.5 was released,
he should expect complaints?  How did I _know_ that?  The answer is
that I fiddle with Rik's code a lot, and I test with this test because
it tells me a lot.  It may not tell you anything, but it does me.
