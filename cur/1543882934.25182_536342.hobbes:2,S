It does not set one explicitly and the docs suggest the default is
32bit. Adding an explicit "pci_set_dma_mask(dev->pci, DMA_24BIT_MASK)"
does not seem to make a difference. Mind you, the driver builds its own
S-G DMA table in saa7146_vmalloc_build_pgtable() and i'm not certain
whether this might bypass this setting.
