Of course this doesn't work if, like /tmp and /var/tmp are shipped as on 
every distribution, the directory has permissions 1777.

What problem you are trying to solve?  Why does it matter what the 
ownership of the symlink is?

Reading the page, the considerations about hard links seem quite off the 
mark.  If somebody creates a hard link to one of your files, it *is* the 
same file, just with a different name.  So it becomes the same problem 
as the first one.
That is, if I understand what you're saying correctly.  It's not very 
clear.  You should at least describe your envisioned scenario in a step 
by step basis, highlighting your concerns.
But frankly, see the FAQ answer to "I have discovered a huge security 
hole in rm!"
