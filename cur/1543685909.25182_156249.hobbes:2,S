This should be fixed by a "[PATCH] disk geometry/capacity cleanups".
drive->cyl won't be recalculated et all and cyls number from a disk itself
will be used for set_geometry().

It still may be a good thing, cause we never fall-back to CHS addressing,
even for taskfile ioctl requests (or fix taskfile and allow fall-back?).
