Sparse warnings are certainly going in the right direction.  The
sparse outputs for the last 2.6.8-rc* builds (allmodconfig builds)
can be viewed at...

Between rc1 and rc2:
  99 new warnings
  2181 fixed warnings

Between rc2 and rc3:

Between rc1 and rc3 (summary of the previous diffs)
  43 new warnings

At the risk of enhancing my reputation as "cron cherry", I'll go ahead 
and automate these builds (nightly on linus' tree) and inform the list
when there are any regressions in sparse and compiler warnings.  Stay 
tuned.
