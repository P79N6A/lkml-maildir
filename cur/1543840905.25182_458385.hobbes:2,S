So this patchset is largely orthogonal to the presently-queued stuff?

That would be good, thanks.  We were seriously considering merging all the
SRCU stuff for 2.6.18, because
cpufreq-make-the-transition_notifier-chain-use-srcu.patch fixes a cpufreq
down()-in-irq-disabled warning at suspend time.
But that's a lot of new stuff just to fix a warning about something which
won't actually cause any misbehaviour.  We could just as well do
	if (irqs_disabled())
		down_read_trylock(...);	/* suspend */
	else
		down_read(...);
in cpufreq to temporarily shut the thing up.
