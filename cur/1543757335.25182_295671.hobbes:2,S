Yes.

You have to start to think like a vendor with a long legacy. Then my
spec draft will make more sense. Basically, you can't tell a vendor
that his hardware is broken or he will ignore your efforts from that
point on. "It's a question of honour." If, on the other hand, a
vendor can claim his products are conforming to the spec by issuing
a software update for broken hardware, it is much more likely that
the spec gets accepted.

That would make some products non-conformant which are working
perfectly today. If the video state is preserved over S3, it doesn't
make sense to declare that behaviour non-conformant.

Not necessarily. Some BIOSes stay in graphics mode during the whole
bootup (at least it seems so) and would have to include additional
code to enter 80x25 text mode.
