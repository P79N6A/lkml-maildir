Subject: [GIT PULL] kill i386 and x86_64 directories

Hi Linus.
This patch serie kill the old i386 and x86_64 directories.
Introducing a few trivial changes in top-level Makefile
and kconfig Makefile allows us to move all files to
arch/x86/ where they belong.
Kay Sievers hit a bug in the first patch-set - this is now fixed and
the updated patch set is uploaded to my x86.git tree.
Build tested on both i386 and x86_64.
I test builded a few other archs just to check that I did not break them.
Shortlog:

      x86: unification of i386 and x86_64 Kconfig.debug

      kconfig: small code refactoring in kconfig Makefile
      x86: move i386 and x86_64 Kconfig files to x86 directory

A nice patch serie that deletes more lines than it adds.
Under normal circumstances I would not send this to you after the
merge window but this serie give a good hint to the casual
reader that something changed now the directories are gone.
So they do not ask - why are so many files missing. Now they
will hunt for the new location.

I did not amend the serie to add his acked-by - but just kept it in this mail.
