I'm not going to join the amateur lawyers' society debate about this. But I 
will point out that I disagree with your intentions here.
Personally, I don't _want_ authors or users of binary modules to be reassured.
I want them to write open source code, or go away. And I don't think I'm 
alone in that.
I think Linus said it best...

Large companies are now basing their design and purchasing choices on the
availability of _real_ Linux support; not just binary-only drivers. Even if 
we _are_ primarily motivated by the desire to increase the market share of 
Linux (which is something I don't concede anyway), then we still don't lose 
much by letting binary-module people continue to sweat.
