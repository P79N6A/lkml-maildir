Hello, i have hp compaq nx9020 with Display controller: Intel Corp. 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02), im trying run console with framebuffer -> intelfb, in kernel 2.6.11, and vga=792, all work ok, just cursor is not visible. In all kernel > 2.6.11, vga=792, my laptop just booting, all should work, but display is all the time blank, nothing is seen.
this is log from 2.6.11, where all work but cursor is not visible, in lilo vga=792, because append=intelfb... is impossible to use if laptop...
intelfb: 00:02.0: Intel(R) 852GM, aperture size 128MB, stolen memory 32636kB
intelfb: MTRR is disabled in the kernel
intelfb: Non-CRT device is enabled ( LVDS port ).  Disabling mode switching.
intelfb: Initial video mode is 1024x768-32@60.
intelfb: Changing the video mode is not supported.
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
with > 2.6.11, actually 2.6.13.2 laptop boot, but on display is nothing, just black .. better blank display i try to look at dmesg (by blind)
intelfb: Framebuffer driver for Intel(R) 830M/845G/852GM/855GM/865G/915G chipset

then same stuff like in 2.6.11 but dont work ;-/
In kernel i have compiled Graphic support -> * Support for the frame buffer devices -> * Intel 830/....
 Console display and driver support -> * Video mode selection support , * Framebuffer console support
 all this stuff compiled in kernel, not as module.
Any idea where can be problem ? why it doesnt work with new kernel, so its this drivers broken ? Thanks
