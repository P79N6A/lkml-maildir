Dave, I doubt you'll ever manage to do this if you're going to wait:
probably there will be always some new changes like this around...
IMHO, it would be nice to get the real state of current lockdep
problems here to figure out if there is any chance to do this right &
without any warnings with current lockdep. If I got it right from
earlier threads it might be impossible with USB, at least.
So, since I think these nesting levels seem to be wrong in 7/7 patch,
maybe it's better to exclude it from this patchset, and to try this as
testing for some time.
My proposal is to do the annotations with mutex_lock_nested(),
everywhere in this patch, according to 'real' relations between these
classes from thread POV, so e.g.:
mutex_lock_nested(&some_class->mutex, CLASS_PARENT);
mutex_lock_nested(&some_class->mutex, CLASS_CLASS);
...or more if needed:
mutex_lock_nested(&some_class->mutex, CLASS_CHILD);
mutex_lock_nested(&some_class->mutex, CLASS_ROOT);
...etc.
using adequate names for these enums, and only after this check what
lockdep thinks about it. Then, if there are no obvious mistakes, but
lockdep doesn't like it, send the patch and report without trying to
'silence' lockdep, so we could see what's going on, and if there are
any chances to make it right.
Thanks,
