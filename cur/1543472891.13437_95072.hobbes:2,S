I actually like your proposed alternative (Debian/GNU Linux). You've come
much closer regarding how GNU software fits into the picture.
But I do not think it's a bad thing for FSF/GNU to benefit from the
popularity of Linux. Linux is a great kernel in very many ways but its
widespread use has depended hugely on GNU software. We know this, but
someone reading an intro article in a Ziff-Davis mag or buying a CD
probably has no idea. And they should. On the positive side I have seen
some press attention lately reporting on other free software successes
such as sendmail and apache.
This broadening of awareness helps spread the realization that Linux is
not a fluke, that the methodology behind Linux is, and has been for some
time, at work producing other quality software. Without that, a lot of
people will write it off as a short-term trend. Most tech people I talk
with know next to nothing about Linux or other free software. Their
exposure via (MS-centric) trade press forms the whole of their knowledge.
Of course I try to inform them when I can. But if they think free software
means haphazard, then it's a much harder sell. Better that they know just
how many developers are out there putting in real time.

I have a problem with this too. I think Linux should have been endorsed by
GNU several years ago.

Please don't cross that line. By all means dispute what RMS is telling
people, if you disagree. But his right is to attempt to convince people of
his views. To question that is to question basic freedoms. If some people
blindly follow what he says, that's their fault. RMS doesn't have any
glamour to make people obey him. And I have heard of no threats or
extortions pending non-compliance. So if you don't buy the rhetoric, you
don't have to follow it.
