Hi Ted,
I'm currently integrating Lai's work to the 2.6.28 lttng branch (ascii
output !) :) and the next step will be to move to 2.6.29-rc1. I'll keep
you posted. Note that you can just leave the 
#New revamped userspace markers
markers-userspace.patch
markers-userspace-x86.patch
markers-userspace-x86_64.patch
sparc64-support-userspace-tracing.patch
Out of the patchset and it should not hurt the kernel tracing part at
all. Note that these 4 patches are planned to be heavily reworked before
lkml submission.
