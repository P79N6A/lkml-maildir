will it be the same behavior If thread A and thread B both have a lot of
printf? Suppose A get first run, does B get run at all?

Yes, FIFO threads that spin will block lower priority threads forever.
Sure, guaranteed if the high prio SCHED_FIFO task doesn't block at all.  If
you have a pure cpu burner, it will starve all lower priority
threads.
