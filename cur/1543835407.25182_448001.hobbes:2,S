I think it's interesting enough so that it's worth figuring how this 
would work with or replace the various interfaces you mentioned. I'm 
sure another discussion would take place at that point, before writing code.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
