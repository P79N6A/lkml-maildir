If it has roughly the same cost as Manfred's copy_user thing, it is
therefore roughly equivalent.
If this map_mm_kiobuf() thing would cost more (I think it would
because it would be using kiobufs when for this case there is
absolutely no need for them) then why?  "It's a clean interface
everyone can use" is not an acceptable answer when the clean interface
costs significantly more than the straightforward approach.
