I always interpreted the arch/arm directories to be "machines based on 
the s3cxxxx", etc.  Thus, in my world there's no dichotomy.  But hey, 
that's just one person's world.  :)

It doesn't stress GNU Arch, and I bet it doesn't stress SVN or Cogito.  
What it does do is make the kernel code appear more obvious and better 
organized, which I see as being a good thing for future 
maintainability's sake alone.  So I'm all for these changes.

Well, now's our chance to find out whose VC systems we break.  :)  And I 
don't see the "moving patches forward from older kernels" as being an 
argument for locking down the current/future state of the kernel sources.
