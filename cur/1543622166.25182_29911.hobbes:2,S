Apparently, that's where you're wrong... I tried removing some
modules, until I found the one causing the trouble:
	snd-card-intel8x0
... :(
I guess it's time to check for newer version on that... :/
On another question, is there a way to find out a hardware config -
I can't switch off all individual devices in the notebook, but if I
use the prism2 driver from linux-wlan.com, I can't get the full
performance out of it - but just something like ~20kb/s throughput
in ftp  (Win2K gets more than 500kb/s)...
Some people on the linux-wlan mailing list suggested, it might be a
hardware conflict, but they couldn't give me a better idea on HOW
to locate it...
Any clue, how I could go about that?
