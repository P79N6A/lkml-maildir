Doesn't matter; x is a loop index incrementing from 0 in this case.
Actually (correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't:
for(int i = 0; i < TIMEOUT > 0; i++)
translate to:
for(int i = 1; i < TIMEOUT; i++)
rather than:
for(int i = 0; i < TIMEOUT; i++)?
I hav not looked at the actual context of the code, but at least 
mathematically that makes more sense to me. i should never be 0 in the 
body of the loop, methinks?
Thanks,
Rahul
