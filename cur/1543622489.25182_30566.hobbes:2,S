This isn't very near on my TODO list though, I've got
the following big items coming up shortly:
rmap 13:   O(1) page_launder    <- working on it now
rmap 14:   pte-highmem support
In addition to this I'm merging some small pieces of code
with both Linus and Marcelo.
Making the locking more scaleable wrt. the pagemap_lru_lock
could be either a simple change or a rework of the way the
VM does locking. I'm not sure which way to go...
regards,
Rik
