The purpose of the patch is to overmount ramfs/rootfs with tmpfs before
the compressed cpio archive is unpacked and /init is run.
If there's no compressed cpio archive there's no need to overmount
with tmpfs, because we're not doing initramfs.
That's my understanding of it.

Even as it is I find it useful.
But, it's only needed because the current initramfs implementation doesn't
offer tmpfs as an option.
If you had the option of using tmpfs as the initramfs you wouldn't need
to do pivot-root or mount-move etc., because you would already be where
you wanted.
/init could just be a symbolic link to /sbin/init, or it could be
some other executable (shell script etc.), but there would be no need
to pivot or move root.
