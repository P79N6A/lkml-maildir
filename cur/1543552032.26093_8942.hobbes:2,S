The JVM is simply running the appropriate native code for bytecodes that
represents the java.net.DatagramSocket(int port, InetAddress laddr)
constructor.  Documentation for this constructor reads "Creates a
datagram socket, bound to the specified local address."  What do you
expect the JVM to will do?  It trys to bind() to the supplied address
and port.  There are no bugs here.  java.net.DatagramSocket is just
trying to emulate the expected Sockets interface behavior.  The Sun JVM
compatibility test suite appropriately includes some test to ensure that
error conditions are handled correctly.  Supplying a non-local IP
address to bind() is an error condition.  Hence, the JVM fails
compatibility on Linux 2.4.
