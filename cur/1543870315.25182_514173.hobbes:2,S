Well it is meant to be tuned to the cpu type in per_cpu_gain. So it should be 
easy to be set to the appropriate scaling. It was never meant to be a one 
value fits all as the processors changed.

Yes even I've commented before that this current system is unworkable come 
multiple shared power threads. This I do see as a real problem with it - in 
the future.

And that's the depressing part because of course I was interested in that as 
the original approach to the problem (and it was a big problem). When I spoke 
to Intel and AMD (of course to date no SMT AMD chip exists) at kernel summit 
they said it was too hard to implement hardware priorities well. Which is 
real odd since IBM have already done it with Power...
Still I think it has been working fine in software till now, but now it has to 
deal with the added confusion of dynticks, so I already know what will happen 
to it.
Hrm it's been a good time for my code all round... I think I'll just swap 
prefetch myself up the staircase to some pluggable scheduler that would 
hyperthread me to sleep as an idle priority task.
