FWIW, I do sparse runs on the fedora development kernels as part of
our daily builds now, and of the latest ones at
http://people.redhat.com/davej/kernels/Fedora/fc7/warnings.txt
(concatenated warning logs from i586/i686/x86_64/ppc/ppc64/s390 builds)
that 'expensive pointer subtraction' turns up 3705 times.
Interestingly, 1873 of those instances are from include/linux/mm.h
on the x86-64 build.
It's complaining about this line...
static __always_inline void *lowmem_page_address(struct page *page)
{
        return __va(page_to_pfn(page) << PAGE_SHIFT);
}
...
unsigned long page_to_pfn(struct page *page)
{
        return __page_to_pfn(page);
}
...
#define __page_to_pfn(page)     ((unsigned long)((page) - mem_map) + \
                                 ARCH_PFN_OFFSET)
looks like the other two variants of __page_to_pfn also use similar arithmatic.
