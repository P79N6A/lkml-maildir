Are you sure you don't scan your computer : the freebox v1 don't have
router mode and act like a bridge.
It seem suspicious that all the port are closed instead of filtered.
On the freebox v3 it is difficult to use nmap for guessing the os : in
router mode all the port are filtered except those you forward to your
computer.
