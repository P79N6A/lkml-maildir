Hi,
I am trying to port bus_to_virt and virt_to_bus to the
DMA-mapping scheme.
I found a way to move virt_to_bus() as follows:
page = virt_to_page(cmd->request_buffer);
offset = (unsigned long)address & ~PAGE_MASK;
dma_addr_t addr = pci_map_page(dev, page, offset,
size,direction);
But now I want to get virtual address for dma_addr_t.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
with regards,
  Anil
