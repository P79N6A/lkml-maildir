For reference, I just did the following:
 Q> # cd ~
 Q> # pwd
 Q> /home/rhw
 Q> # rm -fr linux linux-2.2.11 kernel
 Q> # ln -s /nfs/sunsite/Mirrors/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel .
 Q> # tar xzvf kernel/v2.2/linux-2.2.11.tar.gz
 Q>	:
 Q> # mv linux linux-2.2.11
 Q> # make menuconfig
 Q>	:
 Q> # make dep clean
 Q>	:
 Q> # make bzImage 2>&1 | tee stderr

The SunSITE mirror that is NFS mounted at /nfs/sunsite is SunSITE UK
at 193.63.255.4 for the reference of those interested.
As you can clearly see, the compile was from a FRESH kernel, straight
out of the tarball, and exactly as mirrored on the SunSITE UK mirror
direct from ftp.kernel.org for anybody to check.
Since the error still occurs with the above, I can safely state that
your explanation is wrong...
Best wishes from Riley.
