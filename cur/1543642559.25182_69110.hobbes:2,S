Fair enough, if you don't have the time to devote to it, it's best to replace the drive.
I assumed from the size of this thread, which has nothing to do with the kernel anymore, that we were trying to find out what was to blame.
If this is going to become a flamewar, please remove the cc: to the kernel list, as I doubt that it interests them.

Whatever - it was a joke.
The reason I brought up backups, was because even if you have a RAID array, of high quality drives, with non-sequential serial numbers, on hot-pluggable interfaces, with known good firmware, you can still get silent data corruption.
Fact - *NO* SLED, or RAID array, can ever be guaranteed never to silently flip a bit.

And the chances are you will get another drive of the same model, back from IBM.  How does that help?
I already pointed out that there are two known issues here with these drive - firmware bugs, and media defects.
So far, all we can say is that the firmware problem is now fixed.  On a replacement drive, you can't even say that.
The 'media errors' could have been caused entirely by the buggy firmware.

No, but you've upgraded the firmware, right?  If that has fixed the problem, then it is not a faulty drive.  If it is not a faulty drive, then what is the point in sending it back?  If it is not a faulty drive, IBM would be justified in sending it right back to you at your expense.  Oh, and it might get damaged in transit.

No, I would say it is very possible that you could receive a disk with the old firmware on it.  So, you'll just plug in your 'new' disk, and in a few months, bad sectors will start appearing.
