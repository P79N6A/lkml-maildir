Indeed the swsusp in -ac seems to oops a lot.  I hand patched
swsusp v0.8 to work with 2.4.19pre6 and get better behavior.
The docs (config help for swsusp) imply you don't need APM.
However turning APM entirely off results in compile errors
in swsusp.c.
Turning APM mostly off, results in swsusp reporting that it
can't stop kapmd.
