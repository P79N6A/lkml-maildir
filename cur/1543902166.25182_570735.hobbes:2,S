Hi,
I have a compile failure. git-bisect tells me:
81cda6626178cd55297831296ba8ecedbfd8b52d is first bad commit
commit 81cda6626178cd55297831296ba8ecedbfd8b52d
Author: Christoph Lameter <clameter@sgi.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 17 04:03:29 2007 -0700
    Slab allocators: Cleanup zeroing allocations
    It becomes now easy to support the zeroing allocs with generic inline
    functions in slab.h.  Provide inline definitions to allow the continued use of
    kzalloc, kmem_cache_zalloc etc but remove other definitions of zeroing
    functions from the slab allocators and util.c.
