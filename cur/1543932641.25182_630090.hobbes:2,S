If mapping is NULL, then try_to_free_buffers won't call cancel_dirty_page,
I think?
I don't know whether ext3 can be changed to not require/allow these dirty
pages, but I would rather Linus's dirty page accounting fix to go into that
path (the /* can this still happen? */ in try_to_free_buffers()), if possible.
Then you could also have a WARN_ON in __remove_from_page_cache().
