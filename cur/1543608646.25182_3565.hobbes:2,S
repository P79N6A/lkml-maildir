2.4.13. In my bootscript messages I see
* Configuring loopback: 127.0.0.1
* Attempting to configure eth0 by contacting a DHCP server...
dhcpcd: your IP address = 172.16.42.84
* Configuring eth1: 172.16.241.2
- ifconfig eth1
task `ifconfig' exit_signal 17 in reparent_to_init   <-----
Dunno is it normal or what, thought somebody will find this info useful...
eth1 is configured and working fine (I'm connecting to NFS server over it).
