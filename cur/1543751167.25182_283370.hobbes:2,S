Are you sure you want to use TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE here? If you are sure,
then you probably should add code which checks if schedule_timeout()
returns early because of signals (signals_pending(current) will be
true). Additionally, you may as well use msleep_interruptible(1000 /
OSST_POLL_PER_SEC), since you are requesting a 10th of a second sleep
(with OSST_POLL_PER_SEC #define'd to 10) (which is long & measurable
in milliseconds), you are not checking the return value (so you don't
seem to care how much time was left in the sleep) and
msleep_interruptible() will return on the same conditions as the
current code does. Seems like it should do what you want (still need
some means of checking for signals, though, I think).
If, in fact, you did not intend to use TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, but
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, then you may want to consider using msleep(1000
/ OSST_POLL_PER_SEC) [ignoring signals in addition to waitqueue
events].
If, though, you want to keep the code as is, then please ignore the
noise and I apologize :)
Thanks,
Nish
