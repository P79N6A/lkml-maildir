Alan you are thinking to PC here. On embedded devices that run X it is
just extra over head to use the VT interface. It would be much lighter
weigth to use the /dev/input/event interface. Personally I like to see
KBDRATE and alot of other junk go away in the console code. Intead we
just use the input api and /dev/fb with DRI. I have talked to Jim Getty
about this and likes to see things head in this direction.
P.S
   Jim Getty was working on having X windows using the input api :-)
