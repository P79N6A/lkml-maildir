I usually just do `cvs diff' :-)

You can probably find them by looking at the `distclean' targets
in the Makefiles.

I can't resist pointing out that although the default behavior of God's
editor doesn't handle symlinks (and hardlinks of course) in that way,
it's very easy to fix it (like I did years ago) in your .emacs:
	(setq-default backup-by-copying t)
or better yet:
	(setq make-backup-files nil)
