No.
What Sam means is that the warnings about externs not making sense in userspace
are indicators that there may be other external declarations (without "extern")
in those files, and that you should fix those at the same time (i.e. either
don't fix any of them, or fix all of them (in the same file)). If you don't
fix them at the same time, people tend to forget about them.
So the warnings are just considered canaries in our coal mine. Killing only the
canaries doesn't help.
