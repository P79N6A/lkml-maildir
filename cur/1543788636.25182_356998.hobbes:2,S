Devices continue to default to usb-storage, regardless if libusual is
configured. So, no explanations should be necessary at first. Fedora may
be different if we like how it works in Rawhide and let it into a release.
Then I would talk to Karsten about documenting this in Fedora handbook.
Although... I may be missing something about the behaviour of end users.
I thought that what we had before was transparent, but I was wrong.
I have some hopes for Gentoo users to tell me if libusual is workable
actually. They like to try new options as soon as they appear :-)

I think maybe if this use of it gets visible, it may be easier to
implement changes to request_module(), than if I were just mailing
to linux-kernel. Patch always speaks louder than words.
Maybe Keith or Rusty will have a look and bust this to bits, from
the module-init-tools perspective.
