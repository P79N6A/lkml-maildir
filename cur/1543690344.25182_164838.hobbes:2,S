I think I nailed it.
First I found one very strange thing in Mathieu's boot log:
--- mpbug-2.4.20	Wed Sep 10 17:19:05 2003
+++ mpbug-2.4.23-pre3	Wed Sep 10 17:18:44 2003
...
+DMI not present.
 Intel MultiProcessor Specification v1.1
 Virtual Wire compatibility mode.
 Default MP configuration #6
This means construct_default_ISA_mptable() still gets called.
Ok so far.
...
 ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
 Setting 2 in the phys_id_present_map
 ...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 2 ... ok.
smp_found_config is true, we're now in setup_IO_APIC()
and have completed setup_ioapic_ids_from_mpc(). Ok so far.
-init IO_APIC IRQs
-IO-APIC (apicid-pin) 2-0 not connected.
THIS IS BAD. setup_IO_APIC() calls setup_IO_APIC_IRQs(),
which starts by printk()ing the first line above.
This line is missing from the 2.4.23-pre3 dmesg log, which
seems like an impossibility.
At this point I was thinking "memory corruption",
and the following struck me:
What used to be arrays (mp_irqs[] etc) are now pointers to
memory which is sized and allocated by smp_read_mpc().
In the case when construct_default_ISA_mptable() is called,
smp_read_mpc() is _not_ called, the pointers never get initialised,
and reads and writes of these arrays end up in la-la land.
The fix would be to add allocation and initialisation of
these pointers at the start of construct_default_ISA_mptable().
I'll prepare a patch doing this sometime tomorrow.
