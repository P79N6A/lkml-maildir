You're still not answering my question, what is this failure
mode?  Xorg doesn't start?  The kernel crashes when Xorg starts?
Xorg starts but you get a blank screen?  You did not mention
this critical information anywhere.  Mentioning a list of other
kernels that "it's the same" for doesn't describe the failure
mode. :)
