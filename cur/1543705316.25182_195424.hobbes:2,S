Without this patch there is no warranty that a LVM_snapshot is updated
like the FS that is trying to replicate. DANGER !!!
I only see one solution:
to stop FS IO, and then # sync; sync; sync; lvcreate -s ...
Maybe it's needed to write, in the code or a doc, some warning about this
or to put a pointer to this patch :-?
