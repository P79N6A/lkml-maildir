I also have experienced problem with this driver quite ago... in the
times of last test kernels. I have used it (with trivial changes) for
accessing my mpio player.
Probably this is not what you are expecting to hear, but seems that this
driver is going to be obsolete. It does not do something special that
cannot be done in user-space using libusb. So, probably there is no
reason to fix it. Somebody should add libusb support to rio user-space
tools like it was done for mpio ones (mpio.sf.net).
