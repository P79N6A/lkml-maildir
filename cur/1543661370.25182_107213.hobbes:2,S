	But I content that when it is that much mainstream, you will
have 64 bit distros.

	I checked the errno list, and there was not one obvious
candidate. Potentially we could abuse ENOEXEC, but I must admit my
knowledge of errnos is too superficial.

	I want to see that ;-)

should loan me an Itanium box to make sure IrDA and Wireless LAN work
