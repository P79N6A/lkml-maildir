Subject: Linux 2.4.2 fails to merge mmap areas, 700% slowdown.

 Hi,
I upgraded one of our computer happily running 2.2.13 kernel
to 2.4.2. Everything was OK, but compilation time of our C++
project greatly increased (1.4 times slower). I investigated the
issue and found that g++ spends 7 times more time in kernel.
The reason for this is big vm map:
cat /proc/15677/maps |wc -l
   2238
15677 -- is cc1plus process, the map looks like this:
.....
4014a000-4014b000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
4014b000-4014c000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
4014c000-4014d000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
4014d000-4014e000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
4014e000-4014f000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
4014f000-40150000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
40150000-40151000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
40151000-40152000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0

2.4.2:

I noticed a recent thread (Re: Kernel is unstable) in archives that
ended by Linus:

Ehh.. If the merging doesn't actually happen, it's always a loss. We've
just spent CPU cycles on doing something useless. And in my tests, that
was the case a lot more than not.
Also, in the expense of taking a page fault, looking one or two levels
deeper in the AVL tree is pretty much not noticeable.
Show me numbers for real applications, and I might care. I saw barely
measurable speedups (and more importantly to me - real simplification)
by
removing it.
Don't bother arguing with "it might.."
                Linus

OK, the numbers are here. g++ is 2.96 from RedHat 7.0.
Please, CC me, as I'm not on the list.
