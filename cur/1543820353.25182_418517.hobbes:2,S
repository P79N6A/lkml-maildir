Tell me what is the difference between:
    sbi = kmalloc(sizeof(*sbi), GFP_KERNEL);
    if (!sbi)
        return -ENOMEM;
    sb->s_fs_info = sbi;
    memset(sbi, 0, sizeof(*sbi));
    sbi->s_mount_opt = 0;
    sbi->s_resuid = EXT3_DEF_RESUID;
    sbi->s_resgid = EXT3_DEF_RESGID;
and
    SuperBlock() : s_mount_opt(0), s_resuid(EXT3_DEF_RESUID), s_resgid(EXT3_DEF_RESGID)
    {}
    ...
    sbi = new SuperBlock;
    if (!sbi)
        return -ENOMEM;
apart that you don't get members initalized twice and get a shorter code :).
