I have a cPCI system running a Red Hat 2.4.18-3 Kernel. am running on a
Pentium III 700Mhz machine, but we have some of our own cPCI HW. I wrote the
drivers according to the Linux Device Driver 2nd edition (i.e. hot swap
compliant). But what I am missing is :
What SW will call my device insert/device remove routines?
Do I need some 3rd party SW?
Please CC me directly on anty response. By the way I read the PDF file  Hot
Pluggable Devices And The Linux Kernel, but I am still not clear on the
answerrs to the above questions.
