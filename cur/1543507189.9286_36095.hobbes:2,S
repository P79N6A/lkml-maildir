Subject: TCP/IP Hangs in 2.2.5 Fixed for 2.2.12?

Hi,
I was the one that reported a high load server dropping off the network
for certain machines at random times.  We were running 2.2.5 at the time.
Seeing as 2.2.12 seems to have fixed a lot of the problems inherent in the
releases between 2.2.5-2.2.11, we decided to upgrade yesterday.  We
haven't experienced the problem at all since the upgrade.  I don't know
what was fixed, but none of the clients are having trouble connecting to
the server anymore.  Knock on wood. :-)  We've run it for about a day so
far.
I just wanted to make a post to the list in case someone else has the same
problems.  
Thanks for all your help,
Ben
