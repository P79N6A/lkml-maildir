At this point we are really talking about PCI Power Management not
ACPI.  If we needed ACPI for driver power management, tons of existing
installations using APM or swsusp would be sunk.

Definitely attempt to remove the delay.  However, see if sleeping is
possible in lieu of calling udelay.

Sounds like things got fubar'd in your conversion.  This MMIO stuff
hasn't changed since 2.2.x; it sounds like the driver might be picking
the wrong PCI base address register to read for its ioaddr.
It shouldn't take long at all to port Donald's new natsemi.c to 2.4.x,
so I might do it.  (I've done the ports for several of the other PCI net
drivers in the 2.4.x kernel)
