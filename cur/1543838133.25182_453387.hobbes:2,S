How could this be wasting space? If you compile with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
disabled then __cpuinitdata will become __initdata - ie the same as
before. Not a single byte wasted what I can tell.
The first version of this patch simply added a missing __init to some
function, but I was then corrected by akpm that __cpuinit should be used
instead.
