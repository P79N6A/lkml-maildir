It's not legal to call generic_make_request() on a buffer_head, if you
have not acquired the BH_Lock first. The buffer_head will be unlocked on
IO completion, so that basically tells you that you cannot issue more
than _one_ generic_make_request() on a buffer_head.
If you fail to comply with that, then you will basically corrupt the
existing request in the queue where the buffer is attached. You _must_
do a lock_buffer() before calling generic_make_request.
