Bugger, bugger, bugger bugger.  That's it.  Just ran 4GB linear
mapping with 4k pages through by hash scattering simulator - max
bucket load is 2 with the old algo and 16 with the new one.  Well, we
just found the first case where the new algorithm scatters
significantly worse than the old one.  It would be something this
dire, wouldn't it.
