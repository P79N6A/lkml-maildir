I haven't really reviewed it, but when I grepped through it last, I
found a few alarming things, like use of __put_page, trying to remove
pages from pagecache (duplicating parts of vmscan.c, plus bugs), and
taking tree_lock.
Mostly didn't look like big problems to fix, but should be fixed for
mm/ maintainers' sanity. Maybe it's better now, though.
