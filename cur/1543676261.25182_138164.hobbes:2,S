Subject: IDE CDRW and ide-scsi fun?

I have a DVD-CDRW:
'SONY    ' 'DVD RW DRU-510A ' '1.0a' Removable CD-ROM
If I compile ide-cd and ide-scsi into the kernel I can see the drives
but cdrecord doesn't recognize them, even if I specify the device (2,0,0).
If I compile either one in and modularize the other I get the same
thing.  If I modularize both and then load them:
modprobe ide-scsi
modprobe ide-cd
They load just fine.
I've currently got my burn script which sets my common options to load
and unload the modules but this strikes me as a rather hackish way
around the problem.
Kernel is 2.4.20 through 2.4.21-rc7-ac1.
