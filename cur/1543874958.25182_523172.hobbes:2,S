Ok, thanks for the explanation. I wondered why you call
pci_restore_state() here, normally that's only called from .resume
handlers.

You're right, I had only the case in mind where the network device
doesn't generate any interrupts (in initialisation phase and in
shutdown phase) because it's disabled in the device, and the interrupt
handler is only called because of IRQ-sharing/irqpoll.

Could you please CC me, I'd like to test it here.
Thanks,
