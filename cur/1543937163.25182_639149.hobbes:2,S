Hi Ingo,
I have permission for a binary only release (mailed the supervisor
intermediately after your earler mail). I'm sure the abstract code
simulating the workload will be alright too, but I need time to put it
together as I'm a bit swamped at the moment. Will hope to have it in
the next few days.
regards,
       Colin
