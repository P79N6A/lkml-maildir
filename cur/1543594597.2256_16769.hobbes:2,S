either apply this patch to 2.4.5ac15:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.5aa3/00_fix-unusable-vm-on-alpha-1
(note it is not an alpha specific bug, it's just that I was triggering
all the time on alpha so I called the patch that way)
or better use 2.4.6pre3aa1:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.6pre3aa1.bz2
If the problem persists let me know thanks.
Andrea
