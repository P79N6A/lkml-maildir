Is there a system call or library function which a process can use to
determine the start of its data segment . I need to know the start of
the data segment so that process does not cross its DATA limit. Using
this information & sbrk it knows how much data space is already used &
how much it can grow further without crossing the limit.
Thanks
Ram Gupta
