Here they are...

+compile
I moved the previous runs to the sched-fifo* directories where they
belong.  For convenience, I moved all the summary data logs here...
  
http://www.joq.us/jack/benchmarks/.SUMMARY
Unfortunately, these corrected tests do not compare favorably with the
earlier sched-fifo runs (mistaken or otherwise).  I wanted to believe
the problem was just a matter of priorities, but evidently it is not.
In fact, for this test the priority scheduler does not really help at
all (though I believe it will for other things).  The max delay
numbers are still all over the place...

I'll try building a SCHED_RR version of JACK.  I still don't think it
will make any difference.  But my intuition isn't working very well
right now, so I need more data.
I still wonder if some coding error might occasionally be letting a
lower priority process continue running after an interrupt when it
ought to be preempted.
