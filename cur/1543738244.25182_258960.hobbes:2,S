I've read that the other main difficulty besides block device size
limits is problems with the ext2 management tools themselves.  So, how
would you rate my chances of using a 2.6 kernel with XFS (and xfs
management tools of course) with a 5 TB filesystem?  Probably not a well
tested scenerio to say the least...
