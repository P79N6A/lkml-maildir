For the purpose of this discussion (Linux memory
barrier semantics, on WB memory), it is true of CPU
and compiler barriers.

Obviously because we want some kind of ordering
guarantee at a given point. All the CPU barriers
in the world are useless if the compiler can reorder
access over them.

One or both of us still fails to understand the other.
bit_spin_lock(LOCK_NR, &word);
var++;
/* this is bit_spin_unlock(LOCK_NR, &word); */
smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
clear_bit(LOCK_NR, &word);
Are you saying that it is OK for the store to var to
be reordered below the clear_bit? If not, what are you
saying?
