Hi Eric,
 My failing Opteron system (IDE disk, no SCSI disk) now boots with your
2.6.3 Fusion patch in place.  My good Opteron system (SCSI disk, no IDE
disk) also continues to boot with this patch in place.
Thanks!
Joe
PS: Although booting, the boot messages from the once-failing system
indicate some rather unnerving failures.  Should I be concerned?
