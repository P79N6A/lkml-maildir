K, I'll give it a try.

By that I assume you mean osl-1.1 like libata.c, rather than GPL
like ata_piix.c....  I expect I may be copying bits and pieces
from the Promise driver though.  Certainly I'd like to use as
much of their header files as seems practical.  So it may very
well need to stay GPL'd.  But I'll see what I can do.

Cool.  I have a TX2 as well.  Hope I don't fry it... :)
