Hi All,
I tried loading a simple char driver on kernel 2.6 but it is giving invalid
module parameter.
This module is working very fine on kernel 2.4 . The kernel version I am
using is linux-2.6.5-7.97-smp.
I know that the insmod procedure has changed but dont know how to do it.
If anybody know the procedure , kindly tell this to me.
Thanks & regards ,
sujeet kumar
