Can't offer any suggestion, except that I suffered the same pain as you
with 2.5.69-mm7: if I compile 2.5.69-mm7 with gcc 3.2.3, the ymfpci
(Yamaha DS-XG PCI driver) causes a lot of problems, like oopses when
compiled as a module, or panics when built-in.
The problems went away the moment I compiled using gcc 2.96. I think
this is caused by some gcc compiler bug (in fact, I've never been able
to make gcc 3.2 compile itself and pass all tests).
