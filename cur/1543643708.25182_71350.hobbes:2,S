So most (all?) of these don't work.
Have you tried Rogier's 'seek' program yet?

If sector 0 isn't readable, just use the secondpart instructions
that Rogier posted.  Start with a fairly large number (like he
used, was it 0x10000 ?).  If that works, use smaller values of
the seek offset and try to find the smallest value that still
works.  The first sector with the smallest value that works
_might_ be a master boot record/partition table with some useful
info in it, or it might just be a boot record followed by a
FAT filesystem, or something_else_who_knows_what.
Anyway, if you can do that, you can post the data and I'll take
a look at it.
