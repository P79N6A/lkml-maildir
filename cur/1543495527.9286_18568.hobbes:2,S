I can very reliably lock up a grep process in 2.2.7 in uninterruptable
sleep (D) when accessing a set of files stored under ncpfs.
Question is: what kind of information should I provide to help isolate
the problem?
[This is going to be painful for me to diagnose: once one process is
locked up everything that touches ncpfs locks up, and the machine does
"real work" where long uptimes are nice.]
[Please CC me on replies -- this will make thread stand out for me.]
Thanks,
