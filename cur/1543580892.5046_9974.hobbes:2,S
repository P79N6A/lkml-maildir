Hi Andre,
  if you remember, last week I complained that Promise corrupts data
when I copy them from hdh to hde. Today I did some more experiments
(running 2.4.1-ac1) and found:
1) Debian sid's 'cmp' prints incorrect offsets when files differ
   in more than one place if distance > cmp buffer size :-(
2) When I read data from hdh (UDMA2 Toshiba) sometime last four
   bytes of 4KB page (== probably last 4 bytes of read request)
   are not read at all and old contents of page is left here
   (it happens about once per 20MB read; and in about 1% of
   these last 8 bytes of page are incorrect).
   I have no idea whether promise or KT133 is at fault, but
   it for sure does not happen under Windows...
3) During write some corruption can happen on either hde (IBM
   DTLA-307045 running UDMA5) or hdh - it looks like that
   data are shifted on HDD, as fsck then complains about
   imagic set, dtime set while inode not deleted and so on,
   and then it cleaned inodes 178200-178300 from my hde :-(
   Fortunately they were mostly in old kernel trees,
   not in current data (except one inode, which was just
   created by dpkg)
4) So I compiled kernel without IDE DMA support at all and now
   everything works at PIO4 without any corruption...
  If anybody has any idea what I should try to get UDMA to
work under Linux here...
