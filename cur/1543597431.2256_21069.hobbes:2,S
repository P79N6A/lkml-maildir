I'm really not sure if this is pertinent to Linux Kernel, but I'm asking here anyway, 0 in advance if it's not.
I have a file that is approximately 3.25GB and my system keeps bitching about "Value too large for defined data type."  Is there any way to stop this?  Since I'm sure you're wondering why I have a file that large, I'm using it via loopback as my MP3 partition, so I can remove it fairly quick if the need should ever arise.
