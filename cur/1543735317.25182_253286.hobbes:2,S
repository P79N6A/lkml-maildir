I coded a IPC system before use atomic add + share memory.  
It works very well (fast) on 4 CPU SMP system, since it doesn't use 
any locking API at all.    Very good for resource allocation for 
SMP.     I implemented speciall malloc/free use by ISR, different
prority process
completely without any lock.   Negative side, it use more memory.
