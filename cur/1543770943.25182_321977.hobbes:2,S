With testing I meant to run the OS on the bare hardware in the
final configuration and verifying that it works (possibly by measuring
the worst case latencies you get during the testing, like what Ingo does
to claim worst case latency for preempt-RT).

Yes, that's what I meant.

Indeed, that's why I believe hard-RT with preempt-RT is just a joke.

Exactly.
