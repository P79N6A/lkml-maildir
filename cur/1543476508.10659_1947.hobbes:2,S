Someone mentioned that rebuilding the kernel was significantly faster on
their machine, with HZ == 400 instead of 100.
More rapid bottom-half handling is the only reason I can think of for
that.  Apart from different I/O characteristics, I'd expect the
CPU-bound part of the compile to run _slower_ because of the increase
in cache flushing.
