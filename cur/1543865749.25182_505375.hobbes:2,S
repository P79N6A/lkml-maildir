The current way is to remount things, and return -EROFS to any process
that attempts to write(). Unless we want to kill processes to get rid of
them [most likely we possibly won't], I am fine with how things are atm.
So, what's the "dangerous" part, actually?

sysrq+u is helpful. It is like \( sysrq+s && make sure no further writes
go to disk \).
