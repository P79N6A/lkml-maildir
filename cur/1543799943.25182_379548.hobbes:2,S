Hmm, never tried it. My CLI is pine.

It's not sending patches in CLI that's avoided, but which email client
I happen to be using at the moment.  Now I'm using pine.

It's not that people can't use a CLI tool, but a non CLI may be better for
certain things.  Like I use both emacs and vi (well vim really).  When I
need to make quick edits or work on something for a little, I use vi, and
when I'm in it for the long hall (several hours of programming) I use
emacs.
Or, if I edit something remotely, I use vi too.
The same goes with evolution and pine.  If I'm testing a kernel on my main
computer (like now), I reboot often and when I check my mail, I use pine,
or if I just want to quickly look at who sent me an email.  When I have a
stable computer and I'm testing kernels on one of my test boxes, I pull up
evolution and do all my email with that.  Also when checking email
remotely, pine is really good.
I like gui email since it is a lot easier to organize lots of mail (select
a bunch, drag and drop).  So don't just put someone down if they don't
happen to use a CLI email client.
