Short answer: none of it is.  If it happens to handle jumbo frames nicely
that is mainly a lucky accident, and we do need to check that they actually
works.
Minor rant: the whole skb_alloc familly has degenerated into an unholy
mess and could use some rethinking.  I believe the current patch gets as
far as three _'s at the beginning of a function, this shows it is high
time to reroll the api.

Daniel
