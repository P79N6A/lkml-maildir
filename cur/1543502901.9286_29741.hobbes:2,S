Still in 99.99% such cases it's bug in program not exposed by Solaris but
exposed by Linux so you should talk with authors of sipd server ...

Then ask someone who can. pthread.c is part of LinuxThreads package/or GLibC
(gosh, you do not even said what are you using!) but I bet it's just wrong
call. It's absolutely pointless to ask HERE, at least. Noone can halp you
without long deep digging in sipd. And even if it's LinuxThreads/GLibC/kernel
bug it must be isolated and small and simple program to show bug must be
created...

Ask sipd authors. It's POSSIBLE that it's bug in LinuxThreads/GLibC/kernel but
probabilyty is MUCH higher for bug in program: there are PLENTY threaded
programs working on Linux without glitch...
