One might say the same thing about someone who claims not to have a
moral right to force certain choices on others in some circumstances
(e.g. when those others have used copyrighted work in a product and
ought to understand that for some not insignificant portion of the
copyright holders, the terms implicitly included preserving certain
"freedoms" for downstream recipients) while reserving a very similar
moral right with others (e.g. potential murderers, theives,
tresspassers, distributors of proprietary derived works).
As I pointed out in a previous message in the thread, that some people
want the copyright holders -- who have economic power over the
hardware vendors who use Linux in their products -- to force a
desireable outcome for those without that power (i.e. the small number
of people who buy TiVOs or Linksys routers who actually care about
source availability and who get told "don't buy it" as if that will
change anything) is understandable.
I think that there's a legitimate concern about what types of
constraints it's valid for a copyright holder to try to enforce w/ a
license -- I think it's immoral for an employer to force an employee
to toil at a meaningless, soul-crushing job for the vast majority of
one's single, short existence if they could make it more enjoyable,
but I'd hate to see someone try to enforce that with a license (I'm
happy telling a person in that situation to "just quit" just as you
tell people "just don't buy it"). To call people who draw the line in
a different place than you hypocrites is BS.
Your pragmatic arguments make much more sense than your moralistic ones, IMHO.
