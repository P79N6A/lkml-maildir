Look everyone, it was determined to be a deadlock because of some
interaction between how rsync sets up it's communication channels
with the ssh subprocess, readas: userland bug.
I don't remember if the specific problem was in rsync itself or some
buggy version of ssh.  One can search the list archives to discover
Alexey's full analysis of the problem.  I don't have a URL handy.
