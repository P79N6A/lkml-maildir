Not quite. For one, it does actually break some apps. You can do it,
you just have to have some idea of what you're breaking and propagate
that onward somehow. Backward-incompatible userspace ABI changes can't
be undertaken as lightly as backward-incompatible kernel ABI changes.
There needs to be something that says "backward-incompatible ABI change
happened $HERE" somewhere people who aren't kernel hacking can find it.
There has to be some kind of warning somewhere; we can't just do it silently.
