Afaik, ECN can still be disabled to support buggy system. Enableing it by
default is a 'political' statement in the sense that we expect use
of the standard. Unfortunately the linux kernel can't detect miscompliance
on its own (if a site explicitly says: I don't support ECN this would be
already standard compliant).
I don't know about the benefits of the use of ECN, so I can't comment
if it makes sense to enable it by default on several distribs and here on
vger compared with the problems several people may experience.
It's an interesting experiment actually: Is the linux community powerful
enough to force vendors/people to fix their products and deploy updates to
comply to standards or can they just ignore it.
Michael.
