Hello All,
While I'm reading the datasheet for the (EXAR) ST16550, this is an uart
with fifo's, I'm beginning to believe that the serial driver should
maintain a copy of this write-only register.
I understand (from this info) that when bits that are programmed i.e. FIFO
RX or TX trigger level the others must be re-written or they will be
lost(reset).
Is it possible that it works that way?
It is my feeling that is allways a good thing to keep a copy of a
write-only hardware register.
Regards
Kees
