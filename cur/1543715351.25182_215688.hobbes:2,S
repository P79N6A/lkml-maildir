Actually dmidecode dumps hard-coded BIOS data, so it will not change
unless you upgrade your BIOS.

This one is for humans and anything can be in the string.
+                       MATCH(DMI_BOARD_VENDOR,
"
http://www.abit.com.tw/"
),
+                       MATCH(DMI_BOARD_NAME, "NF7-S/NF7,NF7-V
(nVidia-nForce2)"
),
+                       MATCH(DMI_BIOS_VERSION, "6.00 PG"),
+                       MATCH(DMI_BIOS_DATE, "03/24/2004") }},
These are keys in the DMI table, and have to match the BIOS (as seen in
dmidecode) exactly.

Phoenix and Award merged.
Doesn't really matter what it says, it is just a string compare to
linux.  Also, I chose not to look at the BIOS vendor in this example
b/c it adds no value, here we're just looking at BOARD vendor & name,
plus BIOS version and date.
Thanks for confirming that the entry matched your system and that the
patch triggered automatically.
