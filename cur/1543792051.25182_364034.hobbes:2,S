Well, that's really wierd, It Should Work(tm) :)
Did you apply both patches (Rusty's + mine), or only the latter?
Could you send me debug output please? The first time I met the problem, 
I used a modprobe wrapper which dumped /proc/modules and modprobe 
stdout/stderr to a temp file.
I would like to also mention, that my patch leaves a very little time 
window open, but that's only a problem if module unloading is also 
happening: after parsing /proc/modules, but before actually loading the 
module, it is possible that an rmmod unloads (starts to unload) a 
dependant module. But this does not affect booting.
