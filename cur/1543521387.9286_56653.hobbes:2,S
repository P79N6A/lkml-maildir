Hi,
 I'm writing a program which needs to directly read from
x86 MSRs. I've hunted around and found two kernel patches
that provide such features.
One by Richard Gooch, which seems to have a dependancy upon
devfs, and another by Stephan Meyer which uses a char device.
I have a hacked up MSR access driver I wrote myself which exports
the registers into read-only /proc space.
Which of the above methods would be more likely to appear
in the standard kernel someday ?
