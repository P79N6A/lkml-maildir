Something changed between 2.6.17-rc5-mm2 and -mm3 that broke tg3
on my HP DL360:
2.6.17-rc5-mm2:
  tg3.c:v3.59 (May 26, 2006)
  ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:01:02.0[A] -> GSI 30 (level, low) -> IRQ 177
  eth0: Tigon3 [partno(N/A) rev 1002 PHY(5703)] (PCIX:100MHz:64-bit) 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet 00:0e:7f:b4:69:94
  eth0: RXcsums[1] LinkChgREG[0] MIirq[0] ASF[0] Split[0] WireSpeed[1] TSOcap[1] 
  eth0: dma_rwctrl[769f4000] dma_mask[64-bit]
2.6.17-rc5-mm3 (with a bit of debug showing tg3_read_mem result):
  tg3.c:v3.59 (May 26, 2006)
  ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:01:02.0[A] -> GSI 30 (level, low) -> IRQ 177
  tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg:
  tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg: val 0xffffffff (magic 0x4b657654)
  tg3_phy_probe: after readphy, err -16 hw_phy_id 0x0
  tg3_phy_probe: phy_id 0xffffffff
  lookup_by_subsys: vendor 0xe11 dev 0xcb
  tg3: (0000:01:02.0) phy probe failed, err -19
  tg3: Problem fetching invariants of chip, aborting.
The tg3 driver itself didn't change, so it must be some other PCI
change or something.  The only other PCI device I have (a Smart
Array with cciss driver) works fine.
I'll try to narrow down the problem tomorrow, but I'll post this in
case it's obvious to somebody.
