   I don't like this fix.  I know 32767 is a lot of links, but I don't like
   artificially lowering a limit like this just because one architecture
   defines nlink_t incorrectly.  I'd rather get rid of the compiler warnings
   with a cast in the few places the limit is checked, even though that is
   a little bit ugly.
"incorrectly"?  There are no correct or incorrect values for any
of these types, which is why they are defined on a per-platform
basis.
If you impose different limits on different platforms, that means
that a jfs/reiserfs filesystem that works properly on one platform
may not function properly on another.
That is something I'd certainly deem "incorrect" :-)
Every other filesystem can be plugged into an arbitrary Linux platform
and be expected to work properly, don't make jfs/reiserfs an exception
to this.
