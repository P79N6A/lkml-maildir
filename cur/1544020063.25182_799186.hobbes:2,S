Andrew,
Thanks for your feedback. Your summary is precisely the intent. As I
mentioned in check-in notice, this isn't my work per se, but a fix of prior
unsubmitted work. Consequently, I can only speculate on the original
implementation choices of the primary authors (Yuri Tikhonov
<yur@emcraft.com> on behalf of Denx from what I can ascertain from GIT
logs). I've added Wolfgang in the event he can add background where
appropriate.
I believe this to be a useful feature for the embedded system space;
however, I am not wedded in any way to the current implementation and am
happy to evolve it as needed to meet the needs of key stakeholders.

Again, conjecturing, I suspect the goal was to ensure that the boot messages
appear on the console or in the syslog before kernel messages of that
particular boot cycle. Depending on the board and architecture in question,
the kernel log buffer may have several messages in it by the time the log
coalescing code runs. For example, on the board I tested this on:
    # dmesg
    U-Boot 1.3.3 (Jan  9 2009 - 10:24:45)
    POST memory PASSED
    POST ecc PASSED
    POST cache PASSED
    POST ethernet PASSED
    Using Kilauea machine description
    log_buf=fdffc000
    Linux version 2.6.27.7 (gerickson@ubuntu-fusion) (gcc version 4.0.0
(DENX ELDK 4.1 4.0.0)) #1 Fri Jan 9 10:30:30 PST 2009
"Using Kilauea..." is already in the kernel buffer when the time comes
around to coalesce the buffer.
In the case of u-boot, it uses logging code nearly identical to Linux, so
employing the straightforward approach of 'printk("%s", external_buffer)'
would result in:
    # dmesg
    U-Boot 1.3.3 (Jan  9 2009 - 10:24:45)
    <4>POST memory PASSED
    <4>POST ecc PASSED
    <4>POST cache PASSED
    <4>POST ethernet PASSED
    Using Kilauea machine description
Not the end of the world, but not ideal either.

Agreed; however, I'm not sure how often this technique is employed in
embedded systems versus desktop systems.
I'd be happy to keep the existing log buffer and perform a prepend from the
boot buffer to it rather than an append of the kernel buffer to the boot
buffer. Thoughts?

On the PPC mailing list, there were some solid proposals using the device
tree that would make the configuration a bit cleaner. In those cases,
there's simply a board/architecture method/probe enabled by Kconfig that
would perform the aforementioned prepend operation.

It's defined by u-boot and used by u-boot in relation to how it manages POST
status and its log buffer.

Again, I am simply conjecturing here; however, I would guess that for the
case of the co-located boot log metadata and buffer data, there was a desire
to provide a buffer of the same page-aligned size as the default kernel
buffer (16 KiB) and then a desire to use 5 words of metadata but, again,
keep things "easy" by just stealing/reserving a whole, additional page.

I've definitely read and understand it. Again, conjecturing here, but I
would guess that for the non-colocated buffer/metadata case, the original
author(s) were perhaps trying to avoid placing xe32_to_cpu or such in the
generic kernel logging code.
If we take the prepend-and-preserve-the-kernel-buffer tack, I think this
would all largely get cleaned-up and disappear. Prepend I/O would then be
relegated to architecture- or board-specific code.
Thoughts? Wolfgang?

See comments above.
If you and Wolfgang are supportive of the prepend and preserve approach, I
think I can take another pass at this and eliminate a good measure of the
implementation concerns.
I welcome your further feedback.
