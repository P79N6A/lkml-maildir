Not at all. You have configured the both sym53c8xx and ncr53c8xx drivers 
and the sym53c8xx driver just misdetects your 810 as a 810A. It is in 
fact a tiny bug in the sym driver (a 'continue' that should have been 
a 'break'). I will make the fix available soon.

The driver checks the SCRIPTS execution prior to initializing everything. 
The script execution failure is due to use of LOAD/STORE SCRIPTS
instructions that are not supported by the 810 (not A) and the sym53c8xx
driver does not attach this 810 device.  (The cache misconfiguration is a
spurious message in that situation since the 810 (not A) just didn't
recognise the LOAD/STORE instructions).

The ncr53c8xx is called at its detection entry point after the sym53c8xx
and has attached the 810 normally. 
If you want to get rid of the sym53c8xx messages, you can make another
kernel that does not configure this driver , or exclude your 810 device
for this driver from the boot command line: 'sym53c8xx=excl:0x7100'
