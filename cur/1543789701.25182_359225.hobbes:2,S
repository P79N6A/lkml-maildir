Yes.  In arch/ia64/kernel/ivt.S:
ENTRY(page_not_present)
        DBG_FAULT(20)
        mov r16=cr.ifa
        rsm psr.dt
        /*
         * The Linux page fault handler doesn't expect non-present
pages to be in
         * the TLB.  Flush the existing entry now, so we meet that expectation.
         */
        mov r17=PAGE_SHIFT<<2
        ;;
        ptc.l r16,r17
