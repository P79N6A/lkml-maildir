For non-event based data gathering using kprobes we can have a debugfs file
like /debug/kprobes/snapshot_probe and write a kprobe module with probe at
->write() function and then the user space can trigger the data collection
echo "1" > /debug/kprobes/snapshot_probe
Thus, the actual data collection code can reside in a separate
module or a systemtap script which provides very good post-processing
capabalities, and can be used without recompiling or rebooting the kernel.
