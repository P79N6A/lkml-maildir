 Ah yes, I had forgotten about that thread. I'll go look through
 the archives later today, to make sure I don't duplicate any work
 already done 8-)

 Matthew Wilcox came up with a suggestion of fs.h fathering an inode.c
 which may not be an entirely bad idea given how many files pull in
 fs.h just for the inode definition, but don't need any of the fluff
 that goes along with it.
 The patch I posted yesterday still has 1-2 flaws (I introduced
 two circular dependancies in fs.h Ahem, frighteningly easy to do
 unless you keep generating the graphs and looking what changed)
 I'll fix it up, and post a corrected version tonight sometime.
