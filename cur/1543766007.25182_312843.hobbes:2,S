Depends entirely on the io scheduler. CFQ may put several on the
dispatch list.

It is the cleaner interpretation. CFQ marks requests as requeued
internally and gives preference to them for reissue, but it may return
another first (actually, I think it even checks for ->requeued on
dispatch sort, so it wont right now).

It's not noise, it would be nice to have this entirely documented so
that there isn't any confusion on what is guaranteed vs what currently
happens in most places.
But I don't want to document that they are never reordered. For requeues
it make sense to maintain ordering in most cases, but it also may make
sense to reorder for higher priority io. If the driver does _not_ want a
particular request reordered for data integrity reasons, then that needs
to be explicitly specified.
