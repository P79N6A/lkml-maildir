Last time I heard serious databases use their own memmory 
management/caching in combination with O_DIRECT, i.e. they bypass the 
kernel's buffering system completely. Hence I would deem them irrelevant to 
the problem at hand...
If a database were not to use O_DIRECT I would think it would be using mmap 
so it would have madvise already... but I am not a database expert so take 
this with a pinch of salt...
Best regards,
Anton
