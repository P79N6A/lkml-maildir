Yes, agreed.

Seems reasonable except that on i386 you keep the old linker script, indeed; I 
think that the linker script shouldn't be per architecture.
Also (not verified) one section is either read-write or read-only, so 
merging .bss and .text does not seem good to me (I separated them on 
purpose).
Good catch for using .bss instead of .data.
