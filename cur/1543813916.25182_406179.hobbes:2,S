Existing OProfile codes treats pentium M as i386/piii as it should more or less.

In the quick hack I did over the week-end, I followed what John had done
for IA-64. In other words, I also have a get_cpu() routine for i386 and
I basically did a cut&paste of what was in nmi_int.c. As such,
/dev/oprofile/cpu_type is preserved to avoid confusing ophelp.

Libpfm is really a helper library and is not required to use the kernel
interface. However, there is a bit of an anomaly in libpfm at the moment.
The library also includes the kernel header files and perfmon2 syscall stubs.
Both would eventually be found in libc.  As such, for the time being, some
applications may choose to link against libpfm, just for the stubs. The current
oprofiled does not do this and has every perfmon.h definitions it needs hardcoded
(syscalls stubs are also recreated).

Yes that could be a possibility. That implies that there may be
situations where perfmon does not support a processor that is
somehow supported by OProfile. I suspect this could be the case
for very old CPUs.
