My point was that the architecture of Suspend2 is fundamentally different to 
that of swsusp. Suspend2 features could potentially be added to swsusp, but 
it would require a lot of work on swsusp. I've worked hard to make Suspend2 
clean and ready for merging. I'm not claiming it's perfect (we've already 
seen a few cleanups I missed), but I fail to see why I should be made to do 
even more work on the old version when I've already said that getting from it 
to Suspend2 involved substantial rewrites. Sure, I know where I'd be headed, 
but it would be a huge waste of time and effort.
Regards,
Nigel
