           Summary: SDET hangs
    Kernel Version: 2.5.70-mjb1
            Status: NEW
          Severity: blocking

SDET hangs on NUMA-Q fairly constistently. I've now tried it with the feral
driver to eliminate that. ALT sysrq info will be attatched.

Things mainly seem to be stuck in do_page_fault or filemap_nopage

Oh, and I should point out that this works fine in 2.5.69-mjb1, but not
2.5.70-mjb1, but it's exactly the same set of patches.
