Hello!
   We are working on a lustre client that would not require any patches
   to linux kernel. And there are few things that would be nice to have
   that I'd like your input on.
   One of those is FMODE_EXEC - to correctly detect cross-node situations with
   executing a file that is opened for write or the other way around, we need
   something like this extra file mode to be present (and used as a file open
   mode when opening files for exection, e.g. in fs/exec.c)
   Do you think there is a chance this can be included into vanilla kernel,
   or is there a better solution I oversee?
   I am just thinking about something as simple as this
   (with some suitable FMODE_EXEC define, of course):

   Thanks.
