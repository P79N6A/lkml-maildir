Where is those public and transparent and moderated Linux-Kernel "ToDo"- or "Keep an eye on"-list, sorted by priorities, with sort of a "vote for this feature"-button, so those guys have something they can pick up? There is so much great stuff and ideas out there where they could put their work onto or getting involved, it just needs to be found or sort of being "managed" a little bit better.

The interest in many nice projects often is quite low and evolution quite slow, but not only because of the fact that they aren`t great, but more because of not getting widely known. It`s not always missing specs, it`s also some missing noise/feedback for different features or missing of some "driving force" to bring things forward. How should one developer know that somebody needs a feature if those who could probably need it don`t request it? Maybe just because of the fact that they even imagine that such feature would be possible ?

A quick answer for philosophers:

For example, i don't know if somebody volunteered to be a bug-buddy in
google, see Andrew's 2.6.20-rc6-mm1 announcement. It seems no, as he
still forwards bugzilla reports to developers/maintainers.
I myself am new. But anyway, i can write a little bit of HOWTO
-- effectively handle (among others) LKML, to break free from myths,
-- to not afraid emacs as good editor for issues like symbol-searching (TAGS),
   whitespace, spell (typos) and such,
-- having linux tree up-today with small bandwidth: mirrors, patches, quilt
of course if such things prevent people from participating.
[:(ot) As for Greg's message, imho somebody was bored. There is plenty  ;]

So my.
