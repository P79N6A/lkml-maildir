I thought you planned to read from CSA pacct file?
Well, while we are in discussion of whether to merge and
replace BSD accounting with CSA accounting, your proposed
change will provide you data on charater I/O in a BSD pacct
file. I supposed you do not need to have seperate fields on
character-read and character-written? CSA will provide the
data separately.
CSA writes the data to a CSA pacct file in a similar way as
BSD on exit callback at do_acct_process(). The CSA's exit
callback is implemented as a loadable module. The CSA
project and code can be downloaded at
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/csa.
