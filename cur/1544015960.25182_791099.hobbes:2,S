Hi Ira,
   Interesting system: the guest being able to access the host's memory but not (fully) vice-versa makes this a little different from the current implementations where that was assumed.  virtio assumes that the guest will publish buffers and someone else (ie. the host) will access them.

   There were some earlier implementations, but they were trivial.  And not particularly helpful in your case.
In summary, yes, it should work quite nicely, but rather than publishing the buffers to the host, the host will need to tell the guest where it wants them transferred (possibly using that 1M window, and a notification mechanism).  That will be the complex part I think.
Cheers,
Rusty.
