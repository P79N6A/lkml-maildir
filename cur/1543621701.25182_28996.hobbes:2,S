Hi,
I am currently working on the porting of some programs from Solaris to
Linux. The main problem I have is that the original programs heavily use
mmap in order to access very big files (more than 4GB) (since it is a
64 bits operating system), but on Linux mmap will fail. Is there any clean
way to solve this problem? Please CC me the response at this e-mail
address: mihaii@caip.rutgers.edu.
Thank you very much,
Mihail Ionescu
