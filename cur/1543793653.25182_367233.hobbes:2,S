One important point is to get remaining problems reported:
All the known issues in e.g. xfs, dm or reiser4 should have been 
addressed.
But how many issues have never been reported because people noticed that 
disabling CONFIG_4KSTACKS fixed the problem for them and therefore 
didn't report it?
I experienced something similar with my patch to schedule OSS drivers 
with ALSA replacements for removal - when someone reported he needed an 
OSS driver for $reason I asked him for bug numbers in the ALSA bug 
tracking system - and the highest number were 4 new bugs against one 
ALSA driver.
Unconditionally enabling 4k stacks is the only way to achieve this.
And the fact that it might force people to help with the development or 
at least use open source drivers for their hardware instead of 
binary-only Windows drivers isn't exactly a disadvantage for the 
development of Linux.
