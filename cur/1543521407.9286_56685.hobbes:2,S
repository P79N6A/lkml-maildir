Subject: Possible problem with IDE DMA in 2.3.38 (no problem in 2.2.13) ?

First of all I want to appologize if I'm restating a well known problem, or
if I have misunderstood something - if that's the case, then please ignore
this email.
I am running Slackware Linux 7.0 on a IBM ThinkPad 600.
If I'm using kernel 2.2.13 then I have no problems with enabling
"CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO" everything runs just fine (for days at a time).
But if I enable the equivalent option "CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO" in the
2.3.38 kernel, then the machine locks solid just before detecting my
partition layout.
Here are the last few lines of output I get before the kernel locks up:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 09
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xfcf0-0xfcf7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xfcf8-0xfcff, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: IBM-DYKA-23240, ATA DISK drive
hdc: TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-1702BC, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15

Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a National Semiconductor PC87306

And then the machine just locks up solid. I can't even power it off by
using the power button or CTRL+ALT+DEL. I have to use the little
emergency power off button (the one inside a little hole) to shut down
the machine. When the machine hangs, the HD LED stays on, but there is
no sounds from the drive.
I have only tried this with 2.2.13 and 2.3.38 (since those are the only
kernel sources I currently have, but I remember also enabling this
option on 2.2.6 without problems), and 2.2.13 works fine no matter if I
turn AUTO DMA on or off. 2.3.38 locks solid every time I turn it on.
If you want me to try other kernel versions and/or patches then I'm
game, just let me know...
Here's some additional info that may or may not be usefull:
