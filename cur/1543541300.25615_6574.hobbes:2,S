   The only logical reason to not use KERNEL_VERSION is if you want to
   support 2.0.x (which should be deprecated, IMHO anyways).  
There *are* still people using 2.0 in production environments.  Without
naming names, let's just say that some important parts of the
Internet/web infrastructure are still using Linux 2.0 systems, and that
if you've surfed the web lately, you've probably used a 2.0 system
without knowing it.
As Alan Cox has pointed out 2.0 probably had the most stable VM,
compared to either 2.2 or 2.4.....  For folks who don't need the sexy
new features of the newer kernels, sometimes staying on the older
kernels for stability's sake makes good operational sense.
