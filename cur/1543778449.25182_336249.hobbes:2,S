I haven't touched the maestro drivers in so long (for near-total lack of
docs, etc.) that I can't be considered authoritative for approving it's
removal.  If people are relying on it I certainly don't know who they
are.  In better news, Takashi should now have the pile of maestro
hardware that I used in the first pass to help him maintain the ALSA
driver..
