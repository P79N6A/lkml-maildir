This is something that is my style - I don't care for "#if 0" or "#if
1".  I usually drop a "#undef COMMENT_TAG" someplace with a "/* ... */"
comment next to it so that it's not some unknown tag.
I haven't looked through the code yet so I can't remember if it's
something I left and if it is, what it does.
I just looked, and I don't recognize it - "cvs annotate" lists it ass
being last touched by dsp_llnl ;^).
