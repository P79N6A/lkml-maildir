   I looked at the ALSA code to figure out the problem with the linux
2.2 ESS
   driver, and this is what I came up with.  I also added support for
the
   ESS1879 (which was previously unrecognized by the driver) which is
present
   in VAIO notebooks.  Additionally I enabled autodetection by default
since
   the failure of autodetection to work is less likely than the failure
of the
   driver to set the correct rate without it.  At least, that's the way
it
   seems to me.
  Those with ESS chips, please try this out.  I only tested it on my
ESS1869
  (works for 11kHz as well as 22kHz as well as 44kHz) and a friend's
ESS1879
  on his VAIO.
Cool, now with all the discussion on supporting old machines, how about
my ESS488, 8 bit mono. in an old laptop. Any advice there?
