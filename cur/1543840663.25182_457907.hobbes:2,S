You're quite right; 5% assumes perfect signal edges, which you don't
get in practice, especially at high baud rates.  Also, you have
frational stop bit tricks from some modems.
Still, as I suggested, half-precision floating point (1 sign, 5 exponent,
10 mantissa) as used for HDR graphics has a relative error range of 1/1024
(0.098%) to 1/2047 (0.049%), and would be an excellent match.
It's not a terribly serious suggestion, as I don't think 134.5 baud
is a serious issue these days, but it does make clear that there's no
difference between 115,200 baud and 115,299 baud.
