err, not that quick - but it's pretty quick.
With a kmalloc with a constant size and, preferably, a constant gfp mask
we'll jump directly into __cache_alloc() and in the common case we'll pluck
an entry directly out of the cpu-local head array:
So the kmalloc fastpath is, effectively:
	local_irq_save(save_flags);
	ac = ac_data(cachep);
	if (likely(ac->avail)) {
		ac->touched = 1;
		objp = ac_entry(ac)[--ac->avail];
	}
	local_irq_restore(save_flags);
	return objp;
Not bad...
