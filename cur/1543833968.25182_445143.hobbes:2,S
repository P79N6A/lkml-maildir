Currently most distributions have /dev/input/event* strictly as 0600
root:root or 0640 root:root. The user logged in will not have rights to
the device, unlike /dev/input/js*, as he could read all passwords from
the keyboard device.
This is a problem, because /dev/input/event* is used for force feedback
and should therefore be user-accessible.
I can think of the following solutions to this problem:
1. Some creative udev rule to chmod /dev/input/event* less strictly when
it has a /dev/input/js* and is thus a gaming device.
2. Some creative udev rule to chmod /dev/input/event* more strictly when
it is a keyboard.
3. Have another force feedback interface also in /dev/input/js*.
I prefer the first one, do you think it is a good solution or do you
have a better one?
If I go with the first one, what is the preferred way of finding out a
gaming device in udev rule?
