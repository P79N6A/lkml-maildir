There seem to be a lot of config option help screens that are crashing
"make menuconfig".
I poked around a little and found a couple more:
Under CPU Scaling Frequency, "'userspace' governer for userspace
frequency scaling" help causes a crash.
Under IO Schedulers, if you have:
                  <M> Anticipatory I/O scheduler
                  <M> Deadline I/O scheduler
                  <*> CFQ I/O scheduler
                       Default I/O scheduler (CFQ)  --->
and then select "Default I/O Scheduler (CFQ)" and then select help,
you'll get a crash.
I got another crash when I selected help for "Symmetric
multi-processing support".
It seems likely that there are loads more.
