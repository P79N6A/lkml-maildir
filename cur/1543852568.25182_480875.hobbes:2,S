After looking at this, since you have to change all of these filesystems
anyway, I'm not sure there's a lot of value in having
new_inode_autonum(); they all previously called new_inode() and then
filled in a few fields of the new inode.  Why not just call new_inode(),
and add a call to inode->i_inum = iunique(sb, 0)?  We don't have
new_inode_autouid() or new_inode_autoatime(), why is i_ino special in
this regard?
