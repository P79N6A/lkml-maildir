Any reason why you don't use a subroutine for that? It would be prettier
and most likely faster (because of the decreased L1 instruction cache
requirements)

PF_* are only used internally, so you can without make PF_* match CLONE_*
and use
        new_flags |= (clone_flags & (CLONE_PPIDOK|CLONE_WAIT));

I still think this is unnecessary...
