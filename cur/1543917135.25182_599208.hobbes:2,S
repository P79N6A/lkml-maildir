Subject: [PATCH 0/3] A kernel tracing interface - (updated)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/26/279

These patches provide a kernel tracing interface called "trace".
(update) Moved the sample code to the new samples\ subdir
The motivation for "trace" is to:
- Provide a simple set of tracing primitives that will utilize the high-
  performance and low-overhead of relayfs for passing traces data from
  kernel to user space.
- Provide a common user interface for managing kernel traces.
- Allow for binary as well as ascii trace data.
- Incorporate features from the systemtap runtime that are
  useful to others.
Patches are against 2.6.23-rc6-mm1
Summary of patches:
[patch 1/3]  Trace code and documentation
[patch 2/3]  Relay Reset Consumed
[patch 3/3]  Trace sample
Note: Patches 1/3 and 2/3 must be applied together.
Note: The following patches must be applied with 3/3.
