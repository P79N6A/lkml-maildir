Portions of it sure, but to offline the DIMM, all pages must be removed from
it. To guarantee the offlining, that means only __GFP_MOVABLE allocations
are allowed within that area and a zone is the easiest way to do it.
Now, that said, if anti-fragmentation only uses lower PFNs, the number
of active unmovable pages has to be large enough to span all DIMMs
before the offlining would fail. This problem will be hit in some
situations.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. If I wanted to offline a DIMM and I had
anti-frag (specifically the portion of it that allows a flag that affects a
whole block of pages), I would mark all the MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES blocks there
as going offline so that the pages will not be reallocated. Some time in
the future, the DIMM will be offlined but it could be an indefinte length
of time. If the DIMM consisted of just ZONE_MOVABLE, it could be offlined
in the length of time it takes to migrate all pages elsewhere or page them out.

True. It would be a bit of a hack, but it's work without needing zones.

It's needed if you want to 100% guarantee the ability to offline a DIMM under
all circumstances. However, ZONE_MOVABLE comes with it's own problems such
as not allowing kernel allocations like network buffers.
