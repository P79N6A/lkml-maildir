Assuming non-GPL and not GPL compatible (e.g. 3 clause BSD is non-GPL 
but compatible):
Unless all people holding a copyright on the GPL app agreed that this 
linking is OK, it is considered a licence violation.
That's why you often see licence statements like the following:
"In addition, as a special exception, the Free Software Foundation
gives permission to link the code of its release of Wget with the
OpenSSL project's "OpenSSL" library (or with modified versions of it
that use the same license as the "OpenSSL" library), and distribute
the linked executables.  You must obey the GNU General Public License
in all respects for all of the code used other than "OpenSSL".  If you
modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
so, delete this exception statement from your version."

Some kernel developers (and some lawyers) consider all kernel modules 
with not GPL compatible licences illegal - similar to the case of 
linking a GPL app with a non-GPL library.
Quoting Novell [1]:
"Most developers of the kernel community consider non-GPL kernel
modules to be infringing on their copyright. Novell does respect this
position, and will no longer distribute non-GPL kernel modules as part 
of future products. Novell is working with vendors to find alternative
ways to provide the functionality that was previously only available
with non-GPL kernel modules."
And considering the number of people having a copyright on parts of the 
kernel, there's noone except a court who can tell what is OK and what is 
not (and even a court decision is not binding for courts in other 
countries).

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
