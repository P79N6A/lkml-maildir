Hmm...the dependency changes I promised to make got left out during the
final git-reset/git-am/git-format-patch shuffling. This patch includes
them.

Subject: [PATCH 2/4] atmel_serial: Support AVR32
Make CONFIG_SERIAL_ATMEL selectable on AVR32 and #ifdef out some ARM-
specific code in the driver.
Also simplify the ARM dependencies a bit. This driver is usable on all
AT91 parts, and ARCH_AT91 implies ARCH_AT91RM9200 || ARCH_AT91SAM9261
as well as any future AT91 parts.
