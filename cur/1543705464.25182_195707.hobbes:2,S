Well it is a few problems that cause significant performance
regressions. But nevermind semantics...

Have a look here: 
http://www.kerneltrap.org/~npiggin/vm/3/
and here:

patches here:

and I have a couple of things which improve results even more.
True, its only kbuild, but after I do a bit more tuning I'll
focus on other things - I'm hoping most of the improvements
carry over to other cases though.
Tentatively, it looks like 2.6 under very heavy swapping can
actually be significantly improved over 2.4.

Andrew is quite well versed in the details :)
