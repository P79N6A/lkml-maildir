On a related note..
In the longer term, I'd like Jeff & I to get together and agree
upon some interface changes in libata to make it easier for this
driver (and others) to share more of the code dealing with
the emulation of non-data SCSI commands like INQUIRY and friends.
Right now that's not as easy as it could be, due to the specialized
libata struct parameters required, but I think it could be harmonized.
Cheers
