Hi,
quote from 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0207.3/0356.html
:
 " I just bought a new kouwell udma133+raid (KW-571B) card that has a
cmd680 chip on it. the card detects nicely my HDs, but after when linux
boots I get something like this:
[...]
Jul 23 18:43:28 wk kernel: hde: MAXTOR 4K080H4, ATA DISK drive
Jul 23 18:43:28 wk kernel: hdf: 00MAXTOR 4K080H4, ATA DISK drive
Jul 23 18:43:28 wk kernel: hde: host protected area => 1
Jul 23 18:43:28 wk kernel: hde: 156301488 sectors (80026 MB) w/2000KiB Cache, CHS=155061/16/63, UDMA(100)
Jul 23 18:43:28 wk kernel: hdf: task_no_data_intr: status=0x53 { DriveReady SeekComplete Index Error }
Jul 23 18:43:28 wk kernel: hdf: task_no_data_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }

 In both cases the SLAVE drive wasnt detected correctly, and after
reported errors. after I tried this out with another card from the same
brand, I tried primary and secondary channel, no luck, I got these same
sypmtoms. all drives worked perfect with promise controllers. the kernel
I used: 2.4.19-rc3-ac3. "
 I've same problem with kernel 2.4.20 on every CMD680-based card from
different manufacturers. big (eg.: Maxtor DiamondMax Plus9 - 120G) slave
drives wasn't works and detected incorrectly _until the first soft
reboot_! after that everything works fine, but not on the first boot..
 driver problem or it's works for anyone??
please cc me,
