Actually, the patch I sent you should be against the current -git tree, 
and I don't think anything has changed since -rc6 in this area.
I suspect the reason you had to hand-apply it may be the other 
test-patches you had. Can you just undo those? Since it looks like it may 
be working for you, the debug patches are just adding tons of noise by 
now, and it would be good to hear whether the status with that last patch 
is just a simple "ok, it works now".
