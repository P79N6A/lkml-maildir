man send(2):
"       ENOBUFS
	      The output queue for a network interface was full.  This
gener- ally  indicates  that the interface has stopped sending, but may
be caused by transient congestion.   (Normally,  this does  not occur
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
in Linux. Packets are just silently dropped when a device queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
overflows.)"
^^^^^^^^^^
Which is not true, because just happened to me with kernel Linux version
2.6.11-gentoo-r9.
Where should I report?
