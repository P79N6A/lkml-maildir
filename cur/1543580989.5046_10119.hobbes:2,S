In trying to apply Jens's patch I upgraded to 2.4.2-pre1.  The figures on it(242-p1) look
better at this point: a vmstat dump, same data...notice this time it only took maybe 45
seconds to write out the data.  I also got better interactive performance.
So write speed is up to about 3.5Mb/s.  Fastest reads using 'hdparm' are in the 12-14Mb/s
range.  Sooo...IDE hdparm block dev read vs. file writes...3-4:1 ratio?
I honestly have little clue as to what would be considered 'good' numbers.
Note the maximum 'system freeze' seems under 10 seconds now -- alot more 
tolerable.  
Note also, this was without my applying Jens's patch -- as I could not figure out how
to get it to apply cleanly  :-(.
