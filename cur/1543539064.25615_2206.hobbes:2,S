I still have no joystick module.  To use joystick I have to load
joystick then emu10k1-joy io=0x200 to mirror my io port and joy-analog.
I have USB in the kernel now.  Previously I used usb modules but I have
never tested my usb port.   My system is rawhide-2000704, gcc-2.95.3,
Athlon K7-700,  AMD-751 and VIA686A.
