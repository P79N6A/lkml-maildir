My experience with host-guest systems tells me the opposite:
outside traffic is a way higher than traffic between guests.
People put web server and database in different guests not more frequent than
they put them on separate physical server.
Unless people are building a really huge system when 1 server can't take the
whole load, web and database live together and benefit from communications
over UNIX sockets.
Guests are usually comprised of web-db pairs, and people place many such
guests on a single computer.

I'd like to caution about over-optimizing communications between different
network namespaces.
Many optimizations of local traffic (such as high MTU) don't look so
appealing when you start to think about live migration of namespaces.
