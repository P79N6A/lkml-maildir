It depends a lot on your architecture. On some Mac68K boxes for example
we have no full IRQ masking facility except the CPU, and level triggered
irqs. So the moment you unmask an IRQ you get the irq and you cannot drop
the IRQ level in a handler until the irq cause is cleared.
It makes it umm.. fun
