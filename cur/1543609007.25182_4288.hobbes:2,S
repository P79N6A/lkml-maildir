As these threads show, this is a big argument, involving:
1) What should the in-kernel interface look like?
2) What should the userspace interface look like?
3) Should there be a sysctl interface overlap?
I'm trying to nail down (1).  Whether there is a new backwards
compatible sysctl() which takes a name instead of a number, and/or
whether the whole thing should be done in userspace, I am not going
to address.
Rusty.
