Did you notice my comment? When I sent that message I'd been awake for nearly 
24 hours helping a friend through depression and was ready to fall asleep 
while checking my email. I have since read it and I understand your problem. 
That documentation does state, however, that the HAL system is normally 
accessed via the dbus system message bus. In order to help you with that 
facet of things here is a link to the dbus documentation: 
http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html
And I will look into the HAL source code and provided headers to see if I 
cannot find you a direct interface such as dbus has with HAL. But not at the 
current moment, as I am limited in my available time.

Huh? I understood HAL in less than ten minutes from that specification. But 
then, any competant programmer would spend a great deal more time on learning 
an interface. I have been studying the ATAPI, SCSI and MMC specs for more 
than six months now and, while I have a firm grasp of the concepts, could not 
sit down and write a piece of software that spoke those protocols. (This is 
mainly because I haven't been focusing on them, but rather referencing in 
passing after having read them in their entirety at least once)
