They aren't stable with it,too :(
Kernel 2.2.13 with ext3fs patch.
Wanted to switch back to 2.3.23 that worked fine for me,but it doesn't
have ext3fs support :(
UDMA66 works with 2.3.23,but I was unable to see any improvement in
speed.(I have Quantum Fireball KA Plus)
Any ideas about having ext3fs under 2.3.x?
