It must also be running in a way that it cannot trigger a bug in existing
kernel code, otherwise we have binaries triggering stuff that we cannot
debug. That is what makes it hard.
If netscape Oopses the kernel as a user then I know we screwed up, because
we have a defined interface and it wasnt running as root. A driver is
totally different, it might causes oopses, application funnies - anything
and anywhere in the kernel.
