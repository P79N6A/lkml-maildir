I'd like to invalidate/free the filesystem caches and io buffer cache
How can I do this when I can't unmount the filesystem (and w/o reboot) ?
(I run filesystem I/O test that needs to  start from fresh  cache &
buffer state -- as emty as possible, like right after mount/boot).
I tried  'mount -o remount' but it didn't make any difference
on the timing. Apparently 'mount -o remount' did not invalidate
cases/buffers ? ( The difference between fresh run vs non-fresh
run timing is x5 times ).
Thanks
Yakov
