Short answer:
A warning is logged and num_ports defaults to 2.
Long answer:
Unfortunately, it does not apear that this class of device sends any kind of
connect info back in repsonse to VISOR_GET_CONNECTION_INFORMATION,
PALM_GET_EXT_CONNECTION_INFORMATION, or for that matter any request under
200 (or some similiar number - I don't remember how far I tested).
Based upon a usb packet capture under windoze, I believe that the device
is not capable of this.  I'd really like some kind of documentation on
the connection protocol, but I've come up completely empty handed in that
regard.
The packet capture available at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=2924&action=view
 shows the
attempt to send both VISOR_GET_CONNECTION_INFORMATION (3) and 
PALM_GET_EXT_CONNECTION_INFORMATION (4) requests.  Both times nothing is
returned.
In any case, when no valid connection info is found, num_ports is initially
set to 0, a warning is logged, and num_ports defaults to 2.
