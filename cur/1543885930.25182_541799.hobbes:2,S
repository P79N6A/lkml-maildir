Complete agreement with one nitbit: there is not "be64" type defined as
of yet.
And in the current patch there is no userspace/kernelspace boundary
either, as both mkfs and fsck live in kernelspace.  When changing this I
will use __be64 and friends in the common header.
The remaining question is how to deal with kernel-only code that uses
be64.  Convert that to __be64 as well?  Or introduce be64 in
include/linix/types.h instead?

Trust me, I'm happy there is no beint64_t.  So enough of that.
