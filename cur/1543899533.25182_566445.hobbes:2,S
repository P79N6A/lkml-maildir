The changelogs would be more useful if they were indexed by google, but
it seems they aren't (maybe too big, since 2.4 and 2.6.16 changelogs are
indexed ?). At least having the shortlog available would be a minimum,
provided that we try to keep the most possible descriptive subjects.
This also means being more transparent about security fixes.
