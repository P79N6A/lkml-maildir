Hmm.  I've had it running *hard* for two years, never seen a single oops
or glitch of any sort, kernels 2.4.0-test1 through 2.4.18.  O(1),
preempt, low-latency all on at various times.  All static images though,
with no pass-through.

Heh, no prob.  The most recent version might have fixed it, although the
last time I tried TUX2 I got a hard hang... prolly O(1) but I never had
time to narrow it down.

Odd, seems identical to my standard traffic, though my images are in the
4-64k range.  What you're seeing seems to be an interaction problem --
something different in the non-mainstream, non-x86 kernel that's
allowing khttpd to hang itself.  No argument that khttpd is frightening.

Yeah, good luck tracking down X15.  I've wanted to create a
heavily-modified apache MPM, but my time is unfortunately finite...
Apache2 on top of TUX2 would be ideal, but alas neither is quite
prime-time yet.
