I think this is a _very weak_  reason.
Without addressing any of your other arguements, can you describe what
such painful overhead you are talking about? Did you do any measurements
and under what circumstances are unix sockets vs say localhost bound
udp sockets are different? I am not looking for hand waving reason of
"but theres an IP stack".
