At 114 megabits/second, we pass the mrtg threshold of an overflow within 5
minutes. A 1 gigabit link will do this once every 34 seconds. There are 10
gigabit adaptors out there which may need to be polled once every 3 seconds
then.

Pretty good is not however. Can't we do what we do for jiffies where we only
do a 64 bit operation very seldomly?
