They are debug warnings, not oopses.

airo_get_stats is called under the read_lock(&dev_base_lock); which was
taken in dev_get_info.  So it may not call sleeping functions (ie:
down_interruptible()).
It would appear that no netdevice->get_stats() method is allowed to sleep,
which seems pretty dumb, IMVHO.
