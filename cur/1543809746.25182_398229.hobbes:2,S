Subject: [PATCH: 012/012] Memory hotplug for new nodes v.2 (allow -EEXIST of add_memory)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/17/96

When acpi_memory_device_init() is called at boottime to
register struct memory acpi_memory_device. So, 
acpi_bus_add() are called via acpi_driver_attach().
But it also calls ops->start() function.
It is called even if the memory blocks are initialized at
early boottime. In this case add_memory() return -EEXIST, and
the memory blocks becomes INVALID state even if it is normal.
This is patch for it.
