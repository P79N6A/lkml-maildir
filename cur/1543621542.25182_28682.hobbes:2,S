Rmap version 11c is considered ready for use.
For rmap 12, which is also ready for use, I have added the
feature of RSS limit enforcement.
Rmap version 13 will get new page launder features.
It seems from now on -rmap will get new features, but no
more changes to the -rmap architecture are needed right
now.

I've started pushing some trivial stuff for inclusion into
2.5, but unfortunately current 2.5 just won't boot on my
test box so I cannot test it (either with or without the
patch).
Once 2.5 is working on my test box, I'll be ready to merge
some of the larger stuff ...
... I'll try to push things to Linus in small parts, so
nothing will break in the process.

Good to hear I've got happy users.
cheers,
