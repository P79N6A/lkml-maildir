Could user acahalan send 42 bytes to user mmuscovi?
Even if that works, you have an ugly signal handler that
can't call many functions in libc. This is poor.

I believe he means "true" capability support. In any case,
Linux can't revoke normal user capabilities.

This limits concurrency. Within the kernel, IO events need not be
serialized. User-space can only get this ability with threads.
Threads are quite a bit of overhead for such a simple need, plus
the use of threads tends to promote bugs.
Good solutions cover more than just IO.

It is not good to return to userspace, loop around, and make the system
call a second time. The overhead and app code complexity are annoying.

Hmmm, there was a security concern mentioned. To me though, this looks
more like an implementation detail that would get in the way of
concurrent system calls.
