I have an imbeded system which runs in real RAM, booted off a NVRAM
ram-disk. It does everything its supposed to do including TCP/IP.
So I know it should work. Normally, embeded systems do not execute
out of ROM because it's much slower. Further, how did you get an
executable image into ROM? This seems like a very difficult way
of doing it.
Anyway, many ROM modules can't do byte access. The designers allow
word access only. This will mess up instruction flow with Intel
machines since they have a varible-length instruction set and can
execute off from odd addresses.
My NVRAM machine has 32 64k pages of ROM that has page 0 mapped into
the 0xd000:0 segment, seen during POST. It has the header and is
properly checksummed so that POST calls offset 3 (another odd address)
and my code gets control. It installs it self as a RAM disk, in place
of a floppy, then returns.
When the machine starts to boot, my RAM disk driver emulates a floppy,
properly switching pages as required so that LILO thinks it's a normal
floppy. LILO loads the image, which also contains a RAM Disk which is
mounted as root. I have a program that substitutes for init, which
loads other executables and drivers as required, and starts the
network. The result is a Linux Operating System with application software
that does communications and control via TCP/IP, GPIB, RS-232C, and
firewire (all things to all people). Installable modules talk to devices
on a VXI bus.
Parameters are saved in the last page of NVRAM. They are restored on
the next boot.

This all works and is the method of making embeded systems that I
advise. The system uses only one stick of RAM (4 megabytes). The
RAM disk (mounted as root) is 1440 kB. The executables all use
about 4 kB of RAM and I use shared libraries which are stripped.
The "SHOW STATUS" above is a homemade version of 'ps', made really
small. It shows the tasks that normally execute. 
If you are executing anything but boot code out of ROM, I think it's
a poor approach. With the approach cited here, you can grow the system
during the product's lifetime. This is often essential because early
in the development process, few can see far enough into the future
to make initial designs that will handle developing markets.
If you need some hints (and even some code), contact me off-the-list.
Linux makes great embeded systems if you do it right.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
