Hi
I was wondering if it was possible to add -march=native support to the
processor options of the new x86 architecture if gcc 4.2 or greater is being
used.
I'm not suggesting this should be a default at all, merely an extra option
similar to selecting P4, Athlon or even -Os.
I've manually tried this flag at home with no ill effects.
Mike
