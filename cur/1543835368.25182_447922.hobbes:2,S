That's still an extra level of indirection. You have to use the nice
GUI to create a new /dev/something, and then point your at at dev
/dev/something. And you have to be root to do that, whereas some sysfs
stuff is world-readable.

Is sysfs supposed to be a private" API that only "special services
services" look at? It has definitely failed in this respect -- It's
just too convenient and attractive. I'm not sure that's a bad thing...
Given the current usage pattern of sysfs, is it still a bad idea for
it to carry device inodes?
