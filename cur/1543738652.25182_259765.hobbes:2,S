Hi Trond!
experiencing the following panic on a linux-vserver
kernel (2.6.9-rc4, no modifications to locking)
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempting to free lock with active block list
it's not easy to trigger but it happens now and then.
after adding a dump_stack() in panic() this is the trace
[<8011b945>] panic+0x55/0xe0		       
[<80174897>] fcntl_setlk64+0x137/0x2d0         
[<80119540>] autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0x60 
[<80179aba>] dnotify_parent+0x3a/0xb0	       
[<8015dc49>] fget+0x49/0x60		       
[<8016fa5b>] sys_fcntl64+0x4b/0xa0	       
[<8010426f>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
it's the locks_free_lock(file_lock); at the end of 
fcntl_setlk64() and I'm asking myself if something
like in sys_flock()
        if (list_empty(&lock->fl_link)) {
                locks_free_lock(lock);
        }
would help here or just paper over the real issue?
TIA,
Herbert
