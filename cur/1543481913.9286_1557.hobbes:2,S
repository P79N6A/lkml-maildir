Well, I have an i486dx4/75 based notebook with 12M of RAM, and I can
report that 2.2.0-pre9 works fine on it in console mode, with the one
exception that the PCMCIA subsystem doesn't appear to work, so I can't
use my PCMCIA network adapter with it...
I can't yet report on using it with XFree86 since there's not enough
space on the hard drive to install that, but I'm hoping to upgrade the
hard drive to a 3.5G or larger drive late next week...
Best wishes from Riley.
