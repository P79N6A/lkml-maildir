The kernel changes. A lot. And often.
With that in mind, if (for example) A2 and A3 are simple changes that
are quick to test and B1 is large, or complex, or requires hours (days,
weeks) of testing to validate, then a maintainer's decision can
legitimately be to rebase a tree (say, -mm) upon the B1 line of
development, and toss the A2 branch back to those developers with a
"Sorry it didn't work out, something here causes Unhappiness with B1,
can you track down the problem and try again?"
