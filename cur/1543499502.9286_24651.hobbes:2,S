But it makes it easy to estimate how the size of the hashtable will be.
Especially when testing dozens of _hashfn's it's nice to have a
BUF_MEAN_BUFFERS_PER_BUCKET (MBPB). You can simply vary it from 1 to 8
and note down the results. With your patch it get's kind of "shift 11",
"shift 12" or "shift 10" which is not very descriptive. Using different
block sizes makes the results of all current methods bogus anyway.
Anyway... Chuck, did my last mail reach you? It seems some of my latest
mails went to nowhere. According to my benchmarks with various hash
table sizes (1, 2, 4 and 8) a shift value of 6 is about 3-6% faster
than the '>>bh_hash_bits' hashfn in the raw cache performance (du
test).
Typical distribution with >>10 - >>15 (including >>bh_hash_bits), MBPB=2:
Buffer hashed: 14718
 Bucket size : empty     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8  >=9
