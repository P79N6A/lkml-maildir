Stephen, read the whole paragraph, I covered that ;) 
Even POSIX got that (pthread_sigmask), just you additionally want a global 
masking to make signals useful (otherwise lots of programs have to invent 
their own signal locking). In the kernel it could be done without too
much pain (first check thread local mask and then check shared mask in
signal_struct)

It would be of course be optional, I agree that it makes a lot of sense
for programs to not share credentials between threads if they wish so. It 
is just broken for an POSIX Threads environment, because it silently 
introduces security holes into ported software.

I just have a hard time imagining a sane way to do it in user space.
Do you have a good idea how it would work?
