Subject: [PATCH 2/4] ACPI C-States: bm_activity handling improvement
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Only if bus master activity is going on at the present, we should
avoid entering C3-type sleep, as it might be a faulty transition. As long
as the bm_activity bitmask was based on the number of calls to the ACPI
idle function, looking at previous moments made sense. Now, with it being
based on what happened this jiffy, looking at this jiffy should be
sufficient.
