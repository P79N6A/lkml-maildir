Agreed.

Yes, you are.

Nope. In fact, "work based on the program" is so unclear that it means that if 
I wrote a book about the creation of the Linux Kernel that is entirely 
original - containing nothing that is copyright someone else - I would have 
to release it under the GPL simply because it is a "work based on the 
program".
Is it okay to make that demand? I don't think so. But that is *exactly* what 
it means. And it is "the GPL applying itself to works which would normally be 
considered independent and separate works in themselves".
