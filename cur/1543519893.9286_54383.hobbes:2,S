gsc_(read|write)[bwl] is what we currently use.
A rather different problem is how to access two PCI busses in one system, one
of which has its MMIO space directly mapped into PA IO space, the other needs 
o be accessed using separate address/data registers (though DMA should work
fine on both).

NCR53C710 (SCSI), 82596 (ethernet), NS16550A clone is what we know of so far.

That would only work if either the driver wouldn't export any symbols or it
would be loaded as module, wouldn't it ?
