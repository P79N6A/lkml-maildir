Dear Kernel developers,
I've been testing kernel 2.6.0test9 on QuadXeon w HT with 3WARE RAID10
(8 drives)
On the IO stress test I found a lot of following messages in dmesg, I'm
not sure what do they mean and how to get rid of them:
Badness in as_completed_request at drivers/block/as-iosched.c:919
Call Trace:

Please let me know which additional information I need to provide, in
order to help to track down this issue.
I've also seen some serve performance degradation issues compared to 2.4
but as they might be related to this issue, I'll do more tests before
reporting them.
