The original poster was probably refering to smaller memory footprint
instead of speed. In an embedded system where flash memory is expensive, a
large webserver is overkill. But there are smaller servers for that, like
boa, which is about 40 kb object code. You need the appropriate functions
from libc as well of course, but you probably need those anyway.
I've used both an in-kernel http server and boa for an embedded system and
boa was much cleaner.
