Your patch appears to be whitespace-damaged.  Please configure your
mailer appropriately.
Also, please stick to the patch format described here:

In particular, don't put anything in the message that doesn't belong
in the kernel's changelog, such as email-ish messages.

I agree w/ Adrian.  Since you are touching it, please put something
appropriate in the Kconfig file.  Zhu Yi may be able to help if you
aren't sure what the help text should say.
