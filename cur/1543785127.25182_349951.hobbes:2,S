I think, therefore, I've made the point that you could have used
scsi_scan_target() but chose not to for ideological rather than
technical reasons.
Writing code which duplicates existing mid-layer functionality is what
I've been telling you all along isn't acceptable.  Use what exists to
day and if it doesn't work quite right, fix it.  If you want to alter an
interface, we need to evolve towards it keeping all the current users
working.
Now, I can merge your transport class with Christoph's (or find someone
else to do it for me) by converting it to use the existing mid-layer and
transport class infrastructure (I think, actually, it will look rather
nice after this and probably reduce in size by about 50%) but I'd much
rather that you did it.
The unified transport class should be capable of supporting both the
aic94xx SAS card using your existing domain device interface as well as
the fusion SAS card, which is the whole goal of all of this in the first
place.
So, do you want to do this work, or would you rather just be responsible
for the aic94xx driver?
