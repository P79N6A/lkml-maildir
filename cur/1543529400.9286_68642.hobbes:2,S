I just re-checked source code in 2.3.51 and AFAICT it is not possible
to have any of those messages generated with debugging disabled
as whole debugging stuff is "#ifdef CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG".
Are you sure you *disabled* it? The most sure way to do it it is
(form linux dir)
	cp .config ..
	make distclean
	cp ../.config .
	make oldconfig
	make dep
	make bzImage
	make modules
