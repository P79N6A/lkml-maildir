What makes you think Pavel was talking about semantics?!
The point was that:
Ok, there is a strong disagreement about these two lines. Could we have
a patch with everything but these two lines, so it can be integrated
immediately to profit of the testing and generally be useful, and then
the controversial bits when the issue is beaten to death?
So, please, could you send a stripped-down version, that is not safe for
mounting by users, but can be tested for many cases where that is
sufficient?

now they just have enough of those hacks and want a cleaner solution.
