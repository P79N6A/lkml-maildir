k<insert name>d works too.  all part of mtnc from the author.  easily part
of linux/scripts/ just like several other things.
devfs if needed can be precisely like quotas or devfs can be like kdevfsd.
my use of it has the impact that i put a chmod/chown/ln in my rc.whatever
1/2 a year ago for a driver that wasn't updated.  i don't do anything else.
