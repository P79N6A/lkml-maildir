I don't think that's an option.
Consider the question of whether non-GPL kernel modules are legal at 
all and the number and different opinions of Linux kernel authors.
Plus the general question whether any "upgrade the license" would be 
valid in all jurisdictions ("GPL version 2 or any later version"  
as licence might make it possible, but in all other cases I'd have 
serious doubts).
