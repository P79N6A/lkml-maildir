Subject: RFC: removing the dgrs net driver

Based on the information in the email forwarded below I'd remove the 
dgrs net driver (this wasn't the first driver shipped with the kernel 
without any hardware ever produced...).
Is this OK or is there any doubt whether this information is true?

Subject: Please remove useless dgrs driver
An official email from digi.com to Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>
explained:
 Dear Andres:
 After further research, we found that this product was killed in place
 and never reached the market.  We would like to request that this not be
 included.
Copy at 
http://wiki.debian.org/KernelFirmwareLicensing
 (this was discovered
during research into firmware licensing).
The drgs driver is useless (no hardware to drive) and should be removed.
The files which should be deleted from the tree are:
        drivers/net/dgrs.c
        drivers/net/dgrs.h
        drivers/net/dgrs_es4h.h
        drivers/net/dgrs_plx9060.h
        drivers/net/dgrs_i82596.h
        drivers/net/dgrs_ether.h
        drivers/net/dgrs_asstruct.h
        drivers/net/dgrs_bcomm.h
        drivers/net/dgrs_firmware.c
It will probably also be necessary to delete some stuff from drivers/net/Kconfig
and drivers/net/Makefile, but I assume that this will be trivial for any
net maintainer.
Thanks in advance for doing this.
