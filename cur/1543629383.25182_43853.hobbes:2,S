So the kernel page tables are carrying what I'd call a logical address,
that is, zero-based, indexing your logical-to-physical table (physical
taken in a non-literal sense).
This would suggest that your current arrangement is a strict subset of
my current config_nonlinear design, flat table and all, but with
phys_to_pagenum defined as a compile-time error.
