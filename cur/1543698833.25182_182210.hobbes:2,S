Hello,
after switching to 2.6.0-test10 using acpi, I'm experiencing strange 
sound artefacts when
playing music on my Sony-notebook using the alsa intel8x0-driver. Whereas it
all works ok and I don't get any error messages, sound playback seems to
slow down or speed up occasionally, i.e. an mp3 file plays normally, then it
sounds as if the frequency goes up resulting in a higher-pitched voice 
etc., then
I get strange noises, then it works again as expected. This is not 
dependant to the
used output (alsa/OSSemu). I also disabled the cpufreq option, which didn't
change much. The problem didn't exist in 2.4.x where the alsa driver 
worked flawlessly;
I didn't update to -test11 as I didn't see any related changes.
I include some system info:
00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM AC'97 Audio 
Controller (rev 02)
   Subsystem: Sony Corporation: Unknown device 80fa
   Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 9
   I/O ports at 1c00 [size=256]
   I/O ports at 18c0 [size=64]
The only relevant kernel messages (as far as I get tell):

I can supply further information if needed.
