Just to go a little bit more in that direction, I already have seen an 
obvious one-line patch that caused a deadlock in another OS because due 
to code location change and probably an additionnal cache miss on 
specific part of the code, an existing synchronisation bug that was 
never triggered started to effectively happen...
Besides, if you please 1000 users and cause problem to 2 of them because 
they have broken hardware, I think you are going into the right direction.

Bug fixes are meant to make the 2.4 kernel more useable right? So I do 
not reallly see the utimate difference with other things in your 
category. What I was asking is a rationnal way of chosing the 
priorities. You gave me yours without real explanation.
The purpose of the original mail was to ask for discussion/clarification 
on 2.4 development priorities (e.g something like the 2.6 todo list) and 
a proposal to set up the priorities using generic targetted hardware 
(server, laptop, desktop) as hint for requirement selection.
