There was a nice thread on one of the freebsd lists last
week. They calculated that a 1TB fileserver would cost
somewhere between $3000 and $12000, depending on how much
performance you want (and whether you'd like hot-plugging
of drives or not).
With this kind of cost (and dropping all the time), it is
indeed a very realistic thing that people /will/ be using
multi-TB disk arrays on 32-bit machines without wanting to
upgrade to a 64-bit machine for this ...
regards,
Rik
