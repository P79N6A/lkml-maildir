Subject: applying patches to running kernels

I have created a patch which protects against the suid & ptrace
problem.  The patch is a kernel module which you can load into a running
kernel without the need to reboot.
It is just a concept at the moment (although it appears to work) but I
hope that it might sparc some intrest in a project devoted to simalar
kinds of 'hot' fixes.
The module code and short description can be found here
