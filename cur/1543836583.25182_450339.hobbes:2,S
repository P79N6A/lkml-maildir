Since the output from the clocksource is a lowlevel timestamp I don't
think the users of it would want it to be ntp adjusted. It would also be
a little odd, since the ntp adjustment would be attached only to a
single clock.

I imagine the users of the interface would be compartmentalized. Taking
sched_clock as an example the output is only compared to itself and not
to output from other interfaces.

Part of the reason to have a generic sched_clock() (and the generic
clocksource interface in general) is to eliminate the inefficienty of
duplicating shift and mult functionality in each arch (and on ARM it's
per board). So if you correctly implement a clocksource structure for
your hardware you will at least expose a usable sched_clock() and
generic timeofday. Then if we add more users of the interface then more
functionality is exposed.
Another instances of this is when instrumentation is needing a of fast
low level timestamp. In the past to accomplish this one would need a per
arch change to read a clock, then potentially duplicate a shift and mult
type computation in order to covert to nanosecond. One good example of
this is latency tracing in the -rt tree. I can imagine some good and
valid instrumentation having a long road of acceptable because the time
stamping portion would need to flow through several different arch and
potentially board maintainers.
I've also imagined that some usage of jiffies could be converted to use
this interface if it was appropriate. Since jiffies is hooked to the
tick, and the tick is getting more and more irregular, a clocksource
might be a relatively good replacement.

I've converted latency tracing to an earlier version of the API , but I
don't have any other examples prepared. I think it's important to get
the API settled before I start converting anything else.
