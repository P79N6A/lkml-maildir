Yes, that's correct. The code related to the patch i sent in starts 
around line 114 of drivers/pci/quirks.c in 2.6.18:
/*
 *      VIA Apollo KT133 needs PCI latency patch
 *      Made according to a windows driver based patch by George E. Breese
 *      see PCI Latency Adjust on 
http://www.viahardware.com/download/viatweak.shtm
 *      Also see 
http://www.au-ja.org/review-kt133a-1-en.phtml
 for
 *      the info on which Mr Breese based his work.
 *
 *      Updated based on further information from the site and also on
 *      information provided by VIA
 */
static void __devinit quirk_vialatency(struct pci_dev *dev)

However i will be happy to test anything that would also fix my problem 
and replaces my patch. :)
