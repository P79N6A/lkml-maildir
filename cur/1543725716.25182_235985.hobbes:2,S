No, we want to give an interface that matches the sort of provider URI
used by object systems such as CORBA, D-BUS, and DCOP.  We also do _not_
want to put policy in the kernel.
The easiest way to avoid that is simply to use a name similar to the
path name.
Passing the sysfs name would probably be a good potential argument to
the signal, though.  The temperature signal in the patch is just an
example.

That sounds like policy to me.
Especially if drivers start using this for error logging, there are no
ties to sysfs.  Configuration dependencies tend to be hard build-time
deps anyhow.
