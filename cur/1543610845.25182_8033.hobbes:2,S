I'd tend to agree there. The new VM would have gone into 2.5.x and then back
into 2.4
In terms of release cycles there is a better method, that is simply to
codify what already happens. In truth we have yearly major releases
We went
	1.2
	1.3.59
	2.0
	2.0.30
	2.2
	2.2.14-18 merge cycle
	2.4
What we possibly should do is admit the backport phases (2.0.30/2.2.14/...)
do in fact occur and go
	2.5
	2.5 seems kind of solid at some random point but not finished
	2.6 (2.4 + 2.5 and useful bit driver backport)
	2.7 (continued 2.5)
	2.8 (actual release containing the grand changes 2.5 started)
