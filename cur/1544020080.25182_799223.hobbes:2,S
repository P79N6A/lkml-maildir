This message certainly made it to my mailbox via the list.
I can also see this mail at sites that archive the list:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/29/198
http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0901.3/01947.html
So no, you are certainly not being censored.
If you don't get your mails yourself it could be that you are not 
subscribed to the list.
