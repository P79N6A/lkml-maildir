Well. I chose the most elegant solution I saw.
If you see a better solution, I would like to see it.
Note that local symbols in several files determine
whether this function should be compiled or not.
Also, consider the following.
This file *is* a library. It contains a hundred
(in the version you saw half a dozen) one-line
static inline functions. That is the real library.
It describes all identify stuff.
And there is a single large function used for debugging,
invisible unless a debugging symbol is defined.
I cannot see anything wrong with that.
You are very narrow minded if you are blinded by the
fact that the name ends in an h.
