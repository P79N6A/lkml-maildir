I had no success with it:
/usr/src/setarch-1.7/setarch i386 -R /pliant/fullpliant
I even tried adding the following instruction at the very beginning of my
C program, with no more success:
personality(0x0040000); // ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE
Basically, the behaviour is not changed, as opposed to if I do:

If I replace
  PROT_NONE,MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS,-1,0
with
  PROT_NONE,MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_FIXED,-1,0
the call just fails.
