Do we ever use the "register" keyword anymore?  I don't make "suggestions" to 
gcc, I hit it with a clue-by-by four.

I'd be happy to just figure out what the policy is.  It seems like 
the "inline" keyword should no longer be used, and either say __always_inline 
or leave it to the compiler.  If there's a good counter-argument, I'd love to 
hear it.
