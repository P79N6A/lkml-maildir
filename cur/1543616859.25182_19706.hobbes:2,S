Hi,
Finally I got the my system back to 2.4.12-ac3-ll level latencies and
smoothness and it's in fact performing significantly better.
See 
http://www.pp.song.fi/~visitor/latencytest5/3x256.html
 for latency
results. (Sound driver is OSS 3.9.5f)
Patches used against 2.4.17 are:
 - Andre's IDE patch
 - Rik's rmap-11b
 - Ingo's O(1)-H6
 - Andrew's full lowlatency
 - My additions to lowlatency
Now I'm quite happy with this!
