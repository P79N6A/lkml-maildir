Do you really think so? Yes, there are possibly LKML bots, that will
read all messages in every thread. But i doubt they are humans.
I also think, that kill-files and kill-names are common tools of the LKML
readers. Thus, if someone sees my name with something like NAK in the
subject, then nothing to worry about: next, please. I just amazed how
inefficiently Subject, To, Cc headers are used. Everybody hurry through
huge mail backlogs with subjects in thread all like one.
Summary and keywords headers are not used, so why not to make
greping/selecting interesting/useful messages more efficient (and not
only for those who is in Cc list)?
Every mail/news reader displays To and Subject, so latter is last hope of
increasing of efficiency, even in small threads.

Sorry, i cannot see, what you are trying to say here. To place all
acks-by to subject? No, just to get summary in one particular reply.
