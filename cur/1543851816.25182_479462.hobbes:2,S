and this is why it's wrong to make naming policy a kernel thing!
Userspace is the right place to do this (and there I suspect the name
will end up being /dev/cdrom)...... the kernel really shouldn't care at
all what the name is.
(I know for root= it currently has to if you don't have an initrd but..
well... that's sort of a nasty interface anyway; what if you have a usb
cdrom drive connected for example.. suddenly all your names changed)
