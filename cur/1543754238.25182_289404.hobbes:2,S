Some data collected using VMware 4.5.2 (with Petr's patch 89) which maybe
can help track down the memory problem. This is with 2.6.11-rc2-bk2. Took
little over an hour for the system to start moving into swap.
Attached gzipped tar file contains 11 files.
log which is output of vmstat -a 600
meminfo1 thru 5
slabinfo 1 thru 5
  1 is prior to starting a VMware guest, short after a fresh boot. 
  2 is just after starting a VMware guest. Guest has 128MB assigned.
  3 is just after system start to show swap usage. System never normally
    requires any swap.
  4 is just prior to exiting the VMware guest.
  5 is after VMware guest closed out.
