Hi!
I'm seeing strange thing on hp omnibook... I work on console, and
machine suddenly locks up without me doing anything strange. So I
press powerbutton for a short while, and ... machine continues to work
as if nothing happened. Not even keyboard presses are lost.
But its annoying, anyway. 2.4.14-acpi. Happened ~10 times so
far. Anyone seen something similar?
