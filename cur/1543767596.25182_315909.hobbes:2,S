More or less yes.  As you're finding out, it's very difficult to build a 
functioning 2.6 kernel that fits the size requirements of the zImage 
format.  Really, the zImage format is not needed anymore.  It was only 
kept around because a small number of ancient BIOSes failed to load the 
bzImage format with the now defunct floppy boot block.  There is no size 
difference in the resulting zImage or bzImage, only the load address is 
different.
