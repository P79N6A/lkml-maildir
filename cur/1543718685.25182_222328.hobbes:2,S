(1) describes that in more detail than "pte_chains going away". It's
just a search algorithm. For anonymous pages, anon_vma just strobes
offsets into vma inheritance chains, and anonmm just strobes vaddrs in
all forks between execs, for file-backed memory they both use ->i_mmap.
Yes, they can both be summarized in the same sentence. The scope of the
changes are very limited and the presentation of them is a very clearly
documented and incremental series of small changes.
