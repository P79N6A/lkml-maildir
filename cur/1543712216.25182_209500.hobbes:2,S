Same with WAV and PNG files distributed with many GPL packages. It is
widely accepted method to distribute files that do not need modification
without their "source" (whatever source is used to create them).

Write a firmware loader that extracts it from the Windows DLLs. Such
things happened in the past and work AFAIK quite good.

Imagine, there is a bug in the firmware. Normaly, you would have to boot
windows or DOS to run a flash tool to install it into the device. Here
you just replace the DLL.

The user gets the driver CD when he buys the hardware.
