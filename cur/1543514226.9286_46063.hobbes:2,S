  Hi, all. Version 130 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
NOTE: this is the first patch which removes compatibility entries (as
required by Linus). If you need the compatibility entries, install
devfsd-v1.2.5 which will create them automatically if you ask.
This is against 2.3.22-pre1. Highlights of this release:
- Added major and minor number to devfsd protocol
- Incremented devfsd protocol revision to 5
- Removed compatibility entries for SoundBlaster CD-ROMs
- Removed compatibility entries for netlink devices
- Removed compatibility entries for SCSI generic devices
- Removed compatibility entries for SCSI tape devices
				Regards,
					Richard....
