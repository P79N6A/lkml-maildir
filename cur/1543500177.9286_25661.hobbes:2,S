Hi,
The reason why the original kernel is failing is probably because when you
edited /etc/lilo.conf you broke the structure of association of "root="
and "image=".
The reason why 2.3.6 does not boot is well known - it is a bug. Use 2.3.8.
The reason why your boot floppy does not mount root filesystem is because
it does not have a driver for the scsi controller.
The ways to recover from it is to pass "root=/dev/sdb1" to your old
kernel, i.e. at LILO prompt:
LILO: linux1 root=/dev/sdb1
Regards,
