It's a kernel coding standard to _not_ explicitly initialise
static-extent data to zero.

This conditional looks terribly obscure.
Can you simplify it or explain your intention here?

You're invoking release_lapic_nmi() in response to user
input, without having verified that _you_ had done a
reserve_lapic_nmi() before.
It looks like the code will do horrible things if the
operator invokes the sysctl incorrectly. Such errors do
happen, so code should include basic sanity checks.
