Perhaps, before pontificating on the needs of `real users,' you should try
talking to some of them.  Many of the arts students I know use TeX and LaTeX
regularly.  And store their compund documents in directories.
For that matter, all the designers and design students I know use
directories to store their compount documents, even on systems that support
streamed filesystems.
Poke your head outside linux-kernel sometime.  It could be enlightening for
you.
