It is right.
hwif->addressing means hwif supports 48-bit
hwif->rqsize means max rq size for _hwif_

And?
Even if !drive->addressing, hwif->addressing can be 1,
so hwif->rqsize can be 65536.

Patch still misses pdx202xx_old.c changes :-).
Two new ones:
- rq_lba48(rq) should check for rq->hard_* values
- after some thought, drop _all_ changes to ide_dump_status()
  (we may hit error when rq->nr_sectors is already < 256)
