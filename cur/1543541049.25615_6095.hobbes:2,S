  You misunderstood me a bit. There isn't problem with struct dquot..
The problem is when somebody does chgrp or chown on some file. Then
the function just gets inode and you need to substract space used by
file from quota of previous owner and add it to quota of new owner.
But currently there is *no* way how to get space used by file in bytes.
Only blocks are available in i_blocks but that is not usable for reiserfs.

  OK. I took a bit different approach but generally with the same
results :-). Anyway thanks for ideas. I'll think about them.
