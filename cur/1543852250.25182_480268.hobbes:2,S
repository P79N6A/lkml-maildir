It protects against irq handler also. 
drivers/scsi/NCR53C9x.c:
irqreturn_t esp_intr(int irq, void *dev_id)
{
    struct NCR_ESP *esp;
    unsigned long flags;
    int again;
    struct Scsi_Host *dev = dev_id;
    /* Handle all ESP interrupts showing at this IRQ level. */
    spin_lock_irqsave(dev->host_lock, flags);
...
...
