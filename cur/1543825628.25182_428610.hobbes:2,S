In theory practice and theory are the same, but in practice they are
different.
Current simple XOR hash used in socket selection code is just bloody good!
Jenkins hash unfortunately has _significant_ artefacts which were found
in netchannel [1] hash selection analysis [2].
And Jenkins hash is far too slower.
1. Netchannel.

2. Compared Jenkins hash with XOR hash used in TCP socket selection
code.
