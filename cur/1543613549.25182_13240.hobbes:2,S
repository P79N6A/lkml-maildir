Try again, this time adding "srmcons" to the boot flags.  You're croaking
before we get the console set up under Linux so none of the boot messages are
getting out; srmcons uses the SRM console to print its messages.  This won't
fix the bugs, but at least we'll be able to see exactly where you die.
