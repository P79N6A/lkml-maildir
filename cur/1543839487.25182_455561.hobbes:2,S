Hi Shailabh,
Michal was running some kmemleak tests and there are about 20 orphan
pointers reported in delayacct.c. The allocation backtrace is:
orphan pointer 0xf548fde0 (size 76):
  c0174674: <kmem_cache_zalloc>
  c01591ee: <__delayacct_tsk_init>
  c0127e06: <copy_process>
  c0128cd2: <do_fork>
  c0104d39: <sys_clone>
I'm not sure whether the leak occurs but there might be a path where
task_struct is freed and the task->delays pointer is lost. Could you
please have a look at this? Thanks.
