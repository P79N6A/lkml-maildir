Turn?  Just what stops you from getting a negative (and unhashed) from
lookup_one_noperm() and on the next iteration being buggered on mutex_lock()?

... with all fun that creates.  As it is, you have those async changers
of backing data using VFS locking _under_ sysfs locks via lookup_one_noperm()
and yet it needs sysfs_mutex inside sysfs_lookup().  So you can't have
sysfs_get_dentry() under it.  So you don't have exclusion with arseloads
of sysfs tree changes in there.  Joy...
Frankly, with the current state of sysfs the last vestiges of arguments
used to push it into the tree back then are dead and buried.  I'm not
blaming you, BTW - the shitpile *did* grow past the point where its
memory footprint became far too large and something needed to be done.
Unfortunately, it happened too late for that something being "get rid
of the entire mess" and now we are saddled with it for good.
