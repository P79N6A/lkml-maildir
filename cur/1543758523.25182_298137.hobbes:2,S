Thanks for the hints.  Unfortunately the cards in question really are 
fairly generic and thus don't appear in the list.  I tried the first 75 
cards as insmod options (using a script of course), and some of them are 
different, but none work properly.
I am lucky in that I still have a spare.  If you could suggest a very 
well tested kernel for bttv (2.6.9?), I can set up another machine with 
that kernel and the remaining card.  That should allow me to isolate the 
problem better.  At the very least  I could get the right card= option 
to use for the broken pair.  Hopefully I will be able to generate a 
table entry for this card for bttv-cards.c;  I'll look some more at this 
tomorrow.
I've heard that there is some way to dump eeproms; Is there a way to 
write them also?  If I could copy the eeprom from the unused cards to 
the (now broken) pair that might fix things.
Thanks,
   Jim
