That was it, I guess.
virt_to_bus() is deprecated - driver *must* be converted
to the DMA mapping interface (see Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt).
virt_to_bus() on alpha works only for limited range of kernel addresses.
On dp264 valid range is 0x00000000-0x7fefffff (i.e. 2Gb - 1Mb).
Given the fact that __get_free_pages() returns highest possible
pages I'm not surprised that this driver doesn't work on a 2Gb machine.
Probably "mem=2047M" boot argument would help...
Ivan.
