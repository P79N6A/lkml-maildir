This has already been beaten to death and resolved. dma_mmap_coherent()
is the preferred solution and will have no reliance on the coremap apart
from requiring it when faults are handled (to feed the core API), and
requiring prefaulting when coremap elements are absent for the mapped
areas. More importantly, it allows sane fallback to read()/write() and
understands the results of dma_alloc_coherent(), which virt_to_page(),
whose current use on dma_alloc_coherent()'s results causes driver bugs,
does not.
