Put the names of your machines in /etc/hosts on your logmachine.

I agree that it is ugly that you can't disable reverse with syslog. There
are implementations of the syslogd (syslog-ng) that do allow this. If you
want to stick with the 'normal' syslog, either recompile with an option
not do do reverse lookups, put you hosts in /etc/hosts, of hack the
source.

Because if is fast. Second, you can assume that remote logging is NOT done
over the internet, anyone who does is an idiot. So the change that some
UDP packet get's lost is close to zero. I think the changes are higher
that the connection oriented solutions would get messages lost.

I agree with the bad configuration remark at top. WHY do you want named to
do the reverse ?? Putting things in /etc/hosts makes thing hell of a lot
faster. With a central loghost that makes sense to me.
