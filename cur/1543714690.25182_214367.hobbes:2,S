mem= isn't there to tell the kernel what ram it owns and what ram it
doesn't own.  It's there to tell the kernel what ram is in the system.
 Since you told the system it only has 500m, it assumes the rest of
the 3.5G of address space is available for things like memory mapped
i/o.  If you cat /proc/iomem, you'll probably see something has
reserved the memory range in question.
I added a hack to make the kernel assume the greater of the mem= and
what is passed to in from the BIOS via the e820 maps is where the
unused address space starts.  It seems to eliminate such problems.
