I would say hat the file and all of its directory gets invalidated and
deleted as soon as the last opener of the file's main stream or some of
its directory content disappears. How would that be?

Hmm.

Right. But to change some properties you usually need to be the owner of
that file anyway, or root.

Only assuming mtime/ctime/atime/rwx/uid/gid of file contents can
actually be independant of those from the main stream. I would say that
the rights (read and write) for non-pseudo sub-files should the same as
the file, uid and gid 644 (only owner can change these), something like
that. mtime, atime and ctime always show the same as the file itself.
Hmm.

That's what I was thinking.
