NO.
The above is
 (a) not portable
 (b) not current practice
The "not portable" part comes from the fact that (as somebody pointed
out), a threaded environment in which the kernel _does_ close the FD on
errors, the FD may have been validly re-used (by the kernel) for some
other thread, and closing the FD a second time is a BUG.
The "not practice" comes from the fact that applications do not do what
you suggest.
The fact is, what Linux does and has always done is the only reasonable
thing to do: the close _will_ tear down the FD, and the error value is
nothing but a warning to the application that there may still be IO
pending (or there may have been failed IO) on the file that the (now
closed) descriptor pointed to.
The application may want to take evasive action (ie try to write the
file again, make a backup, or just warn the user), but the file
descriptor is _gone_.

But your loop is _provably_ incorrect for a threaded application.  Your
explicit system call locking approach doesn't work either, because I'm
pretty certain that POSIX already states that open/close are thread
safe, so you can't just invalidate that _other_ standard.
