The problem is that a 64-bit jiffies on a 32-bit machine would
require a spin-lock every time the jiffies variable is changed!
This is because there are two (or more) memory accesses for
every 64 bit operation, plus two or more register accesses for
every 64 bit operation. If a context-switch or an interrupt
occurs between those operations, all bets are off about the
result.
The appended small tar.gz file contains some 64-bit assembly
plus some 64-bit C, Look at the assembly and it will become
obvious to you that you don't want to use a 64-bit timer
on a 32 bit machine.
