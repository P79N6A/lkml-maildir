That's a fairly good point - the fact that even if you came up with the
perfect hierarchy that explained where everything is sanely, it would suck
simply because people don't think that way.
In the end, we just have to balance the "everything in one place so that
it is easy to find" with "uhhuh, that 'ls' output is just too confusing,
and I can't seem to find my driver any more".
