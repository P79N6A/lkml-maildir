You don't really answer the core question, why do you change everything to 
nanoseconds and 64bit values?

With -mm you can now choose the HZ value, so that's not really the 
problem anymore. A lot of archs even never changed to a higher HZ value. 
So now I still like to know how does the complexity change compared to the 
old code?

Well, AFAICT on slower machines (older and embedded stuff) it's a serious 
issue. The current code calculates the timeval with some simple 32bit 
calculations. Your code introduces the nsec step, which means several 
64bit calculations and suddenly the overhead explodes on some machines.
As m68k maintainer I see no reason to ever switch to your new code, which 
might leave you with the dilemma having to maintain two versions of the 
timer code. What reason could I have to switch to the new timer code?
I had no problems with a little more overhead, like a _few_ more 64bit 
operations per second (and preferably add/shifts), but I'm not really 
enthusiastic about the new code. Why don't you keep the main part 32 bits 
(or long)? What's wrong with using timeval or timespec?
I like the concept of the a time source in your patch. m68k already uses a 
number of timer related callbacks into machine specific code. If I could 
replace that with a timer driver, I'd be really happy. OTOH if it requires 
several expensive conversion between different time formats, I rather keep 
the current code.
bye, Roman
