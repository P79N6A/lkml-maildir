Generally speaking if you have an AMD Athlon based board that will run with
a Pentium II/III kernel but not and Athlon optimised kernel you have a
hardware flaw, or misprogrammed chipset.
Some BIOSes misconfigure the VIA chipsets at least, and that causes this 
problem when we run the memory bus flat out with the athlon optimised 
prefetching memory copies
