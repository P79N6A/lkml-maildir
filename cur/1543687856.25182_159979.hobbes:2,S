Yeah, it probably penalises parents and children too much on fork, and
doesn't penalise parents of exiting cpu hogs enough. I have noticed
this too.

renicing IMO is a lot more sane in my patches, although others might
disagree. In Con's patches, when you make X -20, it gets huge timeslices.
In my version, it will get lots of smaller timeslices.
Thanks again for testing.
