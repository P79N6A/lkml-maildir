Well, I'm trying explicitly to not change the kernel's current NTP
behavior. Instead I'm trying to allow the current NTP behavior to apply
to a continuous clocksource to avoid interpolation error and other
problems with irregular timer interrupts.
Although Its an interesting point, and I'm not opposed to discussing it,
its just not really relevant to the patch. So you might want to start a
new thread.
Also, I think the debate has been brought up a number of times on
comp.protocols.time.ntp, so you might want to check there first.
thanks
