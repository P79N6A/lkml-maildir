I used a few dozen NetGear FA310TX's, many in various Tyan Tomcat I, II, and
IV boards.  The only times I had problems were when I got bad NIC cards
(after they switched from 21140 to LiteOn chips, quality control appeard to
go out the window), or when I got my first LiteOn versions and the driver in
the kernel didn't support them.

I don't know what they're shipping with the cards now, but in the past they
used to ship a badly hacked driver.  You're _much_ safer sticking with
either what's included with the kernel or the latest release from
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html
