Of course it can.  Look, netlink is used on routers to transfer
hundreds of thousands of routing table entries in one fell swoop
between a user process and the kernel every time the next hop Cisco
has a BGP routing flap.
If you must have "enterprise wide client server" performance, we can
add mmap() support to netlink sockets just like AF_PACKET sockets support
such a thing.  But I _really_ doubt you need this and unlike netlink sockets
relayfs has no queueing model, whereas not only does netlink have one it's
been tested in real life.
You guys are really out of your mind if you don't just take the netlink
printk thing I did months ago and just run with it.  When someone first
told showed me this relayfs thing, I nearly passed out in disbelief that
people are still even considering non-netlink solutions.
