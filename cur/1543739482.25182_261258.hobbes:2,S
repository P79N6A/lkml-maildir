Seems you are not part of one of these organisations.
That argument will not suffice.
Try to estimate the cost associated with the shift:
- Training
- Less efficiency in a period
- Missing important tools so a terminal service is needed
- etc.
The valid solution here would be to deploy a Linux server.
But then your arguments suffer compared to other OS'es where
everything is running on the users current host - why have
the hassle with a Linux server.
