Imagine you have a shared library of code that makes writing some kind of
driver easier, and you don't see why it should be available to non GPL
driver modules. 
Linus has made it absolutely (as in he'll send out the killer penguin with
chainsaw if need be) clear that existing symbols wont mysteriously turn GPL 
only.
