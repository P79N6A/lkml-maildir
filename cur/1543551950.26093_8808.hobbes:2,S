Axel, are these changes to the kernel configuration options okay with
you?
Kernel Developers, please try this one out.  I don't have any non-i386
architecture machines to try this out on.
Various changes to unify and automate the frame buffer boot graphic and
to offer kernel configuration options for quelling printk()'s and
centering the graphic to make a nice, professional-looking first
impression on all those consumer-device users.  :-)
In summary:
    - New kernel configuration options:
        - CONFIG_QUIET_PRINTK: turns off boot messages
        - CONFIG_FBLOGO_{TOPLEFT,CENTER}: choose logo alignment
        (Documentation in Configure.help included, of course.)
    - New script (make_bootlogo.pl) to install any graphic as the boot
logo
    - Restructured header files for boot graphic:
        - Retained platform-specific defaults.
        - Simple one-spot override (see
Documentation/fb/make_bootlogo.txt)
    - fbcon.c and console.c modified to support new features.
        (I looked over the recent patches by Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz,
James Simmons, and Geert Uytterhoeven and I don't think there are any
collisions.)
Many thanks to Torrey Hoffman and Mohammad A. Haque for their input on
boot graphic positioning.
