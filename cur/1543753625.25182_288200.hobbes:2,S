<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/nmi.o
arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c: In function `check_nmi_watchdog':
arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:130: error: `cpu_callin_map' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:130: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:130: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [arch/i386/kernel/nmi.o] Error 1
