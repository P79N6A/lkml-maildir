Ok, that's perhaps the point for me to step in. I supervised the thesis of 
Bernhard within our Embedded Linux group at Siemens CT SE 2.
Unfortunately, we currently don't plan doing further enhancements to this 
driver like porting it to other hardware. It was more or less an unplanned 
result of a thesis to show ways how to port drivers to a realtime extension - 
and as it was indeed a very good and usable result (thanks to Bernhard 
again!), we decided to open source it in the hope it might be useful.
However, if a real user community forms around the project, we might rethink 
this decision. However I can't promise anything...

No, definitely not. You can make basic usage of the package without 
NetServices (we provide small examples which don't need NetServices), but for 
real-world product usage you might still need to buy a NetServices license 
from SMSC.
