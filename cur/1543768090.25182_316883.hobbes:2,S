Thanks for feedback.

These runs don't look absolutely "ideal" as one nice 19 task is bound to cpu1 
however since you're running hyperthreading it would seem the SMT nice code 
is keeping that under check anyway (0:23 vs 6:11)

These runs pretty much confirm what I found to happen. My test machine for 
this was also 4x. I can't see how the code would behave differently on 2x. 
Perhaps if I make the prio_bias multiplied instead of added to the cpu load 
it will be less affected by SCHED_LOAD_SCALE. The attached patch was 
confirmed during testing to also provide smp distribution according to nice 
on 4x. Carlos I know your machine is in production so you testing may not be 
easy for you. Please try this on top if you have time.
Cheers,
Con

This patch alters the effect priority bias has on busy rebalancing by 
multiplying the cpu load by the total priority instead of adding it.
