Yep. This is the exactly the issue other product groups normally raise
on Linux. How do we measure memory pressure in linux ? Some of our
software products want to grow or shrink their memory usage depending
on the memory pressure in the system. Since most memory is used for
cache, "free" really doesn't indicate anything -they are monitoring
info in /proc/meminfo and swapping rates to "guess" on the memory
pressure. They want a clear way of finding out "how badly" system
is under memory pressure. (As a starting point, they want to find out
out of "cached" memory - how much is really easily "reclaimable" 
under memory pressure - without swapping). I know this is kind of 
crazy, but interesting to think about :)
