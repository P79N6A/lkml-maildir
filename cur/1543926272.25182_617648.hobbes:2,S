Subject: rt-preempt: problem compiling rt-preempt 2.6.23.1-rt11 on MIPS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I applied the patches in patch-2.6.23.1-rt11-broken-out.tar.bz2
to a Linux kernel version 2.6.23.1 (along with a few other
board specific patches).
I got the following compilation error:
  GEN     /home/tbird/work/rt-preempt/build/tx49/Makefile
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  CALL    /home/tbird/work/rt-preempt/linux-2.6.23.1-rt11/scripts/checksyscalls.sh
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      kernel/latency_trace.o
/home/tbird/work/rt-preempt/linux-2.6.23.1-rt11/kernel/latency_trace.c:28:21: error: asm/rtc.h: No such file or directory
make[2]: *** [kernel/latency_trace.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [kernel] Error 2
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 2
Indeed, there is no include/asm-mips/rtc.h.
I commented out the include line in latency_trace.c, and everything
compiled fine.  I'm not sure what is needed in an arch-specific rtc.h,
but compiling without it for the mips arch caused no problems.
Should I create a patch with a stub for rtc.h for mips?
As an aside, this has me worried.  Is anyone else doing any
RT Preempt testing or work on MIPS platforms, or am I forging
new ground? :-)
