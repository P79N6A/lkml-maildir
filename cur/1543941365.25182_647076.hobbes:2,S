You're probably thinking of CONFIG_MODULES, which indicates the kernel
supports module loading.  MODULE indicates the current code is being
compiled as a module.  The idea is that code compiled in the kernel can't
call modules.  Generally what you would see is:
#if CONFIG_ON(x)
code that will be _used by_ x
probably want x to depend on us in Kconfig
#endif
#if CONFIG_AVAILABLE(x)
code that wants _to use_ x
#endif
