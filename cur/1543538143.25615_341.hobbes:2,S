     I am going to look at libsafe; I had previously heard that it was for
x86 platforms only and I'm really looking for a portable solution so I can
use on both x86, sgi, sparc-32, and sparc-64 platforms I have here.  But I
see source is available so I'll take a look.
     I don't disagree that the non-executable user stack area can be gotten
around, so can Stackguard, and I haven't looked at libsafe yet but I don't feel
comfortable counting on anything as a complete solution.  The more layers the
better.
