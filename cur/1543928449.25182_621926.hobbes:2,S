That undock button generate an ACPI event, right?  You probably need
to hook that ACPI event such that something like the following gets
executed.
echo 1 > /sys/device/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.1/host?/target?:?:?:?/?:?:?:?/delete"

USB is capable of detecting hotplug event by itself.  Unfortunately,
ata_piix can't and in your case accessing non existent device is
resulting machine reset.  I don't know why tho.  It usually just
causes a bunch of timeouts before libata EH gives up on the device.

That's your BIOS trying to set UDMA UDMA5 on the drive and the drive
not liking it for some reason.

After two tries, libata thinks BIOS is no good and decides to turn off
ACPI.

Which results in successful configuration, yay.

Can you please post...
* full boot log with the ultra bay occupied.
* the result of "hdparm -I /dev/sr0" with the ultra bay occupied.
* the result of "lspci -nnvvv" with the ultra bay occupied.
* full boot log without docking station.
* the result of "lspci -nnvvv" without docking station.
Thanks.
