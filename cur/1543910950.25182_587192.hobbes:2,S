Good clustering would definitely help some delayed atime writeback
scheme.

I think we should assume a full scan of s_dirty is impossible in the
presence of concurrent writers.  We want to be able to pick a start
time (right now) and find all the inodes older than that start time.
New things will come in while we're scanning.  But perhaps that's what
you're saying...
At any rate, we've got two types of lists now.  One keeps track of age
and the other two keep track of what is currently being written.  I
would try two things:
1) s_dirty stays a list for FIFO.  s_io becomes a radix tree that
indexes by inode number (or some arbitrary field the FS can set in the
inode).  Radix tree tags are used to indicate which things in s_io are
already in progress or are pending (hand waving because I'm not sure
exactly).
inodes are pulled off s_dirty and the corresponding slot in s_io is
tagged to indicate IO has started.  Any nearby inodes in s_io are also
sent down.
2) s_dirty and s_io both become radix trees.  s_dirty is indexed by a
sequence number that corresponds to age.  It is treated as a big
circular indexed list that can wrap around over time.  Radix tree tags
are used both on s_dirty and s_io to flag which inodes are in progress.

In general, it is a better assumption than sorting by time.  It may
make sense to one day let the FS provide a clustering hint
(corresponding to the first block in the file?), but for starters it
makes sense to just go with the inode number.

The elevator can only sort the pending IO, and we send down a
relatively small window of all the dirty pages at a time.  If we sent
down all the dirty pages and let the elevator sort it out, we wouldn't
need this clustering at all.
But, that has other issues ;)
