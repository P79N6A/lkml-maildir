  The change prevents use of stale data, and is a good one. mtools was a
hack from the days when some operating systems didn't speak DOS file
format, and reliability is more important than performance.
  That said, can't you just keep the drive accessed and avoid the
problem?
  sleep 3600 </dev/fd0 &
should do it. Just kill the process when you eject the floppy, or you
will get back the stale data problem.
  I don't believe the detection of a new floppy in the drive is reliable
on all systems or they would have flushed on loading a new diskette. I
seem to remember that not all drives provide the signal, at least back
when I wrote my last floppy driver (DEC Rainbow, about 20 years ago).

  His first management concern is not solving the problem, but covering
his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
