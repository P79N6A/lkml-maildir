Right. Adding to it. To begin with the system namespace has all its
entire tree shared. So when a new namespace is cloned, the new namespace
can see any new mount/unmount/binds done in the system namespace as
well. (System namespace is the first initial namespace created by
default).
Any private mounts done by the user in his private-namespace 
will first make that part of the tree private first and then will
continue with the mount. Otherwise the private mount will end up showing
in the system namespace(since it is shared).
