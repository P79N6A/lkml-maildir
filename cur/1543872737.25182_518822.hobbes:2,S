either way works for me, i was just identifying unused header files.
rday
p.s.  just to clarify, when i use the adjective "unused", i mean that
that header file is not used *anywhere* in the source tree -- not even
in an include that is currently commented out or conditionally
included.  i mean *nowhere* (as long as i didn't screw up my
programming, that is).
so whether people want to keep those header files in the tree is up to
them.
