I wonder why it's never oopsed.  Perhaps there's always a zero in there for
some reason.

I spent quite some time comparing with ext3.  I'm a bit stumped and I'm
suspecting that the simplistic porting the code is now OK, but something's
just wrong.
I assume that the while (1) loop in ext3_try_to_allocate_with_rsv() has
gone infinite.  I don't see why, but more staring is needed.
What lock protects the fields in struct ext[234]_reserve_window from being
concurrently modified by two CPUs?  None, it seems.  Ditto
ext[234]_reserve_window_node.  i_mutex will cover it for write(), but not
for pageout over a file hole.  If we end up with a zero- or negative-sized
window then odd things might happen.

I suspect that was not a good idea - it has added rather different
behaviour in the once-in-a-million case.
