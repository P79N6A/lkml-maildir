The two other commercially successful OSes - Windows and Solaris have  
12Kb and 8Kb default kernel stack sizes. And both seem to do well  
(hold on :) with the large stack sizes - meaning there is no  
commercially observed problem created by the 8K stack size. Solaris  
even lets you change the kernel stack size at runtime.
Even if we keep aside the impending argument about both OS'es being  
crap and we shouldn't be imitating them, we could still derive one  
conclusion from them - it is possible to have larger stack on i386  
without problems (albeit with some drawbacks) which could be used  
under certain circumstances.
