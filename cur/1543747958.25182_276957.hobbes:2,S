Subject: Net Filter Driver --- How to send the information to application after packet arrives

Dear All,
I am new to net work drivers. 
I have developed a very simple/small net filter driver to capture the
network packets from my network path. It was working fine. Whenever a
packet goes through my network path it was simply prints a message. It
was printing the messages fine.
Now I want to send the buffer address which is allocated in the "hook"
function in the driver code to the application. Is there any way to send
it to the application? (As I know ioctl and mmap, but these two are
initiated from the application. Actually I want send the signal from
"hook" function to the application whenever a packet arrives. Is there
any method which was already exists? OR Can I implement it as CHARACTER
driver to work with mmap?)
Please go though the code attached below.
