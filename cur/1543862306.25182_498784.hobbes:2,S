Umm.. it's definitely workable, and even almost trivial.
Just splitting kobject_uevent() routine into two parts, one to format
the environment variables, and one to actually send things over netlink
and executing the hotplug_helper if defined, and using the first part
to format the content of `uevent' file will do the trick.
I don't know how to do the last part.

It has less and less chances to work correctly.  For example, this dynamic
sdX thing, when I don't know anymore which sdX is which, without some help
from /dev/disk/by-XXX/.
And more and more software requires udev, at least as packages by distos.
For example, today I've got rid of udev on one of our servers, which has
been installed (debian) due to xen-utils having Depends: udev.  Even when
it doesn't *really* *require* udev, -- i replaced the whole thing with a
5-line shell script.
