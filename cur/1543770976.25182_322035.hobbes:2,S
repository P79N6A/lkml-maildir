Bernd,
 	The ENBD project requires a kernel patch for 2.6 support and I 
would like to remain with the vendor supplied (and "blessed" kernel) for 
support reasons.
 	Since I cannot provide feedback on the latest version of the 
kernel and I don't want to have an "unblessed" kernel, I've opened a 
ticket with RedHat attached to my support contract for this problem.  I 
mainly posted my question here to see if this was a known issue with 2.6 
in general or NBD-specific.
 	I had not heard of "DRBD" before now, but it looks interesting.  I 
am looking into it further.
Thanks,
 	Roy Keene
