Subject: [BUG] netpoll is unable to handle skb's using packet split

When using packet split, netpoll times out when doing a netdump.
Server logs:
--netdump[14973]: Got too many timeouts in handshaking, ignoring
client 172.0.2.250
--netdump[14973]: Got too many timeouts waiting for SHOW_STATUS for
client 172.0.2.250, rebooting it.
When packet split is not used, netpoll dumps correctly.  This was
reproduced using the initial setup:
HP DL380G3 (Server)
RHEL4 U1
7170 NIC
e1000 driver
HP DL380G4 (Client)
RHEL3 U5
7170 NIC
e1000 driver
We also tested using the latest RHEL4 U2 on the client, with the same results.
Netpoll does not appear to be able to handle skb's using packet split,
a possible resolution would be to test for packet split and to use
skb_linearize() in netpoll to resolve the issue.
