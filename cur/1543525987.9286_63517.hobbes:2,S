Well, that gets me closer to a working system. My network card doesn't
install proerly, though:
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [apm]
Adding cardbus controller 0: PCI device 104c:ac15
PCI: Enabling device 00:04.0 (0000 -> 0002)
Yenta IRQ list 0000, PCI irq0
Socket status: 30000059
Adding cardbus controller 1: PCI device 104c:ac15
PCI: Enabling device 00:04.1 (0000 -> 0002)
