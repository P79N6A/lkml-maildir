There seems to be some breakage here:
	drivers/mmc/core/host.c: In function ‘mmc_remove_host’:
	drivers/mmc/core/host.c:146: error: implicit declaration of function ‘led_trigger_unregister’
	drivers/mmc/core/host.c:146: error: ‘struct mmc_host’ has no member named ‘led’
this was after doing a few "make randconfig" runs, a habit I'm trying to 
encourage (and do myself occasionally too).
