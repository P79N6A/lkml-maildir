I suspect the reason for the big difference is runqueue lock contention
(as in the original chat benchmark).
It might be interesting to keep the benchmark load the same and
rerun with a varying number of CPUs.  My 'guess' is that with the
default scheduler you will see better numbers with less CPUs.  When
we were working with chat on an 8-way Intel, we saw benchmark
numbers peak at around 4 CPUs.  As you added more than 4 CPUs,
your benchmark numbers got worse.  You can see this graphicly at:
