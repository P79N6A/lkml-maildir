Perhaps there might be some feedback from the embedded folks and/or 
those who decide if these changes are what they want to go in the 
kernel. If you're going to do something like this, one of the embedded 
vendors might want to contribute to development. Clearly smaller 
software parts have advantages, if resources were available to do it 
split as part of the modification.
That would probably reduce the maintenence effort in the future as well.
