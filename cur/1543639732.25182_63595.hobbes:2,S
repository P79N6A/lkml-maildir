Agreed, the current form is a direct result of the current dep_tristate
semantics and would not be necessary with your proposed semantics.

Bizarre.

Along these lines, CML2 had a menu 'buses' very early in the root of
the tree, containing queries for ISA, PCI, MCA, SERIAL, PARPORT,
HOTPLUG, IDE, SCSI, USB, IEEE1394 and FC4.  I won't post the code
here because I can't fully understand it anymore :-(

You will also probably want to deal with the cases where possibly null-valued
symbols are compared against "n" like this
if [ "$CONFIG_NOT_DECLARED" != "n" ]; then....

Shouldn't be too hard, I'm already doing something like this to distinguish
between forward declared and undeclared symbols for the forward-reference
and undeclared-symbol warnings.
