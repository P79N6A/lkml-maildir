Thanks for the patch...
BTW.. if you want this maximally useful, it would be nice to have
userspace interface for this. swsusp is done from userspace these days
(-mm kernel), and I guess it would be useful for "we have just
finished big&ugly memory trashing job, can we get our interactivity
back"? Like I'd probably cron-scheduled it just after updatedb, and
added it to scripts after particular lingvistic experiments...
