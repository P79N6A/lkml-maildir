As I've thought about this in the past, I realized that /proc 
is serving two purposes.  It is exporting the list of processes,
and it is also used to export kernel and driver information.
What we really need is for procfs to be just process stuff, and the
creation of a separate kernelfs nodev filesystem though which
the kernel can share all the gory details about the hardware,
drivers, phase of the moon, etc.   Since these serve two
fundamentally different tasks, doesn't it make sense to split
them into two separate filesystems?
