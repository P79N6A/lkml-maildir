I believe BAD_ADDR macro was changes from ((unsigned long)(x) >= TASK_SIZE)
(which is the right test for invalid user addresses, stronger check than
>= PAGE_MASK) to >= PAGE_MASK only because of the one check of the return
value of load_elf_interp.  All other uses of BAD_ADDR macro are either on
userland addresses (what do_mmap, elf_map, do_brk etc. return;
where TASK_SIZE or more is certainly wrong) or in one case still on unbiased
ELF p_vaddr:
if (BAD_ADDR(k) || elf_ppnt->p_filesz > elf_ppnt->p_memsz ||
in load_elf_binary (where >= TASK_SIZE check is ok too).
So perhaps doing this instead of changing BAD_ADDR to IS_ERR_VAL
might be better:
