I have a path for initramfs to use tmpfs.  It's sorta hacky so I never
submitted it and solves a niche problem for embedded people.
Ultimately we might one day still want to change how we initialize the
early userspace (Al suggesting a reasomably nice way to move the
decompressor(s) to userspace for example) so I don't feel there is a
compelling reason to do more than cleanups in this area right now.
