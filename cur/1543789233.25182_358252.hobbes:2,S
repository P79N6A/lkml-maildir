Ah, that clears up my misunderstanding.
Yes I agree the write side is OK.
Thanks Ben and Herbert. I guess I should do a proper patch then.

In mm/vmscan.c, the page reclaim may have the following sequence 2
running concurrently with sequence 1 on another CPU:
1                                2
find_get_page();
write to page                    write_lock(tree_lock);
SetPageDirty();                  if (page_count != 2
put_page();                              || PageDirty())
                                     /* page dirty or busy */
				 else
				     /* free it */
The comment indicates that PageDirty must be checked *after* page_count
indicates there are no users of this page, which prevents the dirty bit
from being lost in the case that that sequence 2 might see the state of
PageDirty() *before* SetPageDirty() in 1, but page_count *after* put_page
in 1.
However, there is no read memory barrier there, and so nothing to stop a
CPU from loading page_count before PageDirty (ie. ->flags). Theoretically,
data corruption is possible.
