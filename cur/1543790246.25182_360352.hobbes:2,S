Subject: [PATCH 01/02] Export Connector Symbol
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/25/215

        The Process Events Connector uses this symbol to determine if it
should respond to commands from userspace. However the it fails to link
without the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() macro.
