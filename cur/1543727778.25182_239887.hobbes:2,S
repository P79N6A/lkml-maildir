In our paper (I'm testing the patch now) we'll be proposing using the Fortuna
PRNG inplace of the current design.  It only uses SHA256 and AES256 (or any
message digest & block cipher combo).  The primary advantages of this design
would be:
 - It's simpler
 - It's faster
 - It doesn't "rool your own" crypto

If you pass all input data into a Yarrow-type PRNG - like the Fortuna PRNG
we're going to propose - you will never care about this since the current
state of the pools are always based on all the previous input.

I guess the point I was trying to make was:
 - You never want to wipe out the pool
 - You never want to let people (not even yourself) get access to the pool
   The closest thing you can do (and the paper will explain this) is hash
   a counter and the data from each of your pools though a message digest
   and concatenate it together.
I'm really putting the horse infront of the cart here.  We'll put a paper up
for lkml to read by the end of the month which will fully explain:
 - Our reasoning
 - Our goals
 - Our results
Cheers,
JLC
