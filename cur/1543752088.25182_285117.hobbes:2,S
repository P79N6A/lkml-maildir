We really should make "struct resource" use u64's. It's wrong even on x86, 
but we've never seen any real problems in practice, so we've had little 
reason to bother.
This has definitely come up before, maybe there's even some old patch 
floating around. It should be as easy as just fixing up "start/end" to be 
"u64" (and perhaps move them to the beginning of the struct to make sure 
packing is ok on all architectures), and fixing any fall-out.
