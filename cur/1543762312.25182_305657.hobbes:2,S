The only per-task data you need to maintain is a single pointer to
the per-CPU counter that was incremented by the outermost rcu_read_lock().
You also need a global index, call it "rcu_current_ctr_set" (or come
up with a better name!) along with a per-CPU pair of counters:
	struct rcu_ctr_set {	 /* or maybe there is a way to drop array */
		atomic_t ctr[2]; /* into DECLARE_PER_CPU() without a struct */
	}			 /* wrapper... */
	int	rcu_curset = 0;
	DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct rcu_ctr_set, rcu_ctr_set) = { 0, 0 };
You need two fields in the task structure:
	atomic_t *rcu_preempt_ctr;
	int rcu_nesting;
Then you have something like:
	void rcu_read_lock(void)
	{
		if (current->rcu_nesting++ == 0) {
			preempt_disable();
			current->rcu_preempt_ctr =
				&__get_cpu_var(rcu_ctr_set).ctr[rcu_curset];
			atomic_inc(current->rcu_preempt_ctr);
			preempt_enable();
			smp_mb();
		}
	}
	void rcu_read_unlock(void)
	{
		if (--current->rcu_nesting == 0) {
			smb_mb();  /* might only need smp_wmb()... */
			atomic_dec(current->rcu_preempt_ctr);
			current->rcu_preempt_ctr = NULL;  /* for debug */
		}
	}
One can then force a grace period via something like the following,
but only if you know that all of the rcu_ctr_set.ctr[!current] are zero:
	void _synchronize_kernel(void)
	{
		int cpu;
		spin_lock(&rcu_mutex);
		rcu_curset = !rcu_curset;
		for (;;) {
			for_each_cpu(cpu) {
				if (atomic_read(&__get_cpu_var(rcu_ctr_set).ctr[!rcu_curset]) != 0) {
					/* yield CPU for a bit */
					continue;
				}
			}
		}
		spin_unlock(&rcu_mutex);
	}
In real life, you need a way to multiplex multiple calls to
_synchronize_kernel() into a single counter-flip event, by
setting up callbacks.  And so on...
The above stolen liberally from your patch and from my memories of
Dipankar's RCU patch for CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels.  Guaranteed to have
horrible bugs.  ;-)
