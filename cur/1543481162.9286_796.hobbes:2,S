There's no reason why timeslices should have anything to do with swapin
IO time; we do not count time spent waiting for IO against the process's
allocated timeslice.

Page aging dramatically increases the amount of CPU time we spend
looking for free pages.  The selection of which pages to swap out really
shouldn't have anything to do with scheduling of CPU-bound processes
(which is the only time where timeslices actually count for anything).
