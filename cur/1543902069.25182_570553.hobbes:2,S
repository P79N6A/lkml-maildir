It is a bit tricky because of the way kernel/spinlock.c uses
the the inline asm (that, and unlocks are inlined), and some
of the debugging code.
Also, I'm not exactly sure what is the best way to clean up
spinlocks, if it is even possible. I'm afraid to touch it
more than I have to :)

OK, I like that better too. I didn't even realise I changed this
because it is mechanical to do the __. That's good to know and I'll
change my habit now.
