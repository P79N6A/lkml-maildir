Well boys, I know about the ifconfig command, and I just don't see 
anything special there.
In esp. no collision indications. I would rather suspect, that there are 
maybe some IRQ sharing
problems with the driver, since this got changed as well. However I 
simple just didn't
have the time to narrow it down to this. (In esp. doing a recompile with 
just the blah_irq -> blash_irqsave
changes enabled.
