Hi,
I am wondering if anyone is currently working on a fix for AGP 3.0 on 
the VIA KT400, KT400-A chipsets, and is looking for someone to test patches.
I am using a Gigabyte GA-7VAX-A board with the KT400-A chipset, and a 
Matrox Marvel eTV Video card (G450). This is a 4X card, but it appears 
to me that VIA removed AGP 2.0 support from the KT400-A.
As far as I can tell, although my videocard is 4X, according to 
Giga-byte, the KT400-A supports only 4X and 8X cards using AGP 3.0 mode 
only.
I have tried the backport from the 2.5 tree that was posted a while ago, 
and while it appeared to work, X crashed hard every time I ran a 3D app.
Thanks in advance,
