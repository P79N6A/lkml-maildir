Subject: [PATCH 01/13] bring driver version number to 47
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/20/524

These patches were made against kernel 2.6.24-rc5-mm1 kernel.  They
were submitted earlier and have been modified to incorporate feedback
from the kernel development community.  I am resending them after
resolving conflicts with patches already in the mm tree.
The eleventh patch in the old series was obsoleted by a patch in the
2.6.24-rc5-mm1 tree, gregkh-driver-block-device.patch, and has been
omitted.  The last patch in this series is new but straightforward.
