get_mem_map appears in place where pre7 used to do:
	for (i = MAP_NR(table); i < MAP_NR(table_end); i++) {
and now
	for (page = virt_to_page(table); page < get_mem_map(table_end); page++)
so I wouldn't call it reverting stuff (unless Linus has some special intent
with get_mem_map like making it a const inline so that it is never evaluated
more than once).
On the other side, if mem_map_*reserve are the preferred API, it should be
IMHO moved out of wrapper.h because the name of the header suggest it is
something non-standard.
