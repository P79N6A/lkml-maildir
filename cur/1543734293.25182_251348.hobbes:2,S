We already have a mechanism for this: suspend/resume. The downside to
this approach is that after I get a resume I have to rebuild the
hardware state. It takes a while to rebuild half a gig of graphics
state but this model will provide the required isolation.

suspend/resume will address this too. On VT switch DRM would receive a
suspend command and fbdev a resume, then vice versa on the way back.
We will have to build a scheme for assigning a driver to each VT. A
general mechanism would extend this beyond the video drivers.
This is implementing device driver multitasking something I didn't
want to do. I never said it wouldn't work, I just didn't want to do
it. I thought the complexity/performance trade offs weren't worth it.

Why do we have fifteen video drivers for the radeon and only one for
each SCSI card? Could it be that the SCSI drivers are well designed
and do everything needed, thus removing the incentive for most people
to write new ones? If we had a good, standardized library for
accessing accelerated drawing functions people might stop rewriting
the video drivers. I'd rather spend my effort trying to build a good
library rather than building sandboxes to keep fifteen partial
libraries from interfering.

You almost said resume - "release event" was real close.

Build the sandboxes and then let everyone play.
