Hi... This may not be kernel related, but I can't find a list where it
fits...
Every since we started using NIS, we're getting a lot of errors on the
Linux workstations saying Cannot silly delete NFS ????? 
We're also getting messages in the logs saying 
Oct 20 17:44:38 theakston kernel: fh_verify:
root/wayne.office.moneyworld.co.uk permission failure, acc=13, error=13
These both started around the same time and I can't find any references to
them in my docs... 
Any help would be _much_ appreciated...
Thanks,
