I agree but I still questinon usefullness of that data.

OK, so the first example illustrates that input core does not provide
"tone" data - no surprise here. The scond example proves that pcspkr
driver does not handle concurrent access very well. Still the input
core behaved exactly as it was supposed to, everythng is fine as far
as I can see.
