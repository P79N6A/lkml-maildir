Ingo,
These two patches should go to 2.6.28. They are fixes to the ring buffer
for bugs that will make the ring buffer stop reading, and/or produce
a false positive.
If these are too late for 2.6.28, then we probably should get them at least
to the stable branch and queued for 2.6.28.1.
The following patches are in:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-2.6-trace.git
    branch: devel
Steven Rostedt (2):
      ring-buffer: fix dangling commit race
      ring-buffer: prevent false positive warning
