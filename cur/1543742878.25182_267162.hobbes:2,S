That's a nutty problem... but suppose 2.7 opened tomorrow, how would
you justify putting in a new scheduler even then? And how would you
get enough testing to ensure a repeat of early 2.6 didn't happen again?
I'd be very happy if we could figure out the answer to that question,
but I'm afraid pluggable schedulers probably isn't it (unfortunately).

Specialised users always have and always will do specialised
modifications, that's no problem. But as much as I hate to say it
(it's a good thing, I'd just like to be able to get nicksched in),
it seems that the current scheduler *is* actually good enough for
a general purpose operating system. At least the lack of complaints
seems to indicate that.
My proposal to the "how to get a new scheduler in" question is a set
of pretty comprehensive controlled (blind of course), subjective tests
with proper statistical analysis, to determine best behaviour... And
I'm only half joking :(

But so long as you don't have a compelling argument to _replace_
the current scheduler, people who want to use other ones may as
well just patch them in. By having multiple schedulers however,
you don't IMO get too many benefits and a lot of downsides that
Ingo pointed out.
That said, if you were able to get a unanimous "yes" from Linus,
Andrew, and Ingo then I wouldn't complain too loudly...
