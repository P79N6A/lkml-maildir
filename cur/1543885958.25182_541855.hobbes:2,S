RCU's incursion into SLAB that broke SLOB is relatively new. And it
only broke for people using SMP or SPARSEMEM. Intersection with target
audience of SLOB: ~0.

Yes. It can in fact put 512 8-byte objects in a 4k page. More
importantly, it can put 2 1k objects and 16 128-byte objects on the
same page instead of on two pages.

Perhaps. We'll need to look at some numbers.
