Brilliant, this violates section 2b from the GPLv2. If that's OK with
you, see a lawyer first.
A couple of months ago Larry McVoy gave this excellent advice:
  If you really want to know where you stand, it'll cost you around
  $15K and that, in my opinion, is fine. If it isn't worth $15K to
  protect your code then it is worth so little to you that there really
  is no good reason not to just GPL it from the start.
