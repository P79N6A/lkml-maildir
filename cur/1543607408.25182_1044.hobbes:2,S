Ok.  Another point of interest.
If I do ``head /dev/scd0'' as a user, it fails.
If I do ``head /dev/scd0'' as root, it works.
I had always thought that since I could autoload the sound stuff as a
normal user, that this would work as well.
Course, I also just noticed that rmmod -a doesn't unload modules either.
Grrrr.
