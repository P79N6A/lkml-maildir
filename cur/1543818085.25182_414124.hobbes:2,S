Indeed, I just have a bad feeling about hardwiring IP addresses this deep.
The problems with "my" idea would be, summarily, after a day:
Q: Is there are reason to use broadcast ARP semantics for other IP
address ranges?
A: Maybe, but no RFC defines that.
Q: Is there are reason to NOT use broadcast ARP semantics for the
defined IP address ranges?
A: Maybe, but the RFC is against it.
Q: Is there a reason to expect people (and tools) to use/define scopes?
A: Probably, but it's still uncommon practice :)  I mean, how many of
us have 192.168.x.x addresses with "global" scope? I know I do.
I'm still in a losing position :)
