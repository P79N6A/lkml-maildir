So the proposal is specifically:
if a directory has its chattr 's' "bit" set, then all newly created 
files within that directory inherit the chattr 's' "bit".
Personally, I think that extends beyond simply privacy protection, and 
addresses how chattr values are handled by the file system. Privacy 
protection wouldn't affect the way in which the chattr values are 
handled, so if they are inherited through directories then fine... but I 
don't see this as specific to secure deletion.
