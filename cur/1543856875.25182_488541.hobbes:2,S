I would personally be ok with "flush_scheduled_work()" _itself_ noticing 
that it is actually waiting to flush "itself", and just being a no-op in 
that case.
However, having outside code do that detection for it seems to be ugly as 
hell. And something like the network drievr layer shouldn't know about 
keventd details like this.
So if you can move that deadlock avoidance logic into 
"flush_scheduled_work()" itself, we'd avoid the stupid export, and we'd 
also avoid the driver layer having to care about these things. It would 
still be _ugly_, but I think it would be less so.
Hmm?
