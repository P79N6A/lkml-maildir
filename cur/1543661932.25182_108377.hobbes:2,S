Dear David,
Thanks for your response.
I sent it correctly after typing the full mail. I think this is 
some problem in rediff mails itself.
Anyway these are the my requirements:
1) My application is coming around 8 MB. So need a file system 
about 12 MB to which i should be able to mount the root of the 
Linux kernel.
2) I need read-only file system.
3) Is it possible to create multiple ram disks of multiple file 
systems like CRAMFS, RAMDISK for a single kernel?
Thanks in advance,
Nanda
