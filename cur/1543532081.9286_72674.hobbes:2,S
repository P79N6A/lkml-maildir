The deadlock mentioned is usually cleared by memory scheduling activity
among batch/interactive jobs. I have seen it under UNICOS, but I don't know
if it is available under IRIX.

If it is valid in a cluster it must also be valid in the node that controls
the cluster. On each node in the cluster it must be valid, although only
3 levels might be active at one time:
SYSHIGH and SYSLOW are always present - the user level might be different
at different times, but a node could be dedicated to that level, and
most likely that user for the duration of the job. This would lead to
more efficent execution on a per-node basis.
The control node must support all levels: I assume that this is also the
one to do the accounting, job start, load balancing...).
I would like to have a trusted system so that I can communicate with other
systems at a trusted level. I'm not holding my breath yet:)
I think the "full VMs with virtual network cards, CPUs, pure virtual memory,
block devices" is overkill. A full MLS kernel includes IPSec for network
security, and uses the ESP (extented security packet) information to
carry the security labels.

Why not? Most systems give interactive jobs a higher scheduling priority
than batch jobs, why shouldn't memory scheduling be done too. This is what
usually breaks memory deadlocks anyway.

Entirely acceptable by me.
