In 2.4 with slabinfo format version 1.1, I can sum up the total pages used
for all slab caches, but the number of pages used is not in the 1.0 format
(in the 2.2 kernel).
Is there a way to get the total amount of slab cache memory used in a 2.2
kernel from userspace?
Same question for a 2.0 kernel too. :)
Thanks,
Mike
