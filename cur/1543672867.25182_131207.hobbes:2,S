Did not work on multi-threaded programs at the time(at least strace
didn't), nowadays I'd use gdb as I explained in the original mail.
The point is that I used to get a convenient mechanism for working
around or fixing bugs in the kernel and applications without any
downtime. This is are very useful capability to have even if it is
only needed rarely.
Is there any reasonable way to be able to do modify a running kernel
like this? I assume I can't count on the method from Phrack working
forever...
