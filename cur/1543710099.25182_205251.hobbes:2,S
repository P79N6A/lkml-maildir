I believe that is all that CRC32C requires.  I had hesitated to add
the setkey/setseed method because I mentally had it tied to "init",
which is not necessary, as your patch shows.  I also didn't know what
to do with the "&flags" parameter, but I gather that passing it in and
not using it is fine.  Should "unsigned int keylen" be also "const" or
does that matter?
