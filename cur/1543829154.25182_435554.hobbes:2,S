Mine too.  I wonder if its related to the (apparently) bluetooth-caused 
oops I reported earlier today?
Though I'm seeing the suspend problem on a system with no bluetooth 
module loaded; the only USB device on the bus is the fingerprint-reader.
My suspend script removes the uhci_hcd module on suspend.  The device 
complaining EBUSY is the ehci hub, which has nothing hanging off it.
