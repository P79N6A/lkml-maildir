On a number of motherboards (mine included) the bottom two PCI slots share
an IRQ. If this is true you will need to physically move one of
the cards to another slot.
I had this problem with a sounblaster16 PCI and my adaptec scsi
card. I'd recommend leaving all the pnp stuff in the bios on
unless you're sure it's a problem. It's more convenient if you're
dual booting, as most do, after all what better hardware tester
is than windoze ;)
