I understand what you're saying, and if that's the case, then fine, I will
switch to raid five, but there are about 100 other reports on this list of
"access beyond end of device" problems completely unrelated to well
anything.  When I see this, it leads me to believe that the problem is
much deeper then a raid issue.
I will do what you suggest and report back to you.  Thanks for your help.
