  I suspect the problem is related to loading the aic7xxx.o module, but the
  relevant messages have scrolled off the top of the screen.  I tried setting the
  VGA mode to extended to give me 50 lines of output, but even though "lilo -q
  -v" shows "VGA mode: EXTENDED", I still have a 25 line screen.
Well, I noticed I hadn't configured CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT, which is why I wasn't
able to put my monitor into extended mode.  It now works, and I further noticed
I hadn't enabled RAM disk support, so my initial RAM disk wasn't being loaded.
So, 2.4.0 now boots (still with problems, probably caused by the modutils
changes, but at least I can debug now).
Thanks to the many people who emailed me with suggestions.
