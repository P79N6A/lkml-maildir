This doesn't regress - the problem really happens when we don't wait one

Still regresses (I tried noop instead of as)

Again all these end up waiting one at a time with mainline because it
forces buffered AIO to be synchronous, so we the regression doesn't
show up. But, when I apply my patches to make buffered fsAIO async,
so we aren't waiting one at a time -- there is a similar regression.
In fact it was this regression that made me go back and check if it
was happening with AIO-DIO as well.
