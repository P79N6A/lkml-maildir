You can have upto 6 argument on i386. Each argument needs an register 
to pass and the i386 has only 8 and two are used for the stack pointer
and the syscall number. This leaves you 6.
Other architectures may not have that limitation.

Yes. Just pass a pointer to an auxillary structure as the first argument
and do a copy_from_user on that structure at the entry point. Put the
arguments in that structure. In user space you can hide the structure in a 
stub.
Some system calls (mmap, old_select, socketcall) are in fact implemented 
like this because they were designed before the entry point supported
6 arguments.
A note on design: if you have a function call that needs 12 arguments you
probably forgot some[1] (in short it is a strong cue for a broken design,
you should probably split it in smaller calls)
