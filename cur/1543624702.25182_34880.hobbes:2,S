If we put every single requested obscure fix for one or two boxes into
the kernel configuration you'd be spending weeks wading through
"Handle weird APM on Dave's homebrew mediagx"
and other questions.
Let me suggest something else. For any kernel built with TSC assumed
(586TSC +) initialize the udelay loop to something guaranteed to be at
least too long for any conceivable processor and use udelay() for the I/O
delay timing.
