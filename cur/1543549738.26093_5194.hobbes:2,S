There are many cases where it is simple to do:
          if( alloc(r1) == fail) goto freeall
          if( alloc(r2) == fail) goto freeall
          if( alloc(r3) == fail) goto freeall
And the alloc functions don't know how to "freeall".
Perhaps it would be good to do an alloc_vec allocation in these cases.
      alloc_vec[0].size = n;
      ..
      alloc_vec[n].size = 0;
      if(kmalloc_all(alloc_vec) == FAIL) return -ENOMEM;
      else  alloc_vec[i].ptr is the pointer.
