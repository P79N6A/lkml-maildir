Please don't remove this! This was preparatory work I did to enable
me to use PCI buses on nodes > 0 on NUMA-Q. The rest of the code
isn't in 2.5 yet (hence you can't see where it's used ;-) ) but the patches
to use it are now in 2.4, and I will submit them to 2.5 very shortly ....
(guess I'd better hurry up ;-) )
Thanks,
Martin.
