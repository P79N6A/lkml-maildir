I tried to fix it. I believe I'll have it working within 30 minutes
with followup patch. Well, so it was less than 30 ;-).

The code is also suspend-specific, and suspend-to-disk will have very
similar function in very near future.
Here's followup patch that makes it work. Notice freeze_processes() --
if you don't do that you risk data corruption. Please apply,
