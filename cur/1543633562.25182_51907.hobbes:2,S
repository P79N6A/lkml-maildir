Actually I have monitored linux/include/linux/*.h for improper
and inadequate inlining. Well what have I to say. In comparision
to the last time I checked (around 4 years ago) the situation
got *much* better. I was not able to save more then around 1k of
code from the kernel... How ever some offenders are:
1. elv_next_request(request_queue_t *q)
-  just too big
2. seq_putc(struct seq_file *m, char c)
- just not worth the trobule.
3. seq_puts(struct seq_file *m, const char *s)
- calls strlen and memset - really not worth inlining.
4. void DQUOT_INIT(struct inode *inode)
  void DQUOT_DROP(struct inode *inode)
DQUOT_PREALLOC_SPACE_NODIRTY(struct in
int DQUOT_PREALLOC_SPACE(struct inode *inode, qsize_t nr)ode *inode, qsize_t
and friends from quotaops - all to be to be inlines.
But the situation got really really better over time!
Please note that I didn't look at include/asm/*.h files, where
memset copy_from/to_user strlen and friends reside, which
result in quite a lot of inline code.
