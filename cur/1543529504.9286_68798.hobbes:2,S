In other words, we should try to detect malloc() ABOUT to return NULL, and
use that as a cue to find and kill the process using the most VM, then
retry the malloc() call? Sounds like the best solution, IMHO.
So:
* Code to trap memory allocation failure (kernel)
* Code to find and kill most suitable process (user-mode?)
* Interface between the two (e.g. /dev/problem?)
I'd prefer to keep the killing code user-mode, so it is easier to debug,
test, change etc., and keep the interface as generic as possible - we
could extend it to include other problems later.
I can code the user-mode end, and some of the interface bit, but I think
the MM hook itself needs someone else...
