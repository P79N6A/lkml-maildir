I work with many other architectures, so it's important to me. That's
aside anyway, just consider there are several Linux architectures. When
we write code we should consider those other architectures .. Non-x86
Linux is used pretty frequently. Dare I say that x86 and x86_64
installations combined don't out weigh all the other architecture
installations, that's only a guess but I wouldn't be surprised if that's
true.
