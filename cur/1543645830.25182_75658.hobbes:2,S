Subject: Sigh, any ideas for a "dump_stack" name?

Ok,
Still not got 2.5.40 to build...
ARM has, since the year dot, used "dump_stack()" to display any threads
stack, and has the following prototype:
static void dump_stack(struct task_struct *tsk, unsigned long sp)
However, somewhere in the 2.5.34 -> 2.5.40 development, "dump_stack" got
used as a way to call "show_stack" with a value of zero on x86 (which is
another externally visible function.)
Firstly, "dump_stack" is misnamed.  It dumps stack and call trace
information.
Secondly, it creates a small problem - we're running out of names
to describe a function that displays _just_ stack contents without
any call trace information.
So, I propose to change the ARM version to the following, unless someone
else can come up with another name or a fix the poliferation of stack-
displaying functions that the generic kernel seems to require.
dump_random_numbers_from_thread_stack_yes_a_very_long_name_that_wont_clash_with_anything_else()
(Note: it may be a static function, but it is useful on to make it public
for occasional debugging.)
