I evaluated this board for linux server use. Stay away from it.
When you hook up and install the hpt raid, it corrupts disk files. This is 
100% reproducible.
The non hpt controller on board works ok.
I believe this is related to the via chipset problem with the PCI bus 
(doesn't allow bursts that are long enough for high bandwidth pci devices).
We went with i845 based Intel 845BG boards and p4/1.8GHz cpu. Cost 
difference is not much and performance was much better
If you like an athlon solution, Tyan's 2466N-4M AMD MPX based board works 
well too.
You can read about the via bug here...

I had this problem with KT133A and KT266A motherboards.
Email me if you want more info.
Thanks
Nick
