Wait a minute, you're talking about inode operations, but then talking
about poll() and ioctl(), which are clearly file operations. Can you
clarify what exactly it is you want to overload? Changing inode
operations seems like a really bad design decision..

Too much flexibility is not something people usually argue as a a point
against adoption, especially for something as lightweight as debugfs,
that's certainly a new one :-)
If you're talking about struct file_operations, then it would seem you
would be best off sticking with debugfs. If the improved file operations
are suitable for kernel/relay.c then they can be integrated there and
then you don't have to worry about overloading the normal
relay_file_operations through some helper functions to hand off to
debugfs..
If you add native debugfs helper functions for creating relay files and
working in line with CONFIG_RELAY, then I'm sure these can be rolled back
in to debugfs proper, which should ease some of the LTTng maintenance.
I don't really see what having your own mount point and stubbed file
system would buy you over this..
