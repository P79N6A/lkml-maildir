Jepp, I have to agree. 
English is used more or less as an communication protocol in
computer science and for operating computers.
Once you know how to operate an computer in English, you can
operate nearly every computer in the world, because they have
English as default locale.
Let's not repeat Babel please :-(
PS: English is neither mine, nor Linus native language. Why do
   the English natives complain instead of us? ;-)
<off topic side note>
   And be glad that's not German, that has this role. English
   sentences are WAY easier to parse by computers, because it
   doesn't use much suffixes and prefixes on words and has very
   few exceptions. Also these exceptions are eleminated from
   command languages WITHOUT influencing readability and
   comprehensability.
