Yes, locking shouldn't be needed at those points; however, the warning
still fires because blk_queue_stack_limits() is using
queue_flag_clear() instead of queue_flag_unlocked().  Taking a look at
converting it to queue_flag_clear_unlocked() uncovered a couple more
overlooked sites (multipath.c:multipath_add_disk and
raid1.c:raid1_add_disk) where ->run has already been called...
The options I am thinking of all seem ugly:
1/ keep the unnecessary locking in MD
2/ make blk_queue_stack_limits() use queue_flag_clear_unlocked() even
though it needs to be locked sometimes
3/ conditionally use queue_flag_clear_unlocked if !t->queue_lock
