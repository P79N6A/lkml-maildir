That is the wrong design. That is basically just circumventing
zone balancing, and it shows because you don't balance slab vs
lowmem properly.
Lowmem pagecache vs highmem pagecache should be balanced correctly?
I think it is with your other patches.
Lowmem pagecache vs slab should be balanced correctly with my patch.
Therefore highmem vs slab will be balanced correctly.
Is that a good proof?
