Dear Developers,
1.) I have tried it with all recently available debian kernels from 
backports.org. It is the same game playing around. 
2.) I have actualy no other device connected to the hub. It is connected to a 
external power supply and this supply is working properly. I do not think 
that a card reader is consuming more power than a a usb port can give. 
So my opinion stays clear, but if you want to have more information and 
confirmation, please contact those who have (or had) the same problem as 
shown in various internet sites or forums.
My guess is, that ehci does not fall back to usb 1.1 support. Maybe that this 
is a follow up to to hubs not working the way, they should. But I  think that 
is not the linux way to accept it, like w*******s  does. That's why I'm using 
linux.
