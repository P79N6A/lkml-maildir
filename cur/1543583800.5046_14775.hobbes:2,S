   I already sent this patch some days ago, but didn't get an answer :(
   So, i'm trying to resubmit it.
Thanks for submitting it; the general idea of the patch looks good, but
as prumpf pointed out, the test for ioremap is reversed, so it looks 
like it hasn't been tested.
I'll fix it up and send it on to Linus.
