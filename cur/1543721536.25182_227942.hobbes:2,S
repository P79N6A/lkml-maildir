The code looks pretty neat to me, there's a few issues I'd like to see
addresses but that doesn't make sense before the 2.4 support is dropped
and there's an actual LLDD for 2.6.  But I think for most interesting
scenarios in the storage virtualization world your driver is pretty much
useless because it wants to dispatch directly to a scsi device and doesn't
go through the block layer.  So no fancy volume managers/etc there to make
interesting storage virtualization boxes.
