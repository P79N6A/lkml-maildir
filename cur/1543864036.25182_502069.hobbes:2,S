More prefisely, for this to work, we should change :
#define ATOMIC_PREFIX atomic
and
#define ATOMIC_PREFIX local
for
#define ATOMICF(fctname) atomic_##fctname
and
#define ATOMICF(fctname) local_##fctname
which would make de declaration look like :
static __inline__ ATOMICF(add_return)(int i, ATOMIC_TYPE *v)
Which starts to look a little odd to me, doesn't it ?
Regards,
Mathieu
