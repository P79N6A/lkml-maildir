Alan is hardly a marketing front man for anything in here.  I
don't know why you'd make such a comment.  Alan is a very
important part of kernel development and maintenance.  Pot shots
at him over such a trivial issue are pointless indeed.

Feel free to design such a system.  I'm sure the developers would
love to use it, and would very much appreciate your efforts to
give back into the Linux community for all it has given you.

Just let us know when your system is ready, I'd be glad to beta
test it for you.  As it stands right now, people can roll their
own kernel to EVERY extent.  Patches are freely available
wherever their authors put them up for download.  Alan Cox
integrates several patches into his AC series of kernels, as well
as arca kernels being available and a number of others.  Andre
Hedrick has IDE patches available, and many others have patches
available as well.
Some people take many of the patches that are out there and
integrate them into a big mother-patch.  You can download these
and try them as well.
I believe Riley Williams, or someone on this list with a name
starting with "R" has collected the entire Linux kernel source
tarballs all into a huge CVS tree and made it available online,
and on CDR as well.  You could likely easily integrate other
patches into this tree too.

I don't see how gcc stagnation and egcs takeover pertains to
Linux at all.

Open-sourcing?  How much more "open source" can you GET?  The
linux kernel is probably the largest open source project that has
ever existed with such magnitude, and open development.  This
mailing list is proof of that.  Every kernel is released for
everyone to view, as are the prereleases in between ALL kernel
versions such as 2.2.x-pre1, pre2, etc...  In addition, most if
not all patches that are included in the pre patches, as well as
tonnes of others that don't get included for some reason or
another, are also posted to the list, and a lot of those are also
made available for download via web/ftp.
I can't see any reason why you think linux isn't as open
source as it gets - other than the possibility that you just have
not taken the time to open your eyes and research it thouroughly
before going off...
Another $0.02.
Linux IMHO _IS_ the true definition of open source.
