The specification that describes the link ("cookie") values in the
pirq table built by the BIOS is what needs to be described....  I'm not
sure you are looking at the correct docs.
And what what we're seeing in this thread, it looks like there are
two different types of SiS link values from two different BIOSen;
or perhaps one BIOS is using some of the link value bits for other
purposes.
