	So you suggest something like webNFS?. Perhaps is an action to study...

	This is my problem: I manage a students lab with 100+ NFS clients
and 4 binary apps NFS servers. Every client has a small ( about 400MB )
hard disk to store a tftp retrieved mini root filesystem ( about 20 MB ) 
and a swap. /usr /home, and so are nfs mounted. Specifically /usr is readonly 
and need to manage large apps ( Xserver, java compiler, netscape, and so) in 
a more efficient way than NFS cache offers ( some clients has only 16Mb RAM )
	You'll say: use coda . OK but our feeling is that coda is still
too unstable to manage about 1500+ users and 100+ clients in an "hostil"
environment such a students lab. Item more: we need quotas, file locking and
so that are still not supported in coda ( needed for the /home directory )
	So a hard disk cache for readonly netmounted filesystems seems the
ideal solution for us. Of course: using knfsd, 100Mb network, load balanced
servers, etc... neither servers nor network are now the problem. Just need
to improve eficiency in clients
