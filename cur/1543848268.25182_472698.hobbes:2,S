	Sure, no dispute here.  My argument point isn't that "vector of
scalars is inherently evil" (I'll leave that aside), it's that a
facility allowing or encouraging the format change or blowup is
unhealthy.

	Cool, we're together on that as well.  I know that we can't
fully prevent stupidity, but encouraging better behavior is something I
always try to do.

	Someone (hi, it's me) rather tried to overspecialize configfs.
It's intentionally not all things to all people.  Kitchen sinks cause
clogs, as it were.
	And I'm intentionally overzealous enforcing it.  Better I need
to be beat over the head before I accept a good idea than I accept bad
ones with an "eh?"
