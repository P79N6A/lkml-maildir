  Yes, they basically get guarantees as in writeback mode. As I wrote to
Mingming, I'm not sure how that is handled with current ordered-mode
handling because you cannot afford to do block allocation from the commit
code anyway. We could possibly do the allocation if we were sure that we
have enough credits in the transaction (but that currently isn't the case
since we really count the number of buffers dirtied on the account of
transaction handle and after the handle is dropped, we give back unused
credits to the transaction).

  No. But I think that it's better to do nobh ordered mode in a separate
patch. This one is complicated enough...

  Comment moved. How would you like to assert for inode being freed? Maybe
we could check jinode->i_transaction == commit_transaction. That should be
good enough.

  Correct me if I'm wrong but as far as I look into the write-out code, we
do just one-sweep scan of mapping when writing out dirty pages. So we could
possibly write out more than we need but at most the whole file. Oh, ok,
someone could be extending the file as well but we could fix that by
setting .range_end to the current i_size - that's actually a nice
optimization anyway so I've done that.

  Yes, but I guess that's for a separate patch. I'll add it to my todo :).

  Yes, of course.

  Probably we could do that - there are two places where we remove inode
from a transaction list (and these are the only ones interesting for
races). One is the commit code and the other one is
journal_release_jbd_inode(). We are safe from the second one because we
obviously hold a reference to the inode. The first one is more subtle but
if jinode->i_transaction == transaction, it is filed on the running
transaction's list from which we have handle and so commit code cannot
touch it. If jinode->i_next_transaction == transaction, then commit code
can change inode under us but it will file the inode to the running
transaction's list anyway so there's nothing to lose.
  Changed the code and added a big comment...

  Note that we write out blocks only if we truncate inode that is being
currently committed. I.e., it has been created in the previous transaction
and is truncated in the current one. Or did you mean something else?
