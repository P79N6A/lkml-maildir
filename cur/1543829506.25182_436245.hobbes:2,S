That works, thanks!
Back to the original problem - 2.6.17-mm1 UML not booting.  If you add
stderr=1 to the command line, you'll see this:
	timer_init : request_irq failed - errno = 38
	NET: Registered protocol family 2
	irq 0, desc: 081debe0, depth: 0, count: 0, unhandled: 0
	->handle_irq():  0808af80, handle_bad_irq+0x0/0x1b7
	->chip(): 081d9320, 0x81d9320
	->action(): 00000000
	   IRQ_NOPROBE set
	unexpected IRQ 00
	BUG: failure at include2/asm/hardirq.h:22/ack_bad_irq()!
	Kernel panic - not syncing: BUG!
which means that the genirq stuff needs UML work, which I was working
on anyway because UML could already be made to crash like this.
Except now, it always does.
