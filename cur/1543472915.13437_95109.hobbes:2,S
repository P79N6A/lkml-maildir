It doesn't work too well, though - try it and see what happens to the
config file after doing "make oldconfig" etc.
The proper fix is probably something like
	unset CONFIG_PCI_BIOS CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
	choice 'PCI access mode' \
		"BIOS		CONFIG_PCI_ACCESS_BIOS		\
		 Direct		CONFIG_PCI_ACCESS_DIRECT	\
		 Both		CONFIG_PCI_ACCESS_BOTH" CONFIG_PCI_ACCESS_BOTH
	if [ "$CONFIG_PCI_ACCESS_BIOS" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_PCI_ACCESS_BOTH" = "y" ]
	then
		define_bool CONFIG_PCI_BIOS y
	fi
	if [ "$CONFIG_PCI_ACCESS_DIRECT" = y -o "$CONFIG_PCI_ACCESS_BOTH" = "y" ]
	then
		define_bool CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT y
	fi
(note the "unset" and the different name spaces to make sure that we
don't get configuration confusion). 
I have _not_ tested the above, but I tested your previous patch and it
didn't work reliably. The above approach _should_ work, but if anybody
really wants to see this in the next kernel, please test it out and send
me a patch if/when it works..
