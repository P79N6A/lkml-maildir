Just to tangent a bit...  I've been meaning to throw out a public kudos 
to Sam, Kai, Roman and the other kbuild/kconfig hackers.  The 2.6 kbuild 
and kconfig system is a _huge_ improvement over 2.4.x.
These days I use
	echo "-sataN" > localversion
heavily, and it's been quite helpful.  The separation of src/obj 
directories, the default verbosity level, 'make allyesconfig', and the 
elimination of recursive Makefile invocations are just some of the 
things that stick out as positive improvements that impact me on a daily 
basis.
Thanks guys!
	Jeff
