This worked for me:
sed 's/_SH_/_SPARC64_/g' include/asm-sh/hw_irq.h >
include/asm-sparc64/hw_irq.h
make mrproper
cp ../.config .
make oldconfig
make dep && make

This warning is repeated for quite a good portion of the source files during
the make process, however the kernel seems to build correctly.  Haven't
tried a reboot though.. :-\
