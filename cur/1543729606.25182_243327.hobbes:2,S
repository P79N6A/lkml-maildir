For ext2 and ext3 it's safe to assume that they are 1024-byte aligned.
But it's possible that other filesystems are using these (awfully named)
functions.
Well.  I doubt if anyone is using the _atomic versions yet.

Sounds sane, as long as you get firmly notified when a poorly-aligned
address is fed in.
