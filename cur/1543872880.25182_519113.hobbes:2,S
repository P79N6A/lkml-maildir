Or drivers coudl verify that they still bound to the device they are
about to operate on (psmouse does this by taking a lock on device and
then checking if driver bound is the same address as psmouse). But I'd
rather get rid of all this clutter if we could sever sysfs access
after removing corresponding attributes.
