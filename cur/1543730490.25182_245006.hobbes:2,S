Subject: [PATCH] Make PERFCTR_VIRTUAL default in Kconfig match recommendation in help text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings,
A tiny patch to make PERFCTR_VIRTUAL default to Y to match the 
recommendation given in the help text. The help has a very clear "Say Y" 
recommendation and it doesn't make much sense to not enable this currently 
if PERFCTR is set, so it should default to Y, not N as it does currently.
Patch is against 2.6.8.1-mm4
