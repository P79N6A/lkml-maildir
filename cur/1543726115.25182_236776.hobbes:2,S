It is sufficient.
You didn't explain your example very well, but I'll assume it is the
following:
dirty NFS data -> NFS server on localhost -> ext3 filesystem.
So kswapd tries to reclaim some memory and writes out the dirty NFS
data. The NFS server then writes this data to ext3 (it can do this
because it is PF_MEMALLOC). The data gets written out, the NFS server
tells the client it is clean, kswapd continues.
Right?
