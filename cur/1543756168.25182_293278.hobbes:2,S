I have a MAGNEX/ViPower USB/FirWire external HD enclosure. I 
found that it works pretty fine (albeit slowly) when connected 
to the USB 1.1 ports built in my Dell Inspiron 8200, but trying 
to connect it via the Hamlet PCMCIA USB2 Card Adapter doesn't 
work (it seems it gets assigned minors 1,2,3,4,5,6,... and so 
on forever until I unplug it).
OTOH, I'm not sure if it's a PCMCIA adapter problem or USB2 
enclosure problem. Indeed, if I don't load the EHCI modules, 
and thus limit myself to the USB1.1 capabilities of the PCMCIA 
adapters, I get other errors (I'll have to write a cleaner bug 
report on this. And try the PCMCIA card with some other USB 
device. Wish I could use my softmodem under Linux :(). (Using 
kernel 2.6.10-3 from Debian.)
