This is also a display fifo issue. I think you need to get the display
fifo code in the 2.4 driver, I have been working with Geert in May to get
exactly the problem resolved on his VAIO, a Dell laptop I had temporarily
then had the problem too, it was because of lack of precision. It's likely
that Alexander didn't update his code yet.
