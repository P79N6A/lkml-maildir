Hi from Belgium,
I encounter several severe server crashes, mostly while dumping on 
SCSI tapes (HP DAT and HP DLT). This appear on 3 similar machines 
(that excludes hardware problem). Crash is severe because when they 
occur, the system is completely frozen, with a black console. No 
error message. I just need to switch off then on.
I never have had this problem when I was previously running 2.0.36 
kernel on same hardware.
- all  disks are SCSI
- SCSI card Adaptec 2940UW
- processor is AMD K6-266 MHz
- for 1 year now, I've been using several 2.4.x kernel versions (-> 2.17)
- last I've last tried kernel 2.17 patched with 
"linux-aic7xxx-6.2.5-2.4.17.patch"
(cf. 
http://people.freebsd.org/~gibbs/linux/
)
- glibc 2.2.2-10,  X is not running
