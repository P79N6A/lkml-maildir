  Yes. Only one of compatible interfaces is allowed. The reason is
mainly due to QUOTAON. Both V1 and V2 interfaces used Q_QUOTAON
to turn quotas on (looking back I admit it was stupid but it happened).
So now we would have to recognize which quota file was actually given
to us and turn on proper quota format - and I dislike such magic in
kernel.. especially when it's not needed. When user has really old
quota tools (<=2.00) he will turn on V1 interface. If he has newer tools
(<3.05) he has to decide depending on format he wants to use... 3.05
and newer don't use this interface. Actually the easiest is always to
upgrade quota tools :) and this compatible interface mess is there
mainly due to possibility of backport into 2.4 kernels...
