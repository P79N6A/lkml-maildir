I'll answer the question that your question raises :)
I don't want to remove VIA support from hw_random the instant that 
support is added to rngd.
Rather, that would be the first step in phasing VIA RNG support out of 
the kernel.  The second step would be printing a one-time warning, 
noting the VIA support is deprecated, and that we will not be adding any 
code it.  The third step, probably when 2.7 opens, is to then remove the 
VIA support from hw_random.
