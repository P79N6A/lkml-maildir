No, sorry, it doesn't look so for me. They are about performance, but 
I'm asking about the overall project's architecture, namely about one 
part of it: simplicity. Particularly, what do you think about 
duplicating Linux page cache in the user space to have zero-copy cached 
I/O? Or can you suggest another architectural solution for that problem 
in the STGT's approach?
