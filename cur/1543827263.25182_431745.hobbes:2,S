Andrew,
the dust has settled. Please add the following updates to genirq.
The simple one is to allow the usage of no_irq_chip for real dumb
PICs.
The deadlock problems seen by Russell on neponset and also by Kevin 
on omap turned out to be reentrancy problems. The original ARM 
implementation had no reentrancy check in the simple_irq handler 
and the network driver magically did not break when the interrupt 
handler was reentered. ARM related fixups are seperate.
