That part of RTAI which uses the patented process is GPLed. Other parts,
which don't, are LGPL. Don't spread vague assumptions - tell us where you
think to have found a license violation or be quiet. It's not very helpful
to tell things in public which are simply not true.

You blame the RTAI developers for license violations without any proof.
