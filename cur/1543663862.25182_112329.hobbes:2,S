This was my change. Obviously the warning is a good idea in general,
but I don't see the point of scrolling through hundreds of lines
with the same warning in someone else's code. I actually plan to fix
these warnings in arch/s390 and drivers/s390 as well as include/
and make the s390 kernel compile with -Werror, but the rest looks 
more like a task for the Janitors. Note that before gcc-3.3, 
-Wsign-compare has not been part of -Wall.
