I didn't say we would *have* to put a conditional jump in there.  But I don't
know that I it can be avoided on all archs.
I don't know that sparc32 can do conditional instructions for example.  If we
force this assumption it becomes a potential limitation on the archs we can
support.  OTOH, it may be that every arch that supports SMP and has to emulate
bitops with spinlocks also supports conditional stores; but I don't know that.
