I think anyone should be able to supply a Reviewed-by: tag no matter
who they are.  Of course the weight that such a tag carries in the
final decision of whether or not to merge may depend on who supplied
it, but I don't think we should try to formalize that aspect.
In other words, I would define Reviewed-by: as just "I have looked at
this patch in depth."  Jon's text seems like a really good summation
of that idea in more explicit language.
