Um, rather than one macro per security_ops function, how about:
#ifdef CONFIG_SECURITY
	#define security_call(func, default_ret, ...) \
		(security_ops->func(__VA_ARGS__))
#else
	#define security_call(func, default_ret, ...) \
		(default_ret)
#endif
This also allows someone in the future to do:
	#define security_call(func, default_ret, ...) \
		({ if (try_inc_mod_count(security_ops->owner))
			(security_ops->func(__VA_ARGS__));
		   else
			(default_ret);
		})
Of course, you could skip the default_ret arg, and use
#ifndef CONFIG_SECURITY
	#define security_call(func, ...) \
		(security_default_##func)
#endif
Then all the defaults can be in a header somewhere.
Cheers,
Rusty.
