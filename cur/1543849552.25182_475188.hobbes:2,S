That way I have my own private playground where I can mess around with
patches, prototype new ideas, etc. It also serves as my local repository of
patches I got from other folks. I treat ocfs2.git as a 'public' repository,
so I don't want to pollute it with junk branches, etc.

Yeah. I just remove it after the merge and re-create later, but I could just
fast-forward it if I wanted to. I guess it's personal preference - it
doesn't really cost me much to re-create the for-linus branch.

Yep. ALL is essentially a throwaway branch. Keep in mind that the topic
branches don't get thrown out until they've been merged upstream.
Typically people aren't pulling continuously from ALL. Most patches are
against Linus' tree - I take it as part of my "job" to handle merging stuff
into ALL.

Yes, generally you now have the responsibility of deciding what patches in
your git tree are appropriate to be pushed upstream at any given time :)
There are rules that people should follow of course, which Linus outlined
earlier in this thread.
Good Luck!
