Yes, well, I guess that was my initial thinking, which is why it got
coded that way. But "in real life", the value in the struct isn't
initialized (thus taking a value of zero). Its not initialized 
in deference to the traditional idea that "just saying bzero() 
should be enough".  
However, that turned the test for error into a dorky double test:
if(pdev->error_state && pdev->error_state != pci_channel_io_normal)
which struck me as lame. 
So, I'll ask: is it better to test for (state!=0 && state!=1) or,
to initialize pdev->error_state = pci_channel_io_normal; in the driver 
probe code?
