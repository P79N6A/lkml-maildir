No, that would be surprising behaviour. O_NOATIME means the atime
shouldn't be changed -- no more, no less. Nothing prevents me from doing
complex read patterns on the file while using O_NOATIME (for instance,
if I know the internal format of the file, I might use a random access
pattern, read parts of the file more than once, or something like that).
If you want drop-behind, you should be able to say it explicitly (and in
fact most people would probably want it but not O_NOATIME -- for
instance, a media player, after reading the headers, reads the file
mostly in sequence). I believe that would work better as a fcntl (since
you would want to read the headers before setting it to sequential).
