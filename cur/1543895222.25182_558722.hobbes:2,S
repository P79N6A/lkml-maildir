I don't think that is what is going on. If you connect a USB 1.1 device 
to a USB 2.0 hub, the USB 2.0 controller can still talk to it at high 
speed using the EHCI controller, since the USB 2.0 hub has a transaction 
translator for low and full speed devices. This is as designed and 
should work (though it's possible there's a bug somewhere).
Are you sure that USB 2.0 hub is actually working properly, and can 
supply adequate power for that card reader? (I've seen some crap hubs 
that identify themselves as self-powered with 500mA per port, but a) it 
still lists this even if the AC adapter is not plugged in and therefore 
is actually bus-powered with far less power available, and b) even if it 
was plugged in, the AC adapter is far too weak to actually be able to 
supply this much power..)
