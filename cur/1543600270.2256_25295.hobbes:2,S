	Yes, but even if the module is GPL'd, the module could still cost $1,000
and you're not entitled to the source if you didn't buy the module. If what
you want is "source code is available to the general public", then that can
be true or false for both GPL'd and non-GPL'd modules.
	If you make it 'must have been compiled from source on this machine" then
you know that at least this person has access to the source. If you make it
"source code must be publically avialable" then you know developers have
access to the  source. But the answer to both of these can be "yes" or "no"
for both GPL'd and non-GPL'd modules.
	What do you really want? Code that.
