According to the comments in 2.4, this code causes the NMI to be 
re-asserted if another NMI occurred while the NMI handler was running.  
I have no idea how twiddling with these CMOS registers causes this to 
happen, but that is supposed to be the intent.  I don't think it has 
anything to do with delays.
I would like to know what this code really does before removing it.
