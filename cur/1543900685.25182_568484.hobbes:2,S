Nothing specific.  I usually just throw various workloads at it, both 
throughput-intensive, seek-intensive, multiple threads at the same time, 
stressing multiple disks at the same time, etc.
I presume from your past messages your tests include multiple disks at 
the same time?

hehehe Well I sorta didn't want to mention it, to avoid clouding the 
waters further.
In theory, hotplug and hot unplug -should- work, in version 7.  Your 
report is a useful contradiction of that theory, and signals where to 
poke next.  Since all this hacking is a spare-time effort, so promises 
as to when next I'll poke at it.   It might be tomorrow, or a month from 
now.  Getting "new EH" upstream was a big hurdle to overcome, and your 
testing really helped that along.
Anyway, something like Version 7 is probably what I will push upstream 
for 2.6.23-rc1.
