Currently (2.6.0-test2) i2c-viapro and via686a don't work together -
you can use only one of them. This is because they want to work with
the same PCI device - and having multiple drivers for one device is
not allowed for obvious reasons.
This issue is already known to the lm_sensors developers.
So you will need to remove i2c-viapro for now (but leave i2c-isa);
then you will see the via686a sensors again.
