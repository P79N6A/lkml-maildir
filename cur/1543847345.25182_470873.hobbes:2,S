I agree with that completely, but it was not me
who started adding the ld.so-specific tricks to
the kernel, making it special.
The assumptions of the current mmap check are:
1. The program does mmap with PROT_EXEC, not mmap/mprotect
(it was explicitly pointed out that this is unlikely to change).
2. The program does the file-backed mmap, not the anon
mmap then read.
That suits ld.so very well because it happened to work that
way, but it is not very usefull for pretty much anything else
(unless someone can show the real-life examples).
So this is what makes ld.so special. Right now it checks
exec/noexec by trying mmap(PROT_EXEC) and see if that fails.
But there can be other ways to check that, including the ones
that will not break the other progs/configurations.
And I don't see any harm in having a way for the program
to explicitly say whether it wants an exec perm or not.
(access() suits exactly for that, but it is racey)

But you can't do that - lets be realistic. Also I wonder
whether it will violate the posix specs or not.

Certainly.

Yes, that assumption is wrong, but it was not me who
invented it. I only want to move the ld.so-specific
stuff to ld.so itself, nothing more.
