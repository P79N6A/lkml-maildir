I would much rather merge it now (assuming I didn't break ecryptfs)
and have you unionfs developers fix it later :-).

Yes, we discussed this with Jeff already. For unionfs, we must make it
more dynamic. However, using slab unconditionally makes it totally
unacceptable for ecryptfs. Therefore, we need a small static array
that should satisfy most user (I think we can drop the static array
size to three):
struct stackfs_inode_info {
    struct inode **hidden_inodes;
    struct inode *static_inodes[3];
};
Initially, hidden_inodes can point to static_inodes which we can the
replace with a dynamic array if required. Btw, we probably want to do
krealloc() for that in the slab allocator.
