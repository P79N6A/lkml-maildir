fsck, this is non-ending... obviously, this is insufficient:
preempt_count will equal two if the BKL was previously held and
in_atomic() will trip.
This should work:
	if (likely(!kernel_locked())
		tsk->lock_depth = -2;
	else {
		/* compensate for BKL; we still cannot preempt */
		preempt_enable_no_resched();
	}
look sane?
Now, remind me why this is all worth it...
