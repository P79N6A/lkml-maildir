That is a really upsetting US/ASCII/English-centric view. How would you
feel if the prevalent, "standard" character set didn't include 'h' and
_your_ name showed up as "Albert D. Ca=68alan" elsewhere?!
That your MUA is RFC-compliant is nice, but in this case the RFC was
shortsighted. My MUA and MTA are at least able to handle Latin-1 (and
probably other charsets too, never tried).
