That's because the oom killer needs to kill a task that will allow future 
memory freeing on current->mems_allowed in these cases.  Appropriate 
oom_adj scores can override that preference, it's up to the administrator.

It doesn't work with any system that is running with cpusets, that's the 
problem with accepting such code.  There needs to be clear and convincing 
evidence that a userspace oom notifier, which could handle all possible 
cases and is much more robust and flexible, would not suffice for such 
situations.

How do I prioritize oom killing if my system is running cpusets, then?  
Your answer is that I can't, since this new cgroup doesn't work with them; 
so this solution is incomplete.  The oom killer notification patch[*] is 
much more functional and does allow this problem to be solved on all types 
of systems because the implementation of such a handler is left to the 
administrator.

The userspace handler is a schedulable task resident in memory that, with 
any sane implementation, would not require additional memory when running.

We've used it quite successfully for over a year, so your hypothesis in 
this case may be less than accurate.

If your system failed to allocate GFP_ATOMIC memory, then those are page 
allocation failures in the buddy allocator and will actually never invoke 
the oom killer since it cannot sleep in that context.
