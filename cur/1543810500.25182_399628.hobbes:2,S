Does it?  Shouldn't the tools export this information too, if it really
should belong in the pci_id structure?
So, is _every_ pci driver going to have to be modified to support this
new field if they are supposed to work on this kind of hardware?  If so,
that doesn't sound like a good idea.  Any way we can just set the bit in
the pci arch specific code for the devices instead?

For some drivers, they need that driver_data field to be set.  Just
wanting to make sure that this also is needed.
