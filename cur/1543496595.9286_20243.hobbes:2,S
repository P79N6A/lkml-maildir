Hi,
I upgraded my system to 2.2.9 today (together with a hardware upgrade),
and now I see three stange things:
1) klogd is using 99% cpu-time after booting
2) running ZDnet's webbench shows a curve like this (ascii-art :-)
   (Y = requests/sec, X = number of client-threads)
     +
    +  +++
   +       ++++
  +
  1  4  8  (clients)
while with 2.2.6 it was just saturating (instead of declining). The drop
in performance is significant: from 150 req's/sec to 110 req/seq when
changing from 4 to 8 clients. (this happened both with apache as with my
 in-kernel httpd, although the apache numbers are lower, 104 and 61).
3) Under very heavy load (webbench with 40+ client-threads), the machine
  just locked up (using apache as a webserver).
Does anybody know what is going on here?
Greetings,
  Arjan van de Ven
