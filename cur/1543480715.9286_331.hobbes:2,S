Hi,
It looks to me like there's a typo in pc_keyb.c line 747. I think
	if (val == 0x5a && (status & KBD_STAT_MOUSE_OBF))
should be.
   if (val != 0x5a && (status & KBD_STAT_MOUSE_OBF))
This is what I had to do to get pre8 to detect my aux port anyway.
(outputing 0x5a then checking for it after input is a test to ensure
that we're talking to something other than latches yes?)
	-Mike
