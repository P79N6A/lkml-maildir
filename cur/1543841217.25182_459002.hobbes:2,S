Hi,
I want to write a driver that will handle multiple devices. These
devices will share the IRQ line. Do I need to register my (same)
interrupt handler as many times as the number of devices(by calling
request_irq())?
Also an unrelated query. Can I sleep after a call to preempt_kernel()??
TIA,
Rick
