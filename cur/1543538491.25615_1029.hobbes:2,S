I agree with Juhana; the interesting figure is 7 ms. The reason for
this is that if 7 ms happens often enough to be registered within the
period of a normal benchmark/test, then it's happening way too often!
7 ms has to be regarded as the practical worst case latency, and it's
too much even if it was guaranteed never to occur twice within say, 5
seconds. (Allowing RT thread to catch up so that another 7 ms peak
doesn't generate a drop-out.) Once in a few weeks may be acceptable.
Once in 10 hrs, and we don't have a seriously usable solution.
