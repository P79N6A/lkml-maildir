I think there is. We have a userspace visible change to the sched
affinity API when the cpusets option is enabled. Papering over it with a
udev callback doesnt sound like the right solution.
Im struggling to understand why we have this problem at all. If a task
has not been touched by cpuset calls it should be allowed to use any
cpu. I completely agree that once you have partitioned the task with
cpusets then it should never spill onto more recently hotplug added
cpus.
