I send a SIGINT via keyboard to a program that uses posix threading,
but I get a strange behavior where the process doesn't immediately
terminate as soon as the keyboard prompt return.
The thread within that process seems to keep running for a few seconds
after I expect the main process to have terminated.
Is this a known problem ?
