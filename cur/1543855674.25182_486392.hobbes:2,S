I disagree with this.
readl() returns values from an opaque source, and it is declared
as such to show this to GCC.  It's like a function that GCC
cannot see the implementation of, which it cannot determine
anything about wrt. return values.
The volatile'ness does not simply disappear the moment you
assign the result to some local variable which is not volatile.
Half of our drivers would break if this were true.
