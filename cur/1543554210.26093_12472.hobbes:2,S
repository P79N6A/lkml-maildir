I have dual T1 lines going into the box, and I just added a 4-way ADSL
circuit as well (4 x 550K).  Claus claimed there were TCPIP timeout bugs
in Linux (which we have now disproved).  Even despite the limits being
low, a "sendmail -v -q" command should always force delivery, and this
wasn't even working right.  This box gets hammered day and night with
FTP activity.  Had to upgrade since I learned when you post a free Linux
distriution, everyone beats a path to your door.
