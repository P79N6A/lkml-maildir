I have this:
/dev/hda6               /                       ext2    defaults        1 1
/dev/hda1               /boot                   ext2    defaults        1 2
/dev/hda5               /usr/local/apache/logs  ext2    defaults        1 3
/dev/md0                /home                   ext2    defaults,usrquota 1 0
/dev/sda1               swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
/dev/sdb1               swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
/md0 was in 4. now it is 0
it was very very slow between 80% & 95% then it was very quick.
doing it handly it is very quick all time:
/dev/md0              17251748   9969024   6406384  61% /home

so why fsck making handly is quicker ?
