I think that there is a miss understanding here.  The kernel timers, 
at this time, do not know or care about daylight savings time.  This 
is not really a clock set but a time zone change which does not 
intrude on the kernels notion of time (that being, more or less UTC).

As far as timers go, it is only the user who understands any 
abstraction above the second.  I.e. hour, day, min. all are 
abstractions done in user land.
There is, however, one exception, the leap second.  The kernel inserts 
this at midnight UTC and does use a fixed constant (86400) to find 
midnight.

I think what we are saying is that ABS time flag says that the timer 
is supposed to expire at the given time "by the specified clock", 
however that time is arrived at, be it the initial time or the initial 
time plus one or more intervals.  We are NOT saying that these 
intervals are the same size, but only that the given clock says that 
they are the same size, thus any clock setting done during an interval 
can cause that interval to be of a different size.
Without the ABS time flag, we are talking about intervals (the initial 
and subsequent) that are NOT affected by clock setting and are thus as 
close to the requested duration as possible.

This is why the standard introduced the ABS time flag.  It does NOT, 
however, IMHO touch on the issue of time zone changes introduced by 
shifting into and out of day light savings time.
