We know it during the insertion. But we need a new field struct print_entry.
That makes me remind that I didn't considered the TRACE_CONT rest of
the buffer in this patch.
Actually, the most easy solution would be to print entirely the buffer
to the seq, and then delete
the newline directly to the seq. That would be a bit crappy but
actually the only solution.
So my patch is wrong in cases of long messages.
