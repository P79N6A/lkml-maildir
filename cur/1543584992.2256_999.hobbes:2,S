I have a Asus K7V motherboard and a SB 128 PCI soundcard.
The motherboard is vt82c686a based.
The SB is a ES1371/AC97 card, seemingly identical to the onboard sound on
this type of motherboard.
However, the sound rarely works, and there are problems with the parport
too.
Sound does not work (usually, I have had it work, but I can't reproduce
it). The parport behaves strangely.
Here is dmesg output:

lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
I don't know why it prints it twice.
When printing errors are printed (buffer overrun or something like that,
it seems RedHat only logs these damn things to console).
Also if I try to disbale interrupt driven printing I get an error:
[root@dogfox log]# /usr/sbin/tunelp /dev/printers/0 -i 0
tunelp: ioctl: Invalid argument
/dev/printers/0 using IRQ 7
With sound, I get:
es1371: version v0.27 time 00:47:56 Mar  7 2001
es1371: found chip, vendor id 0x1274 device id 0x1371 revision 0x08
PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:0b.0
es1371: found es1371 rev 8 at io 0xa400 irq 10
es1371: features: joystick 0x0
ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: 0x0000:0x0000 (Unknown)
Where the id field obviously should not be zero.
The IRQ, DMA, I/O ports etc. are all the same as they are in Windows, but
in Linux the sound doesn't work and the printer keeps hanging.
I also get spurios interrupts on 7 when the parport is not loaded.
I know other people are seeing similar effects with sinilar hardware, but
to my knowledge there have been no solutions put forward.
If anyone has any ideas I can try to diagnose this problem more clearly
or wants any specific information, please ask.
