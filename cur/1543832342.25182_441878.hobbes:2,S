ACK.
Given that:
- this tie is permanent due to fundamental design disagreements
- swsusp, uswsusp and Suspend2 can coexist in the same tree
- Nigel has a track record of excellent support for his code
Why not make another kernel subsystem (Suspend2) and make Nigel
maintainer of it? Then all this nonsense can stop and distributions and
users can pick what they really want.
Andrew? Linus?
