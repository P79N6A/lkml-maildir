Alas there is some userspace breakage:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177199
| Ethernet over firewire devices (driver: eth1394) have - starting with
kernel
| 2.6.21 - no longer a proper parent-device/subsystem in sysfs.
|
| The code change resulting in this is:
[...]
| This missing parent-device breaks persistence-net, as that adds
DRIVERS=="?*"
| to the generated rules, but the driver-attribute resides in the
parent-device
| that no longer is available now.
|
| This leads to not matching the existing rule, but at every boot
running into
| the code to get a new number for the interface, and thus enlarging the
ruleset
| with one line at every boot.
I didn't notice this problem on my own Gentoo box here.  But then I
rarely reboot and don't automatically load eth1394 anymore since I
applied a post-2.6.21 patch which uncouples ieee1394 from eth1394.  I
still load it manually for frequent testing though.
