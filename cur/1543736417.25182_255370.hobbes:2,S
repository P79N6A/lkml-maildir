Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking too: header & metadata in plain
text, data proper encrypted. Fits perfectly with suspend's current modus
operandi too.

There must be some way of being able to check the password is correct
without compromising security by encrypting static text and storing it
at a known location! Darned if I know what it is though.

Perhaps it will help here to say that suspend plays nicely with swapping
at the moment. All of the implementations use the normal swap allocation
routines to get and free the pages they write to, and they also only
change (reverseably) the ten-character header on the header page (not
the data itself). (The SWAP-SPACE or SWAPSPACE2 sig). You thus don't
have to re-mkswap after suspending. Writing the image is done using
submit_bio, not the swapspace specific routines.
