Given that sysctl_sched_wakeup_granularity is set to 10ms by default,
this doesn't sound abnormal.

The reason why we are getting better wakeup latencies for !FAIR_USER_SCHED is 
because of this snippet of code in place_entity():
	if (!initial) {
		/* sleeps upto a single latency don't count. */
		if (sched_feat(NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS) && entity_is_task(se))
						     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
			vruntime -= sysctl_sched_latency;
		/* ensure we never gain time by being placed backwards. */
		vruntime = max_vruntime(se->vruntime, vruntime);
	}
NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS feature gives credit for sleeping only to tasks and
not group-level entities. With the patch attached, I could see that wakeup 
latencies with FAIR_USER_SCHED are restored to the same level as 
!FAIR_USER_SCHED. 
However I am not sure whether that is the way to go. We want to let one group of
tasks running as much as possible until the fairness/wakeup-latency threshold is
exceeded. If someone does want better wakeup latencies between groups too, they 
can always tune sysctl_sched_wakeup_granularity.
