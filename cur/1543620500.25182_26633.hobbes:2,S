yes.

no. I saw ext2_get_block() overhead in other workloads, but not this one.
(this was a fully cached pagecache-only workload.)

no, i simply had code that called llseek() pretty often for the same inode
(big database file), and on multiple CPUs it was just way too easy for one
semaphore user to cause another one to block.

oh, that is a really cool thing!
llseek() is unrelated, and i think pretty gross. Is there any other reason
to llseek()'s i_sem usage other than the 64-bit atomic update of the file
offset value? We can do lockless, SMP-correct 64-bit updates on x86 pretty
easily.
