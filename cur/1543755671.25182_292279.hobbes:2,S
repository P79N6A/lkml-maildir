I still see legousbtower registered in drivers/usb/misc/legousbtower.c.
Are you sure about these changes? Also, do the names in this document
match the names registered with sysfs (new mga_* stuff etc)?
I found a few sysfs entries that differ from devices.txt:
# misc devices
# 183 = /dev/hwrng        Generic random number generator
KERNEL="hw_random",     NAME="hwrng", SYMLINK="%k"
# 219 = /dev/modems/mwave MWave modem firmware upload
KERNEL="mwave",         NAME="modems/%k"
# 169 = /dev/specialix_rioctl Specialix RIO serial control
KERNEL="rioctl",        NAME="specialix_rioctl", SYMLINK="%k"
# 167 = /dev/specialix_sxctl Specialix serial control
KERNEL="sxctl",         NAME="specialix_sxctl", SYMLINK="%k"
