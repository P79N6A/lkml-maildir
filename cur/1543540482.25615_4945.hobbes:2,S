I'm compiling my 2.2 kernels ever since gcc-2.95.2 came out without any
problems, so the "gcc-2.95.2 cannot compile 2.2.x kernels" cannot apply
to many of the subsystems that I'm using. No crashes, no lockups that
are not hardware-related, no oopses. So why should I use egcs 1.1.2 if
2.95.2 does the job? There is no reason NOT to use that latest gcc
release.
In turn, if 2.96alpha breaks the kernel, then somebody should have a
look if it's the compiler or the kernel, and in case file a bug report,
the earlier, the better. But that's an entirely different issue than
shipping an alpha gcc with Red Hat's RawHide.
