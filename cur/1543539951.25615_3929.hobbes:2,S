SA_INTERRUPT is deprecated, as it fundamentally cannot work with shared
interrupts (or at least they all have to _agree_ on SA_INTERRUPT, which
basically means that you have to know exactly the type of sharing. Ugh).
And non-shared interrupts are _definitely_ deprecated, unless the hardware
really forces you to use them. That kind of hardware is getting quite
rare. Thank God.
That said, SA_INTERRUPT still works, but it's really only meant to be used
for the timer handler (you don't want the timer to be interruptible: it's
fast, and at least the SCSI layer historically wanted the timer to tick
_while_ a SCSI interrupt is active, so you must not have a SCSI interrupt
interrupt the timer, because if that happens..)
