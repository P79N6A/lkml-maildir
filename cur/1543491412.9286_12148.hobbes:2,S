Hi,
  Here are a few comments on the v2.2.1 distribution. I don't know if
it applies to v2.2.(2-5) versions. I haven't gotten there yet. :)
A)
The linux 2.2.1 distribution README is missing the comments on the
    symbolic links in /usr/include
        i.e.
                cd /usr/include
                rm -rf asm linux scsi
                ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386 asm
 	        ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/linux linux
                ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/scsi scsi
B).   Need to mention this also in the README for Linux beginners
      I would think. Something along these lines about the subdirectories
      for new libc's overwriting the same ones that the linux src tree
      includes are in.
Note: The Linux source tree can be installed before these links are put
       in. However, these links must be there if one is installing a
       precompiled binary libc6 library since some of the asm, linux and
       scsi include files are part of the libc distribution.
       The linux source tree should be installed after the libc6 installation
       due to some of the include files being overwritten with possible
       older versions in the libc6. I don't think this should break the
       libc6 distribution but the linux kernel may be. As far as include
       files that aren't used or show up in the linux source tree from
       libc, it may be ignored at this time - but will need later cleanup
       later.
