I think we can break these down into low level and higher level interrupt 
enabling. Lower level tends to be call sites like exception entry, in that 
particular case drivers aren't aware of the interrupt enable/disable 
semantics so it's safe to enable without dispatch. Higher up is where 
dispatch makes sense and we can closer mimick hardware.

The aforementioned should allow us not to have to do a driver audit.

I believe it certainly is worth seperating and would help in the iret, in 
that you could enable interrupts without recursing again.
