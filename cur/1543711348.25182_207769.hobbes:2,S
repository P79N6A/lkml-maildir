Hello,
I am using Red Hat Linux 7.3, Kernel is 2.4.18-3smp and kernel 2.4.18-3
under Intel HT processor. 
Is there any difference between SMP Makefile and non SMP Makefile. I
have Makefile for non SMP system. What macros OR what flags can I add to
the existing Makefile to compile it on 2.4.18-3smp kernel. It is working
fine under 2.4.18-3 kernel that is non-SMP system.
Thanks in advance.
