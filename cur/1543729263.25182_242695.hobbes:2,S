Hi there guys,
I've been pondering on posting about this for a long time but I guess
I'll just go and say it. I've been reading the lkml for about a year now
and, I don't know how important it is to you, but I think that typos in
the comments in the kernel sources really annoy those who really read
them in order to understand what's going on. Well, I'm one of them, and,
since the typos are really a lot, I thought that maybe fixing them would
be a good idea.
Here's a patch. Please, tell me if you don't want such noise on the list
but I think that, although not crucial, somewhat correct english in the
comments would be better, or?
Regards,
Boris
