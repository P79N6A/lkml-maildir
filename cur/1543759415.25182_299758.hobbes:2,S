Yes, really tenuous stuff.  Very glad if this is the fix!

Right.  I don't know why journal_put_journal_head() looks at
->b_transaction, really.  Should have made presence on a list contribute to
b_jcount.  Oh well, it's been that way since 2.5.0 or older..
Don't we have the same race anywhere where we're doing a
journal_refile_buffer() (or equiv) in parallel with a
journal_put_journal_head() outside locks?  There seem to be many such.
Perhaps we could also fix this by elevating b_jcount whenever the jh is
being moved between lists?
