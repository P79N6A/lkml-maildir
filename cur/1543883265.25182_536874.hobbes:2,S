well, sure, but if someone chooses to use a tool incorrectly, there's
really no way to stop them.  and i'm guessing that that sort of thing
would be quickly self-correcting based on peer pressure.  incorrectly
tagged features should become obvious fairly quickly when builds start
to break in unexpected ways.

no, it's not just presentational markup.  it's also a selection or
filtering utility, which i consider distinct from markup.  maybe we're
just disagreeing on semantics, so let's not flog this distinction.

in a previous discussion, the definitions were pretty much as follows:
* deprecated:  while a feature is still supported, its use is
discouraged because there is a better alternative that you should
consider migrating to at your convenience.
* obsolete:  while a feature is still in the tree, it is no longer
supported and no one should need it anymore, and everyone *should* be
using the better alternative at this point.
IMHO, there is a clear distinction between those two definitions.
they are not orthogonal, they are mutually exclusive.  put another
way, there is an obvious timeline for features:
  normal -> deprecated -> obsolete
quite simply, based on the above, you can't be deprecated and obsolete
at the same time.
in any event, i don't want to drag this out too much longer.  i think
the proposal is reasonably clear, now it remains to be seen if enough
people think it's worth implementing.
