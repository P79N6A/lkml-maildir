I can not copy the oops message, so I just hand copy something here:
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000001
IP: [<c0527636>] kset_find_obj+0x3b/0x5c
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP
[snip...]
EIP is at kset_find_obj+0x3b/0x5c
EAX:00000001
[snip...]
Call Trace:
driver_register
destruct_tty_driver
usb_serial_bus_register
usb_serial_register
aircable_init
_stext
aircable_init
restore_nocheck_notrace
pci_arch_init
[snip...]
Actually, after the usb_serial_init failed, the usb_serial_bus_type
will be unregistered.
So when  serial dirvers call usb_serial_register (then
usb_serial_bus_register, and then driver_register),  due to the bus
kset already unregistered kernel will oops.
