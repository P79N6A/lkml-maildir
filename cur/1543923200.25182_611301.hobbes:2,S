I'm fairly sure that this originates with 2.6.21 as it looks very similar to
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8519
which I filed at that time and which I traced to 8030f54499925d07.
I've never been convinced that that change was correct, but as it now "works
for me" due to changes in the Debian default configuration files, I decided
to not follow up.
Of course, not honoring 'all' is more obviously a bug than not honoring
'default' for existing interfaces.
I've added a comment to #8519.
Hope this helps,
Frans Pop
