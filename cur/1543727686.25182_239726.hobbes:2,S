Right, the process running (...) would not know what offset to give "cat b" 
as a start, because it cannot see "cat a"'s final offset. It could seek to 
the end of /tmp/foo before starting "cat b", but this requirement would 
break existing shells. Bad luck.
As there are probably more examples why it does not work, there will 
probably have to be a macro for all offset changes, which checks for 
overruns.
