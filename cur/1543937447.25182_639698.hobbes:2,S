Can this also be done for executables?

[But it may very well mean improper usage (e.g. passing NULL where
NULL is definitely not expected) on behalf of the library user ;-)]

Previously, one had to ptrace the process, wait for the crash to
happen, then inspect /proc/XXX/maps and calculate the address. It's
not like developers were left in the dark with random mappings.
