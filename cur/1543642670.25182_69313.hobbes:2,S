Hi Bert,
   I'd presume the reason for that would be because the irq/pin mappings end up in a manner that all the devices end up having the same irq assigned to the pin they're using. This would be a BIOS/fw problem, although it can be alleviated with PCI IRQ router support for that particular chipset.
