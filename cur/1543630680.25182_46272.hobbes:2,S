Hello
I have serial card with Oxford chipset OX16PCI954-TQC60-A1
It's identify as "Titan Electronics VScom 400H 4 port serial adaptor"
vendor_id: 14d2:a003
I can set speed port to 921600 or 3000000 bits/s, but I would like
set speed precisely to:
1843200 bits/s
3684400 bits/s
2681018 bits/s
or
2268554 bits/s
but I can't because we have in include/asm-i386/termbits.h defines:
#define   B921600 0010007
#define  B1000000 0010010
#define  B1152000 0010011
#define  B1500000 0010012
#define  B2000000 0010013
#define  B2500000 0010014
#define  B3000000 0010015
#define  B3500000 0010016
#define  B4000000 0010017
How I can do that? Please help me. :-) Thank You!
