I did this long time ago (on a 2.4 kernel), trying to avoid a hardware
problem. I re-ordered the zones so that ZONE_DMA came after
ZONE_NORMAL. Since the DMA memory was quite small (less than 1MB), I
also put a "break" before "case ZONE_DMA" in the
build_zonelists_node() functions to avoid the allocation fallback.
