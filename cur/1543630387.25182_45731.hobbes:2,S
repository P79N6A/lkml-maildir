I'll let Christoph speak for himself, but my point is that
get_block() is an interface exported from the filesystem.  It should
be possible to specify any logical block number that the filesystem
supports.   That the current VM system on 32-bit machines will never
request a block beyond 2^32 is a (one-day-soon-to-be-removed) current
limitation.
