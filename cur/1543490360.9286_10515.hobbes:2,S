If the "derogatory comments" (which I haven't seen myself) are accurate, I
as a user of glibc really don't care whether the FSF has warm fuzzies or
not.
If the FSF (as an entity) cares, they'll release a version of glibc which
compiles with GCC 2.8.1, or submit patches to the crew working on glibc if
they feel they'll integrate well. For better or worse, -THEY- created the
GPL. They've got very little room to complain; their own dearly held
philosophy (which I generally share) has been used against them, as it was
meant to be used against slow, closed development models.
Their best remedy? Recognize that, in the eyes of many people (including
some rather influential distributions), 2.8.1 is a no-show because of the
length of time it took to get out of the gates and how slow and closed
development seems to the average user.
Then, recognize that the same has already basically happened to glibc
development, and that if they don't like it, they need to step up to the
plate and do the work they claim is needed, instead of "not being happy
about it".
