There were corrections to logic errors in the vm scanner which will cause
increased pageout.

swapoff/swapon doesn't do what you think it does.  The pages are read from
the swap device, have the ptes reattached but the pages are placed on the
inactive list, from where they will be swapped out again very easily after
a swapon.
Which is really the correct behaviour: if these pages were earlier swapped
out then clearly they are the right ones to swap out when swap again
becomes available.
But that doesn't seem very important, and the old swapoff/swapon trick is
useful, so...
