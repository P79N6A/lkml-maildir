Also, I'm not sure if this is still the case but in earlier versions of the 
O(1) scheduler, nice(19) tasks tended to get their entire timeslice in one 
big long uninterrupted gulp.  (By the time they got a slice, everything with 
a higher priority has already run.)  This was great for long cpu-intensive 
loads because it meant your cache stayed hot, so you wound up churning 
through your CPU-bound load even faster than if you got little snippets of 
time and had to keep reloading your cache.  (Great for interactive latency, 
sucks for number crunching.)
Higher priority tasks get first crack at the CPU,  but that doesn't mean they 
get to keep it for long.  High priority is for latency reasons, not for 
throughput reasons.  If your router spills over to ksoftirqd, you're already 
beyond optimizing for latency.  If ksoftirqd is doing ping-pong scheduling 
with cron, overall throughput is worse.
