All i'm asking for is to make the self-test easily accessible. Not for 
it to blow up in the face of users who do not ask for it.
And, at least to me, there seems to be a rather apparent correlation 
between "suspend/resume regressions caught as early as possible" and the 
future, desired state of: "STR working sanely on x86" ;-)
You really seem to treat S2R suckiness as a fact of life, but it isnt. 
Yes, it's a hard field for a number of reasons, but we could be doing _a 
lot_ better. One of them would be this "notice s2r breakage when i 
create or add the patch that breaks it" angle.
