Oh, for crying out loud!  Had you ever looked at that "API"?
At least 90% of it are random functions exposing random details of internals.
Most of them are there only because some in-tree piece of code had been
"modularized".  Badly.
Due to the dumb mechanism used to export symbols, each of those layering
violations automatically becomes available to all modules.  And they outnumber
the things that could be reasonably considered as something resembling an
API.  Outnumber by order of magnitude.
The problem had been festering for almost a decade now, and external modules
also didn't help things - a lot of them contained layering violations of their
own and asked to export this, this and that.  With no explanation offered and
too little resistance met.
In 2.7 we need to get the export list back to sanity.  Right now it's a such
a junkpile that speaking about even a relative stability for it...  Not funny.
