Thanks, I will add this PCI ID to ahci.c.

Two answers:
a) For the upstream kernel -- when the drivers are built into the kernel
-- the order in which the drivers are listed in drivers/scsi/Makefile
affects the probe order (priority).  When the drivers are built as
kernel modules, the contents of /etc/modprobe.conf (or /etc/modules.conf
for kernel 2.4.x) determines which driver to load.
b) For distributors (Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake, etc.), the installer
engineers at each company choose which driver to load.
To simplify matters, it is recommended to avoid situations where
multiple drivers have the same PCI ID listed.  The "more advanced"
driver (AHCI) is preferred of course ;-)
