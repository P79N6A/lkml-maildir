For the above it make no difference if there's a write buffer or not.
Just replace the A = 1 and B = 0 with a `make A visible to other CPUs' and
`make B visible to other CPUs' and move the two writes some hour before.
Speculation is a completly different issue.
Feel free to ask further if I am not been clear enough.
