I ignored nothing.  I fully accepted your explanation as true and 
pointed out that it changes nothing; data loss in this perfectly valid 
use case just because the kernel can not be absolutely certain the user 
did not do something stupid while suspended is unacceptable.

How it behaves while running and how it behaves while suspended are 
usually two very different things.

No, I took your word for it without protest as it doesn't change my main 
argument: data loss in the face of normal usage is not acceptable. 
Claiming that it has to be this way because the alternative _might_ 
result in data loss in the worst (mis)use case is an untenable position.
