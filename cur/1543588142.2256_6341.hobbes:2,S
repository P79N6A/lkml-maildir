Ok, the issue here is that we're trying to get a release out and so anything
that majorly changes the code is getting shunted aside for the moment.  It
would be stupid to just add everything that comes in on the ML without
review.  Linus does the exact same thing.  I've said this before to you
Andreas, but apparently you feel that you should have final say on whether
your patches go in or not.
As far as getting patches into the stock kernel, we've been sending patches
to Linus for over a month now, and none of them have made it in.  Maybe
someone has some pointers on how we get our code past his filters.
