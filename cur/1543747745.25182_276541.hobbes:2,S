Subject: [PATCH] UML - Fix setting of TIF_SIGPENDING

My older patch, that sets TIF_SIGPENDING after an ptrace-interception
in syscall_trace() is wrong.
Some syscalls want to be called without any signal pending. If a signal
is pending on syscall-entry, they immediately return with -ERESTARTNOINTR.
Thus, on return to user, the pending signals can be processed and the
kernel will lower eip by 2 to have the syscall restarted after that.
Since my change sets TIF_SIGPENDING on the entry and exit interception,
stracing such a syscall looped! Try "strace ls" to see what happens.
Fix: set TIF_SIGPENDING on the exit interception only. This avoids the
loop and is enough for security.
