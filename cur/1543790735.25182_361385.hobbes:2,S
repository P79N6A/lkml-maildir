However there's usually little overlap between the subsystems trees - with
a net update, a USB update, a SCSI update and an ia64 update it's usually
pretty obvious which one caused a particular regression.
And given that the size of each individual subsystem update is unaltered,
it doesn't really matter whether or not they all came on the same day.
The individual -mm-only patches tend to be more scattered around the tree,
which is why I send them as batches of 100-200 every couple of days: to get
a bit of separation in the -git snapshots.  This hasn't actually proven to
be very useful, though.
