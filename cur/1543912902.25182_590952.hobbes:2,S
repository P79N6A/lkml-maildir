Subject: [PATCH][Trivial] CIFS: Use ssleep() instead of msleep() when sleeping multiple seconds

Hi,
A little trivial thing...
When sleeping for multiple seconds the function to use is
ssleep() not msleep() - especially when there's a comment 
above reading "... wait at least 45 seconds ...", then 
ssleep() best describes what is wanted.
