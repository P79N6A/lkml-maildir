Hello
It's nice to come back to this list.
I use 2.0.36 kernel on my pentium box.
I set Apache 1.3.4 for http proxy and used that for myself.
But, it didn't work as I expected.  If I connect to a page that includes
several objects, the load average will go up to the range of 10-15.
So I decided to try "Squid" and this time faced another problem.
While I configure to compile squid-2.1, it complained
about the limit of maximum open files.
I'm not familiar with the kernel internals.  But, after brief inspection,
I got feeling that NR_OPEN, NR_FILE, and OPEN_MAX are the values.
Pls, explain me about the roll of those values, one by one.
And also tell me if I missed something.
Thanks,
Vajra Yoo
