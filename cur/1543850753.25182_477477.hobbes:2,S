hai ,
I am thinking of giving support to mmap of a file that is partially in
page cache using hugetlbfs.What i am thinking is that whenever a file
is too big(in the range of Gigabytes), we can use huge pages and free
the the page frames that have been used by this file so that other
small files may use them.
Using hugepages will reduce TLB misses and hence enhance system
throughput. This will also give other processes to use the page frames
that were used by the file which has been copied into hugepages.Is
there any support for this in linux 2.6 kernel till date?What are the
problems that i may face? Has anyone got any solution for this
problem?
Sincerely,
Prashant Anand
