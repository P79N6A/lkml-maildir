Am I wrong if I affirm that changing the prototypes into:
unsigned long ioremap(unsigned long base, long length);
void iounmap(unsigned long);
we would solve (well, not solve, simply we'd show it ;-) a lot of
porting issue?
The value returned from ioremap *is not* something usable with
dereference operator.
