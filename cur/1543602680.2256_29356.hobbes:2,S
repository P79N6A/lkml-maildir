No, you don't want to do that. This is swsusp package, meant to
replace suspend-to-disk on your notebook. If you choose random
notebook, it will allow you to suspend to disk, but not to suspend,
boot X, poweron, boot Y, reboot, boot X.
If you do what you described, you'll corrupt your filesystem. It is
designed that way.
