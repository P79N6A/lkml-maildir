There is a new version of the driver (0.07) on my web site.  It has this 
issue and one other issue fixed (hopefully).  The other issue is when 
using artsd with the 0.06 driver, I had a report that artsd would end up 
waiting on select forever and never getting woken up.  The 0.07 driver 
changes wait queue and lvi handling in a few strategic places, so it 
should work.  However, it's untested.  Reports welcome.
