To answer one of my own questions: my current LILO version does support
speeds up to 38400bps. I didn't try it before because the _man page_ said
it supported up to 9600 (and I believed in it :), but after checking
LILO's Changelog, I found that support for speeds up to 38400 is available
for a long time now. I tested it running at 38400 and it works.
Since I still want to add support for speeds up to 115200, the other two
questions are still up (see below):

I'd really appreciate any help.
