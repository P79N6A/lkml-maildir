the ratio between the number of syscalls vs. the number of context 
switches is 1-2 orders of magnitude. So a loss of 9 cycles in the 
syscall path is roughly equal to a loss of 90-900 cycles in switch_to() 
costs ...
the TLS ABI is just a gcc stupidity. Why did they pick the _second_ 
extra selector, instead of the first one ...? Anyway, perhaps this could 
be solved by extending gcc with a switch to also generate __thread code 
off %fs. Probably not worth the pain though ...
