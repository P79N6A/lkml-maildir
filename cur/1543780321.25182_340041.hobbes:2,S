I don't think you can forcibly reclaim MAP_NORESERVE objects (I'm
assuming you mean completely throwing away dirty pages).
MAP_NORESERVE isn't standardized, so all we can go by is what everybody
else does (and what makes the most sense).
Based on the Linux and Solaris man pages (none of FreeBSD, Irix, HP-UX,
or AIX implement anything similar), I think calls to mmap() with
MAP_NORESERVE should always succeed (regardless of memory conditions,
not other errors) and individual writes to unallocated pages in a
MAP_NORESERVE region should either allocate a new page if possible or
send a SIGSEGV without triggering the OOM killer.
