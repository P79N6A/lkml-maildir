The odds of even 128,000 working on a small machine except close to boot
are low too.

I guessed you may be, thats why I pointed you at vmalloc. vmalloc memory
isnt physically linear but is logically linear (that is DMA can see the
different but the kernel cant). If you use vmalloc/vfree instead of
kmalloc/kfree your 128000 will work fine andn reliably
