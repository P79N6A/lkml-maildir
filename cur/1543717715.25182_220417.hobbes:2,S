Yes, this works to stop it from complaining (on 6Y120P0). It comes up 
with write cache enabled, and hdparm -W0/-W1 work to disable/enable 
write cache as evidenced by the tiobench results. Not as evidenced by 
/proc/ide/hda/settings (drive->wcache) which is always 1 and which will 
probably confuse more users than just me -- I believe I saw hdparm just 
pushes a drive command through an ioctl?
Question though:

write_cache() also sets drive->wcache (to the argument, 1 in this case) 
and you call that unconditionally, so the "if (foo) drive->wcache = 1" 
seems superfluous. If the idea indeed is to unconditionally enable write 
cache, it seems just
write_cache(drive, 1);
would be equivalent. Or if that wasn't the intention, maybe:
if (foo)
	write_cache(drive, 1);
or if it should in fact be disabled if (!foo):
write_cache(drive, (id->csfo & 1) || (id->cfs_enable_1 & (1 << 5)));
or ...
Ignore me if I completely missed the point, just looks odd.
Rene.
