I only learned about this by reading the docs on Savannah; the admins can
provide better information.  But my understanding is simply that they have
M users and N projects, and they want the system to support any number of
permission pairs from M x N, i.e. they want each user to be able to commit
to an arbitrary number of projects.  And CVS relies on OS permissions.

I guess they prefer to use traditional Unix permissions rather than ACLs.
I have the same preference.  Unix groups are well supported by tools and
the kind of permission setup I described above is nicely transparent
to administer.  Granting a user write access to a project is simply
'adduser username projectname', and a project can easily support a large
number of writers without big ACLs.
The issue is not just lock directories, but the right to change any
file in a project, i.e. full CVS commit access to the project rather
than anonymous access.  So they would need an ACL on each file in the
repository, and they would need new files to inherit ACLs from their
parent directories (I've never used ACLs on Linux but I assume this kind
of thing is supported).
