It certainly seems so. The PIV seems to be very touchy about code 
patterns and the kind of jobs its fed. Gcc at the moment doesn't have PIV
optimisations either. The Athlon by contrast is extremely good at handling
code compiled for any CPU variant and that meant Athlon didnt need much
if any work for performance

Thats fine - your chipset is newer than the AGP code knows.
