In that all the following tools (and possibly files) which are
returned by `rpm ql procps` replace the util-linux counterparts, if
any. Note that rpm -ql might return less programs than actually
present in procps, since distributors need to choose which program to
pick from what {util-linux or procps}.

+ the stuff in /usr/share/doc and /usr/share/man
with the idea that you retain maintership over these. So my proposal/idea was
just one of how to package it.
