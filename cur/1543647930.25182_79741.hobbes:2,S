I spent some time trying to track this problem down, but reached a wall
due to the size and nature of the ChangeSet.
The bitkeeper ChangeSet that made Evolution's address book hang when
trying to compose a new message when run on 2.5.x kernels was 1.262.2.2.
According to my notes from June, that ChangeSet comprised modifications
to 116 files, splitting the socket structure from the protocol.  Up to
that ChangeSet, the problem does not exist.  After applying that
ChangeSet, the problem is manifest.
Sorry I couldn't dig deeper...and I hope this helps someone.
