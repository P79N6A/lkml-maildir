This is a reasonable rule for future interfaces, but won't
help us here on this one.
For one thing, users can be making use of the inner types
to build the blobs they send via these interfaces.  So it's
not like we can rename "struct iphdr" to "struct kernel_iphdr"
to fix this particular case.
Really, we page a huge price these days because the relationship
between glibc's and the kernel's userland header exports in the
past has been anti-social at best.
