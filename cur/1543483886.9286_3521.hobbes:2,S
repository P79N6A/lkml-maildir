I promised and promise again, if someone will explain why
he needs subnet proxy arp, it will be ready the next evening.
echo 1 > /proc/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/proxy_arp. It is enough.
What's about different outputs of "arp -a":
ceratinly, it is deal of taste, but to my not-very-well breed taste,
2.1 gives much nicer and intelligible output. 8)8)
