Yes that is why we need to add them to the count of total pages.

The dirty ratio with the ZVCS would be
NR_DIRTY + NR_UNSTABLE_NFS
	/ 
NR_FREE_PAGES + NR_INACTIVE + NR_ACTIVE + NR_MLOCK
I think we need a PageMlocked after all for the delayed NR_MLOCK 
approach but it needs to have different semantics in order to make
it work. With the patch that I posted earlier we could actually return
a page to the LRU in zap_pte_range while something else is keeping
a page off the LRU (i.e. Page migration is occurring and suddenly the 
page is reclaimed since zap_pte_range put it back). So PageMlocked needs 
to be set in shrink_list() in order to clarify that the page was taken 
off the LRU lists due to it being mlocked and not for other reasons. 
zap_pte_range then needs to check for PageMlocked before putting the 
page onto the LRU.
If we do that then we can observer the state transitions and have an 
accurate count. The delayed accounting problem can probably be 
somewhat remedied by putting new mlocked pages not on the LRU and 
counting them directly. Page migration can simply clear the PageMlocked 
bit and then treat the page as if it was taken off the LRU.
