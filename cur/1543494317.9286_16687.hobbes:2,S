   Ie. on loading of a binary could quickly scan it for illegal
   sequences and overwrite with NOPs, then execute it. Of course, this
   doesn't cater for things that does J-I-T compilation & execution
   though.
You roughly have described how we hope to work around it.
IRIX does something very similar to work around cpu lockup
bugs on early MIPS r4k parts.
