Hey thanks for looking. It can be quite hard for people to find time to review 
patches and I appreciate the effort.

Indeed it would. I was hoping the time frame for inclusion of swap prefetching 
would be much shorter than clock pro given the relatively intrusive nature of 
clock pro. It would make sense to update the accounting to that of clock pro 
if/when clock pro was pushed. One of the features of the current accounting 
is it is extremely cheap and slightly sloppy on purpose since there is no 
point to being perfectly accurate and incur the extra overhead. Once that 
overhead is considered worthwhile for clock pro algorithms we can just use 
that data.

Nope you're definitely not missing something. As you're well aware code ends 
up often being far from the original attempt. It's the legacy of the code 
evolution and it was something I would hopefully have thought about myself 
without being prompted by someone else. I'll have to get onto that with the 
next version.
Just as a data point there is still a workload that is inappopriately causing 
out-of-memory conditions when it shouldn't and only once I nail all known 
issues from the -ck users will I push it to -mm.
Thanks again
Cheers,
Con
