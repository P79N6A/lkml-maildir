Oh, this? It's like doing syscall for every write to "/dev/null".

At least this will not crash, if you don't have some variable set.
Efficiency there is lesser number of variables(-2 vs +2), that are copied
for every make job, and are textually parsed and searched.

Right. Seems like you are talking about "[quite_]cmd_*", which are
commands. Here you've invented such rules for ordinary utility in
`filechk`. And by try they've failed due to mixing functionality
dependency on having arbitrary variable being set.
Shell syntax tried to avoid this, but `make` syntax and ``convention''
did a boom. Boom, where hacker's V=1 mode failed itself and failed to
give a clue about problem (at least, when i saw Sam's message in
linux-kbuild). Yea, `make` is not needed.
