If you want help with correctness here, you'll have to do a bit more
explaining and abstraction.
In general nobody would try and prove things about unstructured C and
assembler! - we need to know the exact semantics of the machine code for
starters if you do that, and that's never been done.

Not sure what you mean by recursive here. A semaphore is a semaphore is a
semaphore. I.e. on read it does
     block until resource count > 0, then decrement resource count and return.
On write it does
     increment resource count and return.

grab grab release release? That only works if the semaphore guarded two
resources. Can you be meaning release release grab grab instead? Which?

For C and assembler in the context of a dual ix86? :-)

The semaphore belongs to someone or some process id. OK.  The count is the
available resource count, I suppose. What's "waking"?

Well, that was a 1 resource or 0 resource init, respectively.  I doubt
that's atomic. Does it matter?

Uh ..  the owner is a task.  Do you care?  Ahhh ..  I think you are
trying to make the semaphore only unlockable by the task that locked it.

What?? Beg 'pardon. This may be the way of wheedling its owner task
out of the semaphore? Probably.

Oh great.  I guess that means it's a subroutine that doesn't really
shift the stack frame.  Useful to know.  It must want everything it
needs setup in registers beforehand.  It still saves the return address
on the stack, though?  So the stack pointer does shift by 4.

Some variant? I need to know what that does. What is a spinlock anyway?
I'd have guessed at some sort of loop that does a yield and lowers the
priority of the current thread, but that's just grasping (at threads).

Uh, pass. What IS waking supposed to represent? What does this whole
function want to do? It's not wait nor signal nor init, and since those
are the only specified functionalities of a semaphore, I need info.
This function seems to set the owner field - I'll assume the spinlock is for
atomicity. Doesn't it need to be lifted afterwards?
Anway, it decrements waiting. If that were the priority indicator that
the spinlock were looking at (and the spinlock does what I imagine
in terms of yielding), this might make some sense. Spec needed.

I don't read assembler. Need spec. I see a decrement and a jump?

Mmm.  Not enough info.  I need a list of the code, with assertions made
about it every so often and intespersed between the lines.  Just the
overall spec would be nice.  I can interpolate from there.
