Reclaiming is very easy when the workload is just page cache,
because the application will be throttled when too many page
cache pages are dirty.
When using mmap or memory hogs writing to swap, applications
will not be throttled by the "too many dirty pages" logic,
but may instead end up being throttled in the direct reclaim
path instead.
At that point direct reclaim may become a lot more common,
making the imbalance more significant.
I'll run a few tests.

So far the performance numbers you have measured are very
encouraging and do indeed suggest that the priority==DEF_PRIORITY
thing does not make a difference.
