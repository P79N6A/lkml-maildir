Its also a lot easier to update them once the core stops changing! There
are some things I worry about - the bio splitting has to be resolved,
IDE raid can't happen until that occurs and I'm also waiting for the IDE
taskfile stuff/bio splitting bits to resolve so I can merge a load of
IDE updates to make things like SII IDE and newer HPT chips work in
2.5.x/2.6
Architectures are also normally just a sync up job and its again easier
to do once the core has stoppee changing.
