Yesterday, I downloaded and installed kernel 2.3.35, compiled and installed,
and I noticed that there are a lot of errors coming up in my log like
Dec 31 09:24:07 beastor kernel: TCPv4 bad checksum from 209.207.224.40:0050 to 207.181.77.136:068b, len=1480/1500 
Dec 31 09:24:22 beastor last message repeated 2 times
They don't seem to affect performance.  Are these errors normal?  Is this
an indicator of something wrong?
