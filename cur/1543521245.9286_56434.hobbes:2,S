depends on the maximum size the hardware supports. Defining anything longer
isn't standard. long long may be 64 bits (on a 32 bit system), but not 128
which it just might be where the size of long is 64 bits..
This causes portability problems when you can't depend on the size of
a int/long/whatever. I've had this problem before when porting perl. The
network socket calls all assumed an int was 32 bits. The original perl
4.xxx wouldn't work on a cray (at least, not the socket stuff, everything
else did work).
My reference was off.. I've still got an earlier edition and didn't
know they changed that. I had seen the construct, just didn't know it
was now standard.
