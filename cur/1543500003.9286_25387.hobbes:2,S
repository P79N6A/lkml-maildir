as I'ev written before, for me it's all SCSI:  NCR815 with Quantum Atlas 1
and IBM 0664M1H (plus Toshiba CDROM and HP DAT).  this SCSI bus (including
cable and 2*active terminators) worked flawlessly for years, only recently
I've replaced NCR810 on my old main board (ASUS SP3G) with NCR815 card.
also please note (more recent mail) that my kernel compilation crashes
(which only showed up for 2.2.10, not 22.5 before) disappeared completely 
when lowering CPU clock from 450 to 400 MHz.
