Well the point is that the 2.5.25 is well behind whats
going on. It still contains IDE 93, which *is* broken.
Please hunt for IDE 94 + 95 + 96 [without 97]. This should
help. Anyway. My plan is to provide a 98 soon which will
be cummulative against 2.5.25, just to geive people a chance
to work on it again. But as it stands - *plain* 2.5.25 is
indeed very dangerous in this regard.
