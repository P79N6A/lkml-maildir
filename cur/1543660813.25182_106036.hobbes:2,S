Hmm, actually the mapnr's as physical pfn's are broken with
MAP_NR_DENSE(), though existing boxen probably luck out. The RNG uses
an integer multiply which may be slow on various cpus, and I wouldn't
mind either a stronger or better documented RNG algorithm. ->color_init
is basically a bitflag, and ->target_color has a very limited range.
sizeof(task_t) needs to be small, could you fold that stuff into
->flags or ->thread_info?
