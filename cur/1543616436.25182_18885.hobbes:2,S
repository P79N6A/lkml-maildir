Hello,everyone,does anyone be familiar with the loop
device? I just read some source code of loop.c file. I
have some questions about this loop device. I am a new
one to this loop device. Thanks in advance.
I want to implement my own loop device which is used
to encrypt the whole disk,say /dev/fd0, even including
the boot sector on the floppy disk. How can I make a
connection between my own loop device with the floppy
disk? I mean how I can connect the loop device with
the floppy disk to hook the READ/WRITE operations to
the floppy disk.
Michael
