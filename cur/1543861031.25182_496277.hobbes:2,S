Nobody is working on it (at least to my knowledge), and to me it is 
feature - it always worked this way, like smbfs did back in the past - 
if you send signal 9 to process using mount point, and there is some 
transaction in progress, nobody can correctly finish that transaction 
anymore.  Fixing it would require non-trivial amount of code, and given 
that NCP itself is more or less dead protocol I do not feel that it is 
necessary.
If you want to fix it, feel free.  Culprit is RQ_INPROGRESS handling in 
ncp_abort_request - it just aborts whole connection so it does not have 
to provide temporary buffers and special handling for reply - as buffers 
currently specified as reply buffers are owned by caller, so after 
aborting request you cannot use them anymore.
