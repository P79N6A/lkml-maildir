How about this:
The kernel tracks CPU usage, time slice expiration, and numerous other 
statistics, and exports them to userspace through /proc or somesuch. 
Then a user-space daemon adjusts priority.  This could work, but it 
would be sluggish in adjusting priorities.
I still like Nick and Con's solutions better.
