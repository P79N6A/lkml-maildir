If BHs run for whole tick, they deserved to be lost and the problem
is not a problem.
The case is when timer marked during _NET_BH_ is active, that is
the case which should be handled correclty. Different people
blamed on this for long time, it results in massive loses
on serial links.
BTW in softnet TIMER_BH is not softirq (I am waiting for per-cpu timers 8)8)
Hint, hint!), so that scheduleing TIMER_BH is the same as in current 2.3.
I meaned scheduling of genuine softirqs.
