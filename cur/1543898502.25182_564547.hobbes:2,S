Looks relatively sane at first glance; busy this week so haven't looked
very hard yet. Two thing though... you're mixing proper C types
(uint32_t) and the Linux-specific legacy crap types (__u32). Pick one. I
won't recommend _which_ one, because if I do I'll make Andrew unhappy.
But pick one; don't use both at the same time.
Also read Documentation/volatile-considered-harmful.txt and ponder
deeply your use of 'volatile' on certain members of struct pps_s.
