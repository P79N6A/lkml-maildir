Folks, if you want to be on bleeding edge with Mandrake you really
have to read cooker :))
I have put a set of support SRPMs for Mandrake 9.1 on
http://supermount-ng.sf.net/mdk-25/
They currently include initscripts, mkinitrd, module-init-tools and
modultils. I had devfsd and gkrellm as well but now they are
incorporated into mainstream, just fetch them from cooker.
Using these packages I freely switch between 2.4 and 2.6 on the same
Mandrake 9.1 based box. Actually the reason I made them was exactly
this - I needed abililty to work normally on supermount for 2.6 :)
They are fully modules-enabled, actually my config is basically
Mandrake default with obvious 2.6 modifications (I made it more and
more modular with the time), initrd, devfs etc are supported.
module-init-tools will try to build modprobe.conf from your modules.conf and include suitable /etc/modprobe.devfs; also I have
packaged default module aliases.
I really need feedback with them - they work for me but other people
had issues with module autoloading.
I will update them every now and then for new Mandrake packages.
regards
