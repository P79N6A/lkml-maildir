Well even if it fixed it, it could not work in most applications.
Here is a typical application (like inetd).
	parent { Command line has whatever }
        fd = accept();
        switch(fork())
        {
        case 0: // Child
             getpeername();
             ***** Put client IP-Address on command line *****
             do_stuff();
             exit();
        case -1: //bad
        default:
               //parent Command line not changed
        }
   So, the forked children from the server all have the client's IP
   address so `ps` shows who is connected. This technique has worked
   for years. Now, I don't know if you are "supposed" to do this
   kind of thing, but that's how it's been done, and now it's broken.
Cheers,
