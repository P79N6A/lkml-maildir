It works fine here on a Mitac laptop (the one that needed a Win98
warm-boot a few weeks ago), but it is quite noisy about IRQs that are also
used for other devices. (PCI: The same IRQ used for device 00:08.0)
The way I see it, 2.4.0-test12-pre6 is just a much longer name for 2.4.0.  
Keep going like this and we may end up calling you Linus "Santa" Torvalds!  
It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?  :-)  Or should that be *-<:-)
