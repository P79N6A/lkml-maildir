I think it is, Jeff.  Try this patch:

With egcs-2.91.66 I get this:
this name: eth%d
next name: eth%d
this name: eth0
next name: eth0
I.e. the string literals in Space.c that look like "eth%d" are all in the
same place.  Replacing 'strcpy(dev->name, buf)' with 'dev->name = strdup
(buf)' obviously gives the correct output:
this name: eth%d
next name: eth%d
this name: eth0
next name: eth%d
The next thing to fix is actually putting the command-line ether=
parameters _somewhere_.  My plan for that is to assume that the user is
correct, and then to just count from the first '...%d' that we find in
dev_base.  Does that sound right?
Tim.
