It just happens every time on HP iPaq hx4700. hx4700 have internal CF
slot, which is working via pxa2xx pcmcia driver.
Have you tried it recently or about six months ago? Because at that time
it was working for me too, but some kernel change
(I suppose semaphores->completion conversion) unearthed that bug, but I'm
not sure.

No HAL used. No udev used. Bare kernel + static /dev + shell. CF is not
even mounted once.
Have you read comments inside -fix patch? Imho it's obvious that nobody
putting driverfs_device second time, but got it twice.
