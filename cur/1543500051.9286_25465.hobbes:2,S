now that many people have found the same problems as I initially (?)
mentioned, I'd say that the most of it probaly is triggered by some problem
in 2.2.9 and 2.2.10.
So far I have been running 2.2.7 witgh a lot of disk activity for approx 24
hrs without any problems; it would probably be a good guess that it's
something critical in the 2.2.9/10 kernels that trigger the corruption.
what do the guru's say of it ?
