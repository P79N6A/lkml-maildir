Hi there,
Same here but different. ;-) I am on 2.2.12 kernel here with ppp 2.3.9.
ppp with 2.2.12 is fine without *any* problems.
But ppp with 2.3.20, I am unable to browse any http sites. 
I am able to use ftp, smtp and pop also works. Haven't tested anything else
i am able to check my mail and all. My only problem is that I just can't browse
any http_site. ;-(
lynx says HTTP/Ok Awaiting Response........
and Netscape says Host Contacted. Waiting for reply......
Both get stuck there. ;^(
Anybody who can help em here . ;-(
Regards
	Avenger
