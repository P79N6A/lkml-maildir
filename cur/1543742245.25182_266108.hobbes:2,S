yes. I'd suggest to start with the simplest setup - i.e. just one
fluidsynth instance running. I suspect 3-4 instances later on will be
enough to trigger some xruns or at least some of the bigger delays.
you possibly wont be able to debug the 'production' setup, but that's
not an issue because the latencies should show up under just 2-3
instances running as well.

ugh. Possibly some sort of interaction with the firmware and/or an
outright driver bug?
