Your response took look enough for me to switch to another job.  I
haven't yet returned to dealing with this.

I am emulating what has come before.  All of my examples look like
what I did.

Where's the model?

Huh?
aThe solution isn't really that complex.  I need two things.  First, I
must override the register-level access routines in order to do a
little hardware workaround cha-cha-cha.  There's nothing I can do to
fix the hardware.  Second, I need to be able to poll the interface
after initiating a command.  IIRC, you said that I missed at least one
place where this needed to be done.
There are also some very important code (hacks) in
  arch/arm/mach-lh7a40x/ide-lpd7a40x.c
to deal with the fact that I didn't want to touch the SELECT_DRIVE
call from the IDE driver.  The problem was that the SELECT_DRIVE call
in ide-iops.c does this:
  void SELECT_DRIVE (ide_drive_t *drive)
  {
	  if (HWIF(drive)->selectproc)
		  HWIF(drive)->selectproc(drive);
	  HWIF(drive)->OUTB(drive->select.all, IDE_SELECT_REG);
  }
instead of this:
  void SELECT_DRIVE (ide_drive_t *drive)
  {
	  if (HWIF(drive)->selectproc)
		  HWIF(drive)->selectproc(drive);
	  else
		  HWIF(drive)->OUTB(drive->select.all, IDE_SELECT_REG);
  }
The OUTB breaks my interface because I don't really have byte-level
access to the resgisters.  So, is selectproc a pre-select procedure or
should it be a substitute?
Anyway, that is what I did in a nutshell.  I plan to get back to this
in a week or so.  Since Russell King already integrated the lh7a40x
code into the kernel, this stuff should be easy to test.
Cheers.
