The source for the man pages is included and the viewable versions 
are on Davide's web site here:
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_create.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_ctl.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_wait.txt
They describe how to use epoll, under what circumstances it will be
best used or not to use it and other man page tidbits. Also note
there is an updated version of sys_epoll with the latest input received
from the mailing lists. That is attached as well (for easy merging) ;)
Bert and Davide did all the work. I just did a little cleanup. 
Please include the man pages if^H^Hwhen you take the patches.
Thanks.
Hanna
