Similar experience here - the network connectivity
would go away, but the machine was still alive.
Using the e100 driver instead seemed to solve the
problem on the dell servers here.
But I didn't have to reboot - just stopped networking,
unloaded the eepro100 drivers, loaded the e100
drivers and started networking.
