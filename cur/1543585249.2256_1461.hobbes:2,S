Hi,
	I am extremely sorry to bother this group with this message. But I
am really unable to understand the following. So it would be very kind of
you if you clarify this.
	In 2.2.16, in the function alloc_skb(),
atomic_set(skb_datarefp(skb),1) is there. Now skb_datarefp() returns 
skb->end casted in (atomic_t *) type. And atomic_set here setting it to
1.
But before atomic_set() is called in alloc_skb(), skb->end is set to
data+size. Now my question is what is the purpose of calling atomic_set()?
regards
sourav
