This is getting off topic, but it's good to spread the info around:

If you have to share a machine with a Microsoft OS, the best thing is to
install the Microsoft OS first.  That way it can set up the partition tables
however it likes.  Just leave enough hard drive space free.  
Then install Linux.  This has several advantages - you can more easily set
up Grub or Lilo to dual boot, and Linux can deal with whatever Microsoft's
partition table flavor of the year is.  The Microsoft OS is less likely to
become confused and violently lash out using that approach :-) 
Another note: If dual-booting Windows 2000, upgrade to service pack 1 before
installing Linux.  I was able to blue-screen W2K before SP1 by starting
their disk management tool on a disk with dozens of Linux partitions.  And I
agree - I am thankful that I will never have to deal with this again either.
