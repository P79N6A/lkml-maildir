I am not sure I am fully convinced one way or the other, but treating
every bit of code as we find it scares me.  The fact is, if a
spin_unlock() can magically reenable interrupts that is a bug.
I don't like relying on chance and the possibility your debug tool found
the problem... but at the same time, Ingo's solution is a lot cleaner.
Linus, Ingo, comments?
Attached is the patch George mentioned, against 2.5.27.
