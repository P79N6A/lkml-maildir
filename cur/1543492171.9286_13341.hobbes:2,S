Does it seem reasonable to change the test to check against PF_PTRACED,
and have the slow path then check for PF_TRACESYS, or any other 
necessary flag(s) both before and after the system call itself? This
would only slow down ptraced programs, and then only by a small amount.

Unfortunately, for my purposes, this is far too slow.  Two traps per
system call would kill any performance my program has.  I'd be happy to 
find a user space solution to this which didn't require PF_TRACESYS to
be on for the entire execution of the program, though.
