I think we really need them by default. I had seven bugs with touchpads,
lost synchronization with PS/2 mice and similar fixed just by enabling
this patch unconditionally in the SuSE tree.
As far as I know, there are only a few nForce boards where enabling the
patch hurts - we should be able to do a DMI exception for those. Anyway,
those boards have bigger problems, as USB reportedly doesn't work there
(because the USB drivers do the same handoff).
