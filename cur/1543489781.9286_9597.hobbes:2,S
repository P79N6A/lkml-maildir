Given that HP has at least announced plans for Linux on their boxes, if there
is code in Linux that cares about the stack growth (other than the usual kernal
machine dependent files and compiler varargs support), it probably soon will be
identified (PA-Riscs have stacks that go in the opposite direction to most
machines these days).  10 years ago this was a big problem due to the fact that
varargs/stdarg wasn't established practice, and 'real men' wrote their own
variable argument handling (I had been worked on the Data General MV/Eclipse C
compiler for a couple of years, and it was another machine with the stack going
the oppisite direction).
Note, having the stack grow in the oppisite direction, means that you can't
have the stack and the heap grow towards each other.  Instead one or both areas
must be fixed in size.
