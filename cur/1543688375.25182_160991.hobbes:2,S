No, really. The sense of tasklet_kill() is that tasklet is under complete
control of caller upon exit from it. This clear_bit just makes some (only
marginally useful) reinitialization for the case the user will want
to reuse the struct. Essentially, after tasklet_unlock_wait() you can do
everything with the struct, it is not an alive object anymore.

I would not say it is easy. When tasklet is enqueued on another cpu you
have no way to stop it unless you are in process context, where you can
sit and wait for completion.
