Hi all,
here the results of a simple dbench test.
The "core" of script is the following:
for value in 2 8 16 24 32;
do 
	log=${kern}$1.dbench${value}.$date.log
	echo $log
		> ./log/$log
		for i in `seq 1 1 3`;
		do 
			echo $i ":" $value
			sync;
			sync;
			sync;
			./dbench $value |grep Th >> ./log/$log
		done;
	
	 awk '{tot+=$2}; END {print "Average: " tot/NR " MB/sec"}' ./log/$log >>./log/$log
The scripts evaluates the average of 3 runs of dbench N.
The missing part of the script is just "logging".
If someone is interested I can send or post to lkml the whole script.

Ok, dbench is not the best benchmark but, finally, 2.5.41 is faster then 2.4.19 (from the "dbench" point of view ;-)
