Not unusual - but so what.
This strategy may backfire if users find a way
to use the cheap box for something without Tivo's service contract.
That don't make me feel sorry for Tivo - they can then sell their
boxes with some profit - or go bankrupt for doing stupid business.
Similiar to how unrealistic cheap printers backed by ink sales
fail when third parties undercuts the ridiculously expensive ink.
Or give-away cellphones tied to an expensive provider, being
unlocked by third parties so a switch to a cheaper provider will work.
Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against Tivo - and nothing for
them either.  Them making a locked device is just a fun arms
race to see who can reprogram the bootloader key
or find some other clever way to load software. . .

Nothing against a hw manufacturers right - but of course they
have no particular right to succeed with give-away hw and
expensive service.  When that strategy fail due to people operating
the hw without buing service then the cure is to charge properly
for the hw, not to ask everybody to please stop hacking.
Assuming that nobody can change the box after the sale is
their risk, and there is nothing unfair about failure here.
