2.5 doesn't have releases, just snapshots of the development.

Remember we are talking about 2.4, not 2.5.  Having more time between
releases gives more time to test the pre releases.  The point it to have
good point (not like 2.4.11, 12, 14, or 15) releases for what is supposed to
be *stable*.
Release 50 -pre kernels for 2.4, but make sure that the next release has had a
chance to stabalize with the new changes.
