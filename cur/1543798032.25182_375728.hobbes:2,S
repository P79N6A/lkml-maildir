The original bug was filled against 2.6.12-9-amd64-k8 and then
reported to work with this patch with 2.6.14-something (probably,
because the exact kernel version is not mentioned in the bugzilla).
Were you able to reproduce the problem with 2.6.15-rc5?
BTW please use linux-ide@vger.kernel.org for ATA stuff
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
