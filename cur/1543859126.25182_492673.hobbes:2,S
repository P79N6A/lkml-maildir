Seems sensible.  I seem to recall considering doing it that way when I
initially implemeted flush_workqueue(), but I don't recall why I didn't do
this.  hmm.

Taking workqueue_mutex() unconditionally in flush_workqueue() means
that we'll deadlock if a single-threaded workqueue callback handler calls
flush_workqueue().
It's an idiotic thing to do, but I think I spotted a site last week which
does this.  scsi?  Not sure..
