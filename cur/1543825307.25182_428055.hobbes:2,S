Sorry by brain slipped I meant suspend/resume... not enough sleep too
much flamage..

But the things is today for many users suspend/resume to RAM works for
people running X drivers, I know on my laptop that my radeon
suspends/resumes fine when running vgacon/DRM/accelerated X, it
doesn't suspend/resume at all well when running vgacon on its own of
course. or with radeonfb for that matter. so I still believe the
suspend/resume code for a card can live in userspace if necessary but
it just shouldn't be part of X... it needs to be part of another
graphics controller process.

To be honest, not using fbdev may be a better long-term solutions I'm
wholly not convinced we can put enough support for things into the
fbdev drivers without a lot of work, I've concentrated before on
splitting X.org into two pieces, a device setup and control process
running most of the X driver, and a rendering server. The thing
currently missing from the equation is the memory management unit, so
I can say this buffer is the current front buffer, and things like
that, so that we can invalidate the front buffer on rotations and
other operations where it needs to be. This can all be built on top of
the DRM. We can then perhaps have an fbcon or drmcon that knows where
the card's frontbuffer is and what mode is set on it, so it can dump
oops etc...
vgacon causes problems of course with memory management, as I believe
that most graphics cards when in text mode, don't allow you to specify
what pieces of their VRAM are being used to display the text mode, so
you have to try and keep framebuffers at the start of RAM, when really
you'd like to not have that sort of restriction.
Dave.
