I seem to have found my problem.  There were two things involved:
1) virt_to_phys() doesn't work on user addresses, so you basically have to walk 
the page tables.  For ppc, iopa() seems to do this although there is a comment 
about it not working on pmac (which it seems to).
2) to setup the vma for unmapped areas I was using mmap with MAP_PRIVATE.  On 
the first write by userspace, the mapping was changed and the user page was no 
longer mapped to the desired kernel page.  Changing this to MAP_SHARED fixed it.
