Hello Marcelo,
it looks like -pre4 performs not well even in 4 GB environment. After few days
of running I find hanging 2.4.22 nfs-clients on a 2.4.23-pre4 server. 
On the client I get a bunch of those:
Sep 16 03:02:00 brenda kernel: nfs: server 192.168.1.1 OK

And then the nfs-action is dead. Process hangs. This has not happened with
2.4.22 as a server. It showed up after a day of creating 4,7 GB dvd iso images.
Creating theses isos was ok, no error or so during the action.
Is it possible that pre4 does not recover all that well from former memory
pressure?
> Have you tried 2.4.22-aa?
Sorry, not yet.
I will go back to 2.4.22 and stress it to see if these effects show up.

Stephan
