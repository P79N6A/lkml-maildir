Subject: [PATCH] ext2_fs.h should not be included
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I think the ext2_fs.h file is needlessly included in a few places in the
kernel source, causing me full-kernel recompiles whenever I change it
(I do it often enough for me to want to fix it).  It also appears to be
the source of a couple of copy-paste bugs in UFS and UDF.
* It is included in kernel/ksyms.c, yet ext2 does not export any symbols.
* It is included in include/linux/ext2_fs_sb.h (for no reason that I can see),
  which is itself included by include/fs.h, which is included by half of the
  kernel.  (Similarly, ext3_fs.h is in ext3_fs_sb.h - for Stephen to remove).
* It is included in fs/adfs/file.c, again for no observable reason, except
  maybe because fs/adfs/file.c is based on fs/ext2/file.c.
* As a result of including ext2_fs.h indirectly, the ext2-specific
  test_opt() macro was being used in fs/ufs/ialloc.c, which was creating
  bogus GID inheritance for new files in UFS, by randomly checking Ext2
  fields holding UFS data.  BSD (hence UFS) semantics mean files inherit
  the dir GID always.  Maybe UFS needs a sysvgroups/nogrpid mount option?
* UDF has the same problem as UFS (referencing u.ext2_i "data"), so I fixed it
  to have SYSV semantics.  I don't know if this is correct or not, but at
  least it is not random behaviour...  The UDF and UFS problems are probably
  rarely seen, as these filesystems are mostly used read-only under Linux.
Please consider the following patches, for both 2.2 and 2.4.  AFAICS, the
patchew will apply cleanly to both 2.2.17 and 2.4.0-whatever.
Cheers, Andreas
PS - please CC me, as I haven't been gotten any new l-k mail yet.
