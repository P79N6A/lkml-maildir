One thing that worries me here is that the spinners will spin on a 
memory location in struct mutex, which means that the cacheline holding 
the mutex (which is likely to be under write activity from the owner) 
will be continuously shared by the spinners, slowing the owner down when 
it needs to unshare it.  One way out of this is to spin on a location in 
struct mutex_waiter, and have the mutex owner touch it when it schedules 
out.
So:
- each task_struct has an array of currently owned mutexes, appended to 
by mutex_lock()
- mutex waiters spin on mutex_waiter.wait, which they initialize to zero
- when switching out of a task, walk the mutex list, and for each mutex, 
bump each waiter's wait variable, and clear the owner array
- when unlocking a mutex, bump the nearest waiter's wait variable, and 
remove from the owner array
Something similar might be done to spinlocks to reduce cacheline 
contention from spinners and the owner.
