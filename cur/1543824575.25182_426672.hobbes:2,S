Bullshit.
-mregparm=N is an absolute order.  On i386 it has the semantics of
passing the first N dword-sized non-varadic arguments in registers
%eax, %edx, and %ecx (in that order).  The rest are passed on the
stack; that is true for any ABI.
printk() is varadic; the only argument which will be put in a register
is the formatting string (which goes into %eax).
