I have made the changes you have suggested.  See resolution below.
A v4 patch follows shortly.

OK, I think I understand the required timings now.  I will update PIO mode 1
to set RTx to 7 and PWx to 4, giving 150 ns active + 240 ns recovery
= 390 ns (> minimum 383 ns).

Yes, the code is quite repetitive.  I've collapsed it into a single
chunk of code.

Agreed.

Suggested change has been implemented.

Yes.  Check will be removed.

I will continue to abuse set_pio_mode().
