To me at least that sounds like a good solution.  I can't help but
wonder whether moving some of the usual modem line status change
processing should also be moved into the higher levels.  This will
probably make more sense if the "block till ready" code also moves,
which I think Ted was considering at one point.
However, that's probably something to think about later.
