Test again......very strange.
I can easily reproduce it on the XFS with SAN(FLX380) connected with a 
qlogic 2400 FC card.
Everything is right when I using ext3/reiser4/reiserfs with 
FLX380,qlogic 2400.
Everything is right too when I using XFS with a normal scsi storage or a 
raid storage(NOT a SAN).
