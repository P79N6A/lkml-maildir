Absolutely, saving time by mering printks is rather stupid. That said,
I'm totally sick of "<4>" all over the place. You might not see it on
your VGA, but it leakes everywhere else and is annoying. As far as
I am concerned, every printk must end with a newline and this is why
I disagreed with your  printk(log_lvl);
