You get basic hotplug of input devices using xf86-input-evdev with
current versions, though you'd need current git for reasonable quality
tablet support.  That may still lack some of the wacom specific bits.
(I'd have to look to see what the wacom driver does that
xf86-input-evdev doesn't do.)
Hotplug with arbitrary drivers is a harder job, and I'm still not sure
if we're talking having that done in 7.2 or 7.3.  But it is coming.
All of that said, I'm going to have to agree with others, don't do it in
the kernel, because the need to do it in the kernel is going away.
