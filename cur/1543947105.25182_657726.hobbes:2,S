Hi David,
I am trying to spot the numbers that show the sweet spot for this 
optimization, without much success so far.
Who is supposed to win big?  Is this mainly about reducing the load on 
the server, or is the client supposed to win even with a lightly loaded 
server?
When you say Ext3 cache vs NFS cache is the first on the server and the 
second on the client?
Regards,
Daniel
