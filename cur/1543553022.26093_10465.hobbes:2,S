Fine.  I was forced to use it from 2.3.99-something and
have not had any problems with it.  (I lifted whole system
from one disk to another and forgot to create /dev :)

I have devfsd 1.3.10.
You better be sure you have following lines in devfsd.conf:
REGISTER        .*              MKOLDCOMPAT
UNREGISTER      .*              RMOLDCOMPAT
You can later reconfigure most stuff to use new layout
but especially X is a pain.
