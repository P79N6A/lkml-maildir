No, this is a pci-core only header file.  I really don't want to have
these in include/linux/pci.h as no one other than the pci core, or pci
hotplug drivers need to use it.
I guess I could create,
include/linux/pci-core-only-dont-use-unless-you-really-know-what-you-are-doing.h
but that might be a bit rude :)
