Well, here I have some.
The tests involved kernel compiled (2.4.18) from a make mrproper, single
nbench, and unixbench (likely the most useful).
The output from tests can be found at 
http://www.hardrock.org/HT-results/
Results consist of (all with hyperthreading on and off):
o timed make bzImage and make modules using -j2 -j4 and -j6.
o BYTEmark output (single run)
o BYTE UNIX Benchmarks (Version 4.1.0) log, report, and times
o output from /proc/cpu
o output from /proc/interrupts
o output from dmesg (sorry, one of them has the top clipped).
o output from lspci -v
From the results what I see is that if you are running a system with
many concurrent tasks then hyperthreading makes sense.  Many
concurrent systems (the -j4 and -j6 kernel compiles for example)
do see improvements.  Although this is not a very analytical test, I don't
have time for 10 iterations of each to get a better set of numbers.
Thanks to all and regards,
James Bourne
