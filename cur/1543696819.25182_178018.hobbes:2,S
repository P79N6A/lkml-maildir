Are you sure you want to handle it this way?  I'm not sure the code is
very useful in its current state--I think we might be better off
downloading an old kernel version for reference and writing new code for
drivers/xtalk.
Then again, starting with the existing mips code might be even better
since we know that worked at one point.
