This just got into BitKeeper, about 10 hours ago:
> [PATCH] x86-64 update

> Make everything compile and boot again.
>
> The earlier third party ioport.c changes unfortunately

>
> - Update defconfig
> - Some minor cleanup
> - Introduce physid_t for APIC masks (fixes UP kernels)
> - Finish ioport.c merge and fix compilation
Several days ago, I mailed Andi Kleen a build log which
showed that ioport.c builds perfectly well on x86-64.
The whole 2.6.0-test4 kernel does in fact, as downloaded
from kernel.org. Andi Kleen agreed...
...and now this comment gets submitted to Linus, ending
up in BitKeeper. I'd like this changed. I realize that
it may be a rather difficult thing to change at this point,
but it is clearly wrong.
