Btw, if you're interesting in helping out in this area a little bit,
it would be nice if we could split up and move ufs_fs.h a little bit.
We should have an:
  fs/ufs/ufs.h for all driver internal declarations
  fs/ufs/ufs_layout.h that purely defines the layout can can be copied
                      directly into other tools that need the ufs layout
		      like silo
