The fact that we know in advance that a system is only going to a very
small number of these timers should be noted. You could just use a
regular list , and limit the total number of timers . I would hesitate
to stick a big data structure in when your only dealing with one or two
timers on average..
George, what's largest number of highres timers that someone might
need/want?
