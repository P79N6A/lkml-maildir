`man patch` would be your friend here:
       -pnum  or  --strip=num
          Strip the smallest prefix containing num leading  slashes  from
each  file  name
          found  in  the patch file.  A sequence of one or more adjacent
slashes is counted
          as a single slash.  This controls how file names found  in  the
patch  file  are
          treated, in case you keep your files in a different directory than
the person who
          sent out the patch.  For example, supposing the file name in the
patch file was
             /u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c
          setting -p0 gives the entire file name unmodified, -p1 gives
             u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c
          without the leading slash, -p4 gives
             blurfl/blurfl.c
          and not specifying -p at all just gives you blurfl.c.  Whatever
you end  up  with
          is  looked for either in the current directory, or the directory
specified by the
          -d option.
