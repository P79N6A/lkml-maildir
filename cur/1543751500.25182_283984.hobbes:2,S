Actually you don't even need a microcontroler: use an IC like the TI
PCM2902 (
http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/pcm2902.html
). I
built a headphone amplifier that uses one and I'm very pleased -
especially because there's digital passthrough for my speakers via
S/PDIF. The quality is nothing special, but you can always
plug a high-end codec into the S/PDIF I/O. I saw a schematic
somewhere that used the PCM2902 as the USB-audio interface along with
a high end DAC. However if you need more than 16 bits and 48kHz you
might need to make something more fancy.
