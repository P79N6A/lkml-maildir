 Yes, sorry that's what I thought you wanted to do (Ie. you new some
data was there and wanted to get it quickly).

 Ahh I didn't know that.

 If you want to return imediatley (and there might not be data) the
answer given is usually...
 sigqueue( ... );
 sigwaitinfo( ... );
 If the above will still schedule, then Linus might be more likely to
take a patch (I'd guess that he'd look at sigtimedwait() to be like
sleep() in most other cases though).
