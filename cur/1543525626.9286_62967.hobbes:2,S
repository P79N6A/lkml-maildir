All 2.3.x kernels I tried here before, 20 <= x <= 42, gave severe ext2
filesystem corruption, fixed with 2.3.42aa2 and in 2.3.43 AFAIKS, so I
didn't look closely in between. Also, mounting a CD on 2.3.43 hangs the
machine for good. SysRq setting does the same, so...
2.2.15pre7 (current kernel here) works fine. It reverted to Revision 2.56
of the CD driver, 2.2.15pre6 had 3.06 like the current 2.3 kernels and
gives the same messages. On 2.2.15pre6 mounting the CD works fine.
