The biggest reason that I suggest this is because when I wrote the 
abstracted PI I gave the user of the API the choice to do RT tasks only or 
all tasks. In the case of fusyn or futex , they will do all tasks .. Once 
you throw in one structure that does all tasks , they may as well all be 
doing it. Or that's how I feel.
