 From strace output which Trever sent, OO.o seems to be getting many 
-EINTRs (Interrupted System Call) which are attempted to be restarted 
but again recieve EINTR when restarted. (futex, accept and poll are the 
ones which get EINTR).
Whereas, when OO.o successfully starts up on my machine, I get no EINTRs 
at all.
Stephen - Is it possible for you to post strace from your machine ? If 
you see the same symptoms we can look at what changed in that area.
Thanks
Parag
