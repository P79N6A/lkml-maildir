I was refering to Intel, not ARM hardware. You can look at the
setup code in your architecture specific tree and see if you
can figure it out. I have never even seen ARM hardware, much
less used it so I can't help there.
FYI, what you get from ioremap() is not a number that will mean
anything, even when it's mapped to the physical address. Often,
on some kernel versions, just to prevent module writers from
cheating, it is poisoned so it only works with the defined
macros. Therefore, it is a "cookie", not something you can
initialize a pointer with.
However, in Intel, for hacking only, the address that you can
use to initialize a pointer with is the address you re-mapped,
ORed with PAGE_OFFSET. If the address is below 1 megabyte,
there is a 1:1 mapping of virtual to physical addresses in
the Intel Linux kernel. This allows the page table to exist
at an address that can be accessed from 32-bit linear-mode
startup.
This is useful if you want to access something physical. For instance
if you want to find the physical address of bad memory. A user-mode
memory checker can exercise memory until something failed. Then it
can write some magic numbers on both sides of the failing address.
A kernel module could then search for the magic numbers, returning
the 32-bit linear offset of the bad memory. This is quicker than
writing a module to scan all the PTEs, returning the translation
offset.
