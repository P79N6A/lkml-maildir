There are no similar applications like the Exchange Server or the
BizTalk server for Linux. I'd see them port all of the server portions
of these applications to an *ix platform (be it MacOS X, *BSD or
Linux) in quite short time. The management GUIs and application
development tools will stay on Windows, however.
Basically the same thing, many other server platform vendors (Oracle,
InterSystems Cache are the ones I spontanously remember) do. You get 1
(one) Linux Server in the company running the server and be able to
keep 100 (one hundred) % of the desktops on Windows. Sounds like a
good deal for M$ to me.
