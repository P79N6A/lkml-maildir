What you are missing is a property provided by the old method.
We have the NET_RX_SOFTIRQ that floods very heavily, so far so good.
Then we have HI_SOFTIRQ, incidentally HI_SOFTIRQ from irq wants to be
executed with very low latency, with your patch it _can_ be postpone to
ksoftirqd processing just because there's the NET_RX_SOFTIRQ cpu hog in
background. With the old method it was guaranteed that the HI_SOFTIRQ
was executed with very low latency within the irq, no matter of the
NET_RX_SOFTIRQ flood.
So there _is_ a difference, and the multiple-loop will tend to "hide"
the difference.
