It looks as if %gs handling isn't quite right.
pthread_setcanceltype() SIGSEGVs in THREAD_SETMEM(self, p_canceltype, type).
The instruction that fails is "mov %dl,%gs:0x81", and %gs is zero.
RedHat linked /bin/sleep against libpthread.so, which (at least in the
glibc-2.2.93 used in RedHat 8.0) causes the nanosleep() system call
to be wrapped between a pair of pthread_setcanceltype() calls.
That's why /bin/sleep failed. Compile it yourself w/o -lpthread and it works.
Also: running gdb on a live process didn't work. I got "int3" errors in
the kernel's log, and gdb seemed to hang or loop somewhere. Postmortem
debugs of core files worked ok though.
