Hi,
with kernel 2.2.17 I need to have a
function in my driver to handle some data.
I used BH with tq_immediate, but I found
out, that my function need to be called
outside of interrupt context, but still as
soon as I need it. 
So I decided to use the tq_scheduler queue and
put my function on the task_queue in my interrupt handler.
It seems to work good without SMP, but with SMP
my function is called with delays of many msecs.
Since the tq_scheduler queue is only started from
schedule(), do I need to set some flag to run schedule
asap ?
Or has someone better idea for my function ?
Thanx,
Armin
