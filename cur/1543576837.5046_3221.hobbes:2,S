Cool.
Maybe your libc is different on the different machines? Normal programs
shouldn't use segments at all, so I really do not see how this patch could
matter in the least, even if it was completely and utterly buggy (which is
not obvious at first glance).
I wonder why you seem to have an LDT at all..

Would you mind trying to hunt this down a bit more? In particular, it
would be good to see if the behaviour is the same if you do the typedef
change but leave the other logic alone. That would also cut down on the
purely syntactic changes of the patch.
I'll take a look at the code here.
