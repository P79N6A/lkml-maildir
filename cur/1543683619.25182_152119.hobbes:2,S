Just another thought on that is to make sure they don't get requeued to start 
with just 2 ticks left - which would happen to all nice 0 tasks running their 
full timeslice. Here is what I'm doing in O10:
+	} else if (!((task_timeslice(p) - p->time_slice) %
+		TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY) && (p->time_slice > MIN_TIMESLICE) &&
+		(p->array == rq->active)) {
