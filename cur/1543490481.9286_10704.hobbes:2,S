I can't comment on this.

Just create two different modules for full and half-duplex.

Basically, you don't need much documentation: It just works. The only
unser visible differences from kmod to kerneld is that you don't have to
start it explicitly (as it is a kernel thread) and you have to remove the
unused modules with a cron job, if you need to automatically do it.
For your fs problems: Get the latest util-linux (2.9i) and create a
/etc/filesystems file.
