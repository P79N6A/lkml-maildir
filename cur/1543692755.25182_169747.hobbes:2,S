Don't know which Unix you are referring to, but on Solaris and Linux,
the delete (unlink) and create file operations are subject to directory
permissions. Thus, deleting a file requires write permission on the
directory. The write permission on a file allows to modify its contents
and has nothing to do with being able to delete it.
Thus, what you are seeing is completely normal:
1. mkdir /mydir
2. cd /mydir
3. chmod 777 .
4. touch myfile
5. chmod 444 myfile
Anyone will be able to delete "myfile" since the directory where it
belongs (mydir) has full write privileges for anyone.
I recommend you using the sticky bit on shared directories, like /tmp.
If a directory has the sticky bit enabled, a file can only be deleted by
its owner (and root, of course):
1. mkdir /mydir
2. cd /mydir
3. chmod 1777 .
4. touch myfile
Now, "myfile" can only be deleted by its owner (or root), since the
directory where it belongs is marked with the sticky bit.
