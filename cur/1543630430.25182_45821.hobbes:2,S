This is a mistake.
You need to choose other, more recent format.
It is highly unlikely you might have format of version <=3.5.9
If you have not done rebuild-tree after that again - you may do
--rebuild-sb and choose more recent format, then it should help.

First of all make sure that your raid array same up fully.
This is very important! Check all the partitions if they are of correct size.
Then do rebild-sb and choose more correct superblock version (if asked).
If you are not asked for the fs version, that's bad. Let us know then.
After that you might try to do --rebuild-sb and that one should help.
I see this --rebuild-sb causes a lot of confusion for people, when it asks
the format, I am going to make it to offer some hints.
Thanks for your report.
Bye,
