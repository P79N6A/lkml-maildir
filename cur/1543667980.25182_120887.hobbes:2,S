No, those swap_free and swap_dup errors appear when a page table has been
corrupted, and we don't swap out page tables themselves, just the pages
they point to.  There's no reason to suspect the swap device at all.

The kernel version would help to identify the page_alloc.c:145 BUG.
But it's likely to correspond to freeing an impossible or already-freed
page, because of the corrupted page table (odd numbered corruption looks
like a valid page, even numbered corruption looks like a swap entry).
Sorry, I've no guess to make on what might be corrupting this memory.
