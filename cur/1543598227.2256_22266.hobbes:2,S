No, I won't make 'ps' do that. Ever wonder why 'ps' doesn't
sort processes by default? It isn't OK to suck up lots of
memory or reparse the files. This is bad for performance and
causes extra trouble when a kernel bug causes /proc/42/status to
freeze the 'ps' process.
Also your proposal would require 'ps' to _always_ read the
data for _every_ process in the system.

Either... hex is nice I guess.

Nah, this gets you enough:   (unsigned)(ptr_to_mm>>sizeof(long))

Nope. This is not enough for sane thread support in 'ps'.
Information is lost across the kernel-user boundry. It would
be relatively easy for the kernel to provide a /proc directory
listing that groups processes by mm_struct. Without this, 'ps'
would have to regenerate the lost information in an inefficient
way.
BTW, 'ps' is now here:

The PID may wrap.

On an SSI cluster, way more I'd guess.

You also dirty the cache and suffer load misses.
