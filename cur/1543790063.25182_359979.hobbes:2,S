Halloween comes a week early to the Morton household.  The patch from
hell, circa April 2004, lives on to haunt Andrew <grin>.
By the time we (wli, rusty, colpatch, ...) incorporated the following
various constraints on these cpumask/nodemask macros, we were fortunate
to only violate the "obvious to the programmer" constraint on the
implementation internals:
  - near perfect code gen on small systems (1 word masks)
  - near perfect code gen on large systems (multiword masks)
  - type checking on arguments
  - keep the existing macro-style calling conventions:
	cpus_and(result, input1, input2)
  - a single bitmap internal implementation - the rest just wrappers
  - dramatic shinkage of kernel source devoted to this stuff
  - reduction in kernel text size across all architectures.
Probably it is best that we not ask too many questions at this time ;).
