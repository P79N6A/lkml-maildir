This problem has been around since kernel 2.6.16, and I see it in
2.6.23.1-10.fc7. It occurs in the ufs_check_page function of ufs/dir.c
at the Espan test, which seems unnecessary for NextStep/OpenStep
files systems. The following patch preserves the test for other file
systems and makes the mount useful for NextStep/OpenStep:
(against the 2.6.23.1-10.fc7 source tree)
dsb@Zeno-Dyn[1012]$ diff dir.c dir.c.orig
108,110d107
<       unsigned mnext = UFS_SB(sb)->s_mount_opt &
<         (UFS_MOUNT_UFSTYPE_NEXTSTEP || UFS_MOUNT_UFSTYPE_NEXTSTEP_CD ||
<          UFS_MOUNT_UFSTYPE_OPENSTEP);
131c128
<               if ((mnext == 0) & (((offs + rec_len - 1) ^ offs) & 
~chunk_mask))
