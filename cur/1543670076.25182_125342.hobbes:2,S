  Well, that matches what 2.4 does:
00:0d.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371SB PIIX3 IDE [Natoma/Triton II]
00:10.0 Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc. 20268 (rev 02)
01:0b.0 Unknown mass storage controller: Triones Technologies, Inc. HPT366 / HPT370 (rev 03)
  2.5 nonmodular seems to be doing it in BIOS order  -- the HPT370 BIOS
initializes before the Promise (and won't let it boot but I can deal
with that.)  I'll probably replace it with a PDC20262 before looking
at any code...
