	Yes, but there is a nice simplicity in saying filesystems that
support 64bit device numbers get the expanded space, and filesystems
that cannot are limited to 16bits.  Most modern systems would have an
updated set of filesystems.  All pre-existing filesystems have only
16bit device numbers.  All new mknod64() calls will only work on
filesystems that can store 64bits.
