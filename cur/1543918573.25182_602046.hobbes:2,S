What does your "ulimit -s" say?
I suspect that you might hit the code that limits execve() arguments to 
one quarter of the maximum stack size.
We could change that from 25% to something else (half? three quarters?), 
but if you really are hitting that limit, it sounds like you may have a 
really small stack size to begin with (ie if 25% is smaller than the old 
argument size limit of 128kB, you're running with a stack limit of less 
than half a meg, which sounds pretty dang small).
So I'd like to verify that the stack limit really is the issue, and not 
something else.
