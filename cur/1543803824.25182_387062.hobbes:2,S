Are there any web archives of l-k that give out the email address of
the author?
I can tell the author of the virtualisation patches hasn't even tried to
compile them.  Here's one example:
- host->host_no, tmp->pid, tmp->device->id, tmp->device->lun, tmp->result);
+ host->host_no, tmtask_pid(p), tmp->device->id, tmp->device->lun, tmp->result);
