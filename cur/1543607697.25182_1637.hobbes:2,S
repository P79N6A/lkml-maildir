Well the thing is this system has never had working sound. I've got 2 of 
these machines, both with the array fix, and neither get sound. I've tried 
2.4.7 (which didn't have the array fix), 2.4.9, 2.4.12, 2.4.13, and I'm 
about to try some earlier kernels, but since this chip is "notoriously new" 
I would not be suprised if it's not returning anything for what should be 
valid codec calls. Will take a peek and get back to you.
PS: This is one of these SiS630S all in one integrated things, and also one 
of the offenders in that SiS FrameBuffer stuff we've been discussing, so I 
wouldn't be suprised in anomalies at all.
