I can easily answer this for Ingo.
Yes, spin_lock(lock) is blocking since lock is mutex, not a spinlock under
preempt-rt. But isn't it easy to fix? Replace the two lines by
spin_lock_irqsave(flags). That would work for both preempt-rt
and !preempt-rt.
You supposed to ask if the macro name spin_lock() isn't confusing. It very
much is, but one of Ingo's aims is not to change existing code too much.
The purist would probably change all instances of spin_lock() to lock() or
down() to stop refering to a specific lock type when it can be changed
with config-options. That would, however, require a large patch,
which does the preempt-rt branch harder to merge with the main-line.
