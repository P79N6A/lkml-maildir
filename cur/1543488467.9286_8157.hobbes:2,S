heck, i've done it legally with two purchased licenses of the
software for each hostid -- however, the goal was to have
two IDENTICAL machines. So, hostid trick on boot to both
setting the serial number to the first, and shared raid drives
for everything, where the second machine acted as a cold
spare (only turned on if prime went belly up).
nutshell: userspace programs ask the OS what the unique
identifier is. This is a rather easy thing to change, flip
the system call to something umm....more useful...
