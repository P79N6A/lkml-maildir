No, tried it now. Had to hand-apply 2 chunks because of kmalloc changes 
but it was trivial and probably correct. It seems to find nothing bad:
pnp: building resource template
pnp: encoding resources
pnp: irq flags are correct
pnp: setting resources
pnp: _SRS worked correctly
pnp: Device 00:0a activated.
