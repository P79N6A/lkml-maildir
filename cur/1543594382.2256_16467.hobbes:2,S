It can be, of course. However I never experienced problems when 
using the 'regular' X server, but quite often when using the 
patched server from gatos.
And since the driver delivers YUV data in both cases, I see
no difference (from its point of vue) between the two uses.

I said that YUV conversion and scaling _do_ work in hardware. Actually,
using a capture size of 320x240 I can use those hardware features
and scale the image to full screen and I get all the 30 fps.
It seems however to work pretty bad in 640x480... but maybe it is
my setup here...

Neither do I :-)
