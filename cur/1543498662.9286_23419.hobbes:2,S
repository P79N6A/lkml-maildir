I've been thinking exactly the same thing about all this khttpd stuff.
For the record, I have 2 dozen virtual servers over 3 machines. Some of
the virtual servers share content via NFS. Most of the pages are either
PHP3 or perl based CGI. Images are usually static, but not always (I've
done some horrible tricks with .gif being an executable type, which has
an embedded PHP3/GD script to do on-the-fly watermarking, etc).
So to me this khttpd stuff is useless. I won't be using it. I'll go buy
a beefier machine if content gets too slow, because if it gets too slow
it's because the dynamic content is chewing up cycles, not because I am
dealing with too many hits (I can already handle 100s of hits/minute on
a pentium with dynamic content, that's more than 150,000 hits/day).
This khttpd stuff isn't real world. If it becomes part of apache, and I
don't have to change any configuration files to use it, then it may get
used. But if I have to start separating dynamic/static content, and use
multiple configuration files, or throw away virtual servers, or use non
standard ports, then khttpd just becomes an academic exercise.
