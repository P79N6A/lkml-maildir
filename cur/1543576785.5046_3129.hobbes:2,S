I have the same transmit timeout problem, but with a D-Link via rhine
board. I'm running -test10, and it seems to happen under high
(interrupt?) load with both heavy disk and network
activity. Interestingly, it appears to happen more often when the other
end of the network activity is a 10BaseT link. I'm using a Netgear
dual-speed hub.
Do you think these might be related?
