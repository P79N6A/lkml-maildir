   All other CPUs must observe the preceding stores before the following
   stores.
 ...
   Does this do the trick?
              membar #StoreStore
Yes.
   The IPIs and related junk are I believe needed only on Alpha, which has
   no single memory-barrier instruction that can do wmbdd()'s job.  Given
   that Alpha seems to be on its way out, this did not seem to me to be
   too horrible.
I somehow doubt that you need an IPI to implement the equivalent of
"membar #StoreStore" on Alpha.  Richard?
Franks a lot,
