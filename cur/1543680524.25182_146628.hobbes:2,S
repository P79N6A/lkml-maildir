Is it possible for readdir to return really empty directory - without
and entry, even "." and ".."?
The reason is, to enable full FAM/dnotify support for supermount I
have to allow open of non-mounted root and - if possible - readdir
in this case. Any attepmpt to simulate "." and ".." in this case
will result in races between kernel/user space, so the best case
would be just return nothing (meaning empty directory).
TIA
