Hey cool!

Better just don't do devfs :-). But anyway...
Well I'm planing to add kernel version tagging of fstab line enties
to util-linux. This seems to be the only way to make major/minor
transitions (and the more I think about it the more I'm convinced
that they will be unevitable at some not so distant point in time!)
Something along the lines of:
cat /etc/fstab:
/dev/hdc                /                       ext3    v2.4,defaults    1 1
/dev/sda1 
         /                       ext3    v2.5,defaults    1 1
LABEL=/boot             /boot                   ext3    defaults        1 2
/dev/fd0                /mnt/floppy             auto    noauto,owner    0 0
# /dev/loop1            /mnt/1                  auto    noauto,owner    0 0
# /dev/loop2            /mnt/2                  auto    noauto,owner    0 0
none                    /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
none                    /tmp                    tmpfs   defaults        0 0
none                    /dev/pts                devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0
/dev/hda6               swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
Would be *very* convenient for this purpose and solve 99.9999% percent
of portability problems. Well the above syntax may be the esiest to
imeplement however the below syntax would be perhaps more palatable:
2.5:/dev/sda1 
		/		ext3 ....
Opinnions?
perhaps a similar adjustments would be required for the kernel root parameter of 
course.
With something along
root=2.5:/dev/sda1,2.4:/dev/hdc
one could be living with... The respecive kernel would just pick the entry
which is matching it's version and be fine.
