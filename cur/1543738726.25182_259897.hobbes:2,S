Voilà ;-)
I agree that this looks really smooth from a scheduler point of view.
From a user point of view, remains the issue of suspending the tasks:
-find which tasks to suspend : how do you know that job 'a' consists 
exactly of 'a1' and 'a2'
-suspend them (btw, how do you achieve this ? kill -STOP ?)
I've been away from my mail and still trying to catch up, nevermind if the 
above does not makes sense to you.
