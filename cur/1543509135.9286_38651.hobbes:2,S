Hi,
  Working on a RedHat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5),
    we want to have about 5000 file handles open concurrently by each of
3 processes on one host.
 We have added the following in /etc/rc.d/rc.local
  echo 16384 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
ulimit -nH and ulimit -nS both return 1024.
We now seem to need to ulimit -nH 5000 and ulimit -nS 5000 before
running the above processes, BUT this is only allowed from root shells.
The processes are to run as regular user processes.
Is there a way to avoid going through a root shell and then 'su' to the
user before running the process?
Is there a way to perhaps ulimit for all processes on the machine? Or
add this to the programs themselves?
Thanks,
    Arie Rudich
