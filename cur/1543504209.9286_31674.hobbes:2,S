Unfortunately, that won't really do. We can, of course,
just increase the range of nice levels, but all that does
is increase the current "maximum deadlock time".
It's all a question of compromise. We have to choose and
my patch gives (through sysctl) root the choice whether to
enable SCHED_IDLE or not.
I know there are quite a lot of people willing to put rc5des
and other distributed computing apps on large Beowulf clusters
if we have SCHED_IDLE. It's also useful for compressing MP3s,
etc... It's turned off by default and people have to enable
it by hand if they feel they need it.
I really don't see why we should keep root from shooting
himself in the foot -- IIRC that's been Unix tradition :)
