Userland struct dirent is:
struct dirent
  {
#ifndef __USE_FILE_OFFSET64
    __ino_t d_ino;
    __off_t d_off;
#else
    __ino64_t d_ino;
    __off64_t d_off;
#endif
    unsigned short int d_reclen;
    unsigned char d_type;
    char d_name[256];           /* We must not include limits.h! */
  };
(since 1997 or so), so with the extended getdents syscall glibc would need
to memmove every name by 1 byte.

This has a few problems:
- unless glibc is configured to assume 2.6.4+ kernel, it would need to
  do on first readdir one small getdents (instead of as big getdents as
  needed)
- how to find what is the right small size for the test (it would need to
  retry if it did not fit any entries)
- and if on the old kernel, it would need to seek back so that getdents64
  can be used
Yes, this would only happen the first time getdents is called, but still,
aren't syscalls quite cheap?
