Errrrm.. A couple of thoughts (which I haven't been able to test ATM, 'cos
nfs.o doesn't load) about this:
1) If you rmmod nfs, and then cat /proc/slabinfo, it'll segfault 'cos the name
won't be in memory any more.
2) if you re-insert nfs.o having rmmod'd it, the kmem_cache_create calls will
fail, as the cache already exists.
Am I right?
The comments at the top of mm/slab.c say something about putting module's
cachep's in memory which is not unloaded. I don't know if this is possible
(perhaps by putting it in a different section of some sort).
The easier solution seems to be to add a function to slab.c to search for
a named cache and return a pointer to it (and kmem_cache_shrink() the cache
when the module is unloaded).
