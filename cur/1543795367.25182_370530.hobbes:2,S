Gene-
These other dependencies have always been there, except that nxt200x and 
lgdt330x are relatively new frontends.
The difference is that a new Kconfig / Makefile feature is allowing us 
to only select the specific frontend needed by your hardware... 
Previously, all frontend support was forced to be built-in.
You and Adrian have clearly demonstrated that this frontend selection 
capability isn't working properly.  I think I will send Linus a patch to 
restore previous functionality, forcing all frontends to be built... 
Then I will resubmit a patch to Andrew that will re-enable this frontend 
selection support, and I'll ask him to hold it in -mm until we can work 
out the bugs.
The problem is that you are selecting cx88-dvb to be built-in to the 
kernel (not as a module) , but the frontends are being built as modules 
only.  This is a problem.
You can make it all work, if you select the option to build support for 
ALL FRONTENDS  (this is the same as the older functionality)... This 
option was selected by default in menuconfig. ... If you do not want to 
have all frontends supported, then you should be fine if you recompile 
the kernel again, but be sure to compile cx88 and cx88-dvb as MODULES 
(m) ... and not in-kernel (y)
