we dont have to handle count and owner atomically across all CPUs. We have
to guarantee critical section atomicity, and we have to guarantee that
recursive down()'s are properly resolved _iff_ we are the 'owner' of the
lock. But this is only relevant to the 'owner'. (thus it doesnt have to be
atomic, only it has to be within the critical section)
