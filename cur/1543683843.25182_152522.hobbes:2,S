It looks like the loop device may not be correctly initialized yet,
no I/O is possible to it yet.

I have never used a crypto loop device, so I cannot what is really
going on. Some initialization step may be missing in the loop device
which means it is not usable, the mount it happening because the
kernel was told to mount it. If you are not specifying a filesystem
type, then possibly what is happening is it is attempting to open
the device as different filesystems, these all fail, until xfs
which does not detect the underlying error on the loop device,
and issues the IO which causes the BUG.
So, we caused the crash, but you were on your way to one anyway,
eventually it would have failed to find a root device and given
up that way.
