Subject: delayed permission checks in 2.6

While exploring some of the source I found out that some permission checks 
are made too late. For example the sys_mount function in 2.6-test1: It gets 
4 pages to put the type, the path, the dev name and the options. It then 
locks the kernel, check for magic numbers and other sanity checks, 
interprets the flags, does the mount point dentry lookup(which might spend 
some time sleeping) and after all that it checks for CAP_SYS_ADMIN. Is there 
any serious reason for this delay at the permission checks?
