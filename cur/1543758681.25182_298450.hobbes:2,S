Yes, at least these are quite common with embedded systems, quite often
without fbcon. It makes little sense to keep the driver constantly loaded
if the device is not being used as a console and is only seeing
occasional use.
It seems more sensible to just fix up the drivers that don't do this
right.. most of the broken drivers seem to be geared at x86 anyways where
people generally don't seem to care.
It may not make a lot of sense with distributions on x86, though it is
useful if you are doing driver development on a secondary device. This is
certainly a corner case though.
