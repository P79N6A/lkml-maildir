This is an updated version of the kernel voltage & current regulator
framework based on comments received from version 3 of the patch series.
The regulator framework is designed to provide a standard kernel
interface to control voltage and current regulators on SoC based
systems.
The intention is to allow systems to dynamically control regulator power
output in order to save power and prolong battery life. This applies to
both voltage regulators (where voltage output is controllable) and
current sinks (where current limit is controllable).
