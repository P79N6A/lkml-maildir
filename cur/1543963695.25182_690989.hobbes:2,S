 It may not be worth the effort, but if done in bulk for all the users in
the tree, there should be no problem with that.  I am fairly sure there
were changes of this kind from time to time, with occasional screams heard
in response from some dark corners, but no big pain.  We obviously
explicitly disregard out-of-tree users and for occasional contributors
asking: "Where the * has this function gone?" there is the Documentation/
tree to provide a greppable reference, so generally not a big deal.

 Hmm, technically you do not seem to be responsible to accept changes
under drivers/rtc/, so I will split them anyway for others to decide.  In
particular I do plan to submit a separate change for header ordering for
the driver, just out of curiosity to see how long it will stay unspoilt.  
Somehow most if not all changes of this kind that I ever made to files in
our tree have survived to the present day. :-)

 It will go separately though as not directly related to this
modification, now that I have started splitting it.
