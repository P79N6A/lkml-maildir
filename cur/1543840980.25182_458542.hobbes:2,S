I am working on a small module doing something like that, changing IP 
addresses before the NAT code sees them, in mangle.
  
http://jengelh.hopto.org/f/xt_MAP-v0.tar.bz2
I still cannot get outgoing mangled packets (see command below) to reach 
their destination:
  iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -d 134.76.13.21 -j MAP \
    --map-dest 134.76.13.28
ping and TCP packets seem to leave the box (tcpdump), but there are no 
responses (neither negative responses). The destination box's tcpdump also 
shows nothing.
netfilter list, am I missing something like recalculating IP checksums?
