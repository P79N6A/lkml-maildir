The point is illustrating differences between devfs and sysfs, since you
seem to be saying "they do the same thing" over and over, when really, they
don't.

At the very least, sysfs' and devfs' approaches to devices differ in
philosophy. devfs says "here's a device node, you can tell where it is
in the bus hierarchy by looking at its filename". sysfs, on the other
hand, says "here's the device hierarchy", and gives you enough information
to create device nodes for each point in the hierarchy if you wish to do
so.

This is kind of like saying "bzImage sets root partition location policy
because it uses whatever was the root partition when you made the image".
Which is bogus, that's what root= is for.
sysfs is in no way setting naming policy by exporting the LSB naming scheme.
First of all, sysfs isn't even creating the device nodes - that, of course,
is udev's (or whatever else you might want to use) job. You're right,
actually - if you're using udev, files the sysfs static names *don't* exist -
*unless* your udev is configured to use them. If not, then obviously the
sysfs names don't matter at all.

As I understand it, devfs actually creates device nodes, but devfsd can
request that the names be changed. (Granted, my understanding of the Linux
devfs implementation is far from complete.) "Exporting the information into
device nodes" is kind of silly to claim as a minimal exercise, when creating
the device nodes is the end goal of the software.

This is like arguing that a file named foo with an accompanying file named
foo.acl is "very nearly" a file with an ACL. Or, more dramatically, like
equating a nuclear warhead with instructions on making U-238. The information
is there in sysfs, granted, but it's not in a directly usable form by itself.

ps requires /proc :3
The difference between sysfs and devfs, in this regard, is fairly simple. By
just turning on devfs support, you've suddenly changed the behaviour of the
system (device node creation and naming) once /dev is mounted. By turning on
sysfs, the behaviour of the system doesn't change at all, even when /sys is
mounted.

Why should the kernel create the device nodes? Sure, it's "just an extra
step", but the general Linux philosophy is that "just extra steps" don't
belong inside the kernel. Why should the kernel do more work?
