I'm seeing also - this is with 2.4.19-pre3aa2 -
and I know I saw it with earlier 2.4 kernels.
I just checked and I'm seeing it on my
workstation here, running 2.4.19-pre8-ac5.
I'd have a working ethernet interface, with
a functional default route - now if I bring up
a virtual address on the same ethernet
device, all outgoing traffic from that point
on emanates from the IP of the new virtual
interface - which created some problems
if there are firewall rules based on IP addr.
I know there is some way to fix this with the
advanced routing features, but I hadn't time
to look into it until now - and the above does
seem to be the default behavior.
