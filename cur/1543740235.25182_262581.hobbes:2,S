Maybe, but if this kind of cleanup work is done on this code,
I want it sat in -mm for quite a while. This code has been
quite fragile in the past, and I've lost count how many
times we've broken some Intel i8xx variant inadvertantly.
The fragility is a good indicator however to just how crap
that code actually is, and was one of my motivations for
moving the EM64T stuff to the -mch driver.
