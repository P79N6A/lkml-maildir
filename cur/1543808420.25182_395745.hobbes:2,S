It is not.
powernow-k8 needs to know if ac is plugged, else it can overload
battery.
backlight code needs it for get current brightness.
on Zauruses, battery charging is done in kernel (not in
hardware). Battery charging obviously needs to know if ac is
connected.
on Zauruses, IIRC backlight control code needs to know ac/dc, because
voltage differs on some internal buses and backlight power needs to be
programmed in different way.

It is not policy decision, it is protect-hardware-from-damage on
embedded platorms/pn-k8.
