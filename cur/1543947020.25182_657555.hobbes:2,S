Hi Markus,
Yes, this was discussed back in November on linux-mm and hence my
patch. I didn't push for it to be merged by itself because I don't
think it makes sense to merge it separately from the full metronomefb
patch. As far as I can tell, only hecubafb and metronomefb seem to be
the consumers.
Out of curiosity, are you using defio or planning to use it? I would
love to hear back from people who are using it.
Thanks,
jaya
