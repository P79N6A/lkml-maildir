	I've been surprised at how well it works to put each character on a
separate line, pipe the input into diff3 and then join the lines
back together.  For example, let's consider the case of
a adding parameters to a function.  Here one version adds a parameter
before the existing parameter, and another version adds another parameter
after the existing parameter:
$ cat orig
call(bar);
$ cat ver1
call(foo,bar);
$ cat ver2
call(bar,baz);
$ charmerge ver1 orig ver2
call(foo,bar,baz);
	A more practically scaled application that I tried was with
another filter that I wrote that would automatically resolve certain
types of diff3 conflicts[1].  With that filter, I took the SCSI
FlashPoint driver, and made an edited version by piping it through GNU
indent, which not only reindents, but also splits and joins lines.
I made a second edited version by changing all 146 instances of
"SYNC" to "GROP" in the original.  It merged apparently successfully,
giving me a GNU indented version with all of the keyword changes.
The version of this resolution program dies if it his a diff3
conflict of a type that it is not prepared to resolve.  I'll post
it once I've got it properly preserving the conflicts that it
doesn't try to fix.  In the meantime, here is an illustrative
script to do get diff3 to do character-based merges, although it
gives garbage results if there are any conflicts.
[1] The type of conflict that was automatically resolved is as follows:
	variant1 = <prepended-new-text><original><appended-new-text>
	result --> <prepended-new-text><variant2><appended-new-text>
	...this is actually exactly the order one would want in the
case where <original> also occurs in variant2, but it was close
enough for this test.
