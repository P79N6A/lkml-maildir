For current drivers sound-slot-0 is all you will need and sound-service can
I think be off. Thats more relevant to ALSA
	sound-slot-0 says "part of soundcard 0 was opened"
	sound-service-x-y says "service x of card y"
So for soundblaster you might want sound-service-0-something hooked to load
opl3 for example
