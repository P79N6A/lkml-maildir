Yeah, I agree with you. Anyway, I've never said I will integrate that IDE 
stuff when I become the 2.2 maintainer :) ... I just said I'll think about it 
;) ... I never ever want to break 2.2, and such an update will definitively 
break things. 2.2 took a long time to become that stable like it is now and it 
can be broke within minutes. A no-go!
For users who need/want/experiment with that stuff there is still my 
2.2-secure tree.
Anyway, 2.2 needs the hashing exploit fix ASAP ;)
ciao, Marc
