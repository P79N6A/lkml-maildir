Or maybe:
#define	__FD_ISSET(d, set)	(!!((set)->fds_bits[__FDELT(d)] & __FDMASK(d)))
Which is probably better than a shift and bit-and. That then leaves it up to
the compiler as to whether the generation of 0 or 1 is actually necessary
(which if isn't if it's just the condition in an if-statement).
Or even:
#define FD_ISSET(fd,fdsetp)	(!!__FD_ISSET(fd,fdsetp))
Which would then apply to all arch's regardless.
