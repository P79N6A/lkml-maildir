Okay, more or less as expected, 650MB and 380sec (just over six minutes)
is 10.17x, allowing for OPC and fixating that's about what you would
expect.
Are you saying that a 12x burn using a 2.4 kernel and ide-scsi doesn't
take the same time? Because I see ~1.7MB/s if I use speed=12 with
ide-scsi, and that's as expected (1x = 44100*4/1024 kB/s). Haven't got a
2.6 system with a burner here, but I do at my other site.
