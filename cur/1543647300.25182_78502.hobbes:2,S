http://domsch.com/linux/megaraid/linux-2.5-megaraid-2.00rc5.patch.asc
is a patch to create 'megaraid2', the megaraid 2.00rc5 driver which
includes fixups such that it works on kernel 2.5.41.   The v2.00 
has significant code path cleanups (easier to read and maintain),
support for SCSI reservations (needed for shared storage clustering),
and will soon have an improved higher performance interface to card
firmware.  This driver is being developed by LSI, with assistance from
Red Hat and Dell.
By providing this as a megaraid2 driver, it allows development to
continue on it separate from the stable megaraid (based on 1.18)
driver already present in the 2.5.41 kernel.  This driver works at
least somewhat for me, with slighly increased performance over the
1.18-based driver.  It still likely has bugs related to being 
ported to 2.5.x.  Mike Anderson has already caught one such bug - (use
page_address(page)+offset) - fixed internally.

If there are no objections, I'll submit this to Linus and Dave Jones 
later this week for inclusion.  This has been posted to 
linux-megaraid-devel@dell.com as well.
Thanks,
Matt
