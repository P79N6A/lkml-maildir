Greetings,
In 2.0 there was a function called ip_rt_dev which took a single address as
an argument and returned a struce device ptr.  I need to do the same thing
in 2.2 (but this function doesn't exist anymore).  How can I do this (if I
don't have access to the skb)?  I've been reading kernel code for hours and
am still stumped.
thanks,
-bp
