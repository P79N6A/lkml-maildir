Not so much in fact. It breaks some programs (like MC) of course and it'll
need some rework for locks but most programs work just fine. Plus: it's NOT
a requirement. It's only default devfs layout. You are free to retune devfs
and put things where you are like them. Default layout was designed to be
clean and manageable, NOT to be 100% backword compatible.
