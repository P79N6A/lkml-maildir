i don't have windows available for testing.
i just checked on a powerbook g3 using the ohci driver, and i get
the same errors as with uhci.o on my intel.
which rules out the mobo connector.
the cable is a slightly wobbly cradle, but this model works fine for
others.
no matter how i press or tilt the ipaq, the error is the same (i.e.
no intermittent contacts obviously). 
could it possibly be anything else ?
are there any measurements i can do on the cable ?
i would expect to have two +/- voltage supplies and two data wires.
