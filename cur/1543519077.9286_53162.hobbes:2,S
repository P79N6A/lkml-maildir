I'd first get the per-file semaphore, then the big kernel lock: you cannot
dead-lock, and the big kernel lock is more important.
But if you start to fix the lock_kernel calls, could you also fix
sys_lseek() [same fix as above], sys_pread(), sys_pwrite() [can run without
the kernel lock], sys_readv()/sys_writev() [everything except
sock_readv_writev() can run without the kernel lock], old_mmap [in
arch/i386/kernel/sys_i386.c, just reorder fget() and lock_kernel()]
