I employed a variant of your patch (added a static i815_dev
to support my i815 chipset). It didn't help, X hung on resume.
PCI IDs of i815 are 0x1130, 0x1131, 0x1132.
I'm having 0x1130 and 0x1131, IOW an i815 system in
"external AGP graphics" mode:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82815 815 Chipset Host Bridge and Memory Controller Hub (rev 02)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82815 815 Chipset AGP Bridge (rev 02)
so I need to query 0x1131 instead of PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82815_CGC
(0x1132) for resume of the proper device, right??
Or am I supposed to restore the PCI space of my *non-builtin*
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Rage Mobility M4 AGP
card instead?
The diff below (against 2.6.19-ck2 or in fact plain 2.6.19)
shows what I changed from my (working!) version to what I think I
had to do to be compatible with your intentions. OK, not quite,
I now merely disabled the suspend/restore of the full PCI space,
several other parts remained the same.
IOW, suspending/restoring the *full* PCI space of my Host Bridge
helped, whereas restoring the standard PCI space of my Host Bridge
plus restoring the PCI space of the AGP bridge as you suggested
did NOT.
Can we conclude from that that I'm having rather different issues
than you?
I think this means that we are required/supposed to backup
the entire PCI space of host bridges, right? How to actually implement
this cleanly? Oh, and of course my patch manages to fix the X11
lockup only, actual video is still garbled and requires
vbetool magic to get it fixed, too...
Thanks,
Andreas Mohr
