Just plug in the new disk, boot the system, fdisk, create filesystems, 
copy data / restore data,  and that's it.
You only need to compile a kernel if you are plugging in some hardware
that is not supported by your running kernel.  Given that you run a
standard RedHat kernel, it should have support for just about everything
(and a kitchen sink).
You may find sfdisk useful for creating the partition tables (man sfdisk),
or you can create them "manually" using fdisk.
