		Hi to all!
	Nowadays there is an increased number of network cards which only
receive data - DVB-MPEG sattelite encapsulation of IP packets (which I
use), DirecPC, etc. Isn't there anything that should be adjusted in the
linux kernel so that it knows that some cards are receive (or maybe send)
only? So that /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter doesn't warn you if it
receives packets from that iface when the default route is through a
normal interface? Or maybe some other things, I don't know, but I feel
like they (the receive only ifaces) should be treated a little
differently.
		Thank you for your patience,
			Iustin Pop
