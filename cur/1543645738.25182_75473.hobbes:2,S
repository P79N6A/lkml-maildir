Um, usually being CPU bound is easier to fix.  We have probably not CPU 
profiled this code path, and after Halloween we probably should (but for 
reiser4, since reiser3 is soon to be obsoleted).  It is being IO bound 
that is usually hard to fix, though since I haven't read the htree code 
I trust you that it is different in this case....
