I was assuming the hibernation image was not encrypted.
Certainly if it meant a penalty during normal operation (e.g. encrypted swap)
it wouldn't be.
(I have a small amount of encrypted data in a luks partition,
most of the time it isn't used, only rarely do apps have it open
and I'm not actually worried about crawling through swap to find out
what is there - this is just a personal laptop; I appreciate these
concerns are different depending what you are storing).
