task_struct's mm member, of type mm_struct has the members arg_start
and arg_end, from which you can get the arguments.
task_struct's start_time should help for elaped time, unless you want
the user time and/or system time; for those use the per_cpu_utime[]
and per_cpu_stime[] arrays.  
for the username and groupname, you'll have to settle for uid and gid
(uid, euid, suid, fsuid, gid, egid, sgid and fsgid are all in
task_struct).
for the tty, use the struct tty_struct tty member of task_struct.  It
looks like tty_name(current->tty,buf) will put the tty's name into the
buffer buf.
Also cf <linux/elfcore.h> and linux/fs/binfmt_elf.c.
From the latter, CT_TO_SECS(current->times.tms_utime) and
CT_TO_USECS(current->times.tms_utime) give the seconds and useconds of
the user time; the same works for stime, cutime and cstime (c for
cumulative, I presume).
Also from there, use copy_from_user to copy (current->mm->arg_end -
current->mm->arg_start) octets from (const char *)
current->mm->arg_start to get at the arguments.
