My System:
Pentium III 800MHz
128M SDRAM
Aug 2001 MSC Linux
XFS File System
My Results:
hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 3739/255/63, sectors = 60074784, start = 0
hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.71 seconds = 23.62 MB/sec
time cp -r /usr/src/linux-2.4.6 tst
real 0m47.376s
user 0m0.180s
sys 0m2.710s
du -bs tst
144187392 tst
Actual Performance
2*144MB/48s=6MB/sec
Notes:
1) for consistent results; data size should exceed file cache.
2) cp reads and writes files: so 2*3MB/sec = 6MB/sec fileio on a 24MB/sec
drive
My Questions:
Is there a way of identifying what the file system is doing here?
Is there a way to improve it?
What tools are there to identify and time the raw disk io done by the file
system?
