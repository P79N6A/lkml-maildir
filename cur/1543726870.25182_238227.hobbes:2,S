Whip me, beat me, make me clean up drivers/char/drm

Seriously, it's not a fun job at all, so finding volunteers may be
somewhat difficult, but for someone with a high pain threshold, it might
be fun[1], but as Ian mentioned, it depends on the payoff.  If subsequent
DRI tree -> kernel merges back out any cleanup work, it's definitly going
to be a waste of time even trying.
Additionally, assuming some grand cleanup happens. Going back the other way
(keeping stuff in the DRI tree up to date with whatever kernel changes were
 made) is going to prove interesting. In short, I'd not expect other OS's to
work out-of-the-box until someone put in the legwork to make them adapt
to whatever changes were made.
Another possibility of course is that the BSD & Linux kernel side bits
go their seperate ways. How active is the kernel side of the BSD world ?

[1] Well, fun perhaps for the same sort of person who enjoyed pulling legs
    off of insects as a child, to see if it still wiggles.
