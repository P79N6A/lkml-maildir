Well you have the right WebSite.  There is also a mailing list devoted to
Linux on Thinkpads.
email to majordomo@www.bm-soft.com with a body of "subscribe linux-thinkpad"
As you probably know from the Web site Keith Frechette <kfrechet@hotmail.com>
is probably the best bet for getting native linux MWAVE loaders.  I would
directly email him with your offer for help.
