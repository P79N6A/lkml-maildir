Actually this was an attempt to fix the endianness issue pointed out in an 
earlier review by Ben Dooks, have I done it wrong?

Here's why (from include/linux/leds.h):
	/* Set LED brightness level */
	/* Must not sleep, use a workqueue if needed */
	void		(*brightness_set)(struct led_classdev *led_cdev,
					  enum led_brightness brightness);

This seems to be a common "feature" of multiple leds drivers. In fact, if 
the two calls are successive, then the queue will take care of the 
execution order. If they are "simultaneous," i.e., the callers didn't 
synchronise, how do we know who is the first and who is the second? Isn't 
the one that _completes_ first actually the first? Or am I missing 
something?
Thanks for the review!
