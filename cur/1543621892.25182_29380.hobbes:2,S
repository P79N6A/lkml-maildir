One nitpick ;-)
The IA-64 architecture does not limit the number of parallel
instructions.  I believe IPF (current Itanium) has a limit of 2 bundles
per instruction group, and with 3 instructions per bundle, that gives a
max of 6 parallel instructions.  This can change in the future, though.
I learned this in (no, he isn't paying me!) David's IA-64 Kernel book.
