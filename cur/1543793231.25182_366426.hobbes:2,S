Yes, it was a quick hack when akpm said that he'd like a page tracking
mechanism. I said myself that I thought it was too ugly to go into
mainline. Later I tried to make it some kind of generic framework that
all arches could use but there was no interest.
If you wish to make it nicer/mergeable it's all yours.
