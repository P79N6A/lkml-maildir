Hi all,
We're seeing the following on startup:
Fusion MPT base driver 3.02.55
Copyright (c) 1999-2005 LSI Logic Corporation
Fusion MPT SAS Host driver 3.02.55
mptbase: Initiating ioc0 bringup
mptbase: ioc0: WARNING - IOC is in FAULT state!!!
            FAULT code = 1804h
mptbase: ioc0: ERROR - Failed to come READY after reset! IocState=0
mptbase: ioc0 NOT READY WARNING!
mptbase: WARNING - ioc0 did not initialize properly! (-1)
mptsas: probe of 0000:05:01.0 failed with error -1
Is this a disk fault or a host fault?  Can anyone identify what the 
specific fault code means, or point me to a suitable resource?
Thanks,
Chris
