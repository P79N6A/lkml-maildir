It's even worse with RLIMIT_CPU. Imagine a process forks
RLIMIT_NPROC-1 child processes. These consume all their CPU time, get
killed with SIGXCPU, and the parent process spawns new child processes
again with fresh RLIMIT_CPU counters (the parent process idled
meanwhile, consuming none of its assigned CPU cycles). Again and
again.
You see, RLIMIT_CPU is worthless in its current implementation.
