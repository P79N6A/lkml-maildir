"There's a crowd of users running Linux on TCP offload capable
cards, and they need TCP offload support in Linux."
The people who need a LE network driver can use Christian's driver,
as Christian's driver works in LE just fine.  The people who care
about LE support can add LE support to the driver that Krzysztof wrote.
I don't think that not supporting LE is a reason not to merge
Krzysztof's driver.  Don't make supporting LE systems Krzysztof's
problem.
Krzysztof has written an excellent driver, and while it would be 100%
Debian style to reject his driver just because it doesn't support LE[*],
thankfully, Linux is not Debian.  Please don't turn Linux into Debian.
[*] And if he were to complain about this, he would get slapped with
    the standard "Our priorities are our users and free software"
    Debian Social Contract rhetoric -- thank $DEITY we don't have a
    Linux Kernel Social Contract with the same bullshit in it.
