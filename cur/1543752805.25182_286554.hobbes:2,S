Just a few things from a quick look;
- What's with all the ltt_*_bit? Please use the ones provided by the 
kernel.
- i see cpu_has_tsc, can't you use sched_clock?
- ltt_log_event isn't preempt safe
- num_cpus isn't hotplug cpu safe, and you should be using the 
for_each_online_cpu iterators
- code style, you have large hunks of code with blocks of the following 
form, you can save processor cycles by placing an if (incoming_process) 
branch earlier. This code is in _ltt_log_event, which i presume executes 
frequently.
if (event_id == LTT_EV_SCHEDCHANGE)
	incoming_process = (struct task_struct *) ((ltt_schedchange *) event_struct)->in);
if ((trace->tracing_gid == 1) && (current->egid != trace->traced_gid)) {
	if (incoming_process == NULL)
		return 0;
	else if (incoming_process->egid != trace->traced_gid)
		return 0;
}
... [ more of the same ]
if ((trace->tracing_uid == 1) && (current->euid != trace->traced_uid)) {
	if (incoming_process == NULL)
		return 0;
	else if (incoming_process->euid != trace->traced_uid)
		return 0;
}
