It could be done with a simple dosemu trick I think. Back to
dosemu-0.66.7, I could run Warcraft 2 under dosemu, which initiates a
non-standard 640x480x256 video mode. Most vendors have some msdos tsr
program on their website, that would run on dosemu+freedos, provided
access to the video card ports is granted via the dosemu.conf.
If I find some time, I'll try it. Could be fun.
Moreover, both FreeBSD and Minix386 can access bios functions with vm86.
This shows that it can be done under Linux (although a REAL solution
should always be preferred).
