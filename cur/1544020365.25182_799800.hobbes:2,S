Wrong!! Sorry, you guys don't listen.
I'm talking of the case where the structures are EXACTLY the same anyway
you look at them. sizeof(foo) == sizeof(foo_packed) and 
offsetof(foo_memmber) == offsetof(foo_packed_member) for every member of
the structure. foo && foo_packed are declared exactly the same but with
__attribute__((packed(1))) applied to the later.
THEN in ia64 case the compiler is brain dead, because it relates
"unalignment" to packed(1) which are two different things.

Lets make a small test is: sizeof(orig_struct) == sizeof(my_struct)?
offsetof(orig_any_memmber) == offsetof(my_any_memmber)?
Yes because the padding is there if you shove it under the rug or expose
it.
What I'm saying is don't repeat the passed mistakes, spell out the exact
structure layout. So it will compile the same for any <= 64bit machine.
If the way a structure was defined in the passed, produced two or more
memory representations, spell these out with different structure
definitions and choose the one you need at compile time.
Otherwise you have fixed nothing. You are just repeating the same
passed mistake. And down the future some programmer will wish he add
a time machine to go back and fix what we've done today. But bingo, he
did and told me about it, and now it is time to fix that.

Don't let the compiler have the driver's sit. You do the driving, because
he does not know where you want to go.
