   Here's a patchset to enable networking mibs to use kmalloc_percpu instead
   of the traditional padded NR_CPUS arrays.
   Advantages:
   1. Removes NR_CPUS bloat due to static definition
   2. Can support node local allocation
   3. Will work with modules
I totally support this work.  Once the kmalloc percpu bits hit
Linus's tree, just retransmit these diffs to me privately and
I'll put them into my net-2.5 tree.
Thanks.
