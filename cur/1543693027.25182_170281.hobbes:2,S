Argh! This bit was in the previous patch I applied. Please get it 
straight, or just keep adding to one patch and resending it (with an 
itemized list of changes).

It's technically still incorrect, since you'd still be leaking memory if
suspend failed. And, the comment is still in an unfortunate place.  
Something like this, before the function helps to provide understanding of 
the entire operation:
/**
 *	write_suspend_image - Write entire image to disk. 
 *
 * 	...
 *
 *	Note: The buffer we allocate to use to write the suspend header is 
 *	not freed because it otherwise causes a random Oops that I can't 
 *	find. This is a band-aid that probably only masks the problem, and 
 *	technically bad, since it means we leak memory unconditionally if 
 *	suspend fails.
