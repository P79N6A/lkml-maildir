i think using nice for both cpu share and latency is broken by design ...
a typical use case on my system: for real-time tv recording i need
mencoder to get some 80% of the cpu time on average. that means i have
to nice -<something "big"> it to prevent compiles, flash plugins running
amok, etc. from making mencoder explode (i.e., overrun buffers). but that
entirely destroys interactivity; in fact the desktop becomes basically
unusable.
