If USB mice had serial numbers (like some USB storage devices
do), then we could tell that it's the same mouse on the
same connector and not change from mouse0 to mouse1.
Currently it looks like a new device attachment.
One possible solution is for you to use /dev/usb/mice,
which is all USB mice merged into one input stream.
