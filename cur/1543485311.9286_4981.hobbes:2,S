It has been my experience too that often the deleting of large files takes a
long time & is uninterruptable - but not always.
Today I was downloading some large ftp files 220MB, I had reason to kill the
remote ftp session
when I tried to remove the local files the prompt returned immediately  -
unusual, when I removed the second same behaviour.
then I looked at a process list the killed ftp sessions had some kind of
lock on the file, when I killed these local sessions the files started to be
deleted.
running 2.0.35, redhat 5.1
