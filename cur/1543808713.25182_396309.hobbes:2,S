    Yeah, I sorta figured that.  Is there any easier way to
remove the recursion?  I dunno about you, but I was always taught
that recursion, while elegant, was not always the most efficient in
terms of time and space requirements and one could get similar
functionality using iteration and a stack.
    The GNU libraries _seem_ to indicate a max of 20 links supported
there.  Googling around, I see I'm not the first person to be surprised
by the low limit.  I don't recall running into such a limit on any
other Unixes, though I'm sure they had some limit.
    It can be useful for creating a shadow file-system where only
root needs to point to a "target source", and the "symlink" overlay
lies over the top of any real, underlying file.
    Why can't things just be easy sometimes...:-/
