thanks for letting us know, you might have catched a very important bug.
We've introduced a number of changes (x_tables) that haven't received
testing on all architectures yet.
I will try to reproduce the bug on my debian ppc box here.
This is not meant as a fix, but you might try it to narrow down the
problem:  Try recompiling iptables on your own, and report back whether
that works or not.
