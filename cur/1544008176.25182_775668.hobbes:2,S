I'm not seeing how this could matter. In the latter one, we apparently 
don't set up any PCI bus memory window, but I bet it's a transparent 
bridge, and it shouldn't matter. IOW, your dmesg probably has a line like 
this somewhere:
	pci 0000:00:1e.0: transparent bridge
and whether there is an explicit bus window or not is simply immaterial.
That said, if you can show the differences in dmesg from the two cases, it 
would probably be interesting to see why it happens that way.  Why did we 
bother setting up that PCI bus window in -rc3 at all? Was it there from 
the beginning?

There were some HDA fixes recently, although I don't think they should 
matter for suspend/resume (well, at least a couple of them should fix the 
case of sound being _silent_ on resume, but shouldn't have caused any 
other issues).
