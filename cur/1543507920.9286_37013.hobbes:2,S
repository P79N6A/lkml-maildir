Well, I've been dropping snapshots at 
ftp://ftp.zytor.com/pub/linux/,
but it doesn't actually do anything useful yet.  It will be officially
released when it works and is stable.  The first release will probably
just boot the current zImage/bzImage; the architecture of the boot
loader is such that it will be really easy to add new features (except
for the really early bootstraps and some support code, it's all 32-bit
gcc-compiled C code.)
I just pulled an all-nighter trying to find ways to work around CD-ROM
BIOS bugs... but now I think I've gotten it to work reliably, even on
a few buggy BIOSes...
