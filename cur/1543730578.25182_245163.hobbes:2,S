An idea:  To really put some pressure on vendors, also have an entry for
"alternate/better solution" where people can list a way to achieve the
same result with someone else's product and open drivers.  Example:
Product: Matrox parhelia  (a triplehead graphichs card)
Reason: Bad binary-only 2D-only driver
Alternate solution: Achieve triplehead with two radeon cards (1 AGP 
dualhead + 1 PCI) instead!
This will be useful for anyone planning a upgrade but finding their 
favourite
solution on the incompatibility list.  And it'll sure put some pressure 
on the manufacturer
to at least get a _good_ driver out (changing the reason), or even 
better, an open one
which get rid of the incompatibility entry.
