Ok, so somehow it is leaking.  I have a system in the lab that is the same
hardware as production, but it currently has no, you know, hard drives in
it, so some assembly is required.  I'll see if I can reproduce it in a test
environment and then see if I can get more information on when/where it is
leaking.

Yes, I saw that.  I didn't fully understand it, but I saw it.
Thanks,
Sean
