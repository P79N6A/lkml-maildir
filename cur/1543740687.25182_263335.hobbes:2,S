(thinks as quality fine,normal,low). I can't provide with v4l2 a generic

The driver, in it's current status, is GPL. Can you give me some examples
about "other drivers" ?

It's easy for you to say that, because your driver returns a native format.
Since nobody cares about webcam, and stream compressed, if today, i remove
the table in the module, i'll wait one year ? two years for app that support
my webcam ?

my driver only output a standart video stream, i don't convert colorspace.
Decompression ops use table and offset in this table. The one thing i agree
about decompression, is for kernel preemption.

And it's logic too, to let the driver do the decompression because you WANT
your device working. So please, i want to remove decompression, but i want
people be able to use camera. People have trouble to compile the module
outside of the kernel (and you just need to type make; make install). If you
need to compile, gnomeeting, kame, kde, xawtv yourself to use the camera,
i'll not able to take time to add features on this drivers.
