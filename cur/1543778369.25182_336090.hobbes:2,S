You are trying to unmount a /dev/hdc? hdc is an IDE Hard Drive, you have 
a CD burner, I would doubt that it is /de/hdc.
type mount and that will tell you what is mounted, try umount 
/dev/cdrom. You need the hardware unloaded.
Try /etc/init.d/hotplug stop and unplugg the hardware. See if that hangs 
the PC.
Figure out on how to unload the module, then you will need to get us 
more info here for this problem to be looked...
anyone has more suggestions?
