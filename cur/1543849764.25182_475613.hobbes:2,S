And again I can reporduce it. How, (again, please don't lough):
I booted into windows (sometimes one has too, contract from the EC with
macros in Excel tables ... grrr).
WinXP didn't mange to get an IP address from my cable modem.
Rebooting into linux, same problem as reported, 
and, but no idea whether this is related: the modem just looses sync and
need several resets until it find back into syncronization.
I will do some more experiments with Win-different linux kernel
switching.
Sorry for the chaos, no idea what has happened here!!!
Best wishes
Norbert

`Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,'
insisted the girl, `Do people want fire that can be fitted
nasally?'
