With that patch sched_init gives an early exception. I don't think
we can fix up all cases before 2.6.16, but it's dangerous
to let it reference freed memory.
I think the best course of action for this now for 2.6.16 is:
- mark percpu init data not __init
(this way it will still reference valid memory, although shared between
all impossible CPUs)
- keep the impossible CPUs per cpu data to point to the original reference  
version (== offset 0)
For 2.6.17 all the occurrences of NR_CPUS should be audited
and fixed up like you started in your earlier patch.
Like the attached patch.

Let impossible CPUs point to reference per cpu data
Hack for 2.6.16. In 2.6.17 all code that uses NR_CPUs should
be audited and changed to only touch possible CPUs.
Don't mark the reference per cpu data init data (so it stays
around after boot) and point all impossible CPUs to it. This way
they reference some valid - although shared memory. Usually
this is only initialization like INIT_LIST_HEADs and there
won't be races because these CPUs never run. Still somewhat hackish.
