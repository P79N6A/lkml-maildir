Hi folks,
I'm looking for a timer resolution lower than 1 ms (and monotonic clock 
rate) destined to be used with some network code running on x86 
platforms. Would you please provide me with informations about how to 
get/implement this.
AFAIK, there's a "high resultion timer" patch hanging around, but 
there's not much informations with regard to portability (specific 
hardware requirements ?), scalability, integration with RT patches.
I understand the POSIX 1003.1b Clocks and Timers system calls are not 
fully available within the linux kernel (and libc ?), am I right on that ?
One more question : I believe Ingo's preemption patch run 
timers/interrupt handlers within kernel threads, how should I assign 
specific priority to address my goals without compromising system 
stability ?
