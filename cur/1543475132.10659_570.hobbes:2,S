Hi all,
	I am not a current emeber of this list so could you cc answers to me
(gtm@oracom.com).  Thank you.
I am trying to load linux 2.0.35 on to a DEC Personal Workstation 300i. 
The load goes fine (I am using S.U.S.E 5.3) but when I finish and try to
boot from the drive LILO hangs at LI.  I have read a lot about why that
happens and nothing seems to work.  I have added the disk geometry into
lilo.conf and reran lilo. I did this in the global section with DISK=
and HEADS= SECTORS= CYLINDERS=.  When I do this I get L 04 04
(continuing for ever) and when I have no geometry it hangs at LI.  This
is a 4 gig Western Digital EIDE drive.  Any advice would be great.  
			Thank you all
				Glenn
