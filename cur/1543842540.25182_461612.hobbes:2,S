So in this case the assertion is satisfied because x == 1.  My question
was whether the assertion could ever fail.  Paul said that it could, but I
didn't find his reason convincing.

I'm not sure what you mean.  The code wasn't intended to "work" in any 
sense; it was just to make a point.  My question still stands: Is it 
possible, in the code as I originally wrote it, for the assertion to fail?
