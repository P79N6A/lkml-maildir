Consider using .73 :)

Well, does it _really_ hang or are you able to ping that machine from another 
machine? Your error looks like the 8435989 times discussed misconfiguration 
;)
CONFIG_INPUT=y
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
Make sure you have the above set in your .config
Or, to speak in menuconfig language:
Input device support ->
 [*] Input devices (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...)
Character devices ->
 [*] Virtual terminal
    [*] Support for console on virtual terminal
