Subject: sched.h changes in 2.4.19rc5aa1 / Digi's cpci driver doesn't compile

Hello!
I'm using Linux 2.4.19rc5aa1 and having problems to compile Digi's cpci
driver for multiport serialboard. This driver is not part of the kernel,
but available from Digi's website.
The problem seems to be related to changes in include/linux/sched.h.
Digi's driver wants to use member called "counter" which doesn't exist
anymore in the -aa kernel.
The code goes like this (cpci.c line 3847):
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	current->counter = 0;   /* make us low-priority */
current is task_struct.

Any ideas how to fix this? I'm not familiar with kernel driver
development..
