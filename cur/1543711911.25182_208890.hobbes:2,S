Error messages should be handled on a seperate VT eliminating the issue.

I'll do more testing there in due course.
How are bad blocks on a swap partition handled by the vm?

Which reminds me of the "failed to read a chunk" message, the guys who reported
it got all quiet after telling them to do more badblocks testing without diskcaching or
using dd to write random data and read them back, so  likely was caused by
media problems.
Here we need more detailed error messages including the driver output  and the
screen  should be switched to a text VT so messages are visible. Also as the
error will cause resume to fail the system should be halted in this case.
IMO seperate message VT will eliminate all interference issues and further modularization
by keeping the eye candy seperate.
