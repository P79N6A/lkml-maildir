Your argument has a built-in assumption that, whereas syscall numbers do
collide, syscall names will not. This assumption is not true; people
will quite often pick the same name for something independent of each
other.
Additionally, the proposed solutions will require a dramatic increase in
memory, to store a static string name for each syscall, and a marked
increase in CPU usage, to do string hashing and matching for each
syscall invocation (and these can occur very often). This overhead is
hard to justify just to support custom vendor kernels, as Rene pointed
out in a separate reply.

I thought that this file was "shipped upwards" by the kernel already, as
a sanitized header?
