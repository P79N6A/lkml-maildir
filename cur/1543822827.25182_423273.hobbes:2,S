Subject: Linux kernel 2.6.16.14 boot errors: udevd-event: udev_make_node and find_free_number
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

My 2.6.15.4 booted without any errors or warnings. Now with 2.6.16.14 I
get the below errors. I have also installed 2.6.16.14 on another
computer, and it works great there. I stepped through every kernel
config option and everything is in place.
Any ideas? All suggestions appreciated.
Gentoo, gcc 3.4.4-r1, P4-1.5GHz, 512MB RAM, hp pavilion 7955.
