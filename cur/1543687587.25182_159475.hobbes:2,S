this address took ages to resolve here. Since 65.200.24.183 is "mail.kroah.com",
I suspect, that Greg's DNS timed out and returned something it new for an
unknown reason. So Greg was looking for your file on his server :-)
This reminds me of the old joke of creating warez.<your_domain> which points to
127.0.0.1, then you advertise for it in newsgroups and have people reply
"I already have them all" :-)
Cheers,
Willy
