Maybe I was just thinking the wrong way. Given that my systems don't
use IDE, SCSI, a floppy or anything emulating one of them, like USB
storage or CF. I don't want MSDOS partitioning, but in fact, I don't
want any of the disk-centric code at all, fs/partitions is just a part
of that.
Then the real fix would be to have (no disk stuff) => (some magic) =>
(no MSDOS partitions,...).
My proposition for (some magic) would be to add an option for having
disks (or floppies, emulating stuff, yadda, yadda...) and have some
things like partitioning depend on that option. I better sharpen my
claymore to cut through all that code then.
