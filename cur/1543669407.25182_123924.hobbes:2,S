This tells me two things:
1) You don't trust maintainers.  If a maintainer can't make large changes,
   who can?
2) When a maintainer makes a mistake (fails to integrate a good change,
   or introduces a bug), the maintainers changes are simply dropped rather
   then notify (either politely or not I don't much care) the maintainer
   of his/her mistake.
Neither of the above applied to integration of the aic79xx driver into
the 2.4.X tree, but it still took something like 8 months.
There must be a better way.
