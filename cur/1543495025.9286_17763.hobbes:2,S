Hi,
You might already know this, but if not it could be useful.  Stepan
Reinauer has been maintaining and updating his /dev/bios module (the
interface is a character device file) which can read and write the flash
BIOS in most PC's and Alpha's, and even PCI cards (like video and SCSI
adapters).  I've used it quite successfully. :-)

BTW if the latest version available on the website Oops's in 2.2.6, let me
know and I'll send you a diff that fixes it.  Stepan already fixed the
problem internally but may not have had time to update the web page.
