The problem with this is that by the time we _do_ determine that a
reschedule is needed, we might have built up a huge amount of work
to do (which can probably be as much if not more exensive per-page
as the unmapping), so scheduling latency can still be unacceptable
so I'm afraid I don't think we can include this patch.
One option I've been looking into is my "mmu gather in-place" that
never needs extra tlb flushes and is always preemptible... so that
may be a way forward.
