| OPEN - A new bug that no one is working on.  Bugs in this state may
| be accepted, and become ASSIGNED. The default owner (in charge of tracking
| the bug) is the subsystem maintainer or the bugme-janitors mailing list.
Do new bugs go straight to OPEN with a default owner?
Where does someone sign up for this new mailing list?
