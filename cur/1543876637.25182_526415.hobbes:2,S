F.e. you are wasting memory that the slab needs to uselessly track these 
allocations. You would need to create a special slab that has page sized
(or huge page sized) alignment to have the proper allocation behavior. Not 
good.
The rest of sparse is not MMU bound. So you may be fine. I'd recommend 
though to use the page allocator if you are doing large allocations. I do 
not see the point of using slab there.

If I would be doing that then we would end up adding these pagetable walks
to multiple architectures. I already need to cover IA64 and x86_64 and 
this will also do i386. Lets try to keep them generic. PPC may need to 
disable these walks and do its own thing.

What is the purpose of alloc_remap? Could not figure that one out.
