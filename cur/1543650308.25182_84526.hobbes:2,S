I tried to modify the mtasker webserver
(
http://ds9a.nl/mtasker/releases/mtasker-0.2.tar.gz
) to work with epoll
instead of select and, well, this is awkward.
The right way to use epoll is (schematically);
	int clientfd=accept();
	setnonblocking(clientfd);
	epfd=epoll_create();
	epoll_ctl(epfd,EP_CTL_ADD, clientfd, POLLIN);
	for(;;) {
		if(read(clientfd)<0 && errno==EAGAIN) {
			epoll_wait(epfd);
			continue;
		}
                epoll_ctl(epfd,EP_CTL_DEL, clientfd); // remove again
		break;
	}
This requires having the fd in epoll before trying to read, which means a
weird interface where you have to register your interest, try to read, and
unregister your interface in case it succeeded.
	
This means two epoll syscalls per read.
This is all solved if epoll_ctl() creates an edge if it finds that the poll
condition is met at insert time.	
The way it works now is way more awkward then using regular poll(), the way
it works now is very easy to do wrong because of this awkwardness. Even
semi-correct which zeroes the pollstate before calling epoll is wrong:
	for(;;) {
		if(read(clientfd)<0 && errno==EAGAIN) {
			waitOn(clientfd);  /* function which registers our
                                              interest with a central
			                      dispatcher and waits */ 
			continue;
		}
		break;
	}
	
Code like this would appear in many userspace threading abstractions, like
GNU Pth or mtasker. Instead, we need:
	for(;;) {
		registerReadInterest(clientfd);
		if(read(clientfd)<0 && errno==EAGAIN) {
			waitOn(clientfd);  /* function which waits for our
			                      interest be satisfied */
			continue;
		}
		deleteReadInterest(clientfd);
		break;
	}
If epoll_ctl make epoll_wait report an edge in case it finds that there is
already data, all this is way way simpler, allowing:
	waitOn(clientfd); /* function which registers interest and waits for
	                     an edge to appear */
	read(clientfd);
