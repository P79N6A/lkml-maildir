I already answered this. That hard swappiness patch does not really 
rewrite swapping policy. It identifies exactly what has changed because 
it does not count "distress in the swap tendency". Therefore if the 
swappiness value is the same, the mapped ratio is the same (in the 
workload) yet the vm is swappinig more, it is getting into more 
"distress". The mapped ratio is the same but the "distress" is for some 
reason much higher in later kernels, meaning the priority of our 
scanning is getting more and more intense. This should help direct your 
searches.
These are the relevant lines of code _from mainline_:
distress = 100 >> zone->prev_priority
mapped_ratio = (sc->nr_mapped * 100) / total_memory;
swap_tendency = mapped_ratio / 2 + distress + vm_swappiness
if (swap_tendency >= 100)
-		reclaim_mapped = 1;
That hard swappiness patch effectively made "distress == 0" always.
