Well, this is the principle of Estoppel, I believe.  To prevail on
estoppel, the distribution must have been deliberate, not inadvertent.
The v3 language also pulls in inadvertent distribution.

So we agree that the statement is true for a company that has only a
software patent portfolio.

No, the point being made is that under v2, as long as the company was
only distributing, it didn't have to go over its patent portfolio
comparing it against the functions in the code on the website.  It would
still be able to sue for a patent infringement in code as long as it
didn't deliberately mislead people into using that code.

Actually, HP had no input at all into the statement we made, so I would
be very surprised if the same words were used.
