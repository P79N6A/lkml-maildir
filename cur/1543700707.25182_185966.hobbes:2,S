Oh, really?  That "flame in public" was after _many_ months of pointing
to the same problems in private - with zero effect.
If maintainer sits on exploitable holes for ~18 months and does not care to do
anything, his code is unmaintained.  If same maintainer keeps pretending in
public that everything is fine, he can expect to have the truthfulness of his
statements challenged.  Also in public.  If the situation persists even after
that, then yes, there will be rather unflattering things to say.
Don't delude yourself - critical parts of devfs had not been maintained for
quite a while before Richard had disappeared.  It's not the effect of flames
- it's their cause and it predates them by _far_.
