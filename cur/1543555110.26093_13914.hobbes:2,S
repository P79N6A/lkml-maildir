I'm using 2.4.0-test11pre7
I calcute md5sum of some files in a ext2 partition. I move those files
to a vfat partition. I duplicate the directory im the vfat partition. The
duplicate set doesn't pass the md5sum.
I have done various test and I can replicate they don't pass the md5 sum.
Are there some problem with the vfat code :?. Some problem with my hardware
:?. I have no overclocked hardware nor using dma on disks ( only multicount).
Saludos
