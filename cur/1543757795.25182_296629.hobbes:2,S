my colleage has found the bug: in the function dma_mmap in 
arch/arm/mm/consistent.c the call to remap_pfn_range uses 
user_size in PAGE_SIZE units, but looks like it is expected 
in bytes. When using (user_size << PAGE_SHIFT), it works.
I don't know, where to fix it: Should the lower level calls 
get the size in bytes (most function arguments in Linux 
kernel sources are not commented), this means fixing the 
dma_mmap, or should PAGE_SIZE be used, then the lower level 
functions needs to be fixed.
