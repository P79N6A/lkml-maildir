Hi Guys,
I have missed all the original emails in this thread. I was trying to 
re-subscribe to the lkml a few days ago (I just switched over to 
Thunderbird) but I haven't been getting any traffic. So I will try again.
The one thing I can say is that having worked extensively with ATI 
cards, there are some registers that have an effect on whether the BIOS 
image shows up on at the ROM BAR address or not. To get all the ATI 
cards we have working, we have had to massage some of those registers 
because after the POST has been run, they will cause the BIOS image to 
disappear (not intentionally on ATI's part, but a side effect I think).
Note that the cards that require this work just fine if they are in a 
cold boot state when you run the POST - they only have issues after the 
POST code has been run (which actually affects X drivers trying to read 
the BIOS PLL information too).
So perhaps this problem is something similar?
Regards,
