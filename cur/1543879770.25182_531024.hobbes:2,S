Well, this means i8042 can be ruled out, so the problem probably is related
to the ACPI resume which makes it _much_ more difficult to debug.
Can you compile the ACPI drivers: processor, thermal, fan, battery, etc. as
modules, boot the kernel with init=/bin/bash and see if the problem is still
present (please keep CONFIG_SERIO_I8042 unset just in case)?
