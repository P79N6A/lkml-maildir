No reason. From user-space, using mmap, you can read the screen-memory
at 0xb8000, for instance, ........
-d b8000
000B8000  63 09 64 09 72 09 6F 09-6D 09 20 07 20 07 20 07   c.d.r.o.m. . . .
000B8010  20 07 20 07 20 07 20 07-20 07 20 07 20 07 20 07    . . . . . . . .

You can look access many kernel areas that way. The probem is:
(1) When are new data available, and how much.
(2) How do you keep it from being overwritten by the next interrupt
    before it's been read.
These, and other, problems are why there are 'standard' ways of doing
things.
Cheers,
