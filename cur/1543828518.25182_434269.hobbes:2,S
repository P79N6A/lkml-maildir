Wrong.
Why do you think we go to the bother of installing a double fault handler if
we're going to reset? Why would we go to the bother of printk'ing
information about the double fault if we're about to reset faster than
it would get to a serial console ?
The box intentionally locks up, so we have a chance to know wtf happened.

Wrong.

Your single datapoint is just that, a single datapoint.
There are a number of reported cases of CPUs frying themselves.
Here's one:

Google no doubt has more.
Another anecdote: Upon fan failure, I once had an athlon MP *completely shatter*
(as in broke in two pieces) under extreme heat.
This _does_ happen.

So you got lucky. I've blistered a thumb on hot CPUs before now
after fan failure.

Reality disagrees with you.

cpu_relax() and friends aren't going to save a box in light of
a fan failure in my experience.  
However for a box which has locked up (intentionally)
running instructions that do save power in a loop has obvious advantages.
