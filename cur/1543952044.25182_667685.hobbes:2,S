BTW, Since some filesystem always give DT_UNKNOWN an additional stat is
necessary to implement whiteout filtering. I don't want to do that in
kernel-space if possible ...

Which basically means tracking of the "space" between dirents and maintaining
the relative order of entries. Which is a pain. I already tried to solve this
problem for tmpfs before and it needs a hugh amount of kernel memory for open
directories. In the end I only know of one situation where it is used: very old
glibc when running 32bit applications on 64bit kernel.
