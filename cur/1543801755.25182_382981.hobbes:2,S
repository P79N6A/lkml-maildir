The old x.bz2 would be better please, because I'm going to have to do
fixups for various -mm-only things like dlm, asfs, reiser4, etc.

Is everything up to and including the mutex series.  That's a suitable
insertion point for new stuff.
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/everything.bz2
 is the whole
kit.  It includes additional things which'll need fixups if you're feeling
keen.
Sorry for the hassle - there are still great gobs of stuff to merge, and
we're basically twiddling thumbs until things like nfs, powerpc, usb get
merged.
