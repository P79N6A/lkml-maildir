Sorry for not answering, maybe I lost your mail , or did not notice you
question.
No update/bdflush was running on my 2.2.9 kernel.
I checked this first throug grepping for "update" or
"bdflush"  in the process list.
It seems that even if update was not much intelligent,
inserting shcedule() calls helps very much, we still are all waiting for
Mingo's latest killer patch.  :-)
When I get the patch and and the testresult I will post them.
ciao,
Benno.
