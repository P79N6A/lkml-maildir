yeah well sort of. You're right of course, but that also doesn't mean
you can't give hints from the other side. Like "data for this socked is
NOT critical important". It gets tricky if you only do it for OOM stuff;
because then that one ACK packet could cause a LOT of memory to be
freed, and as such can be important for the system even if the socket
isn't.
