    still group "SOCK_RAW" is subset of the PF_INET group (the way
    I see it), so from ip(7) man page I should use sockaddr_in
    structure, which should be defined in this particular case,
    as it ought be for IPPROTO_UDP.
have you dumped the packet contents? presumably its a raw packet,
protocol 6, and the header and such like is returned
i see no reason, for raw packets to fill out sin_port whatoever, it
just doesn't make sense that raw packets have a port
