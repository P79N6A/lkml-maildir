I gather then that there are really two separate problems:
	Handling an error somewhere in the middle of the medium, and
	Handling an error beyond the real end of the medium.
The mm and block subsystems have no way at all to retrieve partial data
for the first case.  Even though only one hardware sector may be bad,
failure to read an entire page means that none of the good sectors on that
page will be accessible.  While annoying, it's understandable and I don't 
see any simple way to accomodate such partial reads.
The second case appears to be more tractable, as you said.  In fact,
do_generic_mapping_read() in mm/filemap.c will recheck the inode's size
after a successful read, to avoid copying data beyond the end of the
device.
Could part of the problem also be that the set_capacity() call, used to
revise the device size downward when the CD driver realizes it is smaller
than originally thought, doesn't update the inode?  Should the driver call
bd_set_size() as well?  (In addition to completing the read successfully
with garbage data beyond the actual EOF.)
Incidentally, can you explain what bd_block_size in struct block_device is 
for?  Is the block_size used for anything important, that is, more 
important than the hardware sector size?  I ask because of the strange 
code in bd_set_size which sets bd_block_size equal to the largest power of 
2 that evenly divides the device size and is <= the PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.
