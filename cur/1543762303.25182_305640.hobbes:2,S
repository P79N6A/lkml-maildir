Hrm.  This is getting pretty lame, if you can't take patches from the 
-latest- stable release.  It's pretty easy in BK:
	bk clone -ql -rv2.6.11 linux-2.6 rng-2.6.11
	cd rng-2.6.11
	{ apply patch }
	bk pull ../linux-2.6
Can you set up something like that?

We already have a hardware RNG system.  This is completely unneeded.
