    That's what I supposed.

    I was just wondering if, apart from the excessive wear, there were
other reasons. One of the reasons I would like to use a good filesystem
for a pendrive is to be able to store file metadata (UID, GID, mode,
etc.) properly, for example to store a "live" copy of my home dir in the
pendrive.
    Thanks for your answer :)
