I would like to reorganize the Documentation directory, starting with the 
following:
  cd Documentation
  mkdir -p arch/amiga
  mv zorro.txt arch/amiga
  mv arm cris blackfin parisc powerpc s390 x86_64 uml arch
  mv sx.txt stallion.txt specialix.txt rocket.txt riscom8.txt \
     computone.txt hayes-esp.txt moxa-smartio serial
I could send a patch to do this, but moving files via patch is icky.  Would it 
be better to start a git tree and ask people to pull from it, or to send in 
script snippets like the above?
