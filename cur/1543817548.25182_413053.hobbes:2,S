user code in this context includes, in my interpretation, headers for
specific ioctl structures and such (eg direct included headers; headers
that those headers include are a different matter) that the user wants.
Which is the vast majority of the kernel abi.
Exceptions are things like __u64 which are almost always "indirectly"
included. Eg the app wants "struct foo_ioctl" and foo_ioctl happens to
contain an __u64 which needs types.h

the good news is that as kernel we have SOME power ;)
people who make compilers like that stay away from symbols the kernel
defines. Especially gcc is very careful in its namespace use and tends
to be very different from what linux kernel uses

First of all be realistic. Don't do silly things for places where it
doesn't matter. Again the ioctl structs come to mind.
Second, names the kernel ALREADY claims are of course free to use as
well; all those compilers ALREADY stay away from those.
What is left if you take those two big ones out of the picture?

there is another dynamic; those other compilers in general try to
emulate gcc to a large degree, usually a very large degree. So the
"problem" you see is a lot smaller than you think.
