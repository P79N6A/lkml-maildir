AFAICT The rw semaphore fastpath is similar in performance to a rw 
spinlock.

Overscheduling? You mean overhead?

On the other hand a semaphore puts the process to sleep and may actually 
improve performance because there is less time spend in a busy loop. 
Other processes may do something useful and we stay off the contended 
cacheline reducing traffic on the interconnect.

The question is why that is the case and it seesm that there are issues 
with interrupt on/off that are important here and particularly significant 
with the SLAB allocator (significant hacks there to deal with that issue). 
The fastpath that we have in the works for SLUB may address a large 
part of that issue because it no longer relies on disabling interrupts.
