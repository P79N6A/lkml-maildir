again, let me repeat the question: what's the purpose of this (whole!) 
patch. Not just of this chunk - the whole patch. You change around 
initcall levels - why? It makes no sense to me. The explanation in the 
patch header makes no sense to me.
Please if possible try to build clear arguments: first outlining "this 
is how it worked before: <X>", then outlining "this is how it will work 
after my change: <Y>", and then maybe a small blurb about "Y is better 
than X, because: <Z>". That X, Y, Z analysis is what is needed to accept 
a patch.

i think you misunderstood my comment. In the chunk above you used 
fs_initcall() initcall instead of clocksource_initcall(). (Which is 
funny even ignoring the bad hack that clocksource_initcall is defined to 
fs_initcall.)
