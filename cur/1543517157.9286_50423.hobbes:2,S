Caused by trying to build the kernel with an older binutils; are you using
the latest version recommended by Documentation/Changes?
[quote]
   You must use binutils 2.9.1.0.7 or later. Latest release is 2.9.1.0.25.
Beware that binutils 2.9.1 (note the absence of a suffix) from the FSF
does not work. If you are upgrading from earlier versions, you should
consider upgrading to the latest 2.9.5.0.x release.
