Except on the Alpha, and on some ARM systems, etc.
The HZ constant varies from 10 to 1200.

It is nice to have accurate per-process user/system accounting.
Since you'd be touching the code anyway...

This is a BIG can of worms. You have UTC, TAI, GMT, and a loosely
defined POSIX time that is none of the above. This is a horrid mess,
even ignoring gravity and speed. :-)
Can a second be 2 billion nanoseconds?
Can a nanosecond be twice as long as normal?
Can a second appear twice, with the nanoseconds getting reset?
Can a second never appear at all?
Can you compute times more than 6 months into the future?
How far does time deviate from solar time? Is this constrained?
If you deal with leap seconds, you have to have a table of them.
This table grows with time, with adjustments being made with only
about 6 months notice. So the user upgrades after a year or two,
and the installer discovers that the user has been running a
system that is unaware of the most recent leap second. Arrrgh.
Sure you want to touch this? The Austin group argued over it for
a very long time and never did find a really good solution.
Maybe you should just keep the code simple and fast, without any
concern for clock adjustments.

Within the kernel at least, it would be good to let drivers specify
desired resolution. Then a near-by value could be selected, perhaps
with some consideration for event type. (for cache reasons)
