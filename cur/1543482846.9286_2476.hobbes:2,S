The 2.2.0 kernel seems to be working OK (modulo certain APM and ESS
oddities, more below) but something strange is in /proc/interrupts.
I run PPP for my internet connection, over /dev/ttyS0.  setserial says:
----------------------------------
# setserial -a /dev/ttyS0
/dev/ttyS0, Line 0, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x03f8, IRQ: 4
        Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
        closing_wait: 3000, closing_wait2: infinte
        Flags: spd_normal skip_test session_lockout
----------------------------------
... yet /proc/interrupts says:
----------------------------------
# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       
  0:    8237337          XT-PIC  timer
  1:      51998          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  3:      87981          XT-PIC  smc91c92_cs
  5:          1          XT-PIC  soundblaster
  7:         15          XT-PIC  parport0
  8:          3          XT-PIC  rtc
 11:          4          XT-PIC  i82365
 12:      63520          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
 13:          1          XT-PIC  fpu
 14:      68540          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:          5          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0
----------------------------------
... No IRQ 4 events reported.  The /proc/ioports report looks normal.
Could the kernel be polling all the characters out before any interrupt 
gets generated?  Is anybody else seeing this?
The other oddity is with ESS 1869 vs. APM; after suspend-to-disk ->
power-off -> resume, the ESS mixer doesn't work any more.  That is,
I can run xmixer and appear to set things, but nothing actually
changes.  It does appear to work OK immediatly after booting.
(This is on a Chembook 3300T with K6-2/300, TX chipset.)
