you really need to understand intel optimisation guides.  it helps to diff 
them over time to see the types of things that go in and out of fashion.

your guess is generally wrong... try measuring it.
for p4 model 0 through 2 it was faster to avoid lea and shl and generate 
code like:
	add %ebx,%ebx
	add %ebx,%ebx
	add %ebx,%ebx
	add %ebx,%ebx
which would complete in 2 cycles, compared to 4 cycles for lea or a shift.  
but that crap doesn't apply to any other x86 (except efficeon which 
notices this crud and converts it to its own optimal sequence).
p4 model 2 is probably way more common than p4 model 3 still.
you also need to be aware of k7/k8.  AMD has their own optimisation guide 
(i'm too lazy to find url/#).  but the important point for lea and AMD is 
that it is a 2 cycle latency operation, and add is 1 cycle.
but you know what?  we can talk about what the optimization guides say 
until we're blue... the only thing which matters is experience.  go 
measure it.  (i've measured a bazillion things like this.)
use pop, don't use lea to modify esp.
