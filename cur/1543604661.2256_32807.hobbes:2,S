Not when your non-easy option requires every driver that needs a
library routine to patch lib/Makefile.  Adding a new driver should not
require a patch to an unrelated area of the kernel, it is bad design.
It also results on overlapping patches with the attendent risk of patch
rejects.  Anybody remember the common Space.c and all the problems that
file caused?
Kernel bloat is bad.  A kbuild design that will cause maintainence
problems in future is even worse.  Setting CONFIG_CRC32 at the time the
driver is selected is the cleanest solution.
