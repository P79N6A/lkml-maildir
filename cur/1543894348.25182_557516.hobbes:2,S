Done, but at this point I don't know what I'm looking at ;)
I'm attaching logs for working and non working kernels. I've made
apic_read_around() a nop in both cases since it doesn't influence the
outcome; the only difference is that working kernel writes directly to
the mapped APIC registers while the non-working one uses xchg.
As expected kernel side logs show zero differences (except for timer
calibration).
QEMU is a different story. The most obvious difference is that in
non-working case each write is preceded by a read at the same register
(due to xchg).
What is strange is that almost all the writes done using
apic_write_atomic are not hitting QEMU (see qemu.diff). In the log
there's only the read generated by the xchg.
For example, during timer calibration the kernel is doing:
write to 0x0b0
read from 0x390
but - in the non-working case - QEMU sees:
read from 0x0b0 (probably generated by xchg)
read from 0x390
but it doesn't see the write!
The write is not always lost:
apic_read: 0xffffd030 = 0x00050011
apic_write_atomic: 0xffffd370 = 0x000100fe
...
apic_read: fee00030 = 00050011
apic_read: fee00370 = 00010000
apic_write: fee00370 = 000100fe
