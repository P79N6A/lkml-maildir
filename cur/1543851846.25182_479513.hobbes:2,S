The "sane" decomposition of popf into uops something like this:
- Memory read
- Mask bits that are immutable in the current mode
- Trap to microcode on changing any bit that alters the pipeline state
The "trap to microcode" can obviously be arbitrarily expensive.  So when 
timing popf, it's also important to know *which* bits change.
The simplest case, obviously, is when no flags change.  I still *fully* 
expect that to be more painful than pushf ever is.
