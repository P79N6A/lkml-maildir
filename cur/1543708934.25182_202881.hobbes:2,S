Hard to tell. Standard Raw HDLC mode works fine but I couldn't find the
correct tools to setup PPP instead. And SBE support is not really
helpful unless you're using their drivers, which had been recently
updated to a version that actually works with late 2.4 kernels.

Their package consists of tools, a patch and a standalone module source.
Depending on the kernel version the patch needs to be applied, but it
should be in the latest kernels already. The source can be compiled
against any kernel tree and works reasonably well. It probably could be
integrated into the kernel, however given the attitude of SBE and the
senselessness of the rename and some other changes I don't see a good
reason why the community should help them by doing their homework.
Unless there's a reliable driver with working tools I don't see a good
reason to have this driver around. It already bit me hard in the rear
and I'd rather see someone bitch against SBE because their driver is not
working than hunt hours for mistakes and eventually end up with SBE
anyway.
Other than that I've learnt my lesson and selfish as I am, I will not
take it further than I already did.
