If the bug is in the non-GPLed BIOS, not in the GPLed code, too bad.
One more reason to dislike non-Free Software.
The freedom the GPL defends is not the freedom to modify and debug the
system, but rather the covered software.
Now, if you find evidence that the "bug" is actually intentionally put
there to stop you from doing what you wanted with the software, then
there's clearly a violation of the spirit of the license, and you
might even have a case of copyright infringement, but IANAL.
