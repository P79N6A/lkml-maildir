Looking at the Wine code, it doesn't seem to know.  It uses a GDT entry 
if possible in preference to an LDT entry, and appears to not care which 
TLS descriptor it gets.  So I think it would be safe to reserve selector 
0x40 for the BIOS real mode segment and move TLS up.  That's kind of a 
scary change, but I don't see anything wrong with it other than the 
testing implications.  Hopefully DOSEmu is not affected..
