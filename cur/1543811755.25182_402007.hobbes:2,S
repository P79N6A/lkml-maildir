Eh my patch is not missing, it's been merged since the start of
2.6.16-rc. The acpi patch is still missing, however that's not required
on all machines. So SATA suspend should work now, at least on ata_piix
which is the only driver that currently enables it.
For 2.6.15 I agree, we don't care about suspend since it basically
cannot work. That's not the case for 2.6.16 though.

I'm sure Hannes will regenerate against upstream as well if necessary,
however that depends on when this should be applied.
