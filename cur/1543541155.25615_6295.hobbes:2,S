No.

No.  Dropping the character is perfectly fine - it's the same thing that
happens on the keyboard (now), and it's about as complex as a hack like
SysRq should be, IMHO.

No it doesn't.  The character after a break gets handled the way it should
be - it gets interpreted as magic sysrq event, passed on to handle_sysrq,
and we forget about it.  It just happens to be a nop cause all SysRq keys
are when sysrq_enabled == 0.

Not sure I'm following - the character preceding a break condition shouldn't
be affected, unless you're talking about the 0 byte that gets put in the
FIFO for every break condition, which should get dropped.

Or we could just stop putting hacks in there and tell people to compile
without sysrq if they want to handle serial break events / alt-sysrq-x
combinations themselves.
