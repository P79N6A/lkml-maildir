return((drive->id->cfs_enable_1 & 0x0400) ? 1 : 0);
                                  ^^^^^^|__________ wtf?
These undefined numbers in the code are much more annoying to me...
but I don't have a C Style Police Badge.
Also, whatever that is, 0x400, I'll call it MASK, can have shorter
code like:
   return (drive->id->cfs_enable_1 && MASK); // TRUE/FALSE
... for pedantics...
   return (int) (drive->id->cfs_enable_1 && MASK);
Okay, gimmie a C Police Badge.......
Cheers,
