Unfortunately, while I was writing down the panic on a piece of paper, the 
screen blanking code kicked in while I was still copying down the register 
values.  I remember that the call trace mentioned some variant of a 
write_stuff_to_disk call, but that's not that useful...
When is the last time that the screen blanking code actually accomplished 
something useful?  These days it seems to exist for the purpose of destroying 
panic call traces and annoying people.  (I seem to remember that pressing a 
key used to make it come back, but now we're forced to use the input core 
that no longer seems to be the case...)
I also seem to remember a patch floating by on the list that would make 
console screen blanking go away.  I really think console screen blanking NOT 
being enabled should be the default these days.  Or at the very least, when 
there's a panic it should get shut off.  I'll add looking into that to my 
to-do list, but will probably get to it somewhere around 2009...
