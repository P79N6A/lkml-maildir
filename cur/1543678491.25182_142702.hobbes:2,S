Here's my reading off the screen:
	- /etc/init.d/pcmcia stop
	- The network card's lights go off
	- Above mentioned message starts and repeats every n seconds
	- /etc/init.d/networking stop is being executed, but doesn't
	  seem to stop the message. Though, it takes longer than
	  previously
	- The message appears last time just before APM powers my laptop
	  off...
