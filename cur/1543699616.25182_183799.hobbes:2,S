Yes, and I recall we agreed to disagree where the FDC stop must
be put, but we both agreed that it must be stopped. I still contend
that since the Linux startup code takes control away from the BIOS,
it's that codes responsibility to turn OFF things that the BIOS
might have left ON.
Funny thing. It's so trivial, anybody/everybody could turn the
floppy motor off, but all the fingers point to somebody else's
code.
It's a bug in Linux, not in a boot-loader. That bug was covered up
until the FDC code got modularized. Once we were able to compile
a kernel without the FDC, the bug was exposed. So, I suggest that
we just fix the bug and be done with it. It's not a performance
problem, the write to the port occurs exactly once during the nest
999 days of up-time. It's just an attempt to make a mountain out
of a mole-hill.
Cheers,
