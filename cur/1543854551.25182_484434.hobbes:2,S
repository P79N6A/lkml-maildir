No; one number, since it's controlled by the same set of bits in the GPIO
controller (e.g. bit 12 in the registers of bank 3) regardless of how the
signals are routed out through pins.  That's my point:  GPIO number need
not imply a particular pin, and vice versa.
Have a look at table 2-5 starting on page 81 of the OMAP 5912 datasheet
("Rev E", omap5912.pdf) linked at the top of
   
http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/omap5912.html
GPIOs start at p. 91; there are four banks of GPIO controllers, 16 gpios
each, and also a bank of MPUIOs starting at p. 95 ... half the MPUIO pins
can come out on two different balls, some of the GPIOs can be routed to any
of three different balls.  (A omap5912 is more or less an omap1611, fyi.)
So regardless of whether GPIO_62 is routed to ball M7 or G20, it's still
going to use number 62, which is bit 14 in various registers of the GPIO4
module, starting at 0xfffbb400 ... and for good fun, the muxing API will
refer to the balls on the (smaller) ZZG package even if your board uses
the larger ZDY package (so your schematics might say J5 not M7, that table
is very handy in such cases).
And if you consult table 2-2 on pg. 33 you'll be able to notice things
like ball R13 working for either MPUIO_0 or GPIO_36, ball V10 working
for MPUIO_10 or MPUIO_7, and so on.
