i'm using the linux kernel.
i'm also running several items not part of debian - kernel patches /
non-free software / phoenix (mmmm yummy) / stuff that i want bleeding
edge style (mplayerplugin, among others).
for a short while, i was using debian gnu/linux, but to me, what is on
my laptop is no longer what is supplied by the debian project. indeed,
the only users who could really be said to be running debian gnu/linux
are those using stable, with stock debian kernels.
i'm still using debian tools for most things (mmm aptitude...).
hth, hand,
iain
