The machine had not even been running the kernel for a day yet, when it got
the following error msg:
---
wait_on_bh cpu 0:
irq:  1 [0 1]
bh:   1 [0 0]
<[c010badd]> <[c014b059]> <[c010bebe]> <[c0109a20]>
---
This msg was being repeated at long intervals, and had repeated 5 times when I
got to the console.
c010baa0 T synchronize_bh
c010baf0 T synchronize_irq
c014b044 T dev_queue_xmit
c014b10c t dev_clear_backlog
c010be6c T do_IRQ
c010bec8 T setup_x86_irq
c0109a20 T ret_from_intr
If I can provide any more info, then please tell me.
