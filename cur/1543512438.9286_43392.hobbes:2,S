I didn't do that originally because there's not much there.  My System.map
has:
c01bdf70 T stext_lock
c01c02e8 r common_interrupt
and all the addresses are in stext_lock.  I also left the EIP alone: the
first kernel symbol is at 0xc0100000; the PCI BIOS entry is at 0xfbc30,
and EIP is at 0xc0000000 + 0xfbc30 + a bit.  Doesn't that mean we're
oopsing inside the PCI BIOS?
Tim.
