Would that be PL/I (F) or PL/I (H}?  You have different footprint problems 
with each of these levels.  You will also need to write some glue code to 
translate PL/I data structures to kernel structures.
Don't forget the 2000-line SED script to deal with namespace conversion in 
the PL/I object output.
(I still have my 30-year-old PL/I documentation from my mainframe days, 
including the compiler program logic manual.)
