But why is it, that the scheduler picks the lowest priority one? I 
thought sched_find_first_bit() picks the index of the lowest order bit 
in the bitmap and thus the highest priority job. Is that wrong?
What needs to be changed to let the scheduler pick the highest priority 
task from a given runqueue?
I am very confused ...
