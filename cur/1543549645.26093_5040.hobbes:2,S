i'm wondering about the following piece of code in refill_inactive():
                if (current->need_resched && (gfp_mask & __GFP_IO)) {
                        __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
                        schedule();
                }
shouldnt this be __GFP_WAIT? It's true that __GFP_IO implies __GFP_WAIT
(because IO cannot be done without potentially scheduling), so the code is
not buggy, but the above 'yielding' of the CPU should be done in the
GFP_BUFFER case as well. (which is __GFP_WAIT but not __GFP_IO)
Objections?
	Ingo
