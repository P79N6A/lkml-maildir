Ugh, this is a mess.  Daniel, why does your machine need this patch, yet
as per Dave's comments, it's wrong?
I think it might come down to the fact that the ordering before used to
not always happen in the same order (it depended on config options and
linker luck.)  Now it's "fixed" to be the same way all the time.
Daniel, can't you solve this with the proper pci boot option?
thanks,
greg k-h
