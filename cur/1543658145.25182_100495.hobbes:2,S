	1. A clearer legal situation either way would reduce
	   competitive economic pressure on employees and companies
	   alike to go into darker and darker grey areas.
	2. A clearer understanding that GPL-incompatible kernel
	   modules are illegal would prevent a repeat of the old
	   unix days when lots of companies invested money in
	   duplicating each other's kernel work.  Perhaps fewer
	   dollars would be invested this way, but I believe
	   that ultimately more functionality would be delivered
	   to more people.
	3. Most modestly, a clearer understanding that not every
	   kernel copyright owner grants the
	   EXPORT_SYMBOL / EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL permissions will at
	   least help everyone better assess the situation for
	   themselves in making their own decisions.

	Well, let's see.  I've recently posted GPL'ed patches to
shrink devfs to a fraction of its size, to clean up /dev/loop, to
remove 1-2 copies in the crypto api path depending on how it's used,
to eliminate the need for special locking to do raceless module
unloading, and my name appears in 11 of the 2.5 ChangeLog files for
various little things.  Sorry if I'm not working hard enough for you.
