Heh.. I needed to figure this out about 6 months ago.  Here's the "right
answer"
Before sending the command to the board, call
set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE).  This will prevent the scheduler
from interrupting your task, but more importantly it will prevent your task
from being re-scheduled (once you give up control) until the task is woken
up (which sets the state to TASK_RUNNING).
Then, send the command to the board.  Then call schedule() or
schedule_timeout() -- that won't return until your task is at TASK_RUNNING.
Now, if the interrupt fires before you call schedule, then schedule will
simply reschedule.  But, the wakeup re-set the state to TASK_RUNNING for
you, so your task _will_ get rescheduled (avoiding the deadlock).
See linux/drivers/usb/storage/transport.c usb_stor_bulk_msg() for the code
I wrote that uses this.  The key is in setting TASK_UNINTERRUPTABLE
_before_ you send the command, so that it doesn't race with the interrupt.
