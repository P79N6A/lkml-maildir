But what is stored in inode->i_generation? AFAICS
     inode->i_generation = le32_to_cpu (INODE_PKEY (inode)->k_dir_id);
which appears not to be a unique generation count. Isn't that instead
the directory's object id?
The point of i_generation is to provide a unique number that changes
every time you reuse the inode number.
