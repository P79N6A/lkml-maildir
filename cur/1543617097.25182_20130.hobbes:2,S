Wouldn't it be better for Aunt Tillie to continue using an all modular
kernel (from a distro) so she doesn't have to "update" (in your example,
that means recompile) a new one everytime she adds new hardware? Does
she have to connect all of here 1394 and USB devices to the computer
during this phase in order to have them all supported?
