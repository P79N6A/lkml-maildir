It should be as easy as e.g. doing a
int system_oopsed __read_mostly = 0;
if (!system_oopsed)
    blank();
in the timer handler as opposed to painfully deregistering the whole handler
in the critical system state after an OOPS.
A funny side effect is that this way even improves system stability
after OOPS, since the blanking (which doesn't happen then)
might bomb, too ;)
