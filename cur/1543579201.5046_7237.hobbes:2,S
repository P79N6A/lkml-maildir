You're probably just hearing electrical noise from the memory buss; try
moving the 128 stick to the slot you put the 64 in (if you can) and run
that way -- you'll probably hear it there too.
I get something similiar to this with my SB Live (!... damn marketroids) on
a BP6 with 192MB as well. In my case, it's not during DSP use per se, but
during memory activity. Try dragging a window around in X and listen for
buzzing.
My guess is that JA's console player doesn't move around as much memory as
the gnome one (imagine that), therefore produces less memory noise.
