Ok, that might be ok, but it will get overloaded as -EBUSY is
a possible return from a number of resource reservation calls.

WARN_ON() possibly, BUG() is a bit terminal to the whole kernel
process and if triggered before the console is working can be
rather hard to detect.
Possibly change this to:
	 if (!pdev->dev.platform_data) {
		dev_dbg(&pdev->dev, "no platform data supplied\n");
		WARN();
		return -EINVAL;
	}

ENODEV is part of the problem that we're trying to avoid returning
as it gets silently discarded by the device core. Unfortunately without
creating a new set of error codes specifically for device probes then
we're out of choice.

Yes, although the work to fixup some of these might be large it certainly
shouldn't be too complicated to do.
