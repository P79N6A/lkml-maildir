First, please put the changes in the LSM API in a different patch from
the xattr changes, they're a different issue.
The other question is why do you name them system.security?  The name
sounds a bit too generic to me.  ACLs are certainly a security feature
and have different ATTRS, similar for the Posix capability and MAC
support in XFS.  As selinux is the flask implementation for Linux
what about system.flask_label?  (or system.selinux_label?)
