Agreed ;). OTOH there's a minor pros with such SMP irq design that we are
forced to use: we kill irq latency best. IO-APIC AFIK chooses the CPU that
is handling the lower bus load at irq time, but it doesn't choose the CPU
that has irq enabled AFIK.
From 24319201.pdf 7.4.10:
	"From all processors listed in the destination, the processor
	 selected is the one whose current arbitration priority is the
	 lowest."
