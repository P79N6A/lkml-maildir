Hi all,
I wonder whether anyone could use the pktcddvd device without killing
random jobs (due to sudden out of memory or better memory leaks in
pktcddvd) and finally a complete freeze of the machine ?
To reproduce just create an udf filesystem on some dvdrw, mount it rw
and copy some large file to the mount point.
Do others also see this behaviour and if so is this going to be fixed
soon - or am I alone with that problem ?
Soeren.
