Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: Replace remaining "depends" with "depends on"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/13/85

  Replace the very few remaining "depends" Kconfig directives with
"depends on".
Signed-off-by: Robert P. J. Day <rpjday@mindspring.com>

  Given the recent patch that was applied to make this transformation,
might as well finish it off and deal with those last three cases.
  At this point, all Kconfig files should contain *only* "depends on"
and neither "depends" nor "requires", so whoever is responsible for
the care and feeding of the parser might consider dropping support for
those latter directives if there's no overwhelming rationale to keep
supporting them.
  Unlike in Perl, "there's more than one way to do it" doesn't apply
equally well to kernel source.  :-)
