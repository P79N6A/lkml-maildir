This patch fixes a screen corruption bug seen on VIA KM133 mainboards.
As it stands, we disable bits 5, 6, and 7 of register offset 55 in order
to disable the memory write queue, which was causing us trouble before.
However, the clearing of bits 5 and 6 is causing us trouble now.  Whenever 
they're cleared, the screen gets static across it, roughly corresponding 
to IDE/PCI activity.  I spoke to one of the developers involved in the 
original fix, and he suggested that we go ahead and not clear bits 5 and 6 
on these boards, and that he was aware of several instances where clearing 
them causes trouble.
Here is a patch which should apply cleanly to everyone's tree, which
only clears bit 7 on all chips except the KT266.  No problems have been
reported there, so I'm leaving well enough alone.  Please apply.
Thanks
