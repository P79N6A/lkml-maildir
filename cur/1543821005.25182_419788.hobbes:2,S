Currently.  We are running out of CLONE_ bits - in mainline, there are
three left, and two of them are likely to be used by CLONE_TIME and
CLONE_UTSNAME (or whatever that turns out to be called).
I'm eyeing the low eight bits (CSIGNAL) for future unshare flags, but
those would be unusable in clone().
And why should there be any overlap between clone flags and unshare
flags?  Isn't 
	clone(CLONE_TIME);
the same as 
	clone();
	unshare(CLONE_TIME);
?
