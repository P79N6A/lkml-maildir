UHCI. I just did a test-suspend-resume, currently plugged USB devices don't work, but it does show up in the devices file. It also responds to replugging.... I don't get it.
 I had no response whatsoever earlier. Mouse doesn't work until replugged, lots of messages like this in dmesg:
Oct  4 14:16:49 precious kernel: drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: input irq status -84 received
Oct  4 14:16:54 precious last message repeated 209 times
