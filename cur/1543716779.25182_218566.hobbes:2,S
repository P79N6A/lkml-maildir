linux/vermagic.h now references a variable in kernel/module.c.
Since this file is only included for CONFIG_MODULES=y, CONFIG_MODULES=n 
results in the following compile error:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
kernel/built-in.o(.data+0xc54): undefined reference to `vermagic'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
