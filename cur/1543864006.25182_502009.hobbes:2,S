You guys need to backup in this thread.
Every example of O_DIRECT here could be replaced with
calls to mmap(), msync(), and madvise() (or posix_fadvise).
In addition to being at least as fast as O_DIRECT,
these have the added benefit of using the page cache 
(avoiding reads for data already present, handling multiple
users of the same data, etc..).
