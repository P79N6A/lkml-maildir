I was trying to keep consistant with what the old /proc values were
reported as.  I'll go fix that up.
As for why no floating point, it's a pain in the but to both output a
fixed point number from the kernel into floating point, and to parse a
floating point number from userspace within the kernel, turning it into
a fixed point number.  With the proposal I wrote up, none of that is
needed, and all userspace has to do is divide by a factor of 10 to get
the proper value.
It's much simpler and easier to validate we got it right code.  If
you're still not convinced take a look at the code in
drivers/i2c/i2c-proc.c::i2c_parse_reals() for an example of some hairy
code...
