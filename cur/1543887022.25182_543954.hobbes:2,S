Eric,
I got one question about kexec and bzImage on 64bit kernel.
The bzImage for 64bit kernel must be loaded under 4G?
but vmlinux for 64bit kernel could be loaded above 4G.
So is there any plan to use 64bit entry point (startup_64) in
arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/vmlinux in bzImage? so you may
load bzImage above 4G too.
