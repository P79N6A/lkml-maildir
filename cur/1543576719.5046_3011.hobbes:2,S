That's not a notebook, with a Duron CPU.
For what it's worth, here's a current /proc/apm output:
1.13 1.2 0x03 0x01 0xff 0x80 -1% -1 ?
That does not really tell us any more than we have APM driver version
1.13, APM BIOS v1.2, that it does support 16 and 32 bit, but idle does
not slow the clock, APM is engaged and enabled, that we're running
on-line and we don't know how long the power plants will last ;-)
