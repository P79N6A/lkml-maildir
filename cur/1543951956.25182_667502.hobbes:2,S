Hi Alex/Kenji-san,
Time for my 2 cents.

Agreed.

Based on my review of ACPI spec 3.0b I would add:
  1. For a specific device that has only _STA and _SUN methods,
     _SUN can be run and it's results can be trusted irrespective
     of the _STA return value.
  2. For a specific device that has _STA, _INI, and _SUN methods,
     _SUN can be run and it's results can be trusted even if
    _INI is not run because the device is absent.  If the device
    is present and _INI is run then _SUN cannot be run until
    after _INI is run.
  See ACPI spec 3.0b "6.1.8 _SUN (Slot User Number)" which
  says nothing about a required presence of the device.

I checked this on the IBM x3850 and it appears to be true.  I 
instrumented register_slot() in drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c
to print _STA and _SUN returns and got the following results with
slot 1 (PCI-X) populated, slot 2 (PCI-X) vacant, slot 3 (PCIe) vacant,
slot 4 (PCIe) populated, slot 5 (PCIe) vacant, and slot 6 (PCIe)
populated.  When a card is present _STA returns non-zero status
for all functions, otherwise it returns zero.  None of the SxFy
devices have an _INI method.

I am not convinced that this a correct interpretation.  I believe
that the ACPI spec indicates that it is legal to call _SUN and
trust it's results no matter what _STA returns.  I believe the
only constraint on running _SUN is that it be run after _INI is run
if _INI exists for the same device and _STA for that device
indicates that it should be run.
