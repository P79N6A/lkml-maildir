Hmm, neither do I. Looking in MAINTAINERS I don't see anybody, and
looking in the sources I find just a company name `Neterion'.
So, lacking an email address for a maintainer, sending your patch to
linux-kernel is the right thing to do (even if you had found a
maintainer, adding linux-kernel to Cc: would usually also be proper).
If you get no response at all from the list or maintainer, then Andrew
Morton is the head 2.6 maintainer.
