I'm not sure about the mga source, but you can enable busmaster manually
as root.  See the dri-devel list for more.  I can't remember the exact
message off hand.  THere was also some discussion of this last week I
think.

Hi, 
  friend of mine bought g400 on my recommendation, and unfortunately, 
mga drm driver did not worked for me. I tracked it down to missing 
pci_enable_device and pci_set_master in mga* driver. But even after 
looking more than hour into that code I have no idea where I should 
place this call, as it looks like that mga driver is completely 
shielded from seeing pcidev structure :-( 
  Does anybody know where I should place pci_enable_device and 
pci_set_master into mga code? I worked around pci_enable_device by 
using matroxfb, but pci_set_master is not invoked by matroxfb, and 
adding this call into matroxfb just to get mga drm driver to work does 
not look correctly to me - although it is what I had done just now. 
                                    Thanks, 
                                            Petr Vandrovec
