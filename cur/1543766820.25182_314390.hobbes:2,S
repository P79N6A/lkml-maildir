No.  It is exactly _one_ Java process that _does_ _not_ _react_ to kill -9.  Apart
from this, the system is responsive and the other processes get their CPU
share as usual (eg if I run another process that normally would get ~100%
of the CPU, now it gets 50% of it and the rest is "used" for the Java).
It looks like a kernel bug to me this time.
