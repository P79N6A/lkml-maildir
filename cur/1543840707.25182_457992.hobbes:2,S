This has been helped along by serial_core - drivers have helper
functions which they call (along with their min/max baud rate)
which handles all this stuff.
The one thing your idea is missing is how to handle the "user
requested 15mbaud but I can only do 115200baud" case - POSIX
prefers you to report back what you actually selected rather
than error out.  If you merely pass an integer to the drivers,
they can't do that.
Note also that some drivers effectively have run-time configurable
max baud rates, so you can't pass a fixed set of capabilities to
the tty layer on driver initialisation.
