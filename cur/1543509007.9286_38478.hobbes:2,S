(first post to l-k, please be gentle :-))
There's a nasty memory leak in 2.3.{17,18}, _possibly_ caused by changes
to scsi_malloc in the 2.3.17 patch.
When idle I lost perhaps one (4k) page every 20 seconds. Holding down
Alt-SysRq-M made it leak faster as info was being written to syslog and
thus flushed to disk. Heavy disk IO made it leak significantly faster.
Running 2.3.16 and using the SysRq-M trick, I see the 4k pages being
allocated in the same manner, but the memory is freed about every 128k. 
System: 2.3.17 SMP with Adaptec aic7895 using both channels. 
More information available, just let me know what you need.
