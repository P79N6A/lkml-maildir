There is currently (and has always been it seems) a problem
with flush_to_ldisc().
The below diff is against 2.4.20 and contains some stuff made in 2.5,
as well, but the important thing is to set TTY_DONT_FLIP
while processing the flip buffer.
Otherwise, on slow systems or systems with high load and
fast flipping (high baudrates) a new flip might start before
the next flip has been processed, resulting in that characters
could be lost or perhaps arrive out of order.
A driver can write data to a flip buffer that really isn't processed yet.
At least that is what I think happens...
Does it make sense?
