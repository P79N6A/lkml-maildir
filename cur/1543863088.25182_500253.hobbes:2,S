I'm not sure you read the correct patch. Let me explain the logic again.
assume:
min = 123pages
pagecache_reserved = 200 pages
if( alloc_flags & ALLOC_PAGECACHE)
        watermark = min + pagecache_reserved ( 323 pages)
else
        watermark = min ( 123 pages)
So if request pagecache, when free pages < 323 pages, reclaim is triggered.
But at this time if request memory not pagecache, reclaim will be
triggered when free pages < 123 as the present reclaimer does.
I verified it on my side, why do you think it doesn't work properly?

So if application malloc(1M), how does kernel know to allocate
reserved pool not from buddy system? I didn't see any special code
about this. Is there any doc or example?
