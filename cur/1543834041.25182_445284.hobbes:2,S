I was referring to the different ways the two patches figure out whether
we're in user mode:
Yours:
 static inline int user_mode(struct pt_regs *regs)
 {
       return (regs->xcs & USER_MODE_MASK) != 0;
 }
Where you have for native:
	#define USER_MODE_MASK 3
vs Xen:
	#define USER_MODE_MASK 2
Zach's patch does this:
 static inline int user_mode(struct pt_regs *regs)
 {
	return (regs->xcs & SEGMENT_RPL_MASK) == 3;
 }
I'm no x86pert, but the latter seems more generic to me (user mode is
ring 3, vs. usermode is anything >= 2).  Perhaps they are in fact
equivalent?
Thanks!
Rusty.
