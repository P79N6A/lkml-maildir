Somebody wrote code that used Linux Threads. We didn't know
why it was so slow so I was asked to investigate. It was
a user-interface where high-speed image data gets put into
a buffer (using DMA) and one thread manipulates it. Another
thread copies and crunches the data, then displays it. The
writer insisted that he was doing the correct thing, however
the response sucked big time. I ran top and found that the
threaded processes were always grabbing big chunks of
CPU time. Searching for every instance of sched_yield(), I
was going to replace it with a diagnostic. However, the code
ran beautifully when the 'fprintf(stderr, "Message\n"' was
in the code! The call to write() sleeps. That gave the
CPU to somebody who was starving. The 'quick-fix" was
to replace sched_yield() with usleep(0).
The permanent fix was to not use threads at all.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
