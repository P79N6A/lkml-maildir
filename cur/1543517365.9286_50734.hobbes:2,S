Hello,
I was wondering if anyone on this list has ever seen a port
of the UNIX 'tip' command for Linux? I've tried most places that
I know of and no luck...  Otherwise, what would you recommend as a 
replacement, that's on the same level of functionality-- ie. not 
something like minicom, etc...
I apologize for the [Way OT].
Thanks in advance,
