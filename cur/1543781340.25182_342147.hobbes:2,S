Thanks Willy,
So i just compile a new Kernel with options we have talking about...
And it's freeze, nothing to the console...
So i need to find the way to enable the Level-Triggered Interrupts in the kernel
to the right IRQ address...
I read the thread... but i can't find the thing to change in kernel source or
kernel configuration.
Or perhaps i enable to many option in
"Device Drivers  --->" "Character devices-->" "Serial drivers  --->"
<*> 8250/16550 and compatible serial support                     x x
  x x    [*]   Console on 8250/16550 and compatible serial port           x x
  x x    (4)   Maximum number of non-legacy 8250/16550 serial ports       x x
  x x    [*]   Extended 8250/16550 serial driver options                  x x
  x x    [*]     Support more than 4 legacy serial ports                  x x
  x x    [*]     Support for sharing serial interrupts                    x x
  x x    [ ]     Autodetect IRQ on standard ports (unsafe)                x x
  x x    [*]     Support special multiport boards                         x x
  x x    [*]     Support RSA serial ports
Try autodetect IRQ ?
I'll try to learn more about  edge/level irq sharing...
