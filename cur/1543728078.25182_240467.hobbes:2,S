Some addition: Even if your statement is correct, the data read is not
different, as C1 error correction should mask it. Yes, the quality
obviosly is lower, but most probably you won't notice it, unless the
disk degrades with time/scratches and now more errors appear, so it
isn't correctable anymore. But I think it is paranoic to rather have
coasters than living with a bit less quality at some spots where buffer
underruns occured.
