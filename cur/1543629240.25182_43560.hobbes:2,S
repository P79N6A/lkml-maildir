Usually using both master and slave on an IDE channel spells disaster
performance wise, and I would be surprised if the hotplug stuff worked
with this as well...

Use 8 controllers for the 15 (16) drives.

Because RAID controllers do not use the PCI bus ???    ;)
The bus-overhead on RAID-5 is not too bad unless you specifically construct
a workload to make it so (writes-only, scattered so that the kernel cannot
cache stripes to avoid read-in for parity calculation).
Sure, the PCI bus will be a bottleneck, and PCI overhead alone will decrease
the real-world performance to somewhere below the theoretical PCI bandwidth
limitations, but don't let this blind you  -  100 MB/sec sustained transfers
can still be "good enough" for many people.
By the way, has anyone tried such larger multi-controller setups, and tested
the bandwidth in configurations with multiple PCI busses on the board, versus a
single PCI bus ?
