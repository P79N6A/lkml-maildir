This is something i was thinking to suggest.
Kernel is made of a lot of different "areas" and the regression list
is a great tool for monitoring every single area so why not opening a
new branch and accepting patches only for areas which are not in the
current regression list.?
Sounds like a good way to be more strict about regressions and
incentive people to solve regressions quicker.
