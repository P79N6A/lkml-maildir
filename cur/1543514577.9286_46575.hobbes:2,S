It appears to be a leading interrupt that does not get cleared in the
driver.  Since this is an evolving issue as the hardware changes, it is
painful to attempt to wrap a headache around this new issue.
First thing to try is a chipset tuning "monster" patch on your local
kernel mirror.
Since you are poking an ATA-66 device with an ATA-33 host adapter, you
need to verfiy that the "controller is in the correct mode and the drive
is back-speed to the correct transfer rate.
What does "hdparm -iI /dev/hda" return?
