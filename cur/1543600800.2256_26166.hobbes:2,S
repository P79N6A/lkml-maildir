Noflushd can be useful in this case, though it needs a patch to
include/linux/kernel_stat.h in order to work with more than one

I will be switching my email addresses from @ferret.dyndns.org to
@mail.aom.geek on or after September 1, 2001, but not until after
Debian's servers include support. 'geek' is an OpenNIC TLD. See
http://www.opennic.unrated.net
 for details about adding OpenNIC
support to your computer, or ask your provider to add support to
their name servers.
