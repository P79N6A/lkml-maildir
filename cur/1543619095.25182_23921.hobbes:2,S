Note that I'm not sure whether the complexity of using
4 MB pages is worth it or not ... I just like the fact
that the radix tree page cache gives us the opportunity
to easily implement and try it.
I like radix trees for making our design more flexible
and opening doors to possible new functionality.
It could even be a CONFIG option for the embedded folks,
if we can keep the code isolated enough ;)
cheers,
Rik
