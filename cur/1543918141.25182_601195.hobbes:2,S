Anton's post (
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=118133042025995&w=2
) (and
my subsequent reposts) may have helped prompt this full series, which
then was picked up and shown to be useful to other folks. NUMA systems
with memoryless nodes exist in the wild and Linux did not do the right
thing there. Admittedly, Anton's case is hugetlb-specific, but the fix
I've been proposing (and hope to repost soon) depends on Christoph's
patches, especially the THISNODE fix.
Thanks,
Nish
