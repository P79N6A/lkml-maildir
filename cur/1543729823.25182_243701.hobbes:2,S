Not unlimited! I just collected all commands that were blocked from
cdrecord and growisofs. Actually, quite a lot :-/ But I'm far from
being expert enough to judge if those commands are safe or not.
Just for the records and if someone is interested it:
In addition to the patch Andreas Messer sent a while I ago, those
commands had to be set safe_for_read on SusE 9.1 with a Nec ND-1300A
and a Plextor PlexWriter W5224TA:
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_PREVENT_ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL),
+               safe_for_read(REZERO_UNIT),
+               safe_for_read(0xe9),		/* drive specific, unknown */
+               safe_for_read(0xed),		/* drive specific, unknown */
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_MODE_SELECT_10),
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_READ_FORMAT_CAPACITIES),
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_FLUSH_CACHE),
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_SEND_OPC),
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_BLANK),
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_WRITE_10),
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_FORMAT_UNIT),
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_SEND_CUE),
+               safe_for_read(0xf5),		/* drive specific, unknown */
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_READ_BUFFER_CAPACITY),
+               safe_for_read(GPCMD_CLOSE_TRACK),
