May I suggest running "vmstat 1" while this is happening? Looking at the 
waitio time vs. transfer rates might reveal something. If it all looks 
the same post a small section, if it starts off looking like one thing 
and then changes as buffers fill, data from start to steady state might 
assist someone in helping.
I can't say that I see any such thing with ext[23], so it may be a 
reiser issue and someone else will have to help. Did you look at the 
logs to see that there are no useful warnings there?
