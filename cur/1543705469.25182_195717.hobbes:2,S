hi,
google showd me that this is problem since linux 2.2
i run a linux 2.6.1 om my ACER tm620 and the driver by Donald Becker.
My build-in card gets the timeout and after:
 transmit timed out: status 0050 0cf0 at xxxxx/xxx command 000c0000 it works again (for some time)
The eepro100 is compiled in.
should i spend time to find more infos ?
regards,
walter
