Yes, it would be better to fix that. At least it would make
the code cleaner than the add checks for this backdoor everywhere.

AFAIK cpu hotplug has more problems in oprofile anyways. That is why
I didn't test that case.

The reason I added the kmalloc is that there's also a varying number
of separate fixed function counters (although that's not currently
submitted).
Also I would prefer to not have a hard coded number for future
CPUs. Contrary to other people's opinion architectural perfmon is
not for Nehalem only.
