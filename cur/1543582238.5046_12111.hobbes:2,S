The exact error is in /usr/include/linux/msg.h
The three unsigned shorts should be unsigned int instead.
Would too many things break if this was changed?
Should user-space tools like ipcs be rewritten to use /proc/sysvipc
instead? (I notice that my old 2.2.14 kernel doesn't have
/proc/sysvipc...)
Thanks.
