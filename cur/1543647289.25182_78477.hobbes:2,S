That falls apart for multiple-bus drivers.
The way the current config files handle this seems reasonable...  for 
example drivers/net/ in fact _already_ splits things up by bus type to 
some extent.  But this is not a hard and fast rule, just easing some pain.

This reminds me of another point:
An eventual goal is for people, mostly initial driver merges or vendors, 
to be able to add a simple driver without patching _any_ files.
Which implies that the equivalent of "source drivers/net/Config*" 
(wildcarding) in Roman's system would be useful.  Or maybe "source 
drivers/net" and it knows that when given a directory it should scan for 
all Config* files in that dir.
