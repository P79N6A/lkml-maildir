Remember, sysfs files are supposed to be small, you are an "oddity" in
that you have a much larger buffer that you can return due to the wierd
aliases you have.
Truncating the buffer is probably good as we want userspace to get some
information, right?

How about just making this a binary attribute, then you can handle an
arbitrary size buffer and don't have to worry about the PAGE_SIZE stuff
(but it makes it more code that you have to write to handle it all,
there are tradeoffs...)
