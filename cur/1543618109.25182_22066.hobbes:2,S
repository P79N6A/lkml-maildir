I/O intensive threads block early voluntarily - while CPU hogs don't.
Statistically there is a higher chance, that a CPU hog gets preempted
instead of an IO bound (that gives up the CPU in some useconds anyway)
The next IO request is hitting the device "earlier" - instead of waiting
for the next schedule() - that makes sense to me.
With this scenario the system CPU utilization gets "bigger" for the benefit
of "faster" IO. OTOH, seti@home needs longer to run.
