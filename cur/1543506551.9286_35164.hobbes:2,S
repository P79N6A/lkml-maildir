Probably it's the bug I discovered some year ago on my old Epox
motherboard. The workaround I discovered is to not
disable_dma()/enable_dma() in the dma-completation irq. My workaround is
been reimplemented inside the PCI-quirks kernel config option (enable it
in the kernel configuration and the lockup should disappear).
