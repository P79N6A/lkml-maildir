the only thing you've to be careful is to make sure you set
the correct options for the module (if you compiled it as module).
# options=0x30 100mbps full duplex
# options=0x20 100mbps half duplex
# options=0     10mbps half duplex
options eepro100 options=0
Otherwise, it'll cause a lot of unnecessary network traffic and
slow down your network!
These are not obvious unless you read the source code.
Jeff.

There are always problems with some hardware, but my personal
recommendation for a card would definitely be the Intel Ethernet Pro 100
series (82557). 
Unlike the tulip cards (which are pretty good too), there aren't a
million different versions of it.  There's a few, but it's not a big
mess.  It performs well, and is stable.  It's pretty well documented
(apart from the magic extensions), and it's common. 
That said, some people have trouble even with that card.  Nobody knows
why, but at least the driver is actively maintained etc, so I still am
not nervous about recommending it. 
I bet that others will have other recommendations, but so far I have at
least personally had good luck with the eepro100.
