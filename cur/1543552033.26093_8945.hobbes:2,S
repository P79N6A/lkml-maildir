They already need probably, e.g. to handle the new UDP error behaviour.
Actually I did not propose to change the default behaviour (or rather
not change it back), just to give the applications a way to set the
behaviour *they* want as needed.

Sounds like a bug that should be reported to Sun.

I agree that the default should be 2.2 compatible. Adding the sysctl
to magically break these applications would be probably bad  (just
remember ip_dynaddr and bind ;)

Ok, sysctl to off (or better no sysctl and only the setsockopt to enable the 
more liberal behaviour)
