Hmm, I just did a cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power:
active state:            C1
default state:           C1
bus master activity:     00000000
states:
    *C1:                  promotion[--] demotion[--] latency[000] 
usage[00000000]
     C2:                  <not supported>
     C3:                  <not supported>
I am currently NOT using APIC mode (nforce2, as well) and using vanilla 
2.6.4. It seems C1 halt state isn't used, which exlains why I am having 
trouble to keep my CPU cooler these day. I once started a thread 
suspecting acpi timer, but it is not the case. It seems to be something 
else. As I don't use PIC, it cannot be that  8259-timer-ack-fix.patch 
causin git, or can it? Maybe something broken in ACPI? I might try out 
older kernels to find out...
