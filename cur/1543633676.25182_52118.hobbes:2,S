Sure, that would be fine too.
The main user demand has been for 2.4.x drivers on 2.2.x.  If there is 
demand for 2.0.x driver support or, what you describe, 2.5.x driver 
support on 2.[24].x, that's a good direction to head towards.  I haven't 
seen any requests for that from driver authors yet.

I am sadly guilty of "NIH" in several cases, but actually this is not 
one of them :)  I think that kcompat24 provides a bit more of a complete 
compatibility package than the other solutions.  So, I would like to 
borrow code from pcmcia and other sources to make this toolkit even 
better.  (patches accepted! :))
