There are a couple of points I would make about your python test 
harness.  Your program compares real+system jiffies for both cpus; an 
ideal result would be 1.00.  The measurement is taken over a relatively 
short period of approximately a half-second, and you kill the CPU hogs 
before taking final measurements, even wait for them to die first.  You 
repeat this measurement, starting and killing CPU hogs each time.  Why 
do you do that?
What happens if you start the hogs and take the baseline outside of the 
loop?
    from __future__ import division
    import sys, os, time
    def getCpuTimes():
        cpu0 = 0
        cpu1 = 1
        for line in open("/proc/stat"):
            tokens = line.split()
            if tokens[0] == "cpu0":
                cpu0 = int(tokens[1]) + int(tokens[3])
            elif tokens[0] == "cpu1":
                cpu1 = int(tokens[1]) + int(tokens[3])
        return cpu0, cpu1
    pid = os.spawnl(os.P_NOWAIT, "./priosched")
    baseline = getCpuTimes()
    while True:
        time.sleep(0.5)
        current = getCpuTimes()
        print "%.04f" % (current[0] - baseline[0]) / (current[1] -
    baseline[1])
