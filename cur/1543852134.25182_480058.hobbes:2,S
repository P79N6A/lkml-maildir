The fix is simple enough, it's just not as clean as I'd like.  I have to 
pull apart the contents of the ht_irq_msg that the new update hook is 
getting passed, in order to get the vector out, so that I can reprogram 
the offending chip register after I've done the config space writes. 
It's a pretty roundabout way to do the job.
