Hi,
when I select "Support for frame buffer devices" in the
Console driver section of xconfig, the menue item
"ATI Mach64 display support" changes from grey to
black but neither the "y" nor the "n" button is selectable.
After playing around with other menu items in the
console driver section the following messeage appears
when I try to select "ATI Mach64 support":
syntax error in expression "(null)|16"
    while executing
"expr $CONFIG_FBCON_MAC|16"
    (procedure "update_menu27" line 175)
    invoked from within
"update_menu27 .menu27"
    invoked from within
".menu27.config.f.x33.n invoke"
    ("uplevel" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"uplevel #0 [list $w $cmd]"
    (procedure "tkCheckRadioInvoke" line 3)
    invoked from within
"tkCheckRadioInvoke .menu27.config.f.x33.n"
    (command bound to event)
Cheers, Thomas
