I like this, too.  (Not surprisingly, having outlined something like  
it in a mail in one of the previous threads :)).
I'll bring up the POSIX AIO "list" IO case.  It wants to issue a  
group of IOs and sleep until they all return.  Being able to cheaply  
instantiate a ring implicitly with the submission of the IO calls in  
the list will make implementing this almost too easy.  It'd obviously  
just wait for that list's ring to drain.
I hope.  There might be complications around the edges (waiting for  
multiple list IOs to drain?), but it seems like this would be on the  
right track.
I might be alone in caring about having a less ridiculous POSIX AIO  
interface in glibc, though, I'll admit.  It seems like it'd be a  
pretty sad missed opportunity if we rolled a fantastic general AIO  
interface and left glibc to still screw around with it's own manual  
threading :/.
