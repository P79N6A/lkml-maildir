Subject: [PATCH] firewire: fw-ohci: sync AT dma buffer before use
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/12/355

Per DMA API docs, when using dma_map_single(), DMA_TO_DEVICE synchronization
must be done after the last modification of the memory region by software
before it can be handed off to the device and safely read. Such a sync is
currently missing from firewire_ohci:at_context_queue_packet().
At least on my setup, where I could within seconds reliably reproduce a panic
in handle_at_packet() by simply dd'ing from two drives on different controllers,
the panic is gone.
