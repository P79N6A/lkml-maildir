Hi,
I installed this patch onto one of my pop3/imap servers in my farm, and it
crashed pretty hard today. I didn't get any crash data though, another
admin rebooted it. This was after approx. 24 hours uptime. My service log
shows load went absolutely through the roof, as high as 214, but memory
never got above 88%. I will give it another try on Monday, I don't want
any weekend issues to come up.
Josh
