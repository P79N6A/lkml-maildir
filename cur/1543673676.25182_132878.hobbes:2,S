You can get exclusive access with mangling the system call, simply by
having init  bind itself to the non-exclusive processors on boot.
Try it. Every task will then end up on only the non-exclusive
processors.  Seems a very simple change to me, and one that can be done
in user-space.
You do not even have to modify init, if you do not want.  Grab

 and put a taskset call in your rc.d
