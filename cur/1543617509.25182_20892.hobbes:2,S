Ben, yes you are right, the lse-posting in a second reading is misleading.
As reported previously 
http://lse.sourceforge.net/pipe/pipe-report
UP numbers see degradations for LM-Bench, other benchmarks are OK.
This is not solved either by an integration of zero-copy with large pipes.
We have however shown that the for SMP systems adding larger pipes to
zero-copy pipes makes sense and for UP and 1-way sticking with a 1-page 
pipe does not degradate Manfred's patch.
It hence boils down to a proper parameterization of the pipe dependent on 
the configuration.
