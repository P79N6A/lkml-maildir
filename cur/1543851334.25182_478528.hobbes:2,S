Hello list,
I know this is a problem with a RH kernel but I also know RH gurus 
monitor this list
and make contributions.
I just upgraded to FC6 and now my HP pavilion n5430 laptop hangs during 
boot right after displaying
a bunch of stuff about acpi.
kernel 2.6.18-1.2200.fc5 works OK can I run it on fc6?
Thanks a bunch,
Steve
