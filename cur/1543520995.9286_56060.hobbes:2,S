Certainly! Only continuing in this way we have to time wait not for 60 seconds,
and even not for old good one 240, but at least for big TCP timeout + 240.
LAST_ACK at another end may inject retransmits to network for all this time. 8)
Essentially, all this is big bug in TCP and all the protections,
not based on tcp extensions, are purely probabilistic. "Assasination hazard"
is hazard of second or even third order of smallness, comparing to major ones.
