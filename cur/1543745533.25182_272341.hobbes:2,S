Of course, there is no way to guarantee correctness. the point is with 
the current system the chances of being correct are around 1:(average 
instruction length) (a bit better because there is a chance to resync), 
while with my proposal to be _incorrect_ you need to start wrong _and_ 
hit a bad resync.
I don't get to see many oopsen, but it seems to me most would have 
garbage before eip, no?
