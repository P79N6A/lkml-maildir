Why not just queue them onto a kernel thread (i.e krmd) and let it delete
the files when the system is idle? 
When a user deletes the files, they do disappear, they just get reassigned
to krmd and that's it as far as the user is concerned. krmd wakes up at a
suitable free moment and deletes the queued stuff (maybe we can use the
timeslice interval to delete n amount of stuff and the go back to sleep,
wake up again delete another n amount).
Whattayathink?
