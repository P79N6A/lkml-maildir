*Ugh*.  If one really wants reiserfs v3 -> v4 conversion, presumably
there are much more intelligent ways to do that.  For one thing,
you really don't want to create an empty tree and move the stuff
from original node-by-node - that would give a shitload of IO on
tree rebalancing alone, not to mention the PITA it will be for allocator
(you get to reshuffle trees a lot on potentially almost full fs).
