Hey,
i tried to switch my root partition to ext4 (from reiserfs) but i ran
into problems when copying over all the data that it says 'no space
left on the device'
i'm running 2.6.28-gentoo-r1 (based on 2.6.28.1 if i'm not mistaken)
i deleted quite a bit and then tried copying again, this time it still
gave the same error but more files (data wise didn't count if the
files were bigger) were copied. currently df shows
rootfs                 5044188   4310972    476980  91% /  <= file
system that is 'full'
