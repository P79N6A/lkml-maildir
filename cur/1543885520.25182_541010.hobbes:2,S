Working with smaller quantums is indeed the right thing to do.
In any case, let's consider why you're getting 100 events from one 
epoll_wait():
1. You have a single thread doing the dequeue, and it is taking a long 
time (perhaps due to the time it is taking to requeue the work in other 
threads).
2. Your load is so high that you are taking lots and lots of events, in 
which case the other epoll_wait() threads are going to be woken up very 
soon with work anyway. In this scenario you will be "scheduling" work at 
"odd" times based on its arrival, but that's just another argument to use 
smaller quantums.
I'm referring specifically to edge-triggered behavior, btw. I find 
edge-triggered development far easier and saner in a multi-threaded 
environment, and doing level-triggered and multi-threaded at the same time 
certainly seems like the wrong thing to do.
In any case, I see little point in a thread whose job is simply to move 
something from queue A (epoll ready list) to queue B (thread work list). 
My latest code basically uses epoll_wait() as a load balancing mechanism 
to pass out work. The quantums are fairly small. There may be situations 
where you get a burst of traffic that one thread handles while others are 
momentarily idle, but handling that traffic is a very quick operation (and 
everything is non-blocking). You really only need the other threads to 
participate when the load starts to get to the point where the 
epoll_wait() calls will be constantly returning anyway.

Great. I'm just glad I saw this mail -- I probably would have burned quite 
some time in the coming weeks trying to figure out why my epoll code 
wasn't running quite smoothly.
