Looks like it, since it passed the uevent failures to the upper layer.

This depends on what semantics uevent returning an error code should
have. The firmware code was using it to suppress uevents, but
uevent_suppress is a better idea now. So if we want uevent returning !=
0 to imply "something really bad happened", all uevent functions have
to be audited and those that work like firmware_uevent have to be
converted to uevent_suppress. This would be cleaner, but I'm not sure
it's worth the work.
