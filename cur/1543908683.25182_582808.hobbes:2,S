Ok.

Looks ok, but I'm not sure which workload this is supposed to improve.
There is one workload that still isn't performing well; it's a web-server 
workload that spawns 1K+ client procs.  It can be emulated by using this:
  for i in `seq 1 to 3333`; do ping 10.1 -A > /dev/null & done
The problem is that consecutive runs don't give consistent results and 
sometimes stalls.  You may want to try that.
Thanks!
