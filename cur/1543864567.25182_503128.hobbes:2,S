   Well, you just need to make sure that a resume() actually is a visible
   event ...
Sorry, but I don't see the point. Visible to what? 
Mine problem here is that the input device doesn't care about suspend/resume
cycles (it is a straight char driver), probably because it doesn't need to (so
far.) Low-level drivers (kbd & co) on the contrary are all bus or platform
drivers, hooking directly into suspend/resume callbacks.
Do you mean that I should back-propagate a suspend/resume event from the
low-level drivers to the input one?
