Standardisation is good, but autotools (as they are used) usurally isn't. It
tests for the availability of a fortran compiler for a C-only project, checks
the width of integers on i386 for projects not caring about that and fails to
find installed libraries without telling how it was supposed to find them or
how to make it find that library.
Configuring the build of an autotools program is harder than nescensary;
if it used a config file, you could easily save it somewhere while adding
comments on how and why you did *that* choice, and you could possibly
use a set of default configs which you'd just include.
The Makefiles generated by autotools is a huge mess, if autotools got it
wrong (again!), fixing them requires editing a lot of files.
I'm really really happy if I read 'edit Makefile.conf and run make...'.
