Ok.

No, this is handled by fixing up the expected defines in the
	arch/xxx/Makefile
thing, ie x86 has this:
	CHECK := $(CHECK) -D__i386__=1
exactly because sparse is architecture-agnostic. Same goes for 64-bit 
issues (sparse defaults to 32-bit types regardless of what the native 
format is), so a 64-bit platform like ppc64 would do:
	CHECK := $(CHECK) -m64 -D__powerpc__=1
where that "-m64" is the magic flag to sparse for a 64-bit compile 
environment.
But your stdarg.h issue is certainly valid. I'd really like for sparse to 
be _totally_ independent of the native compiler install, and I guess we 
could do something like
	CHECK := $(CHECK) -I$(shell $(CC) -print-file-name=include)
or similar to get this part right too, but then sparse would be hard to 
use stand-alone without the Makefile magic. Hmm.
