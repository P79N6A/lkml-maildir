Well, it's probably going to have to *start* as root, or use something like 
sudo.  It's probably easiest to have it start as root and drop privileges as 
soon as possible, certainly before handling any untrusted data.

This is a very easy special case.  Just start a process for each user ID and 
drop root privileges.  They can communicate via sockets or even shared memory. 
If you wanted to switch between arbitrary UIDs at runtime, it might be worth 
doing something exotic, but it's really not in this case.  Also, if you do it 
this way, it's rather easy to verify the correctness of your design, and you 
never have to touch kernel code.

But you can already accomplish this with ACLs and SELinux.  You're trying to 
make this problem harder than it really is.

And do what with them?  You can already pass arbitrary data via sockets.  It 
sounds like you need (1) to use (2).

(1) doesn't accomplish anything you can't already do, but it would make a huge 
mess of a lot of code.
(2) is silly.  Sockets are for communicating between userspace processes.  If 
you want to be granting/revoking credentials, you should be using system calls, 
and even then only if you absolutely must.  Having the kernel snoop traffic on 
sockets between processes would be disastrous for performance, and without that, 
any process could claim that it had been granted privileges over a socket and 
the kernel would just have to trust it.
Don't overthink this.  You don't need to touch the kernel at all to do this. 
Just use a multi-process model, like qmail does, for example.  You can start 
with root privileges and drop them, or use sudo to help you out.  It's fast, 
secure, takes advantage of modern multi-core CPUs, and is much simpler.
