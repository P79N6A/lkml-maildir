If generic_file_direct_write() has fail (ENOSPC condition) inside 
__generic_file_aio_write_nolock() it may have instantiated
a few blocks outside i_size. And fsck will complain about wrong i_size
(ext2, ext3 and reiserfs interpret i_size and biggest block difference as error),
after fsck will fix error i_size will be increased to the biggest block,
but this blocks contain gurbage from previous write attempt, this is not 
information leak, but its silence file data corruption. This issue affect 
fs regardless the values of blocksize or pagesize.
We need truncate any block beyond i_size after write have failed , do in simular
generic_file_buffered_write() error path.
TEST_CASE:
open("/mnt/test/BIG_FILE", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_DIRECT, 0666) = 3
write(3, "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"..., 104857600) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device)
#stat /mnt/test/BIG_FILE

Yep..  my english is not realy good :(

Ohh, We can't just call vmtruncate() after generic_file_direct_write()
failure while __generic_file_aio_write_nolock() becase where is no guarantee
what i_mutex held. In fact all existing fs always invoke 
__generic_file_aio_write_nolock() with i_mutex held in case of S_ISREG files,
but this was't explicitly demanded and documented. I've proposed to do it in
previous versions of this patch, because it this just document current state
of affairs, but David Chinner wasn't agree with it.
