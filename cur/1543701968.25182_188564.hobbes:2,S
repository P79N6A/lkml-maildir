Yes, and it works reasonably well. I have version 012 here.
Some flaws will be fixed in 013 or so. Some difficulties are of a
more fundamental type, not so easy to fix. But udev is an entirely
different discussion. Some other time.

Of course. But this is not about naming.
The kernel invents device numbers, and user space names.
Now compare our setups:
dev_t lbt_devno(void) { return random(); }
dev_t aeb_devno(char *s) { dev_t d = hash(s); while (inuse(d)) d++; return d; }
An earlier fragment of the discussion was concerned with the fact
that random(); is a bad idea. Something reproducible is better.
Let us abbreviate the above function f. Some driver determines that
a disk has serial number A809ADGC. Another driver determines that
some device was produced by HP but otherwise has no opinion.
A third driver has no stable information at all about the device.
They assign device numbers f("A809ADGC"), f("HP"), f("").
What is the result? Yes, device numbers are cookies, but a reasonable
attempt has been made to make the device numbers stable.
No guarantees anywhere - this is best effort. Better than no effort.
And this information helps udev. It may make a callout superfluous,
or even give udev information that cannot be obtained from userspace.
