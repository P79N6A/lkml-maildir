Yes, I looked through the driver core related patches in -mm but wasn't
sure if there was a change to generic code which could affect
ieee1394/nodemgr.

(Is this infrastructure something which other subsystems will require
anyway? If not, maybe the ieee1394 subsystem's sysfs interface could be
cut to size instead.)

Good, I just wanted to hear your opinion before drilling further down.
Seems there is an older bug in nodemgr. But whatever it is, the reporter
reproduced it _only_ in -mm, with either of 2.6.19-rc-mm's and
2.6.19-rc's ieee1394 code. Time for me to let -mm loose on my PC.
