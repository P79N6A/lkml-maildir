You're right! I'll see if I can come up with a patch.
If this is done in scripts/kallsyms.c, there is less code needed in the 
actual kernel, and there is no time penalty on the first lookup. This is 
a true win-win scenario :)
Thanks a lot for your suggestion.

Well, I only left in the resulting source code the pieces that I 
actually measured to be a significant improvment.
The thing is, this is not exactly a cache.
The problem that the markers address is that the decompression must be 
done sequentially.
If I have 20000 symbols and already figured out from the binary search 
that I need symbol 11201 (for instance), I would have to go through 
11201 symbols to get to the symbol I need.
The algorithm I wrote keeps markers in the middle of the stream, so that 
when I try to fetch symbol 11201, I already know where symbol 10000 is 
because of the marker and only have to go through 1201 symbols.
With N markers you get N times the speed on the name search. (actually 
this is not exactly right for high values of N, because you can only use 
a marker that is a 0 stem, but for N<~32 this is a good approximation)
