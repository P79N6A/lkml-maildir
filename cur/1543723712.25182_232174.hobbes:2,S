Got confused.

Some do.  On my test box 1000-odd /proc inodes get allocated and fully
freed on each `ls -R /proc'.  65 /proc inodes are freed during `ls -lR
/proc/net'.  So maybe it isn't working completely.
But proc_notify_change() copies the inode's uid, gid and mode into the
proc_dir_entry, so they get correctly initialised when the inode is
reinstantiated, so afaict we have no bug here.
