Thanks, but do you happen to know anything besides english? Quite a few
languages differentiate meaning by case sometimes, german is an example
(the ambiguity is easily resolved, but still there is).
However, the biggest problem is that the kernel does not have a
well-defined definition of "case" at all. It works for english, maybe for
german, but it does not work for devengari.
