Strict overcommit is there for shared mappings.  When private mapping
support was added, people agreed that full overcommit should apply to
private mappings for the same reasons normal page overcommit is desired.
For one: an application using lots of private huge pages should not be
prohibited from forking if it's likely to just exec a small helper
program.
"These faults" are happening in two cases when MAP_PRIVATE huge pages
are being used:
1) Fault on an uninstantiated huge page: This can happen when numerous
users of huge pages in the system are competing for a finite number of
huge pages.  Even if the process checks for free huge pages before
mmaping the area, another process is free to "steal" those pages out
from under the careful process.
2) COW fault on an instantiated huge page:  Happens in child processes
who inherit a private hugetlb region and write to it.
Both of these cases are non-deterministic and should be handled in some
way.  Just killing the process doesn't seem like a permanent solution to
me.
