It will break _many_ things - my intention is to find a
solution for ld.so that won't break things at all. The
current solution (the hack that makes mmap(PROT_EXEC) to
fail on a "noexec" mounts) breaks just too much and doesn't
solve the problem of executing the files without an exec perm.
But your idea about playing with the flags is interesting.
What if the currently-unused MAP_EXECUTABLE flag became a
way for the program to express that it needs an exec perm,
and so the mmap should fail if there is none? I think ld.so
will be happy using such a flag...
