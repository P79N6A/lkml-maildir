I'm missing the "in the case of sparc" clause.  The sparc (and maybe others?)
have to keep the firmware image in memory in the case that it needs to reload
the sequencer.  The initrd simply adds more tool-chains to keep up-to-date.
Any distribution supporting the Qlogic,FC will have to supply a firmware file
in binary form to initialize the card.  And then you're right back to square
one in the binary distribution arena.
