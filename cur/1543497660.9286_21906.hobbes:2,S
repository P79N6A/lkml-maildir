2.2.9 is really bad for running apache and other buffer-consuming
programs.
Try:
% cat some_large_file_that_does_not_fit_in_RAM > /dev/null
and you will see your apache daemons swapped out. It depends more on
buffering than in MaxClients.
The behaviour in 2.2.7 was much better for this case. I already reported
it days ago.
