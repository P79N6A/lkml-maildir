My point is: it's just a heuristic number.  It currently reflects the
number on the runqueue, but there's no reason it *has to* (except the
name, of course).
1) The nr_running() function can use rq->active->nr_active +
   rq->expired->nr_active.  And anyway it's only as "am I
   idle?".
2) The test inside schedule() can be replaced by checking the result
   of the sched_find_first_zero_bit() (I have a patch which does this
   to good effect, but for other reasons).
The other uses of nr_running are all "how long is this runqueue for
rebalancing", and Ingo *already* modifies his use of this number,
using the "prev_nr_running" hack.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
