Subject: autofs4 patch: autofs4_wait can leak memory

Hi,
There is a memory in the autofs4_wait function, if multiple processes are
waiting on the same queue:
	name = kmalloc(NAME_MAX + 1, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!name)
		return -ENOMEM;
	...
	if ( !wq ) {
		/* Create a new wait queue */
		wq = kmalloc(sizeof(struct autofs_wait_queue), GFP_KERNEL);
		if ( !wq ) {
			kfree(name);
			up(&sbi->wq_sem);
			return -ENOMEM;
		}
		...
		wq->name = name;
		...
	} else {
		atomic_inc(&wq->wait_ctr);
		up(&sbi->wq_sem);
		...
       }
In the else clause, we forget to free the name we kmalloc'd above.  This is
pretty easy to trigger with the following reproducer:
setup an automount map as follows:
for n in `seq 1 48`; do echo "$n server:/export/$n" >> /etc/auto.test; done
setup a master map entry to point at this:
echo "/test /etc/auto.test --timeout=1" >> /etc/auto.master
Now, assuming the nfs server was setup to export said directories, run the
following shell script in two xterms:
#!/bin/sh
while true; do
        for n in `seq 1 48`; do
                ls /test/$n
        done
        sleep 2
done
and watch the size-256 slab cache grow
Within 4 minutes, I had the size-256 cache grow to 384k.  On a kernel with
the below patch applied, the size-256 remained constant during an over-night
run.
The patch is against linux-2.6.9, but it applies to 2.6.11, as well.
