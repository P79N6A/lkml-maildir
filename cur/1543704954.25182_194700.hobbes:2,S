Ok, this looks like random garbage has gotten written into inode table.  
If you can make this happen consistently with 2.6 and not with 2.4,
then that would be useful to know.  There may be some kind of race
condition or problem with either the raid5 code, or the combination of
raid5 plus ext3.  It's unlikely this kind of error would be caused by
a flaw in the ext3 code alone, since this is indicative of complete
garbage written to the inode table, or a block intended for another
location on disk getting written to the inode table.  The natural
suspect is at the block device layer and below.
