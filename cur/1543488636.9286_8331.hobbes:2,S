You can do very well. Start your IO early and asynchronously, so that it
completes just as you need the code/data. The OS can not predict this.

You can tune your program to be DSM-friendly by clustering your
access to the DSM. Much of that happens semi-automatically by the
way people write code. (you don't usually access totally unrelated
data -- if you do, nothing will save you)

So people should just be happy writing new code, since it _might_ be
very slow? That could be an expensive waste of time.
I'm sick of seeing this:
"Our way is the only way."
"You must throw out your inferior code. Do not attempt to reuse it."
"There must not be any possible performance loss, even if you don't care."
"We write manly code. You write girly code."
"Everyone must write kick-ass code, whether they need it or not."
"DSM is a sin. Sinners must repent!"
"Those that don't use every last cycle are idiots that must be saved."
