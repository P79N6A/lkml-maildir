Is there anything other than TiVOization to justify these statements?
Also, can you elaborate on what you mean about 'giving back in kind'?
(I suspect this is related with the tit-for-tat reasoning, that you've
failed to elaborate on before)
The only thing the GPL demands is respect for others' freedoms, as in,
"I, the author, respect your freedoms, so you, the licensee, must
respect others' freedoms as well".  Is this the "in kind" you're
talking about?  Or are you mistaken about the actual meaning of even
GPLv2?
