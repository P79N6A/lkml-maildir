Preliminary Linux Key Infrastructure 0.01-alpha1:
I'm writing a key/keyring infrastructure for the Linux kernel. I've got 
some of the
basic infrastructure done, and I'd like any comments on it that you may 
have.
Please note that as yet none of this has been even compile tested, it 
has
errors galore, and is still very incomplete.  I have only worked on the 
in-kernel
parts of the infrastructure, user-space interfaces and keyctl are on my 
TODO
list. :-D
See below for my current status:
That said, here's a link:
http://www.tjhsst.edu/~kmoffett/lki.tar.bz2
Completed:
	lki_key_t & methods
		A simple key, with a description and a BLOB
	lki_keytype_t & methods
		A module-registered key type description including callbacks
	lki_key_hash_{add,remove,search}
		Lookup up keys by number
In Progress:
	lki_keyring_blob_t & methods
		A special-case of a key. Just needs add and remove key methods
	permissions model
		On hold while I learn more about POSIX ACLs and stuff
	lki_key_handle_t
		This is my next task, it is barely started
TODO:
	keyctl:
		The syscall that makes it all possible
	keyfs:
		keys by number: On hold while I learn more about filesystems :-D
	libinuxkeys:
		A user-space library linked using "gcc -linuxkeys" :-D
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
