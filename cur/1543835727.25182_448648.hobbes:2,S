Yes, that is true, and I think that's a big motivator for the reiser
team to get reiser4 in a place where people can't say that.  I suspect
that they know that reiserfs's shortcomings in that respect are probably
the biggest deterrent to using that fs, and they'll do everything they
can to prevent such a problem in reiser4.  That's pure conjecture based
on the stuff I see on the list, so if I'm wrong, reiser people, please
correct me.
