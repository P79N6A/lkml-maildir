Quit talking shit. I go through a lot of effort to merge in changes sent
to Linus' tree into the Linux1394 repo. I don't just dump changes for no
good reason.
How about pointing out some specifics? Maybe make my job easier by
getting me some patches directly. Trying to track two seperate source
tree's isn't as easy as you might think.
