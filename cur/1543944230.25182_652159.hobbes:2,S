Explaining it won't make it pretty, but at least I can tell you what the code 
does.
This is all part of the btrfs code that supports tree block sizes larger than 
a page.  The extent_buffer code (extent_io.c) provides a read/write api into 
an extent_buffer based on offsets from the start of the multi-page buffer.  
That's where the relative unsigned long comes from.
The part where I cast it to pointers is me trying to maintain type checking 
throughout the code.  The pointers themselves are useless, they need to be 
matched with an extent_buffer to actually get to the bytes.
There are a few parts where the SETGET funcs are open coded, mostly in very 
performance critical functions.  Just look for lexxx_to_cpu

Btree blocks have the offset of the item header from the start of the block 
and the offset of the item data.  And, I'm very bad at naming.
