Well we have received a few comments from various people, so I would say
that it has been reviewed. You appeared to be happy with the iflags.h
header file which was the last set of comments that I have from you I
think. I'm sorry if we've missed something along the way but I hope
we've been quite careful to address all the issues.
My comments regarding 2.6.19 were due to one particular aspect of the
unlink() call which wasn't quite right. I didn't think at the time I
wrote that message that we'd be ready for this merge window, however
since Linus then went through a final -rc release, there was in fact
time to deal with this. I did post a follow up to clarify that a little
while back, so I'm sorry if it was a bit confusing,
Steve.
