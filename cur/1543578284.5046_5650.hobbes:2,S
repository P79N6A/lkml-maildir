Hi,
I don't really understand what you mean with "a process to pretending a
functional network interface". If you are looking for a way to have
something
that looks like a network interface without real hardware, you should
look at "dummy" module.
On ma machine, I use:
ifconfig dummy0 192.168.1.1 up
to set up such an interface.
Hope this helps
