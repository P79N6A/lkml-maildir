Hello lkml, hello Ingo!
I've been using CFS-v10 for a few days and I must say that I'm verry 
impressed ;-)
Desktop performance without any manual renicing is excellent, even with 
make -j20. Gaming performance is at least on par with SD now! I've tried to 
change the sched_load_smoothing config to "8" but there is no visible 
difference when it's set to "7".
Both schedulers are verrry good! I can't really tell which one is better.
I noticed that while compiling a kernel (with -j4) my CPU temperature is two 
to three degrees hotter than with mainline. I have not done any timing tests, 
but I suspect that it's a little faster while preserving excellent desktop 
usability. Great work!! :-)
