Fortunately that predates a lot of changes where I did address all those. 
These will seem out of context without looking at that original email so I 
apologise in advance.
buffered_rmqueue and prefetching x86 specific (not into DMA) were dropped
It is NUMA aware
Global cacheline bouncing in page allocation and page reclaim paths I have no 
answer for as I have to tell swap prefetch that the vm is busy somehow and I 
do that by setting precisely one bit in a lockless manner.
The trylocks were dropped.
The other ideas were to :
-extend the prefetching. That's extra features
-knowing for sure when a system is really idle. I've tried hard to do that as 
cheaply as possible.
-putting pages on the lru? well it puts them on the tail
-papering over an issue? As I said, no matter how good the vm is, there will 
always be loads that swap.
