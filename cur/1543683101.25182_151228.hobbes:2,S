Power Management and System Configuration

I think this is concernd with mainboard's main bus only (i2c is an aux
mainboard bus and usb, firewire are device busses)

i would suggest to have the section separated into system internal stuff
(cpu, mainboard bus, management bus, memory, apci, ..) and external
interfaces (usb, firewire, legacy/serial/, legacy/parallel, legacy/ps2,
...)
