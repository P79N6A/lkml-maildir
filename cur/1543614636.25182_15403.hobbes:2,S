Thanks, that's helpful.  I'll introduce an ISA_SLOTS private symbol, then.
Later perhaps we can actually make this distinction in C code;  sounds
like it would be a good idea.

The biggest hypocrites on gun control are those who live in upscale
developments with armed security guards -- and who want to keep other
people from having guns to defend themselves.  But what about
lower-income people living in high-crime, inner city neighborhoods?
Should such people be kept unarmed and helpless, so that limousine
liberals can 'make a statement' by adding to the thousands of gun laws
already on the books?"
