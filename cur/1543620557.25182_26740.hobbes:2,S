This is a good point...
'bk pull' is probably most useful to high volume submitters, where the
contents of most patches is either obvious and/or uninteresting.  'bk
send -d -r<rev> -' should be fine for importing.
But this is still a trial run of BK, so who knows what will wind up to
be the best policy for casual submitters.
And there's nothing wrong at all with sending GNU patches...
