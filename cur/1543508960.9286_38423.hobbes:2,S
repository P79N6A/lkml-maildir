I must be going numb in the head. Not only did I mail the wrong text
file (I had run the oops through ksymoops, I just attached the wrong
file) I also didn't enable the USB irq in the BIOS (I always forget
'cos Windows seems to work fine without it). It probably shouldn't
oops if there is no IRQ allocated for it though.
vidcat didn't work after I enabled the IRQ, but I see from the CPiA ml
that you already know about that.
One other question I have, I use the kernel bttv driver for my TV
card. However, the cam gets detected first and nabs /dev/video0. How
can I configure v4l to let me change the order of the devices? If I
can't do that, how can I access the cam and the TV card at once?
Cheers,
