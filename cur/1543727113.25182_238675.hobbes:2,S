Subject: [2.6.8-rc2-bk] New read/write bug in FAT fs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

One of the changesets posted by Linus on August 2 introduced
a bug in the FAT fs:
Even when a fat32 fs is mounted read-write I now get error
messages claiming the fs is 'read-only' when I try to write
to it.
The only change I can see which fits the timing is to inode.c
which was posted on August 2.  Apologies if I am blaming
the wrong changeset.
Could someone confirm this bug for me?
Thanks!
