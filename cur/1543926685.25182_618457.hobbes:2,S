The problem is that you have thrown away the main tool for documenting
the requirement, and for enforcing correctness (i.e. function argument
checking by the compiler).
The old functions are still there, are still exported, and still take
the same arguments as before, but you have now added a hidden
requirement that I have to set last_vfsmount when I call them. If I
haven't read your patch, and just call one of those vfs_* functions as
before, without setting last_vfsmount, I break your model, and I won't
find out until someone reports an obscure bug at runtime.
