Thanks, Zwane.
I've never seen this.  I assume the box is SMP since you are hitting a
BUG in the spin_unlock code?  I almost want to think this is an SMP bug
(locking rules not being observed somewhere) and preemption is just
accelerating the race.
Ohh wait - this is 2.5.6-pre3 ?
Can you try 2.5.6 final (or anything later)?  There is a bug with SMP
and preempt and this could be it.  Let me know..
