I have a machine that reaches OOM with 3 days of uptime.  You can watch
swap space grow as the day passes and ends up eating all swap after about 3
days.  According to ps the processes are only using about 100 or so megs of
swap to where the system eats up over 500 megs.
This has been a problem that I have been having for over a month now and
it's really an issue with me now.
Any ideas?
