- I think it is better to move forward rather then back.
- The old proc dentry caching behavior is actually too aggressive, and has
  problem corner cases.  Keeping the dentries when we have something mounted
  on top is a trade off that is the least of two evils.
- My change fixes the mount leak on all of /proc not just on /proc/generic.
What you did is a hack that restored the old slightly buggy behavior.  Which
is fine if we can't find anything better.  It is not code that is on the
path towards a /proc that properly caches it's dentries.
With the old behavior a random user space application can open a file or
a directory in /proc pinning it's dcache entry.  Then the module supplying
that open file can be removed and reinserted.  Until the user space application
removes reference to that /proc file all you will be able to find is the
version of the file from before /proc was removed.
That sounds like a way to trigger nasty behavior to me.  I would like
to remove that possibility from the kernel if I can.
