ie. if the binary anywhere has code that does:
	system("/bin/sh")
then this address can be jumped to and an exploit becomes possible. Also,
in the case of non-ASCII overflows the attacker has a much higher degree
of freedom to create a proper stackframe.
wrt. address-space randomization, "prelink -R" already provides quite good
randomization of the shared library addresses, which should give some
statistical protection against remote attacks, i dont think we'll need
kernel support for that.
