So this is the bug, isn't it?  Can the calibrate_delay stuff be moved
until _after_ the bit has been set in smp_commenced_mask??

Maybe you could copy the boot cpu's calibrate_delay result
over to all cpu_possible secondaries, then redo the calibration
for real once the secondary is actually legally up and running.
