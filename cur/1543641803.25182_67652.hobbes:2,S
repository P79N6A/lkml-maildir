In b() t is a const value and you're trying to assign to it,
and in c() and e() t is a pointer-to-const and you're trying
to assign to *t. The compiler catches this. What's the problem?

void g(int * const t) { *t = 0; }

There is no difference. Read the C spec, or Harbison&Steele
which has had an explanation of 'const' since their '87 2nd Ed.
