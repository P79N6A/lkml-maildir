Does it have to be linux?  I've been playing with Arduino boards
(
http://www.adafruit.com
) lately and they have ethernet modules,
serial libraries, etc.  All on a small small chip.  Well, the ethernet
is a daughter board, but they're still pretty small.  
Depends on how general purpose you need to make this device and what
you're trying to accomplish.  Maybe you need to give people a better
idea of what you're trying to do, instead of assuming you need Linux
and trying to shoe-horn it into a really tiny space.
Cheers,
