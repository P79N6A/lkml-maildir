Subject: [PATCH 1/6] x86: fix NX bit handling in change_page_attr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch fixes a bug of change_page_attr/change_page_attr_addr on
Intel i386/x86_64 CPUs.  After changing page attribute to be
executable with these functions, the page remains un-executable on
Intel i386/x86_64 CPU.  Because on Intel i386/x86_64 CPU, only if the
"NX" bits of all three level page tables are cleared (PAE is enabled),
the corresponding page is executable (refer to section 4.13.2 of Intel
64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual).  So, the bug
is fixed through clearing the "NX" bit of PMD when splitting the huge
PMD.
