Huh? That can't be right. Every cd burner this side of the 21st century has 
buffer underrun protection. I've burnt cds _while_ capturing and encoding 
video using truckloads of cpu and I/O without superuser privileges, had all 
the cdrecord warnings and didn't have a buffer underrun. Last time I gave 
superuser privilege to cdrecord it locked my machine - clearly it wasn't 
rt_task safe.
