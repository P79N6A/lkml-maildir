What if the 'internal' share was Coda, not NFS? Because of the local cache,
that'd improve performance, and would give some approximation of service
even if the main server went down. Writes to the filesystem while the central 
server was down wouldn't be propagated between the two relay hosts, though, 
and may cause conflicts when they were eventually written back to the main 
server. I don't know how Coda handles that.
If the filesystems to be shared were read-only, you could just use software 
RAID and nbd, and mount them on all the server hosts. But that doesn't work 
when the filesystems are read-write. 
Perhaps what we need is a filesystem that can be written concurrently by many
different hosts? Unfortunately, I don't think it's even possible to build the
necessary synchronisation primitives with our current block device hardware. 
We could enforce block device access for these filesystems to be _only_ through
nbd, and not allow direct access to disks which happen to be local, or on a 
shared SCSI bus. This would allow us to build in synchronisation primitives at 
the nbd layer. Would that be enough?
Alternatively, we can have such a cluster always elect a single host to be the
'writer', and ensure that the filesystem is always in a coherent state (cf.
JFS). Read requests are served straight from the block device(s), and write
requests are forwarded to the 'writer'. If the writer goes down, another
election is held and a new writer is selected.
