I already said it in mail to Rik:
Yes - you can run out of vmalloc space. But you run out of it only when
you create too many processes (8192), load too many modules etc. If
someone needs to put such heavy load on linux, we can expect that he is
not a luser and he knows how to increase size of vmalloc space.
But - you run out of high-order pages randomly. You don't have to overflow
any resource - just map a file, touch it whole the first time and then
periodically touch every second page of it. Or: alloc periodically one
anon page and one cache page - read() (without readahead) does exactly
that.
You can't run out of vmalloc space just by mapping files and touching
pages. 
The probability math is fine - only if you are sure that pages are
allocated and freed randomly. But they are not.
