FWIW I have similar problem with Toshiba Portege 4000. Every second reboot 
keyboard is not there. It is really not there - i.e. I cannot even enter BIOS 
setup or boot menu.
This is not limited to Linux - I had exactly the same problem when WinXP was 
on this system.
As in other cases, disabling ACPI helps in this particular case but as this 
system does not have APM it is not a real option.
While I am not very bothered by this problem (I just took habit to switch 
system off instead of reboot - it takes exactly the same amount of time 
because reboot seems to *do* switch off and then on) I am open to any 
suggestion how to debug the issue,
Adding i8042.nomux did not help BTW.
