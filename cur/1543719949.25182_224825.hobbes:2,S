Hi,
Sorry to not be part of the mailing list and ask question. Please,
could you post any answer (CC) to this question, if relevant ? Many
TIA.
I've got a kernel already installed in my machine (SuSe Pro 9). I would
like to modify something and recompile the kernel. Since it has been
installed from rpm, there is no .config in /usr/src/linux. Is there any
way to create this file from the image and modules, so i do not need to
verify all my config prior to change something ?
Thx
