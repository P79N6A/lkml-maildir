I'm afraid a lot of this, like the CPUID changes, are fairly pointless
because they are  __cpuinit code anyways. This means (unless you compiled
a kernel with CPU hotplug support enabled) it will be all freed after
boot.

The important part is not how big the vmlinux is, but how much
memory is actually used after boot. 
I expect concentrating some of the dynamic data structures would
be more fruitful in fact.
