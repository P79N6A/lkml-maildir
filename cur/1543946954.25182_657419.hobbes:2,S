Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: make amd quad core 8 socket system not be clustered_box
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

quad core 8 socket system will have apic id lifting.the apic id range could
be [4, 0x23]. or [8, 0x27]. apic_is_clustered_box will think that need to three clusters
and that is large than 2. So it is treated as clustered_box.
and will get
Marking TSC unstable due to TSCs unsynchronized
even the CPUs have X86_FEATURE_CONSTANT_TSC set.
this patch offset back the apic before get apic clusterid.
or use dmi to get apic_is_clustered?
