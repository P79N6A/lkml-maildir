So I still don't understand what is really happening here.
I left my build script running overnight ... working on a
kernel at the 357d596bd... commit (where Linus merged in
my tree last night).  This one has your "archprepare" patch
already included.
Sometimes a build for a config succeeds, and sometimes it
fails. (tiger_defconfig for the last six builds has had a
GOOD, BAD, BAD, BAD, GOOD, GOOD sequence, while bigsur_defconfig
went GOOD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD).  This non-determinism
doesn't fit in well with your explanation of missing defines
for PAGE_SIZE etc.
