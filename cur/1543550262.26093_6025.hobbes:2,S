The patch assumes that all threads have the same pgrp (may be not true)
When other threads do not actually coredump or have the same pgrp then 
the tcore structure will never be cleaned up as far as I can see, allowing 
a nice DoS attack of filling your memory completely. 
There was also another patch from Philip Gladstone for 2.2 BTW which did the same
thing, but also had various problems. It worked around that particular trap by
implementing the killing of other threads in kernel space (which is fine for Linux
Threads, but limits other otherwise useful applications of clone threads). I think
it had some other problems too.
