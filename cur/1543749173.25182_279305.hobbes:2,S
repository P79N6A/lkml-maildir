What's the chip? Radeon IGP by any chance, as these are shared memory
chips I wonder have we missed something in the drm... also what X
release....
Nothing obvious is jumping out at me from the code that is in that
tree, it was with -mm I'd wonder but with stock kernel there is
nothing that should have changed greatly...
