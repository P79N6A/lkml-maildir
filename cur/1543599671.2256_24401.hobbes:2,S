Well, you're right that without network connection, there's not much
useful you can do.  However, LCS and QETH are not the only options;
you can also use a CTC or IUCV network interface (and those drivers *are*
open source and in the tree); there's also a third-party open source driver
to access CLAW network devices (not in the official tree, but e.g. part of
the SuSE kernel).
Especially in a virtual machine, you can simply define a virtual CTC or
IUCV
connection and access your network via those devices.
If you are running Linux native on the S/390 (not in a virtual machine)
and have *only* physical LCS or QETH devices, you must use the binary-only
modules; but this doesn't appear to be fundamentally different from other
devices where only binary drivers exist ...
Mit freundlichen Gruessen / Best Regards
