With 2.6.13-rc4-RT-V0.7.52-02 (the oldest version I still have around) I
still can't build that config, but it fails with:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
net/built-in.o: In function `rt_check_expire':
route.c:(.text+0x1a66a): undefined reference to `__bad_spinlock_type'

make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
AFAICT all the realtime-preempt patches have references to
__bad_spinlock_type but none of them ever define it - I can't figure out
what's going on.
I'll try to build something older.
