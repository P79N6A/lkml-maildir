Hello,   
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting the fund transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Paraguay. Presently I'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. 
Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.
Now you will need to contact the former personal secretary to the Rev. father as at the time i was in Dakar Senegal, her name is Mrs.Rita Isu and her direct email address is : (rittaisu1@yahoo.co.uk) 
Ask her to kindly send you a certified bank draft of $300.000.00 which I prepared and kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter which later failed. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. 
so feel free and get in touched with Mrs Rita and direct her where to send/post you the bank draft Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the our joy after all the sufferings at that time. 
In the moment, I am very busy here because of the investment projects which myself and my new partner are having at hand. 
Remember that I had forwarded this instruction to her on your behalf, therefore establish contacts with her for the delivery of the bank draft to you without delay. 
Take care and remain Blessed.
Yours truly
Rose Sankoh
