For changedfiles, using cut n' paste sys_getcwd, we've
managed to get "good enough" functionality.  When a
user runs "touch foo" in /tmp/watch, when we intercept
the  openw, we manage to resolve "foo" to
"/tmp/watch/foo".   We still break on things like 
"touch ../../foo", since we resolve that to
"/tmp/watch/../../foo"  -- but that's pretty fixable  
with a little effort.
NFS mounted filesystems still get us, since we rely on
intercepting the system calls and putting a wrapper
around them.  I've looked into doing so, but I didn't
see a way of doing so in a module -- and we haven't
wanted to demand that users patch and rebuild a
kernel.
