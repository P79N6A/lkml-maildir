I'm noticing some strangeness, with APM, and 2.2.5.
This may have happened in 2.2.3, I'm unsure, I don't think so in 2.2.0.
Sometimes my machine (cts5100 DEC p100 laptop) will get into a state, where
it won't properly reset the clock after a suspend/resume cycle.
I have APM compiled in, and the correct define.
I also get no message from APMD, logging that suspend/resume cycle,
or any standby/resume cycles.
Also, the IDE driver can get really upset, if a pcmcia drive is spun down,
and the pcmcia controller turned off, as there is no way to unmount it.
Also, what I suspect to be a problem with my understanding, I'd like
apmd to log battery going down, in syslog. It doesn't seem to want to,
even with the appropriate switches.
