What is the Oracle requirement in detail?
If it's for access to hugetlbfs then there are the uid= and gid= mount
options.
If it's for access to SHM_HUGETLB then there was some discussion about
extending the uid= thing to shm, but nothing happened.  This could be
resurrected.
If it's just generally for the ability to mlock lots of memory then
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK would be preferable.  I don't see why we'd need the sysctl
when `ulimit -m' is available?  (Where is that patch btw?)

Using the security framework is neat.  There are currently large spinlock
contention problems in avc_has_perm_noaudit() which I suspect will make
SELinux problematic in some server environments.  But I trust it is
possible to disable SELinux in config while using Bill's security module?
I guess we could live with sysctl which simply nukes CAP_IPC_LOCK, but it
has to be the when-all-else-failed option, yes?
