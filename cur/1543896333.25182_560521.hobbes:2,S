just for the question on the HOWTO (not on anything else)
You can easily have scrambled streams with regards to DVB, eg: using
EN50221. Some (like NDS for example in _some_ instances) use proprietary
schemes, but there are standards based methods also. eg: Common
Scrambling Algorithm (CSA)
But in any case, this can be broken down too .. :-)
