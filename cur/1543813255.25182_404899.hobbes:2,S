I see. But that is easy to fix.  I just need to do exactly the same
thing as what you did to alloc_huge_page.  I will then need to change
definition of 'reservation' to needs-in-the future (also an easy thing
to change).
The real question or discussion I want to bring up is whether kernel
should do it's own accounting or relying on traversing the page cache. 
My opinion is that kernel should do it's own accounting because it is
simpler: you just need to do that at mmap and ftruncate time.
