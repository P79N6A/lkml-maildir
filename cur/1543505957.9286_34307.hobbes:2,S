Exactly. Someone else agrees with me.
Oh, since you work for creative labs, any chance of getting DVD support from you
guys soon?
According to the guys at creative technical support (the one in Ireland that
everyone in the UK and Ireland goes through to), it would be best for me to "wait
for someone to reverse engineer our code than to wait for a driver" - that was very
honest now wasn't it? :) (probably, he'dbe fired very quickly if they knew). Any
official comment?
