I have rebased to -linus, but I'm a bit scared about making that
particular change at this time, mostly because it requires some
additional Makefile work which I would be happier to apply later, in
order to make the "create clean patchset" task easier.
All the source code is shared, but for right now the Makefiles are
slightly different, mostly w.r.t. CFLAGS.
