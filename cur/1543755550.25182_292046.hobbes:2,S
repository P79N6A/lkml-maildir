and how do you force a program to call that function and then to execute
your shellcode? In other words: i challenge you to show a working
(simulated) exploit on Fedora (on the latest fc4 devel version, etc.) 
that does that. 
You can simulate the overflow itself so no need to find any real
application vulnerability, but show me _working code_ (or a convincing
description) that can call glibc's do_make_stack_executable() (or the
'many ways of doing this'), _and_ will end up executing your shell code
as well.
if you can do this i fully accept there's a problem.
