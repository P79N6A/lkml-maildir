Subject: USB for printer
Hi all,
I would like to know how can I print something out to the local printer via
USB.  I have insmod the usblp.o and printer.o, but when I tried to print a
testpage to the printer then I received the following message:
Error printing test page to queue lp
Error reason: lpr:connect: No such file
or directory jobs queued, but cannot start daemon.
