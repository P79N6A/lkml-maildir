Quoting David Howells (dhowells@redhat.com):

>      The minimum number of threads that should be in the pool as long as it is
>      in use.  This may be anywhere between 2 and max-threads.

>      The maximum number of threads that should in the pool.  This may be
>      anywhere between min-threads and 255 or NR_CPUS * 2, whichever is greater.
> 
>  (*) /proc/sys/kernel/slow-work/vslow-percentage
> 
>      The percentage of active threads in the pool that may be used to execute
>      very slow work items.  This may be between 1 and 99.  The resultant number
>      is bounded to between 1 and one fewer than the number of active threads.
>      This ensures there is always at least one thread that can process very
>      slow work items, and always at least one thread that won't.
