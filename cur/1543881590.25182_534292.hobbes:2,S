I wonder how the guest domain can be denied timer interrupts for such a
long time ? The only reason I see is that the guest domain is not
scheduled at all (host domain or another higher priority guest running).
Now in SMP host and guest, what happens if a guest CPU is not scheduled
for a while ?
An example: in kernel/pid.c:alloc_pid(), if one of the guest CPUs is
descheduled when holding the pidmap_lock, what happens to the other
guest CPUs who want to alloc/free pids ? Are they blocked too ?
