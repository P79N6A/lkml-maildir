Let's just postulate that my claim that this is harder than it looks is
true.  You don't have to agree with it, just pretend you do.  Given that,
it's going to be a while before any alternative shows up.  People mumble
about arch until they go use it for a while and realize it is about 3-5
years behind BK.  Linus isn't about to step backwards that far.

No kidding.  Do you have any suggestions, _realistic_ suggestions, that 
we could do to help?  Beyond making plain text patches/tarballs available
from every repo hosted on bkbits?
