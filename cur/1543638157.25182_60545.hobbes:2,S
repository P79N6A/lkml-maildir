Actually there is one more case, where the BIOS unreliably tells you
something has changed. I have an old Toshiba which I bought with Windows
installed, and it always noticed pulling the plug and going line=>battery,
but only sometimes noticed battery=>line. Of course this might be an o/s
bug. Can't test that any more, the battery failed and the transition is
now line=>dead.
Anyway, if you are paranoid you could just ignore the "I knew that" cases
and leave the workaround in place, unless that would generate other
issues.
