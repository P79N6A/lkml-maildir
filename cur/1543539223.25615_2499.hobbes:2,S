Subject: Linux SMP performance vs. UP: not a laurel

UP PII333 overclocked to 412MHz, 512MB memory:
   24/7 one setiathome <8hr 45min constant
UP PII450 512MB memory, production machine:
   24/7 one setiathome <8hr 10min constant
UP PIII550 512 MB memory, no load:
   24/7 one setiathome <7hr 00min _VERY_ constant
All UP's 2.2.16, glibc-2.1.3, gcc-2.95.2, base SuSE 6.4.
SMP 2xPIII550 1GB memory, mostly unloaded:
24/7 _TWO_ setiathome running, time for the single seti:
    2.2.7,  libc5, gcc-2.7.2.3, base SuSE 6.1:
            <8hr 50min, inconstant with values <7hr 50min
    2.2.14, glibc-2.1.1, gcc-2.95, base SuSE 6.3:
            >9hr 15min, inconstant with values >10hr 10min
    2.2.16, glibc-2.1.3, gcc-2.95.2, base SuSE 6.4:
            same as for 2.2.14, with some stategies like
            memtest before/after setiathome starting,
            mmap002, connections via ethernet 10M/RG-58,
            telnet from other machines, find | cpio to tape
            and others not noted, the time goes down:
            <9hr 20min, but never constant as with the UP's.
    2.4.0-test3 after reboot (sic!) >10hr 45min !!!
Now the SMP runs 2.2.16, I need it compatible for work.
Any _REAL_ and usable explication?
==================================
Willing to use the SMP for tests with seti.
Not in list, only reader & UNIX sysadm/usr since AT&T SVR2.
