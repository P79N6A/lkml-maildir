I wrote a SAMPLE CODE - Hello.S to work for a cross-assembler mips-linux-as - but this is giving me an error message:
   ".data 
         quest: .asciiz "Hello World!"
    .text
    _start:
         la $a0, quest
         li $v0, 4
         syscall   "
The error messages are:
  " Hello.S line 5: illegal operands 'la' 
    Hello.S line 6: illegal operands 'li'"
Can anyone help? What is wrong?
