 It may not be related, but out of five boot attempts, only one got past
the IDE driver stage(ie, below from 2.4.2 :
  VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
  VP_IDE: chipset revision 16
  VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
  ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
  idebus=xx
  VP_IDE: VIA vt82c596b (rev 23) IDE UDMA66 controller on pci00:07.1
      ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
      ide1: BM-DMA at 0xe008-0xe00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA)
  I've had 2.4.2 running great for the past 10 days. Need any more info?
