Users can go to anyone they like to get it fixed. It is more than just
"fix it yourself". I can buy Linux from a distributor, hit an annoying problem
they say "we cant fix", and I can email you and say "This bugs me, give me a
quote to fix it"
Its a freedom to get things fixed, changed, improved - and to distribute the
result. In the technical community it was always seen as "fix it yourself"
In the business community it is seen much more as multi-sourced support
and maintenance.
