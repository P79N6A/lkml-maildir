And the exact same thing can be done with ASCII, too - only easier.

I consider those cycles *very* well spent. Being able to use those common  
tools is rather important to very many people.
Let's write a /proc ASCII coding rules document. It should document well a  
few (*very* few) generic formats to use for new entries, and big fat  
warnings about ever changing the format of existing tables, and it should  
be easy to find in /Documentation/ - and we should immediately jump on  
anyone who violates it without, in advance, discussing the problem he's  
trying to solve, and convincing us that they can't be solved any other  
way.
I don't much care how those formats look, as long as they're easy to parse  
and to extend compatibly, and *few*.
