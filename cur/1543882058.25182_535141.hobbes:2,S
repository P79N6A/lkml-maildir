Hi Fernando,
How much is the performance penalty? Is it really significant. My point
is that, to me changing apic_wait_icr_dle() itself seems to be the simple
approach instead of introducing another function.
Original implementation is:
static __inline__ void apic_wait_icr_idle(void)
{
	while (apic_read(APIC_ICR) & APIC_ICR_BUSY)
	cpu_relax();
}
And new one will look something like.
        do {
                send_status = apic_read(APIC_ICR) & APIC_ICR_BUSY;
                if (!send_status)
                        break;
                udelay(100);
        } while (timeout++ < 1000);
There will be at max 100 microsecond delay before you realize that IPI has
been dispatched. To optimize it further we can change it to 10 microsecond
delay
        do {
                send_status = apic_read(APIC_ICR) & APIC_ICR_BUSY;
                if (!send_status)
                        break;
                udelay(10);
        } while (timeout++ < 10000);
 
or may be
        do {
                send_status = apic_read(APIC_ICR) & APIC_ICR_BUSY;
                if (!send_status)
                        break;
                udelay(1);
        } while (timeout++ < 100000);
I don't know if 1 micro second delay is supported. I do see it being
used in kernel/hpet.c
Is it too much of performance overhead? Somebody who knows more about it
needs to tell. To me changing apic_wait_icr_idle() seems simple instead
of introducing a new function and then making a special case for NMI.
Thanks
Vivek
