	Uh oh...  I know this is going to sound condensending but please
bear with me and understand that this has happened before (hell, its
happened to me before).  The "Signal failed, error=-3" is indicative of
an earlier version of smbmount that would give all of the symptoms exactly
as you have described.  That makes me suspicious that you may not have
successfully updated the smbmount binary.
	1) Double check that you ran configure with the "-with-smbmount"
option before building and installing samba.  You can check the Makefile
in the source directory for a define for "MPROGS".  If that define is
empty, you didn't build smbmount.
	2) Make sure that you don't have more than one smbmount in your path.
If you don't specify the -prefix=/usr option when configuring the Samba
build, smbmount is going to get installed in /usr/local/bin instead of
/usr/bin.  If there is already an smbmount in /usr/bin, you will execute
that one instead of the new one.
	"whereis smbmount" will tell you were all the versions are.
	"which smbmount" will tell you which one got executed.
	Do an "ls -l" on the smbmount indicated by which and verify that
it was updated by your build.
	3) If you are running RedHat, make sure that you applied the
RedHat package patches out of "packaging/RedHat/*.patch" before doing
the configure and build (Actually, I think the patch to Makefile.in
is the only important one.  The other one is for smbsh and doesn't
affect smbmount).
