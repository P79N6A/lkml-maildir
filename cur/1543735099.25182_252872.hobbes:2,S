Not really!

Any state gcc might keep would be stored on
the kernel stack or in a register, which will
be preserved because tasks don't share these.
AFAIK, gcc generates thread-safe code. It won't
convert code to something like this:
int foo(int bar){
static task_struct *__L131241 = get_current();
// blah, blah...
}

I don't think even barrier() is needed.
Suppose gcc were to cache the value of
current over a schedule. Who cares? It'll
be the same after schedule() as it was
before.
