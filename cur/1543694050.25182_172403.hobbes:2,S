What is it with people wanting their features forced into kernels which
don't need them? First the Athlon bugfix patch, now this. There are
people out here who would like to use 2.6 kernels in small (possibly
embedded) applications.
I have nothing against any of these features, but if they aren't needed
they are just bloat. Please don't oppose making features configurable.
