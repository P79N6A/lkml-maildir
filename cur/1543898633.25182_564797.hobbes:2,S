Alternately, the app needs to be able to cope with unexpected system
shutdown (aka crash) and the same ability will allow it to cope with
an atomic snapshot.  It may be able to recover more efficiently from
an expected shutdown, so being able to tell the app about an impending
snapshot is probably a good idea, but it should be advisory only.
