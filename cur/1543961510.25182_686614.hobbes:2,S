Hi Andy,
I think the following:
#warn if <asm/foo.h> is #included and <linux/foo.h> is available (uses RAW line)
                if ($tree && $rawline =~ m{^.\#\s*include\s*\<asm\/(.*)\.h\>}) {
                        my $checkfile = "$root/include/linux/$1.h";
                        if (-f $checkfile && $1 ne 'irq') {
                                WARN("Use #include <linux/$1.h> instead of <asm/$1.h>\n" .
                                        $herecurr);
                        }
                }
in checkpatch.pl can lead to false positives for asm/ includes from within
linux/ files? e.g., I have a patch which moves the asm/hugetlb.h #include up to
the top of include/linux/hugetlb.h, but I get:
[09:46:27]nacc@arkanoid:~/linux/views/linux-2.6-work$ git show HEAD | ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -
WARNING: Use #include <linux/hugetlb.h> instead of <asm/hugetlb.h>
#17: FILE: include/linux/hugetlb.h:8:
+#include <asm/hugetlb.h>
Thanks,
Nish
