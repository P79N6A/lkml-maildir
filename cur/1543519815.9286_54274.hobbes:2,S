I recently noticed that the LILO that comes with SuSE 6.3 chops the
command line at 79 characters.
The LILO that comes with SuSE 6.3 has a patch called
"lilo-newEBDA.patch" applied which limits the length of the command line
to 79 characters. If this is the problem you are seeing then remove the
patch and recompile the source rpm. (I can also mail you a new rpm if
you want.)
