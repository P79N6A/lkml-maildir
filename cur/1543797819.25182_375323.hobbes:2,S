Back when ioread was being discussed on linux-arch, I remember Linus 
saying that perhaps *all* ioreads should be relaxed wrt. DMA (unlike the 
current mmio accessor functions), but I'm not sure if those are the 
semantics we finally settled on.  If not, an ioread*_relaxed would be 
nice to add for the platforms that can support it.
