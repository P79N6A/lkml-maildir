A possibly important legal point is that they never actually restrict your
rights to distribute everything they've given you.
Barring a contract that *obligates* them to provide you with future binary
updates, I can't see much to hang a GPL violation on.  They never stop you
from distributing your current stuff - they merely don't provide you with
*future* (and quite possibly never-actually-happening) software.  100% of what
you *do* receive from them you can redistribute.
Yes, it's sleazy, but barring a contractual obligation, probably not illegal.
(If they're not shipping *future* updates out of the kindness of their heart,
without a contract obligating it, then I'm in deep shit because I haven't shipped
the LSM I said I'd be posting, but which hasn't happened because of other problems
I had with -rc1-mm3.  Think about whether you want to be in that boat... ;)
