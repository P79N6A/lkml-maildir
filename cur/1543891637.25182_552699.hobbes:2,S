I wonder how many of your LOGFS_BUG{,_ON} still remain after the
error handling is in place to deal with broken file system contents.
Ideally, I'd say the current LOGFS_BUG() should be replaced with
a function that prints about the kind of error it has hit (rate-limited),
potentially calls logfs_crash_dump(), and remounts the medium read-only,
but _not_ call BUG().
