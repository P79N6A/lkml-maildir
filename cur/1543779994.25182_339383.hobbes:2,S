Who said that? Linux LiveCDs all load it from CD, and since the kernel 
provides initramfs, the initrd can also be loaded from within the kernel 
itself.

Though, I am seeing your point. The initrd= option does not seem to take block 
devices, so this must be a bootloader feature - because the bootloader needs 
to load the initrd into some memory location so the kernel can play with 
afterwards.

root=/dev/ram0 initrd=somefile_on_the_iso init=/my_favorite_file_in_the_initrd
Works wonders.
