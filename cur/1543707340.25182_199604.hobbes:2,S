No, it will run at the same speed as before -- the ratio between actual
cpu_khz and cpufreq/scaling_setspeed will always be the same.

That's not the point: some hardware (e.g. ARM) needs different memory
settings and different settings of the LCD controller  for different 
CPU frequencies, as the Front Side Bus of the CPU is closely related 
to the CPU frequency. On x86, all cpufreq techniques I've
seen so far do not modify the FSB [*], so memory settings etc. do not need
to be modified.

[*] or scaling the FSB didn't work...
