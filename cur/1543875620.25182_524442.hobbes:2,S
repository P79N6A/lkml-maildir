oh yeah.  Did that fix make it into 2.6.20.x?
I think we decided that make-aout-executables-work-again.patch might still
be a desirable thing to have, but I don't recall the reasoning for that.
Anyway, if it doesn't fix a bug it is nowhere near a high-priority patch
for that seething bugfest which we like to call a kernel, so I'll drop it.
