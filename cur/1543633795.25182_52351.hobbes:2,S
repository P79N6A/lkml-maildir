Correct, and this patch basically does both of the above. 
The problem is that CONFIG_X86_TSC is enabled on PPro and above cpus.
The machines which are having this problem are multi-node P3 or P4
systems. Each cpu has a working TSC, its just that because they are not
synced they should not be used. 
So the patch adds a CONFIG_DISABLE_TSC which is then checked where
earlier just CONFIG_X86_TSC was used. Additionally, if
CONFIG_DISABLE_TSC is set, the flag set by "notsc" is also set.
The usage of CONFIG_X86_TSC took me a bit to get my head around
initially, so your clarification is helpful.
Thanks
