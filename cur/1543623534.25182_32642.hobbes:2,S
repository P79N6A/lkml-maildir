  DaveM> Oh I didn't know you didn't use those changes.
No we don't.  We discussed it but the feeling was that the swiotlb is
overall the better choice (for 2.4.xx).  I don't really care about
this issue all that much myself, as it affects only platforms that
don't have a hardware I/O TLB and use PCI cards that can't address the
entire physical address space.
  DaveM> Your version is still broken then.
Ah, classic DaveM.  You're obviously entitled to your opinion.
