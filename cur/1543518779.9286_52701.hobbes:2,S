I have a Dual Xeon 450. Kernel 2.2.14pre12, with the lm_sensors patches.
about every eight hours, it locks solid. no oops, no nothing.  I realize this
isn't much to work from, but I read on alans site that he has heard nothing bad
about 2.2.14pre12 yet.  dunno if this qualifies..
I am going to recompile without the lm_sensors patches, just in casae there
is some interaction issue with them.
BTW: I get l-k in diagest, so replies to me will be answered faster.
