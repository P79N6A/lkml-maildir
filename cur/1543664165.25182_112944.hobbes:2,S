Personally I'd point the finger more in the direction of the hardware for
that remark, but still ;-)

Right ... not sure what they were smoking when they wrote / implemented
that, but yes, that's what it says.

The latter, IIRC, 2 writes worked most of the time, but never really fixed
it. Using any kind of logical analysis never seemed to work on that chip
... brute force, trial and error, and 3 months of tearing my hair out was
the only thing that suceeded in the end. A time I have no wish to revisit
;-)
cc'ed James Cleverdon ... he was involved in this with PTX, and gave me
some  pointers to hair-restorer during the Linux timeframe.
