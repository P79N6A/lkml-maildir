Everybody who takes a 3 minute read of SELinux keeps saying it has, but 
it hasn't quite, not when you look at the details.  SELinux is not 
written by filesystem folks, and there are scalability details that matter.

It doesn't exist, and viewprints are also not stored with executables 
either, so it is not process oriented.
People think the problem is allowing the OS to enact fine grained 
security.  It is not.  The problem is allowing the user to enact fine 
grained security, and without a lot of work to automate it, users will 
continue to be unable to bear that time cost.
