I tried various kernel compilations; for fun and joy, I built a totally
monolithic kernel with almost all options turned on. I probably won't
boot it, heh. First, there were some modules/sourcefiles that fail to
compile:
	CONFIG_MTD_AMDSTD
	CONFIG_MTD_JEDEC
	CONFIG_FB_PM3
There are also some issues in drivers/net/wan/sdla_*.c that I had to
fix before make was able to link to .tmp_vmlinux1.bin. I will post a 
compile-fix in another thread. Now back to the inlining part. I have a
number of flavors to show...
All done with gcc version 4.0.2 20050901 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux)
	std:		vanilla 2.6.15-rc7
	Os:		vanilla + CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	noinl:		vanilla + Arjan's noinline
	noinl-Os:	vanilla + CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE + noinline
Specials:
	NFI:		no forced inline (removal of always_inline part)
Information from make (bzImage):
	std:		System is 12226 kB
	Os:		System is 10879 kB
	noinl:		System is 12181 kB
	noinl-Os:	System is 10851 kB
	NFI:		System is 12198 kB
