The rational is that I don't want to see my inodes sparse around the fs by
an luser. I don't want to find them in /tmp. I don't care if he takes them
opened, the root can kill his tasks and the fs layout will return normal
then. It's a namespace issue. If I put my inode in my directory it must
not finish into /tmp after some time by somebody that has nothing to do
with me.
