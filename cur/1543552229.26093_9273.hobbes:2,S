Subject: [PATCH] Make sure cpu_data[] is cache line aligned

Hi Alan,
cpu_data[] should be cache line aligned to make the per CPU pte allocation
tricks work without false sharing. This patch ensure this 
(against 2.2.18pre15). Without it it is rather a gamble (1 : 8). With 32
byte cache lines it probably does not hurt too much because the stuff
at the beginning of cpuinfo_x86 is not frequently accessed, and it ensures
that the hot fields are separated by at least 32bytes, but with P4-SMP and 
K7-SMP that will likely not work anymore.
Please apply,
-Andi
