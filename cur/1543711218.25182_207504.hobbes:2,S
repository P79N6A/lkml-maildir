for the short term it's ok, I agree longer term we may want to make them
swappable, but we don't necessairly need to support efficient swapping
for huge vmas (i.e. 10G, if one wants efficient swapping
remap_file_pages shouldn't be used).
Could you tell me how you called the mlock sysctl that Wli talked about?
(Wli mentioned the mlock sysctl in a patch from you) Thanks.
