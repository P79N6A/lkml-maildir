   I'm aware this way all ports actively using `mm->context' needs to
   be changed but the change is certainly a no-brainer... OK?
My problem is that I don't want to typedef it to a structure, this
will unnecessarily increase the required alignment of the structure
member on some architectures.
Well, if you're willing to do all the fixing up, then I won't argue it
much more. :-)
