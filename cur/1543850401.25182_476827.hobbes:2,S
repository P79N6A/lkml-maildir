Ok, let us know if you find anything there.

One of the recent changes was removing the in-kernel PPS code. This was
done because there were no in-kernel users of the interface (the only
ones being I believe in a variant of this LinuxPPS patch). While from
the diffstat below it doesn't look like the patch affects the
timekeeping code, it would be good to first reproduce the issue without
the patch.

Could you also send me a copy of your full dmesg?
