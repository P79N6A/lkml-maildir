 From reading the EVMS list, it was working with 2.5.36 a couple weeks
ago but needs some small bio and gendisk changes to work in 2.5.39.

CVS version may be up-to-date quite soon from reading the thread.
It seems to be further along in 2.5 support than LVM2 - also including
the fact that EVMS supports LVM1 metadata (which the 2.5 version of LVM2
may not do so quite so soon from mentions on the lvm list).
I haven't tried EVMS but certainly from looking at the feature set,
it looks more comprehensive and modular than LVM (with its support
for multiple metadata personalities).
I too have LVM on quite a few of my machines, including my desktop,
and if I wanted to test 2.5 right now - i'd probably have to do it
using EVMS.
