Andrew,
I've fixed a number of issues in i2o layer:
[patch i2o 1/6] i2o_cfg_passthru cleanup (memory leak and infinite loop)
[patch i2o 2/6] wrong memory access in i2o_block_device_lock()
[patch i2o 3/6] i2o message leak in i2o_msg_post_wait_mem()
[patch i2o 4/6] i2o proc reading oops
[patch i2o 5/6] i2o_proc files permission
[patch i2o 6/6] i2o debug output cleanup
However because of Markus Lidel is not i2o maintainer now, I do not understand
who should agree the following patches.
Thank you,
	Vasily Averin
