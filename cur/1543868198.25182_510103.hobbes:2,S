It's buggy there too but you are not experiencing this one.
1 - netpoll() calls the poll() handler of the device through netpoll_poll()
2 - The poll handler of the device tries to acquire dev->_xmit_lock
    through dev_mc_add during the Rx protocol processing
3 - netpoll() holds dev->_xmit_lock to avoid recursion in netpoll_poll()
#2 and #3 have opposite requirements.
