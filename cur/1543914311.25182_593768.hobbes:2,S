Avoiding -- or at least detecting -- symlink racing with mkdir() is
relatively simple: run mkdir(), make sure you don't get EEXIST or
something like that, lstat() the resulting path -- it should be a
directory with all the right modes and ownerships.
I believe -- but I'm not certain -- that mkdtemp() in glibc will do all
this for you.  If not, I would consider that a glibc bug.
