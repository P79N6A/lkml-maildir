I have seen nothing break but 4 MB allocations f.e. will not be allocated 
on a 4MB boundary with a 2 MB zone alignment. The page allocator always 
returnes properly aligned pages but 4MB allocations are an exception? 
Some present or future hardware device or some other code may find that 
surprising and crash.
