On 13 Jul 1999 Zygo Blaxell made an (IMHO elegant) proposal for a
generalized allocation mechanism that could handle any kind of alignment /
memory range requirements for _any_ device:
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9907_02/msg00702.html
Some PCI cards are limited to less than 30 bits range! And other cards
have odd alignment requirements. Zygo's proposal covers them all.
