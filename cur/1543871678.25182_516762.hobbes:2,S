I don't believe I'm wasting my time explaining this. They don't exist
as /dev/null, they are just fucking _LINKS_. I could even "ln -s
/proc/self/fd/0 sucker". A real /dev/stdout can/could even exist, but
that's not the point!
It remains a stupid comparison because /dev/stdin/stderr/whatever
"must" be plugged, else how could a process write to stdout/stderr
that it coud'nt open it ? The way things are is not because it's
cleaner to have it as a file but because it's the only sane way.
/dev/null is not a must have, it's mainly used for redirecting
purposes. A sys_nullify(fileno(stdout)) would rule out almost any use
of /dev/null.

If I were to become a kernel developer I would stick with FreeBSD. At
least they have kqueue for about seven years now.
