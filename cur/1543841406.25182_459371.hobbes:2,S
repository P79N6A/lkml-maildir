We'll definitely need this for X11 anyways. Currently it is not
possible to run the standard X server with a IOMMU that isolates
the graphics card because it has no way to get at the GPU MMIO
registers then.
My long-term plan was to integrate it in /sys/bus/pci mmaps
(together with PAT etc.). When you mmap it there the kernel
allocates a DMA mapping and then frees it on unmap.
Then it should hopefully just work.
