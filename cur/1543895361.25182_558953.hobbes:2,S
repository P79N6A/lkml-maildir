That has been threaten to change many times. Far far far too much
are marked inline today. There has been several longer threads about it.
Part of it is that some part MUST be inlined to work while other parts
may be inline but not needed (and often the wrong thing).
So a carefully added inline is good but the other 98% of inline
markings are just wrong and ougth to go.
