Subject: [patch] static declaration for `init_fat_fs' follows non-static

I have no idea where to mail it, so I'll send it here.
In fatfs_syms.c, It says:
static int __init init_fat_fs(void)
while in msdos_fs.h:
extern int init_fat_fs(void);
This really doesn't work together, and I think it really should be static,
so I removed that line from msdos_fs.h.
simple patch is attached.
