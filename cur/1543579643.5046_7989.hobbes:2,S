Well, I boot into Linux, all is fine, rebooted into a different version 
of Linux for some testing, all is fine (this was an older version, I 
believe it was 2.2.14 or .15)  Try to install ME and run it, seems ok. 
Go back to Linux, and my drive was fried with Windows files all over it, 
etc.
I know Windows shouldn't touch a Linux partition.  But, apparently it 
did.  Or else Linux and/or Fdisk are fried and made a bad partition table.

I said what I did, because it seems the evidence said Windows did do it. 
  If it didn't, oops.  I have talked with others and they had a similar 
experience, so I am not alone.

Well, this is actually the second time I have had Windows write all over 
my Linux partition.  The first time I think it was not a bug in either, 
but a bug in hardware.  However, I no longer have that hardware as my 
desktop.
