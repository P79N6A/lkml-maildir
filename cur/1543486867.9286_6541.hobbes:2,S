The goal here is not to have the kernel handle interleaved XA files ADPCM
decoding etc but rather prevent applications from having to do all sorts
of ioctl gymnastics and CDROMREADRAW just to get at the data. Rather have
the kernel do it transparently so they can just fopen() them as regular
files.
So the XA sector size is 2336 bytes, what other issues are there other
than the odd sector size?
