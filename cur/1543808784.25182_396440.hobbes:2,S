Has been available for quite some time.
However the calls are currently slower than gettimeofday and also
don't use nanoseconds internally in all cases (depends on the architecture), 
but still microseconds.  But I'm not sure it matters that much
because the underlying timers are often not better than microseconds
anyways and with nanoseconds you start to time even the inherent system
call latency.
