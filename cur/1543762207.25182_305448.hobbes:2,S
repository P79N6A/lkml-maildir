Subject: [PATCH 0/6] freepgt: free_pgtables shakeup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's the recut of those patches, including David Miller's vital fixes.
I'm addressing these to Nick rather than Andrew, because they're perhaps
not fit for -mm until more testing done and the x86_64 32-bit vdso issue
handled.  I'm unlikely to be responsive until next week, sorry: over to
you, Nick - thanks.
Hugh
