no, this is what you are missing.
with tivoizing, the vendors employees are working on linux and 
contributing
without tivoizing and with GPLv3 license involved the vendors employees 
are working on a propriatary OS and are contributing nothing back

not if the GPLv3 achieves it's objectives of forcing the vendor to stop 
useing opensource software.

in a tivoized device, users have access to the source code and can 
understand how things work, incoporate improvements into other projects, 
etc.
In addition, users who bypass the lockdown restrictions can modify the 
software on that device.
in a non-tivoized device users have a black-box and have to reverse 
engineer everything becouse the vendor releases no source at all.
