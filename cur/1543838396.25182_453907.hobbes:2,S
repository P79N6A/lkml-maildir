I have two swap partitions, /dev/hda3 and /dev/hdc1. resume=/dev/hdc1.
If both partitions are mounted, suspend fails with a message of "cannot
determined swap partition", or something to that effect.
If I do swapoff /dev/hda3, then suspend to disk, I get the oops.
No LVM.
I'll try removing /dev/hda3 and try again. Hold on...
