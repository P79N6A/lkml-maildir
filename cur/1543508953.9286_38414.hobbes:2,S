  Hello.
  I'm sending you a small patch to quota code in 2.2.12. It does two things:
1) Fixes possible race in sync_dquots() where we could end up writing invalidated quota.
2) Speeds up quotaoff - currently when inode cache was full of inodes with quota pointers
   set, which is likely when quota enabled on root, quotaoff could take a few seconds
   which is unpleasant. So I made a bit more finegrained detection of blocking when we
   remove references from inodes and so we don't have to restart so often.
   The patch is attached.
							Bye
								Honza.
