Not really.  Originally there was UNIX, Nth Edition for values of 
N from 1 to 7.  The ones that were most likely to be seen outside 
of the former Bell Labs were the 5th, 6th, or 7th Editions.
There was an 8th Edition UNIX that was primarily a Bell Labs
internal research version that eventually became Plan 9.  It was
neither UNIX System III or UNIX System V.
