Sounds fine, but excessive for this exercise.  At this stage I'm asking for
sufficient description of the kernel patch to allow other developers to
understand and review the patch, maybe hack on it a bit.  A couple of pages
of ascii should suffice.  I'd consider it compulsory for patches of this
magnitude and scope.
Longer term, yes - having added a bunch of new syscalls to the kernel we
have a responsibility to document the user/kernel API for downstream users,
but that's not a requirement for reviewing the patch.
