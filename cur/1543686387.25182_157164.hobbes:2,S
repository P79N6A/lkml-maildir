The AMD slides assume all very big data sets ;-)

Nothing in kernel AFAIK, but it's possible that it is used by user space
reading /proc/cpuinfo.

X86_FEATURE_PREFETCHW
X86_FEATURE_PREFETCH3DNOW
(note I didn't volunteer to write alternative3 for the later, 
someone else has to do that if they want it ;-)

My solution is a fix as the problem is described in the Opteron
Specification Update (and also as our own testing showed - we discovered
the problem originally) 
The Errata is basically: When there is a prefetch and a load for the 
same address in flight and the load faults and the CPU is in a
very specific complicated state then the Exception is reported
on the prefetch, not the fault. 
The fix just handles the exception and doesn't crash.
At least on Opteron it can be also fixed with a magic bit in the BIOS,
maybe that's possible on XP too. But I opted to work around it in the kernel
to not force all people to get a new BIOS.
BTW we saw it mainly in the x86-64 copy_*_user and csum_copy_* functions
which do also prefetches. LTP would sometimes trigger it when it tests
how the kernel behaves with invalid addresses. But it happened very
rarely in the dcache hash too. But still it's hard to trigger, the
linked list one is very hard to hit. I tried to reproduce it in user space,
but failed. The LTP one is much easier, but still not that common.
