This patch is mostly OK IMHO.
1.  However, both old and new versions say:
  Power management options (ACPI, APM)  --->
but have Software Suspend and CPU Frequency (hidden) below there,
so one has to know to look there for them, while the heading
only says APCI and APM.  I guess that the heading is too restrictive.
2.  APM and ACPI aren't usable together, right?  so should the
Kconfig file prevent both of them from being enabled?
3.  The help text for Software Suspend (not part of this patch)
really needs some help.  Would you address that or shall I?
Thanks,
