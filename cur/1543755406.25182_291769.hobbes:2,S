I've been in contact with one of the developers of the code.  The reason 
we flush the tlb is so that on the next write the cpu has to fault it in 
and set the dirty bit.  Does that make sense?  I should try 
experimenting.....

2.6.9 doesn't have 4 level pagetables.  We'll have to port it forward 
when we eventually upgrade.

I'd rather not be doing it, but there's no nice generic va_to_pte() 
function.  There have been patches, and ppc has one, but as a whole I 
don't know of any nice way to do this.
