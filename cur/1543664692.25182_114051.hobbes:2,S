Hi,
	Got a silly doubt. when trying to insert one of my modules into
the kernel, its getting rebooted and unfortunately i am losing all the
debug(printk) messages.  Can i in some fashion capture all the printk's
through the serial port. (I have two linux boxes and a serial cable to
connect both of them)
Thanx in advance
Prasad.
