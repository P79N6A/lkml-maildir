OK, I think you are missing some details of the workflow used to get patches
to Linus.  As far as I know, he mostly pulls rather than accepts patches,
that's one of the reasons there are so many different kernel repositories
on bkbits.net.  They are mostly queues of stuff waiting for Linus to pull
them. 
If that is correct, then what we really want is email when something
lands on bkbits.net and is not yet included in Linus' tree.  We can
certainly set up a trigger to send email in that case.
