This would require (1) /dev to be inside the root filesystem and (2) users
having write access somewhere in that filesystem.
(1) is uncommon, often a separate filesystem is used for udev
(2) is very bad practice anyway and should never be seen on a true
multi-user machine
Besides, this is nothing new. Dynamic permission updates through PAM have
the same issue, and anyone calling themselves "admin" should be well aware
of those issues. This is basic Unix-security, after all.
Yet, this issue should probably mentioned in documentation. It certainly
should be mentioned in the udev-HOWTO.
