Subject: [PATCH] repair bootmem memory leak

While developing my fresh bootmem, the testing I did to ensure there
were no memory leaks discovered a caller leaking memory:

 	 * reserve physical page 0 - it's a special BIOS page on many boxes,
reserve_boootmem_core() already ensures that the endpoint of the
interval to reserve is rounded up to a page boundary, and so this
(demonstrably) leaks a page whenever
	PFN_PHYS(start_pfn) + bootmap_size + PAGE_SIZE -1
is not page-aligned.
