It's worth noting that you'll need the libata passthrough patch to make 
this work on a T43..
However, with this patch I'm getting the "head not parked 4c" message, 
but I can hear the click from the drive.. It takes around 350-400ms for 
the command to execute, but when repeated, it drops to around 5ms for a 
short while (with no audible clicking), before reverting to original 
behaviour after a few seconds.
The clicking and the variation in execution time lead me to think it is 
parking, but not being reported correctly?
Regards,
Jon,
