If you really have ECN on, check your ISP...  Some like to "help" you by providing
a mandatory transparent HTTP proxy/cache.  USWest does this for at least some of their
DSL customers.
Thankfully, the *do* put a header in, so you can use "telnet www.amazon.com 80" to
check for it--I don't remember the exact header (they are no longer my ISP :), but
I recall it was fairly obvious.
Anyone else trying to compile statistics on ECN compatability should test out their ISP
for this kind of nastyness.  I know I have run into it a lot, starting right about when I
switched ISPs...
