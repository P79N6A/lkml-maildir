Subject: [PATCH] stacktrace: don't crash on invalid stack trace structs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/4/96

This patch makes the stacktrace printout code warn when the entries
pointer is unset rather than crashing when trying to access it in an
attempt to make it a bit more robust.

I was saving a stacktrace into an skb and forgot to copy it across skb
copies... Not sure if you want this, I have since fixed the code, but it
would have been easier had the kernel not crashed in an interrupt.
