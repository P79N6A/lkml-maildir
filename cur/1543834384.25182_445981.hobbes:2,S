Ah, you're right. I thought this was for mainline.  Didn't notice the
-rt in the subject.  Don't worry about documenting the -rt side of
things.  That is not stable enough to do so.  When portions of the rt
patch go to -mm, that will need to be documented. (willing to help in
this effort?)
I'll try later today to review your code a little deeper (no guarantees
since I just came home from Ottawa, and my family would like to see me a
little more).  I'm not sure if the semantics of the changes to the
sched.[ch] are correct, so I'll let Ingo comment on them.  I'll spend my
time looking at the changes to rtmutex.c.
