The OS - as in "normal usage could damage the disk" or as in "allows a
hacker to damage the disk".  The first isn't the case here, the second
is what (it appears) Andre is trying to make harder.
Any OS with the concept of "root" type privs is vulnerable.  I'll just
write the smasher code to your boot sector so next time you reboot the
disk automatically kills itself *BEFORE* the OS has loaded.  Harder,
sure, but not impossible.  Now it's your BIOS that's letting you do this :-)
You'd better move to a different hardware platform totally!
To be honest, I would almost go with the "Andre, please wait until 2.5"
except that I can foresee that 2.4 will be mainstream for 2 years, which
means a known "yuck, I hate this" piece of code is going to be running for
2 years unless Andre's patch is in place.
OTOH, 2.2.x hasn't been as "frozen" as it should have been, so maybe
2.4.2 will find itself with this code anyway!
