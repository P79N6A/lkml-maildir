Hello,
I apologize in advance if this is a dummy question. My web search turned 
up nothing, so I'm trying it here.
We came across the following error message:
Kernelpanic - not syncing: fs/proc/
Generic.c:521: spin_lock(fs/file_table.c:ffffffff80420280)
Already locked by fs/file_table.c/204
This shows a locking problem with the files_lock on a UP kernel with 
spinlock debugging enabled.
I noticed that files_lock is only protected with spin_lock() 
(file_list_lock(), include/linux/fs.h). Is it possible that this should 
be changed to spin_lock_irq()) or spin_lock_irqsave()? Or am I misssing 
something obvious?
Thanks
Martin
