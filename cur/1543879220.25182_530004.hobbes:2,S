I think, after reading the Documentation/memory-barriers.txt and
Documentation/atomic_ops.txt documentation, that spin_lock_init() also
needs this kind of memory barrier.
From what I can tell (Oliver, please correct me if I'm wrong, you know
this much better than I do), the issue is that atomic init has no memory
barrier, and you need to handle that.
