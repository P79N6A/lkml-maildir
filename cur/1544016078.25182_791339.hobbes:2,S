Actually, most of the Boot Interrupt patches resulted from reading the
intel specs and observing the behavior of failing machines. We're trying
to wrap up all the information gathered in a paper, which is pretty time
consuming and a few steps away from being ready to publish.

At the moment I'm uploading the slides we showed at the 10th
Real-Time Linux Workshop, which are a small, stripped down excerpt of
our upcoming paper.
It should be available soon at:
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/sassmann/publication/boot_irq_quirks_rtlws10.pdf
Meanwhile I'd suggest to have a look at United States Patent 6466998.
That is intels patent for this interrupt routing mechanism.
Hope this is helpful, we'll try to make more information available asap.
