Hi,
Some great replies helped me pinpoint the problem, or I should say,
would have .. I decided to use 2.4.0-test7 for the debugging and I can't
reproduce the problem, the nightly backup and tar work fine, no more
tape errors ..
so I consider it fixed for now.... do you think this bugfix time counts
as negative since it was fixed before I reported it? :-)
thanks!
