Don't do this please!!!!!!!!  The BIOS failed to do its job.

This is the result of SLEDGE Hammer to the BIOS.  It is not tuned for that
XFER rate and death will result.  Everyone can shotgun a 12 ounce Beer and
live, but KEG will prevent you from breathing (death).  This a very
accurate reference.

Your BIOS failed in the setup, and I have yet to design forced config code
like I have for the PDC20246 code.  There is a need for more chipset
tuning code gobally, but it is a real pain to generate.  I have two
successful chipset codes and each only do half the job.
PDC20246 code will tune all (U)DMA
HPT343 code with tune all, but PIO modes are successful and (U)DMA choke.
I am working on PIIX, ALI, and VIA code currently, but ALI docs are hard
to read and understand the constaints.
Look at pdc20246.c and see how messy the task is that I am looking forward
to repeating.
