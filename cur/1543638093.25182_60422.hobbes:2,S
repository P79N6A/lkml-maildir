Thanks for your information. Did that, and found your patch.
Tried it, but no luck ;( (as noted in your README.txt)
Nevertheless, this idea:
>> Maybe there should be a kind of separate "WARNING_API_CHANGED" file under 
 Documentation, so that everybody might keep up with the latest "What might 
 be broken now?".
might reduce "noises" in LKML and might save bits and bandwidth.
Best regards,
