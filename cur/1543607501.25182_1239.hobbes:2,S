   Is this waht's causing the earlier bug I reported in 2.4.10?  If so 
   where is this patch so I can see if it fixes the problem.
The patch was in the email, can't you read? :-)
(You even quoted the patch in your reply!)
Anyways, my patch isn't relevant to your problem since the
bug I am fixing only can exist in 2.4.13 and later kernels.
Sorry.
