The way I read this:
+WARNING: Using --file mode. Please do not send patches to linux-kernel
+that change whole existing files if you did not significantly change most
+of the the file for other reasons anyways or just wrote the file newly
+from scratch. Pure code style patches have a significant cost in a
+quickly changing code base like Linux because they cause rejects
+with other changes.
does not discourage the creation of good patches.
But is discourage the creation of pure clean-up patches because it
may have a disturbing effect on several other peoples work.
