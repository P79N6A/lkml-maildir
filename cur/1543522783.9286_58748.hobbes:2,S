It seems to , although the error appears to have occurred at some point
before that, and tcp_retrans_try_collapse gets handed a buffer which appears
to either have been freed, or not to be on a list (skb->next == NULL).

Workaround suggestion: echo "0" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retrans_collapse

This seems to to be the interesting area and looks suspicious:
Dave: Side item tcp_retrans_try_collapse doesnt seem to care about collapsing
in SACK'd data - is that right ?  
Second question:  tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue is entered with tcp->retrans_head
pointing part way into the retransmit queue if we baled part way through
the previous retransmit run (eg cos cwnd got us). We guarantees that
tp->retrans_head is still pointing to a valid packet so right now I
cant see a cause.
Do all the crashes basically look identical ?
