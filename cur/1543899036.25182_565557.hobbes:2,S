which brings us back to the package maintainer maintains the autotool source 
files, not joe blow user.  if there's trouble with the build system, then the 
maintainers (who are knowledgeable in autotools) are in a pretty easy 
position to fix/address it.  as you've stated, hand rolled build systems work 
great for the guy rolling it, but beyond that all bets are off.  util-linux 
had a hand rolled build system that fell apart in many places.  the 
maintainers of util-linux have well versed autotool people at their disposal, 
so i really dont see this as being worrisome.

the large majority of time, i find this to be trivial: read config.log.  but 
this comes with familiarity with the tool and autotools is sitting by far the 
best right now.  if you're having trouble with the package in question, just 
ask on the mailing list and post your config.log; i'm sure you'd get someone 
to readily point out the answer.
