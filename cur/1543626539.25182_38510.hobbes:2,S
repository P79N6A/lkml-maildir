Subject: [PATCH 2.5.8-pre1] ppp_deflate.c fix...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

When compiling 2.5.8-pre1 without CONFIG_PREEMPT, and ppp all in modules,
I have unresolved symbols in ppp_deflate.o (local_bh_enable and
local_bh_disable). If CONFIG_PREEMPT is on, no problems.
The attached patch fixes it by adding some header files to ppp_deflate.c which
somehow makes it properly compile.
But after a second look, I must say I don't really understand how this is 
supposed to work, for example:
	include/linux/spinlock.h 
		* defines spin_lock_bh dependent on local_bh_disable
		* defines preempt_disable
	include/asm-i386/softirq.h
		* defines local_bh_disable dependent on ... preempt_disable
Do we have here a circular dependency problem or ? 
Stelian.
