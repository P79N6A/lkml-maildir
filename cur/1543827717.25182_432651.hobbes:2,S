Hi,
on my 8 GB system with two 32-bit-xeons, I would like to have more than
3 gigs in userspace.
A 0.5/3.5 GB split appears to be what I need for my application.
I read about the 4G/4G patch from 2004 but couldn't find a current patch
for 2.6.16 - is there anything similar to it that I can apply on a
2.6.16 kernel?
Thanks a lot & regards,
Hanno
