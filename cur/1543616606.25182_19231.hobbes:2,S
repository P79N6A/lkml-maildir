It does not know about uuid per se, but it know in that area some text data is stored.
(BTW, we are started to fix reiserfsprogs, so that struct superblock will be the same in kernel and in reiserfsprogs.
It is already almost close in cvs ;) )
I see MArcello have not applied this patch to 2.4.18-pre3, so we have some more time to prepare reiserfsprogs ;)
