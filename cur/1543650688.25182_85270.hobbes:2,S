Reiser4 stores meta-data in a huge balanced tree. This tree is kept
(partially) in the page cache. All pages in this tree are attached to
"fake" inode. Sometimes you need to remove node from the tree. At this
moment page has to be removed from the fake inode mapping.
Other file systems don't need remove_from_page_cache() because they only
store in the page cache data (and remove_from_page_cache() is called by
truncate()) and meta data that are never explicitly deleted (like
directory content in ext2).
Nikita.
