They _can_ be removed, with absolutely no build failures at all, because
of the "default y if ..." on the dependency that is defined in some
arch/.../Kconfig.
In fact the whole _idea_ is to remove any mention of the arch-specific
dependency from arch-agnostic stuff in drivers/.../Kconfig's (be it
"depends" or "select") so as not to generate those "unknown symbols"
warnings that would come on other archs. Hence, the normal practice to
use the "default y if ..." idiom (for "bool" helper code like the original
examples on this thread) in arch/.../Kconfig files.
