Alpha DP264 (UP), SCSI, floppy
If I do a dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/moo count=100000, I don't see any
increase in buffers, as reported by vmstat.  Furthermore, if I read from
/dev/fd0, it used to buffer the whole thing, so a second read would be
fast -- now it hits the floppy again.
I ran some fairly large things when I first booted, and swapped some stuff
out -- I don't know if this would've happened before.  But now my buffers
number is way small:
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system
cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    ...
 2  0  0   4568 444984  38008 141744   0   0     4    10    9    ...
and it won't grow much bigger than that no matter what I do.
What's up with buffers?
Confused,
