Yes, I realize. That's why I gave the whole dump in the first Email.
These are all lines of 16 bytes that do not contain only zeroes or
only 0xff's.

P.S.
In private I will confess to have edited the cut-and-paste from a
window where I used the hexdump I prepared and have stored on a 26Mb
per second disk:
tmp/memstick> grep -v "ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff   ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff" formatted.img.hd | grep -v "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"

but just to be sure, I actually issued the command I pretended to have
given on the REAL thing, and got:
