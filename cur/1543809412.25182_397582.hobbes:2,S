I'll do that as soon as the perfomance is equal or better than what we 
have right now and expensive 64bit math in the fast path, where it's 
provably a waste, is not exactly encouraging. I already provided all the 
math and code to keep it cheap and (relatively) simple, but I don't have 
the time to work constantly on it, so if you'd help to integrate it into 
John's work it would go a lot faster.
bye, Roman
