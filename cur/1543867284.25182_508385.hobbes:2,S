Sorry, what do you do with "variable 'xxx' might be used uninitialized"
warning when it's false? Turn it off? Annotate the source? Assign fake
initialization value? Change the compiler so that it does "the effort"
for you? Never encountered false positive from this warning?

Yes, I don't argue that. I said "otherwise the warning is more or less
sucks", and then it's up to programmers to decide if it's enough sucks
to be turned off. The decision depends on the importance of its true
positives then. Only if warning never has true positives it is
unconditional, total, unhelpful crap, -- that was my point.

Sure. But unfortunately this in an unreachable aim in most cases.
