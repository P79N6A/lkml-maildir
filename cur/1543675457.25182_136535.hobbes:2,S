   Yes, 19470 entries.  But note that each entry is 4096 bytes.
   Something seems to have gone and bumped the object size from 240
   bytes up to 4096.
I see.
Meanwhile, you can control how large the routing cache allows itself
to grow by changing /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size.  It is the
maximum number of entries the routing cache will allow itself to
expand to.
