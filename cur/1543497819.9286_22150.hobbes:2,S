Are they _in_ the /var/lib/nfs/{rmtab,xtab} files ? If so, that is a
bug in mountd, probably. The following explanation is just a guess,
I haven't looked at the source, but anyway:
The libc routines can print this error to stderr if there are NIS problems.
It can be argued that it is an error that libc prints to stderr from an
internal routine ofcourse, and I'd tend to agree, but lets not do that now :/
Anyway mountd probably closes all files on startup. Then the filedescriptor
associated with /var/lib/nfs/rmtab is filedescriptor 2. If something prints
to stderr, it will print into that file instead :(
The fix is for mountd NOT to blindly close fd 0, 1 and 2 but to do
something like this:
	/* Redirect stdin/stdout/stderr */
	fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDRW);
	dup2(fd, 0);
	dup2(fd, 1);
	dup2(fd, 2);
	if (fd > 2) close(fd);
Similar bugs have been fixed in other programs, such as mount(8).
Mike.
