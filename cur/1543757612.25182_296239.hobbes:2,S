  Is it possible to just merge the BSD accounting and the CSA accounting
by adding in the current BSD per-process accounting structure some
missing fields like the mm integral provided by the CSA patch?
ELSA is just a user of the accounting data. We need a hook in the
do_fork() routine to manage group of processes, not to do accounting.
