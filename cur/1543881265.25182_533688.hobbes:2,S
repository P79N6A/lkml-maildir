Sure, I'm fine with a name change. If it makes more sense to name that
driver i2c-mpc8xx, that's OK with me.

Blocking is not a problem. The problem is that you are keeping the CPU
for yourself while waiting, for up to one full second. That's not
acceptable. You should at least call schedule() or cond_resced() (I
don't know the difference, I admit) and/or cpu_relax() as is done in
i2c-mpc, i2c-ibm_iic and scx200_acb, or even sleep, as is done in
i2c-omap. Search for "time_after" in these 4 drivers for examples. I
believe that sleeping is more friendly.

Well as far as I can see, only the repeated start is missing, so it's
not that far from a complete implementation. If the hardware can do it,
you simply have to add it to the driver. If the hardware really doesn't
do it (which would surprise me, but you never know), of course you
cannot implement it in the driver and we'll have to live with (well,
without) it. But that's definitely an issue to keep in mind if I2C chip
drivers start failing when used together with this bus driver.

i2c-mpc8xx then, OK.

I don't follow you here, sorry. Platform devices are declared by
board-specific code which can include all the needed initialization.
And device-specific data can be carried to the platform driver for
further use. The platform device/driver infrastructure is meant to
handle that kind of situation, so there really is no excuse that I can
see not to use it. i2c-omap and i2c-mpc use it. As a matter of fact you
_are_ declaring a platform driver (.bus = &platform_bus_type), just not
using the standard way.
