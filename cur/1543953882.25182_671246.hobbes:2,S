I don't know the rationale, but all the code I can see uses rb_entry() 
and not container_of().  The only rationale I can think of is that it 
abstracts away from the nodes being embedded in the data a little bit. 
(But not by much - in particular, an implementation of rb trees that 
stored data in the node explicitly would only need a single parameter in 
its rb_entry() accessor.  I like the approach taken in 
include/linux/elevator.h that uses the rb_entry() macro to create a 
specialized accessor macro (rb_entry_rq()) with a single parameter.
