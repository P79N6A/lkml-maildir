I am using the v90 tulip driver with a Net Gear FA 310TX. Motherboard is a
Tyan Tomcat. I can get the card to work about 10% of the time. If I do get
it to work, it stops working after a seemingly random period of time.
Other than the familliar "Transmitter Stopped!" messages, I get nothing
useful logged anywhere. Same problem with 2.0.36, 2.0.37 and 2.2.5
I have tried every slot on the bus, sometimes I can get it to work if I
ifconfig down the interface but most often not. In all cases, it seems to
silently stop working after some period of inactivity.
Is there some magic tweak I can make in the driver to get this thing to
work?
