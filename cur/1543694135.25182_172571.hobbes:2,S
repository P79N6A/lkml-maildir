Patch looks good to me, but your patch did not apply.
Can you please download the latest 2.4 and 2.6 snapshots, and create 
patches versus those kernels?
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.
[46]/snapshots/
Also, please send patches, uncompressed, in separate emails.  i.e. one 
for 2.4, and one for 2.6.
