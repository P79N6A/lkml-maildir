Hi,
2.3.24 compiled and booted successfully on non-SMP box.
Problem:
At console: As soon as I press enter after typing in the username,  it
clears the username field and returns to the empty username prompt.
Doing it several times in succesion brings up the message that the
specific mingetty process has been stopped by the kernel for respawning
too often.  I can successfully login with xdm, but are unable to enter
any text into xterms.
On reboot to 2.2.13pre15, I can see a message in /var/log/messages
stating:
Oct 28 18:35:41 alwyns /sbin/mingetty[715]: tty2: invalid character
This repeats for every unsuccessfull login.
Everything works fine in 2.2.13pre15.
Mingetty version is 0.9.4 and virtual terminals are compiled into 2.3
kernel.
