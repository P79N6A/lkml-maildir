Subject: acpi ->video_device_list corruption

The ->cap fields of struct acpi_video_device and struct acpi_video_bus
are 1B each, not 4B. The oversized memset()'s corrupted the subsequent
list_head fields. This resulted in silent corruption without
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST and BUG's with it. This patch uses sizeof() to pass
the proper bounds to the memset() calls and thereby correct the bugs.
Included as a MIME attachment is a compressed dmesg from an affected
system. The patch was seen to resolve the issue on the affected system.
vs. 2.6.24-rc5
