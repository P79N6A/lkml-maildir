Interesting.  Here's what I'm doing (it's subtle, but cute and efficient 
-- 1 instruction and an untaken branch for both readers and writers):
count is initially set to a BIAS (I'm using 0x01000000).  Readers
decrement count by 1 and see a positive value if successful.  Writers
decrement by the BIAS and see a result of zero when acquired. 
This makes the recovery case a bit more challenging, but easily solved
with a second value used to decide who is the next writer (and thus
responsible for maintaining the bias while waiting).
