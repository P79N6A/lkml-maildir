	I am not a lawyer, so please do not use this as legal advice.
	I think you're missing the idea that that such drivers are
_contributory_ infringement to the direct infringement that occurs when
the user loads the module.  In other words, even for a driver that has
not a byte of code derived from the kernel, if all its uses involve it
being loaded into a GPL'ed kernel to form an infringing derivative
work in RAM by the user committing direct copyright infringement against
numerous GPL'ed kernel components, then it fails the test of having
a substantial non-infringing use, as established in the Betamax decision,
and distributing it is contributory infringement of those GPL'ed
components of the kernel.
