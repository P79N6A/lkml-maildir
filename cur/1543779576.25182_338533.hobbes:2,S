Unfortunately no. I'm trying to finish a milestone that was due last
Friday, debug a problem that was found on my last milestone, and add a
feature to Ingo's RT patch. So I can't get to this till at earliest next
week.
Also, I don't know if this is a kernel issue or a debian issue since I
updated my kernel at the same time I did a debian upgrade, and I'm using
debian unstable. Since debian unstable is going through some major
changes, this could be caused by that.  I may be able to try some other
machines to see if they are affected, but that might take some time
before I can get to it.
The machine that I noticed this on is a SMP AMD 2.1GHz with a gig of
ram. So the keyboard shouldn't be affected by the screen display. But I
have had X problems with the latest release of debian unstable.
