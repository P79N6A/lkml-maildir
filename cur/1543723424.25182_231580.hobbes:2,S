exit_notify() will inform the tracer:
        if (tsk->exit_signal != -1 && thread_group_empty(tsk)) {
                int signal = tsk->parent == tsk->real_parent ? tsk->exit_signal : SIGCHLD;
                do_notify_parent(tsk, signal);
        } else if (tsk->ptrace) {
***             do_notify_parent(tsk, SIGCHLD);   *****
        }
so this should catch it. It even gets the pid of the child in the siginfo 
structure if it really wants to see that..
