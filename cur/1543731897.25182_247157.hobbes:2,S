Sending a URL to a big patch is a necessary evil for mailing lists, so the
best approach would be to also mail the patches directly to the guy(s) who
you wish to apply them.
An even better approach is to split the patches up so they are not so big ;)
Following the "once concept per patch rule" works well.
