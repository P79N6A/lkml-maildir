The distribution vendors already put the boot area low down the disk to
handle a whole variety of problems like this and the 1024 cylinder limit
on old BIOSes.

I work for a vendor. I get most of our IDE layer bugs. And do you know
HPA doesn't really feature. The broken locking does, the hangs on
changing down speed by CRC do, numerous fascinating platform specific
bugs do, people with cables backwards do. HPA doesn't. It just works out
for people.

A lot of applications assume Linux reported size == real disk size. It
also wouldn't solve the case of a file system that spans both inside and
outside the HPA.
