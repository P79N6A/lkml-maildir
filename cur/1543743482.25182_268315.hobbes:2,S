Hm, I don't think that patch caused the reversal, it seems like we've
always linked this in the opposite order as my System.map before this
patch went in shows:
	c04b016c t __initcall_kobject_uevent_init
	c04b0170 t __initcall_netlink_proto_init
So, Robert and Kay, any thoughts as to how this has ever worked at boot
time in the past?
thanks,
