I argue in favour of extra locking simply because the concept doesn't
fundamentally harm scalability ie. because it is very short held and
there are other unavoidable cacheline conflicts already there.
Having it a sleeping lock rather than spinning is another thing though.
However unless you imagine it running into other long held page lockers
(I guess reclaim might be one, but quite rare -- any other significant
lock_page users that we might hit?), then I don't think it would impact
scalability much on workloads that don't already hurt.
