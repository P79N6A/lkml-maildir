I had something like this for a long time on my todo list. The idea
was to set core_name_format to the name of a named pipe and have an 
daemon on the other end that logs backtraces to syslogd (something a 
bit like dr.watson) 
Only problem is that it won't handle parallel coredumps very well
without some additional (deadlock prone) global locking or alternatively 
support AF_UNIX stream sockets too that have the concept of multiple 
streams over a single name.
