The only bit that could run in parallel is this one.
.PHONY: $(patsubst %, _modinst_%, $(SUBDIRS))
$(patsubst %, _modinst_%, $(SUBDIRS)) :
        $(MAKE) -C $(patsubst _modinst_%, %, $@) modules_install
The erase must be done first (serial), then make modules_install in
every subdir (parallel), then depmod (serial).

make dep, make clean and the various install targets are not parallel
safe in 2.4.  Most of the make vmlinux, bzImage, modules is parallel
safe but even in those phases there are known problems because the 2.4
makefiles do not make it easy to handle cross directory dependencies.
The recommended sequence for 2.4 is
  make xxxconfig
  make dep
  make clean <if necessary>
  make -j n bzImage modules
  make modules_install
The makefile rewrite for 2.5 will fix these parallelism problems.  The
2.4 system is too fragile with too many special cases, nobody is game
to fix the parallelism and guarantee that it will not break anything
else.  modules_install in 2.5 will be fast!
