/usr/src/linux-2.5.59/COPYING:
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

(btw - thanks for bootsplash, looks pretty cool.. ;)
