As long as there is no port 80 card or a similar device using it. If 
there is a port 80 card, ISA acess needing the delay does break, cause
the data corruption you fear and does cause this thread to be started.
Pest, Cholera ...
OTOH, maybe the 6-MHz-delay is the same as the 8-MHz-delay, and the kernel 
parameter is not needed.
