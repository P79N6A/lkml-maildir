Ashamed !? Take a look at your original patch and then define shame. You 
had a communication mechanism that whilst being a private 1<->1 
communication among two tasks, relied on a single global message 
strucure, lock and mutex. Honestly I do not like myself to add stuff 
inside a strcture for one-time use. Not because of adding 12 bytes to the 
struct, that are laughable. But because it is used by a small piece of 
code w/out a re-use ability for other things.
