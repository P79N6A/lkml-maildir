This seems very wrong to me: there's no guarantee that a module will
be loaded into memory that can be used as a DMA target.  For example,
on a non-cache-coherent architecture, I think this memory must be
accessed through a non-cached mapping.
I think the correct solution is to allocate a buffer for each device
with pci_alloc_consistent() (or maybe dma_alloc_coherent()).
(As a general comment, I'm still unhappy about how your driver has a
static, fixed-size table of devices rather than allocating per-device
data structures dynamically)
