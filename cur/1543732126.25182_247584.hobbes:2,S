Who audits all current users of inline whether they are __always_inline?
Who ensures, that in the future there will always be the right one of 
inline and __always_inline choosen in the kernel?
If it doesn't give a compile or runtime error for anyone when it's 
wrong, many wrong inline/__always_inline will go into the kernel over 
time.
The intention might be a different semantics, but in the end, it won't 
work.
E.g., check how many wrong __init/__exit annotations show up in 2.6, 
each of whom would have been a compile error in 2.4 (and different 
from a wrong inline/__always_inline, a wrong __init/__exit annotation 
can cause real problems for users).
If you want to change inline at some point, you will have to audit all  
users of inline anyway - so why bother if you don't intend to change 
inline in the forseeable future?
