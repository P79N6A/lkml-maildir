My USB key drive takes 5s to show up as SCSI, from the moment 'uhci_hcd'
and 'usb-storage' spit out message.  I don't know why.  Internally, USB
key drive is solid state flash memory, so it should be faster than any
spinning disks.
The USB key drive works when I load the USB/SCSI modules as modules.
But, when I boot all-compiled-in-kernel and try to mount /dev/sda1 as
root device, the kernel panicks before the USB key drive has chance to
register.  This means that in order to do 'usbboot', one must go through
the contorted process of 'initrd' which is advocated only by special
interest group whose embedded world is one patch way from becoming
obsolete.
