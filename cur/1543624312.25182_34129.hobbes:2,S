Subject: [PATCH: NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5.6] support for NCR voyager
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The major change since the last voyager patch is that the voyager code is 
split out into an arch/i386/voyager directory which hooks into the main line 
code rather than being mixed with it.
The patch is in two parts this time:  The i386 sub-architecture split is 
separated from the addition of the voyager components

(The split diff is pretty huge because it's actually moving files about).  You 
must apply the split diff before applying the voyager one.
