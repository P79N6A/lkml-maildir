Atomic commit.  The superblock, which references the updated version 
of the filesystem, carries a sequence number and a checksum.  It is 
written to one of two alternating locations.  On restart, both
locations are read and the highest numbered superblock with a correct
checksum is chosen as the new filesystem root.
