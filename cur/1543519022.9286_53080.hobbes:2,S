I really dont think you want it in kernel space. You might want a way to
dispatch bios int calls but you want to do that via a virtualised user
space PC - and that means virtualising bits of the bios, a low page copy,
a copy of the EBDA, mmapping the bios, virtualising the interrupt controller
and some other minor items. 
Its more of a heavily stripped DOSemu than anything else. That beings on user
space.. definitely. Perhaps with an interface so the kernel can send it
'do this int copy these bytes' calls
