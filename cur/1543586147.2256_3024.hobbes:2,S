It looks like the BIOS ran out of MTRRs.  I suspect this is one of the
reasons that Intel changed the PPro spec to allow overlapping MTRRs in
some cases, with uncached taking precedence.  The following sequence
of /proc/mtrr commands should give the same uncachable range with all
memory write-back cached:
# cat >/proc/mtrr
disable=2
disable=3
disable=4
disable=5
disable=6
disable=7
base=0 size=0x400000000 type=write-back
base=0x400000000 size=0x4000000 type=write-back
base=0x404000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-back
^D
(I think all those zeros are correct. 0x400000000 == 16GB, 0x4000000
== 64MB, 0x1000000 == 16MB)
It's probably also worth seeing if a BIOS update is available.
