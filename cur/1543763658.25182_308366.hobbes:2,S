Thinking about this some more, I know of no case of a BE bus connected
to a LE system, nor do I think anyone would ever create such a beast, so
our only missing interface is for a BE bus on a BE system.
Thus, I think io{read,write}{16,32}_native are better interfaces ...
they basically mean pass memory operations without byte swaps, so
they're well defined on both BE and LE systems and correspond exactly to
our existing _raw_{read,write}{w,l} calls (principle of least surprise).
