Aaarrrrhh NO!
Don't you ever login to a box to telent somewhere else?
I don't want to way 5 seconds to disconnect my telnet from the
hung remote machine (or do a saK either).
If this goes in, perhaps a parameter (which automatically shows
up in sysfs) to change it on the fly?  (ok, something tied to
the class device rather than the serial module would be nicer).
