I saw that the HVSI patch made it into 2.6.8.1-mm2 so I decided to play
with it some on my box.  So far, it seems to be working well for me.
I was able to:
-boot with console=hvsi0 and see console messages
-login over an hvsi device
-stable pushing lots of data though it (using things like yes and find
/)
-disconnect and reconnect while pushing data through it without anything
nasty happening
-Ran ppp across hvsi, was able to login via ssh, used tcpspray to stress
it a bit.
I'll keep running with it, but so far it's looking good on my machines.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
