Yeah. The HIDs thinkpad-acpi binds to might exist on non-thinkpads, while
the DMI matching should be good for all new boxes, and all of the old ones
which I have some sort of data on.  The few very old thinkpads I am not
autoloading on are probably not going to care, wouldn't benefit much from
thinkpad-acpi anyway... or they will send me email about it.

Or, if you risk too many false positives.

It would, if we start trying to autoload on false positive matches.  If we
did not have any other way to autoload, that would be fine, but since we
will have DMI matches also in 2.6.23...

Thank you. I did not test the patch, but I am ok with it, now.

It is cooking.  In fact, I was halfway through it, when Richard started
getting me fired up about improving the input layer support in
thinkpad-acpi, which is a damn more fun thing to do... so it stalled, but
now thinkpad-acpi has proper input support, which I will be sending for
acpi-test merging quite soon now.
Some sort of split will be done. Probably for 2.6.23, even.
