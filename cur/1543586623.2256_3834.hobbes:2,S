Another thing making for the snailicity of MO drives is that writing is a
two pass operation.  It is very like core memory; first you write the spot
to a known state, and then you write the data.  So you have an average 
latency of 25 mS. for write operations and 8.33 mS. for read operations.
There WERE direct overwrite media for a while that would, in theory, be
able to write the data directly, but a combination of high cost, limited
sources, and strong questions about the permanence of the recorded data
severely limited the demand for these and I think that they have been
withdrawn.
