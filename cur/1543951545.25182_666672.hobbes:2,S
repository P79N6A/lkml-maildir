Everyone who has write cache turned on for their hard drives is
running in a mode similar to ramback anyway (except for when the file
system is set to force writes to the platter, but that is rare).
Admittedly, software crashes rarely cause the write cache to be lost,
but hardware failures do, practically every time.
Sure, for some things you don't turn write cache on, and for those you
probably don't use ramback. For the rest, ramback looks very enticing.
