There are a whole load of entry points. I've been trying to document all
the ldisc layer stuff as I fix the basic bugs in it. A semaphore isnt
sufficient because some of the entry points have to be multi-entry so
you'd need to go modify all the ldisc internals (I think that will have
to happen eventually). It also relies on it for read v write locking
still.
So far all I've fixed is the vfs/ldisc locking to ensure that open/close
and other events are properly sequenced. I've not yet finished tackling
the ldisc/driver cases where driver->close() completes and the ldisc
calls the driver still.
At that point its at least then down to the drivers to get fixed.
