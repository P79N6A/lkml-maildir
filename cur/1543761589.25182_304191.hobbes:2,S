Does this mean that when it will be ported for i386, I will be able to
really use my Docking Station ?
Does it rescan the DSDT to find new additions to ACPI devices ?
I have an IBM docking station with a PCI bus inside and some other
devices, and when I hot plug my IBM ThinkPad T41 in it, it does not
recognize those devices. Only if I boot in dock they are usable.
And the DSDT is different if I boot in dock or not.
So I wander if this patch would help me to hot plug my T41 in the dock and
all devices will be recognized. (when the patch will be for i386 too)
Thx,
Paul
