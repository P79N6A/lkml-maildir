Hi, this may be a stupid question, sorry for this.
I have kenel 2.6 git tree in my local box, usually through the following 
steps I get source release,
1. copy git repository to a new directory.
2. rm .git directory.
3. make config; make; make modules_install; make install
I there any convinient git command or other ways to get kernel release 
from git repository?
