Well, AFAIK, nobody is actively maintaining atyfb. However, a bunch of
people (including me) have been hacking on it, so I beleive I can help
you there.
Please, can you check what change in atyfb.c between 2.2.17pre14 and
2.2.18preXX caused it to stop working on your machine ? (Revert changes
one after each other until you find the culprit).
Ben.
