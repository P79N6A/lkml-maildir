It does allow the VM to just not worry about this. However I don't
really like this kinds of catch-all conditions that are hard to get
rid of and can encourage bad behaviour.
It would be nice if the "insane" things were made to clean up after
themselves.

That's all true... it would simply be nice to ask the filesystems to do
this. But anyway I think your patch is pretty reasonable for the moment.
