y'know, as I was writing that code I thought "no architecture could be dumb
enough to make PTE_FILE_MAX_BITS variable".

Ah.  That architecture.

The reason I didn't do this in the first place is that if PTE_FILE_MAX_BITS
is 32 (as it is for ia32 PAE), the compiler generates a warning about the
(1<<32).  I guess it generates a bug, too.
Ho hum.  I shall make it "1ULL".
