If I understand well, we may allocate very small fdset, while previous minimum 
size was L1_CACHE_BYTES bytes. (512 bits for a 64 bytes cache line)
If you check commit 0c9e63fd38a2fb2181668a0cdd622a3c23cfd567, 
(
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=0c9e63fd38a2fb2181668a0cdd622a3c23cfd567
 ) 
you'll find this comment of mine :
3) Reduce size of allocated fdset.  Currently two full pages are
   allocated, that is 32768 bits on x86 for example, and way too much.  The
   minimum is now L1_CACHE_BYTES.
This minimum is mandatory to be sure two tasks wont share the same cache line 
to store their fdset (and possibly do lot of cache line ping pongs)
