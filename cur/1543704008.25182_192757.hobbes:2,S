Well, if the CPU is executing userland (or idling), we conceivably could.
That would kill off one userspace process (which might be able to recover
given a signal and longjmp(), but such is life. ;-)

I like the idea of an "unrunnable" queue, that way you have the option to
fix the problem afterwards -- or just ignore it, if you decide it's OK for
processes to wait a few minutes while you replace the failing CPU fan.
It's like mount(). Usually you unmount cleanly, but sometimes you use -f
and something becomes inaccesible. At least WRT CPUs, the inaccessibility
is (usually) fixable. (I wish it were so, WRT NFS mounts.)
