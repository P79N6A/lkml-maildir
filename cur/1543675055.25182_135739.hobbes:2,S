I was interested in finding a tool that would tell me all the paths
through the kernel leading to some particular function, for example in
the case of do_mmap_pgoff:
do_mmap_pgoff do_mmap2 old_mmap old_mmap_i386
do_mmap_pgoff do_mmap2 sys_mmap2
do_mmap_pgoff do_mmap aio_setup_ring ioctx_alloc sys_io_setup
do_mmap_pgoff do_mmap elf_map load_elf_binary
...
I submitted a tool ('fscope') to do this but no one has picked up
on the discussion. So I am wondering if there isn't already some
existing and better way to accomplish the same thing.
Could somebody tell me please, what is that way?
I know you can do a backtrace w/ gdb but that begs the question
how are you going to sure you have found every path?
