Do you mean "execute with ld.so", or "execute with PROT_EXEC mmap"?
I think for ld.so problem to cease existing, it is enought to do
simply "chmod 'go-x' ld.so". For this to work I tried opening the
loader with fsuid=0, like in the attached hack. Chmodding ld.so
also prevents the one from executing the binaries for which he have
no execute permission, which is what an mmap hack doesn't solve.
"execute with PROT_EXEC mmap" argument simply doesn't hold -
MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS with read() will always work, as well
as the mprotect it seems.
