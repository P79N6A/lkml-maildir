 I'm guessing this is really an IDE drive ?  If so, I suspect the
problem is in scsi emulation (which doesn't deny that the bug might
be at least partly in the application, although hanging the box is
nasty).
 Specifically, I've just compiled that version with the debian patch
on my (non-debian) amd64 and successfully ripped a CD (without any
log messages) on both 2.6.18 and 2.6.19-rc3 using /dev/hdc.
 So, if this isn't a real SCSI drive, as a work-around you could try
disabling ide-scsi and use the IDE device name.
