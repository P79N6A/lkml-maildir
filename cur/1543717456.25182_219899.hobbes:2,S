Subject: first PCI probe vs hotplug app on initramfs

Over on the fbdev and dri list were having a big discussion about where to do
mode setting of the graphics hardware.  The normal kernel boot process follow
these steps...
1) kernel probes PCI hardware for built in drivers
2) driver gets probe and triggers hotplug event
3) what can happen here???
4) hotplug event runs early user space program on initramfs
The discussion is centering around what are the side effects of moving the
initialization of the display monitor from step #2 to step #4. There is no
consensus on what can happen in step #3. Do these early hotplug events run
synchronously or asynchronously? Will all of the other drivers initialize before
running the event?
