Sorry, it's not well performing.
mke2fs of a 12G device:
 - buffermem is 200M of my 256M system afterwards
 - minimum swap.
 - lots of system time searching the buffer cache with
   commands afterwards.
 - commands running 50 to 100!!! times slower than before filling buffercache
 - Bad interactive behaviour under X with jumping pointer and slow
   character input when searching buffer cache
Once again: please think about the limitation of buffercache we had before
            with /proc/sys/vm/buffermem!
            If i hack an artivicial 10% limit for the buffercache, i
            _don't_ get that bad performance.
