Unfortunately to have write-only mmap'd area it's a way to solve our
problem with mmap'd audio devices.
To open the file with the right flag permit to us to discriminate at
open time the application intention:
O_RDONLY -> Capture
O_WRONLY -> Playback
O_RDWR   -> Full Duplex
It seems natural, isn't it?
But mmap force us to not use O_WRONLY, grrr...
Now how we can solve this, avoiding to use 3 different minor for each
device (and to use /dev/dsp as it is always used)?
