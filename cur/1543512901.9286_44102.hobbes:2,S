Hi,
I just installed RedHat Linux 6.0 on a HP Kayak Pentium III Xeon,
550MHz. I have a problem as it seems like the Evans & Sutherland
AccelGalaxy video card is not on the list of supported video cards. Do
you know where I can find a driver for this card? I'm sure someone must
be using this card. Your help is much appreciated. Thanks.
Stuart
