The only problem could me getting the generic mmap() code to
properly pass the flag down into the driver, I seem to recall
that it either does an -EINVAL or masks out any flags which
are not in the standard set.
But then again this conflicts with what I remember seeing in the
XFree86 PCI support, in that IA64 passed in such a mmap() flag
to indicate a framebuffer like mapping that didn't need a guard-like
bit to be set.
Someone should look at the code to make sure :-)
