uh-no, its just the first time I have done any coding for a platform
that is actually known to be portable to some extent  :-)
I have got some nice suggestions, including yours, that I will make
good use of.

Yup :)
After a few talks Jeff suggested to try using mb(); and wmb();
Doing this removed my problem. However I do not understand
completely. If the CPU just rarranged the order of the instructions
it would not freeze, just produce wrong results. So - did the
processor put two instructions - one dependent of the other into each
their pipeline, ignoring their relation, or what?  That's a very odd
thing to do... BTW, I am using an AMD K6-III.
I have got several good suggestions of how to make the code more
platform independent that I will make good use of, as I plan to make
this driver the skeleton for future drivers as well. 
I enjoy Linux a great deal after having spent some time in NDIS Hell
-a place I will never return to.
Thanks guys.
