Note: The answers to the questions below are based on my own personal
understanding of the GPL and the policies of the Linux kernel.
Also contacting a lawyer would probably not be a bad idea.

No. Applications that merely use the services the kernel provides need
not be GPL.

Again, a userspace application that merely use kernel services need not be GPL.

If the application is to be included in the mainline kernel tarball
and distributed from kernel.org, then I would say it would need to be
GPL.
If it's a tarball you provide with a modified kernel with all kernel
modifications released under GPL, then a userspace application bundled
in the tarball would not nessesarily need to be GPL.

Not in the mainline kernel.

No idea.
