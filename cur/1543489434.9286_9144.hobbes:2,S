	Ahem... There is more than one C library. There is more than one

	Say it to David. Again. And watch the result. Anyway, it's BS,
since you'll get a bloody lot of races that cannot be avoided outside of
kernel. And watch the effect if the thing will happen to contain
/proc/123/fd/4.

	Current implementation of symlinks resolving is broken, but fixes
belong to kernel, not to userland. It can (and I hope will) be done in
2.3. The Right Thing (tm): for normal symlinks add a new method that would
do kernel-space readlink (current ->readlink() actually does exactly that
and then copies the stuff to userland). Remove ->follow_link() for them -
it is nothing but kernel-space readlink() followed by lookup_dentry() (I'm
talking about the *current* code). For pseudo-symlinks in /proc leave the
stuff as-is - they can't give any recursion anyway (and are *not*
symlinks). Add a context for lookups (i.e. structure filled before call of
lookup_dentry() and containing the pointer to name + flags + credentials
of caller) (there is a lot of other reasons to do it). Keep the stack of
pointers to buffers returned by kernel-space readlink() inside that
structure. Make lookup_dentry() completely iterative. There you go - you
need 2 pointers + integer for each level of recursion (pointer to
symlink's dentry, pointer to current position in the symlink contents,
length of remaining part of said contents).
	Notice that you *can't* rely on arbitrary depth of nested symlinks
in applications - all Unices impose some limit here. You can't assume that
application will never receive ELOOP.
