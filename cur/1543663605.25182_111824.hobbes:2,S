OK.  We used to only run mark_inode_dirty() for atime updates just when it
had actually changed.  ie: once per second.  But for reasons which remain
obscure that was taken out.
This probably explains your ext3 woes.  Poor old ext3 has to do a ton of work
in ext3_mark_inode_dirty(), yet on 99% of the calls, nothing has even
changed.  Which is why I suggested that you retest ext3 with noatime.
I shall fix it up.
