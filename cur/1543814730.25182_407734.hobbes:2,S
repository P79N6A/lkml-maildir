And that's probably fine too (provided you can somehow be sure that
you're getting compound pages, which you currently can't) - you're
essentially doing your own refcounting then. However in that case you
do need to ensure get_user_pages can't operate on your mapping (use
VM_IO), because that can hijack the page lifetime (ie. hold a ref
even after all mappings have gone).

Well kmalloc is one of the possible problems I saw, but there may be
others too (eg. ioremap).
