Not really.  If a change is made to the kernel, people can't roll any
relevant changes into nvidia's driver because only nvidia has the
source.  For example, if the PCI driver interface was changed, then that
too would likely break nvidia's driver.  However, it wouldn't break the
open-source drivers because the changes would be merged into them.
As soon as nvidia releases an open-source driver, then you can blame the
kernel developers for breaking the driver.
