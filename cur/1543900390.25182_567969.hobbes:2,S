I doubt that USB suspend has any connection with this problem.  It's
clear that the problem occurs in the driver core when the SCSI core
tries to unregister a device.  It's not directly related to USB at all.
In fact, it looks like the bug is connected with 
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED.  You can try to see what happens with that 
switch disabled.
