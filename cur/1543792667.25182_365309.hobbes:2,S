I don't expect the debugger itself to be merged, but I hope the
preparatory pieces could be. And then, if not Andrew (who, as far as I
can see, picks up things from the list just as much as stuff directly
addressed to him), who would I send this to? There's doesn't seem to be
a clear maintainer of i386, for example, and that seems to be the case
for many other parts, too.
