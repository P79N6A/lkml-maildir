Hi,
I've just tried 2.6.0-test6 on my SIS630 based PIII-M laptop. I was
unable to select the trident ALSA driver for my sis7018 built in sound.
Further investigation revealed it now all of a sudden depends on the
game port being selected as well. My laptop doesn't have a game port at
all so I never built game port drivers.
Is the trident driver really dependable om the gameport? What can be a
solution here?
Thanks,
Jurgen
