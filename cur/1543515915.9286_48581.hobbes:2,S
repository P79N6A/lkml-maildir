Except ordinary synchronization is realtime friendly, what I try to
achieve with the atomic macros.

The standard is one thing, the reality is another. You should have read
enough mails on the RTLinux mailing list from people who have almost zero
kernel programming experience (e.g. because it's some university project)
and I expect a support nightmare, if they try to do the same what they
know from user space programming.

The problem is that I prefer a different design, that is better integrated
into the standard kernel.

But the problem with them is you can only create kernel level rt tasks, it
doesn't get you anything in user space.
