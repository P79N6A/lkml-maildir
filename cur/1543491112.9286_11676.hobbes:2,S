If you could track this down it would be a huge help.  Any mis-compilation of
the linux kernel is a serious issue for the egcs project, particularly for
egcs releases (less so for any given egcs development snapshot).
Even if you can just track it down to "file x when compiled with egcs results
in an unstable system" would be a big help in tracking down this problem.
