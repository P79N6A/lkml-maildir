Subject: Help: 2.4 -> 2.6 (test11,bk2) kernel module file size (due to debug options?)

Hi,
after installing (actually - creating a debian package for) 2.6.0-test11-bk2
I have this:
2.3M    /boot
366M    /lib/modules/2.6.0-test11-bk2                           !!!
15k     /usr/share/doc/kernel-image-2.6.0-test11-bk2
Almost all .ko files are >200k in size. What kernel setting is/can be
responsible for this?
N.B. I'm compiling the test11 to test it on my hardware, so ATM I'm not too
worried about size if debugging is made easier. But this is _quite_ a
drastic size increase compared to 2.4.22, where most driver files were
10-40k in size.
.config attached. Compiled cleanly, with a couple warnings. 
I'll now test it on my laptop.
Thanks!
