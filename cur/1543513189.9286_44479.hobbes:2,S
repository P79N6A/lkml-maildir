Problem: During make bzImage, arch/i386/kernel/setup.c -> Undeclared function
mem_end
Problem detail:
	While compiling the 2.3.22 kernel with the attached kernel config, I
received an error syaing that there was an undeclared function in
linux/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c. Upon reading through setup.c I determined that
the proper name for the VARIABLE that was intended was mem_end_p, a pointer,
and it was entered on line 622 and 625 as mem_end (an undeclared variable
name). After cahnging those two lines to suit the proper name the file
comp[iled without a hitch. Here is the relevent code. The line numbers for the
code are prepended to each line. (Sorry, I don't know how to make a diff.)
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce  -DCPU=686 -march=i686   -c -o setup.o setup.c
setup.c: In function `setup_arch':
setup.c:622: `memory_end' undeclared (first use in this function)
setup.c:622: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
setup.c:622: for each function it appears in.)
