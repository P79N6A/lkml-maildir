I suspect this is actually in response to the reported breakings and
external access to the M$ code base.
There have been a number of concerns about backdoors, trojan horses or
other things being maliciously added to the code base and the
resulting extreme security risk.
By 'increasing' the number or eyes that look at it, they are probably
hoping to alleviate the security concerns.
The other issue, is if it doesn't compile into the same executable, it
isn't the same code.
