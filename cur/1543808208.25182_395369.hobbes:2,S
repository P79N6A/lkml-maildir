The Intel machine that supports this will not hot-add memory in
the physical address space below 4GB, even if you only have 1GB
before hot-adding.  There are too many restrictions and gotchas
involved in the lower 4GB.  Keith has the only other machine that
I'm aware of and I would guess that machine has similar restrictions.
Keith?

I do recall a problem like that a while back where the free lists
weren't initialized properly before hot-adding.  It was fixed
when I submitted the hot-add patches, but I haven't looked in the 
past two weeks or so.

I don't currently know of one that is available, but I would 
venture a guess that we would use ACPI to notify the OS, via
the DSDT or perhaps an SSDT.
