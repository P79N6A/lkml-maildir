Please don't think that I just took your example to find a hole in it.
Actually, the reason I pointed that out was not because of "Oh, this
example is broken", but because of the description of the problem you
are trying to solve. To me, it needs to be done with a completion or
compat_semaphore otherwise it will become very complex in solving.

It should print out warnings, do you have CONFIG_DEBUG_RT_MUTEXES set?

Well, we can't determine that with code ;-)  Remember, there are still
drivers out in the world that use semaphores as mutexes. So the PI
on semaphores is really more of a compatibility issue.

Right, because a non-RT semaphore _is_ a compat_semaphore. I'm saying if
you see the bug in your driver with the compat_semaphore then lets debug
that. Because that _is_ a bug!

Not really.  There are things that the preempt-rt kernels require. One, is
that things that need to keep semaphores instead of using them as mutexes,
they should be converted to compat_semaphores.  Perhaps now that we have
mutexes, we can remove the PI on semaphores, and out-of-tree drivers will
need to make sure they don't use semaphores as mutexes anymore.

Yeah, that code is more of a hack to convert counting semaphores into
mutexes. But semaphores still need to have owners, and they should not
block on themselves. That may be where the bug is.

OK, I wont be able to work on this this weekend, but I'll try to get to it
on Monday.  A better example to show the bug you are looking for is simply
create a mutex and create a thread that grabs that mutex and goes to
sleep. Have your driver read grab that mutex with
mutex_lock_interruptible. And if the signal code is broken with this, then
you definitely got a point that the inerruptible code is broken.
This will keep the semantics clean and not obfuscate it with the semaphore
code.
I'll write up that example on Monday if you don't have the time.
Note, that the unloading of the module should wake up the thread that
grabbed the mutex so it can release it.
