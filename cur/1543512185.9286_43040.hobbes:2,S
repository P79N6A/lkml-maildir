Big fat lie. One solution to many many BIG architectural problems...

Maybe your tiny world doesn't need devfs, but it's not an
argument against it.

A guy has been continuously posting he uses USB and PCMCIA
all the time, and he as much as HAS to use devfs!0

So do that. Say CONFIG_DEVFS=N, or submit that scriptlet and

It isn't wrong now.

It's an OPTION!!!

Devices are managed by the DRIVERS.

Non issue, as you have been told a zillion times.

Almost a non-issue.

Stop spreadin falsehood, you poly sci professor!
