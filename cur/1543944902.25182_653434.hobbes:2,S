We try to get things set up pertty early ... but I agree this is
fragile.  Adding code to printk() to not provide a timestamp
before some safe point in boot is a workaround to the
current problem.  But it may come back to haunt us if
other per-cpu data is added that needs to be accessed
early during boot.
There are some changes going on at the moment on how
we allocate the space for the per-cpu area.  It is likely that
for a non-boot cpu we might be able to get everything that
we need for per-cpu access to work done in head.S before
we can get to any C code.  Boot cpu may be harder unless
we statically allocate space for its per-cpu area in
vmlinux.lds.S
I'll take a closer look at what is needed tomorrow.
