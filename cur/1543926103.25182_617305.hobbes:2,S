After some bisection pain (sg broken in the middle and XFS not
compiling in other places) the regression seems to be:

	[XFS] use filldir internally
There have been a lot of changes since this so reverting it and
retesting as-is won't work. I'll have to see what I can come up with
after some sleep.
I'm not building/testing with dmapi --- perhaps that makes a
difference here?  I would think it would have broken with xfsqa but
the number of bug reports seems small so far.
