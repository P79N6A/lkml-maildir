Just an idea. What about throttling runaway RT tasks?
If the system spend more than 98% in RT tasks for 5s consider this as a
_fatal error_. Print an error message and throttle RT tasks by inserting
ticks where only SCHED_OTHER tasks allowed. For a limit of 98% this
means one SCHED_OTHER only tick all 50 ticks.
The limit and timeout should be configurable and of course it can be
disabled.
I know this is against RT task preempt all SCHED_OTHER but this is only
for a fatal system state to be able to recover sanely. A locked up
machine is is the worse alternative.
