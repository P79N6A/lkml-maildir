I don't see how one can magically tell that this is an NVIDIA problem. 
I am contacting NVIDIA at the same time and it's possible that the 
problem is with their drivers. However, there is something going on 
in the kernel and I imagine that even if the NVIDIA drivers are 
triggering the problem, there are other modules/apps that can bring 
about the same behavior.
