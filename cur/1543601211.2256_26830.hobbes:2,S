Hmm, I have a "KT133 Athlon Norbridge, Preliminary Revision 1.0 May 12, 2000"
PDF. Register 55 is described like this :
Device 0 Offset 55  Debug .............................................. RW
	7-5	Reserved (do not program)...................... default = 0
	4	Write Policy for CPU Write to DRAM
		0	Issue DRAM write when FIFO holds more
			than two requests of DRAM controller idle . def
		1	Disable Write Policy
	3-0	Reserved (do not program)...................... default = 0
Which doesn't explain things much more since the bits in question (7, 3, 0) is
marked as "Reserved".
I also have a question; if "movntq; sfence" type of memory copy can cause data
corruption in kernel space, it can in theory also do so in user space right ?
So, if I'm right this bug could also be on machines running a 2.2 kernel with
userspace programs using 3DNow (or SSE even) instructions.
