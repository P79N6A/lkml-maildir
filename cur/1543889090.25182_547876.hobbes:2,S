Here's a short hacky testcase that trips the assert around line 123 of
udf/truncate.c  I'm looking into it but you may immediately see what the
problem is...?
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
        int fd;
        char buf[65536];
        fd = open("testfile", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT);
        lseek(fd, 16797, SEEK_SET);
        write(fd, buf, 22935);
        close(fd);
        fd = open("testfile", O_WRONLY);
        lseek(fd, 31281, SEEK_SET);
        write(fd, buf, 9592);
        close(fd);
}
