Hello,
here are some probable bugs :
(line numbers are from 2.4.12-ac3)
* drivers/telephony/ixj.c : unknown directive in line 390
-> should be #define
* drivers/acorn/scsi/ecoscsi.c : #endif missing at the end of file
-> the #if directive is in line 235
* drivers/scsi/dpt_i2o.c : Expression expected in #elif at lines 83 and 1804
->  "defined"
* drivers/media/video/planb.c : #endif unexpected out of an #if at line 69
-> line 67 should be "#else" (not #endif)
