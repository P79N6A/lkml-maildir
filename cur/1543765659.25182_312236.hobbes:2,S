hi, everyone, 
Recently, I program a script like NAT, but I have no idea how to let it 
possess more cpu resource?
you know, in user space process is a small unit which possess the cpu 
and is controlled by schedule function.  but in kernel space, it seems 
not the same thing as it in user space, and NAT should not be viewed as 
a process, in turn I can not schedule it. 
I ought to alter my perspective to the driver like ? while , I 
realistically can not understand it.
Any help will be appreciated!
thanks , :)
