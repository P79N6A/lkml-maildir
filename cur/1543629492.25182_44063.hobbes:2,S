My apologies, this is an unexpected side effect of a change in modutils
2.4.13.  Christian Lademann asked that depmod do as much work as
possible instead of exiting early.  That meant checking the error count
at the end of depmod and giving a non-zero return if any errors were
detected.  depmod before 2.4.13 ignored the return code from the
loadobj() function, with the 2.4.13 change the ignored error flag was
being used.
I will revert to ignoring the loadobj() return code for error purposes
in modutils 2.4.17.  The behavior is wrong but it is what people
expect.
