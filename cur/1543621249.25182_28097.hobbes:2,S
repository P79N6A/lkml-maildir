It's good that Gerd has made his change, but we don't know who else
might have been doing similar.  unmap_kiobuf does not involve unmapping
virtual address space: it used to be safe run from irq handlers, now not.
We don't have to make a change for 2.4.18, but we really should add some
kind of safety check there in 2.4.soon: either of the "it's a BUG()"
kind I first suggested (which may embarrass us by firing too often),
or of the "we can handle that" kind which I last suggested.
I don't disagree with Andrew's and your count-LRU approach,
but it does have slight drawbacks, as you noted.

That's just a hope: you may be right, we simply don't know.
