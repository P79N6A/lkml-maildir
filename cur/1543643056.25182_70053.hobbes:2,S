Audio-entropyd has been enhanced; it now adds entropy to the
kernel when it's neccessary. This reduces the load which older
versions gave to the machine. Good for busy webservers and
such.
Don't worry; this will be the last time I'm announcing audio-
and video-entropyd. It's just that you know it's there.
