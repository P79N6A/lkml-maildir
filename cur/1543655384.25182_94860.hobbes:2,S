Testing the algorithm on idle test processes won't show
this damn-obvious race condition:
1. you read the first thread's info
2. the second thread calls mmap() and/or takes a page fault
3. you read the second thread's info

This forces sorting, which is slow and eats memory.
It's better to list the ->mm peers in a proc file.
For example, a /proc/42/mm-peers file containing
a simple list of the peers.
There's still a race condition, but at least it only
involves threads that get created during the /proc scan.
There's also the problem with new-style threads simply not
being listed anywhere. Crackers are going to love it if
the Linux 2.6 kernel has a built-in way to hide things.
