oh, you are writing the number-cruncher? In general the 'best' 
performance metrics for scheduler validation are the ones where you have 
immediate feedback: i.e. some ops/sec (or ops per minute) value in some 
readily accessible place, or some "milliseconds-per-100,000 ops" type of 
metric - whichever lends itself better to the workload at hand. If you 
measure time then the best is to use long long and nanoseconds and the 
monotonic clocksource:
 unsigned long long rdclock(void)
 {
	struct timespec ts;
	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts);
        return ts.tv_sec * 1000000000ULL + ts.tv_nsec;
 }
(link to librt via -lrt to pick up clock_gettime())
The cost of a clock_gettime() (or of a gettimeofday()) can be a couple 
of microseconds on some systems, so it shouldnt be done too frequently.
Plus an absolute metric of "the whole workload took X.Y seconds" is 
useful too.
