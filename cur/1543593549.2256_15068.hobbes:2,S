Hmmm....so my 512M laptop only really has 256M?  Um...I regularlly run
more than 256M of programs.  I don't want it to swap -- its a special, weird
condition if I do start swapping.  I don't want to waste 1G of HD (5%) for
something I never want to use.  IRIX runs just fine with swap<RAM.  In
Irix, your Virtual Memory = RAM + swap.  Seems like the Linux kernel requires
more swap than other old OS's (SunOS3 (virtual mem = min(mem,swap)).
I *thought* I remember that restriction being lifted in SunOS4 when they
upgraded the VM.  Even though I worked there for 6 years, that was
6 years ago...

    Other OS's don't have this pathological 'worst case' scenario.  Even
my Windows [vm]box seems to operate fine with swap<MEM.  On IRIX,
virtual space closely approximates physical + disk memory.

    Okay, admission of ignorance.  When we speak of "swap space",
is this term inclusive of both demand paging space and
swap-out-entire-programs space or one or another?
