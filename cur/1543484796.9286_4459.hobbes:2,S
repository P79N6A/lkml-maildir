Subject: Miro PCTV; Channel selection malfunction (xawtv) 2.2pre9-2.2.1-ac4

I've been using 2.2 and before 2.1 for some time. Hardly ever having
problems, but since (around 2.2pre8 or 9) my Miro PCTV(bt848)  stopped
reacting to
channel selections.
I'm now using 2.2.1-ac4 and have used about any kernel in between, but
still I can't change channels. Strange thing is that it does react to
input changes (Switching from Television to Composite).
Normally the image is just 'snow' but sometime I have (a little of sync) a
channel (probably a random channel after boot-time).
All messages (kernel-log as wel as xawtv-bootup) seem to be just fine.
Could it be that some Major's and Minor's have been changed for devices
(or support for depricated devices has been removed)?
I also recall some fixes done for some hauppage cards. Maybe they conflict
with the Miro PCTV??
If somebody knows how to fix this, I would appreciate hearing it.
