hi all,
I have two  physical harddisks /dev/hda1 and /hdb
1) i want to copy drive (take backup) to a file ( in /hdb)using dd.
So how much space( in terms percentage)more is required in /hdb
for it to be copied successfully.
2) After copying using dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/hdb/backup
how to retrive it back again in terms of directories and sub-directories
and files.
thank u all

vasu
