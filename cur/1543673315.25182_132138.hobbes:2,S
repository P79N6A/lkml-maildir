This is ridiculous. Just make sure you're not sharing interrupts and
count cycles starting at the ISR instead of wakeup and tag events
properly if you truly believe that to be your metric. You, as the
kernel, are notified whenever the interrupts occur and can just look
at the time of day and cycle counts.
