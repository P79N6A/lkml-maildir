I'd like most of you to answer the following question, that includes even 
Linus.
I love C programming at low level (ie kernel, embedded, etc) and i'm seriously 
good at it. But don't know whether I should persue it as my main Career or 
just as an Interest. My question is, is there, yet, any area at this low 
level to be discovered and developed on ? or as most ppl say, are the 
interesting parts over and it's just now into patches, bugs and slight 
enhancements/optimizations/securities ?
I'm starting a Post-Graduate studies at April, and need to know, whether it's 
worth going into Computer Architecture Group as my main career, or shall I 
stir towards a another area like networking which is still in developement, 
and plenty of jobs (but not as interssting as kernel/OS programming) ?????
please reply, and if in favor of kernel developement, try to name some areas 
where there yet relies hope.
Thanks,
Shane
