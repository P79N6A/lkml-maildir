hey all,
I'm getting the above error with out of the box SuSE 8.2 when doing an
insmod - which is *really* confusing to me, because I thought
that 'schedule' was a low-level, linux API call and that modules that you
inserted automatically linked with the kernel.
so.. what the hell is going on here? When I say:
insmod <module_name>
what exactly does insmod do to resolve symbols? And how can you figure out
what symbols are present in the kernel itself? ( I suppose, for instance
that SuSE has another name for the schedule system call - but that's
unlinkely since I've seen the error crop up from time to time on usenet.
No
history on how to solve it though :( )
