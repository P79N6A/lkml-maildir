It is now.  On behalf of native speakers of English I hereby welcome the 
phrasal verb
"fix out" to the language.  I even offer a defintion and an etymological 
reference:
fix out: To fix or repair by removing.  E.g. "It doesn't matter if we 
track who fixed
out spelling errors." (Torvalds, lkml,  2004)
See, it's official now.
