I in fact have seen bugs with mixed reads and writes to the same cr,
(cr4), but adding the volatile
flag to the read function seemed to fix it. Yet, I agree with you that
the theorectical problem exists for the reorder, and your proposed fix
seems fine (although if we're really desperate about memory usage, we
can use a char instead a int and save 3 bytes!)
It also just ocurred to me that this part of the patch can also go into
the consolidation part. So I'll respin it.
Thanks for the comment
