I flashed to bios to latest yesterday, but to no avail. There are no
options remotely connected to this in the setup menu :-(
Now, I don't mean to sound rude but I would like to know what changed,
as speedstep was working well in kernel 2.6.15, so my initial thoughts
contain the word regression. I still thank you for your interest though.
My best regards,
