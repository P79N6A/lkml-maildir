What do the crash traces look like

Maybe you need to have a chat with your hardware guys. Certainly if
inb_p makes a difference you've got hardware not software side problems.

Unlikely as it would affect both. More likely would be that the ISA bus
clock is generated off the PCI bus clock and you have one of the
multipliers wrong or too high for the board.

That bit is interesting. Something really off the wall to try - disable
interrupts around the inb_p(), especially if you are using pre-emption
and let me know what happens.
