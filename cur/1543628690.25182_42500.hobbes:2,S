I updated my patch that allows to mount unholy numbers of volumes.
The old version was for 2.4.9 and did not apply anymore.
I split the unnamed majors patch and the NFS patch.
Also, CONFIG_ option is gone, because it made the code ugly.
Majors part:

NFS part:

Userland for NFS:

Is anyone actually interested? Random people periodically ask
me for patches, get them and disappear into the void. I hear
nothing good or bad (well, nothing since Trond reviewed it
several months ago, and also someone found a conflict with NFS
server code, since fixed). I am thinking about submitting,
but if users do not ask, why add extra bloat and negotiate
with LANANA...
