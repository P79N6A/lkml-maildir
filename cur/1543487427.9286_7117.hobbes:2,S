To make this work, you have to be using an old LILO (I don't know which
version caused the bug) or LILO 0.21 or above.
The LILO distributed with RH 5.2 (and probably other systems) is "broken"
for NT because it changes the last few bytes of the boot sector so they
don't match what NT expects. Interestingly enough, and I don't fully
understand it so I may be wrong, Microsoft may be correct on this one.
Regardless, according to the release notes, it's fixed in 0.21.
