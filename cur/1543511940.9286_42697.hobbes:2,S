Hi,
	I had problems with 2.2.12 and IPX broadcast and couldn't find a
msg pointing a final solution for it in lists archives. Maybe I missed
something in the search engine. So, I'm asking here: is ipx overbroadcast
solved? By which patch? 
	Other minor questions: how do I apply the patches from, e.g., Alan
Cox directory? Does patch-kernel script handle them? Do I need to apply,
e.g., all 2.2.12pre and them some from 2.2.13pre? What's the rule here?
	TIA.
