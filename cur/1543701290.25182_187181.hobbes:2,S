The current Linux driver (well, my sata_sil at least) doesn't work for 
several situations, at the moment :)  I need to handle the watchdog 
timer, and also need to mask a bunch of SATA-phy-specific interrupts.
Now that I see in the docs that these bits are present in the stock 
3112, it makes sense to unconditionally ensure they are clear, thus 
completely eliminating the BIOS from the equation.
