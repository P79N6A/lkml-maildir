Hi Jun,
the patch I submitted is for icc 8.0, i.e. I386 platform only.
Did I understand your last message right that you even do not
need a kernel patch for icc, i.e. I386?
If so, then try to compile the 2.6.3 kernel using icc without
applying my patch and see what happens if icc "tries" to compile
hybrid code, i.e. mixed assembly and C statements....
The current icc 8.0 (and also icc 7.0) makes FATAL mistakes
compiling those mixings. Just check the object file that results
from "dec_and_lock.c" in arch/i386/lib using a disassembler.
Rgs, Ingo.

In 2.6, we already have sufficient changes for Intel IPF Compiler to
build the kernel, especially intrinscs changes, and you should not need
a patch. To make it faster, we might want to use PGO (profile guided
optimization) provided by the compiler; yes, it's available even for the
kernel with a driver.
Thanks,
Jun
