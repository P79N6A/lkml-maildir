Nothing should be including {asm,linux}/a.out.h unless it absolutely needs it.
I removed all the places it did so extraneously, after moving out STACK_TOP.

It compiles for all the archs for which I have a compiler, and the x86_64 and
i386 kernels all build and boot for the following combinations of AOUT
configs:
	x86_64	CONFIG_IA32_AOUT=n
		CONFIG_IA32_AOUT=y
		CONFIG_IA32_AOUT=m
	i386	CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT=n
		CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT=y
		CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT=m
It seems I had forgetten to include:
	config ARCH_SUPPORTS_AOUT
		def_bool y
in arch/x86/Kconfig, but it builds without that too for both subarchs.
The kernel also builds and boots for MN10300 and FRV.
The problem is that your -mm patchset doesn't match Linus's as a base.  I'm
still not sure what the right procedure is for that.  I can give you some
altered patches, but there's no guarantee you'll be able to pass them on to
Linus without breaking his tree.  What do *you* want?
