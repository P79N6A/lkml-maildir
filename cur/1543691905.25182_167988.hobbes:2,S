Alan,
Thanks for the suggestion, certainly works far better than before. 
Disabling DMA on IDE does allow me to boot right up.  I was able to use 
up2date and install the 2.4.20-20.9 kernel.  I then made a new bootdisk 
using mkbootdisk.  Booting using the new kernel from floppy got a bit 
further, it actually loaded the kernel fro /dev/hdb2.  But hung after it 
got to "Enabling Swap ..".   Any more ideas?
I am now about to copy the boot sector using dd and using Win-XP's 
loader to load it to see if it helps.
Should I be using an even newer kernel?  Which one is known to work with 
RH-9 (I haven't kept up with building kernels and libc compatibilities 
in a long time, not since Slackware '97 days :-)?
