What does "increased top mem usage" mean? You have given no reason to
suggest that there's anything unusual about this.
Here's one theory: Some program is writing these kernel messages to a file.
Because some other process might come and read that file later, the kernel
keeps copies of the file data in memory.
The kernel sees no advantage in having memory free. Free memory is memory
that's not doing any good. Better to keep data in memory that might be
useful later. We can always free the memory later if (and only if) we have
something better to do with it.
