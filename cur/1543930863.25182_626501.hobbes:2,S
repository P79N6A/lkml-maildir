For newer CPUs udelay() would be probably fine though. We seem
to have several documented examples now where the bus aborts
trigger hardware bugs, and it is always better to avoid such situations.
I still think the best strategy would be to switch based on TSC
availability. Perhaps move out*_p out of line to avoid code bloat.
