Sorry if this is a known problem or I am doing something trivial wrong.
I did this:
  # ifconfig sit0 up
  # ifconfig sit0 tunnel ::10.0.0.1
  SIOCSIFDSTADDR: No buffer space available
  # 
What's wrong?  I am using 2.4.0-test8 for this.  The same chain of
commands works without error on 2.2.17 on another machine.  I am using
ifconfig 1.40 from net-tools 1.57.
