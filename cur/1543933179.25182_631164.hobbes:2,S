Subject: [PATCH 3/9] readahead: auto detection of sequential mmap reads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Auto-detect sequential mmap reads and do sync/async readahead for them.
The sequential mmap readahead will be triggered when
- sync readahead: it's a major fault and (prev_offset==offset-1);
- async readahead: minor fault on PG_readahead page with valid readahead state.
It's a bit conservative to require valid readahead state for async readahead,
which means we don't do readahead for interleaved reads for now, but let's make
it safe for this initial try.
======
The benefits of doing readahead instead of read-around:
- less I/O wait thanks to async readahead
- double real I/O size and no more cache hits
Some numbers on 100,000 sequential mmap reads:
                                    user       system    cpu        total
(1-1)  plain -mm, 128KB readaround: 3.224      2.554     48.40%     11.838
(1-2)  plain -mm, 256KB readaround: 3.170      2.392     46.20%     11.976
(2)  patched -mm, 128KB readahead:  3.117      2.448     47.33%     11.607
The patched (2) has smallest total time. It has no cache hit overheads
and less I/O block time(thanks to async readahead). Here the I/O size
makes no much difference, since there's only one single stream.
Note that (1-1)'s real I/O size is 64KB and (1-2)'s real I/O size is
128KB, since the half of the read-around pages will be cache hits.
