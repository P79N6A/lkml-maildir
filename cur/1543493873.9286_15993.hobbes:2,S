Subject: SCSI dead lock on 2.0.36 kernel with buslogic SCSI driver !!!

I have tryed to setup the most reliable disk server I could.
The selected configuration is:
- 350 Mhz pentium II based PC from Dell
- 2.0.36 stock kernel
- / and swap mounted on the EIDE internal disk
- Buslogic BT958 SCSI controler
- 4 x 45 Gb disks
- 2 x 8 Gb disks
- 3C905 ethernet card
- UPS
the disks are linked to the controler with short and high
quality cables.
I selected maximum performances on the SCSI controler Bios
which means fast wild 40 Mb/s.
The system is quite loaded, and has worked for more than a month
without failure (OS/2 advanced server was down roughly once a week).
This morning, the system was locked.
By lock, I mean that some disks where locked ('ls' or 'umount' would
never return)
On the other hand, the rest of the system was working fine: I could
remotely log on the machine using vnc, get a new shell, run the
'reboot' command which did not work, probably because it got locked
trying to umoung some disk.
If this happends once more, is there anything I should type berore
rebooting the server that could help track the bug in the SCSI
driver or SCSI kernel subsystem ?
I thought the buslogic driver was the most reliable one for Linux.
Would there be an even more reliable one ?
