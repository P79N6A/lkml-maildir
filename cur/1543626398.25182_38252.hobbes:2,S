	No.  Not a joke.  An April Fools day tradition going back many

	Does anyone have a complete set of Linus' "I'm quiting Linux"
April 1 postings?  I'm sure I can dig the recent few years out of the
archives...  They rank (in both sense of the word) right up there with
the annual April 1 RFCs...  What is this years?  "Electricity over IP"
I think?
