the old data got flushed below the i_size anyways, it sounds very
strange that confidential data is present only over the i_size and not
below the i_size, and if this guy has confidential data below the i_size
then it'd better memset the whole page. And in theory nobody should touch
the data over the i_size even if mmap allows to map it.
