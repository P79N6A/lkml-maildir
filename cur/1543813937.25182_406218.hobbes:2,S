Still seems wrong.  People _do_ use HOTPLUG_CPU on X86_PCs so they can get
software suspend.  The number of people who do this are probably 100000x
the number of people who have physically hotpluggable CPUs.  And I don't
think we can churn their config requirements this much so late in the game.
So for now I suggest we're best off simply killing the printk (or doing
something smarter, like comparing cpu_online-map with cpu_possible_map
(which isn't right)).
Longer term, it appears that we need to do some Kconfig and C work to
separate out the HOTPLUG_CPU infrastructure which swsusp needs from actual
CPU hotplugging.
What _is_ this IPI problem anyway?  Can't send point-to-point IPIs to
offlined CPUs?  (Don't do that then?) Or do broadcast IPIs go wrong, or
what?
And does it affect pretend-x86-hotplug, or is it only affecting real hotplug?
Thanks.
