Ok.  I wonder if it would be saner to simply replace the nmi trap
handler on the crash dump path?

Oh I agree.  If we had a private 4K stack for the nmi handler we
would not need to worry about overflow in that case.  (baring
nmi happening during nmis)  Hmm.  Is there anything to keep
us doing something bad in that case?
I guess as long as we don't clear the high bit of port 0x70 we
should be reasonably safe from the nmi firing multiple times.
