Thank you very much, Arjan, for your review of our code and your
extensive comments. We are working on taking them into account for the
next attempt at submitting the driver. Most of them are quite clear and
don't need discussing. Just a few remarks and questions:

I see. We'll try to reduce our atomic consumption. :-)

So you are saying that, for example
	spin_lock_irqsave(&cs->ev_lock, flags);
	head = cs->ev_head;
	tail = cs->ev_tail;
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&cs->ev_lock, flags);
is (mutatis mutandis) actually cheaper than
	head = atomic_read(&cs->ev_head);
	tail = atomic_read(&cs->ev_tail);
? That's interesting. I wouldn't have expected that after reading
Documentation/atomic_ops.txt and Documentation/spinlock.txt.

Ok, these were mainly debugging aids. We'll just drop them and let the
oops mechanism catch the (hopefully non-existent) remaining cases of
pointers being unexpectedly NULL.

Are you referring to anything in particular? We do run sparse regularly,
and it did not emit any warnings for the submitted version, not even for
this function. (But heaps of them for other parts of the kernel, if you
pardon the remark.)

Sorry but no - this is executed within a tasklet.

Does that mean that every function doing kmalloc() and which may be
called from both interrupt and non-interrupt context needs a gfp_t flags
argument?
Thanks again for your time and effort
