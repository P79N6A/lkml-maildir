Clearing PG_emergency would mean kmem_is_emergency() would return false
in kfree_reserve() and fail to un-charge the object.
Previously objects would track their account status themselves (when
needed) and freeing PG_emergency wouldn't be a problem.

Not sure I understand this properly. We would only do this once the page
watermarks are high enough, so the reserves are full again.

Well, I agree with that consolidating it makes sense. And like I said,
it gives pretty code. However, it also puts the burden of this feature
on everyone and might affect performance - still its only the slow path,
but still.
