I don't know it anymore but it was something with wrong mtime or something... sorry
I've started 2.5.4-dj2 a few seconds ago and the files were created again... but this time I've tar them up. Please take a look at it
but the strangest thing was: the files didn't go away after rebooting into 2.4.17...

OK I'll try it but I think there's something you should know...
When I start the gnome-terminal from a panel launcher the window just pops up and exits then...
When I start the gnome-terminal from console the window pops up and nothing happens... no shell get loaded
But now I try to find out where it hangs or exits
