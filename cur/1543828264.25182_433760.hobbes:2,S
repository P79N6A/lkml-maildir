Via /proc/pid/cpu_rate_cap.  Important detail, that.
People are going to want to extend this to capping a *group* of tasks, with
some yet-to-be-determined means of tying those tasks together.  How well
suited is this code to that extension?
If the task can exceed its cap without impacting any other tasks (ie: there
is spare idle capacity), what happens?  I trust that spare capacity gets
used?  (Is this termed "work conserving"?)

hm.  That seems rather a lot.  I guess it's not a simple thing to do.
