Applied.
Martin, please be careful with future patch submissions, your
email client corrupted up the patch by adding newlines and
changing tab characters into spaces, so I had to add the patch
by hand.
Herbert, this fix is only needed for 2.6.20 correct?  I assume
it was added by the 2.6.20 crypto layer merge, right?
Thanks.
