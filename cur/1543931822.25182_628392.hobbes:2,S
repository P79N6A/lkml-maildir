I will be very interested in Michael's answer to this question; however, my experience is that it 
doesn't make much difference if your device is supported by both V3 and V4 firmware. This impression 
was obtained by comparing BCM4318 and BCM4311/1 devices with b43 and b43legacy.
Note that 802.11b and early BCM4306 devices are not supported by V4 firmware. Similarly, with 
BCM4311/2 and newer devices V3 firmware fails. As Michael said "newer drivers supporting newer 
hardware need newer firmware".
