Yes, businesses do go under.  Look at Cyclic.  We've spent more on BK
development than they made in their entire history.
If _you_, my friend, and all of your buddies had been throwing money at
Cyclic, then perhaps they would have had the resources to solve the hard
problems (and believe me, they are hard).
CVS has had 10 years or so to get it right and they didn't.  And you didn't
help, in spite of your assertions that it is "a very insignificant problem".

Uh huh.  Sure.

I'm sure you do.  Perhaps that is some indication of your incredible 
grasp of the difficulties involved.

Yes they do.  That Windows garbage will generate the revenue to make the
product better and to make other products.  All of which the Linux 
community gets for free.  So it's true they don't care directly, but
somebody has to do the work and if Windows ends up paying to make Linux
get better tools, are you seriously going to suggest that people are 
going to be unhappy with that?

I'm not belittling anyone.  I'm holding Peter accountable, just as he would
hold me accountable if the situation were reversed.  If he wants to step
up to the plate with a real solution, why hasn't he?  I'm not the guy who
started this thread, nor am I the guy with the market spiel.  I was happily
working on code when this started and I'll be hapily working on code when 
it is done.
Look, I don't really care who solves problems, I only care that they
get solved.  If I thought that Aegis could do the job, I would have
encouraged its use myself.  And that is still the case.  If Peter could
produce a product which Linus thinks solves the problems, well, hell,
that frees me and my team up to go do something else.  Like clusters,
which are a ton sexier than source management.  But I'm sick to death
of people saying "Oh, this system could solve the problem" when that 
isn't true.
Just out of curiousity, Edward, what's the biggest project you've managed
under Aegis?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the system in
your experience?
