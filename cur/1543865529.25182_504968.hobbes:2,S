Setthing them as well will cause no problems.
ATA_PIIX drives the Intel PIIX3,PIIX4,ICH series of devices both in PATA
and SATA mode
PATA_MPIIX drives the original mobile PIIX
PATA_OLDPIIX drives the PIIX (the original not PIIX3,4, etc)
People do find that confusing so if there is any rewording for
Configure.help that would have made it easier and more obvious let me know
