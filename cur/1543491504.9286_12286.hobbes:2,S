Hallo!
At first: Yes, I'm using bzImage.
The "out of memory" condition happens in the malloc() code in
arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c which means that the HEAP_SIZE
for the decompressing structures is too small.
Some debugging outputs of the pointer show the following behavior:
free_mem_ptr at		size to allocated	free_mem_end_ptr
start of malloc
----------------------------------------------------------------
.
<some allocations and releases back to 0x86a0>
.
0xa170			0x18			0xa6a0
0xa188			0x18
.
.
.
0xa200			0x18
0xa218			0x28
.
.
.
0xa330			0x28
0xa358			0x108
0xa460			0x208			0xa6a0
0xa668			0x88   <- out of memory
The strange thing is that it seems to heavily depend on the gzipped
kernel image itself if an out of memory happens. During the addition
of the debugging output in misc.c it sometimes works and sometimes
not. This happened to me with various recent kernel versions, too.
The malloc(0x88) seems to be the last allocation before the release of the
malloc buffers again as if I interpret the other allocation patterns
before, so the heap is probably only about 100 bytes too low.
Could somebody with knowledge in inflate.c confirm that the heap buffer
size of 8192 bytes is insufficient and raise this limit to a safe value?
Does it harm if it is set to - say - 0x2400 bytes?
Thanks in advance,
	Matze
P.S.: I've attached the diff of misc.c that I'm using for debugging. A
      workaround without raising the heap limit is included, too (always
      remember the last allocated pointer and release this memory if free
      is called with this pointer - this frees the first allocation and
      saves 520 - 1032 bytes).
