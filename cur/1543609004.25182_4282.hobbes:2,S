There are other much more immediate obstacles: opening /dev/* is not
possible if the devices beneath the inodes don't exist.
O_OPENONLY (implying neither read nor write access) to get a stub file
handle for such inodes is possible, if a bit hackish.  There's a
problem in the kernel there --- kernel file descriptor operations on
"special" inodes such as named sockets/pipes or device nodes don't
pass file operations on to the underlying filesystem.  
As long as you're doing the ACL stuff via inode operations internally,
that's not a problem.  However, inode operations generally don't take
a file descriptor as an argument so you don't have access to the
cursor in that case.
The DMAPI and special inode problems go away if you don't demand a
file descriptor to the file.  (Having a file descriptor that
specifically belongs to the ACL stream is a different matter
entirely.)
