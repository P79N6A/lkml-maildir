Unfortunately, that doesn't work. Doing it that way means that any
program running on a host whose terminfo is so configured, would force
UTF-8 mode on, when it issues a reset to a Linux console, regardless of
which machine that is on (e.g. telnet, ssh,...). Furthermore, it would do
so regardless of whether we want UTF-8 mode, or not. Again with my patch
it is a user configurable matter whether they want UTF-8 or not. This
terminfo entry forces it to happen.
That said, I am planning a whole bunch of other changes to terminfo; my
repeated wrestling with xterm recently on the regard of modified cursor
keys (e.g. Ctrl+left) has lead me to conclude the whole system needs a
bit of an overhaul... But that's somewhat off-topic to the kernel.. :)
