The time requester is a router. I looked up
it's configuration and indeed TIME/UDP is the
protocol used.
You are right, I mixed up ntp with time. Sorry.
So, the corretced message is ..
I noticed a huge cpu usage of xinetd with 2.6.14-rc4
starting with the first time/udp request.
I will try older rc's today to narrow the point in time
this problem started.
