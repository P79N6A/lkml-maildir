If it's an old system, it probably doesn't have working ACPI C-states 
though.  Without that, low HZ does not save you anything.  I should have 
said: 99% of desktops with the capability to do ACPI sleep have at least 
one USB device attached (usually a mouse).
I do like saving power, which is why I run cpu frequency scaling on 
every machine I have that supports it.  I'm happy because it does its 
savings without negatively impacting latency or high-load performance. 
By 2.6.14 dyntick should give us the same thing for HZ, which is why I 
think changing the maximum value now doesn't make sense.
