you can do it without a rebuild -- that's in fact how i did it the first 
time.
to add an external bitmap:
mdadm --grow --bitmap /bitmapfile /dev/mdX
plus add "bitmap=/bitmapfile" to mdadm.conf... as in:
ARRAY /dev/md4 bitmap=/bitmap.md4 UUID=dbc3be0b:b5853930:a02e038c:13ba8cdc
you can also easily move an ext3 journal to an external journal with 
tune2fs (see man page).
if you use XFS it's a bit more of a challenge to convert from internal to 
external, but see this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-xfs&m=106929781232520&w=2
i found that i had to do "sb 1", "sb 2", ..., "sb N" for all sb rather 
than just the "sb 0" that email instructed me to do.
