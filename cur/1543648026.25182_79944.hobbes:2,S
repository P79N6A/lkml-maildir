It won't quite work if the hooks can sleep.  You can say "don't sleep"
or have a wedge which does the "try_inc_mod_count()" then calls into
the module (and returns some default if it can't inc the module count).
You can't disable preemption before calling in, because there is no
way to sleep with preemption disabled. 8(
