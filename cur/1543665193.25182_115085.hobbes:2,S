No no no.  Martin's point shows exactly that nothing but the kernel can
ever know whether a task is I/O or CPU bound.  What is bash?  Is it
interactive (when you are typing into it) or CPU bound (when its running
a script or doing other junk)?
Only the kernel knows exactly the sleep patterns of tasks, which is
essentially whether or not a task is interactive.
Finally, the windows manager idea is bad.  The foreground window may
have dependencies elsewhere, and giving it a boost only partially solves
the problem.
I think with Linus's patch, the problem is solved, because we boost both
I/O-bound tasks and tasks that help I/O bound tasks.
