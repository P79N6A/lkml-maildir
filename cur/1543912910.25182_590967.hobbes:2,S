... But is it _ethical_ (as opposed to legal) to violate the expressed 
intent of the original author ...
IP laws (including copyright) are generally used as an imperfect (and 
internationally inconsistent) mechanism to protect intent, but inexact 
application of those laws affects enforcement as law ... however, 
respect for intent remains the ethical standard by which I (for one) 
would prefer to govern my life.
