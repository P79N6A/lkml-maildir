   type abuse aside, and alpha bugs aside, this looks ok... what is the
   value of as->msize?
Jeff and Jeff, the problem is one of two things:
1) when you have ~2GB of memory the vmalloc pool is very small
   and this it the same place ioremap allocations come from
2) the BIOS or Linus is not assigning resources of the device
   properly, or it simple can't because the available PCI MEM space
   with this much memory is too small
I note that one of the resources of the card is 16MB or so.
