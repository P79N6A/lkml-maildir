yes, 2.6.18.1 require notsc to work properly , but without notsc boots
normally but with  many lost timer ticks 
    time.c: Lost 300 timer tick(s)! rip mwait_idle+0x3f/0x54)
    psmouse.c: Wheel Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost
synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
    time.c: Lost 300 timer tick(s)! rip mwait_idle+0x3f/0x54)
booting with clocksource=acpi_pm , don't find/use   acpi_pm
cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource
