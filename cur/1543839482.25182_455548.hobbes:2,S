Okay, then it should stay where it is.

Hmm, in that case why does break_ctl do this:
+       lcr = serial_in(sport, PNX8XXX_LCR);
+       if (break_state == -1)
+               lcr |= PNX8XXX_UART_LCR_TXBREAK;
+       else
+               lcr &= ~PNX8XXX_UART_LCR_TXBREAK;
+       serial_out(sport, PNX8XXX_LCR, lcr);
which appears to imply that the bit for the break state is in the LCR.
Moreover, there isn't a PNX8XXX_INT_* bit defined for break.  Confused.
