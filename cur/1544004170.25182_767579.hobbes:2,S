Peter Z. beat you to it.  ;-)

Ah!
I would like to see the value of rcu_ctrlblk.cpumask and also the value
of cpu_online_map.  One guess would be that rcu_ctrlblk.cpumask has a
bit set that is -not- set in cpu_online_map, which would indicate that
RCU was incorrectly waiting on an offline CPU.
On the other hand, if all the bits set in rcu_ctrlblk.cpumask are also
set in cpu_online_map, then could you please dump out the instances of
the rcu_data per-CPU variable that correspond to the bits set in
rcu_ctrlblk.cpumask?
Finally, if no bits are set in rcu_ctrlblk.cpumask, the question would
be "why isn't the synchronize_sched() waking up?"
BTW, I am assuming that you have the same config as Raphael, in other
words, that you are running Classic RCU rather than preemptable RCU.
The point of the patch is that it allows you to see this info by catting
out the /debug/rcu files, at least assuming that the system is healthy
enough to allow you to cat files.  But if you already have a crash dump...
