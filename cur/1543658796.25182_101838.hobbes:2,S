For what it is worth these cards exist though.
Quadris cards have a 256MB bar, and dolphin cards default to having a 512MB bar.
Both are high performance I/O adapters.

If someone leaves a big enough hole for hotplug cards I guess it can work...
How you define a potential boot device, and what it saves you to not assign
it resources I don't know.  
I am still recovering from putting a 256MB bar and 4GB of ram in a 4GB hole,
with minimal loss on x86, so my imagination of what can be sanely done
on a 64bit arch may be a little stunted..
