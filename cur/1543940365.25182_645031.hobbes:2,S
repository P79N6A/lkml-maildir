Yes, but your patch also makes users who need extended PCI config space suffer.
Right now, that isn't a lot of people in x86 land, but your patch encumbers drivers
for non-x86 archs with an additional call to access space that they've never had
a problem with.
As more PCI express drivers start to take advantage of AER and other advanced
express capabilities, the extra call to address a condition specific to legacy
x86 hardware is, IMNSHO, a kludge.
The patches submitted by the others fix the problems with MMCONFIG without
encumbering the drivers to be aware of any difference between legacy config
space and extended config space.
I have tested these patches on a number of systems exhibiting various MMCONFIG-
related pathologies, and they work.
