Great.

I was trying to reuse as much code as possible.

Sounds good.

Probably can't rely on just the user setting. Setting priority to 0 is 
explicit and overrides any swappiness setting which is a tunable. Priority 
will recover by itself unlike swappiness which needs to be set and reset.

I tried that and it didn't shrink enough, but then that's because of the 
SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX limit you mentioned above. But slab can be massive if you do 
for example a lot of 'find's and shrinking slab doesn't affect the user 
experence as much as shrinking the active/inactive lists.

By all means :)
