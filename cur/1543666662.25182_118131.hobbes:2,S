OK, looks bad for me.
Just for my interest:
Why does a certain IDE controller not support LBA48?
I always thought an IDE controller isn't more than some ISA-styled bus 
with 3 address lines, 2 chip  selects and special stuff for 
DMA-transfers, together with very special timing generators for PIO-modes.
Whats the problem with these controllers? LBA48, i thought, isn't more 
than writing the LBA-registers twice (because of the FIFO), and using 
different commands for reading/writing (the _EXT functions).
