checkpatch allows to indent with any number of tabs and up to 7 spaces.
This is consistent with Documentation/CodingStyle and therefore can be
considered "correct".  However, forcing everybody to the same tab expansion
setup is too limiting, especially when working in several environments
at the same time where some of them may not be the linux kernel.
Using only spaces as DervishD suggested works around that using brute force
by forcing the user to the author's preference which is legitimate but
may not be the most productive way.
I think that my proposal of using tabs as logical indents only (as Xav put it)
and spaces for decorative alignment provides the best of both worlds.
One can expand the tabs to any number of spaces as one likes and then
the trailing spaces will work on any editor setup as long as you use
fixed-width font.  That's not considered "correct" as per checkpatch but
works much better for me.
