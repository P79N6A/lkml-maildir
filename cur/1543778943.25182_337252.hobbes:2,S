Sounds sensible enough..  slab does try to make sure it returns the
most-recently-freed object, so it's probably in cache already.  But in the
situation where we're allocating and using a lot of objects in succession
it might help.

Don't think so.  I was once told that if the cacheline is in local cache
for reading and the CPU decides to write to it, additional work is needed
for the write so the prefetch-for-read didn't buy you anything.
