I don't think that will fly with Joe-user that just wants to upgrade his 
graphics driver.  The other problem case is if the user has two graphics 
cards in his system.  He wants to upgrade the driver for one of them (or 
install a new driver for a new card), but the interface between the 
device-independent (in-kernel) layer and the device-dependent 
(in-kernel) layer has changed.
Unless there is some way to have multiple device-independent modules (on 
a built-in and a module) loaded, the user is stuck in a situation where 
he has to update both drivers, but it may not be obvious that they need 
to do so.
I don't think this situation is likely to happen, but if there is even 
the potential for it to happen, we will get bitten. :(
