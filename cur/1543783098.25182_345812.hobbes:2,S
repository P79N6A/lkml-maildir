That was my initial thought as well, but since he's writing the io side
should look correct. I doubt 8 dd's writing 4k chunks will gobble that
much CPU as to make this much difference.
Holger, we need vmstat 1 info while the dd's are running. A simple
profile would be nice as well, boot with profile=2 and do a readprofile
-r; run tests; readprofile > foo and send the first 50 lines of foo to
this list.
