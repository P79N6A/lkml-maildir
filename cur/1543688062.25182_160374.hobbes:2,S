Yes, you can! Reading the code, if vfsmount.mnt_count > 1 then
umount on that device will fail. Similar function is used
by autofs, i.e. may_umount() in fs/namespace.c. I know the patch
is not beautiful but it work.
Hmm. You seem to advice me to detect the 'eject' button then issue
a umount? I don't know how and I guess it is impossible. But maybe
I'm wrong.

No, it seems impossible to sense the eject request (right?). This
is what I really did with the patched kernel and patched magicdev.
When, for example:-
- user insert CD
- magicdev sense the CD, mount /dev/cdrom -> eject is ok
- user play an mp3 file in the disc
- magicdev found MOUNT_STATUS=BUSY, lock the drive -> eject disabled
- user stop using any file on the disc
- magicdev found MOUNT_STATUS=MOUNTED, unlock the drive -> eject is ok
- user push the eject button, the disc pop out because it's not locked.
- magicdev sense empty drive, umount /dev/cdrom
