Hello,
when starting with the new 2.6.x kernels or the 2.5.x dev-series, i get
some very strange errors when trying to access my rio500 with the
rioutils from 
http://rio500.sf.net
I can format the players internal memory, but when trying to create a
folder or to upload a file, the programm freezes. If i don´t kill it,
the system freezes.
One month ago someone wrote about a problem similar
to this one, but i can tell, that it´s not a bug in the player. With the
2.4.x kernels there is no problem in accessing the rio500. Anyone else
has this Problem?
Regards, Florian Engelhardt
