Well, I, with the administrator hat on, phased out all reiserfs file
systems and replaced them by ext3. This got me rid of silent
corruptions, immature reiserfsprogs and hash collision chain limits.

And that is something that an administrator does not care the least
about. It must simply work, and the tools must simply work. Once I hit
issues like "xfs_check believes / were mounted R/W (not ignoring rootfs)
and refuses the R/O check", "reiserfsck can't fix a R/O file system"
(I believed this one got fixed before 3.6.19) or particularly silent
corruptions that show up later in a routine fsck --check after a kernel
update, the filesystem and its tools appear in a bad light. I've never
had such troubles with ext2fs or ext3fs or FreeBSD's or Solaris's ufs.
I'm not sure what patches Chris added to SUSE's reiserfs, nor do I care
any more. The father declared his child unsupported, and that's the end
of the story for me. There's nothing wrong about focusing on newer code,
but the old code needs to be cared for, too, to fix remaining issues
such as the "can only have N files with the same hash value". (I am well
aware this is exploiting worst-case behavior in a malicious sense but I
simply cannot risk such nonsense on a 270 GB RAID5 if users have shared
work directories.)
