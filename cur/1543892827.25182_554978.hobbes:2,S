Someone else already told me this trick, and the "Full Reset" from the 
Control + middle mouse button menu works with my xterm.
Not a problem if you know about it or if you have time.

My shell is bash...

For tools like ls or vim that have to deal with every kind of charset 
confusion for ages such issues have already been shaken out.
But tools don't expects the kernel to output non-ASCII strings.
It's not only about MODULE_AUTHOR, if you consider it rude to limit 
people's names to ASCII, then don't forget that we have printk's like
    Linux agpgart interface v0.102 (c) Dave Jones
What happens if the maintainer changes and it's now
     Linux agpgart interface v0.103 © Dave Ønes
Does the console handle it correctly during boot?
Can all tools that process the syslog cope with it?
Perhaps the answer is in both cases "yes", but it's a completely 
untested area.
We really must have all bugs shaken out and all users using fixed tools 
_before_ we can start outputting UTF-8 - limiting people's names to 
ASCII in not ideal, but IMHO causing breakages for users is a much 
bigger problem.
