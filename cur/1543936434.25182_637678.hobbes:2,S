Subject: [PATCH] kthread: allow kthread_stop calls to run in parallel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/12/155

Currently, all kthread_stop calls are serialized. If something calls
kthread_stop on a kthread, no other kthread will be able to be
brought down until the first kthread_stop returns. A "rogue" kthread
could therefore prevent other kthreads from ever coming down.
This patch makes it so that kthread_stop calls can be done in parallel.
To do this, it adds a new pointer to the task struct. This works, but
I'd prefer to use an existing pointer that's never used for kthreads
rather than adding a new one. I'm just not sure what pointer would be
a good candidate for this.
This is really an RFC at this point, so comments and suggestions
are appreciated...
