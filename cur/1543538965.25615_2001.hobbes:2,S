People _still_ don't understand.
AL VIRO DID NOT REMOVE THE BKL.
He MOVED it. He moved it into the "release()" function, so that we can
pick them off one-by-one. Some of them were never needed (like the
networking code that actually dropped it on purpose immediately), and some
of them will be trivial to fix up.
But no behaviour was changed. sleep_on() is still valid, because code that
used to have the kernel lock _still_ has the kernel lock. It's just that
they got it themselves, instead of depending on the VFS layer to get it
for them.
