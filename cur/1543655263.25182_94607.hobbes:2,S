Try to set UDMA0 by 
hdparm -X64 /dev/hda
or UDMA 2 by using:
hdparm -X66 /dev/hda
OSB4 should support UDMA 2. If anyting > UDMA2, then IDE warning should
appear in dmesg
CHeck the IDENTIFY information using hdparm -I /dev/hda to determine the
UDMA mode supported or /proc/ide/hda/identify, word# 88

When we read the settings DMA was disabled on hda and hdc. We therefore
assumed the BIOS did that for a reason and followed caution.
What happens if you do
	hdparm -d1 /dev/hda
?
