This is an acknowledged weak point of usb-storage.
A 'log only on error' system might be good... but it's going to be a bit
tricky for two reasons:
1) We have to keep data around longer than currently, so we can log it if
something goes wrong later (so we see how we got to this point).
2) What counts as an error?  We probably only want this to kick in when the
SCSI error-recovery does.  Normal 'failed commands' probably shouldn't
count.
