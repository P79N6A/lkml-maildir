Actually, this one is slightly broken, because of the ';' at the end of the
macro (think of "if(x) local_irq_enable(); else somthing_else()").
What I was suggesting is to make a proper inline function, like
static inline void local_irq_enable(void)
{
	unsigned long unused_flags;
	asm volatile ("sti %0;" : : "d" (unused_flags));
}
That completely avoids all the problems you might hit with macro expansion,
while still compiling to the same code.
