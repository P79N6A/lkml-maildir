Not having the patch gives you another effect - disk arm is
moving from track to track in a furiously tempo...
The time it takes to move is longer than the time it is allowed
to read - this is not effective! That would limit throughput
to half the possible. If less than 511 - 31 pages are thrown
away you probably gain anyway...
One optimization to do would be to stop readahead at file
fragments.
But READA pages are special since they might be read never!
Streaming puts interesting kinds of pressure on VM...
