Hello!
I'd like to know what is the actual meaning of the second number in
/proc/sys/fs/file-nr ?
In Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt I can see:
"The three  values  in file-nr denote the number of allocated file
handles, the number of used file handles, and the maximum number of file
handles."
But I can see that the second number actually is the number of _free_
handles from the allocated handles pool !
Is proc.txt not updated or what ? The same with both 2.2.19 and 2.4.x
