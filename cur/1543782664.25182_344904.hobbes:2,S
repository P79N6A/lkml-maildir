   Would we ever want to favor a frequency shifting timer over anything
else in the system?  If it was noticeable perhaps we'd just need a
callback to re-evaluate the frequency and rescan for the best timer.  If
it happens without notice, a flag that statically assigns it the lowest
priority will due.  Or maybe if the driver factored the frequency
shifting into the drift it would make the timer undesirable without
resorting to flags.  Thanks,
	Alex
