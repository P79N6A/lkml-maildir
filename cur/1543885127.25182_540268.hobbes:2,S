Nah, it also happens with cpufreq_powersave. I just need to check 
through some archives and try booting with governor=powersave so that it 
always stays low. Though, lowering the frequency does not really buy any 
temperature improvement in 60 seconds, so I don't think I will need 
cpufreq anyway (other processors have a noticable jump in core 
temperature between 100%idle and a busy loop).
