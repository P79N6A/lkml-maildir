Right.

So there is varied bunch of people hanging around on "linux-kernel"
who look at various bits and pieces. So there is a bunch of people on
"i4ldeveloper" who look at various bits and pieces. 
From a distance, the i4l -list looks as if it's "the bunch of
developers who write the ISDN code". From the outside (e.g. from the
point-of-view of someone at Microsoft) it looks as if the crowd on
linux-kernel is "the bunch of developers who write the Linux kernel".
What's the difference? A set of people who you think are capable of
peer-reviewing code are not in the loop on the ISDN code. That
includes yourself. You like being in control. It is one of the rights
you earn by starting your own unix-like operating system......
So, the ISDN guys should get their act together, and find a solution
for all this.
