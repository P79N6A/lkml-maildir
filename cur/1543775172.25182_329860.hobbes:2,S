This is why I always use _irqsave. Less error prone.
And locking is a very easy to get 'slightly' wrong, thus
I trade 0.1% of performance for code simplicity.

This is more or less what I meant. Why think about each kmalloc and when you
eventually did get it right: "Aha, we _sometimes_ get called from spinlocked code,
GFP_ATOMIC then" - you still do atomic alloc even if cases when you
were _not_ called from locked code! Thus you needed to think longer and got
code which is worse.
