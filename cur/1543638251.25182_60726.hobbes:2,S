Absolutely. I think "jiffies64" is fine (as long as is it converted to
some "standard" time-measure like microseconds or nanoseconds so that
people don't have to care about internal kernel state) per se.
The only thing that I think makes it less than wonderful is really the
fact that we cannot give an accurate measure for it. We can _say_ that
what we count in microseconds, but it might turn out that instead of the
perfect 1000000 ticks a second ther would really be 983671 ticks.
A 2% error may not be a big problem for most people, of course. But it
might be a huge problem for others. Those people would have to do their
own re-calibration..
