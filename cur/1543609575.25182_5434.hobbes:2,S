I was just trying out 2.4.15-pre4 and noticed that I am
completely unable to create partitions on my magneto optical
drives (2048 byte hardware sectors).  Using fdisk to (try to)
create a single partition uttery fails.  dmesg shows:
    ll_rw_block: device 08:10: only 2048-char blocks implemented (1024)
    sd.c:Bad block number requested I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 0
    SCSI device sdb: 310352 2048-byte hdwr sectors (636 MB)
    sdb: Write Protect is off
     sdb: unknown partition table
    SCSI device sdb: 310352 2048-byte hdwr sectors (636 MB)
    sdb: Write Protect is off
     sdb: unknown partition table
With 2.4.13-ac5 doing the exact same thing works fine with the
following showing up when running dmesg:
    ll_rw_block: device 08:10: only 2048-char blocks implemented (1024)
    SCSI device sdb: 310352 2048-byte hdwr sectors (636 MB)
    sdb: Write Protect is off
     sdb: sdb1
    SCSI device sdb: 310352 2048-byte hdwr sectors (636 MB)
    sdb: Write Protect is off
     sdb: sdb1
