The core VM can do that but the hugetlb architectural code can't fall
back to smaller page sizes. It also should not be put into a situation
where it needs to do so given the semantics it must honor.

Fine, s/real superpages/superpages/ -- I'm not picky enough.
Also, the final assertion is inaccurate. Fault handlers must instantiate
pages of order mapping->order when faulting in a page of a file with
a given pagecache size. The semantics of faulting and mmap()'ing are
slightly underspecified but no requirements for the size of the newly
established translations are included, so they can be PAGE_SIZE easily
enough.
