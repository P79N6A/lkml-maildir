at least your interrupts look sane. I see you are using MSI, but no interrupts arrive at 
neither OS nor driver.

that won't work. You either need to start with 2.6.20-rc5 (and pull the changes pending 
merge in netdev-2.6 from Jeff Garzik), or start with 2.6.20-rc4-mm1 and manually apply 
that patch I sent out on monday. A different combination of either of these two will not 
work, as they are completely different drivers.
can you include `ethtool ethX` output of the link down message and `ethtool -d ethX` as 
well? I'll need to dig up an 82572 and see what's up with that, I've not seen that 
problem before.
More importantly, I suspect that *again* the issue is caused by interrupts not arriving 
or getting lost. Can you try running with MSI disabled in your kernel config?
FYI the driver gives an interrupt to signal to the driver that link is up. no interrupt 
== no link detected. So that explains the symptom.
