             That's a bad habbit - makes it impossible to send a
proper reply back to all the recipients. LKML is a public list, please
use To: and CC: so it's possible to reply to the proper people, and
don't trim the CC: list please.

You are right. A sacrificial box or at least proper backups of any
important stuff is important. I didn't write that since I figured it
to be obvious, but I guess I should have spelled it out anyway. Thank
you for making that bit clear :-)
