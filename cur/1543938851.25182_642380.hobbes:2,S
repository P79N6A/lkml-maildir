Ingo, Jordan,
I have written the two minor patches we were talking about in previous
mail. The first one fixes the input clock from 32000 to 32768 Hz, and
the second one adds an "mfgptfix" boot parameter to enable the workaround
in order to fix a regression on motherboards with a broken BIOS on which
2.6.24-rc8 does not boot anymore whether mfgpt timers are enabled or not.
Jordan, if you think you'll push your changes for 2.6.24, feel free to
merge this patch with your work.
Both patches will be sent as a reply to this mail.
Regards,
Willy
