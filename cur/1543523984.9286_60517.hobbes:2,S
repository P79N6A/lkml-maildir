On this similar thread.....anyone know how well the Linksys 10/100
Etherfast cards do?  Its the standard Tulip driver...just curious.  I
have used Linksys for a while and am wondering if they are really just
crap on a board....I never have seen any problems, but I don't sniff my
network...not many errors or collisions, though....
Of course, I don't trust any card that's less then $50, but....Linksys
seems pretty stable and comes with a lifetime warranty....
Any info would be appreciated!!!
