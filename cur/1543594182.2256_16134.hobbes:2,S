Please, I have a lot of 486 that I use for many secondary things and a
386, why I should not be able to run the latest kernel on them?
In princip, linux have to support all old hardware out there.

Again, a lot of modern MB comes out with at less one isa slot, and anyway
isa bus is present also without the slot on all MB since it has to be
there. how many users are happy
with their old sound blaster 16 on ISA, or with their old
isa modem and would never change it? they should never be forced.
