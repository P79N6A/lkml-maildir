Why not? I think solution should be other way around: we limit
capabilities to those found in inode, but never set capabilities. That
way, FS_DAC_OVERRIDE-setcap-program will be setuid root, but will have
info in inode that it only really needs FS_DAC_OVERRIDE. This is how
elfcap works, and I think that's good.

If you use capabilities as I did in elfcap, you'll see setuid
bits.
