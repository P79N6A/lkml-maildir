Would it be possible to have Kconfig select which LSM should handle each
area of security? Selecting LSM A would automatically disable LSM B and
C since they both implement the same security functions, while LSM D
would still be selectable since it implements something else. The default
capabilities code would then turn off parts of itself that another LSM
is handling.
Alternatively the M in LSM can be restored and modules can be stacked.
It should be possible for the primary LSM to check the security_ops of the
secondary LSM(s) and complain if it considers there to be an incompatiblity.
