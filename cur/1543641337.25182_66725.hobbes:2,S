Hello,
  trying to follow this thread. I am an absolute beginner. I bought a
laptop clone, PIV 2.4GHz and installed 7.3RH. The sound does not work and
I have the impression that this is because the sound system and the modem
share an IRQ (9?), which I have the impression is not supported by Linux,
while it works with windows. From the message below you can see that I was
suggested to write to the linux kernel list which I am doing now. The
chipset is VIA VT8233. I installed the OSS sound system, and it works
erratically. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. Fed

I'm afraid the problem is in the PCI subsystem and I have no other
workaround if pci=biosirq does not help.  The yenta driver relies on
the PCI subsystem to find the interrupt assignment for the cardbus
bridge device, and doesn't work properly if the interrupt can't be
determined.
You can try reporting the bug to the PCI subsystem maintainer or to
the linux-kernel mailing list.  I don't know enough about PCI to try
to track it down.
