To do it properly, it should be done within the NUMA framework.  That
would allow generic slab cache optimizations, etc.  We'd really need a
multi-level NUMA framework for this though.
But patch looks fine.

Me too.
My main argument with Ingo's patch (last I looked) was technical: the
code becomes clearer if the structures are explicitly split into the
"per-runqueue stuff" and the "per-cpu stuff" (containing a my_runqueue
pointer).
I'd be very interested in your patch though, Nick.
