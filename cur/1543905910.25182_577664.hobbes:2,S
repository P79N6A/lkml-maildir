That's this config option (read all of it):
config PM_TRACE
	bool "Suspend/resume event tracing"
	depends on PM_DEBUG && X86 && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	---help---
	This enables some cheesy code to save the last PM event point in the
	RTC across reboots, so that you can debug a machine that just hangs
	during suspend (or more commonly, during resume).
	To use this debugging feature you should attempt to suspend the machine,
	then reboot it, then run
		dmesg -s 1000000 | grep 'hash matches'
	CAUTION: this option will cause your machine's real-time clock to be
	set to an invalid time after a resume.
