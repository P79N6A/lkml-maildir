I have been asking the same question for some weeks, mkinitrd doesn't seem
to create a proper file (at least the RH 8.0) and building by hand doesn't
load the driver for the root f/s. I asked for doc on what's needed for 2.5
initrd (my hand build 2.4 works) without answers. I assume everyone is
just too busy to respond.
