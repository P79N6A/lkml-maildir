I don't believe that is necessary.

"other Open Source operating system kernel" does allow this.
Remember, the point here is that this is code that does not run on the
same processor that Linux runs on.  It is a blob that we copy down to
the other processor on the device.

Again, I am not saying that at all, never did.  My position stands until
either Linus changes his mind about the issue, or a lawyer that I trust
tells me otherwise.  As you are neither, I accept the fact that we will
disagree on this.
