Yeah, about right.  Because kernel can't skip FLUSH CACHE and FLUSH
CACHE can spin up the disk back again.  Oh well, some disks even spin
back up on STANDBYNOW to spin down again.  The big fat warning and all
compat mess are to avoid introducing regression and urge shutdown(8)
update such that it does nothing.
