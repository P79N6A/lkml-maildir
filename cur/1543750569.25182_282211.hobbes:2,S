Man, I know the feeling. It's rather annoying that the message does not
tell what is happening, not even the errno. I was thinking about having
the attached patch submitted, but I don't know if it's worth it.
In case of FC3, the most common problem is that udev somehow fails to start.
I do not know what the precise mechanics of it, because /dev/console
exists in initrd images, but with all the crazy root pivoting it's
no wonder it's ineffective. Anyhow, if udev quits, open in the init/main.c
will fail with ENOENT.
The only solution I know is to do everything over again, and make sure
you copied right configuration from /boot/config-2.6.9-1.678_FC3, and that
your mkinitrd run created a sensible initrd image. Verify that udev runs
and if not, debug that.
