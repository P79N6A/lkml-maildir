so right now the results dont seem to be too bad to me - the higher 
overhead comes from two threads running on two different cores and 
incurring the overhead of cross-core communications. In a true 
spread-out workloads that synchronize occasionally you'd get the same 
kind of overhead so in fact this behavior is more informative of the 
real overhead i guess. In 2.6.21 the two threads would stick on the same 
core and produce artificially low latency - which would only be true in 
a real spread-out workload if all tasks ran on the same core. (which is 
hardly the thing you want on openmp)
In any case, if i misinterpreted your numbers or if you just disagree, 
or if have a workload/test that shows worse performance that it 
could/should, let me know.
