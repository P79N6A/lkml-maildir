Yes, earlier one lost a job once in a great while, these days it is
once in a while - the frequency has gone up.
But let me stress that I also consider the earlier situation
unacceptable. It is really bad to lose a few weeks of computation.
You talk about "when it is oom", as if it would be unavoidable,
an act of nature. But it can be avoided, and should be avoided,
unless the sysadmin explicitly says that oom is OK for him.
(Compare allowing oom with overclocking - there is a trade-off
between speed and reliability. It must be possible to choose
for reliability. Indeed, reliability must be the default.)
