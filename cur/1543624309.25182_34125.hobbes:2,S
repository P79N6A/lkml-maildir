Linus, this discussion hung on long enough I decided to start reading it.
So I may have missed something. However, I notice you speak of a networking
example. I believe it is a strawman. The real comparison is closer to that
between IDE and SCSI. Do the SCSI device drivers filter? What and how do
they filter if they do at all? Aren't they a better model to adopt for
a system consistent interface philosophy?
