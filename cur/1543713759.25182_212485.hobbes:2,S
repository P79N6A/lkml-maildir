Hi,
Was anything in your logs about that?
I think that maybe you should disable PREEMPTION.
Or use different distribution than RH9. They often modify gcc and other 
programs, maybe even X - maybe try to compile your kernel on "vanilla" gcc 
3.3.3. I can give you a shell on computer with Gentoo and working gcc. Or 
change distribution: Gentoo works ok for me and my friends! :-)
