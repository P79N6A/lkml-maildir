IDE is similar to SCSI now in this respect.
Are you claiming that SCSI needs fixing too?

Somehow you seem to forget that I took maintaince over
2.5.5x (or 2.5.6x) and there was a lot new stuff added when
you were away (i.e. driver-model and IDE code needs to conform
with it to get sane power management and sysfs support)
and that a lot of other things have changed (influencing IDE).
Feel free to fork so you'll be wasting yours time only and not mine.
