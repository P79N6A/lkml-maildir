I have found that swap prefetch helped on all of the four machines
machine I have, although the effect is more noticeable on machines
with slower disks. They all have one hard disk, and root and swap were
always on the same disk. I have no idea how to determine how many disk
spindles they have, but since the drives are mainly low-end consumer
models sold with low-end sub $500 PCs...
