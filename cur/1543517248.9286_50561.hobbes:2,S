Unfortunately, that means that there's no way it can even begin to scale
on SMP - all "readers" need exclusive locks unless you can somehow
guarantee that there'll only ever be one reader/writer. In some instances,
it might make sense to have completely unlocked per-processor trees
mapping onto shared structures, but it seems a little painful.
