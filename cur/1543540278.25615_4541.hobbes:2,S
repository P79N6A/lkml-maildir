Hi,
I have a question,
is there any way to make all kernel messages go not to a serial console
or virtual terminal but over the network.
Like a pass some console= parameter to kernel at boot time and all
messages
go over tcp/udp to a central syslog daemon running on a server.
I mean I want to capture all messages that come before  
execve("/sbin/init",argv_init,envp_init);
over the network.
Thanks a lot,
Art.
