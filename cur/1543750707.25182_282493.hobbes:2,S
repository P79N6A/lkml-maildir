My 2 cents (not that anybody asked for it or I have any currency here 
since it's rare I get answers to my posts anyway....)
1.  The distributors, such as Redhat, Mandrake, etc. ought to be 
actively involved in stabilizing the kernel especially if they offer 
kernel support services.  (This isn't meant to imply that they aren't 
currently doing so.  After all, they employ a number of people who work 
on the kernel.)
2.  There is nothing to prevent the distributors from pooling their 
resources and funding a small group of developers to maintain a "stable" 
branch as their fulltime job.
3.  If progress is to be made in the development model for Linux, then 
people need to be less reactionary.  In other words, don't criticize 
changes in the development model unless you have a suggestion for 
progressing the model.
