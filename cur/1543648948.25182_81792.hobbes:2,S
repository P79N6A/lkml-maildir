I disagree with your statement that his rants are off topic.  Unless you 
believe that the purpose of Linux isn't the advancement of Free software, 
then debating the merits of using non-Free software in the development 
process of a major cornerstone of the Free software movement is 
fundamentally on topic.  
It's really the pointless flames (things like disregarding someone's 
argument because their consistent and vigilent in what they believe) that 
are off topic.  
This email, is also off topic for the lkml, which is why I'm not posting 
to everyone on the list.
