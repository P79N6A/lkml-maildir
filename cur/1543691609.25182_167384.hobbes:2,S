I don't know what the assembler messages are, but I often do this:
make -j4 bzImage modules > buildk.out 2>&1
bldlogstrip buildk.out > buildkk.out
where 'bldlogstrip' is:
#! /bin/sh
# strip lines that contain CC, LD, "standard input", "In function"
egrep -v "CC|LD" $1 | grep -v "standard input" | grep -v "In function"
to get down to messages to focus on.
