I recently installed Linux on an SMP Pentium-133 machine which has
PS/2 style mouse and keyboard ports.  Everytime since and including
the first time I booted a Linux kernel, the output has included the
two lines:
Jan 2 11:10:54 krypton kernel: keyboard: Too many NACKs -- noisy kbd cable?
Jan 2 11:10:54 krypton kernel: keyboard: Too many NACKs -- noisy kbd cable?
Sometimes when the boot finishes, the keyboard works, other times
it doesn't.  Always, even when it works initially, eventually (after
a couple of days or so) it doesn't work at all.  I can still telnet
in (thankfully) and do things, but a look at the logs will show
Jan 6 18:21:14 krypton kernel: keyboard: Too many NACKs -- noisy kbd cable?
Jan 6 18:21:12 krypton kernel: (last message repeated xx times)
So clearly there is something wrong.  I have tried a couple of different
keyboards, but unfortunately, these don't even work at all--the BIOS
generates a "keyboard error" after counting the RAM.  So somewhere,
there is a keyboard glitch.  I'm hating the prospect that it's a part
of the keyboard controller/aparatus on the motherboard.  Another interesting
datapoint is that all the keyboards I have tried are AT keyboards with
a PS/2-AT adapter--I doubt a problem since I have used this combo
many times, but a consistent artifact nonetheless.
So what are my choices of things that cause this?  I did look at the 
keyboard code where this message originates, and it simply looks like
a fancy way of saying "keyboard not responding".  But why?  Is there
really a chance of a noisy keyboard cable?
Please advise,
Brendan Miller
