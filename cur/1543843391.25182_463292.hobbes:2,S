This is an implementation issue. You can easily have it so that at
the site of a marker you generate some code in a special "trace"
section of the binary which does the actual tracing and insert
noops at the marker site. Therefore the only penalty until the
tracing is enabled is the execution of additional noops.
[ note: this comes from a suggestion made by Hiramatsu-san at
this year's OLS. ]

Instrumentation of function boundaries is usually not much of an issue.
Instrumentation of key events, though, is different. Here's the classic:
@@ -1709,6 +1712,7 @@ switch_tasks:
   		++*switch_count;
   		prepare_arch_switch(rq, next);
+		TRACE_SCHEDCHANGE(prev, next);
   		prev = context_switch(rq, prev, next);
   		barrier();
This is the kind of thing for which the instrumentation, be it static
or dynamic, requires some kind of intelligent analysis of where to
get the info. Now, answer honestly, wouldn't it be simpler to have
such an event marker instead of having to figure out for every kernel
binary you get where the darned probe needs to be inserted?
