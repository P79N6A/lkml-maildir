The main reason we wait until pci_enable_device() to allocate an
IRQ number is that ia64 currently only has about 180 device vectors,
and there are machines with more PCI slots than that.
I also think it's nice that we don't do anything with a device until
we have a driver to claim it.  But there certainly have been cases
where delaying IRQ allocation has caused troubles.
I really like the idea of moving to the IRQ == GSI model for ia64.
But of course, we'll have to get rid of the 180-vector limit to
make that work, too.
