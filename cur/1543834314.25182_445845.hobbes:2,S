As a long term fix, I'll consider getting involved with that.. However, I'd 
like to have something that works with my current setup, hence the.. 
temporary driver... Ok, I'm still going to use it as it solves one bad and 
one annoying thing I have with my Wacom tablet, but I'll keep it outside the 
kernel while better ways to solve this are made.

Creating userspace device drivers is something new for me. If you have some 
pointers to information about it I would be grateful (I've found the FUSD 
framework through google). From what I can read from the doc of FUSD, I'll 
have to open the inputX device if I want events from the tablet to propagate, 
and I'm afraid I might hit the oops in evdev I described in my previous 
thread if I do that.
So.. Are the locking issues in evdev something that is about to be fixed soon 
or should I contribute? Or do you think the issue will be completely 
irrelevant for a user-space driver?
Thanks
 Magnus
