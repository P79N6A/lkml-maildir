This problem is not new. 2.3.42 and 2.3.43 have it too.

It's a typical SMP problem, supposedly caused by bugs in
the TLB flush code.

I've narrowed it down a little bit.
$ for i in `seq 50` ; do md5sum <file_bigger_than_ram> ; done
Over NFS this works, gives the same (correct) md5 sum every time.
Now I copy this file to my ext2 /tmp partition and try again.
About one in five md5sums is incorrect ... but the file _write_
has always been correct.
2.3.37 is the last kernel I tried where the error didn't show
up, so I suspect it changed somewhere between 2.3.37 and 2.3.42.

Rik
