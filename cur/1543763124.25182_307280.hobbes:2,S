Hi,
I'm running into an IRQ problem while removing USB adapters (e.g., when
pulling a PCMCIA card with an OHCI on it).
Specifically, this call chain
  usb_hcd_pci_remove -> hcd_buffer_destroy -> dma_pool_destroy
    -> pool_free_page -> free_hot_cold_page -> IRQ -> usb_hcd_irq
results in a crash. That's not the immediate problem, though.
The problem is that wrapping usb_hcd_pci_remove() in a local_irq_save/
/restore *still* allows that interrupt to happen. I suspect that something
in that call chain sometimes calls the scheduler ..?
I assume that there are nice tools which find that call for me, and save
me from plowing through a lot of kernel code ..? I've never needed one of
those before. :-/
