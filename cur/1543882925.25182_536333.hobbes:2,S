In fact, a certain small set of SMART indicators were a very good sign
that a drive would fail.

Indeed, SMART registered no counts at all for most failures, so on the
whole, it can't be said that SMART can predict failures.
So: not a good idea to base your backup scheme on SMART warnings, but
not entirely useless.
