Hmm... 
                case LCP_STATE_OPENED:
#if 0
                        /* Remote magic changed -- close session. */
                        sp->lcp.state = LCP_STATE_CLOSED;
                        sp->ipcp.state = IPCP_STATE_CLOSED;
                        /* Initiate renegotiation. */
                        sppp_lcp_open (sp);
                        /* An ACK has already been sent. */
                        sp->lcp.state = LCP_STATE_ACK_SENT;
#endif
			break;
Any idea why this is #if 0 ? This should do exactly what you need.
