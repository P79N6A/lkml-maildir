And also, if you download the SCI drivers in my area, and order
some SCI adapters from Dolphin in Albquerque, NM, you can set up 
a ccNUMA system with standard PCs.  Dolphin has 66Mhz versions (and
a 133Mhz coming in the future) that run at almost a gigabyte per 
second node-2-node over a parallel fabric.  The cross-sectional
SCI fabric bandwidth scales at (O)(2N) as you add nodes.  
If you want to play around with ccNUMA with Standard PCs, these 
cards are relatively inepxensive, and allow you to setup some 
powerful cc/SMP systems with explicit coherence.  The full 
ccNUMA boxes from DG are expensive, however.  That way, instead
of everyone talking about it, you guys could get some cool 
hardware and experiment with some of your rather forward 
looking and interesting ideas.
