SS:0 points to 0x00000000 linear address. IOW: SSdescr.base == 0

On task switch it is unnnecessary if SS does not really change (which
is happening 99.9% of the time). At user->kernel mode, yes, CPU
loads SS from TSS.ss field.

There is no "TSS of the selected process". There is only one TSS per CPU.
(Intel didn't plan for this arrangement, but Linux nevertheless uses it).
Because of this, scheduler does not "change the TSS descriptor for
that CPU on which the process is going to be scheduled". It simply patches
some values in current CPU's TSS segment. This is way faster that executing
microcoded TSS change.
