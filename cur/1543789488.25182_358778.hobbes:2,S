If class devices and devices belong in the same tree, then clearly the original
distinction is artificial.  "struct bus_type" is a class of "struct device".
"struct class" is a class of "struct class_dev".  We now know of devices
in between these two extremes (e.g. pci express port driver).  It's also
possible that drivers will want to bind to class devices (e.g. a partition
driver binding to a block device).  Isn't it fair to say that the "bus_type"
vs. "class" distinction is also artificial?  At the very least they are
duplicating some code.

(all in same tree)
pci0000:00.00 <- physical device
|
\- e1000:0 <- driver
 |
 \- eth0 <- class device
 
We already informally have driver instances.  They're pointed to in
"driver_data".

Not at all.  Rather, everything that's currently a platform device goes to
where it actually belongs in the device tree.  ACPI (and other firmware)
enumerates all of these devices.  They're generally children of LPCs and
ISA bridges.  Making a special exception for these devices is ugly when we
can easily represent them like every other device.  This will even be possible
without ACPI for many of these devices if we create an "ISA" bus driver
abstraction.
The main point here is that "platform" is really a hack to represent primitive
physical devices that don't fit well into the driver model.  There may be
better ways of approaching this problem.

As stated above, the keyboard actually does have a real location to hang off of.
Nonetheless, a keyboard controller is a physical device.  It's very different
from a "virtual device" like a tty.  Therefore, it seems unreasonable to make
virtual devices belong to the "platform" bus.
If a device doesn't have a parent device, it belongs at the root of the tree.
That's the only obvious way to represent such a lack of dependency.  This
applies to both class and physical devices.
