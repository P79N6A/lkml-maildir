The point is that those issues are pending for a long time, and they
should be solved, especially the module removal issue (*)
If you are so afraid about applying those changes, maybe the better is
to apply those patches at v4l-dvb tree and at -mm, asking people to
test.
We may hold their commit on kernel mainstream until the next kernel
release, if nobody complains about, or otherwise revert the changes, if
they proofed to cause troubles at dst and/or dvb-bt8xx.
Also, you (or others) may write another approach keeping the fixes with
an strategy more adequate for dst.
Do you agree with this way?

(*) Currently, dst can be removed only with "rmmod -f", due to a wrong
usage count. With Trent's patches, this were fixed.
