I rewrote a lot of driver code to support persistent device and device ownership. So, I thought it was a right time
to clean up interface as well. API was supposed to be cleaned up before 2.4.0 final.

Yeah :(. Dave warned me about that.  I agree that it's a bad thing. Sorry about that.
I promice that there will be no API changes in 2.4.x.

Which imho is not a good idea.

No. Just because glibc lacks a lot of if_*.h headers and if_tun.h is one of them.
Also it seems that there is no standard where if_*.h should go (include/netinet or in include/net).
On my RH 7.1 box if_ether.h is in netinet (which is imho wrong) and if_ppp.h is in net.
