Subject: [PATCH] Fix attempts to use 16-bit PCMCIA w/o CONFIG_IDE

Using 16-bit PCMCIA drivers on a kernel compiled without CONFIG_IDE
results in very weird errors. This patch makes the errors a little less
strange. I suspect the correct solution may involve having 16-bit
drivers depend on CONFIG_IDE...
