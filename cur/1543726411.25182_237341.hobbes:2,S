Andrew, Linus
Russell King is out vacationing for the next 2 weeks so I can't 
push any ARM updates through him and I have have some trivial 
fixes that I'd like to get upstream into 2.6.8.  If you're OK

<dsaxena@plexity.net> (04/07/16 1.1784.14.4)
   [ARM] Fix _find_next_bit_be prototype to use 'const' qualifier
   
   _find_next_bit_be() does not have a 'const' qualifier for the first 
   argument, so we get the following warning for a very large number
   of files:
   
   In file included from include/linux/sched.h:15,
                    from include/linux/module.h:10,
                    from drivers/mtd/maps/ixp2000.c:24:
   include/linux/cpumask.h: In function `__next_cpu':
   include/linux/cpumask.h:216: warning: passing arg 1 of `_find_next_bit_be' 
   discards qualifiers from pointer target type
