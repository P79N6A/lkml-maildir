Hi Andi,
I am sure you did read the rest of my mail, didn't you? I mean the part 
where I describe that there is an option in the BIOS for that but the 
kernel crashes if I enable it.
If it is still a problem of the BIOS, could you please be more specific 
about what exactly is the problem with the BIOS?
Thanks,
        Sergei
