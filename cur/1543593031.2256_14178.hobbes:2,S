Heh, that's funny.  I must admit I'd never thought of that.
Anyway, the bios gets confused because it's trying to figure out (in a very
simple way) where the keyboard and mouse are.  It's true there's lots of
voodoo in PC BIOSes; keyboard/mouse detection isn't one of them.
(As I recall, I have to have something in the port to get it enabled.  Linux
 doesn't seem to know how to enable it.)
