Why?  In the case below, its one logical error (value out of range).
The register dump tells you more information.  In fact, I don't care
which side of less than 1 or greater than 4 pin actually is.  It's
indicating a bug in the PCI subsystem either way, and the analysis
is the same in either case.

This would make sense of the two conditions were unrelated to each
other.
