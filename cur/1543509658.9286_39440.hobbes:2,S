Let me be the first to congratulate you, Richard, and Jamie for all the
hard work you guys put in the software.

A pointer to the V34 work in progress is in order here:

IMHO your driver should go into the kernel as a sound variant like you
suggest, and then userland can talk to that driver via a generic
soundmodem interface.
