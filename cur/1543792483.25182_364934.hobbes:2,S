Subject: mmap over nfs leads to excessive system load

I seem to have hit the same issue as Fabio Brugnara
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0505.0/1061.html
but although he said the problem went away for him in 2.6.11, I saw the problem
in 2.6.8, and still see it in 2.6.14.
When using a sliding mmap window over a file on nfs, the system time increases
with time, and the throughput drops.
Using the same program on a local file I get about 30MB/s with very little
system time... just a bunch of iowait.
I am using a gigabit connection to a netapp, and initially get 30+MB/s, but
after about 30 seconds, this decays to only about 8MB/s with the system time
close to 80%.
I did a quick Oprofile run, and here is the top of the list:

I'm attaching the config.
Other details:

  nvidia drivers
  broadcom gigabit driver (8.2.18)
