Why not just use __raw_readl/__raw_writel?
That's what they exist for, and they still do any IO accesses correctly, 
which a direct store does not do (it would seriously break on older 
alphas, for example).
Of course, clearly the thing has never worked on things like alphas 
anyway, but the point is that accessing IO memory with direct loads and 
stores really _is_ fundamentally wrong, even if it happens to work on many 
architectures. The keyword is "happens".
