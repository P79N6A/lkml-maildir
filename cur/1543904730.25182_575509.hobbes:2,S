I'll point out that the code that's so hard to remove is the code that 
exposes an API to userspace.
code that's an internal implementation (like a couple of the things being 
discussed) gets removed much faster.

this is true and may be a valid argument (depending on how large and how 
intrusive the proposed patch is)
