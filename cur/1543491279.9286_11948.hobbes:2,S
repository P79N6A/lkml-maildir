Dear People,
Let us not argue or cut each other's throats because of a name of
something which we all love in the same manner. It is so simple:
	Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called
	the children of God.         (Matthew 5:9)
Anyone (in the right mind) ought to credit Richard Stallman (and the
Mighty FSF) for the excellent and immense amount of work they have done
for the cause of freedom in the world of software. GNU is "good stuff" but
Linux is the kernel, they should live in love or at least symbiotic
coexistence.
Remember the Scripture "And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no
need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
Therefore, there
are many members but they are all one body, The Body of Freedom and
Progress, which FSF defends and the Linux Community (headed by Linus) 
makes realistically possible.
But I don't call Linux "GNU/Linux" nor "GNU Linux". Not "GNU Linux" for
the reasons RMS pointed out. Not "GNU/Linux" because it would either sound
identical to "GNU Linux" or as "GNU slash Linux" which sounds a bit silly.
Regards,

PS. Thank you Richard for the wonderful talk you gave in London! Though
one may disagree with some statements (e.g. "Install Linux if you
want a solid stable system, unless you are a kernel hacker, then you can
try our (Hurd) kernel"). I really enjoyed listening to someone who is
clearly very intelligent and fights for the righteous reason.
