WAIT, WAIT, THAT'S... :-)

The *only* in your sentence betrayed you.
If they place the limits such that nobody else can access the sources,
they're in violation of the license.
If they merely refrain from distributing the sources to others, but
still enable the recipients to do so, this is not a violation of the
license.
But then IANAL.
