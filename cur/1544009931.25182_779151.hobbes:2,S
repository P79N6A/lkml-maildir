Hi Guennadi,
Other dmaengine drivers have tasklets that scan the list of completed
descriptors and free the "acked" ones.  This happens in the cleanup
tasklet...
/me looks
...hmm this driver does not have a cleanup routine?  Ideally support
for ioctl(VIDIOC_DQBUF) could be achieved through this mechanism
without needing to increase the size of dma_async_tx_descriptor (which
has cache utilization impacts on other drivers).
