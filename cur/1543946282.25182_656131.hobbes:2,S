I guess so, as nohz=off makes the problem go away.

...which is still very possible with C3, and being wrong for <500msec
is still wrong.

Ok, so whitelist the newer CPUs.

Hmm, and C3 is rather common, right?

While I'm writing this from thinkpad X60:
checking TSC synchronization [CPU#0 -> CPU#1]:
Measured 580063 cycles TSC warp between CPUs, turning off TSC clock.
Marking TSC unstable due to: check_tsc_sync_source failed.

Out of?
I do not see what we are arguing about. TSC was not originally
designed to provide time, and it does not provide time at least on
machines with C3. We are using it by default, which is just wrong.
If it works for some systems, they should be whitelisted.
