With nothing attached, any write to the serial device might go through
a lengthy timeout because of flow control.  I'd consider that a bug
in this case though, and there is usually no console printout
per scsi disk access either.
I would not be surprised if your serial console causes a longer boot time,
as all boot messages have to be transferred over the slow serial link
or in the worst case timed out one message at a time.
But I can't see why it'd make scsi disks slower. The scsi host adapter 
initialization
writes some messages of course, but there should be no more console accesses
during a hdparm test run.
