Yes, I was in X (I have a terminal watching my logs), no I don't use kde.  I
was inserting cd's in my changer, and noticed for each cd I mounted, it went
through the validation again (for the same SCSI ID !).  It did the same
thing on my cd recorder and after cdrecord -load, it caused the validation
and the bus froze.  HDD light never went off (I don't have IDE drives).  Box
is SMP (dual pII 450)
