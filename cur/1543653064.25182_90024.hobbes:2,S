looks sane, the idea is that automatically bugzilla would move things that
didn't had any activity to a state that doesn't appears on the default
searches, this can help with dups as well, only the most recent duplicates
would, over time, appear on the default searches. And the others would
remain in STALE mode forever. STALE for over a year? CLOSED STALE. 8) And
even then it would be in the database...
