This doesn't seem to be related to libata at all. Like your
first trace, you call schedule from a softirq context, which
is always atomic.
The only place where I can imagine this happening is the
local_irq_enable() in there, which can be defined in different
ways.
Are you running with paravirt_ops, CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT
and/or kernel preemption enabled?
