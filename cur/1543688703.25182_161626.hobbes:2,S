I suppose that your disk will be in good state, ok,
A time ago I had the same error (with hdc), and was that had forgotten
to clear the hdc=ide-scsi from of the line append in lilo.
Possibly it is your problem, although it is strange to me with hda.
Please check your command line at boot, and remove the bad apppend line in lilo.conf
