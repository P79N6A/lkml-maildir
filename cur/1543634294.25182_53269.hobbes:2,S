Hi.  I was using kernel 2.5.22 with ppp as a built in rathr than
modules and after about a half hour of being up I got the following:
Jun 18 13:01:30 ccs pppd[431]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Jun 18 13:01:30 ccs pppd[431]: Modem hangup
Jun 18 13:01:30 ccs pppd[431]: Connection terminated.
Jun 18 13:01:30 ccs pppd[431]: Connect time 36.4 minutes.
Jun 18 13:01:30 ccs pppd[431]: Sent 738466 bytes, received 1379064 bytes.
Jun 18 13:01:30 ccs pppd[431]: Couldn't release PPP unit: Invalid argument
Whenever pppd would try to redial and establish a connection I got
the folowing endlessly:
Jun 18 13:02:24 ccs pppd[431]: Serial connection established.
Jun 18 13:02:24 ccs pppd[431]: Couldn't create new ppp unit: Inappropriate ioctl for device
Jun 18 13:02:24 ccs pppd[431]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Any assistance would be appreciated.
