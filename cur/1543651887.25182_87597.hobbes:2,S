-acX use special stack for hardware IRQs, and preempt_count() is
copied only from task -> hwirq, not other way around (because of it
assumes that preempt_count() is same on exit as it was on enter...).
That's probably reason why -acX was working for me almost two weeks,
but as soon as I returned back to non-ac, it died.
