"mem=" kernel parameter limits amount of memory seen by kernel
(more info in Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt)
You can also limit amount of RAM detected by bonnie++ by using -r parameter
but please remember that this will make bonnie++ benchmark combined kernel
I/O buffering + filesystem + hard disk performance instead of just filesystem
+ hard disk performance (as it can happen that some / all data won't ever
hit the disk).
