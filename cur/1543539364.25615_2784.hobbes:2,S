I've still yet to see someone ridiculed for bad english. Even someone who
posts in broken english can get the basic message he wants across...Sure,
it may be misunderstood some times, but I have _never_ seen a post like
Learn English, then post your problem again.
This, I am thankful for. I know some programmers in Germany who speak
horrible english, but _always_ write emails to me in English, even though
they know I can speak and read German. The point is that they are trying,
and that's less than these people are doing. I can't count the number of
free translation websites out there...Why not make use of them?
OK, this is waaaaay off topic.
