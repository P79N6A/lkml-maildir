i get these errors in the kernel log while trying to copy a file from an
iso9660 file system (/dev/sr0) to my intenal hard disk. This is the
second cd/dvd that gives me this error. kernel 2.6.23 works without any
problems, so i think this is not an medium error:
ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 3
ISOFS: changing to secondary root
