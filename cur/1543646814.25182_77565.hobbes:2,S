I don't think that is in the least realistic.
There's _no_ way that the krenel could do physical readahead for more than
a few tens or hundreds of kB - the latency impact would just be too much
to handle, and the VM impact is not likely insignificant either.
So the device readahead is _not_ noticeably smaller than what the kernel
can reasonably do, and it does a better job of it (ie disks can fill track
buffers optimally, depending on where the head hits etc).
