I updated the bug-report with some info I collected from another bug.
Apparently my drive sends additional interrupts that confuses the kernel
and make it hang.
The problem is triggered with newer versions of cdrecord (cdrtools
2.01a33 and newer) where cdrecord changed its driver interface.
So it is only the combination that makes the bug appear.
I hope that with that information it will be possible to fix the kernel
so that it doesn't hang. 
ciao
Christian
