Apparently they do not Alan, the pl2303 in particular is a problem child, 
throwing several lost com errors a day when doing nothing more strenuous than 
talking to my belkin UPS from apcupsd, very small packets there, 20 bytes I 
believe at several second intervals.  I can cut those messages to about 
weekly by using an FDTI adaptor in its place, or I can stop them entirely if 
a pure rs232 connection is used.  Unforch, pure rs232 is going the way of the 
dodo bird, and the adapters in general fail such applications badly.  I want 
to build a new machine, but the first thing I'd have to get after a new video 
card is a serial card.  And there goes a slot I'll need for something else.  
My current home automation via heyu, the ups, and the Garmin GPS all require 
serial ports.
Another linux app, a route navigator program that uses the output of a GPS to 
display where you are, also has errors several times an hour when using a 
pl2303 to connect a low baud rate Garmin 12 with no flow control to it.  I 
just recently used it for a 3000 mile nearly month long trip.
So IMO, neither of the 2 readily available devices for usb-serial use is quite 
ready for mission critical usage.
