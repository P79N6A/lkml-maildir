No, this is not going to work well:
- you at least need to reinitialize the completion before enabling
IRQ, otherwise you will spin in a very tight loop
- if noone would touch the joystick ad7142_clsoe would() block
infinitely because noone would signal the completion and
ad7142_thread() would never stop.
Completion is just not a good abstraction here... Please use work
abstraction and possibly a separate workqueue.

kseriod?

Don't you need to write something over i2c to tell the device to shut
down? As it is now I expect the device to continue raising its IRQ
until kernel decides that it is unhandled and should be ignored.

Ok, so you freeing IRQ here, but it is allocated in ad7142_probe().
What happen if you try to open device after it was closed?

input_unregister_device() should be in ad7142_detach_client? I am not
sure i2c - there seems to be 2 interface styles and you probably need
to use the new one. I am CC-inj Jean on this.
