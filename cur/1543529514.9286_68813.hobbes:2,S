I had to mount shm in order to do some testing, and now I find the
following in my shm dir:
[root@aslak /var]# ls shm/ -la
total 4
drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root            0 Mar 12 15:50 /
drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root            0 Mar 12 15:50 ./
drwxr-xr-x  16 root     root         4096 Mar 12 15:40 ../
What is that / file doing there?  If I try to ls when inside /var/shm I
get ls: : No such file or directory.  This dosn't look like correct
behavior?
I'm mounting shm with:
# mount shm -t shm /var/shm/
Is this right?  I can give my kernel .config if it is needed and other
info!
