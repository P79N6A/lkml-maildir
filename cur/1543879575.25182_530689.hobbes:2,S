I noticed that, yes. It seemed a better idea to me to use a data
structure that has what's needed built-in, but I suppose it's not gospel.

Sorry, "priority" here would be from the POV of the queue data
structure. From the POV of the scheduler it would be resetting the
deadline or whatever the nomenclature cooked up for things is, most
obviously in requeue_task_fair() and task_tick_fair().

The suspicion essentially centers around how long the state of affairs
will hold up because comprehensive re-testing is not noticeably done
upon updates to scheduling code or kernel point releases.

I can only do so much, but I have done work to clean up other testcases
going around. I'm mostly looking at testcases as I go over them or
develop some interest in the subject and rewriting those that already
exist or hammering out new ones as I need them. The main contribution
toward this is that I've sort of made a mental note to stash the results
of the effort somewhere and pass them along to those who do regular
testing on kernels or otherwise import test suites into their collections.

I'd start with identically-behaving CPU-bound tasks here. It's easy
enough to hammer out a testcase that starts up N CPU-bound tasks, runs
them for a few minutes, stops them, collects statistics on their
runtime, and gives us an idea of whether 1/N came out properly. I'll
get around to that at some point.
Where it gets complex is when the behavior patterns vary, e.g. they're
not entirely CPU-bound and their desired in-isolation CPU utilization
varies, or when nice levels vary, or both vary. I went on about
testcases for those in particular in the prior post, though not both
at once. The nice level one in particular needs an up-front goal for
distribution of CPU bandwidth in a mixture of competing tasks with
varying nice levels.
There are different ways to define fairness, but a uniform distribution
of CPU bandwidth across a set of identical competing tasks is a good,
testable definition.

At some point the CKRM and container people should be pinged to see
what (if anything) they need to achieve these sorts of things. It's
not clear to me that the specific cases I cited are considered
relevant to anyone. I presume that if they are, someone will pipe
up with a feature request. It was more a sort of catalogue of different
notions of fairness that could arise than any sort of suggestion.

Given the things going wrong, I'm curious as to whether that works, and
if so, how well. I'll drop that into my list of testcases that should be
arranged for, though I won't guarantee that I'll get to it myself in any
sort of timely fashion.
What this ultimately needs is specifying the semantics of nice levels
so that we can say that a mixture of competing tasks with varying nice
levels should have an ideal distribution of CPU bandwidth to check for.

Where is massive_intr.c, BTW?
