Hi,
The Documentation/changes suggests that this is a problem with ld.so and a
glibc bug. I have got a similar problem with ld.so-1.9.5 (1.9.9 is 
recommended) and the glibc-2.0.7 from the update of  RH5.1 (ldconfig 
cause the bad shutdown for me). I upgrade my ld.so but this change nothing. 
So I take the src of the glibc-2.0.7 from the RH5.2 and compile-install it.
After this no more problem ... 
Hope this help for your situation,
Olivier
