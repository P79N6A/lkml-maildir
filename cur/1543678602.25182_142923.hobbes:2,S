Hi Andrew,
The new ACPI interpreter works much better and seems to mostly solve the
previous problems I had with ACPI on a Dual-Xeon machine with HT, see
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774
The excessive ACPI interrupts have ceased, but I still get exactly
100000 ACPI interrupts during bootup and then no more. Also the ACPI
interrupt seems to hit the e100 driver unexpectedly.
I've put up the dmesg output of 2.5.73 at the following URL:
http://hell.wh8.tu-dresden.de/dmesg-2.5.73.txt
Regards,
-Udo.
