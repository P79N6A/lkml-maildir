googled a bit.
It looks like:
awk '!x[$0]++'
does the trick.
So we can skip the C file (good thing).

With this change building modpost no longer worked so kbuild
does not like the preceeding slashes. It could be fixed but thats
another patch.

I guess modules can be built as modules - but they can never be built-in.
And if someone uses subdir-y to point to a dir with modules
I would anyway cosider that a bug.
