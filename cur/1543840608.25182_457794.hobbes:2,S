Depends how you look at it - there are already ioctls in x86 which are
defined using this format:
#define TIOCGPTN        _IOR('T',0x30, unsigned int) /* Get Pty Number (of pty-mux device) */
#define TIOCSPTLCK      _IOW('T',0x31, int)  /* Lock/unlock Pty */
rather than the legacy way, so maybe someone's already taken the decision
that new ioctls should be using the new format, and this "internal
consistency" has already been broken.
Moreover, these two end up being 0x80045430 and 0x80045431 respectively.
If you break them down into the component parts, they are actually in
the same namespace as all the others in that file, but with the direction
and size properly encoded.
It also means that you will have less chance that the ioctls clash with
something else, like the sound subsystem, eg:
#define TCSETS          0x5402 /* Clashes with SNDCTL_TMR_START sound ioctl */
