I don't think it's the same problem. In that case the controller appears 
to indicate that it didn't even start processing the command. In this 
case it's indicating that the command was sent to the drive and is still 
waiting for it to indicate completion.
It could be a cabling problem, yes. Also, are you sure your power supply 
is able to handle the power draw of that many drives?
