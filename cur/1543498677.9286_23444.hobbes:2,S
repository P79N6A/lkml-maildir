	By 'lilo' I meant /sbin/lilo not the boot loader and the option
LABEL=boot should be added to lilo's config file /etc/lilo.conf so then
/sbin/lilo would translate this option into root=301 (for ex.), a kernel
boot option.
	Thinking again maybe the kernel should understand something like
BOOTLABEL=boot instead of root=301, but I think it's rather ugly (then lilo
would not me modified).
