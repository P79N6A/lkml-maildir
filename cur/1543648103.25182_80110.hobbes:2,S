Subject: 2.4.19 TCP-RST ignored by kernel, keeps sending SYN-ACK (no ECN in kernel config)

I really hope someone else has seen this before.
Summary:
2.4.19 Kernel doesn't close out connection from SYN_RECV state when
properly sequenced TCP-RST is received.  2.4.12-ac3 behaves properly.
Full Description:
I have a load balancer that is doing simple health checks by poking at a
port, lets say 80.  The load balancers sends a SYN to the port.  This puts
the port in the SYN_RECV state.  The Linux server responds with a SYN-ACK.
Next, the load balancer responds with a RST.  When I was running the
2.4.12-ac3 kernel, the socket sitting in SYN_RECV went away, as it should.
With 2.4.19, the socket stays in SYN_RECV, and the kernel keeps sending
SYN-ACK's to the load balancer.  Each time the load balancer receives a
SYN-ACK it send another TCP-RST, which again, causes nothing to happen to
the socket.
