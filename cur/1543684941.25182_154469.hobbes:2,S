Con, an uninterruptible sleep is one which is not be woken by a signal,
an interruptible sleep is one which is. There is no other connotation.
What happens when read/write syscalls are changed to be interruptible?
I'm not saying this will happen... but come to think of it, NFS probably
has interruptible read/write.
In short: make the same policy for an interruptible and an uninterruptible
sleep.
