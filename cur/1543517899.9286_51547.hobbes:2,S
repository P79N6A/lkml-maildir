Try turning the caching off your performance might increase ...
Write cacheing is usually done by your OS, so using cacheing mechanisms of
your controller usually does not help you, and sometimes even makes it
worse. Excess cache on your controller board does help if the memory on
the board is much bigger than that of your CPU.
