I disagree. Sendfile can *always* be emulated using the standard file
'read' method.
For most filesystems, that means just reading directly from the page
cache, and that is precisely what generic_file_sendfile() does. IIRC,
the sendfile() inode op was added so that those few filesystems which
don't support direct reading of the page cache could roll their own.
