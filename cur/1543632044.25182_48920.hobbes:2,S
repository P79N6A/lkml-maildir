Indeed thanks for the reminder. However as far as I'm concerned
I would rather agree that the data currently present in those
black/whitelists is basically useless. Most of the disks
present there are simple plain just obsoleted by a great margin
or have already dyed due to the severe firmware errors they did contain.
And finally this data was basically collected during the fortunately
long bast days where cmd64x chips where prevalent on VLB 486 systems.
It's most propably not accurate for more modenr ATA host chip cells.
