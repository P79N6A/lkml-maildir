I noticed that too. It works on the top level choice(before you get into the 
selections). I was just thinking about suggesting to Roman that we could 
either show the same help all the way down in those multiple choice cases, 
or provide a link back up to the main help. Where it would actually show the 
text, but wouldn't repeat the same text 15 times(once for each choice). That 
functionality could probably come in handy in other cases too. I just don't 
know how hard that would be to implement.
