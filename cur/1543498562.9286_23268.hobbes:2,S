It seems that it shouldn't be that difficult; the date can be
transmitted by patching in a fixed-length string in UTC (only); even
if you play tricks with precomputed checksums the IP checksum
algorithm is order-independent, so you just need to checksum the date
string and add to the precomputed checksum.
