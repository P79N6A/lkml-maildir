So you replaced that with mpc_ioapic and mpc_intsrc uses:
 struct mpc_ioapic {
         unsigned char type;
         unsigned char apicid;
         unsigned char apicver;
         unsigned char flags;
         unsigned int apicaddr;
 };
 struct mpc_intsrc {
         unsigned char type;
         unsigned char irqtype;
         unsigned short irqflag;
         unsigned char srcbus;
         unsigned char srcbusirq;
         unsigned char dstapic;
         unsigned char dstirq;
 };
And removed the mp_config_ioapic and mp_config_intsrc types.
The mp_config_ioapic and mp_config_intsrc types are kernel-internal, while 
mpc_ioapic and mpc_intsrc is an MP Specification type - the lowlevel 
structure of these tables as provided in RAM or ROM by the BIOS.
Here's the potential problems that need to be thought through:
- the biggest potential problem is that apicaddr is 32-bit wide while 
  mp_apicaddr is 64-bit wide, on the 64-bit kernel. Can an apic address be 
  above 4 GB, in an mptable? I dont think it can be.
- another problem could be that dstapic are all 1-byte entities - while in
  the in-kernel version (mp_apicid and mp_dstapic) they are 32 bit. The 
  ACPI code fills in the tables too so maybe there it can be wider than 8 
  bits?
I've Cc:-ed a few more folks.
The cleanup potential is significant: we can get rid of all the type 
mixing that we do (assign_to_mp_irq(), assign_to_mpc_intsrc() can go away, 
etc.) and can standardize the code.
