Well, the thing is with the fix that went into 2.6.30, some error path
will never bit hit, or pretty much.
Without the fix, what can happen is that a syscall incorrectly is
interpreted as returning an error, thus triggering rarely used error
path in Mono. However, that shouldn't lockup the whole machine :-)
So It's still worth investigating what's happening when taking the fix
out, as we may have another bug somewhere lurking.
Cheers,
Ben.
