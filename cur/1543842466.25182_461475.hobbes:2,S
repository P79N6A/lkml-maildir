Looks like the last word on
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2228
 isn't spoken. Maybe the
bug can be fixed in dv1394 itself, or maybe we need to rework the
ieee1394 core's *_remove_host sequence.
Checking the 1394 driver stack's conduct during card hot-ejection is in
my long-term to-do list. Hopefully someone else can look at it sooner.
But I suggest you open a new bugzilla bug so we don't lose track.
I suppose the temporary workaround is to unload dv1394 before card ejection.
Thanks for this and the previous reports,
