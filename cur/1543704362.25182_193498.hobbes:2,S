oh, i thought these options were for SATA only. what i need is the ide-part of 
the controller. is this support by these options, as well? i will try as soon 
as possible. i use a debian-backports kernel which for now always kills the 
system during kernel-image-boot. as i use the board in one of our servers, i 
cannot really fiddle around with it to much. thanks for your info.
