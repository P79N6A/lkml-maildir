Not sure if this belongs in a Samba mailing list, or here, but I'm posting
it here ;)
I just had a nasty run-in with the darker side of smbfs... It seems that
if I'm disconnected prematurely I can not unmount the mounted samba
filesystem, and all processes that try to access it go 'D', and can't be
killed via kill -9...  I'd REALLY like to have those processes gone and
the filesystem unmounted _without_ rebooting if possible...  Any tips
would be appreciated..
