This includes the 4th patch posted on march 3, 2008.
Thanks for posting this series. I've reviewed the code and it looks fine
to me as well (kyle already acked it).
And thanks to Joel Soete (rubisher) for testing. I tried to test the
sba_iommu code on my local box but had issues with the unpatched kernel
(using kyle's parisc-2.6.git tree) that I have yet to resolve (could be
HW problems).
thanks,
grant
