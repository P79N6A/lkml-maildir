Oh. This was discussed so many times that I thought it would not be
necessary anymore. The discussion is attached.

Right.

end_zero_page(page, 0) would do put a zeroed page back on the zeroed list.
But we may have to define a cleaner API for it. Plus this is a hot zero
page. So I would need to add a hot zero hotlist to the existing cold zero
hotlist.
---- Description ----
The most expensive operation in the page fault handler is (apart of SMP
locking overhead) the touching of all cache lines of a page by
zeroing the page. This zeroing means that all cachelines of the faulted
page (on Altix that means all 128 cachelines of 128 byte each) must be
handled and later written back. This patch allows to avoid having to
use all cachelines  if only a part of the cachelines of that page is
needed immediately after the fault. Doing so will only be effective for
sparsely accessed memory which is typical for anonymous memory and pte
maps.
The patch makes prezeroing very effective by also allowing the use
of hardware support for offloading zeroing from the cpu. This avoids
the invalidation of the cpu caches by extensive zeroing operations.
The scrub daemon is invoked when the number of zeroed pages falls below a
lower threshhold (defined by setting /proc/sys/vm/scrub_start) so
that its worth running it. kscrubd then zeroes free pages until the upper
threshold is reached (set by /proc/sys/vm/scrub_stop). The zeroing
is performed on a percentage of pages at each order of freed pages.
kscrubd performs short bursts of zeroing when needed and tries to stay out
off the processor as much as possible. Kscrubd will only run when the load
is less than set in /proc/sys/vm/scrub_load (defaults to 1).
The benefits of prezeroing are reduced to minimal quantities if all
cachelines of a page are touched. Prezeroing can only be effective
if the whole page is not immediately used after the page fault.
