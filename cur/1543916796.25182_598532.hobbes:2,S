Hi Rik,
it was pretty low number (several thousands, or maybe tens of thousands).
In the meanwhile, I've come across your patch [1] ("prevent kswapd from
freeing excessive amounts of lowmem") and applied it locally. I'll see
if it fixes my problem, but at a first glance, it seems that it might
actually slow other things down -- when I switch windows, konqueror's
screen redrawing seems to be pretty slow and I can see it progressing
from top to bottom...
