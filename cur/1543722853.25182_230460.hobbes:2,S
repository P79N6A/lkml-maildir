Yes, this sounds about right. It's the prism54 driver, as Russell identified 
in another reply.

Since the card is a PCMCIA prism3 card in a cardbus adaptor, any interrupt 
sent to yenta will be destined for the eth0 wireless card. It's not really a 
problem, I was just putting the driver under duress because I had the 
firewire controller heavily loaded.
Unfortunately these nForce2 boards crammed full of on-board hardware typically 
assign at least firewire and the AGP slot IRQ 19, and the PCI slot I've got 
the cardbus adaptor in is also sharing this IRQ line. I can't really do 
anything about it, I'm afraid to say.
Thanks for the reply Grzegorz.
