I really like when people do (zone->present_pages != 0) instead.  I
always do a double-take at the !! stuff.  Hard to understand at a
glance.
A good patch otherwise.  I had to go change a bunch of reference to
present_pages to spanned_pages when testing memory hotplug, and this
would make doing that much easier.
