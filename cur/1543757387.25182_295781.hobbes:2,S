Dear, linux-kernel.
Is discussed at
http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/1/message/12508/thread
bug fixed in 2.4.x tree? Cause seems i have downloaded 2.4.29, and it
is not fixed (still my kernel on vpn server crashing almost at start),
i have grepped fast pre and bk patches, but didnt found any fixed
related to tty/pty.
Provided in thread patch from Linus working, but after night i have
checked server, and see load average jumped to 700.
Can anybody help in that? I am not kernel guru to provide a patch, but
seems by search in google it is actual problem for people, who own
poptop vpn servers, it is really causing serious instability for
servers.
