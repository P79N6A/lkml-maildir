Oh, I'll live. If I was going to take it personally and go into a big
sulk, I wouldn't be here.  This is linux-kernel, not the super-friends
club.

I've tried to justify it with benchmarks that came with each release and
code reviews, particularly by Dave Hansen, showed that earlier versions
had significant problems that needed to be ironed out. I don't want to
hurt the normal case, because the fact of the matter is, my desktop
machine (which runs with these patches to see if there are any bugs)
runs the normal case and it will until we get much further because I'm not
configuring my machine for HugeTLB when it boots. If I'm hurting the
normal case, that's more time switching windows to see if the next test
kernel has built yet.
If we can do this and not regress in the standard case, then what is
wrong? I'm still waiting for figures that say this approach is slow and I
can only assume someone is trying considering the length of this thread.
If and when those figures show up, I'll put on the thinking hat and see
where I went wrong because regression performance is wrong. There is a
win-win solution somewhere, how hard could it possibly be :) ?
I'm looking at the zone approach. I want to see if it can work in a nice
fashion, not in a "if the sysadm can see the future and configure
correctly, it'll work just fine" fashion. I'm not confident, but it might
be bias.
