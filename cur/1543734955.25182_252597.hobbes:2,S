Thank you for all your input on this.  Of course i could do many things 
on the board.  The idea of the library is that a programmer would create 
the fpga image file by him/herself and then put it in the library.  The 
kernel driver and the library does the decision if its worth putting on 
the chip or not (that's optional, you could force it on chip).

Yes i think so too, especially since it will be my first kernel module 
(and anxiously waiting the next release of the o'reilly book for 
refference).

System-on-chips have been done before, and could be integrated into the 
kernel like you said.  But RAM becomes a problem.  Since its only a 
student project, we have a limit on the adressing width for the ram 
(32bit addressing becomes 32 wires, that's a lot of wirewraping :)  ).

I agree but i think that goes beyond the scope of the project.  Though i 
will consider it.  Thanks for your input!
