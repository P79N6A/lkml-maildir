We will never beat NetWare on scaling if this is the case, even in 2.4.  
Andre and my first job will be to create an arch port with MANOS that
disables this and restructures the VM.

They are.  segment register reloads will trigger the following:
IDT table atomic fetch to verify  (LOCK#) (if triggered by task gate from INTR)
GDT table atomic fetch to verify  (LOCK#)
LDT table atomic fetch to verify  (LOCK#) (if present)
PDE table atomic fetch to verify  (LOCK#)
The process has to verify that the loaded segment descriptor is valid, and
it will fetch from all these tables to do it, with up to 4 (LOCK#) 
assertions occurring invisibly in the hardware underneath (which will
generate 4 non-cacheable memory references, in addition to wrecking 
havoc on the affected L1/L2 cache lines).  Oink.  It only does this 
when you load one, not when you save one, like pushing it on the 
stack.  Since you look at MANOS code, you'll note that in 
CONTEXT.386, I do and add esp, 3 * 4 instead of poppping the segment
registers off the stack if they are in the kernel address space.  
Linux should do the same, if possible as an optimization.

Yes, I know, this is what I was referrring to.  Received are always ugly,
there's always at least one copy into cache for the write, sometimes
more...
