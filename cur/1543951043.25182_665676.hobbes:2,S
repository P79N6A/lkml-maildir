That is correct.  This is used by key_create_or_update() to check to see
whether there's a key in the current keyring that it can update rather than
adding a new key entirely.  key_create_or_update() mustn't be bound by
KEY_SEARCH permission, and similarly the target key doesn't require KEY_SEARCH
permission either; the control here is whether or not the target key has
KEY_WRITE permission.

The "perm" parameter is superfluous given that nothing else now calls this
function.
