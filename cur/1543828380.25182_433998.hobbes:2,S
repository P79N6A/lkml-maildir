They're autoloaded because they correspond to real hardware. uinput
doesn't.

They can't, since without it they can't even type things.

It's a daemon for letting blind user use their braille device
as output device and keyboard. And for beginners this is
yet-another-difficult-thing-to-remember-to-do-after-installation.

That's what we actually do. The root requirement is not a problem since
the program needs to be able to read the console anyway.
But the root requirement _is_ a problem for other cases. When I want
to use a soft synthesizer (qsynth) for midi applications for instance
(because my soundboard has no synth), I have to modprobe snd-seq-dummy
as root, which is tedious (yes I could have it always auto-loaded),
while I could very well have configured an alias between /dev/snd/seq
and snd-seq-dummy, so that just running qsynth as user would just work.

That's what we ended up to do. In this case, this is fine (since
only one module provides the uinput facility), but in the "seq" case
explained above, this can't work (the qsynth application can't know
whether it should load alsa's dummy device or oss's or...)

I can see at least dummy_hcd, loop, snd-seq-dummy, snd-dummy, dummy (net
driver), dummycon, and uinput. This might put quite a lot of confusion
in user's mind ("Oh? I have a USB host?!").

That's fine for me, but as I said this is considered hacky (the header
of links.conf is "This file does not exist. Please do not ask the debian
maintainer about it. You may use it to do strange and wonderful things,
at your risk.")
