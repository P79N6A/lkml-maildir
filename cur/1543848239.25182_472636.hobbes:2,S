When removing SN2 dependencies from the ioc4 master driver, I overlooked
removing various SN-specific includes in the driver.  These need to be
removed to build on non-SN2 systems.

Note to Andrew: ioc4-enable-build-on-non-sn2-fix.patch in -mm should
be removed once this patch is applied.
This time I confirmed the results build on both SN2 and x86_64.
