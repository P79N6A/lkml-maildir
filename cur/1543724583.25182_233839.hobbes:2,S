My requirement is to get to user space in 500 ms from product
cold start.  It would be very nice to do so in 250 ms, to give
user space init more time.  This requirement is pretty
characteristic of many CE products.

Thanks.  Even if our features aren't mainstream, if we can make them
unintrusive, it's nice to get them integrated.  The help offered here,
to make this as unintrusive and danger-free as possible, is really
appreciated.
As to the number of developers and systems using this, I would wager
that developers at almost every CE company will use this (with developers
in the 100s), and that it will affect (at least) 100s of thousands of
devices (possibly millions, depending on how Linux does in cell phones).
