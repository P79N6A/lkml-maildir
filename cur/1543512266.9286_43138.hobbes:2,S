	#1: If you chmod a file in /dev, devfsd does not save that change
		as I understand it (Unless you change your happy config
		file).
	#2: The way it did at one point (Using a tarball) was slimy to
		say the least.  I don't know if it still uses a tarball,
		some say it does, others that it doesn't.  If it doesn't,
		then what is it doing to save, say, links?
	Either way, it's something that is not a real filesystem trying to
	pretend it is.  The problem of permissions being associated w/
	files was dealt with quite a while ago and has worked for a rather
	long time, why try and invent a new way?
