Surelly I will not maintain the DMI table!
It is already difficult to maintain the database of CPU.
The newer CPUs have name stored directly in CPU and no more
in kernel :-(
(
This is a call for help: how to write a table
CPU - CONFIG_SYMBOL ?
Now I use Vendor/Name/Family/Stepping/, but
maybe with Vendor + flags (CPUID flags) the result
will be more correct?
Other suggestions?
