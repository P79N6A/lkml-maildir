Ok. After having done some more poking, I can't see a way of doing this 
with docbook2man -- there doesn't appear to be any way of emitting 
comments. There strike me as two options here: write a script to convert 
SGML to man pages, or perhaps just insert a single sentence into the 
"About this Document" section which explains where to look for copyright 
information.
Any thoughts?
Cheers,
Mikal
