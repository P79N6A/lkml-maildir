This appears to be fixed as of 2.6.12.1. My final test before 2.612
was running UDP streams with netcat. It appeared to be dropping just
about all outbound packets without throttling the sender and without
reporting any errors. Now all seems to be behaving correctly, 11MBps
in both directions simultaneously.
