if that's the case, then i think the best way to express this would be 
to categorize file objects into two groups: "global" (spread-out) and 
"local". Since filesystem space is already categorized per-project, this 
is also practical for the admin to do.
i.e. mountpoints/directories/files would get a 'locality of reference' 
attribute, and whenever the VFS allocates memory related to those files, 
it will do so based on the attribute. (The attribute is inherited deeper 
in the hierarchy - i.e. setting a 'global' attribute for a mountpoint 
makes all files within that filesystem spread-out.)
this is much cleaner i think, and easy/intuitive to configure. This 
would have performance advantages over your current approach as well: 
e.g. /tmp would always stay "local", in all cpusets - while with your 
current patch they are spread out. Bigger applications (like databases) 
would set this attribute themselves - but sysadmins would do it too, on 
shared boxes.
