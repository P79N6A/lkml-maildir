    From: Riley Williams <rhw@BigFoot.Com>
    From what I've read, I gained the impression that there are in fact
    TWO ways that the partition tables in an extended partition can be
    used, but from Ted's comments above, that appears not to be the case.
    Could I ask somebody to straighten me out on this please, and tell me
    what I've got wrong...
     1. An extended partition starts with its own partition table,
        which, like tha master partition table, has four entries.
Yes. Usually, only one or two are used.
     2. The way MSDOS uses this partition table is to put the limits
        for a partition in the first entry, and then specify the rest
        of that extended partition as being ANOTHER extended partition
        in the fourth entry, with its own partition table at the
        beginning, and to repeat the process until all space is
        allocated. 
Yes. Which two entries varies, but most common is the first two entries.
     3. An alternative way to handle extended partitions, which both
        MSDOS and Win9x recognise, although neither creates, is to
        use multiple entries in the base partition table for up to
        three valid partitions (four if they fill the entire extended
        partition) before allocating another extended partition to
        deal with the rest of them.
Yes. (I assume your `base partition table' here is the first extended
partition table.) Also OS/2 and Linux recognise this. Linux fdisk and
cfdisk will not create this; sfdisk will, if you ask for it.
I would be interested in information about which versions of which systems
have used this alternative way.
