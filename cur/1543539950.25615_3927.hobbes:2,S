The difference is that Riley's collection is not CVS'd, so you can't diff
versions through the web, nor browse the files for each and every version
in the tree.
BTW, you mentioned that the src files are browseable in Riley's archive.
How can you do that?!?! I couldn't find it ... :(
Anyhow, I think both initiatives are noble and very valid. I just found
the CVS'd archive more useful _for me_ . But that's for me anyway ... ;)
Later,
Ivan
