I still think that the fact that it regressed in that PCI patch means that 
there is simply something wrong with the patch. At the very least that 
patch changed behaviour, which was *not* what it was claiming it was 
doing.
I do think it's triggered by the "acpi=noirq" setting: that means that 
ACPI *won't* disable the legacy scan. Now, admittedly that's a really odd 
thing to do, and I think it's really strange how pci_acpi_init() does that
	pcibios_scanned++;
in a place where it is not actually scanning the bus, so I do agree that 
ACPI is doing something really odd here, but the fact is, this code all 
used to work.
Can we please just fix the regression caused by that offending patch?  In 
other words: why did that patch change behaviour AT ALL?
Quite frankly, we're too late in the game to say "this exposed some other 
long-time bug". That *particular* patch needs to be fixed, or reverted. We 
can look at changing ACPI in 2.6.26, not in -rc6.
