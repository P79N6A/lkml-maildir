In my case I can't access a problematic host even from the router

Could be. The internet connection is a 64k ISDN link.

I can't snoop the actual tunnel device, because tcpdump and sniffit
give me an unknown media type error. Here's a tcpdump from the router
box's ethernet device of a HTTP session (using lynx) to
www.doomworld.com:

And the connection locks up. This happens every time. I don't have
access to the Cisco so I can't dump traffic on the remote end of
my tunnel.
