__fput() will be called when there are no more references to 'file',
then it will update the time if the flag is set.  This applies to
regular files as well as devices.
But I've moved the check from __fput to remove_vma() in the next
revision of the patch, which would give slightly nicer semantics, and
be equally conforming.
Thanks,
