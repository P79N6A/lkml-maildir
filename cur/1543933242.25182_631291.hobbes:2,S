Yeah, as you note below - this should be un-inlined.

Hmm, I hadn't thought about that one, but what you say makes sense. If I was
a 3rd party looking at this, I'd be pretty confused as to which i_size
function to use, etc.

The problem is that Ocfs2 can have this happen while a file is open (if a 64
bit node extends it past what the 32 bit node can see while they both have
open file descriptors). Even in Ocfs2 by the way, this is a bit rare - most
of the time folks run nodes of the same architecture. We still allow mixed
arch clusters though.
We could stop the VFS changes at some open checks and leave the rest
internally in Ocfs2 [and GFS2 I'm betting]. Generally though, it seems like
the type of thing that the VFS could help more with.
Jan, what if we just define a helper function which checks that a particular
file access is within the bounds allowed by the file system:
int check_file_access_offsets(struct inode *inode, loff_t pos, size_t count);
Something like that would be potentially better documenting than another
i_size accessor. Also, we could try to just leave it in the higher level
functions (write, read, splice, fault, mkwrite). I'm still not convinced
that we'd need to do anything in readpage/writepage if we just catch the
problem higher up.
Thanks,
