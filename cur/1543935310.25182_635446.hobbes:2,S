That would not be overclocking, rather that the hardware designer would
have determined that on that specific hardware design, all peripherals
are able to run at 12MHz.  
Also note that on some other system the hardware designer might have
decided to have a slower ISA clock, to save power, fulfil some EMI
requirement or whatever.

Sounds like a big regression to have to start using a command line
option, when the current state of affairs is "it just works".
