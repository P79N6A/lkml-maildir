They should, however, be able to do something 'intelligent' when told "Oh
s**t - the box is dying. Parachutes, people!" Even if it is just a matter
of flushing buffers to disk, this would be an improvement on uncontrolled
death (as would happen with a power failure, for example) - which is a
circumstance they must be able to handle safely.

Nothing. In fact, it looks like this is what will happen. Rik's patch will
remain as a "last-gasp" defence against otherwise terminal OOM problems,
with a less drastic "housekeeping" daemon to guard against routine
problems (exploding Netscapes etc.). Now we just need a mug^H^H^Hvolunteer
to write that :-)
