Hi list...
I'm using this little program to find out which blocks are use by a
particular file:
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        int             fd,
                        i,
                        block,
                        blocksize,
                        bcount;
        struct stat     st;
        assert(argv[1] != NULL);
        assert(fd=open(argv[1], O_RDONLY));
        assert(ioctl(fd, FIGETBSZ, &blocksize) == 0);
        assert(!fstat(fd, &st));
        bcount = (st.st_size + blocksize - 1) / blocksize;
        printf("File: %s Size: %d Blocks: %d Blocksize: %d\n", 
                argv[1], st.st_size, bcount, blocksize);
        for(i=0;i < bcount;i++) {
                block=i;
                if (ioctl(fd, FIBMAP, &block)) {
                        printf("FIBMAP ioctl failed - errno: %s\n",
                                        strerror(errno));
                }
                printf("%3d %10d\n", i, block);
        }
        close(fd);
}
This works fine for regular files, but not for directorys. Both ioctl's,
FIGETBSZ and FIBMAP, are implemented for regular files only. 
Is there a patch to make this FIGETBSZ and FIBMAP work on directorys
too?
Or alternativly, is there a way to find out which blocks are used by a
directory?
Thanks for answers in advance
  Sebastian.
