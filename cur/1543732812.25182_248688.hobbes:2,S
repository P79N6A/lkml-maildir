Ok, i booted with a bigger vga console. btw: it seems with APIC and
nmi_watchdog, i actually need to quit my scsynth app to trigger the bug.
so maybe this is a different one than the one i saw befure _during_
scsynth running [and jackd of course].
Since this is lots of text i have again become lazy. It would be much
better if someone could reproduce this behaviour on a machine with
serial console. Or a digital camera would work, too, to make a
screenshot of the Ooops.
Anyways: the screen was divided by a -----cut here: --- line. Above
which i saw this trace:
Badness in __put_task_struct at kernel/fork.c:89

do_syslog
sub_preempt_couint
dnotify_parent
autoreceive_wake_function

autoreceive_wake_funtion
kmsg_read
vfs_read
sys_read
syscall_call
-----cut here:----
then this:

Hope i have got some useful info this time around.  It seems there was
another bug which scrolled off the screen. I used the patched kernel
though.. [i'm pretty sure at least]..
