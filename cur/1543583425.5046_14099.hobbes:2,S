This should be accessible in your BIOS setup.  I'm basing my comments on
one NIC driver complaining in my logs and overriding settings lower that 64;
however the general idea is to trade off latency for throughput.  If I go crazy,
like 192 or so, on *my* system, sound card starts to pop a bit, indicating that
it's fifo buffer is smaller that that and is emptying when other devices
are using the bus at the same time (it's like a timeslice)
