Maybe. On the other hand, marking it dirty is going to be almost as 
expensive as taking the whole page fault again. The dirty bit is in 
software on a lot of architectures, and even on x86 where it's in hw, all 
microarchitectures basically consider it a micro-trap, and some of them 
(*cough*P4*cough*) are really bad at it.
So I'd actually rather just mark it dirty too, because that way there is a 
real potential performance upside to go with the real potential 
performance downside, and we can hope that it all comes out even in the 
end ;)

PS. Yes, I wrote the benchmark. On at least some versions of the P4, just 
setting the dirty bit took 1500 cycles.. No sw-visible traps, just a *lot* 
of cycles to clean out the pipeline entirely, do a micro-trap, and 
continue. Of course, the P4 sucks at these things, but the point is that 
it can be as expensive to do it "in hardware" as doing it in software if 
the hardware is mis-designed..
