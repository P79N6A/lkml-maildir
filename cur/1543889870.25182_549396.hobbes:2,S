Looks like an EDID block not accessible by i2c and only available
through the BIOS. And it's probably broken too.
Can you #define DEBUG in drivers/video/fbmon.c, enable
CONFIG_FIRMWARE_EDID, the post your dmesg?
For now, the best you can do is disable i2c support and add:
video=nvidiafb:1600x1200@60
in your boot line.
