Note that I recommend this for 2.4 _only_. For 2.5 the correct fix is to
fix the tty_driver API, so you can perhaps let this 'bug' remain there
for a while. I seem to be the only person using an rfcomm modem for
dialin anyway, and 2.5 doesn't even get as far as a login prompt on that
box, let alone support V.110 dialin over ISDN which is also required, so
I really won't miss it :)
The write_room() function is documented to return the number of
characters which can _currently_ be pushed to the tty driver. The n_tty
code has no business thinking that the value returned from write_room()
will be valid at _any_ point in the future, and the fact that put_char()
is not permitted to return any success/failure indication like write()
can is just bizarre.
