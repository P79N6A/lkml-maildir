Almost.  It compiles into a usable header but breaks the text() macro
which is used to emit a commit (actually any string literal) into the
output:

With your patch nothing will be emited.  The existing non-MIPS sed
expression in Kbuild doesn't allow for that which is why I added the
handling of @@@-prefixed strings to the sed expression.  And once that
is there the remaining asm-offset.c change is no longer needed.
