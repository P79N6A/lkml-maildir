Correct, but I'm not really sure if it worth worrying about x86
missing this, furthermore it would still be possible to enable it on
the very x86 low end (with regular 4k page size) that may worry to use
up to the last byte of ram as cache for tiny files. To me using
kmalloc for this looks quite ideal.
Thanks.
