I realize that this time next year it won't be possible to use a ramdisk or a 
network block device without going through the SCSI layer, but while it 
remains an option I'm relishing _not_ using it, thanks.

Or (and this is just a thought), you could upgrade your kernel so it correctly 
handles your hardware, treating this just like any other driver bug or other 
lack of proper hardware support in the history of Linux.  (Back when APM 
couldn't power off the machine at the end of the shutdown sequence, did we 
modify shutdown to try to work around this, or did we fix it in the kernel so 
it worked?)
Why does everybody want to shoehorn everything through the SCSI layer, anyway?  
Last I checked you didn't have to spin down a USB flash key.  If SATA is 
SCSI, what the heck is SAS?  (Answer: a cynical marketing hack to bleed SCSI 
bigots for the huge margins they've always been bled for.  But oh well.)  It 
would be hilarious if I didn't have to put up with it renumbering my devices 
and imposing requirements for hardware I haven't got on hardware I have 
got...
