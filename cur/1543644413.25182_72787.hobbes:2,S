And BSD? And Solaris?

No matter how fast you do context switch in and out of kernel and a sched
to see what runs next, it can't be done as fast as it can be avoided.
Being N:M doesn't mean all implementations must be faster, just that doing
it all in user mode CAN be faster.
Benchmarks are nice, I await results from a loaded production threaded
DNS/mail/web/news/database server. Well, I guess production and 2.5 don't
really go together, do they, but maybe some experimental site which could
use 2.5 long enough to get numbers. If you could get a threaded database
to run, that would be a good test of shared resources rather than a bunch
of independent activities doing i/o.
