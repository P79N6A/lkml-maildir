Actually their are hotplug video cards. High end servers have hot swapable 
graphcis cards. Would you want to take down a very important server
because the graphics card went dead. You pull it out and you plug a new
one in. Also their are PCMCIA video cards. I have seen them for the hand
held ipaqs. It is only a matter of time before all devices are hot
swappable.
