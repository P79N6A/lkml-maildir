That didn't work so well.  Looks like yahoo mail is splitting
the patch lines at places that you didn't intend, so the
patch cannot be applied by 'patch':  'patch' says that the
patch is malformed.
You will need to continue to use attachments (yes, we prefer
inline patches instead of attachments) or you will need to
configure yahoo mail so that it doesn't muck up your inline
patches (I don't know if this is possible) or you will need
to use a different (and decent) mail client.  When you are
ready to try again, please send the patch to yourself first
and make sure that the received email patch can be applied
cleanly.
