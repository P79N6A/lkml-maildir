I observe the same problem with Gigabyte 965P-DS4, and there are at
least two causes - 1) MP supported flag in FADT is missing (so
CPU_HOTPLUG would be necessary), and 2) C2 latency is set to 101,
while the maximum allowed in the kernel is 100.
However, from the power consumption and the CPU temperature it seems
that the power saving works anyway, so I'll live with it.
