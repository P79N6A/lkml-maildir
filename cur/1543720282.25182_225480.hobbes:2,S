Huh?  binfmts do work on all linux architectures unchanged.  What you do
on other operating systems is up to you.  And btw, netbsd already has
binfmt_pecoff, you could certainly make use of that, too.

_You_ are relying on undocumented assumptions here.   Windows has different
address space layouts than ELF ABI systems and I think you're much better
off having your own pecoff loader for that.
