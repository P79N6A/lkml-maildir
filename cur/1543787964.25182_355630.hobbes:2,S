Subject: [RFC PATCH] pci_ids: cleanup - remove redundant #defines from source
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings,
Appended is start of next set for pci_ids cleanup.
RFC as the pci_ids cleanup after this patch will involve transferring 
symbols from source to pci_ids.h.  The files in this patch are part of 
a 49 file target list that contain an #ifndef, #define sequence for 
PCI_VENDOR_ID_* and PCI_DEVICE_ID_* symbols.  Remaining targets require 
a transfer of symbols to pci_ids.h, thus will be presented separately 
by areas identified from linux/MAINTAINERS.
Further information (eg. hit list) is on:

Cheers,
Grant.
