Hi Linus,
You seem to have turned:
	+#if THREAD_SIZE >= PAGE_SIZE
		max_threads = mempages / (THREAD_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE) / 8;
	+#else
	+	max_threads = mempages / 8;
	+#endif
	+
Into:
	if (THREAD_SIZE >= PAGE_SIZE)
		max_threads = mempages / (THREAD_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE) / 8;
	else
		max_threads = mempages / 8;
Please don't do that. What you've done causes a divide-by-zero error to be
emitted by the compiler if PAGE_SIZE > THREAD_SIZE. That's why I used the
preprocessor in the first place.
On FRV arch the minimum page size the MMU permits (when there is an MMU) is
16KB; however, that's rather a lot of stack space for the kernel, so I only
allocate half that.
David
