For how many years do you know that there's a new and actively 
maintained e100 driver for your hardware?
And if you don't follow a stable line like the 2.6.16 kernel or a 
distribution kernel it's simply a part of the current development model 
that some kernel parts change. If changing one driver results in a big 
problem in your setup you should reconsider your setup. And every new 
kernel except for -stable kernels will anyway require a revalidation, so 
changing the network driver as part of this shouldn't be a big issue.

And exactly this is the reason why the eepro100 driver has to be 
removed, and that this will result in a better hardware support for 
everyone in the long term.

I don't have a personal preference for the e100 driver (although it's 
working fine in my computer), but I have a preference for the benefits 
of having only one driver for a given hardware over having two drivers.
People like you use the eepro100 driver instead of reporting the bugs in 
the e100 driver you ran into.
This is exactly the problem with two different drivers having different 
hardware support, different features and different bugs we should avoid.
One driver supporting all hardware, having all features and all bug 
fixes is a huge benefit.
In your prevous email you were whining "And for a number of card for old 
buses like ISA, EISA, and VESA, the e100 has not worked." although 
eepro100 didn't support such cards.
Now you claim to speak for "the system administrators".
Please bring some technical points, preferably bug reports for problems 
with e100 that don't exist with eepro100.
