It mean just it. I forced device to enter "suspend" mode.

Device is Compaq iPaq running Linux.
Command line is echo >/proc/sys/pm/suspend (on iPAQ prompt)
This even generates 2 simultaneous irqs: one is for serial (DCD clear)
and one is for USB (device detachment) (which iun turn should call 2
usermode helpers on is for net.hotplug helper (usb0 net device unregistering)
and one is usb.hotplug helper (USB device unregistering))

I use uhci, but I saw no usb symbols in backtrace so I think it does not
matter.
Also I must say that this is 100% repeatable (and backtrace is almost the same,
except for last few items)
