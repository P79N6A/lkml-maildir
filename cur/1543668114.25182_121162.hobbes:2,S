Hi!
Apparently bios failed to initialize ali properly; I tried to force
address manually, but I get:
i2c-ali15x3.o version 2.7.0 (20021208)
ali15x3 smbus 00:06.0: forcing ISA address 0x0200
ali15x3 smbus 00:06.0: force address failed - not supported?
ali15x3 smbus 00:06.0: ALI15X3 not detected, module not inserted.
Any ideas what more to try?
