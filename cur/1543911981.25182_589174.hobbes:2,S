A full solution would require two parameters, i.e. VmUsers/VmMagic.
But please make sure the new lines won't break important tools like
ps/top/pmaps/...
A quick test shows that only ps will parse /proc/<pid>/status:
        strace -e open ps
        strace -e open top
        strace -e open pmap $$
