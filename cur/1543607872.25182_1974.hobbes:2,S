gcc 2.96 and 3.0 _rightfully_ object to calling a function pointer with a
different number of arguments than the function pointer prototype is. Even
if gcc didn't object to it, I consider it butt-ugly and you also just lost
any and all type checking the compiler can help you with. During the change
to calling the real functions instead of the basicaly untyped function
pointers, quite a few ibcs bugs were fixed just because the arguments were
wrong. I'm with Christoph on this 100%.
