There is never any reason to advertise a receive window
larger than the initial congestion window of the sender
could ever be.
Setting it properly like this also makes sure that we do
receive window update events at just the right place as
the sender starts sending us the initial data frames.

Yep, that space>=mss test looks super buggy for the *rcv_wscale
not zero case.
Good thing we don't have this buggy code in 2.6.x any more.
It's only present in 2.4.x
