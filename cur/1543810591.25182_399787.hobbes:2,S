I _really_ hate __devinit.  Almost everyone who uses it gets it wrong
the first time (like pci hotplug drivers using it, which is just
pointless...)  Now that CONFIG_HOTPLUG is always enabled (well, it's a
lot harder to disable it now), hopefully when people get it wrong it
will not cause problems.

That's not a bad idea.

Like I said above, almost everyone uses it incorrectly.  I went through
the whole tree sometime late 2.5 and fixed up everything.  It's probably
time for another audit...
