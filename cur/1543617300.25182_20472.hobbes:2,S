Linus and Alan last year (end Dec 2000), told that it would nice to have
some kind of autoconfiguration.
The problem was the bug report about non running kernel, because of
false configuration (CPU configuration).
How many people try new kernel with the wrong CPU configuration?
(and mornally user know the name of own CPU, with netcards this is
more difficult).
[ We don't reduce trafic on lkml, because the fewer bug reports
are hidden by this huge flamewar]

Root will help, but AFAIK, not needed. Forget DMI.
Out detection is 'hang' free. (so a soft detection, but with some
tests, I can say that with this soft detection we can detect nearly
all, without the difficult to write hard probes).

PCI, USB and ISAPNP detection works well.
ISA is a further step.
I will send Eric the new detections and database for new probes (for ISA
and others) drivers. So I hope also the ISA thread will end.
