These GPRS cards are basically wireless modems which accept a Hayes command
set (AT+????, etc...), can send and receive SMS messages, as well as 
support WAP and PPP internet surfing.
Hayes commands allow for measuring local signal strength (AT+CSQ), reading
and writing SMS messages (AT+CMGF, AT+CMGW, AT+CNMI) etc...
So, it is somewhere between a serial driver and a wireless driver.
