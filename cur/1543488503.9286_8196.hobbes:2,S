I guess we're not understanding each other properly... I meant to ask
whether setting immutable/append_only/no_unlink on a symlink is possible?
as in the current(?) chattr/lsattr follow symlinks... 
# ln -s foo bar
# lsattr bar
lsattr 1.10, 24-Apr-97 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
lsattr: No such file or directory While reading flags on bar
... and no I don't know where those flags are stored; do symlinks even have those flags?
