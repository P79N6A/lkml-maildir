Thanks to everybody for its answers...
My confusion/problem was that I has always tried with only two drives,
and with more or less old drives that gave around 20-25Mb/s each, so
the raid worked very optimally at about 50 Mb/s.
But with modern drives at 55 Mb/s, I hit the PCI speed limits, I suppose.
Board is a Supermicro P3TDDE, Via ApolloPro 266T chipset (aghhh),
33 MHz PCI, 2xPIII@933.
With a stock 2.6.8.1, I get this:
nada:~# hdparm -tT /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   864 MB in  2.00 seconds = 431.63 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  252 MB in  3.01 seconds =  83.85 MB/sec
with this setup:
nada:~# mdadm --detail /dev/md0
