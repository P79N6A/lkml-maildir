I have very very fast network and is testing NFS2 over this kind of
network. I noticed that for standard work like read/write a large
file,  compile kernels, the performance of NFS2 is good. But if I try
to decompress kernel tar file. The standard ext2 takes 28s while NFS2
takes 81s. Also, if I remove the kernel source code tree, ext2 takes
19s but NFS2 takes 44s.
Why?  (You can assume that network is very fast. )  Is there any
improvements in NFS3/4 on this issue? If so, how?
Many thanks in advance for your kind help!
