Well ... can't say I ever got answers to some of my questions.
But the critical one was answered - what patch(es) do I need
to fix this memory corruption problem on SLES10 kernels.
Earlier, Suresh had recommended [numbers added by pj]:

Only two of these three patches are needed for this memory corruption
bug:
  1) sched: fix group power for allnodes_domains
  3) sched: build_sched_domains() fix
Patch (2) addresses a separate problem, and has been reworked since
anyway, and was the one that caused me grief backporting SLES10 as it
depended on other patches not in SLES10.
The key fix for the memory corruption is in patch (1).  This patch went
into Linus's tree on March 28, 2006.  Patch (3) fixed a bug introduced
in the first patch.
