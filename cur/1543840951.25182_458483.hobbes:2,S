With the old protocol, the command line is supposed to fit inside the 
64K segment, so I don't think that's an issue.  Putting "Hail Mary" 
break at 0xfffd isn't a bad idea, though (especially since even if that 
is legitimate, we can't fit "edd=" into that one.)

Agreed.  I'll update the patch shortly.
