In general yes.  Anything that writes into a tmpfs filesystem is liable
to disproportionately decrease the available memory on a particular node.
Since there's no telling what sort of application (e.g. dd/cp/cat) might be
dropping large files there, this lets the admin choose the appropriate
default behavior for their site's situation.
