A machine serving mail, dns, smb, http, and sql as well as
doing routing and using ipfwadm -- working flawlessly.
However, the following message was output to console some 
5 times:
ECC failed (0 CRC errors, >1 CRC failures)
attempt to correct data at 255.
The above message was repeated about 5 times a tthe console
since initial boot 127 days ago:
  1:40pm  up 127 days,  3:02,  2 users,  load average: 0.14, 0.19, 0.08
Other information? :

Not really a big deal, everything still functions as it
should-- just curious what the message means.  
Thanks,
