It seems utterly insane to have aio_complete() flush a workqueue. That
function has to be called from a number of different environments,
including non-sleep tolerant environments.
For instance it means that directIO on NFS will now cause the rpciod
workqueues to call flush_workqueue(aio_wq), thus slowing down all RPC
activity.
