What do you want the address of in your driver? Do you want the
address of its various entry points (hint, the stuff you put
into the "struct file_operations"), or its startup code, module_init(),
exit code, module_exit(), etc.
These are can all be obtained using conventional 'C' syntax. You
don't need to search some list somehere. You driver isn't just
put somewhere en-masse. The code is in the .text segment, relocated
to exist in allocated memory. The data sections are also relocated
to different sections of allocated memory.
You get the address of a function by referencing its name:
static int ioctl(struct inode *inp, struct file *fp, size_t cmd, unsigned long
arg)
{
     unsigned long val;
     switch(cmd)
    {
     case GET_ADDRESS_OF_IOCTL:
         val = (unsigned long) ioctl;
         if(put_user(val, (unsigned long *)arg))
             return -EFAULT
         break;
     case ETC:
    }
Your driver probably has many functions, therefore it has many
addresses. It's not just a single "module" somewhere.
