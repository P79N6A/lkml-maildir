I think rounding to the closest page size is a better option, but
again it can be a bit confusing. I am all for using memparse() to
parse the user input as a specification of the memory limit.
The second question of how to store it internally without truncation/
rounding is something we need to agree upon. We also need to see
how to display the data back to the user.
I chose kilobytes for two reasons
1. Several people recommended it
2. Herbert mentioned that they've moved to that interface and it
   was working fine for them.
