I assure you I have not set my max-mount down to three or four, and since
it crashes several times a day you can forget forced by date, too.
C'mon, I've been doing this stuff since the MCC four floppy distribution
was king, I've seen a max mount counts message before. This is purely a
case of the *first* mount message being EXT2 instead of EXT3, as if the
journal wasn't detected in the first place. However, the r/w mount is
always ext3 per fstab.
I never get close to max-mounts, this problem is in the 20-30% of the time
range. No one knows why a lot of the Dells hang on X-logout, guess this is
one more thing it does poorly.
