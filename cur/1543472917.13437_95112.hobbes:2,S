If you mean that it is the DIRECT method which will be used when both 
methods (BIOS+DIRECT) are available, then I agree 100% with your code.
It seems that on x386, using a DIRECT method is more safe than 
trusting PCI BIOSes.
As an example of that, it seems that some not old AWARD bioses donnot 
detect additionnal functions of PCI multi-function devices, but using 
a DIRECT method is OK. As a result, users that have this crappy PCI 
BIOS are just stuck with PCI multi-function devices under linux-2.0.
