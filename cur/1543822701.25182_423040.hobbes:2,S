Subject: [PATCH 001 of 8] md/bitmap: Fix online removal of file-backed bitmaps
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/12/13

When "mdadm --grow /dev/mdX --bitmap=none" is used to remove
a filebacked bitmap, the bitmap was disconnected from the array,
but the file wasn't closed (until the array was stopped).
The file also wasn't closed if adding the bitmap file failed.
