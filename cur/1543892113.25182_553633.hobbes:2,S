Is this ia64 patch the one you mentioned that you did not post to LKML 
because it was too large in patch 0?  Is there any way you could break 
that patch up itself and post it for comments?

Your formal is "struct task_struct **task" yet the only actual to this 
function is the memory address of a pointer to a single struct task_struct 
(i.e. it's never passed an array of struct task_struct pointers, which 
"struct task_struct **task" is).
And since you only ever use this has *task to get the pointer, you can 
change the formal to just be "struct task_struct *task" and then pass in a 
pointer to a single struct task_struct.

It should be simple if this is broken down into two smaller functions, the 
latter of which is called only upon a successful return of the former.

Stack overflows like that are annoying to track down and powerpc has the 
highest PFM_PMC_STK_ARG of the entire patchset.

I'm looking forward to seeing the next patchset and I'll give it a 
thorough test run on x86_64.  It'd probably be best to base that patchset 
off 2.6.22 when it's released.
