ext2 is upgradable to ext3; after you have created a journal
on the filesystem (either by hand or using tune2fs) you can
remount the filesystem as ext3.   If it turns out you don't
like ext3, you can even go back to ext2 by unmounting the ext3
fs and remounting it ext2.
Going to reiserfs will require a reformat of your partition,
because the format is completely different.

Rik
