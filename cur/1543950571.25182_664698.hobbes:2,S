yeah. I've got a CONFIG_BOOTPARAM patch already, which turns a lot of 
boot parameters into .config options. (this is one of our conceptual 
holes: for many boot parameters there's no matching .config)
another thing is that i think all parameters should have all their forms 
active: so if there's "noacpi", then "acpi=0/1", "acpi=off/on" should 
work as well.
furthermore, usability shortcuts for common combinations would be useful 
too. Like "serialdebug" could be used as a shortcut for 
"earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 console=ttyS0,115200 console=vga debug". 
Things like that would be really cool.
