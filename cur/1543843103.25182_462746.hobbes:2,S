no custom keymaps . init=/bin/bash :d
uhm, i don't get what you mean by this dmesg syntax :o
i should probably attach serial conole and send you whole output,
as now (as keyboard is unuseable) i can't scroll screen.
btw. serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
is found.
also
input: AT Raw Set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input1
is reported
ah, i use gcc-4.1.1 to compile kernel .
-------------------- stuff below might be result of my ignorance
i just checked 2.2.27 kernel. it behaves quite identical to 2.4.33.3,
just after 'freeing unused kernel memory' it touches disk , and just
sits there. kepresses are echoed, and keyboard output is 
ok. i can reboot it by ctrl-alt-delete too .
when i boot it with 'fosh' shell commandline appears, but trying
to use any tool like bash, ls , etc results with signal 11.
tools are statically compiled against glibc-2.4 (compiled for 486 cpu
on gentoo)
busybox works fine.
on 2.4.33.3 kernel Xvesa (from kdrive package) complains
'set_thread_area failed when setting up thread-local storage'
cardmgr works fine aswell...(though was linked against different glibc)
  i guess there is some problem with math emulation and glibc,
as on 2.6.18 everything works just fine.
i recall few years ago i tried to make 386SX work on 2.4.20 , and 
there were problems with math emulation (some apps worked, some not)
