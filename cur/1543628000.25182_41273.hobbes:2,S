Confusing as it may be to non-USB developers, how about using the USB
spec terms "host" (for the PC) and "local host" (for the USB
gadget/client/device/etc...)? I haven't seen those specific terms
suggested yet after quickly searching through the archive.
For shorthand, you might use "h" and "lh" suffixes, i.e., "usbh" for
host code, and "usblh" for local host code. Or something else if that
seems too terse.
One well placed Readme file ought to make the distinction pretty clear
to most end users, and USB developers shouldn't find it a problem at
all.
