I haven't done any of the testing myself.  But, I was told that the 
Adaptec AIC stuff is good.  I think that the LSE patch has been tested 
on with Adaptec (aic7xxx) and QLogic fiber channel controllers.  I guess 
that the QLogic stuff is liked because the drivers are open source.
I was surprised to see that the ServeRAID driver isn't touched by the 
lse patch.  I thought that it still uses the io_request_lock in 2.4.
Care to add anything, Gerrit?
