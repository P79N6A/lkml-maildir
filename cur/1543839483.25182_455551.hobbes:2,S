So if you don't mind, I'm taking this to linux-kernel, please answer to
the list and Cc to me.

include/linux/errno.h says user space should never see this error code,
so this is a bug in your kernel. core_sys_select returns this code if a
signal is pending for the current process. You have the following
options:
* Test with the latest kernel. 2.6.9 is almost two years old.
* Ask RedHat to fix the problem in 2.6.9.
* Fix the problem yourself.
You may try applying something like the following to your current kernel
in order to understand how to reproduce the problem (untested):
diff -Naurp linux-2.6.orig/fs/select.c linux-2.6/fs/select.c
--- linux-2.6.orig/fs/select.c	2006-08-19 11:57:53.000000000 +0200
+++ linux-2.6/fs/select.c	2006-08-19 11:57:43.000000000 +0200
@@ -430,6 +430,8 @@ asmlinkage long sys_select(int n, fd_set
 		}
 	}
 
+	if (ret == -ERESTARTNOHAND)
+		BUG();
 	return ret;
 }
 
IIUC, this should print a backtrace every time the problem occurs.
With kind regards,
Baurzhan.
