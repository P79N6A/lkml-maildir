Hello List!
I'm using the new scheduler since a few days and I have to say that this is an 
amazing improvement for gaming loads. When playing enemy-territory the 
animations are completly smooth and fluid, without any hiccups. Et runs now 
clearly better on Linux than on my Win XP partition (same HW). I have never 
seen such smooth animations on any OS before.
(I have LD_PRELOADED a libnoyield ripped from a post here on lkml)
I can play et and have a 'nice make -j4' in the background and the only thing 
you notice is longer load-times/more latency on disk access. I can't tell if 
the compilation is finished or not while gaming ;-)
On everyday dektop usage there is a slight improvement too. But for me the 
current mainline scheduler has no problems. I couldn't tell which scheduler 
is in use by only doing desktop related things. Mainline scheduler is good 
and has no probs there.
I didn't find any severe regressions on my dual core system. No problems with 
sound or video even with make -j8 kernel compile in the background.
When I start a single cpu-hog it tends to jump around cores every second or 
so. I think that this is a regression to the current scheduler which tends to 
have a better affinity management on multicore.
Really nice work Con! ;-)
