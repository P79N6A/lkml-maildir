Coming right up.  (Will switch it to fget_light() too)

Interesting question.  sync_file_range() is purely a pagecache (ie: file
contents) operation.  It doesn't touch metadata at all.
So if it's being used for data-integrity purposes then it really only makes
sense when it's doing file overwrites.
It does call into the filesystem of course - a_ops.writepages() and perhaps
a_ops.writepage().
