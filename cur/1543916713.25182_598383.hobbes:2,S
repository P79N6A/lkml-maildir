Subject: [PATCH 2/2] powerpc: FULL_REGS on exec
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/24/466

When PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC is used, a ptrace call to fetch the registers at
the PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC stop (PTRACE_PEEKUSR) will oops in CHECK_FULL_REGS.
With recent versions, "gdb --args /bin/sh -c 'exec /bin/true'" and "run" at
the (gdb) prompt is sufficient to produce this.  I also have written an
isolated test case, see 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=301791#c15.
This change fixes the problem by clearing the low bit of pt_regs.trap in
start_thread so that FULL_REGS is true again.  This is correct since all of
the GPRs that "full" refers to are cleared in start_thread.
