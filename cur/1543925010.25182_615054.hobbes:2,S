Too bad.  The Penultimate Penguin wants zero to continue to mean "no IRQ".
Dig into the archives for multiple threads on this exact topic.
The end result is that "0" means "no IRQ".  If your physical IRQ actually
is the number 0, then reencode it to some other value for this purpose.
Yes, a bit of pain, but that's how many parts of the kernel expect it,
and in the end it's no more overall hassle than doing it differently might
have been.
