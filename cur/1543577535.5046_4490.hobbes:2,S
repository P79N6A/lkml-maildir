From the man page:
BUGS        Never use this function. If you do, note that:  
            This function modifies its first argument.  
            The identity of the delimiting character is lost.  
            This functions cannot be used on constant  strings.  
            The  strtok  () function uses a static buffer while
            parsing, so it's not thread safe. Use  strtok_r  ()
            if this matters to
you.
