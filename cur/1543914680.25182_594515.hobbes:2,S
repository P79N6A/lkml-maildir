I think this will require a rethink of either how the em2880-dvb
driver works or how frontend drivers work. The current API expects
users to initialise their frontend and then bind a tuner to it.
em2880-dvb is a sort of subdriver that attaches to the main driver,
and doesn't have any control over when or how it initialises its
tuner, so it can't delay tuner initialisation until the frontend has
been initialised. (I don't think it's the only hybrid driver that
works this way either). Of course, I could be missing something.

I'm not convinced this is entirely true. In order to avoid unnecessary
reinitialisation of the device, the driver needs to know whether the
device is in analog or digital mode, and I can't see a way of doing it
with the current API. (I think existing drivers, such as the xc2028
driver in one branch, use the older analog API and make the digital
driver a wrapper around it.) Again, I may be missing something.
