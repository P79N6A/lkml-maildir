Hmmm... I see.

It's probably caused by new sysfs slimdown patches and I'm pretty sure
-rc4-mm2 would fail the same way.  The offending one should be one of
the following patches.
gregkh-driver-sysfs-fix-parent-refcounting-during-rename-and-move.patch
gregkh-driver-sysfs-reorganize-sysfs_new_indoe-and-sysfs_create.patch
gregkh-driver-sysfs-use-iget_locked-instead-of-new_inode.patch
gregkh-driver-sysfs-fix-root-sysfs_dirent-root-dentry-association.patch
gregkh-driver-sysfs-move-s_active-functions-to-fs-sysfs-dirc.patch
gregkh-driver-sysfs-slim-down-sysfs_dirent-s_active.patch
gregkh-driver-sysfs-use-singly-linked-list-for-sysfs_dirent-tree.patch
Can you bisect the above patches?
