Hi: Just tried to boot 2.4.4-ac8 on my thinkpad: I have an eepro100
ethernet card, which works fine under 2.4.3-ac14 and 2.4.4  - when I tried
2.4.4-ac8 things got as far as pump trying to bring up the eth0 interface,
and the machine locked up - this happened a few times [I have not enabled
CONFIG_EEPRO100_PM, and have set CONFIG_EEPRO100=m], so I did a make
mrproper and recompiled and reinstalled the 2.4.4-ac8 kernel, which
resulted in a panic and lockup even earlier in the boot sequence:
something about not being able to handle a device with more than 16 heads.
Not a problem for me or anything, but if anyome wants me to try stuff out
or investigate further, I'd be happy to.
