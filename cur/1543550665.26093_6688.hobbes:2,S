Dear:
        My kernel is 2.2.5-15. I am studying buffer.c . And I  can not 
understand the relation or difference between generic_readpage() and 
getblk(). When I read a data file through a process they both are called . 
But I don't understand their order,relation,difference.
        Would you  please help me ?
        Thanks.
Best Wishes!
        yours Huang QingHua
