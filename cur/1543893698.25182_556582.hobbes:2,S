No way. None of the conceivable ways of burning out hardware are 
sufficiently safe to intentionally mass employ them like this. If you could 
overload the coil, the only imaginable way to burn out a speaker, it could 
start a fire. This risk is at least significant enough that it's easier to 
open the case than take it.
