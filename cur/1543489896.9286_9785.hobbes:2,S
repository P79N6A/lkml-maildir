		^^^^^^^ this is a bug: it has to be declared __volatile__

Agreed, printing regs->eip is a good idea. I'll do that here too.

I' don't like this because I want to do other useful things between the
two inb_p. If you look at my patches you'll notice I am doing things in
the middle.
And btw I am _far_ from silenty recover the system time. If you look
closely at my last and current patch (-B) you'll notice that I printk
always how many irqs are been lost.
