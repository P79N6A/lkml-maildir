No.  See C99 7.18.1.1:
     7.18.1.1 Exact-width integer types
1    The typedef name intN_t designates a signed integer type with
     width N, no padding bits, and a two's complement
     representation. Thus, int8_t denotes a signed integer type
     with a width of exactly 8 bits.
2    The typedef name uintN_t designates an unsigned integer type
     with width N. Thus, uint24_t denotes an unsigned integer
     type with a width of exactly 24 bits.
3    These types are optional. However, if an implementation
     provides integer types with widths of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits,
     it shall define the corresponding typedef names.
