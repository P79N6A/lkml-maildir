... which is completely all right in this case. We used to have an
implementation which tried to hold onto the task_struct and that sucked.
It is only possible for the task to disappear without notifying devio
under very special conditions only, which involve forking with parent
exiting. In other words, even a buggy application won't trigger this
without deliberately trying. And when it happens, uid checks make sure
that other users are not affected.

That may be useful.
The patch itself seems straightforward if we can trust your struct
pid thingies. If OpenVZ people approve, I don't mind.
