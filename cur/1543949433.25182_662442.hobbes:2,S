sure.
We could also add an in-commit-message marker for such changes, that you 
could periodically scan. Something like:
   User-ABI-extended-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
and:
   User-ABI-modified-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
that way you also know whom to contact about followup questions.
Declaring such changes would have other benefits as well: the review 
process becomes more streamlined. Also, any ABI side-effect would be 
known to be intentional versus unintentional, based on the commit 
headers alone. Undeclared ABI side-effects would be frowned upon and 
would be strong grounds for immediate reversal as well.
