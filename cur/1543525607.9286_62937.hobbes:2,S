Not easily: The fans would need a divisor of three which isn't supported (2
and 4 are the available options).
For the temperature there are 3 sources:
1) MB Temperature -> this one seems to be right
2) CPU Temperature -> calcualted from the cpu diode, it's off by unknown
offset and unknown factor; I haven't yet got enough data points to figure
out the correct compensation function.
3) External thermistor -> same problem as cpu temerature; currently I get
readings of around 13 deg. Centigrade. Guess I'll have to play with two
boards (one in Linux, one showing BIOS monitors, an external sensor and a
hair-dryer..
Bye, Martin
