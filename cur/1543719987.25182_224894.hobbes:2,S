This will break the building of all external modules until they are
updated, and break updated modules building against older kernels
unless they check the kernel version in the makefiles..  I suggest
leaving the 'build' link as is, and using a difference name for the
build directory, perhaps 'object'.  This might look confusing, so we
could have a 'source' link as well and remove the 'build' link when
most external modules have been updated.
