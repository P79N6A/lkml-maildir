I was surprised because I thought you were getting the BUG_ON during
writing the image. Now I see that it's well beforehand.

On this topic, would you be willing to test a 2.4 version that supported
highmem? I haven't written support yet, but hope to do it shortly. (I
don't have that much ram myself so you can send me 1GB if you prefer

Hmmm.. strange.
