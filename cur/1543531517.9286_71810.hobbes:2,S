A few comments about the Athlon under linux 2.2.12 and 2.3.51.
Under 2.3.51, this was the result of a time trial:
[1]    Done                          iter_comp -B2000 hex_trig1 > trash
205.360u 0.060s 1:42.94 199.5%  0+0k 0+0io 715pf+0w
The actual time was approximately 103s.  I have no idea why top thinks the
machine is SMP.
Under either 2.2.12 or 2.3.51 the floating point performance was about the
same (approximately 1.5 times faster than a PII 400MHz SMP machine I use).
Performance on compilation was better - about 1.75 times faster.
However, graphics is another matter.  Under linux 2.2.12, X is *very* slow - in
fact a total disaster (using AcceleratedX and a G400 MAX card).  We are talking
a factor of 10 here. Performance under 2.3.51, though not a disater,  is not 
great - in fact it is worse than under the PII 400MHz machine (by about 20%).  (AGP 2X).
Although I haven't compared 2.2.12 to 2.3.51 under Xfree3.3.5, I did compare
2.3.51 under Xfree3.3.5 and  AcceleratedX and Xfree3.3.5 was about 20% slower.
The graphics performance uising the PIII on the tests I was running was about the 
same using either a G400 MAX or a G400 - suggesting that under the PIII the limit
was either floating point performance (what I expected) or saturation of the 
memory bus (possible, but unlikely).
Any suggestions/comments as to what might be going (wr)on(g) here?
