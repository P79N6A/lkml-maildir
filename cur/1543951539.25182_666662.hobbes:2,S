Yes, it is what I thought.
But maybe we should try unifying slots names first, I think.

I'm not sure too. But I think we can unify the slot names using the
combination of chassis number and slot number among the controllers
which is based on PCI Hot-Plug spec.

Yes. It's the simplest workaround.
BTW, I'll be out of office tomorrow. So replying to this discussion
will be delayed. I'm sorry about that.
