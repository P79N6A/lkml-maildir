Subject: Data corruption reading IDE CD-ROM in 2.2.x

I've noticed a nasty problem with CD on 2.2.x including latest 2.2.14. The
problem manifests itself in corrupting every large file that is read from
CD. Corruption is repeatable, but not happen always in the same place in
the file - i.e., if I repeat the copy in small amount of time, it's the
same place, but if I wait some time, unmount the CD and mount it back,
etc., place of corruption can change. 
It doesn't seem to be hardware related bug, since if I downgrade to 2.2.5
from Redhat 6.0 RPMs, problem disappears. 
The application that always triggers the bug is rpm - when it is run on
large RPM from the CD, it says "unpacking of archive failed: cpio: Bad
magic", but it isn't program-related too - copy to HD makes the same
result (file is corrupted). No kernel messages or other errors are
reported - kernel thinks the file is OK, but it isn't.
The CD is SAMSUNG SC-140F.
