Yes, I think we misunderstood each other :)

No, no, we shouldn't change the old code, it is fine.
Just in case, to avoid any possible confusion.
put_pid(pid) has the following restrictions. The caller should ensure
that any other possible reference to this pid "owns" it (did get_pid()).
So we can add a new helper, put_pid_rcu(). It is ok if this pid is used
in parallel under rcu_read_lock() without bumping pid->count. Contrary,
the only restriction those users must not call get_pid(pid).
But yes, you are right, I don't see an immediate usage of put_pid_rcu().
Oleg.
