It would benefit other structures that *do* need it, but only for a
few fields.

As long as GCC generates code as it does, sure, it's madness.
However, what if it were to be run on a machine that can't address
smaller quantities than 64-bit?  Such a machine sounds silly, but it
could happen (just as early Alphas couldn't directly load or store
smaller than 32-bit quantities), and thus the compiler might want to
pad them so that they don't share a word.  If a way exists to express
to the compiler that the format of the struct is intended to be
exactly as specified, without causing any detrimental effect, why not
make use of it?
As an aside, what would *really* be nice is if GCC had an attribute
that lets one specify the endianness of the field, so that one
doesn't have to mess around with conversion functions/macros
uglifying the code.  It'd probably be faster, too, as the optimizer
could deal with the loads and stores like any other.
