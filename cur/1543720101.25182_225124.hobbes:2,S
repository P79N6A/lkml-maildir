when compiling linux-2.4.27-pre5 under a x86 architecture, I've a lot of 
warnings :
In file included from 
/usr/src/devel//usr/src/devel/include/linux/modules/i386_ksyms.ver:127:1: 
warning: "__ver_atomic_dec_and_lock" redefined
In file included from /usr/src/devel/include/linux/modversions.h:70,
                from <command line>:8:
/usr/src/devel/include/linux/modules/dec_and_lock.ver:1:1: warning: this 
is the location of the previous definition
__ver_atomic_dec_and_lock is declared two times. Maybe it lacks a #ifdef 
somewhere in the modversions.h no ?
The compilation doesn't fail bu it's not very nice :)
