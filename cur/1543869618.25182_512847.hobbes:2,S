What I was talking about was the following one.  It's a libata bug
discovered by devres sanity check and unrelated to ACPI.

    libata: disable pdev on all suspend events
    libata used disable pdev only on PM_EVENT_SUSPEND while re-enable pdev
    unconditionally.  This was okay before ref-counted pdev enable update
    but it now makes the pdev pinned after swsusp cycle (enabled twice but
    disabled only once) and devres sanity check whines about it.
    Fix it by unconditionally disabling pdev on all suspend events.
