It's my PERL, I've just run a test.  inotify_test.c works correctly and
shows the proper filenames.  My PERL script is sometims dropping the
first character, I've not been able to re-product the full junk ouput
(it was all Java source code!?).  I'll keep hunting.  Is there a place I
can subscribe to the inotify-announce list?
