Also, maybe it will be better to extend linux/lib/cmdline.c->{get_range(), get_range()}
to handle that stuff? And maybe new functionality can be built up-on the current one: 
- crashkernel=512M-2G:64M,2G-:128M@offset
+ crashkernel=512M-2G,64M,2G-,128M,,offset
?
OK, OK, you are already using and maintaining new syntax, but still.
