Subject: whining noise - possible bug in nForce2 support?

Don't know who else to ask about this: 
Just upgraded my mobo to a ECS N2U400-A nForce2 board, standard MCP
southbridge, latest BIOS.
CPU is AMD Athlon XP 1800+, 2x256MB PC266 RAM.
Kernel version is 2.6.7, tested distros are Slackware 10 and Knoppix 3.4.
Board work alright so far, but as soon as I start a 2.6 kernel, the board will
produce a high pitched whining sound.
This doesn't happen with 2.4 or a wide spread OS from Redmond, only with 2.6.
I tried test kernels without ACPI, APM and such, no success.
Interesting thing: as long as the hard disk has something to do, the noise
vanishes but returns as soon as the disk idles again.
This is way beyond me. Anybody got an idea?
