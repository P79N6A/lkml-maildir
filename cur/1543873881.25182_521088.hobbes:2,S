Hi list,
Comment in release_task() claims that group leader's parent process 
is signalled only if it desires so, which is not true.

To save your time, here's the contradictory code which don't appear in 
the patch (appears after its last line):
      leader = p->group_leader;
      if (leader != p && thread_group_empty(leader) && leader->exit_state == EXIT_ZOMBIE) {
		BUG_ON(leader->exit_signal == -1);
		do_notify_parent(leader, leader->exit_signal);
