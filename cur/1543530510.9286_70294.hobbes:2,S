Say you have 800MB virtual RAM, and you simulation currently uses 500MB.
And now, it tries to fork(2). Do you allow it, or does fork fail with 
-ENOMEM ? If you allow it, and one copy later just writes different data to
say 400MB of itself, it will run out of memory (because system will need to
create new page for COW, and would need 500MB+400MB, which is more than
800MB virtual RAM your machine have). Ka-boom, you process will die on
simple memory access (no syscall to check error from, since you allowed that
fork() which was last place to check it).
