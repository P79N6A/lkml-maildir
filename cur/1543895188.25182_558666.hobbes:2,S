Oh, I've just fixed two purely software bugs pointed out by binary searching
in the code that I'm sure has been tested, not only by its developers, but the
bugs only showed up in my configuration (on one out of four test boxes).
There are so many different kernel configurations possible that there's no way
a developer can test them all.
