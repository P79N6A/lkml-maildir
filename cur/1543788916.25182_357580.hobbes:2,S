Oh, and in the (more common) case when you don't actually know the commit 
ID, just the file that was changed, do
	git-whatchanged -p include/linux/textsearch.h
which shows only the commits (and the _parts_ of those commits) that 
change that particular file (or list of files: you don't have to limit 
yourself to just one file - you can track a whole directory or an 
arbitrary list of files/directories).
And no, my tree doesn't contain your patch. My tree just contains Al's 
first part, that added the typedef and replaced the existing users of 
"unsigned int __nocast gfp_mask" to use that typedef.
I'll merge the full series after 2.6.14..
