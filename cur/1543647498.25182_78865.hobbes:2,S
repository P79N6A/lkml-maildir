Guys, I think we are closing in on it.
I ran the patch through Lindent.  I moved the exported symbol to sys.c and 
made it GPL only.  I tested it on 2.4.19.
If we could agree on a header file location for the prototype, or not to 
have a prototype, I could cook up another candidate for "final" in short order.
Thanks for all the suggestions,
Dave
