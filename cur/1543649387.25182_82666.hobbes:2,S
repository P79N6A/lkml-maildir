I don't think the big picture is that complicated.   
epoll is useful for programs that use the old nonblocking socket API.
It improves performance significantly for a case where poll() and
select() are deficient (large numbers of slow or idle connections).
There are a number of people, including myself, who already use epoll.
At least some of us don't think it is too complicated.  I claim most
of the complication is in the nonblocking socket API, in which case
the complexity falls under the category of "the devil you know...".
The old nonblocking socket API (and hence epoll) does nothing for file
IO, and it just doesn't make sense relative to file IO.  (EAGAIN,
POLLIN, POLLOUT, etc. aren't terribly useful signals from a disk
device).
So, its a great thing that the new AIO API is forthcoming.
So maybe epoll's moment of utility is only transient.  It should have
been in the kernel a long time ago.  Is it too late now that AIO is
imminent?
