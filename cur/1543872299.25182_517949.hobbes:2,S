Hi Nick,
sorry for my later reply, this has been on my to answer list for the last
month and I only managed to get back to it now.

I really like this idea, especially for avoiding to call into the allocator
for every block.  Have you contacted the reiser4 folks whether this would
superceed their batch_write op completely?

Actually I think that's a a good thing to a certain extent.  It reminds
us that all other users are horrible abuse of the interface.  I'd even
go so far as to make batch_write a callback that the filesystem passes
to generic_file_aio_write to make clear it's not a generic thing but
a helper.  (It's not a generic thing because it's the upper layer writing
into the pagecache, not a pagecache to fs below operation).
The still leaves open on how to get rid of ->prepare_write and ->commit_write
compltely, and for that we'll probably need ->kernel_read and ->kernel_write
file operations.  But that's a step you shouldn't consider yet when doing
this work.

We should be able to find a nice abstraction for this, see my next mails.

This is a rather useless comment :)  Better remove it and add a proper
descriptions to Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt and
Documentation/filesystems/Locking
