For O_DIRECT, IMHO you should fail not fallback.  You're simply lying
to the underlying program otherwise.
In the ibu fs I am hacking on, the idea for O_DIRECT is to fail a read
if the file is small enough to fit in the inode.  If the O_DIRECT
action is a write, then I will invalidate the data in the inode,
then follow the standard path (which eventually calls get_block()).
For file tails (a different case from small-file-in-inode), I
imagine it would be prudent to support O_DIRECT for all actions
except reading the file tail.  If you want to be complicated, you
could provide userspace with a way to say "this is a dense file"
and/or simply not create a tail at all...
