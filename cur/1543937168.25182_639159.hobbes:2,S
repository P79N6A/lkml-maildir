Hm, this seems fairly wide-ranging.  How about just making it signed?  
In fact, all these masks which are of the form "all high bits set, some 
low bits clear" (or perhaps "all set except some") should be signed, so 
that the "all high bits set" property is maintained when its extended to 
larger types.
Also, Andi, do you want to get rid of the PHYSICAL_MASK stuff?
