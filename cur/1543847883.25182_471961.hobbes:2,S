agreed.
they look quite nice in that they also simplify the underlying locking. 
(instead of just trying to clone whatever locking yuckiness there is, 
into the lockdep space.)

ok to me. Sidenote: shouldnt we algorithmically forbid that "loop" 
scenario from occuring, as that possibility is what causes lockdep to 
complain about the worst-case scenario?
