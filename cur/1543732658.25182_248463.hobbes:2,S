So implement a plugin which knows how to talk to a userland program
which knows about metadata.  The plugin controls access to file-type.
Maybe there ought to be a general-purpose userland plugin interface?  So
that the only things left in the kernel are things that have to be there
for speed and/or sanity reasons?  (Things like cryptocompress and
standard file/directory plugins.)
