"New"?  That's how we old-timers used to have to comment shell scripts before 
"#" comments were added to /bin/sh.
The reason it's not used as a generic command substituter (usually in
Makefiles) is that it's a shell builtin.  make execvp's commands, so : would
fail unless you had in the command some kind of marker that told make to pass 
the command to sh instead (in older/non-GNU make, this mostly means
wildcards).

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
