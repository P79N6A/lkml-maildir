xdd on /dev/sda, sdb, etc. using -dio to do direct IO seems to work
decently, though it is hard (ie, impossible) to get a repeatable
sequence of IO when using higher queue depths, as it uses threads to
generate multiple requests.
You may also look at sgpdd_survey from Lustre's iokit, but I've not done
much with that -- it uses the sg devices to send lowlevel SCSI commands.
I've been playing around with some benchmark code using libaio, but it's
not in generally usable shape.
