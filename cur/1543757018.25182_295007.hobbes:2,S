Hello,
This is the latest version against 2.6.11-rc4:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.6/2.6.11-rc4/seccomp
I'd need it merged into mainline at some point, unless anybody has
strong arguments against it. All I can guarantee here, is that I'll back
it out myself in the future, iff Cpushare will fail and nobody else
started using it in the meantime for similar security purposes.
Thanks.
