But 2.6.22 doesn't need this change, why it was merged?
In fact, I suspect this change adds a race,

Suppose that ->refcnt == 1, and queue_process() was preempted just after
atomic_read(&npinfo->refcnt).
netpoll_cleanup() comes, cancel_delayed_work() does nothing, flush_scheduled_work()
sleeps.
queue_process() gets CPU, re-schedules ->tx_work, and returns.
flush_scheduled_work() completes, netpoll_cleanup() frees npinfo and returns
while ->tx_work is pending.
No?
