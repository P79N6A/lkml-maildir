IMO it's more like there has never been enough need for anybody to look 
into it, I bet...
The way drivers are written, you are typically must touch a few key 
hardware registers _anyway_, so the multiple messages in practice are 
not much more useful than the simple fact that your MSI irq handler 
function was called (with all that indicates and implies).
