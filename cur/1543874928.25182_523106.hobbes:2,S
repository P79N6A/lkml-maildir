sorry about it taking so long to get back to you. I noticed it still doesn't 
work after upgrading to fedora 6 and the newest kernel (at the time) so I thought I'd give your legacy driver a try (if you 
still have it) I'd love to have those 4 extra sata ports. Just a question with 
the legacy driver would the performance take a hit? I'd be using the ports to 
add more disks to raid arrays.
