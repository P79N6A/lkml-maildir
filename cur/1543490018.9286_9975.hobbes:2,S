Yeah, I remember that.  In fact, we conversed via email on that a while
back (my address from work is <Greg_Norris@mail.dor.state.mo.us>).

I spoke with him as well, around the time 2.2.[01] came out.  After
bouncing a few messages back and forth, I believe that we were
experiencing the same problem... both of us were seeing massive floods
of IPX broadcast packets, which would begin almost immediately.  I
suspect it's a problem with IPX itself, rather than with the oltr driver
(though you're quite correct about it being an Olicom card), because he
was using a 3c509 (I think that's right).  Last time I heard from him,
it still didn't work without pruning the kernel.  Of course, I've been
wrong before. ;)
The fix that was suggested to him was to remove/disable the section of
code referencing IPX_TYPE_PPROP in linux/net/ipx/af_ipx.c.  This seems
to work for me as well, though I haven't had a chance to try it yet with
2.2.3 (I keep hoping that "it's ok now" whenever a new version appears
<g>).  Unfortunately, this seems more like a temporary workaround than a
proper fix, as I'm sure a block of code that size must be there for a
reason... so I was hoping that providing a tcpdump might point one of
"them smart fellers" to the cause.
Take care!
