Ah, an old discussion - I imagine it must have occurred here a few times.
Anyway: k is the prefix for 1000, M is the prefix for 1000000. Always.
But there is a natural sloppiness, where people round numbers when either
the precise size is unimportant, or is clear from the context.
If xyzzies come in boxes of 27 and I say that I bought a hundred xyzzies
then that probably means that in fact I bought 108.
Thus, our old PDP8 with 4k of memory had 4096 12-bit words, that is,
6 KiB in modern terminology.
You see two very different situations here: "precise size is unimportant"
and "precise size is clear from the context". When someone says that she
bought a 10 GB disk I will assume that the precise size is somewhere
between 9.5 and 10.5 GB. This is the "rounded" case.
When someone says that she bought a 32 MB SIMM I will assume that this was
32 MiB, that is, 2^25 bytes, since, unlike disks, memory modules tend to
come in power-of-two units. This is the "clear from the context" case.
