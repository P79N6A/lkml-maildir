So, suppose we have two CPU intensive jobs, one SCHED_OTHER and the
other SCHED_BATCH.  If they have the same nice value, will/should the
scheduler favour one over the other?
I've done some testing on 2.6.25-rc2, x86-32 for this case, and it
appears that the two jobs are treated the same by the scheduler (each
gets 50% of CPU).  Is that expected behavior?  If it is, can you give
an example where scheduling SCHED_OTHER versus SCHED_BATCH should show
a difference in the amount of CPU received by each process?

Tested on 2.6.25-rc2, x86-32.  Two CPU intensive jobs, one
SCHED_OTHER, nice=+19, the other SCHED_IDLE.  The SCHED_OTHER job gets
~88% of CPU.  So SCHED_IDLE does indeed give a "super low nice"
effect.
Cheers,
Michael
