	I am not quite sure right now, but I remember having tried
	nolock using automount, and got log messages indicating
	"option not supported" (I have to check tomorrow morning
	at work).
	Moreover, we are using 'procmail' to redirect mail messages
	in home-based folders (ie, NFS folders), and are no longer
	using NFS mounted /var/spool/mail directory. We need to have
	some kind of locking mechanism for other utilities on our
	home NFS directories, so we can not anyway use 'nolock' to
	automount them (right ?).
	My feeling is that it would be better to fix the locking
	approach of mutt. Elm failed to work also with the new 2.2.x
	kernels : I did recompile it (it checks which locking method it
	can use during its configuration). But I have still one
	problem with elm : I tried to recompile elm-ME+ (with MIME
	support), and it fails during folder resynchronisation (at
	least it did fail with 2.2.0-pre7ac4).
	The symptom of the failure are as follows :
	MBOX is my NFS folder
	TMP is a working copy of MBOX in /tmp
	1 fopen(MBOX)
	2 unlink(MBOX)		: MBOX is still visible (from the Linux box)
	3 ftruncate(MBOX)
	4 fread(TMP, Buffer) & fwrite(MBOX, Buffer) (<=> copy TMP in MBOX)
	Up to now, MBOX is still visible from the Linux box
	5 fflush(MBOX)
	6 <a few seconds later> : MBOX has disappeared
	7 elm-ME+ does not like to have lost MBOX ;-( (and I do not either)
	It is working nice with the 2.0.x kernel serie. Maybe a(nother ?)
	cache problem with the new NFS layer ?
A+
