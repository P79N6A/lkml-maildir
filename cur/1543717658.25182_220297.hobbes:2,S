Here's a general rant^W discourse on volatile from Linus:

| I think the clobbering of memory by local_irq_save, et al. is not

| inhibits the compiler's ability to optimize more than volatile does. 
| When memory gets clobbered the compiler can't optimize other memory
| accesses in the function even though they are not involved in the
| critical region.  As compilers do more inlining the amount of
| optimization damage done by clobbering memory grows.
| 
| Existing code relies on the current clobbering instead of using volatile
| accesses, so I'm suggesting that there should be new, non-clobbering
| forms, e.g. local_irq_save_no_clobber, etc.  To use them correctly the
| accesses in the critical region must be to volatile objects, for
| example:
| 
| __inline__ void atomic_clear_mask (unsigned long mask, volatile unsigned
| long *addr) {
| 	unsigned long flags;
| 
| 	local_irq_save_no_clobber(flags);
| 	*addr &= ~mask;
| 	local_irq_restore_no_clobber(flags);
| }
| 
| This lets the compiler know exactly which accesses are to volatile
| objects and means that functions that call atomic_clear_mask can still
| be optimized.  Some of the C definitions of atomic_clear_mask in the
| sources already have this volatile qualification.
| 
| Is there any reason not to add local_irq_save_no_clobber, etc. (perhaps
| with better names)?

| replies.]
