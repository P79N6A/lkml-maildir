The steps I see that are needed are:
1. on initialisation, the kernel would select one PAT slot to setup
with the (eg) write combining attribute (and other slots for other
attrs)
2. expose an interface to the drivers to set the appropriate bit in a
page (range), based on searching the PAT slots, or using a known one
Intel document [1, section 10] that the uncacheable setting from PAT
or MTRR mechanisms takes precedence over the other mechanism, so the
situation will always be 'safe' (ie w/o cache corruption), and that
write-combining takes precedence over write-through or write-back MTRR
regions.
There are implementations that setup the PAT registers in userland or
in-driver and use the appropriate page flags to refer to the correct
PAT slot.
