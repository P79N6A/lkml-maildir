Ladies and Gentlemen,
Please enjoy my new article, "Let's Put SCO Behind Bars", which you may find at:
http://www.goingware.com/notes/prosecute-sco.html
Here's the introduction:
-------
While the lawsuits being defended by IBM and filed by Red Hat are likely to put 
an end to The SCO Group's menace to the Free Software community, I don't think 
simply putting the company out of business is likely to prevent us from being 
threatened this way again by other companies who are enemies to our community. I 
feel we need to send a stronger message.
If we all work together, we can put the executives of the SCO Group in prison 
where they belong.
If you live in the U.S., please write a letter to your state Attorney General. 
If you live elsewhere, please write your national or provincial law enforcement 
authorities. Please ask that the SCO Group be prosecuted for criminal fraud and 
extortion.
-------
If you agree with what I have to say, please copy it to your own website under 
the terms of the legal notice at the end of the article.  It has a Creative 
Commons license.  The page is deliberately designed to be easy to copy to other 
websites: it is all in one file, with very simple, valid markup, and with no 
external dependencies such as images or external stylesheets.  It even looks 
good in lynx!
Thank you for your attention.
Mike
