My PAS-16 is pre-ISA-PnP, so it doesn't get configured, there are also
Sound Blasters out there that aren't ISA-PnP-able (although at work my ISA
SB was found and configured correctly, nice).
So I must use command line parameters or go with modular sound, but my
card isn't always happy with modules, especially if they get unloaded and
reloaded (that was in 2.2.14, I'm not sure now, cause I don't do that
anymore).
