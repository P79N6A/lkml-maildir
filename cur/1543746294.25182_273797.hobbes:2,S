Hello
man netdevice says:
"IFF_NOARP	No arp protocol, L2 deswtination address not set".
Is it possible to run ptp Ethernet link between two Linux routers this
way? I would like to run the link with two constraints:
1) no ARP protocol used
2) The link should continue to work even if root access to one computer is
inaccessible and the NIC in the other one is replaced without changing it's MAC
(for example because it doesn't support MAC change)
