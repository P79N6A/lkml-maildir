Hello,
in the meantime I have tested kernel 2.6.6-rc2, but still no luck. I also 
played around with acpi_irq_nobalance and pci=noacpi, etc. But this does not 
fix it (Don´t know wht to do with flags, tagged as IA-32, because mine is a 
AMD64)
Maybe I forget something in my attached logfile: I use a Gigabyte K8N Pro with 
a NForce3 chipset.
Is there someone, who is interested in finding out, what is wrong? I would 
like to help fixing this, but I only could be a tester.
Thanks
Christian
