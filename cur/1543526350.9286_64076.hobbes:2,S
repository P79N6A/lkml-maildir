In 2.3.47 pre3 in /drivers/block.md.c function md__init
line 3317 fails on make due to MAX_MD_DEV not being undeclared, i
believe an S has been left off, and it should be MAX_MD_DEVS. I changed
it and it worked for me.
The actual line is question is
devfs_register_series (devfs_handle, "%u", MAX_MD_DEV,DEVFS_FL_DEFAULT,
MAJOR_NR, 0, S_IFBLK |S_IRUSR |S_IWUSR, 0, 0, &md_fops, NULL);
which i where i changed MAX_MD_DEV to MAX_MD_DEVS
Im very pleased to see raid 0.90 in, thanks for your work.
