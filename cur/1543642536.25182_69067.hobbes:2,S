Your answer is 100% wrong:
- You see this problem only with recent binutils, so a workaround would be
  to _downgrade_ binutils.
- These .text.exit errors are generally considered bugs in the kernel.
  (Most of them are already fixed in recent kernels.)
- I suspect CONFIG_DE2104X and/or CONFIG_DM9102 is set in the .config, and
  then it's a well-known error.
