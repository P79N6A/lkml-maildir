Hmm.. Interesting.

Could be. It sounds fairly unlikely, but timing-related bugs are always
the worst to find. I wonder what it was that pushed the system over the
edge in the later 2.2.x (we had a _lot_ of this in the 2.0.x timeframe: 
people who had run 1.2.x with no problems and suddenly got problems due to
2.0 being better at utilizing the hardware). 
But yes, for the time being I will just assume it is hardware-related, and
just wait for the reports to continue.
