BUG_ON() only panics when panic_on_oops == T, no?
But let me repeat, this is minor issue. I agree with WARN().

No, it will sleep forever, unless I missed something.
Even if ->worklist is empty, ->current_work != NULL, we are ->current_work.
We insert the barrier work and call wait_for_completion(). But nobody
can do complete() except us.

If we keep this path then we have the different patch ;) In that
case of course BUG_ON() is overkill.
But again, as Peter says, we already have the warning from lockdep.
