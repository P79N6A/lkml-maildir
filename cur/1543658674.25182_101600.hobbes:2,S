I  would  think it is probably not. I have seen this also when running
things  like  "badblocks  /dev/hdb"  and  the  kswapd  eats up all CPU
recourses.  Then  again I am always using ReiserFS so I do not know if
the  ReiserFS  is the cause or not.. But judging from badblocks is not
FS dependantI think there is no wrong with ReiserFS =)
