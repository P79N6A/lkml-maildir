It is, it is at 0x0E0, and it does, although the following is needed for that
driver (which I have built as a module):
  # setserial /dev/ttyS2 irq 3 uart none; modprobe smsc-ircc2

Hmm... I've seen that page before - the backlight control program which is
available there works on my M700. (I don't remember what I was looking for at
the time; probably something to do with the graphics hardware and why atyfb
makes a complete mess of the display. Yes, it's a Rage Mobility, 1002:4c4d;
yes, I can test patches.)

I suspect that there's a *lot* of similarity...
