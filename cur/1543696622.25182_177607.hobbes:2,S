Interestingly, tg3, which had a slight tendency to hang on 2.4.22 when duplex
mismatched seems rock solid now. I could even force renegociation and duplex
mismatches during heavy loads (pktgen) without even a warning in the logs.
No pb so far on a test server (DL320 P4/CSB6 IDE/TG3). Good work !
Cheers,
Willy
