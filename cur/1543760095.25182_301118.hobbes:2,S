  From a user's perspective, I tend to agree with Joel. A read going
past EOF should IMHO return the data till EOF and reflect it in the
return value. The penalty incured by the trailing part going buffered
is the price to pay for not having a fully aligned file.
  I think doing otherwise would break read(2) semantics.
