   Is Matrox G200 on this list ( or where can I find this  document ? )
   I am not addicted to Q3  :) , but testing my DRI configuration
   Q3 locks my system in 2-3   min after game start   . 
Ask AMD, they won't tell us...
My rule has been, if AGP usage makes it hang under Linux it must be on
their list.  Does this answer your question? :-)
