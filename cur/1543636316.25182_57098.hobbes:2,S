The only reliable way to detect that a retransmitted segment has been
lost is timeout. You can't use dupacks, because at this point they are
not necessarily caused by lost retransmissions. They might be caused by
duplicates, delayed packets, or the acks themselves might be delayed.
You could end up with shrinking the congestion window unnecessarily or
just plain bad retransmission behaviour. Note that if SACK is enabled,
the transmitter will not retransmit too many unnecessary segments
anyway.
