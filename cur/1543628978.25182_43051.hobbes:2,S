Thanks.
I sucess to boot linux-2.5.11.

I change kernel configuration that is Processor type and features section.
Already I set off "Symmetric multi-processing support".
Now I add to set on "Local APIC support on uniprocessorts" and "IO-APIC support
on uniprocessors", then I compile kernel, few waring displayed , but boot up successful.
