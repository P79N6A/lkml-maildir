The linux-hotplug package doesn't directly allow you to do automatic
mounts of filesystems that are plugged in, but it could :)
Right now it's focusing on automatically loading the proper kernel
driver for any device that has been plugged in.  See the
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net/
 site for more docs on it.
