I don't have references to back me up, don't take my word for it:
but I'm sure that the correct behaviour for a partially successful
read or write in any UNIX is that it return the count done, O_SYNC
or not, and file position should match that count; only when none
has been done is -1 returned with errno set.  Most implementations will
get this wrong in one corner or another, but that's how it should be.
