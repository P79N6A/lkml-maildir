Can you elaborate a bit?  Why can't it protect the code?

I can but I don't think it's worth the effort.  It will involve passing
@owner parameter down through kobject to sysfs but the path is pretty
obscure and thus difficult to test.  I think it's too much work for the
users of the API and it will be easy to pass the wrong @owner and go
unnoticed.
Thanks.
