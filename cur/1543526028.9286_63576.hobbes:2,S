First:	There is something called vold (SUN haters please keep quiet)
        for Linux too for management of removable media.  No need to
        patch the kernel as far as i know (i don't use this stuff).
Second: Floppy hardware on PCs is broken (unlike CDROM or ZIP handling),
	it will let you eject a mounted disk because the eject is
	mechanical and not host-controlled.  For host-controlled
	devices there is no problem:  just use some script which
	"umount"s the filesystem and "eject"s the medium.  All pieces
	are there and completely in user-land.  Only thing needed for
	Mac-like handling is for vold to register itself to be notified
	when the eject button is pressed. I am not sure if this is
	possible for all devices.
Conclusion: No need to get excited, all necessary mechanismens are there
	and can be utilized today.  Just remember: Unix is user-friendly,
	it's just selective about its friends...
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
