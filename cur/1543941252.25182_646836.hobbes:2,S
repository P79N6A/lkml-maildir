hi there,
since i'm not on the list... how about:
tail /proc/1/smaps and check the address size...
on 32 bit: ffffe000-fffff000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0          [vdso]
on 64 bit: ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0
[vdso]
there you can clearly see that your address space is double... so
there's your 32 bit vs 64 bit
as a normal user, you can do the same but with your own processes
greetings,
