I realize this, however I expected you to mainly look at the the 10
network related patches, namely: 11/40 - 20/40.
I know they build upon the previous 10 patches, which are mostly VM, and
you seem to have an interest in that as well, so that would be 20
patches to look at. Still a sizable set.
How would you prefer I present these?
The other patches are NFS and iSCSI, I'd not expect you to review those
in depth.
