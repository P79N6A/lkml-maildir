Commit ec22559e0b7a05283a3413bda5d177e42c950e23 added the following 
function to drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
int usb_serial_suspend(struct usb_interface *intf, pm_message_t message)
{
        struct usb_serial *serial = usb_get_intfdata(intf);
        struct usb_serial_port *port;
        int i, r = 0;
        if (serial) {
                for (i = 0; i < serial->num_ports; ++i) {
                        port = serial->port[i];
                        if (port)
                                kill_traffic(port);
                }
        }
        if (serial->type->suspend)
                serial->type->suspend(serial, message);
        return r;
}
...
<--  snip  -->
The Coverity checker spotted the inconsequent NULL checking for "serial".
Looking at the code it also doesn't seem to have been intended to always 
return 0.
