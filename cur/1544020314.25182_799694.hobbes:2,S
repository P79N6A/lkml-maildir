No; it's needed to make sure that any concurrent
switch_to_thread_hw_breakpoint() call has completed.  That's where the
important RCU read lock is taken.  The routine is called not just by
update_this_cpu() (and indirectly by load_debug_registers()) but also
by __register_user_hw_breakpoint(), __unregister_user_hw_breakpoint(),
and the task-switch routine.
It's possible that the IPI from on_each_cpu() could interrupt an
instance of switch_to_thread_hw_breakpoint() -- thereby causing it to
run recursively.  After the inner instance returns and the IPI is over,
the outer instance will realize what has happened and restart itself.  
synchronize_rcu() insures that update_all_cpus() will wait until the
outer instance is done.
In fact, the RCU read lock in load_debug_registers() probably isn't 
necessary.  But it's cleaner to leave it in; it points out that the 
routine accesses data structures which are protected by RCU.
