Thanks, perhaps new versions of mkfs.ext2 should be defaulted to this.

What a pitty... 
I think that this important improvement (it's not a "new feature") should
be backported to 2.2.x. Could we have a "stable" 2.3.x version? ;-)
The behaviour of page cache and buffers in 2.2.10 is far from optimal in
a database/web server, it even swaps out processes for cacheing data
files (including few seconds idle apache daemons).

Yup, I installed 2.3.7 only for trying the database because someone (I
think Linus) asked for doing it.
