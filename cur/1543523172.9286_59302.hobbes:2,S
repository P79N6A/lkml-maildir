OK, I took the suggestion to go to 2.3.40 and try that out, and I still get 
the keyboard timeout, but now I get my ide drives loosing interrupts.  It 
didn't log this one.  It took 10 minutes to get to RTC, I gave up and 
rebooted into my stock debian 2.0.36 kernel (its really quiet, I haven't had 
sound in a while)
