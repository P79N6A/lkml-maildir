Ahh.  I was confused by the hlist in 'struct pid'.  You are very correct.
Suka actually coded up something very, very similar to what you have.  I
just made him remove some of it so that the patches could be more easily
reviewed.  I figured we could add the fully dynamic allocation later,
which you have already done.  That part of your patches is remarkably
similar.
