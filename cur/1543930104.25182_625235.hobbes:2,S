Copy that.  Thus far, I've tested it on a pure AMD engineering sample, an intel
x86_64 box, and the affected system, a quad socket dual core AMD system with an
nvidia chipset.  That last system is currently the only system that this patch
will check/enable the broadcast flag on.  I did try a variant of the patch on
the AMD engineering sample where it enabled the bit unconditionally.
Interestingly enough, the bit was already turned on on that system.  I'm
wondering if most systems don't already have this bit turned on.  You should be
able to universally enable this bit, by moving the call to
check_hypertransport_config to the top of early_quirks()
