[PATCH] PCI: clarify pci.txt wrt IRQ allocation
I think we should make it explicit that PCI IRQs shouldn't be relied
upon until after pci_enable_device().  This patch:
    
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.7-rc3/2.6.7-rc3-mm1/broken-out/bk-acpi.patch
does PCI interrupt routing (based on ACPI _PRT) and IRQ allocation
at pci_enable_device()-time.
(To avoid breaking things in 2.6, the above patch still allocates
all PCI IRQs in pci_acpi_init(), before any drivers are initialized.
But that shouldn't be needed by correct drivers, and I'd like to
remove it in 2.7.)
