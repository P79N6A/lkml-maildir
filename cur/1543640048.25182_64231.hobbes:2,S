you are right, indeed 'releasing basic thread state' is the correct
concept. Any sane threading library merges this with the stackframe, this
is why i keep referring to it as the stack. Basic thread state has to be
intact for signal handlers to function even in the last moment.

you have applied my independent-pointer patch already, but i think your
CLEARTID variant is the most elegant solution: it reuses a clone argument,
thus reduces the number of arguments and it's also a nice conceptual pair
to the existing SETTID call. And the TID field can be used as a 'usage'
field as well, because the TID (PID) can never be 0, reducing the number
of fields in the TCB. And we can change the userspace locking code to use
the TID field no problem.
personally i'd make it even more compact by merging the two clone flags as
well, something along: CLONE_MANAGE_TID. I cannot see any reason for a
thread library to use one of the bits only. This also reflects the fact
that it's thread state that the kernel helps managing, both in the
thread-create and in the thread-exit path. But this might be stretching
things a bit?
patch against BK-curr attached.
