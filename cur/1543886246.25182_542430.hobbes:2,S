get_property() got renamed to of_get_property().
You have two coding-styles in the typecasting here.  The former (no space)
is more common and makes more sense, IMO.
However of_get_property() returns const void* so really you shouldn't be
doing any casting at all.  `model' should have type `const char *' and then
you can do
	model = get_property(np, "model", NULL);
which has nice type-safety and const-correctness.
