Does this differ from previous kernel versions?
There haven't been many (any ?) changes to the OCHI
driver lately.

Subject: OHCI USB problems?
I got 2.3.51 compiled for my iMac (without errors! yay!) and it's
working fine, except that it seems to have "issues" with the builtin
USB hub.  On bootup, or whenever a new USB device is plugged in, I get 
the messages:
hub.c: port 2 connection change
hub.c: portstatus 101, change 1, High Speed
hub.c: portstatus 103, change 10, High Speed
usb.c: USB new device connect, assigned device number 2
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb-ohci.c: unlink URB timeout!
usb.c: USB device not functioning, giving up (error=-12)
hub.c: hub: disabling port 2
I've tried it using both full HID and HIDBP support, although I don't
think it's strictly a HID issue, since my zip250 drive does the same
thing.
