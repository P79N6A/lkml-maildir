well, not really -- it is "reserved" right now too, it is just root is
allowed to use up all the reserved entries in the beginning and then when
the normal user uses up all the "non-reserved" ones (from slab
cache) there would be nothing left for the root.
But let us not argue about the above definition of "reserved" -- that is
not productive. Let's do something productive -- namely, take your idea to
the next logical step. Since you have proven that the freelist mechanism
or concept of "reserve file structures" is not 100% satisfactory as is
then how about removing the freelist altogether? I.e. what about serving
each allocation request directly from the slab cache and imposing any
"reserved for root" policy purely by the nr_xxx_files counters?
The only argument against such idea would be "taking elements off the
freelist is probably faster than allocating from slab". But maybe not? Who
measured it? if slab allocator is so fast that the difference is
negligible then applying the same idea all over the kernel (e.g. to
superblocks etc) will remove a lot of code, which is a good thing.
