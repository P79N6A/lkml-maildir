Well, I do actually have objections, mainly because I think it modifies
code that I'd rather have cleaned up in other ways _first_ (ie the return
path to user mode, which has pending irq_count/bh_count/preempt issues
that I consider to be about a million times more important than batch
scheduling).
So I'd rather have the non-batch stuff done first and independently.
