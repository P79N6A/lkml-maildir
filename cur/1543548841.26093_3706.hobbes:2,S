	True, but ssh checks for an authentic key from the server,
and if ssh is set up properly, it may eliminate at least some malicious
attacks (ie someone sending bogus metadata).  Even though CVS can use ssh, it
irks me that it doesn't by default and you have to set it up.  i'm a lazy
bastard; i like things to be set to safe defaults so i don't have to change
them.
