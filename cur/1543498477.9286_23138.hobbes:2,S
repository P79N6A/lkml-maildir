Why should this be a problem or a bug? I used to run NetBSD on a SS5-170
and you could get the LED to indicate the load! Blink once a second for
a load between 0-1, once every two seconds for a load between 1-2, etc.
Pretty cool, if you ask me. They probably just changed the code the drives
the LED.
Btw. I don't have that SS5-170 anymore, so I can't test anything. Also,
Linux never did run very well on the Fujitsu CPU that box has...
