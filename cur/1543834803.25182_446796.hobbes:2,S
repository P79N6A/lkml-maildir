We only specify ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN, since that aligns only the kmalloc
caches, but it doesn't disable debugging on other caches that are created
via kmem_cache_create() where an alignment of e.g. 0 is specified.
The point of the first patch is: why should the slab cache be allowed to chose
an aligment that is less than what the caller specified? This does very likely
break things.
