Thanks for the correction. 
My experiments need to reduce CPU speed. However, I can only reduce the speed by about 30% (from 2.67GHz to 2GHz) with ACPI. That is not enough for the experiments. 
p4-clockmod has not been removed from 2.6.29. It is under the same directory as acpi-cpufreq (arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq). So I thought it was an alternative approach. But I could not get it loaded.
