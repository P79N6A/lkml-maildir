As Segher mentioned, bus_to_virt is unportable, so it's definitely the
wrong thing to use.
I don't recall what you suggested instead, but I seem to recall that the
discussion kind of went "oh, right, the layering is all broken".
Any ideas?  Should this turn from a one-liner into a
big-refactor-for-2.6.18 patch?
