It depends. Some of these integrated gadgets aren't very successful;
others, however, are. Compare true modems to winmodems, or modern
videocards with built-in rendering etc to bare ones. Also, on embedded
systems with very tight memory and speed requirements, a TOE card may be a
bad, but the only available solution.
So, IMO, a proposed kernel model must have the means to support similar
devices. Some will be bad, but some may be good.
