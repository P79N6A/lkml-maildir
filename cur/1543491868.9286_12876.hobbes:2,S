Hello,
I was trying to configure 2.2.5-ac3 using "make menuconfig" and
found that asking for help about "Network device support/WAN interface"
gives what seems to be a general help text about "make menuconfig".
(starts with "Menuconfig gives the Linux kernel a long needed face
lift."
(BTW, this is for a Pentium-II laptop, in case this matters to the
configuration script)
NOTE:  Please "CC:" replies to me, as I'm not subscribed to this

Cheers,
