We will be fine up until the point that the set of all readahead fills the 
entire cache, then we will start dropping *some* of the readahead.  This will 
degrade gracefully: if the set of readahead is twice as large as cache then 
half the readahead will be dropped.  We will drop the readahead in coherent 
chunks so that it can be re-read in one disk seek.  This is not such bad 
behaviour.
All this assuming you don't enforce the 1 second size limit on the inactive 
queue, of course.
We probably could squeeze a little better performance out of this case by 
magically knowing that no input page will ever be reused, as you suggest.  
We risk getting such an improvement at the expensive of other, more typical 
loads.
That said, I think I might be able to come up with something that uses 
specific knowledge about readahead to squeeze a little better performance out 
of your example case without breaking loads that are already working pretty 
well.  It will require another lru list - this is not something we want to do 
right now, don't you agree?
