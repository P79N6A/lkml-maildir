is racy.  The module can be unloaded after if (drv->owner) and before
try_inc_mod_count.  To prevent that race, drv itself must be locked
around calls to get_driver().
The "normal" method is to have a high level lock that controls the drv
list and to take that lock in the register and unregister routines and
around the call to try_inc_mod_count.  drv->bus->lock is no good,
anything that relies on reading drv without a lock or module reference
count is racy.  I suggest you add a global driverfs_lock.
