Hi.
Somehow, this functionality got lost (or was never there)
in the IDE driver.  I have a drive which never recovers
from problems without this patch.  Please apply to whatever
the next release will be.
The patch only kicks in on "DeviceFault" errors (formerly called
the "werr" bit, status 0x20), we already have a mechanism to ignore
this bit in cases where it (already) rarely is misreported ("nowerr").
Cheers
