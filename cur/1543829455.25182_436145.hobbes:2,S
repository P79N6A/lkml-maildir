... and which happens to be useless for 10% of the male population (and 
even more if you look specifically at Asian people). But then, I just 
pasted that part from somewhere else.
Besides, I rarely have a fondue fork handy when I sit in front of the 
computer. I actually do not own one. And when I am sitting in front of the 
computer, shops typically are closed (yeah, I am living in Germany, but we 
_do_ have cars...). So at least for 100% of the writers of this email, 
your warning just does not apply.
Ciao,
Dscho
