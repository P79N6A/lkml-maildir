It is just fatally confused BIOS.  Your NVidia needs 256MB region for its 
framebuffer apperture, but BIOS assigned 256MB for it at 0xE0000000, and later 
it revoked second half of this assignment in favor of AGP aperture.  Which on 
electrical level means that only first 128MB of nvidia will be accessible from CPU.
While Windows will probably just complain loudly that from specified 256MB range 
only 128MB is routed down to the adapter, and maybe even nvidia driver will cope 
with it, using only 128MB of RAM, for Linux (rightly so) adapter is unusable, as 
it wanted 256MB allocation for BAR1, but kernel could satisfy only 128MB without 
redoing all PCI address space layout.
Besides going back to older BIOS I would recommend using different AGP aperture 
size in the BIOS - with 256MB aperture I believe that you'll not trigger this 
BIOS bug.
If it won't help, then you can try fiddling with pcibios_resource_survey() - if 
you'll disable it, all resources should be assigned from scratch by 
pci_assign_unassigned_resources.  This way kernel should be able to find 256MB 
chunk for adapter.  To be able to use this aproach you definitely want to 
disable legacy (or any...) support for USB in the BIOS, you do not want to use 
vesa framebuffer, and maybe some other problems as well - it can break constants 
encoded into ACPI tables :-(
