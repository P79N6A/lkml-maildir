Yes, but that's a user space problem too. Nothing prevents your
distribution to crank up the volume to 100% also on a first-time
installation.
The kernel should pick a value that's safe in all cases. And
this is zero. Don't forget that there can be several seconds
between the driver's initialization and the moment when the
user-space utility gets to change the settings.
