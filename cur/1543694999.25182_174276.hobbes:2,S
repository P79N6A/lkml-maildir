That is why Dominik seperated the acpi cpufreq driver in 2 files in his
cleanup patch.  Others cpufreq drivers may use acpi to retrieve infos
if needed.  Even though by now K7 do not support that, it can be changed
for (the doc. seems to be under NDA, but AMD seems willing to cooperate).
Looking around some other asl, it seems also that if you verify that
_PCT return FFixedHW, but length and address are both different to 0,
it may be possible that a generic driver via MSR could work, but there
is nothing in specs afaik (and specs can be changed if compatible..).
