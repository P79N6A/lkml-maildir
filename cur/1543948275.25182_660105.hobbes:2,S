This fixes it, not sure if its not just papering over, though it seams to be
likely for an offlined CPU to have ticks stopped.

Don't touch an offlined CPU's ts->tick_stopped in tick_cancel_sched_timer()
Silences WARN_ONs in rcu_enter_nohz() and rcu_exit_nohz(), which appeared
before caused by (repeated) calls to:
        $ echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
        $ echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
