Making the variable show up in two places is reasonable.
Removing it from it's current location is not, as there are currently
no technical reasons to make the change.
Unless something dramatic shows up 2.7 isn't going to happen.
If you want something like that to happen use:
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt

Don't move it just add it to the correct location.  But also leave
it at it's old location.  Then put something in
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt that says in six months or
so it will be gone, from the bad location.

That 69 is not kernel internal it is exported to user space,
which is why changing that is wrong.

No because it isn't kernel internal.  Which is why I mentioned
sys_sysctl.  It uses that 69 as part of the path to that variable.
