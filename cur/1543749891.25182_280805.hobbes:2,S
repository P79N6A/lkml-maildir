This BUG happens when there are two outstanding read (or write)
requests for the same piece of storage (more accurately, two "bio"s
that overlap).
raid5 cannot currently handle this situation.
Most filesystems would never make requests like this.
I note that you are using reiserfs in this case.  It is possible that
reiserfs with tail-packing enabled could do this.
I doubt very much that this would happen with ext3.  I don't know
about xfs, but I doubt it would happen their either.
When using some other filesystem, what sort of data corruption are you
getting?
