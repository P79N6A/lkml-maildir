Side note: while I absolutely think that is the right thing to do, that's
also the much more "interesting" change. As a result, I'd be happier if it
went through channels (ie probably Andrew) and had some wider testing
first at least in the form of a CFT on linux-kernel.
[ Or has it already been in 2.4.x in any major tree? (In which case my
  testing argument is lessened to some degree and it's mainly just to
  verify that the forward-port works). ]
Thanks,
