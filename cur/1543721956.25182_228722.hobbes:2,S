Hi
I am doing some research that deals with patches to the kernel.  Here are my
questions:
[1]  I have obtained the patches for different versions of the kernel from a
mirror website.  However, they do not tell me who are the authors of these
patches and what are their addresses/emails.  How can I get this
information?
[2]  What is the actual process of approval of a patch that goes into the
kernel?
Thanks.
Arun
