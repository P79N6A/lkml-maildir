There needs to be VFS support, but the fact is that different existing
filesystems already have different security mechanisms (think about
AFS+kerberos, for example), so we need to leave as much of the policy
as possible to the individual filesystems.
Given that in a secure configuration we'll be doing an ACL lookup for
every executable file anyway, it would make sense to keep the
capabilities in the same structures as the ACLs on disk.
