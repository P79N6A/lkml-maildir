Hi,
There is a preliminary patch available for both, dosemu-0.98.8 and
dosemu-0.99.13:
  
ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/pub/dosemu/testing/patch-0.98.8.1.gz
                                   ...    patch-0.99.13.1.gz
which solves the problem on kernels >= 2.3.27. This solution was found
by intensive diskussions with Andrea Arcangeli, Steffen Winterfeld,
Eric Biedermann, Alistair MacDonnald and me  (not to forget Linus,
who gave valuable comments). Thanks all for helping with this problem.
The 'fix' ended up to be a bit big, because I had to rewrite the whole
mapping stuff, hence you may imagine, that it may contain bugs, which we
now need to find ;-)
So please people, do havy testing of this patch on 2.3.x kernels
and report back. And as Linus also doesn't exclude bugs in the kernel
(because we use a feature of 2.3.x, that wasn't used much this way till
now), we need to find those eventual bugs too ...
                                     ... before primetime of Linux-2.4.
Thanks,
Hans

PS: kernel people, please keep me in the Cc as I'm not listening
