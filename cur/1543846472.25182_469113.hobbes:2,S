You really don't get it, do you.  The way ld.so works can be implemented
in many other forms with other programs.  With some time and energy you
likely can write a perl or python script to do it.  "ld.so" is a place
holder for everything userlevel that wants to map executables.

They can do it anyway.

And for obvious reasons I ignored it.
noexec mounts the way _you_ want them are completely, utterly useless.
nonexec mounts as they are today plus an upcoming mprotect patch give
fine grained control.  You have to use additional mechanism like SELinux
to fill in all the holes but that's OK.  nonexec mounts give a great
deal more of flexibility.
