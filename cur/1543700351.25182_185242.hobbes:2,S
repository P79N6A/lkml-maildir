The placement of some keys seems to have changed over time.  For
example, tilde was once shift-0, whilst shift-caret was once overbar.
My keyboard is marked in this way, and I am used to using shift-0 for
tilde, however, shift-caret is apparently now popular as tilde, with
shift-0 producing nothing.
Backslash and Yen share the same code in 8-bit variations of
ASCII-based.  Therefore, the lower-right backslash key and the
upper-right Yen key may in some cases be used interchangably.
However, with unicode representations, both backslash and Yen and
tilde and overbar have separate codes and I personally think it would
be a good idea to default to the traditional key-mappings, so that
these characters can be easily input on systems which correctly
support them.
Note - whilst I am fairly sure the above information is accurate, I am
less sure about the following:
As I understand it there was traditionally a distinction between pipe,
(a broken vertical line), and bar, (solid vertical line).
The markings on my keyboard are as follows:
Pipe is the fourth character on the lower-right backslash key.
Bar is the second character on the upper-right yen key.
However, my keyboard emulates a US one in Set 2, and produces the
Linux 'pipe' symbol, for example as in
cat foo | less
when the bar key is pressed.
