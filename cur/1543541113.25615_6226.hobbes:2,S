Sorry about the causticness, such vitriolic language usually doesn't help foster the discussions I would like to see take place on this list.  The frustrations of developing on the Linux kernel get to you after a while...  But I would like to know why JFFS hasn't been removed if it was an accident.  This seems a little strange to me.  Notably after a 'feature freeze', and the valid hypothesis that it was for Transmeta to be able to have a good filesystem for their palm/web/lap top devices.  Which would really, really invalidate the "Linus went to work for a neutral vendor to preserve the integrity of the OS" propaganda that I see...
