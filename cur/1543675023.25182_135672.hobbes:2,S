Hi,
	please CC hamilton@sedsystems.ca with responses/dicsussion 
regarding this posting.
	We developped a modulator card and device driver for linux. The 
card is a PCI card. When installed in an IBM E-server, dual processor xeon 
computer, the linux kernel does not receive any interupts. If I cat 
/proc/interrupts, the card is assigned interrupt 10 on the XT-PIC. The 
only other device assigned to the XT-PIC is cascade. When we check the 
card's intterupt line with an oscilloscope, we see that an interrupt is 
being generated.
	A temporary work around is to use the noapic flag with the kernel. 
I am wondering if there is a special call when requesting the interrupt 
that I can use to get the interrupt to go through the APIC so I don't need 
the noapic flag?
