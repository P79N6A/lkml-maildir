I filled an entry on redhat's bugzilla, but the response was
"keep the terminal minimised while doing heavy terminal output".
I quit redhat next day.
I could translate this to "Look mom, I can config my kernel while blindfolded!!!" ;)
I wonder if someone has produced an small test-case for this,
which works on 2.4 and dies in 2.5 or 2.6... it would then
be "easy" to check and fix the apps.
Greets, Antonio.
