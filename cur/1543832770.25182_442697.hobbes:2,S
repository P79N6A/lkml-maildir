I understand your decision but this does not follow the USB spec. According 
to the spec, two threads should be able to perform operations on the same 
device at the same time.

This is exactly what I suggested in my first email. It just involves adding a 
couple of lines of code, but I'm not sure how the unlock function works in 
2.4. In 2.6, the device is unlocked WITHIN proc_bulk before usb_bulk_mesg is 
called and is locked after usb_bulk_mesg returns. Therefore, the device is 
still locked during control transfers.
Thanks,
Ben
