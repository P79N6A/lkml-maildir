since there are subsystems out there which are managed separatly this
doesn't work out.
I wasn't happy when I noticed that patches got applied to the
sourcecode I contributed without notifying me while I still worked on
that code separatly
It was moreover the fault of the subsystem maintainer to not notify me
back then but a centralized bugreporting (as bugzilla) tool would at
least have notified me, or I would have been able to see the suggested
changes there.
But I agree with that if you're only 1 level far away from the linux kernel.

it's just easy to miss something here, if an ext3 bug comes in and all
people who're involved in the ext3 filesytem are on vacation I'm sure
they won't read all the mails which came in during a week, now take a
part of the kernel which is smaller than the ext3 filesystem (eg. usb
gadgets, smaller drivers)
