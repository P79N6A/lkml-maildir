Are you sure it needs memory? Usually, you need address-space
to flash firmware. Also, in recent months, I've evaluated a
lot of NVRAM from flash to single-bit SEEPROM. I have never
seen anything that would `know` how to flash from DMA.
Typically, with NVRAM, you scribble some 0xaaa, 0x555, 0xetc, at some
specified offset, then you write a single byte/word/longword (depending
upon its addressing), at the location to program. Then you loop, waiting
for it to "take", then you do the next. All stuff you would never do with
DMA.
If all you need is a kernel buffer to store the stuff that will be
written to NVRAM, then just use kmalloc(). It is virtual and will
seem contiguous to your driver.
If you have to 'bus-master' data from your buffer to the NVRAM, you
just do it one page at a time, using the same page.
