I downloaded the pcmcia-cs 3.1.24 package and hand-merged the bugfix(es?)
into 2.4.1's xirc2ps_cs.c.  A(n attempt at a) patch to bring 2.4.1
up to pcmcia-cs's version is attached to this email.  So far, no
problems, but it'll be at least 48 hours before I can say whether
it happens or not..  This is also available at
http://incandescent.mp3revolution.net/kernel/xirc2ps_cs/.
Looking through logs, it appears as though the problem first
appeared in kernel 2.4.1-pre7, and has become frequent enough
to annoy me as of 2.4.1.  Did anything change dealing w/ this
driver/card between 2.4.0 and 2.4.1-pre7?
