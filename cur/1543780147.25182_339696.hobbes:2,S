Glad to see this. After it lands in the tree I'll fix up about ten
places where I have attribute processing wrong because of this. Is
there some place in the sysfs doc that this can be mentioned?
Another thing that should be cleared up is if the attributes are
described by length or zero termination. Right now they get both. I
suspect the right answer here is supposed to be by length.
