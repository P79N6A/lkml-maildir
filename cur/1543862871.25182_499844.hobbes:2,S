Subject: Vectored AIO breakage for sockets and pipes ?

The call to aio_advance_iovec() in aio_rw_vect_retry() becomes problematic
when it comes to pipe and socket operations which internally modify/advance
the iovec themselves. As a result AIO writes to sockets fail to return
the correct result. 
I'm not sure what the best way to fix this is. One option is to always make
a copy of the iovec and pass that down. Any other thoughts ?
