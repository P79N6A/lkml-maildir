	Then one the file twice. With one fd, you can do your buffered, random
accesses. With the other fd, you can do your non-buffered, sequential
accesses.
	Also, I think you should still be allowed to seek forwards. You may have,
for example, a file with large records whose headers tell you their length
and whether or not you need to read them.
