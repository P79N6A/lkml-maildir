I see:
Loading libata.ko module
Loading ata_piix.ko module
ACPI: PCI interupt 0000:00:1f.2[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 169
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xFE00 ctl 0xFE12 bmdma 0xFEA0 irq 169
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xFE20 ctl 0xFE32 bmdma 0xFEA0 irq 169
then raid autorun, one of the raid partitions is on /dev/sda
No panic on ata_piix load.
The panix is on killing init, it is the standard panix from not having
a root device.
I just built it in instead as a module, I'll try that next and see if
says anything different.
