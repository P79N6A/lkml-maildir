Hi
first of all thanks for your reply, 
I think that user space code always has to make the best use of cache as it
can... in other words, i don't want to use a cpu exclusively for a device
that delivers 6000 ints/second
I bound an irq to a cpu because I thought that:
as spin_irq_locks just disables interrupts locally I should get better
latency that just one ISR on that particular cpu could at least reduce
a little the number of times that interrupts get disabled on that cpu
... that was my reasoning...
but latency gets worse... that's not comphrensible for me...
