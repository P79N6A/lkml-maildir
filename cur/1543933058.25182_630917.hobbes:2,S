"current offset" is your subject.
But I would tend to agree to "(most) kernel messages are not sentences."
Actually, I see it a bit different: (most) kernel messages are more like an
itemized list of what has been done/is going to be done. A *list*!
 * water
 * flour
 * salt
 * yeast or baking powder
 * dough (obviously)
(I'm a programmer, not a cook.) Would you really add a fullstop?

+1. Those kernel messages which clearly have two or more sentences
obviously have sentences. ("If a device doesn't work, try "pci=routeirq".)
Can we get back to programming?
