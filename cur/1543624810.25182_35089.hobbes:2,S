Sorry, weekend in sight ;-)
admin:/p2/backup on /backup type nfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,timeo=20,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,addr=192.168.1.2)
admin:/p3/suse/6.4 on /var/adm/mount type nfs (ro,intr,addr=192.168.1.2)
BTW: another fs mounted from a different server on the same client is not affected at all from this troubles.
Are there any userspace tools with problems involved? mount ? maybe I should replace something ...
Regards,
Stephan
