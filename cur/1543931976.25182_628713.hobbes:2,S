How many patches do you want to send only for saving 120 bytes in some 
configurations (and even not the ones people who really care about the 
kernel size usually use)?
And most C files in the kernel would allow you to save more than
120 bytes if you don't mind how tihe source code looks like and e.g. 
don't mind turning it into an #ifdef mess.
If you care about the kernel size, you could e.g. help in fighting 
removals of unused EXPORT_SYMBOL's through Andrew instead - these are 
space saving patches that neither make the C code look worse nor can 
have negative impact on the generated code.
