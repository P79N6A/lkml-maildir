Now a technical rather than emotional response...

A valid point. But there should be some kind of error notification if  
firmware loading hasn't happened correctly rather than a permanent  
asynchronous wait in which the interface fails to turn up. Possibly a  
kernel information printk or something, which does not exist at the  
moment.

Unclear. My point was that when ifconfig up exits, the interface  
should be up, not asynchronously waiting for firmware to be loaded,  
then taken up in the background. Thus, firmware loading in this case  
should be kept synchronous, in my opinion.

  Basically, you have a device which can carry out different  
functions depending on the firmware loaded into it. Driver A is  
specific to this device, and loads the firmware. Driver B uses  
functions exported by Driver A to carry out one particular function  
of the device. Driver C uses the same functions to carry out a  
totally different function on the same device, but with different  
firmware loaded.
Add in multiple devices handled by Driver A, all with different  
functionality, and sometimes with combinations of functionality that  
can coexist, and you see that when Driver A loads it cannot possibly  
know which firmware to load, but must wait for other Drivers to turn  
up and be put into use. Thus it 'pretends' to handle all the devices  
until it's forced to make a choice.
Yes, this is hellishly complicated. Blame Intel :)

Addressed in previous email.

Absolutely. I said this in an earlier email and suggested rejecting  
this patchset on the grounds that it was another bodge covering over  
a fundamentally broken area of the kernel :)
