I'd LOVE to hear what happens on the box with 2.3.36. Ifyour NEC has a
cardbus controller (most modern laptops do), 2.3.36 has a completely
rewritten cardbus layer, and I'll be jumping up and down with joy about
repors about it.
To enable the new cardbus layer, please just say Y to the PCMCIA and
cardbus questions and say N to i82365 support.
