uhm, the user just resized the buffer - he will not be wondering about any 
impact.
And that's why we should do a full reset: that makes it abundantly clear 
what happened. We shouldnt pretend to be able to do something (seemless, 
lightweight buffer size change with no visible impact) which we obviously 
cannot reliably offer.
Buffer resize is a slow op, and everyone realizes that. Most people will 
in fact say: "hey, I didnt even need to reboot to change the trace buffer 
size, cool!".
The current "only allow resizing while tracing is disabled" is an 
unintuitive and counterproductive restriction - a borderline bug in fact.
