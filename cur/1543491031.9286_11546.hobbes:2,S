Linux 2.0.36   RedHat 5.2
Hello,
We are using three systems with the same Linux 2.0.36 version.
One has no timer problem, meanwhile two other systems are going back
by 15 minutes a day.
Differences:
The two machines having this timer troubles have both an integrated
Adaptec 7800 Adaptec controller and a 3c905 10/100 network controller.
These motherboards are Asus P2B-D/P2B-DS Dual Pentium.
/proc/interrupts of one of the systems:
 0:  168097280   timer
 1:       6597   keyboard
 2:          0   cascade
 8:          1 + rtc
11:   33829457   eth0
12:    7321490   aic7xxx
13:   15201284 + IPI
We can turn around this problem installing a networked timer server based on
nist package from frank@icce.rug.nl
Before we deliver such solution, is someone having an idea from where the
problem is coming (dual processor, integrated aic7xxx, etc)
Regards
E. Soriano
