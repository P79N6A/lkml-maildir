No. It CANNOT lead to an OOM condition.

No, that makes OOM situations MORE likely.

That shifts the problem from a system-level to a user-level problem.
This might be an acceptable "solution" for some, but isn't practical
in many environments (or indeed possible with Linux ATM).

Also makes things worse; instead of a high general limit, you start
hitting lots of much lower limits.

Not necessarily "killing" - just "signalling". Properly written, a
program should be able to handle the signal and exit gracefully. If it
doesn't handle a "something's wrong" signal, can we expect it to check
every malloc() call for an equivalent return value?
