Ok, thank you for the explination, this all makes a good deal more sense to me
now.  Ben is near the machine, so hopefully we'll hear from him soon with the
results of this test.
Given that, do you think the cpu-switch test that I proposed would be a good
solution now (with the fallback mechanism I described), or would a command line
8259 solution be better?  I tend to think the former would be better since it
would be transparent to the user, but I'd like to have that debate.
