(replying to myself to avert flames)  OK, after reading the RCU docs, in
all fairness there is a lot more to it than I described, in particular
the database analogy is not quite valid because most of the hard parts
are handled automagically by the DB.  But, my point remains valid, RCU
seems like too general a concept to be patentable, and would probably be
obvious to many people on this list.
