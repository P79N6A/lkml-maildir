Hi Tridge, Andrew,
Tridge, thanks for your note.  I'm glad to hear you are using idr.c.
I agree with your concerns about idr_remove().  It really should
fail gracefully and warn if the id being removed is not valid.
The attached patch against linux-2.6.9 should do the job without
additional overhead.  Andrew, I hope you will add this patch to
your tree.
With the existing code, removing an id which was not allocated
could remove a valid id which shares the same lowest layer of the 
radix tree.
I ran a kernel with this patch but have not done any tests to force
a failure.
