With the code in the latest -bk tree, if you simply create a struct
class and name it "firmware", and then just create a struct class_device
for any struct device that wants firmware to be loaded, you will get a
hotplug event generated for you (with the name "firmware")
automatically.  That is a lot simpler than the firmware.c code you
posted.

As all devices in the kernel should now be in sysfs (if not, please let
me know what busses haven't been converted yet), I think the firmware
class is a much simpler way to go.  You get the hotplug call for free,
and a sysfs entry where the firmware can be dumped to, if you want to do
it that way.
