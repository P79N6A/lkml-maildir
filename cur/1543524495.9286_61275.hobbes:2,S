Subject: Strange problem with 2.3.42
	Hiho developers,
	 I discovered 2 problems with 2.3.42:
	 1) When I compile it for a K6 maschine the kernel hangs after "Loading
..."
	    It's probably a compiler problem, maybe using -march=k6 is no good
idea.
Can't help there.    
	 2) Using a Pentium version of the kernel works until short before the
prompt.
 	   He starts up normally even loads all my daemons and servers and
shows me
 	   my login shell, after authentificating myself the mschine just does
nothing.
 	   I can logon on all tty's but'll never get a shell; he seems o
hangs, however
 	   I can break this by pressing Ctrl-C and get back my login prompt.
Get the latest util-linux pkg. 2.10e. As usual the Changes file is not
current with the dev. kernels. Configure it to get you a new passwd and
login.
Worked for me and I already had 2.10. This showed up in a 2.3.41pre for
me.
