	This rapid skip-around doesn't make sense; NIC sends things
	strictly serialized.
	(Digging syslogs..  Oh..)
Feb 14 06:55:58 nic smtp[20906]: S3799AbQBNEyA: to=<kumon@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>,
	delay=00:01:58, xdelay=00:00:33, mailer=smtp,
	relay=fgwmail.fujitsu.co.jp ([164.71.1.133|25|193.166.0.145|57913]),
	stat=deferred smtp; 500 (Error on SMTP response read: Connection reset
				 by peer, Cmd: .) cvt=NONE
	A few tens, if not hundreds of those.
	(hmm.. 0-5-12 per hour per troubled gw at syslogs..)
	And it seems to re-occur:
Feb 16 07:13:10 nic smtp[29593]: S18933AbQBPFDj: to=<kumon@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>, 
	delay=00:09:31, xdelay=00:00:03, mailer=smtp,
	relay=fgwmail.fujitsu.co.jp ([164.71.1.133|25|193.166.0.145|47112]),
	stat=deferred smtp; 500 (Error on SMTP response read: Connection reset
				 by peer, Cmd: .) cvt=NONE
	Especially   fgwmail   and   fgwnews  seem to exhibit this
	behaviour,  fgwmail5  and  fgwmail6  don't show up at "bad boys"
	statistics.
    289 fgwnews.all
     54 fgwnews.not-ok
    730 fgwmail.all
    116 fgwmail.not-ok
     84 fgwmail5.all
      0 fgwmail5.not-ok
     73 fgwmail6.all
      0 fgwmail6.not-ok
	This covers from  Feb 13 02:48:48 (UTC +0200) until snapshot
	moment (Feb 17, 13:11, UTC +0200).
	I would say   fwgmail  is having SERIOUS problems, and  fgwnews
	nearly as bad.
	Out of memory (RAM+SWAP) ?  Out disk-space ?
	I don't know what mechanisms can cause sendmail to groak.

	Hmm.. Only about 170 instances covering a lot longer timespan..

	Running  
http://www.zmailer.org/mxverify-cgi.html
  with
	your address doesn't reveal *currently* any problems.
	And for that matter, it never would reveal problems, where
	DATA+dot gets accepted, but not acknowledged.
