Right, bus address space is really a separate entity; I was just using IOMMUs 
as an example of that...

I don't know of any offhand (yeah does sound gross).

Yep, but that's just an artifact of the way PCs are typically laid out.  
There's nothing preventing certain platforms from doing things differently, 
either with special bridges or just funky address space layout.

Yeah, that would be an improvement...

Right.

I think we can just kill that test...
