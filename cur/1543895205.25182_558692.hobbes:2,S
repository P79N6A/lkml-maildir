Uwe has an attitude that made many people (including Linus himself) 
set their mail filters to deliver his emails directly to /dev/null.
Parts of the contents of his emails were usable including usable 
regression reports - but the way he treats people simply disqualified 
him.

I'm not seeing anything in Thomas' email that could be considered 
offensive. He told you in a technical way why he disagrees with you.
If you call this email "rather offensive", you should _really_ 
unsubscribe from lkml (or even any Debian mailing lists). And this is 
not meant against you, it's simply that for the standards of lkml there 
is nothing offensive in this email.
