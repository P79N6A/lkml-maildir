Can you do another test with this (ie in-kernel pcmcia), AND enable
debugging in both drivers/pci/pci.c and in arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.h (in
both cases, just change the #undef DEBUG to a #define DEBUG and recompile
the kernel).
In addition, you might want to change the yenta_allocate_res() thing in
drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c to allocate more than 4MB of PCI memory window.
Change the line that says
	align = size = 4*1024*1024;
to something like
	align = size = 32*1024*1024;
and see if that makes any difference.. But the DEBUG output is the most
interesting part.
