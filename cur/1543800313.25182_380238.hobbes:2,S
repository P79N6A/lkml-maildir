I think that's just a throwback to an earlier rev of the driver.

OK.

It was written in a pre-udev world, so it still uses a fixed major and
minor number.  How important is this to you?  Is it "nice to have", or

I'm working on the appropriate hearts and minds as we speak :-)

Because that's too specific to HT for my personal liking.
