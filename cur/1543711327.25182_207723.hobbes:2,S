I missed the actual workload, will search the archives later.
Fear I won't reproduce it exactly, and more anxious to plug
the mremap-move and non-linear holes.

I don't much care whether we return 1 or 0 in that case, be happy to
make the change if we understand _why_ it's suddenly become necessary.
I don't remember seeing an explanation from you (and fair enough, you
didn't want to get stuck on that detail) or anyone else.

I can't take its mm/mmap.c (and if Martin keeps that page_table_lock
avoidance in his tree, then I think he shouldn't have followed your
advice to skip Dave's mmap_sem in unuse_process).  But of course,
I could have started from exactly yours and then a patch to change
those back.  Just so long as we're aware they're not identical.
Hmm, where's page_test_and_clear_dirty gone in your final objrmap.c?
There's a lot that could be shared between the two approaches.
Nice if we kept to the same struct page layout: I put int mapcount
after atomic_t count because almost all arches have atomic_t as an
int, so won't that placing save us 4 bytes on the 64-bit arches?
