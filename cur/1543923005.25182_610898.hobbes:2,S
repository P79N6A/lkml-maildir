When introducing the make O=...
I was a bit anal about where the definition of O came from so you will see
that in the top-level Makefile we check if O= is defined at the commandline:
ifdef O
  ifeq ("$(origin O)", "command line")
    KBUILD_OUTPUT := $(O)
  endif
endif
"O" is just too vague to be picked up from the environment.
