You mean "err" I guess?

Note that the EAX output constraint is re-used in the input section for
(u32)val, i.e. the lower half of the value to be written. And "wrmsr"
needs that in EAX, so you cannot change the output constraint without
touching the input constraint.
Also, I do not see how the compiler could do any better than having the
return value already in EAX, but that doesn't really mean anything ;-)
