I understand this quite well since I do business in both the US and
Germany. But I do find the courts quite similar too, from reading the
newspapers in both countries.  But even in the US, things differ from
one court to the next.  Anyway, the problem the GPL may have with
dynamic loading is that the loading is done by the user and not the
distributer, which is who the GPL states is under the obligation of the
license.
