 Hi all,
 After the feedback on fwfs, here is my new attempt to move the firmware
 to userspace.
 This time there is working hotplug functionality including preliminary
 firmware.* hotplug scripts.
 Attached goes the README and sample driver code for easy inspection and
 a full tarball for testing.
 Have a nice day
 	Manuel

Let us have the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to
change the things we can, and wisdom to know the difference.
 request_firmware() hotplug interface:
 ------------------------------------
 This is not finished code, but most of the functionality is already there.
 Why:
 ---
 Today, the most extended way to use firmware in the Linux kernel is linking
 it statically in a header file. Which has political and technical issues:
  1) Some firmware is not legal to redistribute.
  2) The firmware occupies memory permanently, even though it often is just
     used once.
  3) Some people, like the Debian crowd, don't consider some firmware free
     enough and remove entire drivers (e.g.: keyspan).
 What:
 ----
 My current plan consists on implementing two pieces:
 1) A simple interface for drivers to ask for a named piece of firmware via
    hotplug.
 2) A default way to get the firmware from user space into a [virtually]
    contiguous memory buffer for drivers to use with ease.
	- Currently fwfs
 Drivers should be able to use 1) without using 2) as shown in
 firmware_sample_driver.c. In that case arrangements should be made for
 hotplug scripts to do the firmware load by themselves either via sysfs or some
 way else.
 
 As much information as possible should be set on the environment so hotplug
 scripts can do the job when 1) is used without 2). Currently just an string
 provided by the driver is set as 'DEVICE'. Once ported to 2.5 'struct device'
 can be used instead and more information will be available.
 Notes:
 -----
 - Even though the Makefile has 2.5 support the code does not. I'll port it
   once we agree on how all this should be done.
 - Why I don't think any more that sysfs is good as "the default" for
   userspace to provide the firmware:
	- For drivers providing a sysfs entry for firmware:
		It will be trivial to use request_firmware() and arrange the
		hotplug scripts to get it copied to their sysfs firmware
		entry. They don't need any additional support for copying the
		firmware from userspace.
	- For drivers not providing a sysfs entry for firmware:
		They just want the appropriate firmware in a memory buffer. It
		doesn't make much sense to hack some code to get a sysfs entry
		for them and then tell hotplug where to copy the firmware.
		The driver won't know that the entry is there, and it won't
		make sense to write data to it unless requested via hotplug.
   If fwfs is finally not found appropriate, I think that a simpler more
   specific implementation should be better.
	
 - Why OPTIONALLY caching the firmware in-kernel may be a good idea sometimes:
 
	- If the device that needs the firmware is needed to access the
	  filesystem. When upon some error the device has to be reset and the
	  firmware reloaded, it won't be possible to get it from userspace.
	  e.g.:
		- A diskless client with a network card that needs firmware.
		- The filesystem is stored in a disk behind an scsi device
		  that needs firmware.
	- On embedded systems (like install floppies) where there is no
	  userspace hotplug support, 'cp firmware_file /firmware/' can be
	  handy.
	  
   And the same device can be needed to access the filesystem or not depending
   on the setup, so I think that the choice on what firmware to cache should
   be left to userspace.
 - Why register_firmware()+__init can be useful:
 	- For boot devices needing firmware.
	- To make the transition easier:
		The firmware can be declared __init and register_firmware()
		called on module_init. Then the firmware is warranted to be
		there even if "firmware hotplug userspace" is not there jet or
		it doesn't jet provide the needed firmware.
		Once the firmware is widely available in userspace, it can be
		removed from the kernel. Or made optional (CONFIG_.*_FIRMWARE).
	In either case, if firmware hotplug support is there, it can move the
	firmware out of kernel memory into the real filesystem for later
	usage (like the provided hotplug scripts do).
