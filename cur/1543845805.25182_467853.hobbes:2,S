I guess it could deadlock if you tried to add /dev/md0 as a component
of /dev/md0.  I should probably check for that somewhere.
In other cases the array->member ordering ensures there is no
deadlock.

Hmm... I"m pretty sure I do want some sort of locking there - to make
sure that the
		if (atomic_read(&mddev->active)>2) {
test in do_md_stop actually means something.  However it does seem
that the locking I have doesn't really guarantee anything much.
But I really think that this locking order should be allowed.  md
should ensure that there are never any loops in the array->member
ordering, and somehow that needs to be communicated to lockdep.
One of the items on my todo list is to sort out the lifetime rules of
md devices (once accessed, they currently never disappear).  Getting
this locking right should be part of that.
