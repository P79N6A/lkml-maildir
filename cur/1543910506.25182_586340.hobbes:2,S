I see. Sounds sane. We would be able to see what happen in real world.
However, implementation is really right?

This test is really here? The error is always "0", and it seems
anybody doesn't check after that.
And please separate the check like following
	error = check_mode(sbi, attr->ia_mode);
	if (error && sbi->options.quiet)
		error = 0;
