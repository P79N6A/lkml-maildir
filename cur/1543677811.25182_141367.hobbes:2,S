Hello,
When I run the following program, and block the terminal's output
(C-s), the `select' doesn't seem to have any effect, resulting in a
100% cpu usage (this is on a RH8, with 2.4.18).  I wouldn't be
surprised if I'm doing something stupid, but it does seem to work fine
on Solaris.
Is there anything wrong with this, or is this some bug?

#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  int flags, fd, len; fd_set writefds;
  fd = 1;
  flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0);
  fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
  while (1) {
    FD_ZERO(&writefds);
    FD_SET(fd, &writefds);
    len = select(fd + 1, NULL, &writefds, NULL, NULL);
    if (!FD_ISSET(fd,&writefds)) exit(0);
    len = write(fd, "hi\n", 3);
  }
  fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags);
}
