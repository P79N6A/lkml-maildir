That isn't poetry. We'll be doing Finnish jokes next 8). I'm also not
sure that kernel documentation in rhyme is the best idea:
---------------
Ah look at all the laundered pages
Ah look at all the laundered pages
Handling Pages
Pick up the list and the link where kswap has been
A paging scheme
Runs down the I/O
Watching the queues that now keep me a list of the store
Who is it for
All the laundered pages
Where do they all come from
All the laundered pages
Where do they all belong
Meeting bdflush
Writing the pages of a disk file that no one will clear
No task comes near
Look at it working
Sleeping a lot in the night when there's no pressure there
What does it care
All the laundered pages
Where do they all come from
All the laundered pages
Where do they all belong
Ah look at all the laundered pages
Ah look at all the laundered pages
Oracle DB
Died under load and was freed along with its name
No admin came
Good old bdflush
Wiping the dirt from the pages as it walks down the chain
Nothing was aged
All the laundered pages
(Ah look at all the laundered pages)
Where do they all come from
All the laundered pages
(Ah look at all the laundered pages)
Where do they all belong
