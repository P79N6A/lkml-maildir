Interesting, but I think you pinpointed the _real_ bug.
TIF_SINGLESTEP very much should be enough to force do_notify_resume() to 
be run on return to user space.
Sounds like somebody is testing _TIF_WORK_MASK rather than 
_TIF_ALLWORK_MASK.
I'd suspect the "work_pending" case. Looks like we miss testing the TIF 
flags there.
Oh, actually, I think you should just remove the clearing of 
_TIF_SINGLESTEP from _TIF_WORK_MASK. Does that fix the bug.
