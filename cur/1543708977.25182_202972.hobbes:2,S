No... swap is never touched !
But I think to have found where the problem is:
if I only create an ISO image of 672.4 MB I must wait more then 5 minutes... 
this means about 2.2 MB/s !
If I write a CD at 16x (~2400 KB/s) how can the image creation process be to 
the step with the writing one?
OK, if I create an ISO image I must (read from)/(write to) the disk, while 
burning on-the-fly requires only "read from disk".... But what happens if I 
write at 24x / 32x / 40x ???
Is 2,2 MB/s one acceptable speed?

I have also noticed that raising the writing speed (24x/32x) I have the same 
problems with the buffer also having created the ISO image!
