So you want a "Do you want Qlogic drivers" question followed by the 6
drivers if Y?
I'm less enthused about that.  I know there's precedent for it in the
net drivers, but I've always thought it caused more confusion than it
removed.  Traditionally, in SCSI, we've always presented every possible
driver in our list.
I thought the initial complaint you were trying to fix was the "why does
this show up in my .config one"?
