Whether or not you can drop the lock is a card dependant issue.  It's
not possible to simply say "Drop the lock" in all cases as some of the
card drivers have notes in there that they can't be interrupted in any
form while spinning or bad things happen, etc, etc.  Someone is more
than welcome to look into those drivers, but I personally haven't had
the time to decipher that many more pieces of SCSI hardware than I
already deal with.  Secondly, be prepared to experience weird things
when dropping these locks.  If you get things right then that's great,
but if you don't it may not show up until you have two cards in the same
machine that are active at the same time or other similar scenarios to
force the possible newly introduced bug up to the front.
