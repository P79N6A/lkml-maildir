Hi folks, 
I was trying to get answer to my question around, but no one knows.
I do have DMA turned on, etc, yet - on extensive harddrive operations wait 
time is 90+% , which means that machine is waiting, rather than doing 
something meanwhile. (I guess). 
Can someone describe to me , in more detail why is that happening, and what 
steps should I consider to avoid it ? I couldn't find any answers that would 
have help me on net.
thanks.
