Subject: [PATCH] preempt_count is int - remove cast and don't assign to unsigned type

Andrew,
Seeing that you merged my streamline-preempt_count-type-across-archs.patch 
(thanks), I believe the small patch below is in order. Please consider it 
for inclusion.
In kernel/sched.c the return value from preempt_count() is cast to an int. 
That made sense when preempt_count was defined as different types on 
different archs, but now that all archs use int for preempt_count the cast 
is not needed and should go away. The patch removes the cast.
In kernel/timer.c the return value from preempt_count() is assigned to a 
variable of type u32 and then that unsigned value is later compared to 
preempt_count(). Since preempt_count() returns an int, an int is what 
should be used to store its return value. Storing the result in an 
unsigned 32bit integer made a tiny bit of sense back when preempt_count 
was different types on different archs, but no more - let's not play 
signed vs unsigned comparison games when we don't have to. The patch 
modifies the code to use an int to hold the value.
While I was around that bit of code I also made two changes to a nearby 
(related) printk() - I modified it to specify the loglevel explicitly and 
also broke the line into a few pieces to avoid it being longer than 80 
chars and clarified the text a bit.
