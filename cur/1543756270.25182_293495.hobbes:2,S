As Arjan said - what you probably want to be doing instead is changing
the code in your first module that provides the bufproc_* functions so
that they're wrappers around some code that does the "real work", and
then call the real_work function from your second module.  Most likely,
what you *really* want to be passing around is some 'struct *foo', and
the bufproc_* functions are converting to/from a struct foo and a linear
byte stream.  (In the limiting case where it's just one variable, why not
just 'EXPORT_SYMBOL(variable)' in the first module and then just assign or
read the variable from the second module?)
