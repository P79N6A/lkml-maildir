I'm aware that there are pitfalls, one of the very first things I looked 
at was the usage of FIRST_USER_PGD_NR in mm/mmap.c:1513 On my main 
platform (i386) FIRST_USER_PGD_NR is zero which causes gcc -W to warn 
about   if (start_index < FIRST_USER_PGD_NR)   but, after seeing that it 
is not 0 on all platforms I left that one alone.

Shutting up gcc is not the primary goal here, the goal is/was to  
a) review the code and make sure that it is safe and correct, and fix it 
when it is not.
b) remove comparisons that are just a waste of CPU cycles when the result 
is always true or false (in *all* cases on *all* archs).

I'll keep that firmly in mind and only submit patches for these kind of 
things if I find usage that is actually (provably) buggy or where it's 
completely clear that a comparison will *always* be true or false on all 
architectures and removing it does not decrease readability.
I hope that's a more resonable aproach.
Whether or not the list of potential patches is now down to zero remains 
to be seen, but it just got a hell of a lot shorter. :)
Thank you for the feedback.
