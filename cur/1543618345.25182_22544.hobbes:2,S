pgd cache is fine too, the page fault will update the pgd using
swapper_pg_dir accordingly if needed. The swapper_pg_dir will only fault
in new pmd, it will never deallocate them (vfree only invalidates the
pte and free the pages), so it's safe. If vfree would deallocate them
just a simple context switch would break, no matter of the pgd cache.
