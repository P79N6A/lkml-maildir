You lucky devil. Someone else reported 92 if I remember rightly. This really 
needs to be called a 2.6.24 bug. Stick the word "regression" in the subject 
line and someone will notice...
The warning might provide useful information to someone looking at a dmesg 
but given that people are hitting them way too hard with the only difference 
versus 2.6.23 being tke kernel now complaining about it, they're not useful 
enough to be printed more than once, or at more then DEBUG level or even at 
all in fact since we already know the static limit isn't enough for everyone 
and needs be turned dynamic -- really, what else is someone going to debug 
with it?
I'd consider Bjorn Helgaas the PnP maintainer and he earlier agreed that 
this needed something:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/5/301
Printing the warning only once per type as per attached fixes the problenm 
as well.
Bjorn, could you push your preference into 2.6.24?
