On USB you throw MIDI data at the device as usual just like MPU401. For CD
its different you do have to rip audio. But I thought everyone uses mp3
anyway B)
One rather tasty USB device id like to see on linux is the Roland UA-100.

Canopus also makes a USB "DA-PORT" device (sold in japan only) which
claims to be able to realtime encode mp3.
