For example, the smaller VAX computers offer 8 LEDs which show system
status during IPL. After boot finished, the OS may use them...

Is idle/timer/power hardware-controlled (eg. by a secondary processor,
direct chipset implementation) or is switching on/off controlled by
kernel (eg. heartbeat, IO and ethernet for the LEDs you can find on some
PA-RISC machines)?
