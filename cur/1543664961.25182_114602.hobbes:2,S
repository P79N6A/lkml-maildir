it has been suggested to me that the locking in skb_migrate might not be
completely correct.  any comments on the following?
        spinlock_t *first, *second;
        if ((unsigned long)from < (unsigned long) to)) {
                first = &from->lock;
                second = &to->lock;
        } else {
                first = &to->lock;
                second = &from->lock;
        }
        local_irq_save(flags);
        spin_lock(&first);
        spin_lock(&second);
i imagine this is to prevent deadlocks when you do something silly like
skb_migrate(a,b) and then skb_migrate(b,a) elsewhere.
