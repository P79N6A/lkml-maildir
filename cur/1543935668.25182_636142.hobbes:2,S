Thanks Andrew for this demonstration. At least now I know I'm not the only
one to think that. And no, I do not have any nvidia/etc. It's just that I
value their users' reports as much as the other ones just because otherwise
we would only track some elite's bugs, thus reducing the amount of information
we have to understand the circumstances under which it happens.
Cheers,
Willy
