Here the problem does show itself, but only until the first vt change
after a fresh boot.  The symptoms are slightly different in that entering
an invalid SysRq displays usage message, but anything after that just
beeps.. until a valid SysRq or vt change.  After one vt change, the bug
hides until reboot.  (k2.2.7 and cherry kbd)
