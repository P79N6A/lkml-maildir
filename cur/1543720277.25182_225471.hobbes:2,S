Well, it just works once you set it up right. And many people use it and you can get community support to a certain extent.

I definately agree that getpid() should not be cached as it gives inconsistent results.
That is why I just reported I case of "more than a handful of getpid() calls" that struck me recently.
Ok, I think I/we have no more to say about the above getpid() usage.
Is there anybody insisting on getpid() caching?
And can/will anydoby fix that in glibc?
Kalin.
