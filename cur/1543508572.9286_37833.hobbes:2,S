I agree 100%.  The new RAID is so much more useable than the old stuff.  The
old RAID works in as much as it's capable of mirroring your data.  However,
you have to be pretty Linux savvy (and pretty patient) to use it.  I feel
much more comfortable about installing the new RAID for someone else as most
things are automatic and happen in the background.
