I should have said, "Will open(2) without O_CREAT then return ENOSPC?"
This is definitely a new case.
For what it's worth, I agree with whoever (Jamie?) said that COW
should be primarily a space optimization, and that semantically the
two files should mostly behave like separate copies.
In fact, I think it is unfortunate, in some ways, that things like
permissions and timestamps are kept in the inode.  This means that two
files may only be COW-linked if they also share ownership,
permissions, and timestamps, which makes COW links less useful for
some applications (e.g., sharing source trees among multiple
developers).
But sharing data blocks without sharing inodes is too horrible even to
contemplate, I suppose.
