Yes, I know I have some speed-tuning to do.

That's odd.  I see no screen flicker at all when I scroll my menu bar.
I wonder what's different about your environment.  You're running under
SuSE, I presume -- perhaps you have an older ncurses version?

I'll document them.  They're intended to help you track what portions
of the configuration you've already done.

The SCSI support flag is in the buses menu.  You see these two menus because
the defconfig sets it on.

Ah.  That's because I didn't have an `unless ia64 suppress DISABLE_VHPT'
I've added that.
A lot of the stuff that used to be under that menu moved to archihacks,
I think.

I can't reproduce this.  Do you get the same behavior under 1.0.3?
