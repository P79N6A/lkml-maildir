Subject: any value to fixing apparent bugs in old ISDN4Linux?

$ grep -r DE_AOC .
./.config:CONFIG_DE_AOC=y
./drivers/isdn/hisax/l3dss1.c:#ifdef HISAX_DE_AOC
./drivers/isdn/hisax/l3dss1.c:#else  /* not HISAX_DE_AOC */
./drivers/isdn/hisax/l3dss1.c:#endif /* not HISAX_DE_AOC */
./drivers/isdn/hisax/Kconfig:config DE_AOC
  it seems like there's a name mismatch between the config variable
and the one that's being tested, no?
  OTOH, since that code *is* in the allegedly obsolete old ISDN4Linux
code, perhaps that entire part of the tree can just be junked.  but if
it's sticking around, it should probably be fixed.
  unless i'm misreading something up there.
