For now, this should be the final version of my root-hopping patch:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/umount-root-4.tar.gz
It's still for pre-2.3.40-6.
This version also supports lockd, and has some debugging printk
cleanup.
Unmounting the original root FS may still fail on systems that need
to run demons that aren't sharing root and cwd with the init process
(most kernel threads are) while changing the root. If the demons can
be killed later, the file system can be unmounted at this time.
Otherwise, a demon-specific solution needs to be found.
