Subject: 4.7GB DVD-RAM geometry wrong?

I don't know if I'm doing this the right way or not.  I did spend an hour
or three googling for "linux dvd-ram" and the like, and all I came up with
was a bunch of 2.2-specific stuff, until I found a usenet posting that
said in effect "you can write to /dev/scd0".  So I gave that a try
and it worked.  Sort of.
I have a Panasonic DVD-RAM, LF-D201 (SCSI 4.7/9.4GB).  I put in a
4.7GB type II cartridge (that's a single-sided disk), did 'mkfs 
/dev/scd0' and then mounted it, and ... I have a 2.2GB disk!
It works fine but my ignorant assumption is that it is using the
geometry for the older 2.2gb media.  Firing up cfdisk -z:
                                  cfdisk 2.10f
                             Disk Drive: /dev/scd0
                             Size: 2290384896 bytes
              Heads: 255   Sectors per Track: 63   Cylinders: 278
I am new to the world of DVD-RAM so I don't know off the top of my head
what the correct geometry is.  But this ain't it!
So nevermind the problems of creating partitions on the device.  Why
isn't the raw device the right size?
I'm a non-subscriber so please cc: me.
