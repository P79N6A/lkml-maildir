No offense ..... but, I did some googling and figured out where the mesg
was being printed from. So I ripped out all the unnecessary stuff from the
kernel and also stopped all the unnecessary services, but still got this
behavior (with XFCE and KDE). By the way , my desktop
started exhibiting this behaviour after  a couple of months of usage and
not immediately after a kernel upgrade (2.6.8+).  However, I remember not
seeing this behavior on older 2.6.* kernels.
The .5 second delay is a symptom rather than the cause ( bad hardware ? ).
