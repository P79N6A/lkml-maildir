Whoaa, back the truck up you just threw all those log messages in.
One of the reasons I absolutely HATED windoze was that it didn't tell you 
ANYTHING about what it was doing when booting. If it died during bootup 
you had no idea what driver was loading.
Yes, *some* of the boot messageses are excessive, but I don't know how
many times I've been able to diagnose a hardware problem or been helped by
verbose boot messages on some strange hardware I was trying to bring up, 
and the 'what was the last message printed out' has been invaluable.
