Cables don't suddenly die without the help of e. g. your CPU fan.

Drives would not write incomplete blocks.

The Western Digital 420400D (20 GB, 5400/min) and its 7200/min brother
with 18 GBs were IBM disk drives, supposedly, but the WD ...AA/BB drives
and whatever else there was looked some different from IBM drives.

Maybe. A monitor software or debug mode would be good to see when writes
are scheduled and which blocks are written (I need to ask a friend of
mine who hacked ll_rw_blk.c on a different purpose for his diploma
thesis, maybe his code is valuable to figure things out.)

I also saw that here, but again, it's basically the same hardware.
