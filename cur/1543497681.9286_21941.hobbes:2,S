First off, I booted Win98, and found that Windows was using the ES1879
driver.  Sound is perfect under Windows.  (Again, Linux recognizes it
as a ES1688.  A quick grep of the driver didn't reveal any ES1879 code
that should have been triggered.)
Now, for frequency testing...On my desktop machine (which has an
es1370), changing frequencies just changes the quality of the output
sound - tempo & pitch all sound correct, as it should.  On the VAIO,
however, there are at least two modes: a bit slow (high frequency) and
quite fast (alvin the chipmunk style, low frequency).  22050 and 44100
seem to give the slow playback mode, and 16000, 11025, 8000, and 4000
give chipmunk sounds.  I can't tell if the fast playback ones are the
same tempo, but they seem close (roughly twice as fast, I think).  I
used "tracker -frequency" and "mpg123 [-1,-2,-4]" to do these tests,
BTW.
Guess the problem is a bit more complicated...oh well!
