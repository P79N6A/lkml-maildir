That's true, it doesn't.  To get the physical address you need to walk 
pagetables as someone (either Roger or Ralf I think) pointed out.  I think 
there is code in ptrace.c that shows how this is done but it's not really 
recommended practice.
So, maybe the vmalloc idea wasn't such a good one after all and some 
completely new routine is needed.
