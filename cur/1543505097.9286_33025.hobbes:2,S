You propose to rewrite the TCP MSS option on the routers while tunneling ?

I'm not sure I follow. You worry about the possible slow down of the 
tunnel start point return ICMP messages? So you propose to turn off all
of ICMP to avoid this potential attack? This would sound like overkill
to me, and there would be still enough other ways to generate retry packets
left (e.g. with TCP). 
Also the tunnel start point has to be secured anyways, otherwise
all the encryption wouldn't make sense. Similar for the tunnel endpoint.
Or do I miss something?
