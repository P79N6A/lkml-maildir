Is it possible to have more information? Like CPU, kernel 32/64, userspace 
32/64 ...?
I've spotted something here:
+                       smp_mb();
+                       INIT_LIST_HEAD(&epi->rdllink);
The epoll callback uses list_empty() as test if to queue the item as ready, 
and list_empty() checks ->next. INIT_LIST_HEAD() sets ->next before, then 
->prev. Whoops :)
This should be:
	epi->rdllink.prev = &epi->rdllink;
	smp_mb();
	epi->rdllink.next = &epi->rdllink;
Does the problem happens with some other publicly available software that 
runs under wine, so that I can test it?
