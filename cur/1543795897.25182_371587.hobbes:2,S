Yelling!
The patch does not cause any problems but my theory about calling 
release_buffering() too early is wrong: asynchronous writes are not done 
with direct i/o. (The reason for this choice is that the API allows the 
user to do anything with the buffer between writes and so the SCSI write 
has to be finished before returning from write().)
The other fixes in the patch are valid but I don't see how they should fix 
this problem.
