for pci_alloc_consistent() which takes pci_dev as a first argument to
allocate contiguous memory block for DMA transfers. I just realized
when I saw your answer that I might have moved the memory allocation to
some routine which is called earlier in time which has access to
pci_dev pointer directly, like net_device->init IIRC. But I'm not
really sure if that would be correct solution.

Uh... it's cardbus interface and still uses pci_* stuff without problems. (?)
Do I miss something?
kind regards
