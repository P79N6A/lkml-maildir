Well I just compiled in a module for UDF file-system since somebody
said it could be UDF on the CD instead of ISO-9660. In the process
of re-booting (nothing else), the CD decided to be mountable.
This doesn't make any sense because once the M$ CD wouldn't mount
I tried other ISO-9660 CDS and they mounted fine. I do backups
using ISO-9660 with the Joliet extensions as well. Anyway, I
could read the M$ CD using `od` as well.
So, all I did was re-boot (just like Windows) and it mounted fine.
Maybe there's somebody working on Linux that used to work for
M$, so it got infected with the Windows syndrome?
Cheers,
