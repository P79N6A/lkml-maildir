*attributes* would be orthogonal to one another -- the values *within*
an attribute would be mutually exclusive.  maybe i phrased that badly
the first time.  so a feature could have both a maturity *and* a
status (just using my hypothetical attributes here), but no feature
can have an attribute with more than one value.
ergo, you can have a maturity of, say, deprecated, *and* a status of,
say, broken.  is that what you meant?  it's what i was getting at.

your point is well taken.  i'm just trying to draw a clear distinction
between what i see as the natural chronological progression of a
feature, and its actual level of functionality, which i'm firmly
convinced represent two *very* different pieces of information.
something which is marked as obsolete can still be known to be
functioning perfectly well, while something which is still bleeding
edge might be well known to be broken as well.
with regard to "experimental", what attribute would you imagine it
would be a possible value for, and what other possible values might
that attribute have as opposed to experimental?
