This is wrong. What actually causes the oops is playing two sounds
simultaneously. It doesn't happen if I send two identical mono .wav sounds
at the same time, but it does when xmms is playing a stereo mp3 and I send a
mono .wav sound.
Playing a stereo .wav and two mono wav's does not trigger this.
