great debugging!
I have reviewed that patch, and there's only one chunk that could 
possibly have a functional effect. The patch below undoes it - does that 
fix the crashes you are seeing? [If you have lockdep enabled then this 
patch will cause a lockdep false positive - ignore that one for now, it 
shouldnt impact the crash scenario itself.]

Subject: revert slab.c locking change
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Chandra Seetharaman reported SLAB crashes caused by the slab.c
lock annotation patch. There is only one chunk of that patch
that has a material effect on the slab logic - this patch
undoes that chunk.
