I'm not an expert in this area, but . . . For lilo I think the boot loader 
just records the physical address where the initrd image resides and loads it 
directly into memory thru the bios. It doesn't need to understand the device 
or filesystem -- it's just retrieving a chunk of data -- as long as the bios 
understands how to read raw (real-mode) data from the device. That would be 
why you have to rerun lilo after changing any boot files -- because the 
addresses probably changed. 
I believe grub understands filesystems but I've also had trouble using grub to 
boot from devices which need module loading, i.e. USB flash drives. I don't 
use grub much though.
