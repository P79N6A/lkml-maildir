Accounting PAGE_SIZE for a present pte or swap entry preserves the
same latency allowance as Ingo made when he introduced ZAP_BLOCK_SIZE,
so it assures us of no regression on those.
I've always felt a pte_none entry probably ought to count for more than
1 on that scale, perhaps 16.  But likewise never did any calculation or
research, nor heard of any complaints - and large stretches of pte_none
should be quite a common case, after your copy_page_range optimization.
Plus we've both regarded that code as just for the interim, while both
of us (I see today) pursue preemptible mmu_gather solutions (I'll look
at your patch and report, but not today).
