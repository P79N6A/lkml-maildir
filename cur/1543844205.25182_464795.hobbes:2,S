So far I have not been able to find the hooks to the VM. The sharing 
would also work with nodes. Just create a couple of nodes with the sizes you 
want and then put the node with the shared memory into the cpusets for the 
apps sharing them.

Hmmm... That gets into issues of knowing how many pages are in use by an 
application and that is fundamentally difficult to do due to pages being 
shared between processes.

I'd really be interested to have proper tracking of memory use for 
processes but I am not sure what use the containers would be there.
