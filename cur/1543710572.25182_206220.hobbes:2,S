Actually, I just meant changing:
-obj-$(CONFIG_X86_SMP)		+= smp.o smpboot.o trampoline.o
+obj-$(CONFIG_X86_SMP)		+= smp.o smpboot.o
+obj-$(CONFIG_SMP)		+= trampoline.o
... which is more like what the original code is doing, minus VISWS.

Nope.  It shouldn't be using the boot page tables after paging_init, and 
even so, the "new" boot page tables look just like the "old" ones except 
there might be more of them, so there are two resaons that shouldn't be 
happening.  I'd have been less surprised if you'd seen a problem with 
boot_ioremap(), although even that shouldn't really be different...
My main guess would be a porting problem (_end -> init_pg_tables_end) in 
discontig.c, which I believe Voyager uses, right?
I don't have access to any real subarchitectures (I have a visws now, 
but I haven't actually been able to run it yet), so the discontig stuff 
didn't get tested; on the other hand the change in there was quite trivial.
Sorry for not being able to be more helpful, but I'm surrounded by boxes 
and this is the last weekend I have to pack before I move houses...
