All of which is an AGP design bug, if you want performance you don't
cripple your caches, but we have to live with it so no use tilting at
windmills.

I've heard of several and dealt with one.  The problem was essentially they
ran out of mtrrs, the edges of free memory were to rough.

There are not enough MTRRs.  And using the PAT bits to say memory is
write-back can be a constant.  It just takes a little work to get in
place.  Plus the weird assortment of consistency issues.
For most purposes PAT makes memory easier to deal with because you
can be as fine grained as you like.  The difficulty is that you must
have consistent attributes across all of your virtual mappings.  
The other case PAT should help is when a machine has multiple cards
that can benefit from write-combining.  Currently running out of mtrrs
is a problem.
