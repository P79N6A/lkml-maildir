OK, so do it in the C library, or write a wrapper for unlink(3) and
use LD_PRELOAD and override that way. That just leaves old statically
linked binaries. I don't consider this feature to be sufficiently
critical such that old static binaries need it.
You can overwrite an existing file. The same inode is used.
