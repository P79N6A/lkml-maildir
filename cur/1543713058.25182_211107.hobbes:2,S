Hi,
in 2.6.5-rc3 was incorporated a fix for SiS648 chipsets that need a little 
time to get into a sane state again, after switching to AGP 8x.
The 746FX has the same timing problem and needs this 'pause', too.
Unfortunatly in sis-apg.c this fix is only checked against the 648, not the 
746, so the fix never gets invoked:
    		if(device->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_SI_648) {
			// weird: on 648 and 648fx chipsets any rate change in the target command 
register
			// triggers a 5ms screwup during which the master cannot be configured
			printk(KERN_INFO PFX "sis 648 agp fix - giving bridge time to recover\n");
			set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
			schedule_timeout (1+(HZ*10)/1000);
Glück Auf,
Volker
