hello all,
i tried to made a program in the form of a module. This program would attempt to read/poll status register of IDE until the value for the status register is 0x50. 
here is the algorithm:
 save_flag();
 disable_interrupt();
 poll_or_read_or_get_input_from_IDE_status_register();
 enable_interrupt();
 restore_flags();
 this program would run fine, but after the program is finished executing, it would display a message:
 ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_lostirq func only: 13
 hdc: lost interrupt
the OS doesn't hang. because normal operation would resume after this program exit.
 OS=linux 7.3, kernel=2.4.18-3
my question is:
how can i solve this error such that the error message would not appear anymore?
i have lots of other questions, but that of the above is the most important..
hope to hear your reply,
-Ana
