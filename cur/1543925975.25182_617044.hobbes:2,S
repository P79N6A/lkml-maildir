Same thing can be said for compile breakages as well.  Looking at the
latest kautobuild output:
ARM ep93xx defconfig has been broken since 2.6.23-git1 due to:
drivers/net/arm/ep93xx_eth.c:420: error: implicit declaration of function '__netif_rx_schedule_prep'
caused by: [NET]: Make NAPI polling independent of struct net_device objects.
ARM netx defconfig has been broken since 2.6.23-git1 due to:
drivers/net/netx-eth.c: In function 'netx_eth_hard_start_xmit':
drivers/net/netx-eth.c:131: error: 'dev' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/net/netx-eth.c:131: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/net/netx-eth.c:131: error: for each function it appears in.)
drivers/net/netx-eth.c: In function 'netx_eth_receive':
drivers/net/netx-eth.c:158: error: 'dev' undeclared (first use in this function)
caused by: [NET] drivers/net: statistics cleanup #1 -- save memory and shrink code
Haven't got a report for either of those, but Kautobuild lets people
know if folk can be bothered to subscribe to its mailing list and/or
look at the site occasionally.
I suspect the maintainers of the above drivers aren't aware that their
drivers are broken.
