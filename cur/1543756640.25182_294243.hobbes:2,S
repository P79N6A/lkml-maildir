This sounds the best way to go. btw, is this a different codebase from
the one that Toshihiro is testing?

Indeed. It's very similar to locked pages. All pages can be pinned for a
transient amount of time, either in the pte or with
PG_pinned/PG_writeback (now perhaps Hugh found a way to drop the pin on
the pte [I'm still unconvinced about that], but sure you're left with
transient pinning with PG_locked or PG_writeback).

If there are persistent usages PG_capture sounds a good idea. Perhaps
the whole point that Toshihiro has problem with is that there are really
persistent users that require PG_capture? He mentioned direct IO, that's
not a long time, if something core dump could be a long time.
