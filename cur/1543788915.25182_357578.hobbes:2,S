That's because it's not a blob ;)
You can do
	git-cat-file -t dd0fc66
and it will tell you it's a "commit" object. Then do
	git-cat-file commit dd0fc66
and it will show the actual commit internals, including commit info, 
parents and what tree object that commit is associated with.
HOWEVER. What you actually want to see is probably
	git-diff-tree -p --pretty dd0fc66
which shows the commit as "patch" (-p) and a "pretty header" (--pretty).
