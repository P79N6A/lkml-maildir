(1) Deadlock
A few hours ago I wrote:

Now that I mentioned that inserting usb-storage hangs forever
and then causes a SCSI oops, the question arises how the hang
is caused. It turns out to be a semaphore deadlock.
What happens is that base/bus.c:bus_add_driver() downs
        down_write(&bus->subsys.rwsem);
and then later usb/core/hub.c:usb_reset_device() downs
        down_read(&gdev->bus->subsys.rwsem);
This is the same semaphore, and we have a deadlock.

(2) Mailer error
but vger didnt like this letter (?) and confusingly answered

The following addresses had permanent fatal errors
<linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
... while talking to vger.kernel.org.:
>>> MAIL From:<aeb@hera.cwi.nl.> SIZE=463
<<< 501-5.1.7 For input: <aeb@hera.cwi.nl.> SIZE=463
<<< 501 5.1.7 Path data: Spurious dot (.) at the end of the domain name
501 <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>... Data format error
<aeb@smtp.cwi.nl>... Deferred: Connection refused by hera.cwi.nl.
