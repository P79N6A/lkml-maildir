yes, for the normal filesystem it's reasonable - procfs and driverfs
are a different thing. (if you want everyone just to read the value,
you mean everyone - even root)
procfs _does_ implement a check for that, it's only driverfs which doesn't
(for now) ... and i just wanted to know if there's a reason for that.

it is gone already. (try to change /proc/version ;), also the capabilities
are there to not allow _everything_ for root (but that's not neccesarily an
fs issue)
