I agree that is the fair and nice thing to do, but I was talking about reserving
memory for device vs sharing it with a user process, user processes can wait,
their pages can even be swapped out if needed. But for a device that is not willing
to wait (GFP_ATOMIC) say in an interrupt context, this might be a issue.
Anyway, how do you plan to solve this ?
