Ok, just looked at the definition of on_each_cpu() and I can see that it 
is disabling/enabling preemption explicitly, so there are no problems.
I assumed that on_each_cpu() is just a new 2.6 name for the old 
smp_call_function(), that is why I thought there may be problems with 
preemption. Thanks for clarifying this.
Kind regards
