This is probably because ...
> [ 3804.140000] /build/buildd/linux-source-2.6.22-2.6.22/drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: USB Serial support registered for pl2303
... the card is in fact recognized by the pl2303 driver instead of the
Option driver. This driver may do something stupid.
Please try this (as root):
# rmmod plc2303
# modprobe option
If the card still does not work, type
# lsusb
and send me that.
