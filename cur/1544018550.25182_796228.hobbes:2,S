Yes - I've pushed it up to 4096 now.  Should be plenty!
I guess Postfix is a bit of an odd case here.   It runs lots of processes, yet
uses epoll within many of them as well - sort of a historical design in some ways,
but also to enforce maximum privilege separation with many of the daemons able to
be run under chroot with limited capabilities.
So I guess I have a few questions left:
1) is this value ever supposed to be hit in practice by non-malicious software?
   If not, it appears 128 is too low.
2) if we're going to stick with 128, is there any way to query the kernel as to how
   close to the limit it's getting?  As an example, our system checks poll
   /proc/sys/fs/file-max every 2 minutes, and warn us if its getting "full".
I was paged a couple of nights ago because we has file-nr set at 300000, which
used to be plenty, but we had a drive failure in another machine, and moved all
our Cyrus masters off while the RAID rebuilt.  Suddenly there were heaps more
processes.  We had set the limit insanely high (page when only 5000 left), but
I managed to wake up and log in within about 4 minutes, and there were still 256
left when I shoved it up higher.
Obviously I've tuned it to be warned earlier now.  But anyway - it's possible.
I can't see any easy way to be aware when, say, 110 epolls have been used by the
same user, so I can fix the limit before it starts throttling incoming connections!
3) do you want me to write up a patch to add an epoll-max or similar procfile that
   can be queried for this value?
Bron ( the basic rule here is - if something has woken you up by failing, a test
       goes into the automated systems so you get advance warning next time )
