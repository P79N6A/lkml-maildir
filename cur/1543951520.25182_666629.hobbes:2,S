Thank you for explanation. Maybe I understood the summary of
implementation of HP firmware. But how to use or where to put _INI
method in the ACPI namespace never becomes reasonable reason why
your driver may ignore _STA before evaluating _SUN.

My understanding of your explanation so far is:
- evaluating _SUN without checking _STA doesn't cause problem,
  from the view point of HP's implementation.
- some IBM machine is doing same as HP
I never think those are reasonable reasons why ignoring _STA
before evaluating _SUN is legal. Am I missing something?

I don't want to consider "majority rule" before I understand why
ignoring _STA is legal.
Thanks,
