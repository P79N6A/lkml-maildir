I tried using:
2.4.18-3smp (red hat 7.3) with options: hdc=ide-scsi
and using ext3 fs.
2.4.18-5custom (red hat 7.3 recompiled with smp, bigmem and ext3 fs) with 
options: hdc=ide-scsi
2.4.18-5smp (red hat 7.3 upgrade of bigmem header problem and ext3 fs problem) 
with options: hdc=ide-scsi
2.4.18-3 (red hat 7.3 uniprocessor for get up) with options:
hdc=ide-scsi noprobe mem=256m
details about the last:  
    When changing mem parameter value to 64 or 512 or 128 its stop in 
different places (using the "printk debbug technic") in io_apic.c/apic.c 
parts.
After that I tried the kernel from kernel.org and got the following message:
-----------^^^cut here^^^------------

Its a error? Should a try the last last kernel patchs?
I'm not thinking about a hadware problem, cause BIOS detect
2 CPUS and Linux agree with this. Am I wrong?

Ricardo.
