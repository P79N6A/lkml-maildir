Thanks. I think we can actually do it even simpler -- just check if any
of the relevant bits in pending are set, and schedule the tasklet if
they are.
Now, I suspect the locking is currently broken -- we need to guard
against updates to read_status_mask and ignore_status_mask, but I think
we can get away with only adding some locking to the tasklet, not the
interrupt handler.
Hrm. We probably need to lock while updating icount. That's a problem
since we do that from the tx interrupt handler...and I don't suppose we
want to move most of the atmel_tx_chars() code into the tasklet too...?
