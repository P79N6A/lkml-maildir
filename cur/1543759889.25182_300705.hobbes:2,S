Did you include support for the new key/keyring infrastructure 
introduced
a couple versions ago by David Howells?  It allows userspace to create 
and
manage various sorts of "keys" in kernelspace.  If you create and 
register
a few keytypes for various symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, you could 
then
take advantage of its support for securely passing keys around in and 
out
of userspace.
