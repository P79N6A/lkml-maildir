Subject: IBM tokenring card and hangs on network problems

I'm using a IBM TR Card (old 8-bit).
Sometimes the driver just hangs and won't do anything any more - no rmmod,
no ifconfig, packet's don't travel ... rest of system works fine (as far as
possible without networking).
one kind of problem I could reproduce today: 
I had to pull the network cable (some kind of network error, isn't it?) and
put it back a few seconds later (another socket).
ifconfig showed then an hw-adress of xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx (ok so far) and then
10x 00!!!!
in ibmtr.c up to 24 (0x18) /2  -> 12 bytes are read from the card, whereas
netdevice.h defines MAX_ADDR_LEN as 7.
I'm not absolutly sure about my analysis, but I think I found a possible
cause for troubles.
Could please someone who knows better than me what's going on in there have
a look?
thx & regards
Ph.
Note to Paul Norton: I wrote to you because you're the last one listed in
ibmtr.c in about the troubled part. Excuse me if I've caused any
inconvinience.
