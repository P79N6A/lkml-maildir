You were also copied on the patch when it was added to my tree.  Email
was sent to your rweikusat@sncag.com address.

Which is the better way to document exactly how you are walking through
all of the endpoints.

3 places?  You mean in the if call?

This really isn't a problem.

Again, this is the better way to walk through all of the endpoints for a
device.

This is initialization code, it's better to be obvious as to what you
are trying to do here than trying to do the compiler's job for it.
Especially as it is not a critical path by any means.

There were some statements that had more than one on one line (I think
in a few usages of 'if'), but as I don't have the original patch handy,
I'll defer.
The _main_ coding style difference is that it was not obvious as to what
you were doing while walking the list of endpoints in the device.  That
is why I changed the code, to be more obvious to who ever looks at the
code next (most likely me in about 2 years...)

Please work to see what is wrong with the existing patch.  Is there
anything that I can do to help you out?
