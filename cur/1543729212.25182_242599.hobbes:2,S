I'm thinking of adding a SCHED_IA scheduler class to the ZAPHOD CPU 
scheduler.  Tasks in this class would automatically get maximum 
interactive bonuses without having to go through ZAPHOD's normal 
mechanism for identifying interactive processes.  The main reason for 
doing this is that it is difficult to make rules for detecting 
interactive tasks that will successfully class the X server as 
interactive (which is necessary) but at the same time not also so 
classify tasks that aren't interactive.  This is because from time to 
time the X server's CPU usage rate gets very and also (as it serves 
multiple clients) its usage patterns aren't typical of most interactive 
tasks (i.e. lots of irregular sleep waiting for user input).
To make SCHED_IA useful, I would also make a PAGG client that would 
automatically set the scheduler classes of tasks to SCHED_IA if they 
exec() a binary designated by the sysadmin as an interactive program.
