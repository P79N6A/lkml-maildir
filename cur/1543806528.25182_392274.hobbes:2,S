Here's one that removes xcount.  It seems to work too.
Should we set hwif->rqsize to 256, or are we pretty safe in
expecting that the default won't rise?  The driver should be
able to handle more, but this ioc4 hardware is weird, and it
probably wouldn't get tested if a general change were made :-)
