Your report is actually helpful, not so much to Rik, though. According
to Kai Germaschewski (Subject: Re: piggy broken in 2.5.24 build, Date:
Sat, 22 Jun 2002), "For the current kbuild, you should never need to do
make mrproper, it  should always recognize changes and rebuild what's
necessary."
Well, what's the problem, Kai?
