write_oldmem_page is kept to be consistent with copy_oldmem_page as much
as possible. The userbuf is used by copy_oldmem_page too, and
write_oldmem_page is in the same file as copy_oldmem_page. I think the
consistence between them is reasonable.
And the copy_oldmem_page/write_oldmem_page is considered to be
architecture dependent. Now, there are different implementations for
copy_oldmem_page on different architectures. So I think the
copy_oldmem_page/write_oldmem_page should be kept in separate file
instead of go mem.c.
