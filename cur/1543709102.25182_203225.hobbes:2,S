Don't know about the latest version(s), but with 2.4.25, compiling
with -Wshadow brings up a lot of potential problems. One can
turn off (temporarily) the built in functions to get rid of the
spurious warnings about memcpy(), etc., then you see that too many
variables to mention here are shadowed (probably thousands). Some
of them may be hazardous because they are spin-lock variables and
semaphores. There are also some shadowed functions. NotGood(tm)!
Cheers,
