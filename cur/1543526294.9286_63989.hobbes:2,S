BTW I really like devfs, but the new names for mass storage are even uglier then
the old ones ...
It really sucks to type "mkfs.ext /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1".
I'd prefer something like:
/dev/dsk/at0d0a
      |  |  | |
      |  |  | | BSD-like character for partition [a=1, b=2, ...]
      |  |  | d<devicenum (scsi-id for scsi, 0 for ide master, 1 for ide slave, ...)>
      |  | an two-character-prefix for the device-type (at for ata/ide, sc for scsi) and the bus number
      | directory /dev/dsk/ for all disks
I it is needed (and only _if_) there could be lX for lun x between dX and <partiotion character> like:
/dev/dsk/sc0d5l2a.
This would be much more readable (and typeable) without lose of functionality.
