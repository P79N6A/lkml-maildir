Sorry to say but it is just not that way. Window manager is for managing windows
and it shouldn't depend on any audio system. It should use an external app using exec call
to play sounds (aplay, sox, wavplay etc.) configured by some config option.
Generally it is a big mess in may distros where desktop apps depends on sound.
Yes, it is nice to have sound but it is not absolutly needed to use an editor for example.

If you are the author then I just suggest to use exec(3) call, for example:
if (!fork()){
	execvp("aplay","beep.wav");
	exit(0);
}
Simple, and you don't need to know anything about sound programming ;-).
