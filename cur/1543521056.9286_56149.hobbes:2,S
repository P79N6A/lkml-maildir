Yes, it is the line
#define RLIM_INFINITY   (~0UL)
in /usr/src/linux/include/asm/resource.h
Because of that line, the comiler complains about redefinition in
/usr/include/bits/resource.h:
/usr/include/bits/resource.h:111: warning: `RLIM_INFINITY' redefined
/usr/include/asm/resource.h:25: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
This confuses the configure script for bash.
I would recommend the following patch:
--- /usr/include/bits/resource.h.orig	Sat Nov  6 17:23:45 1999
+++ /usr/include/bits/resource.h	Thu Jan  6 22:26:32 2000

 #ifdef __USE_LARGEFILE64
Then reconfigure and make.
