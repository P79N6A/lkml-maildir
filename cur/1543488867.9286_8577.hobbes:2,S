Hold on, there! I've never said I wanted to drop the old names: they
will be supported for compatibility. It's one thing for me to provide
a new naming scheme which I think is better, but it's another thing to
remove support for the old names. That's not my decision: it's up to
the community.
Also: devfs is less about names than it is about scalability and
management issues. The names are secondary.
