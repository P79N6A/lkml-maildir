    the 35 other filesystems out there in the standard sources, never
    mind others that haven't been integrated (XFS, ext3 etc..).
Hmm... what about dropping block device per se' and creating a
pseudo-fs (say /dev/blk/) that gives a page-cache view of the
underlying raw devices?
That way older filesystems and tools could use that view of things
until they are moved into the page-cache, and those people without
the dependence of those filesystems can complete forgo all of this?
