The biggest you can go to currently is -O3, I believe. Anything beyond that
turns on the same flags.

From the gcc manual:
`-fomit-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
     don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
     restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
     in many functions.  *It also makes debugging impossible on some
     machines.*
This option is never turned on by default (on i386), so the kernel Makefile
turns it on.
Obviously, it should improve run-time performance, unless the gcc code
optimizer is so buggy that it generates faster code with less registers
available ;)
