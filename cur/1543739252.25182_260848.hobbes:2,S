This was the explanation I got some time ago

So "used" cases that used "unused" could break, though older compilers
in essence used "unused" to mean both "used" and "unused".  Since
"unused" becomes useless for using in "used" cases, we now must be sure
to use "used" when that's the use that's useful.
