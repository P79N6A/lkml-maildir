Have found the reason for the task to become unkillable, i.e. state 'D'.
There is a bug in 2.6.9 and up in fs/exec.c
If the kernel does coredump_wait(), it tries to kill all other threads, that are
running on the same mm. Therefore it calls "force_sig_specific(SIGKILL, p)".
But if one of the threads is on a ptrace-stop, SIGKILL has no effect.
The killing thread will wait forever in "D".
