It isn't a new one as such. It would simply make explicit the fact
that this code really can't handle allocation failures, and it is
presently depending on the allocator implementation to work.

Yes. But we shouldn't partially fail and leave the machine crippled.
Hence, __GFP_NOFAIL as a good marker for someone who gets keen and
comes along to fix it up properly. If it were trivial to fix it, I
wouldn't suggest adding the __GFP_NOFAIL.
