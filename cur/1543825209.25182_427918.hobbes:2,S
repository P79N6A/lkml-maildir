You missed PowerPC and a few others... :P
I get the point, but we all know that many people getting into Linux
from some other background often are using PC based platforms. It's
not worth ignoring that just because Linux supports many alternatives
and we personally use them. I personally use my Powerbooks for much of
my day-to-day Linux, but I'm weird anyway.

No point bothering, just do an x86 one and someone will do a variant!
:P Then they'll end up starting an entire community and figuring out
which platforms should be first class citizens for support. Before
Greg even realizes it, he'll have started a whole new Linux
distribution all by releasing a DDK. No I'm not being serious.
Jon.
