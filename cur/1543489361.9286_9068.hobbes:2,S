Vladmir is proposing having the kernel rearrange the bytes manually, rather
than relying on hardware support.  This wouldn't work for two reasons:
- sharing wouldn't work with mappings of different endianness
- the kernel can't do the required reversal, since it depends on the type of
the data, but the kernel only sees raw bytes.
If the hardware has per-page endianness settings then neither of these apply.
