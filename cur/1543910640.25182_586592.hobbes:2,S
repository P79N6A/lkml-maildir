wait.... we HAVE that infrastructure .. see kernel/latency.c ...

and kernel/latency.c was designed EXACTLY for that reason. All the USB
layer has to do is to announce it's latency requirement like this:
/* 
 * Some broadcom chips are buggy and can't take more than 5 usec as DMA
 * latency; inform the rest of kernel of this.
 */
if (weird_broadcom_chip())
	set_acceptable_latency("ehci", 5);
and the C-state code will honor it. CPUFREQ doesn't honor it yet but
that's easy to add.. (this assumes the ACPI BIOS informs us correctly
about the cpu behavior, but that's the best we can do obviously unless
you want a table inside the kernel keyed off vendor/model/stepping)
