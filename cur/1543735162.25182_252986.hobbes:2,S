It's always interesting trying to remember your logic for doing
something after the fact :>. If I recall correctly, it goes like this:
Writing two pagesets forces me to account for memory usage much more
carefully. I need to ensure before I start to write the image that I
know exactly what the size is and have allocated enough memory to do the
write. If I get some driver coming along and grabbing memory for who
knows what (hotplug, anyone? :>), I may get stuck halfway through
writing the image with no memory to use. I also have to be paranoid
about how much memory is available because I save that too (some of it
may have become slab by the time I do the atomic copy).
Regards,
Nigel
