arch/i386/config.in is where the processor characteristics CONFIG_X86_...
are derived from processor type.  There's only one difference between
the CONFIG_MPENTIUMIII configs and the CONFIG_MPENTIUM4 configs (in
2.4.18 or 2.4.19 or 2.4.20-pre4): CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT 5 or 7.
Alan, that reminds me: 2.4.20-ac sets CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT 7
when CONFIG_MPENTIUMIII: looks wrong, but perhaps there's a reason?
