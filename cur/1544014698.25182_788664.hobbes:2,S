While it may seem old fashioned the good old suid wrapper
is still working well for such things. That assumes you don't
want to do that in the middle of a process execution,
but that seems like a reasonable restriction.

Hmm, I suppose RLIMIT_* does not qualify then.

That's difficult, for example are you going to disallow fork/exec?
If no then the process might still exploit something suid.
Also typically such sandbox schemes want to restrict more system
calls (basically using a white list), just in case to protect against unknown 
kernel holes in the more complex ones.

It would be probably better if you had a few concrete use cases too
(so not just what, but also why) 
Anyways, it all sounds like more like it should be done as a special
case in a more general sandbox framework to me. Linux already
has several ones (e.g. selinux, secure computing, AA out of tree). Perhaps one
of them could be adapted to your needs.

In Linux, at least traditional BSD semantics ignore file system
access checks on Unix sockets.

There are more IPC mechanisms around too, e.g. sysv message passing
or queued signals with payload.  You probably need to consider
all of those.
