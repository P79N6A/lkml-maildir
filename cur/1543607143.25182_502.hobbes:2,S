I'd very much like this one to be two pass, with the second pass occuring
after interrupts are disabled. There are some horrible cases to try and
handle otherwise (like devices that like to jam the irq line high).
Ditto on return from suspend where some devices also like to float the irq
high as you take them over (eg USB on my Palmax). From comments Ben made
ages back I believe ppc has similar issues if not worse
