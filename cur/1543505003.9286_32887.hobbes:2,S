You're absolutely correct.  I thought I had check all my firewall
stuff thoroughly, but I overlooked the autofw rules I had added a
couple months back to handle Jedi Knight.  As a hack to get it
working correctly, I had removed the control port, so that all TCP
ports in the range 2300-2400 were affected without qualification.  I
commented these back out (as they should have been all the time) and
things are back to normal.
Thanks!
