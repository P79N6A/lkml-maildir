Hi all,
Iam using SiS900  chipset .It contains sis900 Fast ethernetcard . I installed
RedHat Linux 6.2 .But I could not configure net card.
I want to know Does kernel 2.2.15 supports sis900 net card or not. ?.
Iam trying to insert sis900 as module .But Iam getting message as "
"Device or Resource busy ".
