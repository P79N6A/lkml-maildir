That still breaks POSIX, right? Hopefully it will not break any apps,

The scenario where it does not seem superior is "I have system with AA
here and I'd like to keep using it".

There still is "it does not work with long pathnames".
Plus IIRC we have something like "AA has to allocate path-sized
buffers along every syscall".
I guess Al Viro or Christoph Hellwig would be able to detail on
