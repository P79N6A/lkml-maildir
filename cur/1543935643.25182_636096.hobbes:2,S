An alternative might be to come up with something decent and target 2.6.24.x

We put the crappy code back in for 2.6.24 then take it out immediately
after 2.6.24 and put something else in to support mmiotrace and perhaps the
other new mystery features to which you refer below.  hm.

That change has been in the mainline tree for nearly three months.  All
these affected parties have left it until the eve of 2.6.24 to actually
tell us about it.  This is causing me sympathy problems :(
