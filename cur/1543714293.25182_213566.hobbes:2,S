Well, the only major function behind user_walk is path_lookup.
This one has some calls with the nameidata.Other process seems
current->fs->xxx relevant read-only.Maybe you mean the
read_lock(&current->fs->lock) which could bring a deadlock as we
task->lock before ? 
If user_walk had to run in ruid, why would we have permission() then ?
