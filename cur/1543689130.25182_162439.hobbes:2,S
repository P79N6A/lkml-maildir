Subject says all! :-)
2.6.0-test3-mm2 still works (as does 2.4.21-rc2).
vanilla 2.6.0-test4 & test4-mm[45] & the onboard ethernet doesn't seem to work.
No kernel panics, it just doesn't work :-(
Both have same ethernet driver:

eth0: VIA VT6102 Rhine-II at 0xe800, 00:40:63:ca:6a:c1, IRQ 10.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 1, status 0x786d advertising 05e1 Link 45e1.
eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII #1 link partner capability of 45e1.
Even manual config (normal is dhcp) doesn't work.
Haven't seen anyone else report this, but this is repeatable and i suspect
more people must have experienced this ?!
Machine is running debian-unstable distro.

I think so Brain, but why does a forklift 
have to be so big if all it does is lift forks?
