Herbert, good catch!
David, if it's not too late I think more credits are needed,
especially for Willy. He did "a bit" more than testing.
Alas, I can't see this problem with skb->head longer than page. There
is even some comment on this in __splice_segment(), but I can miss
something.
I'm more concerned with memory usage if these skbs are not acked for
some reason. Isn't there some DOS issue possible?
Thanks everybody,
Jarek P.
