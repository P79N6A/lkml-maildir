First, there is *NOT* any requirement in the GPL at all that requires 
making compilers available. Otherwise it would not be possible, for 
instance, have a Visual Basic GPL'd application. And yes, it is possible.
Second, up until the present day I have personal experience with 
hardware producers that do not have enough money to buy expensive 
toolchains and used a lot of hand-work to code hardware parameters. So, 
at least for them, hand-hexcoding-days are still going.
