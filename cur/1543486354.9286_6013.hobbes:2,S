If you'd been reading l-k, you would have seen several threads refering

ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/sard-0.3.tar.gz
provides disk % busy, average queue, CPU wait times, throughput and
number of IOs per second read/write for each disk and each partition.
I hope to fold these into the main kernel at some point.
