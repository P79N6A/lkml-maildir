Given that list drivers are separate from the MTA (and that's good),
it's less trivial than simple looking at message headers or DNS info
that the MTA shuffles around anyways. The MTA doesn't need the
subscription list however, since "exploding" the subscriber list is a
separate problem handled by Majordomo, Mailman, Sympa, whatever.
