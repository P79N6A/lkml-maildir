Try doing the following in SCSI
-	Device managed storage layout  "Allocate x blocks close to 	handle y
and give me a new handle"
-	Per I/O request readahead hints (please read on xyzK , please 	dont
readahead)
-	Per I/O request writeback hints (write back cache is ok, write 	back
cache is ok only if NV, don't bother caching, streaming I/O
	hint)
Nor are all the FC problems caused by bad transport implementations in
Linux. Physical layer incompatibilities occur everywhere - but aren't
the one I'm talking about. Of more concern are the inability to manage
multiple levels of caches properly.
I have controllers which can do most of the above. I don't want to talk
scsi to them and spend all my cpu time faking, decoding and recoding
command blocks, spoofing error handling and the like.
Its simply inappropriate to consider the SCSI command set as a high
level interface for block and related I/O. 
As to your comments on sg. Everyone except you happened to think that
Doug Gilberts very nice sg changes were the right path. I still think it
was the right decision.

The Linux development process aggressively filters bad ideas.
