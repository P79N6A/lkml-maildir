I suspect what you're seeing is the random nature of threads to bind either to 
a hyperthread sibling or a real core. If all your threads land on only one 
physical cpu and both hyperthread siblings it will run much slower than if 
half land on one physical cpu and half on the other physical cpu. To confirm 
this, try setting cpu affinity just for one logical core of each phyiscal cpu 
(like affinity for cpu 1 and 3 only for example) or disabling hyperthread in 
the bios.
Cheers,
