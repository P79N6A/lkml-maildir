I had started a similar thread last week:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0109.1/0198.html
There is clearly something wrong with the sis ide driver.  I've lost years
of information due to backups also being corrupt.  I'll hopefully be
testing a patch in the next day or two from Andre.
Reading your previous posts, I'd still have to agree with Alan that
have something else going wrong.  I've had similar problems where things
have worked in windows, but then not even being able to install Linux.
The results problems have ended up being bad ram and inadequate cooling.
