That's why I proposed using multi-stream files. With a syscall like
fd2 = open_substream(fd, "somename")
you could have several control streams and also be prepared if you want to 
support multi-stream filesystems like NTFS in the future...
BTW: how does this work in NT? Do you first open a file and then fork it like 
in my example,  do they have a special open for substreams or is the 
substream always encoded in the filename?
