Yes, but... :)  If we wait until the 2.4.x branch, our opportunity to "soak" this
relatively major change without production impact will have passed us by.  The last thing
I want to do is add performance that impacts stability in, or too close to, a "stable"
kernel series.  I'd like to get a few weeks or more of time with this change.  I'm doing
it myself in all my kernels, but I know that I'm not running anywhere near the expanse of
programs and stresses on the different types of systems that the Linux community is.

Jay or Richard would be the best ones to ask, not me (yet (unfortunately) ;).

Kewl.  I'm hoping that we can move as many of the well-liked tools that are Intel-only
over to Alpha.  I've started one, you're starting another, and someone else is doing the
LKCD, IIRC.  The snowball is growing :)
