Ahh, I think the issue is that we have to walk the page tables to drop
the reference count of the _actual pages_ they point to. The page
tables themselves could all be put on a list or two lists (one for
PMDs, one for everything else), but that wouldn't really be a win over
just walking the tree, especially given the extra list maintenance.
Because the fan-out is large, the bulk of the work is bringing the last
layer of the tree into cache to find all the pages in the address
space. And there's really no way around that.
