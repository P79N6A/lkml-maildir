It does, but CPU controller is not so simple as memory one.

IMHO such unification may only imply that one syscall is used to pass
configuration info into kernel.
Each controller has specific configurating parameters different from the
other ones. E.g. CPU controller must assign a "weight" to each group to
share CPU time accordingly, but what is a "weight" for memory controller?
IO may operate on "bandwidth" and it's not clear what is a "bandwidth" in
Kb/sec for CPU controller and so on.

Do you mean that page must be re-charged each time someone touches it?
