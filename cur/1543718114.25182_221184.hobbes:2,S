Err.. yeah, I'm not quite sure why but a make oldconfig on my 2.6.5 config did not enable apic.
Rather than boot 2.6.5 noapic, I enabled apic on 2.6.6 and the dmesg compares perfectly to the 2.6.5 
one, right up until it tries to probe the 9th disk where it proceeds to dma timeout and then cease 
to listen to anything..
