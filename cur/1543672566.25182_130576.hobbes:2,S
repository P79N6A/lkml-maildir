Nope. Just don't steal thousands of CPU cycles to make something
"pretty". Obviously something called recursively with a 2k buffer
on the stack is going to break. However one has to actually
look at the code and determine the best (if any) way to reduce
stack usage. For instance, some persons may just "like" 0x400 for
the size of a temporary buffer when, in fact, 29 bytes are actually
used.
FYI, one can make a module that will show the maximum amount
of stack ever used IFF the stack gets zeroed before use upon
kernel startup. Would this be useful or has it already been
done?
Cheers,
