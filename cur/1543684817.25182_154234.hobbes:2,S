   Answer is "No".
   I'm running expensive workstation - and I'm _NOT_ using 
LSM/IPSec/IPv6. I do not care what I _*can*_ do - I care about what I 
_*need*_ to do.
   Point is here that 3k of code is all what we need. Not 'what every 
one does need', not Linux kernel.
P.S.
   printk() is absolutely renundant since there is no display at all ;-)
   And can you imagine Linux without printk, bug_on & panic?-)))
