Take a look at this:
	
http://www-s.ti.com/sc/psheets/spra096a/spra096a.pdf
It describes an algorithm, plus test results.  It was tested on a TI
DSP using those very Bellcore tapes, plus another set of tests, and
passes both tests very well.
Of course your ISDN hardware + phone handset may have much worse
analogue circuitry, but I would hope the Bellcore tapes represent that
to some degree.
Unfortunately, TI have removed the version of their application node
which includes DSP source code.  It can be found here instead:

I guess if that _exact_ DSP algorithm were recoded in C, you could be
reasonably confident that the C implementation would pass those
Bellcore and MITEL tests with reasonable analogue hardware.  That's
probably the best you can do on the digital side.
enjoy,
