So what do you think is proper behavior in situation when 
CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK=N on 64bit kernel, and 32bit-binary is loaded in 32bit 
emulation?
We can either leave the brk as-is, but that is in contradiction to user 
explictly specifying CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK=N. Is this what you propose?
Or we can randomize brk start in such situation, but that is the behavior 
we currently automatically have due to CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK=N, so no change 
is needed.
