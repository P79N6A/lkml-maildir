Hi,
I understand why this happens.
Your sound card has a single "headphone" output, and since it is single, it is called "Master"
the stac you have also has a real master volume control, that controls all the DACs, not just the headphones.
I added support for it, thus two controls collided.
The  following patch will rename the "Master" output to "Headphone"
Note that on the stac 9205/9204, the only one that has no master volume (the volume knob)
but has a "Master Volume" amplifier widget, this will probably rename the "Master Volume" to
Headphones.
This chip is quite different, thus I think this should be handled in its patch function.
I see what I can do later.
Meanwhile the rename from "Master" to Headphones" is the only regression.
Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
PS: I reply to this mail with the patch.
