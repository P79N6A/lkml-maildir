Go figure. Apparently the counterfiet-3Com NIC somehow disables the entire 
daughterboard. I found another GX1p and used its daughterboard, noticed it 
worked, then assumed the first one was bad... put the NIC in the second one 
and it's "bad" all of a sudden. Both show up in lspci if I take the NICs out.
FWIW, the NIC claims to be 3C905CX-TXM assembled in USA and matches the 
picture of the counterfeit 3Com cards in
