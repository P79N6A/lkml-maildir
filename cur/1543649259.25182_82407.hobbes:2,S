Then NMI watchdog and oprofile should be changed to use this too. We
also need priority and/or equivalent of NOTIFY_STOP_MASK so we can break
out of calling all the handlers. Actually, why do you continue if one
of the handlers returns 1 anyway ?

Isn't this going to cause cacheline ping pong ?

dev_name is never used at all. What is it for ? Also, would be nice
to do an smp_processor_id() just once and pass that in to prevent
multiple calls to get_current().
Couldn't you modify the notifier code to do the xchg()s (though that's
not available on all CPU types ...)

What uses this ?

Hmm ...
Is it not possible to use linux/rcupdate.h for this stuff ?
