If intel didn't design it to survive having a non SMP OS booted on it
using just one core 100% (say you boot DOS which doesn't have any
idle/sleep stuff in it, just actively spiing looking for input), then
the design is wrong.
I highly doubt that so I wouldn't worry about it.  After all that metal
bit on top of the cpu is called a heat spreader for a reason.  I would
be surprised if you can get more than 10 degrees C difference between
different parts of the core, although that's just a guess.
