What is its purpose? __SMP__ is not just defined or not defined from
the linux kernel source directory, but also used for writing modules
which, in fact, may not exist within the kernel source directory at
all.
So, if such a patch goes into the kernel, module makefiles now have
to be modified to define "CONFIG_SMP" instead of "__SMP__" which,
since they may not even have a "configuration", becomes just another
PITA to support "change for the sake of change".
