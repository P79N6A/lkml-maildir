Ah, OK, I wasn't aware how far advanced you were on this.  I should
have read up a bit more :-).

I think we might be talking about different things -  what I meant was
if you run a kernel compiled to support Xen on X86 natively without
Xen, is there a big performance penalty, not if you run a single VM in
Xen?  I'm thinking that if $BigDistro's installation CD will install
just the same in a virtual machine as anywhere else it'll help to gain
acceptance, and if the performance penalty is low enough, there won't
be a problem there.  Or, to look at it another way, you're effectively
sidestepping the need to distribute a patched OS, because the patched
OS *is* the distributions normal OS.  On the other hand, we don't want
to introduce anything to mainline that is going to hurt embedded
applications, so I think it would be likely to be a distribution
thing.

Z/Series represents a lot more than just virtualisation :-).
On the other hand, I'm sure there are installations where the
virtualisation is the only aspect that they couldn't live without.
