it works really great - previously i had problems with 'secondary'
latencies when running the app with HZ=8192, now i get only the primary
message(s).
i also like it that if you run the app it does a very useful type of
measurement right out of box. The simpler you make a validation app for
kernel developers the more they will use it ;-)
[ btw., FC3's gcc produces this (harmless) warning during the build:
 cc1plus: warning: command line option "-Wstrict-prototypes" is valid 
 for Ada/C/ObjC but not for C++ ]
