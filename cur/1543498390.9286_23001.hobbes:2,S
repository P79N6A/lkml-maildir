Well someone made a comment that it's not really convenient from a code
point of view (rather then script) so I made the suggestion of /dev/cd.
This way you have it even simpler and you know for a fact that everything
in there refers to a cd and as such don't need to search through dirs that
don't have anything to do with what you're looking for.
