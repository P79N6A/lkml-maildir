We should do better... it will require some backend work for the various
supported PICs though. I've always wanted to look into doing a
smp_call_function_cpumask in fact :-)

It would make sense to follow what other archs do. Note that if both
perfmon and topology_init are subsys_initcall, that is on the same
level, it's still a bit hairy to expect one to be called before the
other...
