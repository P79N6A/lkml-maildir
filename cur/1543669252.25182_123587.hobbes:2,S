Start with the file linux/Documentation/basic_profiling.txt
(it's in Linux 2.5.66-or-so or later).
It explains how to use oprofile and readprofile.
You can read about oprofile at 
http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/
 .
You can read about basic in-kernel profiling using /proc/profile
and readprofile via 'man readprofile'.  It's simple to use.
