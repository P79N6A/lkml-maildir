And that is EXACTLY my point.
CMOV is a piece of CRAP for most things, exactly because it serializes 
three streams of data: the two inputs, and the conditional.
My test-case was actually _good_ for cmov, because there was just the one 
conditional (which was 100% ALU) thing that was serialized. In real life, 
the two data sources also come from memory, and _any_ of them being 
delayed ends up delaying the cmov, and screwing up your out-of-order 
pipeline because you now introduced a serialization point that was very 
possibly not necessary at all.
In contrast, a conditional branch-around serializes absolutely NOTHING, 
because branches get predicted.

A lot of the time, the conditional _is_ the critical path.
The whole point of this discussion was that cmov isn't really all that 
great. It has fundamental problems that a conditional branch that gets 
predicted simply does not have.
That's qiute apart from the fact that cmov has rather limited semantics, 
and that in 99% of all cases you have to use a conditional branch anyway.
