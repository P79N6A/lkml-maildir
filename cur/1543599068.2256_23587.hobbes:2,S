That's nice.

smbmount does not understand all flags that mount understands (including
options that mount considers standard). To change permissions you need to
set them with the fmask/dmask options.
smbmount should understand noexec and pass it to the mount syscall as
MS_NOEXEC. But it doesn't, and that's a bug.
Note that noexec does not affect the permissions, it simply makes it
impossible to actually execute things. The files can still have execute
permissions.
