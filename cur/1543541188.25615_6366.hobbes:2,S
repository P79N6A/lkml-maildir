What does free say.. what does vmstat output look like what are
your scripts doing etc etc ;-)  You need to grind down the list of
possibilities as far as you can.

OK, sounds like you may be seeing leakage.  If you would like a
copy of IKD (Integrated Kernel Debugging toolkit) for pre9, drop
me a line offlist.. it contains a memory leak detector which can
help track down leaky spots.
