I have seen something similar when reading CD-Rs (with ISO image burnt);
After I burn a CD I run readcd -c2scan to see if I get any C2 errors;
I am using ASUS 50x CD drive, usually setting the speed to 45x before the
operation (my TEAC CD-RW drive always run at 4x when doing readcd
-c2scan, which is too slow for my patience).
The interesting thing is that while reading ISO image with dd the system
works fine, readcd -c2scan makes it often very unresponsible (just
switching between virtual desktops in KDE may take up to several seconds).
The system is Pentium III running at 720 MHz, ABIT RAID-133 motherboard,
hard disk connected to HPT-370A, CD and CD-RW drived on separate channels,
kernel 2.2.19 + IDE patches, 768 MB RAM.
I am wondering if you could possibly compare the system behaviour with
Linux and FreeBSD when using readcd -c2scan (assuming readcd -c2scan
works with your drives at some reasonable speeds).
Best regards,
Wojtek
