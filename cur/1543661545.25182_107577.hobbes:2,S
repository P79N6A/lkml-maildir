I will try, in the meantime can any kind soul please give me a hint why I
cannot see the interrupts distributed among the CPUs when enabling smp and
apic on this very same box:
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:      71158          0    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        941          0    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
 12:      33166          0    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
 15:          4          0    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 17:       1732          0   IO-APIC-level  ide2, ide3
 18:       3423          0   IO-APIC-level  eth0, eth1
 21:       8177          0   IO-APIC-level  eth2
 22:     112943          0   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 23:         16          0   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 25:         74          0   IO-APIC-level  HiSax
 26:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  EMU10K1
