So here's my first attempt at adding Mathieu's lock-free method to
Steven's get_monotonic_cycles() interface. 
Completely un-tested, but it builds, so I figured I'd send it out for
review.
I'm not super sure the update or the read doesn't need something
additional to force a memory access, but as I didn't see anything 
special in Mathieu's implementation, I'm going to guess this is ok.
Mathieu, Let me know if this isn't what you're suggesting.
