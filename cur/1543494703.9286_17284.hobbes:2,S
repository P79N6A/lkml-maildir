NTFS has a 48bit 'inode number' (the FILE record number) which lasts until a
file is deleted (where deleted = 0 hard links); it can then be reused, but
there is also a 16bit 'generation number' (the sequence number in the FILE
record) which is incremented when the inode is reused. So it should be easy to
do something there.
Dunno about HPFS, but isn't it supposed to be quite similar to NTFS?
