Then to find the match for a given device node you need to enumerate /sys.
And to find a match for a given /sys device you need to enumerate
/dev, or some its subdirectories (/dev/{snd,input,...), or whatever
other random places people have decided to place their device nodes.

Yeah, and /sys/block/sr0 is /dev/scd0 (FC5 default udev rules).

Hmm, "usually"...
Coming to think of it, to solve the dev->sys direction, maybe we
should have symlinks like the following?
/sys/dev/8/0 -> /sys/block/sda
/sys/dev/11/0 -> /sys/block/sr0
/sys/dev/116/24 -> /sys/class/sound/pcmC0D0c
Put otherwise:
Q:Quick, which io scheduler is used by /dev/scd0?
A: cat /sys/dev/$((0x`stat -c%t /dev/scd0`))/\
                $((0x`stat -c%T /dev/scd0`))/queue/scheduler
(Please excuse the ugly hex to dec conversion.)
