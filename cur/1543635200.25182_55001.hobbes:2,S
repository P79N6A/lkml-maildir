Assuming that there are no users of a module, i.e., the current
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT mechanism, checked under a lock, I think all
you have to do to assure race-free module removal is to:
(1)	Make sure that `current` isn't preempted. There are several
        ways to do this. This may require another global variable.
(2)	Execute cleanup_module(). It is assumed that the user-code
	will deallocate interrupts, and free resources, etc.
(3)	Set a global flag "module_remove", it doesn't have to be atomic.
	It needs only to be volatile. It is used in schedule() to trap
	all CPUs.
        schedule()
        {
            while(module_remove)
                ;
        }
(4)	Wait number-of-CPUs timer-ticks with interrupts alive and well.
        This will make certain that everything queued on the timer gets
        a chance to be executed and everything that would be preempted
        gets trapped in schedule().
 
(5)	Remove the module, reset the flag.
The cost is the single variable that must be checked every time schedule()
is executed plus the 'don't preempt me' variable (if necessary).
