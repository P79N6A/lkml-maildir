No, there's no need.  The changes come in several groups:
Performance tweaks:
* Speed up MS_SYNC writes
* speed up fsyncs in non-journaled data modes a little
Config/cosmetic tweaks:
* Set up kjournald to be parented under init properly
* config: ext3 is no longer experimental
Fix bugs introduced at various stages during the 2.4 port:
* don't consider ENOSPC a fatal error when allocating an inode
* fix over-zealous ext3 complaint about locked buffers
* fix O_SYNC
* fix tiny race where a buffer could be written to disk too soon
Fix bugs arising from changes made elsewhere during 2.4:
* fix i_blocks getting inconsistent after disk full
* fix "dump corrupts filesystems" core VFS bug
* fix very rare buffer leak
Fix a bug in the LVM interaction (code isn't present in 2.2):
* fix LVM snapshot deadlock
None of the bug-fixes apply to the 2.2 version of the code.
Cheers,
 Stephen
