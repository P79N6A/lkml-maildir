That might work ... nice idea there, comparing the two masks, so one
only needs to store the ones not yet fixed.  Uunfortunately, I need to
put this aside until I return in four days, from a short trip.
Given that cgroups is targeted for 2.6.24, and that cpusets is broken
without this, I'll have to do something soon.  But this, or some such,
should work, soon enough.
Thanks.

Well ... yeah ... it's a bit of an ugly child.  But I'm its daddy.
The kid looks fine in my eyes. <grin>
