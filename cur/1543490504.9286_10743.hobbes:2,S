table used by your patch.

   Then just edit the script to make it point at the right interpreter.

   Which is exactly what should be done. The kernel is not the right
place to handle DOS crap at.

   If you transfer files between DOS and Linux, you definitely need
to know the CR+LF problem -- if it won't bite you when executing a script,
it will bite you somewhere else anyway.
