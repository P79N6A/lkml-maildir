In the Linux scheduler they use a circular queue implementation with round
robin. What is the advantage of this over just using a normal queue with a
back and front. Also does anyone know what a test plan for such a design
would even begin to look like. This is a project for a proposal going around
in my neighborhood and I am wondering why in the world someone would want to
modify the Linux scheduler to this extent.
