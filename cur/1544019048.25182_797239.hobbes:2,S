I disagree.  It's simple; we create a workqueue and we use it.  There's no
confusion here.

Again, that's how we got here in the first place.  I didn't realize the
twisty path by which the acpi cpufreq code could be called.  And there
may well be others.  So I want work_on_cpu to be completely generic.
Using the existing infrastructure seemed like the right thing.
But since you asked nicely, I'll come up with something cleverer.  It'll
take some serious testing though.

There is no "bug".  See the commit message.

Well, it could have referred to the currently-known case:
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c should be using work_on_cpu,
but we reverted the change because of this problem.
But it's a general comment about fixing a general issue.  The currently
known case is not directly relevent; that it can happen and it's restricting
the use of this otherwise-general API is.

I'm not hiding a bug from you.  Really.
A little confused at all this vitriol,
Rusty.
