Patches to upgrade the freezer and disable the updating of the
load average while we're suspended. The former is primarily
quieting debugging information, adding support for thawing
kernel threads without thawing userspace and freezing bdevs.
The later is needed because suspending is very cpu intensive,
and the load average will be high post-resume if we don't do
this. Having a high load average will in turn cause some
processes such as mtas to delay their work until the number
drops.
