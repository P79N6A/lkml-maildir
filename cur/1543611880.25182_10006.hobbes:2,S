I'm not asking for any change in the development process, the
creation of a test suite, or any quantification of quality. I'm
asking for the consensus.
Here's my level of comfort: I don't want to be on the bleeding edge,
but I want to be on the blade, just a little back from where all the
bloodshed is. I want to run something pretty new, but which lots of 
other people have been able to run without much pain.
The voting idea sounded good, or just tracking what people are running, 
or having someone judge the consensus by gut feel. Any of these would 
guide people like me to the better kernels.
I just want to see some indicator like this on kernel.org pointing me at
which kernels are worth my while to test out and try.
