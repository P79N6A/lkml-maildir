Daniel is comparing 2.4.20-ac2 with 2.4.21-rc6.  In 2.4.20-ac2, APIC
routing is disabled by default and his kernel works.  In 2.4.21-rc6,
APIC routing is enabled by default and interrupts are not properly
routed to his SCSI controller.  If he boots with noapic, everything
works fine.  You'll have to ask Daniel for more details on his system
if you want to figure out why interrupts are not being delivered.
All I know is, from the output and his testing, it is pretty obvious
that interrupts are not being delivered.
