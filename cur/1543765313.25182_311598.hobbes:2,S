Well on my ssytem I can do something as simple as this in a script at
boot (before starting X) and it should nicely take care of it:
modprobe nvidia || m-a -t prepare nvidia && m-a -t build nvidia && m-a -t install nvidia && modprobe nvidia
Most likely I will have a working loaded nvidia driver at that point and
X will start successfully.
m-a is module-assistant which is used on debian to build a module
mathcing the running kernel (assuming it has access to either the source
of the running kernel or the headers of the running kernel) using the
sources from in this case nvidia-kernel-source package.  I don't know if
anything other than debian has anything like this, but it makes dealing
with nvidia's binary drivers fairly tolerable.
