If FIFO is slowing things down it's certainly OK to you LIFO.  If there
is wiggle room (i.e., choose between two descriptors without additional
cost) then taking advantage of this would be of advantage.  A policy
which enforces that only the last closed descriptor is not reused
immediately might might be enough.  Maybe that's too specific for
people's taste.
