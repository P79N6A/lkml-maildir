While they are not strictly needed, I for one would argue they should
probably stay.
if (foo)
  bar();
is not always safe in case bar() is a macro.
if (foo) {
  bar();
}
is always safe and is more robust when the code gets changed later
since you don't accidentally end up with someone mistakenly turning it
into
if (foo)
  bar();
  baz();
