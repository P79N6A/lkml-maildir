I'm a little confused about the way the Linux kernel allocates memory, and
I'm hoping someone could clarify this for me.
Does the __get_free_pages() function eventually call the kmalloc() function?
Or does the kmalloc() function eventually call the __get_free_pages()
function?  Or are these two totally separate functions for different
purposes?
Which of these functions can be called by user process for the purpose of
allocating memory for that user process?
TIA
