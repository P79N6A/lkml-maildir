the ALSA changes are mine but i'm otherwise building ontop of the 
following patch in -rc3-mm1:
 
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.10-rc3/2.6.10-rc3-mm1/broken-out/unlocked_ioctl.patch
whichever approach gets adopted upstream, the various actors ought to
synchronize a bit more - this is the third approach so far in a very
short interval to get rid of the BKL in ioctls :-)
