	but e2fsck does'n know about this :( (at least I didn't dig it
too hard - e2fsprogs-1.14-4 from RH6.0) and it can't find filesystems
based on label, and also lilo sould be modified so we could add LABEL=boot
as a config option.
	could this be extended to DOSFS, VFAT, and other fs (mount could be
modified to use the dos label) and swap partitions (the same with
swap{on,off} - there seems to be some kind of a label for swap but it's set
to 'SWAP-SPACE' now) ?
