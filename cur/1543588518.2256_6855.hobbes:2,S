I run in similar trouble last week after a power breakage.
My superblock was also corupted and I got also the message to try an other
superbock, but I don't know at which address it was (e2fsck don't show you
the correct addresses, it gives only a syntax example). Remembering that
mke2fs shows it, I use it with the test option "-n" (so it only simulate
the making of a filesystem) and got the addresses for the spare superblocks
and was able to recover the filesystem with no data lost.
example:
pingi:~ # mke2fs -n /dev/sdb3
mke2fs 1.19, 13-Jul-2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
Filesystem label=
OS type: Linux
Block size=4096 (log=2)
Fragment size=4096 (log=2)
91392 inodes, 182739 blocks
9136 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
First data block=0
6 block groups
32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group
15232 inodes per group
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
        32768, 98304, 163840
Don't miss the -n option !!!
e2fsck -b 32768 /dev/sdb3
Here are also some howtos related to restoring data and undelete files.
