I am not sure if this would work but you could try registering
different real time signals to be delivered to the shared object
instead of SIGIO. I am not sure if it would work. I do use RT signals
to be used instead of SIGIO.
You could try probably something like this
fcntl (devhandle, SETOWN, getpid ());
fcntl (devhandle, SETSIG, SIGRTMIN);
fcntl (devhandle, SETFL, O_ASYNC);
try registering a signal handler for SIGRTMIN like SIGIO. Could be a
possible solution.
