I suppose it depends on how much contention there will end up being on
the atomic_t, given that right now, the module_ref structure favours
writers (since readers need to loop.) 
I'd like to hear what rusty has to say, but I'm working on a patch
to do module_ref with RCU (and to allocate it in modpost with per_cpu
variables, but that needs more testing.) I'll check what kind of
difference those end up making.

No, but I imagine Rick Jones' netperf would show the effect, if any.
