I'm sure that you've been looking at the Documentation/ tree
in the kernel sources? You should've come across netconsole
then. It will do just about the same as a serial console except
that it uses the network.
With newer kernels I don't think there's much need for
patches or tools. Although there are some things that you can
do to improve the stack traces (configure frame pointers, for
example).
