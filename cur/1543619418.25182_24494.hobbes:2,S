I'm still trying to figure out who all the lieutenants are.  (It seems Andre 
Hedrick reports to Jens Axboe, Rik van Riel might actually report to.. Andrea 
Arcangeli?  (Or Dave Jones.)  But who does Eric send his help patches to?  Is 
Kieth Owens at the top level or what?  It seems like both Kieth and Eric are 
also under Dave Jones.  I guess "patch penguin" is just "Miscelaneous 
Lieutenant".  Makes sense i the new context, I suppose...)
I expect it will all get worked out eventually.  Now that the secret of the 
difference between maintainers and lieutenants is out.  The thread seems to 
be dying down a bit... :)
