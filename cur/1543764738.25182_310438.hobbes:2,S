Inotify 0.22 severly destabilized my 2.6.11 system when it was in use.
The system would get into a state where it was unable to spawn new
processes, the desktop would hang, and the only way to shut down would
be to do a hard reset. This only happened when inotify was in use after
gamin started up.  I was only able to get the following out of the
logs(not every time though):
