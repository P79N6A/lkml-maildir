Willy,
I do think we need a generic way to be sure that certain routines are
run only on cpu0.
I don't see it in the ACPI spec, but it seems that on some platforms,
some register accesses (such as writing to the sleep control reg) are
reliable only when accessed from cpu0.
This issue has been with us for some time:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1141
I am hopeful that the prepare-shutdown sequence you suggest below will
not be necessary.
thanks,
-Len
