I was more concerned with the "value" ... that expands to a conditional,
which is likely to cost a couple more instructions regardless, which in
space terms competes with a function call.
But I concluded much the same thing when I did that experimental
conversion ... not because I was comparing the space for conditional
vs funcall, but because the existing code already had the conditional.
If more code savings can be had later, so be it ... no rush for now.
