Subject: The mbox format archives of linux-kernel are gone.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I would like to find the history of linux-kernel in mbox format.  I thought it 
was under 
http://kernel.org/pub
 but apparently not.
Rooting around at 
http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-kernel
 points 
to a bunch of stale links.  (The alaska archive is gone, the helsinki one 
stopped in 2004, the indiana one mbox link is 404...)
The linux-kernel faq's archives entry points to web archives, where I can look 
up one post at a time.  I could do that through google groups.  I used to be 
able to see "month at a time" indexes at lists.insecure.org, but that took 
its' linux-kernel archive down last year.
I found Zach Brown asking for them and getting them anonymously sent to him, 
but no download link and one reason I want them is Kernel Traffic stopped 
updating in 2005 and I've fallen behind on the list again.
This link:
http://mailman.linuxchix.org/pipermail/techtalk/2005-February/019865.html
Suggests that mbox files may be found on lkml.org, which doesn't seem to be 
true (not on their current main page, nor archive.org, nor any browsing 
around I've managed to do...)
Does anyone have any suggestions?  Google is being unhelpful...
