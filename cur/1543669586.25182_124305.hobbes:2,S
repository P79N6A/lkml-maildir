Ok, I tried this one on top of 2.4.21-pre6 (can't compile -pre7) and had to
find out, that it freezes on X startup. I have never experienced something like
that before.
Anything I can do/test? There is no oops, just freeze (screen does not turn
black, kdm freezes in the middle of the startup, displays window borders but no
images).
