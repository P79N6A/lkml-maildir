That's not the problem for the usb-serial drivers.  The
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE referenced structure is only needed if the drivers
are compiled as modules.  The code uses a different usb_device_id
structure to register itself with the usb-serial core (see the code for
the reason why.)
Keith's proposed change looks like it will solve this problem nicely.
