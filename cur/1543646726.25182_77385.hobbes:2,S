Well, here we go again, there are other issues as well.
There's a race between open() and disconnect(). The best way to deal
with it is to introduce a common semaphore for all devices the driver handles
and to take it as the first thing open() and disconnect() do and release it 
as the last thing. In addition every device needs a flag to show that it has
been opened and a flag to show that it has been unplugged. Alternatively
you could introduce device states, being "present and unused", "present and 
used" and "unplugged but used". As this needs to be checked in release(), it 
needs to take the semaphore as well.
