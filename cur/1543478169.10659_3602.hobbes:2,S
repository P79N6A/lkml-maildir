Hi!
I'm one of those kernel hackers who use 'make xconfig' to configure the
kernel, and I'm getting increasingly alarmed at the size of the main menu.
I run X in 1280x1024, and it's already just slightly larger than the
screen.  If it gets any bigger, then it's going to be too unusable.
Are there any plans to introduce sub-menus, or scroll bars for the main
menu to xconfig?
