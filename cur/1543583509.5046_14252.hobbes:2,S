	The only difference is in the case when size is a multiple of
PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT, so most of the time it's the same, but yeah, this
variant is probably nicer.
	The problem with putting it into ->truncate() is obvious -
handling errors. And doing the thing before vmtruncate() (in
foo_notify_change(), whatever) is also PITA - you need to
reproduce the rlimit handling. Not nice...
	IOW, if it's worth doing at all it probably should be
on expanding path in vmtruncate() - limit checks are already
done, but old i_size is still not lost...
