Yes.
I have not found any report related exactly to my problem in the
mailing lists or bug reports. But to be sure I didn't overlook something
I posted my problem. It looks like it's unique to me.
I failed to produce a simple example demonstrating the problem. In our
code we use timers and real time signals and we change process masks
with sigprocmask. If there is a bug at all (I don't think so) a
program to demonstrate that bug would potentially have to do all of
these things and would therefore not be simple.
Following Bart Van Assche's suggestion.
I did use valgrind (the default tool and helgrind) but I did not find
anything obviously related to my problem.

No. We don't use threads. The mutexes are used between processes. I used
them because they feature recursion.

I found a workaround. We use normal semaphores now. This is possible
because we don't use multiple threads. In order to provide recursion I
had to implement a per process counter. This would not work if the
semaphore was required during signal handler execution. But this dose not
happen in our application.

No since we don't use multiple threads.
The reason why I wondered it is an issue (maybe configuration) of the
kernel was that sending a STOP CONT signal sequence to the hanging
process got it going again. So at least it is not a classical dead lock.
