It will. I've been using extents for ages, for the same reasons. I don't
put them in an rb_tree because I view it as less than most efficient,
but it will still be a huge step forward from bitmaps in the normal
case.
The worst case would be if every second page of swap was in use, so that
you needed one extent per swap page. In that case, it would use more
memory than the bitmap, but far, far more common will be the case where
only one extent is needed for the whole swap partition, because the
algorithm used by the swap allocator minimises fragmentation.

Nigel
