A build with NO_MAKEFILE_GEN=1 is _not_ necessarily complete or
correct.  NO_MAKEFILE_GEN is for quick compiles to catch typing errors
or to add the odd printk, I cannot guarantee that the result has
recompiled everything.  I suppose I could add an option like
I_KNOW_THAT_THIS_BUILD_MAY_BE_INCORRECT_BUT_I_WANT_TO_INSTALL_IT_ANYWAY ;)

Shadow trees already handle separate compilation.  Unlike kbuild 2.4,
nothing else is recompiled in kbuild 2.5, unless you have changed it.
