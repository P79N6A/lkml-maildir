Subject: copy on write fault optimization patch for 2.3.35
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/7/216

While profiling the kernel I noticed that the first thing a newly forked
process does it take a COW fault on the current user stack page
even if the process execs right away.  A simple optimization is to copy
the child's stack page rather than setting it up for COW in the
copy_page_range() function.   Since you know the child is going to
incur the fault anyway you might as well just copy the page rather
than setting up for a fault to do it.
What does everyone think, is this worth doing???
