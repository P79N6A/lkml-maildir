I've asked their tech support folks about where and how big in flash the RISC
code is for all their cards. I have other people I can ask too. Let's see if
they're helpful or open about it.
I'm not as sensitive to the bloat issues as I should be- I suppose because I
tend to see all of USB as bloat myself :).. I tend to think that the generic
shipping kernel case should have all of the firmware images there to download
from the driver.
That said, it *would* be nice to give people some tools to strip things down
if they really want, out of a 2GB system, a couple hundred kbytes back that
can the be gobbled up by something really hungry for it like a memory leak in
X or Matzohilla or something :-)....
