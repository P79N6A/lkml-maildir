While I agree with your observation in general, this is actually
something the compiler should be able to figure out by itself:
 - there's only a side-effect if acm is NULL
 - in ACM_READY, we've already tested acm for NULL, and subsequently
   de-referenced it
 - acm is a local variable, and not aliased, so the dbg() can't
   change it
So, given the negations, || and | are equivalent in this case, and
whether a jump, conditional execution, a bit operation, or something
else yields better code is compiler, machine, and context specific.
