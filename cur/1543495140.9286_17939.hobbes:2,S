This mean that they must my tree to do the benchmark:

Killing atime and all other issues are really _minor_ issues compared to
my redesign of the flushtime handling, of the dirty buffer garbage
collection and on my new shrink_mmap design.
If the benchmark imply VM and I/O load, my tree will give a big boost (as
_worse_ a 10% improvement) and it's rock solid (I doesn't work by luck).
I also have a patch against pre-2.2.8-4 but I want to finish fixing the
new scheduler in the pre-patches before releasing it (I plan to finish
tomorrow).
How can I get in touch with people how is doing the benchmark?
