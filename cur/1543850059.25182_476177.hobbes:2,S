I have send out patches doing the correct priority adjustment without 
touching the wait_lock. Why not use that?
I found it in the archives:
  
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0610.0/0049.html
(or more specific in 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0610.0/0051.html,
 look for 
changes to sched.c)
It is very bad to do PI traversal in interrupt context. In the general 
case, where there are user-space locks, that operation unbounded. I 
know that in your case you can only traverse kernel locks, but I think it 
is bad to open for such posibilities if it can be avoided.
