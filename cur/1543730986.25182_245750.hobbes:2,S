/bin could be separated (like linus said) but cat /bin/.compound could do
it. This is the /etc/passwd Hans' example, I think:
"If /new_syntax_access_path/big_directory_of_small_files/.glued is a plugin that
aggregates every file in big_directory_of_small_files with a delimiter
separating every file within the aggregation, then one can simply type emacs
/new_syntax_access_path/big_directory_of_small_files/.glued, and the filesystem
has done all the work emacs needs to be effective at this. Not a line of emacs
needs to be changed."
