Hi, All
I am using PowerPC target board and want to transfer files from board
to a Linux FTP server.
The current issue is that FTP server returns ERROR when I sending
"STOR filename" from client.
But command "TYPE type", "PASS password" and "USER username" can work
correctly between board and server.
My question is how can I debug  or what tools can be used in Linux
server to track what's going on in server.
I guess there should be a lot of scenarios which can caused the STOR
command get error return code, I appreciate if you can list some.
Thanks!
