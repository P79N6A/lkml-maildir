Because it is really not. The mixing is done directly to the mmaped DMA 
buffer.

We're not doing that. We're just showing that OSS API and useability has 
it's own problems, too.

ALSA kernel API is real and binary compatible. If someone require to
write an own library, we will document this API, of course, too.

Already done. We have official plugin SDK in alsa-lib to create user space 
drivers. If you have some questions or bug-reports (missing docs etc), 
please, fill a bug report.
Also, you can use very simple LADSPA plugin style, because alsa-lib can 
use LADSPA plugins directly, too.
