If the bit does not actually alter /hardware/ operation, then
ATA_FLAG_IGN_SIMPLEX use is preferred over having to remember various 
places where the bit must be twiddled.  Its easier to leave the bit in 
the BIOS-initialized state, and ignore the hardware bit's existence in 
software, if we know the behavior in the controller is hardwired.  Less 
room for software bugs that way, IMO.
