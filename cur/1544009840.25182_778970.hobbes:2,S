I don't think so. 64bit systems don't have ZONE_HIMEM - this is why I 
was referring to 32 bit.
More to the point, many devices don't have any issues accessing full 64 
bit addressing mode and many 64bit machines have IOMMU that will take 
care of those devices that DO have a problem. Adding this flag will just 
penalize the MM sub-system for no reason.  For the rare case where there 
is a device that cannot do 64 bit addressing in a 64 bit machine with no 
IOMMU, AFAIK bounce buffers are used to overcome the issue.
Cheers,
