Hi,
 I'm developing linux kernel for ARM cpu with direct-mapped
instruction cache, sometimes I notice that the pefromance of the
kernel (for some test) is highly dependent on the code layout, in
order to fix that I added new code section, and for each kernel
function that highly invokerd I added compiler attribute so it will
allocated in that section (exactly as the __init section). but it
bothers me that I need to change the kernel source code, so is there
any way to do that externally (without touching C code)?
