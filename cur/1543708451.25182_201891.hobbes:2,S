Hi Eric,
Problem solved.
The Fusion chip is soldered onto the motherboard.  I went into
the BIOS and discovered a little selection called (paraphrased)
'Execute LSI firmware' which was disabled.  When I enabled it,
all the boottime Fusion errors and warning went away.
This is a dual Opteron system branded 'Celsius' and made by
Fujitsu/Siemens.
It would be great if the driver could detect this and print
a 'is the LSI Fusion firmware enabled?' message in the log.
Regards, and thank you for looking into this,
Joe
