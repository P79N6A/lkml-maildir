I might have jumped in the middle of a discussion out here, but the
better solution to this would be to have UTIME in the kernel. It does
not muck around with the system time much and it does not reprogram
the interrupts to happen more frequently than necessary. While there
are a few bugs in the system the only way to fix those is to have
a much wider test audience.
Check out

 for more details.
We are very keen on getting this into the kernel if at all possible
