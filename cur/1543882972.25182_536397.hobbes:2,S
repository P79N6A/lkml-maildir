While that would certainly be nifty, I think we're arguably starting 
from the wrong point here. Why are we booting a kernel, trying to poke 
the hardware back into some sort of mock-quiescent state, freeing memory 
and then (finally) overwriting the entire contents of RAM rather than 
just doing all of this from the bootloader? Given the time spent in 
kernel setup and unpacking initramfs nowadays, I'm willing to bet it'd 
still be faster even if you're stuck using int 13 on x86.

 suggests that Intel is looking into this, 
but I haven't heard anything more yet. To the best of my knowledge, this 
is also how Windows manages things.
