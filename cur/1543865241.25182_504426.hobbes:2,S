If this is the right strategy for disk recovery for a given type of
device then this ought to be an automatic strategy. Most end users will
not have the knowledge to frob about in sysfs, and if the bad sector hits
at the wrong moment a sensible automatic recovery strategy is going to do
the right thing faster than human intervention, which may be some hours
away.
