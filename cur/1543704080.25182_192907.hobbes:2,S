I think we're getting a little confused here.
I'm saying that people should start using module_param instead of
MODULE_PARM in new code, or code being reworked.  This adds a boot
param where there was none before.
I'm explicitly not advocating replacing __setup() for existing code.

That's bad.  I would have left the old __setup under #ifdef
CONFIG_OBSOLETE_MODPARM (or something where it can eventually go
away).  And maybe a printk warning about using the old name.

Perhaps I am the wrong target, but I'm glad you brought it up.
I thought that changing __setup to module_param() would have obvious
effects, and authors would make their own call on that.
FYI: __setup and module_param() *CAN* be freely mixed, unlike
MODULE_PARM and module_param().
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
