This is not the problem. The exported filesystem is marked insecure. The 
problem is that on the machine running Petes patch you cannot even start the 
kernel nfsd, no matter what /etc/export contains. I f you try to start 
/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd (the kernel nfsd version) it tries to register with 
portmap and to my interpretation the kernel denies this request with the 
message from above. Since no nfsd can be started I cannot mount any 
filesystem from this host.
So I still think that the reason for this is a check in the kernel, that 
prevents connections from ports > 1024. But where exactly is this done?
Thanks Rainer
