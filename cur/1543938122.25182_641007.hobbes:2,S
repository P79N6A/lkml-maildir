Thanks, that answers that particular question; the vcpu is blocked 
waiting for something to happen, which probably means it missed the 
event which was supposed to wake it up.  Why is another question.  At 
least there's a workaround, and that workaround gives me some clue where 
to look.
BTW, is it an SMP or UP domain?   Does it make a difference?
