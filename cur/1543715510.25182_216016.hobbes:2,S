In 2.6.5 (not sure about other versions) there is a bug/problem in the
drivers/ide/pci/siimage.c driver.  I have only tested this with my Si3112
chipset on an ASUS A7N8X-Deluxe mobo.  I did not discover this fix, and
I'll post a url below to the original source.  No idea if this has been
fixed/looked at already, but it definitely needs to be resolved.
hdparm -t speed without fix: 16mb/s
hdparm -t speed with fix: 55mb/s

Incase the link is down/broken, to fix the bug change line 269 of
drivers/ide/pci/siimage.c from:
        u32 speedt              = 0;
to:
        u16 speedt              = 0;

Brenden
