Subject: [PATCH 00/12] Resource Groups... formerly CKRM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
CKRM has gone through a major overhaul by removing some of the complexity,
cutting down on features and moving portions to userspace.
We have posted ckrm last week as an RFC:
infrastructure:
	
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0604.2/1297.html
numtasks controller:
	
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0604.2/1311.html
CPU controller:
	
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0604.2/1310.html
Diffstat of this patchset (including the numtasks controller that follows)
is:
	23 files changed, 2466 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)
including Documentaion and comments.
This patchset will be followed with two controllers:
	- a simple controller, numtasks to control number of tasks
	- CPU controller, to control CPU resource.
Please consider these for inclusion in -mm tree.

Changes since last post:
 - CKRM has been replaced with Resource Groups
