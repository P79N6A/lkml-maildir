atomic_long_t seems to be the right choice on s390. IRQ disable/enable is
expensive, but the compare and swap instruction is cheap. I just gave it
a quick shot, but please note that there were two hypervisors running below
my system (add_return is missing since I used your first patch):
atomic_long	19  18  -  3  17
irqsave/rest	57  58  - 39  22
trivalue	43  43  -  4  45
local_t		18  20  -  2  16
