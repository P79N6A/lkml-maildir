The architecture independant changes are fine, since
they're also useful for S390(x), PPC64 and UML...

I wonder if the same effect could be achieved by just
measuring the VM pressure inside the guests and
ballooning the guests as required, letting them grow
and shrink with their workloads.
That wouldn't need many kernel changes, maybe just a
few extra statistics, or maybe all the needed stats
already exist.  It would also allow more complex
policy to be done in userspace, eg. dealing with Xen
guests of different priority...
