OK.
cond_resched() is usually a waste of space with CONFIG_PREEMPT.  It might
make sense to define a cond_resched_if_not_preempt thingy, which only does
things if !CONFIG_PREEMPT.  We'd still need to use cond_resched() inside
lock_kernel().

I think Ingo's patch includes Arjan's one.  Ingo's patch apparently breaks
ext3.  I have a bunch of ext3 and other fixes here, but there's still an occasional
problem on SMP.
