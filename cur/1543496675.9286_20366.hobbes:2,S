Actually, I think you are wrong here. I suspect that they dn't think
they can keep IRIX going much longer outside of a very narrow field --
NT killed their lock on graphics. If they start pushing NT, they'll
kill their hardware, too, more than likely. *BUT*, if they push Linux,
then a) they'll likely sell more hardware and b) they are getting a
lot more people out there who aren't afraid of Unix.
Both of these are good things, from both their and our points of view.
