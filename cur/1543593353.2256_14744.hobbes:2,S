Possibly saying something extremly stupid here,
how about simply "fakewriting" 0xFF to the flash
after an erase to update any caches?

 do_erase_stuff();
 /* While verifying, update cache */
                for (address = adr; address < (adr + size); address++) {
                        if ((verify = map->read8(map, address)) != 0xFF) {
                                error = 1;
                                break;
                        }
                        /* "Fake" write 0xFF's to the erased sector so that
caches are updated
                         *  after we verified that uncached data is ok
                         */
                        *(unsigned char*)CACHED(address) = 0xFF;
                }
