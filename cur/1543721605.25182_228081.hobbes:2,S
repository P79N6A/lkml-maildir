I do not agree with that statement.  Those files were placed in the
kernel tree in good faith that they could be redistributed.  I have the
email trails to prove it.  If the wording is somehow not correct to
convey this intent, I will be quite willing to fix it.

I do not agree that this copyright holder has anything to do with the
code in that area at all.  I only see two named copyright holders on the
drivers/usb/serial/keyspan.c file:
    (C) Copyright (C) 2000-2001   Hugh Blemings <hugh@blemings.org>
    (C) Copyright (C) 2002        Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>
Adam did submit a small patch to the file back in 11/01/2000, but as to
if that constitutes a multiple copyright of that file, I'll leave to the
IP lawyers to decide.

For the emi26 firmware image, yes, I agree the wording is not very
clear, but I have documentation that the original owner of the file gave
permission to have these files included in the kernel tree.  I will add
the proper wording from the keyspan firmware image to that file in my
tree and send it to Linus in the next series of USB patches.
As for the wording of the keyspan firmware images, I do not agree that
this is not allowed.  We have been over this many times in the past, and
I've had IP lawyers look at the current wording and implementation of
these files and they have given me their blessing that it is ok to do
so.

Again, I am reacting to the emi26 image.  The keyspan dispute I do not
agree with.  We are free to disagree with each other here, but until I
receive a contrary legal opinion, I will insist that these files remain.
