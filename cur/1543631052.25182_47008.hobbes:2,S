Hello all !!!
My last e-mail was a sort of confused so I'm gonna try again:
I am implementing (or trying to) inverseARP for frame-relay. Every thing goes 
ok until the time I have to insert a new route on the Route Table of the 
kernel.
I have a struct device and the destination address. What I have to do to add 
the new route to the system from the kernel-space.
thanks in advance
Henrique
