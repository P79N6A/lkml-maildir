Good, then the hang should be caused by:
			  Store (Arg0, HCSL)
			  Store (ShiftLeft (Arg1, 0x01), HMAD)
			  Store (Arg2, HMCM)
			  Store (0x0B, HMPR)
Could you add this at the beginning of this block:
	Store (Arg0,  Debug)
And add this at the end of this block:
	Store( HMPR, Debug)
Also change boot option: acpi_debug_layer=0x00100010,
acpi_debug_level=0x10
Let me verify if ec access is just ok.

Probably yes.

Yes, that's good idea to have separate i2rb copy for THM0 which we are
hacking.
