But that still doesn't make it sync. I think you are working the wrong
way. For ssd we still want merging and plugging also makes sense to some
degree, though it probably should be minimized. It'll only cause an
initial latency, for busy IO workloads you wont be plugging/unplugging
much anyway.
In fact your patch makes things WORSE, since the io schedulers will now
treat the IO as sync and introduce idling for the disk head. And you
definitely don't want that.
