Ah, my board has that kind of documentation. Well, then I might do
just this - or see if my board can do that for me. Also, I'd really
want to know if maybe I can split apart the two SATA channels.

Ah, that sounds interesting.

Hmm. I got pciutils 2.1.11 (those claim to be the latest), but my
lspci doesn't know "-l". I attached the output of lspci -vvv to this
mail, however. Maybe it's of any use.
I attached the output of acpidmp to this mail as well. It's a
collection of hexdumps. Since I have no internal knowledge about ACPI
or IO-APICs, I can't do anything with it...

Sorry, I didn't quite understand your last sentence with the fruits
and the rent. I suppose it's some expression, but I'm not a native
english speaker.
But I already disabled everything I don't need in the BIOS (I need
USB, however) and the situation didn't improve very dramatically. At
least I can't see of any devices having changed place in the IRQ list,
only that the devices I deactivated have gone. I also enable "Reset
ESCD data" in the BIOS to encourage things getting rearranged.

Hmm. If I remember correctly the IRQs stay XT-PIC if I don't enable
ACPI, regardless wether IO-APIC is enabled or not. And the old style
PIC of course leads to the result of my interrupts being very
crowded...
Thanks for your help!
