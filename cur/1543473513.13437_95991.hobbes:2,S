Hi,
2.2.0-pre1-ac2 fails to boot on my Cyrix 6x86, since it wrongly detects
that I am trying to boot a kernel compiled for a 586 on a 486. (The
kernel is indeed compiled for a 586 class processor, I believe this is
the correct thing to do in this case, and has always worked correctly in
the past).
I ran ac1 for ~24 hours or so without problem.
/proc/cpuinfo (from pre1-ac1) is below. If any more info is required,
just ask.
