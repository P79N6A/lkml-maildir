No, one rule would be MUCH faster. What's do you think would be faster of the two:
if ((ipaddr>=3232235521)&&(ipaddr<=3232235774))
    return 1;
else
    return 0;
or
for (a=0;a<(3232235774-3232235521);a++)
    if (ipaddr==a)
        return 1;
return 0;
Obviously it compares the 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.255 range, but I think we both
know which one will be faster. Not to mention countless other redundant checks
will be added in on both, but on the second one the time of the checks is
multiplied by the number of times you have too loop.
But, I'm just a newbie so I don't really know :P Just taking up bandwith :(
