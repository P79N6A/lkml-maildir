This sounds like the waker process (nice 19) not getting a chance to
run.  You can hack around it for the moment by changing "nice(19)" in
Documentation/lguest/lguest.c to something less aggressive.
The real solution is to switch to an fd.  Fortunately, I have just such
a patch.  I am shuffling it forward in my queue now, and will send when
testing is complete...
Thanks!
Rusty.
