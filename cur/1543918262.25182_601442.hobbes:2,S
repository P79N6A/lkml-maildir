When it has no m (or equivalent like g) constrained argument 
and no memory clobber.

You add any of the above.

You could do a memory clobber, but it would be heavier than the volatile
because the memory clobber clobbers all cached variables. volatile essentially 
just says "don't remove; has side effects". Normally gcc does that automatically
for something without outputs, but this one has.
Besides a CRx access does not actually clobber memory.
