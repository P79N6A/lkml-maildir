Hi,
A year ago, commit abf75a5033d4da7b8a7e92321d74021d1fcfb502 was included
to fix a security vulnerability that is related to prctl privilege
escalation, and suid_dumpable (CVE-2006-2451). But the commit was just a
quick fix to prevent users from calling prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 2).
This patch series try to remove code that is related to the value 2
(suidsafe) core dump mode, and also re-implement Hidehiro-san's
re-implementation of dumpable using a bit flag instead of a pair (see
commit 6c5d523826dc639df709ed0f88c5d2ce25379652).
Thanks,
Eugene
