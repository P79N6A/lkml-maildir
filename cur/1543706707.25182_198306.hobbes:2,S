We plan to support 2.4 based releases for several years yet. If Vojtech
approves what you did for 2.6, I am all for a backport to Marcelo tree.
Marcelo is not very forthcoming with approvals these days, but perhaps
it may be folded into some update. But as usual I would like to avoid
carrying a patch in Red Hat tree, if at all possible.
