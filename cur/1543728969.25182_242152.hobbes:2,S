A number of kbuild updates and Randy's Kconfig.debug
Most important stuff is:
o Get rid og bogus "has no CRC" when building external modules
o Rename *.lds.s to *.lds (*)
o Allow external modules to use host-progs
(*) The renaming of the *.lds file has been doen to allow the kernel to
be build with for example Cygwin.
The major outstanding issue with Cygwin/Solaris are availability of
certain .h files for the tools in scripts/* and spread in the tree.
Tested patches that allows the tools to be build under Cygwin/Solaris
are appreciated.
Patches follows this mail.
Everything pushed to:
