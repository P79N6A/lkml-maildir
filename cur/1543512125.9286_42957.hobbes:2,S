I don't think so. Look, it's not a matter of protecting i_size - it's a
separate problem. We are seriously abusing i_size in the call of
->truncate() anyway. What I am looking for is
	truncate may be sure that blocks belonging to file will remain
that way and no new will appear. IOW, truncate can trust the contents of
inode/indirect blocks/FAT chain/whatever.
That's it. write() does lock the page before writing to it/allocating new
blocks/etc. _That_ protection should be enough to avoid several callers of
write() messing with each other.
