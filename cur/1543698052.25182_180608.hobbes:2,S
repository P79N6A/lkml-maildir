And it just goes to prove that old adage about owning cats.
There's some confusion in the humans mind about who owns whom.  There 
is none whatsoever in the cats mind.  He owns you, and thats not open 
for discussion.  Its just how it is.
Me, I'm a dog person.  Our Shelty might think he's people, but he 
knows damned well that in this pack, I'm the alpha male.
