hmm, you are right, documenting it in the code comment is not really
enough here, because there are going to be performance corner cases
and such for this patch (as well as the whole tracking dirty patchset)

actually, there is a great deal of variation in the test results once
you get into the large I/O part of the test.  also, the fact that we
are tracking mmap'd pages at all changes the preformance.  here are
links which compare the old and new configurations, but with
dirty_pages set to 40 on both:

http://namesys.com/intbenchmarks/iozone/06.06.19.tracking.dirty.page-noatime_-B/r4-2.6.16_vs_tr.drt.pgs-rt.40.html
grev posted the variance as well, but for some reason the link doesn't work.
