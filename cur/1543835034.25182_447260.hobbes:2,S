Maybe it would be best to have a virtual driver that knows about the union 
of the features, and makes whatever features are provided by the 
underlying driver available to userspace. That way, all of the drivers are 
implementing features out of a shared set, so you don't end up with 
thinkpad/force_discharge and something/discharge_battery. This is the 
principle behind, for example, the generic cdrom driver, which doesn't 
actually implement much but rather provides uniformity across devices 
handled by different drivers.
I don't think this is a case where each driver provides very similar 
functionality, but with critical differences which can't be corrected for; 
it seems like features are clearly available or not.
Of course, userspace can figure out which features are available by 
checking which files exist in the sysfs directory.
