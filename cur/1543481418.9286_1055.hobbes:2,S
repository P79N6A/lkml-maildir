Not exactly. Look at Pavel Machek's changes included in the latest bdflush
release (V1.6, IIRC). This way, spin down/spin up can well be handled in
user space, using SCSI_IOCTL_{START,STOP}_UNIT in either a seperate
utility or maybe a patch to hdparm. The only thing really missing as of
now is a facility reporting per-drive stats (or idle time alternatively).
