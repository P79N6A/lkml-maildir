Existing programs work fine if you do something like this first:
    echo bios_head:255 > /proc/ide/hda/settings
I know this works because it is how I convince Parted to prep a blank
drive for installing Windows.  In fact, it is the only way for me to
communicate the geometry to Parted, as far as I know.  (Other tools
usually have command-line switches or "expert" settings to control the
geometry; Parted does not.)
SCSI and RAID devices already return a suitable geometry in
HDIO_GETGEO on all of the systems that I or my users have tried.
So one approach is to leave HDIO_GETGEO alone, and to have a userspace
gadget run early to "fix" the kernel's notion of the geometry.  This
would avoid the need to rewrite every partitioning tool.
