DNS IS the problem.
Imagine you have
www.somewhere.com and it has IP 192.168.10.1
For some reason you change the IP to 192.168.11.1 for about a week you will
get requests to 192.168.10.1 although you changed the IP to 11.1
Now Imagine you have a few hundret IP-Adresses you have to change. And a
mixed setup of Linux/Windows NS/DOS(Concorde)/... machines.
For short :
a) DNS IS the problem
b) I can't give both IPs to one machines. (There are enough machines i
   can't even reach, where i call the customer and tell him to change to
   the new IP. No chance to explaim them how to give the machines 2 IPs.
   And enough machines where it simply isn't possibel)
Bis denn
