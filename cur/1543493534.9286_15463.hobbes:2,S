Aha! This makes much more sense. I removed all of the semaphore/mutex
stuff and stuck with the spinlocks.
I still had problems, but only in some circumstances. I tracked it down
to adding a an entry to a list_head twice thus creating a circular
list. The thread was never giving up processor control and eventually
I'd get all kinds of weird oops'.
Thanks very much for clarification. This significantly simplifies
things.
