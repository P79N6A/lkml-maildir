Thanks for the response Phillip. See below for response.
I already am using "console=ttyS0" as well as set the inittab correctly.
I would like to debug this node behavior. Can you please let me know
which routine gets called first when there is, for example a read() call
from user program. Eventually it will result in a call to what ever read
routine registered, but that must be a call back function or some thing.
Right?

The filesystem sets specific bits in the mode mask and elsewhere in the 
inode to mark the file as a dev node, and which major/minor device 
number it should be linked to.  The kernel device drivers register to 
handle a given device number.

So you did you pass the console=ttyS0 parameter to the kernel?  Did you 
configure your inittab to spawn the getty on the serial port instead of 
/dev/ttyN?  You might want to take a look at the Linux Serial Console 
HOWTO.
