Hello Folkert

There was. A fellow in Belgium had started to write a stack
to support LU2 3270 sessions to allow terminal access to his
mainframe. The 802.2 LLC code in the kernel is part of his
work. However it was never finished because they installed
TCP/IP on the mainframe and he was able to TELNET into it,
maybe using x3270 I forget. That was all about two years ago.
Unfortunately I haven't got his name or e-mail address handy.

I would suggest the nearest protocol in the existing stacks is
X.25, a VC based protocol. For my sins I wrote it originally,
maybe a clone and modification of that stack would be the
easiest path, certainly X.25 is closer to SNA than (say) TCP/IP.

Feel free to chat about it with me on e-mail.

Will do.
