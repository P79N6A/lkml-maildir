??? It would be a bug for the request to be sitting on _any_ queue when
it enters xprt_transmit().
Here is the patch that I'm currently testing.

RPC: Fix the TCP resend semantics for NFSv4
Fix a regression due to the patch "NFS: disconnect before retrying NFSv4
requests over TCP"
The assumption made in xprt_transmit() that the condition
	"req->rq_bytes_sent == 0 and request is on the receive list"
should imply that we're dealing with a retransmission is false.
Firstly, it may simply happen that the socket send queue was full
at the time the request was initially sent through xprt_transmit().
Secondly, doing this for each request that was retransmitted implies
that we disconnect and reconnect for _every_ request that happened to
be retransmitted irrespective of whether or not a disconnection has
already occurred.
Fix is to move this logic into the call_status request timeout handler.
