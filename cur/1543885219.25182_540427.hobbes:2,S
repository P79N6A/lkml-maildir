cdc-acm does its own buffering.
In your case, the line discipline throttled the tty device
because the ldisc buffer was full.
If the line discipline throttles the driver input,
the cdc-acm driver stops giving data to the tty buffering
and instead stores them internally.
In the serial driver this usually just results in dropping
RTS to signal the remote end to stop sending. The serial
driver always immediately gives receive data to the tty buffering
without regard to the throttled state.
I would argue that cdc-acm should do the same as the serial driver.
