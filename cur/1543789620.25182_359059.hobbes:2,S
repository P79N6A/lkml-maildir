Hi,
To all: There is serious data corruption issue with ntfs in
2.6.14-rc4-mm1 (and ntfs 2.1.25 release in general, not just -mm).  Fix
is below.  Hopefully this is the only bug!

I am really sorry about this.  )-:  You should be able to hopefully fix
windows by booting with the installation CD and going into recovery
console and running chkdsk on the partition.  You can also try running
ntfsfix from ntfsprogs and then booting into windows.  This may be
sufficient to allow it to do a chkdsk on the partition before it
crashes.
I found a bug that caused corruption of the openoffice document as you
described.  The fix is below.

Thank you very much for testing and I am really sorry it caused the
corruption to your partition.  In the future I will make sure to say
"Please only test on test partitions."...
Best regards,
