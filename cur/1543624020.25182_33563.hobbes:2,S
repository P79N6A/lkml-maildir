I want such a beast, too:-)))

Planned work next:
1. Try John Stultz's mcslocks 
        (note high max wait vs low max hold currently)
2. Try rmap + pagemap_lru_breakup from Arjan
3. Try radix tree pagecache.
4. Try grafting NUMA-Q page local alloc onto -aa tree
5. Try SGI NUMA zone ordering stuff.
6. [HARD] Break up ZONE_NORMAL between nodes 
   (all currently on node 0).

No flamewar intended, but shouldn't you start with 4. and 5.?
-aa is the way to go for the 2.4.18+ tree. -rmap later for 2.5.x.
Have you tried the OOM case?
vm_29 and before fixed it for me.
Throughput is much improved with -aa.
Have you checked latency?
I found weird behavior of latest O(1)-K3 with latencytest0.42-png and higher 
latency then with clean 2.4.18.
Do you have some former O(1) versions around? Ingo removed them form his 
archive.
Preemption?
Running 2.4.19-pre2-dn1 :-)

BTW Anyone out there who have a copy of the mem "test" prog handy?
I've accidentally removed one of my development folders...
Would be nice to see some "Hammer" systems from IBM next winter;-)
