Autoconfigure cannnot solve this.
The card is not in my database.
To help user, you should tell the driver maintainer to add our card
in the know pci devices. In this manner autoconfigure, hotplug and
modutils can take easy use your card.
This is also a problem of PCI design.
ISAPNP have the function type, USB have also the
function class, so that there exists few interfaces, and kernel
can ask only to specific interface and not to the specific card.
PCI also have the interface field, but not very used, and the
interfaces are also not so standardized.
