At least gcc3 has [v][s][n]printf and friends as builtins, and also
has __builtin_va_list,_start,_end, etc, so it looks easy to get rid of 
the
stdarg.h dependency.
Easy way: create stdarg.h in kernel includes with defines to builtins.
Next step: kill printfs from linux/lib, if __builtins support the same
features (ie, kernel printfs do not have any particular % code).
Anybody knows if gcc2.95.3 has this builtins ?
I think gcc builtins are under-used in kernel...
