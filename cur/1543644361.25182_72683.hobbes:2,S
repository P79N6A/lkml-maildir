We want to make sure the config format is extensible in case we want to 
add Makefile rules or some other metadata (i.e. <driver>.conf contains 
all config/make info needed to build a driver, just drop it in)

Can you elaborate a bit on that?  'make oldconfig' is one of the things 
we want to keep working as-is...  That was a downside of ESR's system. 
If you're saying "silent" as in, if-no-changes-occurred or 
defconfig-copied-as-is, that's cool...
