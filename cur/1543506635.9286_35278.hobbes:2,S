I have added a patch to ip_fragment to check if skb->dev is not NULL
and not equal to skb->dst->dev and if so, use skb-dev instead.  It
also uses the skb->dev->mtu instead of the one from the dst cache.

I am seeing some occasional severe Oopses towards the end of
ip_fragment, either just before, during or just after the call to
output().
I have been using neigh_compat_output() as the output function
parameter to ip_fragment() with this behaviour.  I have also shut off
the NOARP flag to the virtual devices to be able to pass the pointer
to dev_queue_xmit() in the place of neigh_compat_output() to
ip_fragment.  Both mostly work, with, as you describe as 'corrupted
registers'.
I am able to call either of the above-mentioned output funcitions from
t,he end of ipsec_tunnel_start_xmit when we don't need to fragment
without any crashes.  Why?

I will look at them carefully again, IPIP has changed considerably
in 2.2,, merging drivers/net/new_tunnel.c in with net/ipv4/ipip.c.
