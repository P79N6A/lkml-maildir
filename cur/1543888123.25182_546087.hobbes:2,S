    I didn't know about it, probably I didn't install it the last time I
built util-linux. Anyway, I've seen an ionice in
Documentation/block/ioprio.txt (which, BTW, I missed when searching for
information about my problem).

    Not in my proc :?? Perhaps /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio? Mine is 40,
which I think is too high.
    Thanks!
