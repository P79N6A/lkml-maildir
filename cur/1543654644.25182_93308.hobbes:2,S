kexec-tools-1.8 is now available at:
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/kexec-tools-1.8.tar.gz
Dave Hansen has a patch that allows /proc/iomem to export resources
above 4GB which is needed on machines on with > 4GB of RAM.
Changes:
- /proc/iomem is now parsed so the new kernels memory map should be correct.
- initrds are now actually read into memory so they should work, as well.
That should make kexec quite useable.
The syscall:

and the fixes
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/linux-2.5.48.x86kexec-hwfixes.diff
continue to apply to 2.5.50 so I have not updated them.  
The archive is at:

My apologies for not getting this sooner.  Along with the holidays I have been
battling a cold...
