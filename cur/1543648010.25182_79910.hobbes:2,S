Thanks, I'll cip them in the response, but this test sure does make some
kernels unhappy, doesn't it? And the sad truth is that this isn't
artifact, if you get a similar "real load" on the machine the response
will be really unusable in real life.

Sure, it's very like the one I used to generate the results on the web
site, other than I used "version=${filename%.out}" to avoid a cut or sed
process, and I put my redirect after the "done" as "done >>summary.txt" so
I didn't have to put it on every line. Matter of style, and I'm really
lazy about typing anything I don't need to ;-)

I'm going to replace S.D. with the ratio of the median values in the near
future, I find that more useful, since one really bad response can skew
the ratio of average. Of course the other values are there to avoid
confusion, but t makes a nicer number for the "look at one value" folks.
