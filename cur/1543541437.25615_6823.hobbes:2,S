   "yes"
   I'm doing it already (by accident at first)
   A lot of things will be unable to open files >2G in size (like gzip) and
   the superblock will not have the magic bit set for LARGE_FILES (e2fsck
   complaned at the first chance :-))  I'm not sure what will happen if I
   try loading a 2.2 kernel :-( [not likely unless something Real Bad Happens.]
Could you just recompile these utilities with the 2.4 headers and
expect them to start working correctly?
