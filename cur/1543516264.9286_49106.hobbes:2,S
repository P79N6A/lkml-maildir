Well, I'm surprised that 2.3.28 works at all tbh.  I've located the cause
of the problem, which seems to be a multiple freeing of task structures.
The offending code is:
struct dentry *proc_pid_lookup(struct inode *dir, struct dentry * dentry)
{
...
        read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
        task = find_task_by_pid(pid);
        if (task)
                atomic_inc(&mem_map[MAP_NR(task)].count);
        read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
        if (!task)
                goto out;
        inode = proc_pid_make_inode(dir->i_sb, task, PROC_PID_INO);
        free_task_struct(task);
...
}
Unfortunately, there is no use count associated with a task structure,
so the free_task_struct has immediate effect, freeing a (possibly
currently running) task each time you access /proc/self or /proc/<pid>.
It seems to have been introduced into 2.3.27.  Here is a patch which
fixes this:

Are we going to be moving to a use-counted task structure?
