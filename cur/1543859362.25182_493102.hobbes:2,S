Even if the kernel does only reads, you can be in trouble. For
example, the kernel access (by reading) to a data A through the cache
line 1. The application access (by writing a new value) data A through
the cahe line 5. Now it's time to update your frame buffer, so the
kernel access to data A through the cache line 1 which still contains
the _stall_ value.
Note that flushing data  before the kernel access it does not solve
any problems. If the kernel is allowed to write into the frame buffer,
the kernel don't know which line stores the up to date data...

I would say that should be a safe case. Nornally the kernel takes care
to flush caches between context switches (depending on your cache
architecture). But it's only a guess, I haven't checked the code...

Well I'm not the right person to answer this question. I haven't
looked at how Linux handles cache consistency yet. Knowing that I can
give you only 2 recommandations:
    - disable the cache when accessing your frame buffer (kernel and
applications).
    - when mmaping your frame buffer , be sure that the virtual
address returned by
      mmap() to the application shares the same cache lines than the
ones the kernel
      is using.
Hoping it helps,
