lo->sock is only modified under tx_lock (except for SET_SOCK, where the 
device is being initialized, in which case it's impossible for any other 
thread to be accessing the device)
no one else uses lo->file except for the ioctls
I agree that if you really misuse the ioctls you could potentially get 
yourself in trouble with the xmit_timeout (the timer not being deleted 
or initialized properly if you hit the correct window). Taking tx_lock 
would prevent this.
As for other fields, I assume you're talking about blksize, et al. 
Taking tx_lock doesn't prevent you from screwing yourself if you modify 
those while the device is active. You'd need to disallow those ioctls 
when the device is active (check lo->file). Again, this is only going to 
happen if you really misuse the ioctls.
