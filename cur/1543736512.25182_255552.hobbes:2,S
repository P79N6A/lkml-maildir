No, it is NOT tunable. The SunRPC protocol (rfc1831) states clearly that
the AUTH_SYS (a.k.a. AUTH_UNIX) structure is defined as
      struct authsys_parms {
         unsigned int stamp;
         string machinename<255>;
         unsigned int uid;
         unsigned int gid;
         unsigned int gids<16>;
      };
If the BSDs are playing around with that, then they are not adhering to
the protocol, and will be incompatible with all other SunRPC
implementations.
Cheers,
