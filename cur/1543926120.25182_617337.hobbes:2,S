It certainly is. I only experienced that now due to the "too many recipients 
to message" moderation notice that I got from my own message.
Jaroslav -- please disable that junk or if possible, make it a "at most once 
per address per month" thing or somesuch. This is complete crap.

Yes there is. It's necessary for lists that do not have the human and other 
resouces behind it that vger does. alsa-devel was drowning in spam and dying 
as a result back when it was at sourceforge. Upon moving, my preference was 
to ask the lists to be hosted at vger but given that (it seems) Jaroslav 
wanted to keep them locally, moderation was very necessary. I moderate out 
quite a bit of spam every day.
vger is doing an amazing job at spam filtering -- if it's an option to move 
to vger, than sure, no need. But otherwise, the "no need" needs a list admin 
with enough bandwidth and skill.
As to the "new people": it's not optimal, but (upto this thread I'll admit 
-- I woke up to a huge number of posts in the queue) it's not been a _real_ 
problem. alsa-devel is not high-volume enough for it to be.
