In the beginning, backporting hardware support is relatively easy, and 
therefore cherry-picking from mainline 2.6 should be relatively safe.
Things will change as time passes by, but then there's the possibility 
to open the next branch and bring the older branch into a security-fixes 
only mode.

IOW, we should e.g. ensure that today's udev will still work flawlessly 
with kernel 2.6.30 (sic)?
This could work, but it should be officially announced that e.g. a 
userspace running kernel 2.6.15 must work flawlessly with _any_ future 
2.6 kernel.
For how many years do you think we will be able to ensure that this will 
stay true?
