I do understand Alan's objections against this speed measurement code
very well. I have similar code built into other (non-Linux) drivers,
and according to the many user reports that I got the measurement
results should be taken with a grain of salt. It is working perfectly
in most cases, but it may fail from time to time. There is a hidden
assumption in this type of measurement which the device that you run
the test against has to fulfill. If it doesn't (and it is not required
to do to be conforming to the ATA spec), the measurement results (PCI
bus clock) are bogus (typically way too high).
Ciao,
