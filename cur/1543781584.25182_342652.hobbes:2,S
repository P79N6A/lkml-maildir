Sigh. All people adding externs like this should be ...
But it won't change anything - the only difference with
the flag being 0 is to read less fields, but since the function
has been called earlier and the data has not changed
the output is always the same.
Anyways, the correct change is to just remove this call because it's
not needed anymore because of the early CPU detection.

It's not needed for correctness.

Remove obsolete get_cpu_vendor call.
Since early CPU identify is in this information is already available
