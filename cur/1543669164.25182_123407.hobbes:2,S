Here's a [modified] patch that limits kernel log buffer size to 1 MB max
and 4 KB min.
To me, ideally the config system would allow limits to be specified,
and then advanced users could edit .config to get around those limits.
By putting limits checking in kernel source files, there is no way
around them other than by editing the source files.
I've made this patch because there are some cases where it shouldn't be
possible to shoot oneself in the foot IMO -- at least not using the
config system...it's OK to do that when editing .config.
