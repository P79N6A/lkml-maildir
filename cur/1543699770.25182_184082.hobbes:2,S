Doesn't need to be.  It is accessed via libusb these days opening 
/proc/bus/usb/*/*
Emerge (apt-get, etc, as per your distro of choice) something like 
gphoto2 which should include libusb by dependancy and setup hotplug.  If 
you need help with hotplug, buzz me, I have a dc2xx camera I use very often.
