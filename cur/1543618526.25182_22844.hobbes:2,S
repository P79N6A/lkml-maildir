Well I guess it's very mobo-dependent then. What I remember from the VCool
program is that it made windows go crazy on me. I dont know exactly what
happened, just that I removed vcool very quickly.
I just tried the function again, not using vcool, instead *only* enabling
bit 8 of register 0x52 ("Disconnect Enable When STPGNT Detected") with the
following results:
* No other (major) load than Winamp: Minor sound skips
* Winamp when reading from hard disk: Major sound skips
* Winamp when using distributed.net client: Almost no sound skips (one or
two on a 4 minute tune)
* Winamp when using distributed.net & using hard disk: Almost no sound skips
As both the HD controller and soundcard does much DMA, I guess it has some
connection to DMA transfers on the PCI bus?
OS: Windows 2000 Pro
Northbridge: VIA KT133
Southbridge: VIA 686B
CPU: Athlon(B) 1GHz
(Sorry, Linux is running on my BP6)
