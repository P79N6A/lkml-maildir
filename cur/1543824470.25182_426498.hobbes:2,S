I wonder, could this secondary initialization be done by the bootloader?
A standard pc bios don't initialize extra graphichs cards, and making
a custom bios isn't easy.  But the boot loader (lilo/grub) runs in a mode
where calling into a bios should be easy. 
Or will there be a lot of trickery in mapping the secondary (and
tertiary...) card bioses somewhere in order to run them?
