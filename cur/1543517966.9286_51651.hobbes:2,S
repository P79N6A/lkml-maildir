I rechecked and there are no problems in such path. insert_into_queues()
is called only from two places:
1)	getblk
2)	file_buffer
(1) it's always called after the init_buffer, so to generate such a panic
somebody should be doing a getblk(... B_FREE ...) and in such case it's
fine to panic (probably a stack trace would be better though...). But I am
pretty sure this's not what is going on as it's not trivial to do such a
mistake in the filesystem code ;).
(2) is called only from refile_buffer that printk and return if the
bh->b_dev is equal to B_FREE.
So I guess the problem is that the raid patches that you applyed are not
happy if used with 2.2.14pre11 (I'll have a look tomorrow). The official
raid code in the kernel should work just fine instead.
