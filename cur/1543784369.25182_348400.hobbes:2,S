Subject: [GIT PATCH] W1 patches for 2.6.13
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/8/259

Here are some w1 patches that have been in the -mm tree for a while.
They add a new driver, and fix up the netlink logic a lot.  They also
add a crc16 implementation that is needed.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/w1-2.6.git/
or from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/w1-2.6.git/
if it isn't synced up yet.
The full patch series will sent to the linux-kernel mailing lists, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
