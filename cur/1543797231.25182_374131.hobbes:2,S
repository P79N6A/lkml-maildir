I think "Designed for Windows" has the same problem. I know some
hardware that works well with Win98 but no driver exist for XP.
Fortunately that hardware works with Linux...
I would say the fix is "Runs with Linux(tm) 2005-2006" and the
hardware vendor finances maintainance during the specified period.
