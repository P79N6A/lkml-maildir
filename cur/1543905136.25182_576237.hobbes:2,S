Nick,
I have tried your patch with my test case, unfortunately it doesn't
help.
Numbers did vary a little bit more, and it seemed drop_caches was not
working as well as usual (used between the runs).
Also, overall the runs took about .1s more to complete.
Linux 2.6.23-rc1-nick PREEMPT x86_64
Base test:
1st run: 0m9.123s
2nd run: 0m3.565s
3rd run: 0m3.553s
4th run: 0m3.565s
Reading a large file test:
1st run: 0m9.146s
2nd run: 0m3.560s
`/tmp/large_file' -> `/dev/null'
3rd run: 0m19.759s
4th run: 0m3.515s
Copying (using cp) a large file test:
1st run: 0m9.085s
2nd run: 0m3.522s
`/tmp/large_file' -> `/tmp/large_file.copy'
3rd run: 0m9.977s
4th run: 0m3.518s
Anyway, what is the theory behind the patch?
- Eric
