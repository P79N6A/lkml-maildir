I think this is too slow, especially for a busy system, but there are
solutions...

Uh, I think 1. IMPLIES 2.  If it is at the head, it must be closer in
than what the system is waiting for (unless, of course its time has
already passed, but lets not consider that here).

Right, and if the system doesn't have many timers, thus putting this at
the head, it has the time to do the extra work.

I wonder about a more relaxed device timeout semantic that says
something like: wait X + next timer interrupt.  This would cause the
timer insert code to find an entry at least X out and put this timer
just after it.  There are other ways to do this of course.  The question
here is: Would this be worth while?

I don't see the logic here.  Having taken the interrupt, one would tend
to want to do as much as possible, rather than schedule another
interrupt to continue the processing.  Rather, I think you are trying to
say that we can afford to take more interrupts for time keeping.  Still,
I think what we are trying to get with tick less timers is a system that
takes FEWER interrupts, not more.
