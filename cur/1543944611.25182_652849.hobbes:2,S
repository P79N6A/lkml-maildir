Thanks.  The amp values in the codec are indeed set to zero, so this
is the minimal volume level, but the codec chip apparently doesn't
mute the sound.

It's because the master volume is implemented virtually to bind
several mixer volumes together.  The codec chip has no corresponding
functionality.
