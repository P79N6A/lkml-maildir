There are few practical issues we need to be concerned about with new
architectures.
- We don't want to be putting 44000 lines of new code in the kernel and
  then have it rot.  Who will support this in the long-term?  What
  resources are behind it?  IOW: what can you say to convince us that it
  won't rot?
  The lack of a MAINTAINERS entry doesn't inspire confidence..
- How widespread/popular is the blackfin?  Are many devices using it? 
  How old/mature is it?  Is it a new thing or is it near end-of-life?
  It's a cost/benefit thing.  It costs us to add code to the kenrel.  How
  many people would benefit from us doing that?
- Are easy-to-install x86 cross-build packages available?  If not, are
  there straightforward instructions anywhere to guide people in generating
  a cross-build setup?
  <looks>
  OK, blackfin.uclinux.org seems to have that.  Does binutils support
  blackfin?
- A lot of this code appears to come from Analog Devices, but you don't ;)
  We'd need to see some sort of authorisation from the original authors
  for the inclusion of their code.  Preferably in the form of
  Signed-off-by:s.

As I said, 44kloc ;)
- Do you really need to support old_mmap()?
- It would be preferable to use the generic IRQ infrastructure in kernel/irq/
- Too much use of open-coded `volatile'.  The objective should be to have
  zero occurrences in .c files.  And volatile sometimes creates suspicion
  even when it's used in .h files.
- bug: coreb_ioctl() does copy_from_user() and down() inside spinlock.
- err, coreb_ioctl() does down(&file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_sem); but
  that's a mutex now, so I assume that's actually dead code?
