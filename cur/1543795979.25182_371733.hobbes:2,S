Although it isn't obvious in this patch, I request that you don't use
use struct device_driver function methods directly in your drivers but
add suitable function methods in your spi_driver for probe/remove/
shutdown as required, and arrange for the SPI core to convert from
the generic device driver function methods to spi_driver function
methods.
I'm planning to eliminate all the device_driver function methods
entirely - the probe/remove/shutdown methods will eventually be
moved to bus_type.
