I'll work with Martin on that. If Martin decides to move to
netlink/genetlink we could search for some common ground w.r.t to
transfering data to user space, but IMHO its going to be hard, our API
is meant to be used in task context. I think both the statistics
target different use cases (one is device driver oriented and the
other is task oriented)
