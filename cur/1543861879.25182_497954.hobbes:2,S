We have two sets of ATA drivers now, and Intel motherboards support 
bazillion annoying IDE modes, so you will need to provide more info than 
this.
Is the motherboard in combined mode?  native mode?  AHCI or RAID mode?
What driver set did you pick?  is drivers/ide built in, modular, or 
disabled?  is drivers/ata built in, modular, or disabled?
The cannot-find-root-FS errors are definitely caused by driver and/or 
initrd misconfiguration.  The melted flash, I dunno, maybe you managed 
to get two drivers fighting over the same hardware.
