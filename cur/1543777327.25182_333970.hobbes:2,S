right, but the amount of cpu required to do a specific task will also vary 
significantly between CPU families for the same task as well. as long as 
the loops don't get optimized away by the compiler I think you can setup 
some loops to do the same work on each CPU, even if they take 
significantly different amounts of time (as an off-the-wall, obviously 
untested example you could make your 'loop' be a calculation of Pi and for 
the 'audio' test you compute the first 100 digits, for the video test you 
compute the first 1000 digits, and for the X test you compute a random 
number of digits between 10 and 10000)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
