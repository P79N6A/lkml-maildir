The kernel is not a separate task. If you call read() for example, you change 
from user to kernel space, so there can be multiple threads being in kernel 
space at the same time (on SMP+) -- there is no process that is _always_ in 
kernelspace.
task_t *current;
is a pointer to the, well, current process (remember that the kernel is not a 
separate proc!)

Good idea.

p->state == TASK_RUNNING is (AFAI understand) something different than the 
process that _is_ actually running at this very moment.
>since the current->pid is only running
Usually yes. You probably mix 'running' up with "running in the sense of a 
user, not a kernel developer".

A process is the set of all threads with the same
TGID (thread group identifier).

task_t *current;
That one is running.
For SMP, you need a little different variables.

I think there are only kernel threads.
