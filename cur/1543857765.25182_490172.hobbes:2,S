Has anything ever come of this? I would be very much interested in it.
It might make it possible to extend the Siemens Gigaset drivers
(drivers/isdn/gigaset) to the RS232 attached M101 DECT adapter.
There is a working driver out of tree which accesses the serial port
hardware directly (i8250 only), but that kind of thing doesn't seem
fit for inclusion in the kernel.
Thanks
