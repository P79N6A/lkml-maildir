You know, I've seen a lot of mostly-N/A benchmarks, but no real-world
examples. I've seen many folks talking back and forth about data
throughput, but little talk of I/O latency.
Regardless what your unloaded CPU can do, does anyone care to realize
that your CPU usually has to act on the data you're reading/writing from
said filesystem, probably at the expense of throughput?
Now, this is not to say that certain workloads wouldn't benefit
tremendously from compression, especially these days when we seem to
have processor to spare. I may have a giganimonstrous file full of zeros
I just need to read from and write to... I actually remember working
with "Jam drive" (a "Stacker" work-alike) on DOS which really did make
my little 33 Mhz box throw up X-appeal
(
http://www.xtreme.it/xappeal.html
) twice as fast... That was a good
real-world example relevant to me.
Anyway, I guess I'm not arguing for or against anything here. Just
trying to make people realize most of the benchmarks cited do NOT
represent the common scenario.
Also, I would hope that if ext3+compressFS existed I could mount a
compressed ext3 filesystem as vanilla ext3 and gunzip/bunzip2 a file I
know to be compressed to recover the data. Nice to have [back|for]ward
compatibility.
