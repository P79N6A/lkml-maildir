If/when you make this a module, in /etc/conf.modules (it's modules.conf on
mine...  Why in the world was it conf.modules?), don't forget to set the
parameters.  You might wanna read the docs in Documentation/sound.
These are the options that the pas16 driver uses (I'm not sure what a few
are <g>):
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(io,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(irq,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(dma,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(dma16,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(sb_io,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(sb_irq,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(sb_dma,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(sb_dma16,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(joystick,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(symphony,"i");
pas2_card.c:MODULE_PARM(broken_bus_clock,"i");
