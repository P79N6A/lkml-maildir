Ok, this is clearly the end problem -- this isn't a function, it's data.
As to how we got there...  Presuming we got there via a bsr or jsr, the
address is in ra = [<fffffc000040c704>].

The tracelog is suspect -- simple_strtoul doesn't call anything,
though scsi_sleep does call sprintf indirectly.  Further, sprintf
isn't 0x1edc bytes long, only 0x68.
I suppose it is possible that something is wrong with kernel_thread
wrt modules.  An invalid gp would explain much of this wierdness.
But I remember fixing that up way earlier in the 2.1 series, and I
just went back over that call chain and didn't see anything amiss.
Can you point to any particular change from pre7 that causes the problem?
