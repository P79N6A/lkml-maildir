Weird one to me.  Maybe someone else knows...
You were doing this test in an X terminal window, right?
and not on a text-only console?
The reason that I say that is that I can reproduce this problem on
2.5.68, but only in an xterm or similar window, but when I switch back
to a console, the entire device list is displayed.
