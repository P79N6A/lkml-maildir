Probably could, but that's what they asked for. Maybe they don't mean
install kernel, but just running kernel in general. I presume they
don't want to maintain a seperate kernel just for Summit.

please, as far as I'm concerned.

I'll steal Kai's thing from later in this thread.

Yeah, home email is borked for that, sorry. I'll do it properly when I
