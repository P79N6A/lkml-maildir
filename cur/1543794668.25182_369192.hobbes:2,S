I'm glad you agree, but I'm not sure what you mean by "it does not matter".
TIPC wants the user to fill in the pid to use in the nlmsghdr portion of 
a particular message.
When an NPTL child thread uses getpid() to specify the pid, it never 
receives a response to this request.  Running the same code on the 
parent works, and running the same code under Linuxthreads works.
Using gettid() works, but it also means that only the thread that issued 
the request can read the reply.
