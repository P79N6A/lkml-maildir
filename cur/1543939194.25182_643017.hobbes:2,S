Orphaned page might have fs-private metadata, the page is truncated. As
the page hasn't mapping, page migration refuse to migrate the page. It
appears the page is only freed in page reclaim and if zone watermark is
low, the page is never freed, as a result migration always fail. I
thought we could free the metadata so such page can be freed in
migration and make migration more reliable.
