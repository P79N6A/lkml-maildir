Hey there,
I have a very weird thing happening with my Linux router.  I upgraded the
kernel from 2.4.21 to 2.4.22, with almost no configuration changes. Now,
when the machine has been powered on for awhile (about 2 or 3 hours), the
IDE LED will just stay on permanently.  I figured some process was thrashing
or just doing tons of swapping, but using iostat reveals that there's
absolutely no I/O (there's a little every now and then, but not as much as a
solid light on all the time); it makes no difference if I kill off every
single process possible (except kernel and init).  The LED will stay lit
permanently (3 days never went off).  Rebooting the machine fixes the
problem for another 2 or 3 hours until it occurs again.  Reverting back to
kernel 2.4.21 fixes the problem entirely! Right now i've reverted to 2.4.21
as it's annoying not having an IDE LED that "works".
Why would my IDE LED get stuck "on"? I'm not using any non-standard IDE
drivers, just the Uniform IDE driver etc.
Please cc all replies to my email address also.
Thanks,
Tim Carr
