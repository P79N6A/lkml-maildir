This is mostly a bug fix release.
Fixes are all over the place but most important are the fixes to code
range filtering.
Code range filtering is when you select some text in file viewer and
want to view the list of revisions that modified that code range.
Download tarball from 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qgit
or directly from git public repository
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/qgit/qgit.git
Please refer to
