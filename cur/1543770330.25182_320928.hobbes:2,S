Your test works fine on FC4 kernels (which are pretty current),
but it does hit the problem on my vanilla build.  strace output suggests
something is clobbering two registers:
waitid(P_PID, 1740, Sending signal to parent
0xbfc8b198, WEXITED|WSTOPPED|WCONTINUED, NULL) = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGUSR1 (User defined signal 1) @ 0 (0) ---
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
write(1, "Caught signal", 13Caught signal)           = 13
write(1, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
sigreturn()                             = ? (mask now [])
waitid(0x6cc /* P_??? */, 14, 0xbfc8b198, 0, NULL) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
I will look into it further.
Thanks,
Roland
