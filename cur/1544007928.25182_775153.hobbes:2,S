I agree that it not the best example, although it is perfectly possible 
to see this as a controller sub-device. Having the same mechanism to 
talk to any type of hardware involved in video capture and display has 
definite advantages.
Once these patches are in I would definitely recommend that people start 
experimenting with them. Also be aware that this is just the first 
step. I'm going to improve on these two fundamental structs 
(v4l2_device and v4l2_subdev) to add much improved support for 
controls. Currently drivers have to spend way too much effort on 
implementing all the control handling code.
And there are many more things one can do with these structures. I'll 
just take it step by step.
