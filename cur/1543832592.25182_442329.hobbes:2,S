This patch looks wrong since it allows the illegal configuration
ACPI_IBM_DOCK=y, HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI=y/m, ACPI_DOCK=y/m.
If you select something, you have to ensure the dependencies of what you 
are select'ing are fulfilled.
config HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI
	tristate "ACPI PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on ACPI && HOTPLUG_PCI
	depends on !ACPI_IBM_DOCK
	select ACPI_DOCK
	help
