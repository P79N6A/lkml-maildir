Compulsory 1:1 mapping between kobject (thus driver model) and sysfs has
been a constant headache for more complex subsystems (e.g. SAS).  The
organization of internal implementation is directly visible to userland
making it part of API which shouldn't change.  For simpler drivers, this
is fine but for others it's too strict a restriction - internal
representation may have to change as implementation matures and the
desired userland view might differ from internal representation for
multiple reasons.
I'm not saying automatic representation is bad.  It's good enough for
90+% of cases and I'm not intending to change that but we still need
flexibility.
Another example would be libata.  libata currently is a SCSI driver and
as such its sysfs representation is tied to SCSI.  However, it's planned
to become an independent block driver and will thus have a separate
sysfs bus and device representation.  The problem is that such
fundamental structure change takes time but libata still needs sysfs
interface now.  Features which require sysfs interface are currently
being delayed or stuffed into SCSI sysfs interface, both of which are
far from the optimal situation.
Breaking the tight coupling between the driver model and sysfs
representation is a way to achieve that.  sysfs becomes an independent
facility which the driver model uses and, where needed, drivers can
override how it's used.  Breaking the tight coupling also makes the
design and implementation of driver model and sysfs more modular and
simpler.
Less pressing but still important is that the current interface is
needlessly cumbersome.  IMHO, it can be made much more intuitive for
driver writers.  More on this later.

Yeap, it's compatible both ways.  Keeping those intact has been of
course the top priority.  :-)

And the above two are efforts to make life easier for driver writers so
that the overhead of using sysfs is minimal.  Both features don't
interfere with simple usages and when a driver writer wants to use them,
they don't have to do anything special.  They're just there.

Hopefully, it's explained now.  It's part of breaking the tight coupling
between internal driver implementation and userland representation.

The new interface is simpler, more orthogonal and flexible.  The whole
interface is consisted of 11 functions and of the 11 only 9 are needed
to achieve the same functionality the original 16 have.  The left two
are for plugged creation support.
Thanks.
