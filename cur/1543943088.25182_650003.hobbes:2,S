For a long time I was sitting on the patch not sure what to do about
the pound key, but I think we need to allocate separate keycodes for
remote controls and phones that work regardless of users keymap.
Another item is keymap for different devices - the best way to handle
it I think it to implement getkeycodes and setkeycodes methods for
the input device and have alternative keymaps loaded from userspace
instead of adding module parameters.
The rest of the driver looks great and I am sorry I was ignoring it
for so long.
