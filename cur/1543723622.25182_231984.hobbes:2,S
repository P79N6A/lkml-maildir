Right, which is why putting the logic in Parted is the wrong design.

Right.  So this "smart" code has no place in Parted for two reasons:
  1) The best approach varies depending on your kernel.
  2) Parted is not the only tool which needs the Windows-compatible
     geometry.
Parted should do the simplest possible thing.  Allow the user to
specify the geometry, and default it to HDIO_GETGEO (or just
X/255/63).

On a blank disk, yes, I believe so.  Or it tried to parse the CMOS
tables or something.  It may have had some "infer from the partition
table" logic, too...  I never looked at it very carefully.

Because in 2.6, the extended values are obtained by talking directly
to the IDE controller, not the BIOS.  The "raw controller" geometry
happens to match the extended geometry on every system I have seen.
The problem with having the kernel use the BIOS is complexity; in
particular, the complexity of mapping between BIOS disk numbers and
Linux devices.  This task is "impossible" in theory but quite possible
in practice, and becoming more possible all the time (as more BIOSes
support EDD 3.0).  But it is still complicated, which is why the logic
belongs in user space.
