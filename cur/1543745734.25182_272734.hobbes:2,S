Yes. As long as the total rss fits in an int, it doesn't matter if any of
them wrap. Addition is still associative in twos-complement arithmetic 
even in the presense of overflows. 
If you actually want to make it proper standard C, I guess you'd have to 
make the thing unsigned, which gives you the mod-2**n guarantees even if 
somebody were to ever make a non-twos-complement machine.
