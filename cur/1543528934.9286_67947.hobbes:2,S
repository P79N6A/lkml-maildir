If you've got a partial read's worth of data pending, you shouldn't be
sleeping.  If you receive a signal during sleep (because the buffer was
empty when you went to sleep), you should wake up and return -EINTR,
even if the buffer is partially full now.
Well you don't have to do that, but that allows you to avoid this
particular "event lost" bug.
