This sounds supercially at least very similar to the freezes that I am
seeing on a squid box.
At least as far as the freezing/sysrq behaviour anyway.
See my recent postings in linux-kernel for more details, anyway.
However, my freezes are on UP.
I suspect that mine is stable if I compile with gcc-2.7.2. At least I
havent had a crash.
But since its non deterministic, it could be coincidence.
Anyway, I was able to get a full oops log with the IKD patch and a
serial console.
You can find the IKD patch on kernel.org in andreas directory.
I applies cleanly to 2.2.14 and with some fiddling can be applied to
2.2.15pre15.
