This should be easy: the cut-over should be when you're tempted to
rename it 2.6.next. If you have no intention (or hope) of renaming
2.6.x-rc1 to 2.6.x, it is not a "release candidate" by definition.
What's the point? It serves as a signal that a) we're not accepting
more big changes b) we think it's ready for primetime and needs
serious QA c) when 2.6.next gets released, the _exact code_ has gone
through a test cycle and we can have some confidence that there won't
be any nasty 0-day bugs when we go to install 2.6.next on a production
machine.

Please devote some more beer and TV to this problem after you release
2.6.10.
