It seems that you don't understand our goals. Please, look to our web
pages - 
http://www.alsa-project.org
. If you use audio devices only for
consumer use, you probably don't notice anything special.

We don't do this in kernel. We implemented the direct stream mixing in our 
library (userspace). If your applications already uses ALSA APIs or if you 
redirect the OSS ioctls to ALSA library (our aoss library), you can enjoy 
multiple sounds.
Of course, using hardware which can do the hardware mixing is still 
better. It's the same difference like between sw 3D rendering and hw 3D 
rendering.
