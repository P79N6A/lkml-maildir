	I have a idea. Greg asked me to move my display class away from the 
class_device method. One of the nice things about using 
class_device_register is that it handles all the attributes for you :-)
So while going throught the core code for device handling I discovered
that struct device has a struct class. I found it alot easier to have 
class field in the device point to the class you want to use. With 
device registeration the class is setup up for you. 
	The idea was to have the a linked list of classes inside of 
struct device. Then have a way to register/unregister that class with
the device. This way struct device and struct device_driver are per 
hardware but struct class could be used to handle different interfaces
to that same hardware. What do you think? I could do a example with 
hardware that registers a fbdev drivers as well as a backlight. Plus
nobody is using the class field in struct device at this time.
