I think b2c2-flexcop-pci uses a 240K dma buffer, whether you
save a few K in demodulator code doesn't mean much.
The saved memory will be similarly unnoticable to the user as
if you would go and scatter #ifdefs all over tuner-simple.c.
But I'm neither the author nor the maintainer of the b2c2-flexcop
driver, you better ask Patrick if he likes it.
