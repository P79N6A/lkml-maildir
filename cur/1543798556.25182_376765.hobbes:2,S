Subject: drivers/mtd/onenand/: unacceptable stack usage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

In 2.6.15-rc, the following driver was added:
include/linux/mtd/onenand.h:
#define MAX_ONENAND_PAGESIZE        (2048 + 64)
drivers/mtd/onenand/onenand_base.c:
static int onenand_writev_ecc(struct mtd_info *mtd, const struct kvec *vecs,
        unsigned long count, loff_t to, size_t *retlen,
        u_char *eccbuf, struct nand_oobinfo *oobsel)
{
        struct onenand_chip *this = mtd->priv;
        unsigned char buffer[MAX_ONENAND_PAGESIZE], *pbuf;
drivers/mtd/onenand/onenand_bbt.c:
static inline int onenand_memory_bbt (struct mtd_info *mtd, struct nand_bbt_descr *bd)
{
        unsigned char data_buf[MAX_ONENAND_PAGESIZE];
These are variables on the stack that are > 2kB which is not acceptable 
since the complete stack might be only 4kB.
Please either fix this before 2.6.15 or mark the MTD_ONENAND driver as 
BROKEN until it's fixed.
TIA
Adrian
