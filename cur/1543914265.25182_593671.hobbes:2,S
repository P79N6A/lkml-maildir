Yes, I'm sure.  The answer over there was "you don't want to do that.  Do
this instead.

So this is as smooth as producing kernel-source RPM's gets?
I might be better off sticking with a .tar.bz2 and repointing symlinks.

I'm not sure this is going to be any easier to automate, if that's what's
required.

I may just stick them in a bash script and forget about the RPM.  Or are
there other packages that are going to be cranky, dependencywise, if I
ignore the RPM?

On OpenSuSE 10.2, there appears to be:
# find / /home -xdev -ls | egrep -- '-> /usr/src/linux'

Which correct "ones"?  Sometimes pronouns aren't shortcuts :)
Thanks!
