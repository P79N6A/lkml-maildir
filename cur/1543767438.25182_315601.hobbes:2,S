The previous behaviour was a bug that occurred because at the time the
original lease code was written, it was not possible to tell if there were
writers when the read lease was being taken. Further improvements in the
kernel have since made this possible.
The intention of a read lease is to let the holder know is anyone tries to
modify the file.
The current behaviour does not conflict with the man pages on Debian
(although the previous behaviour did not either :-))
