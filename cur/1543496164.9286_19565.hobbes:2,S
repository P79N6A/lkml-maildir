Hmmm.  Tools that magically know how to configure your system are good or
bad depending on what you want and how invasive the magic is.  The magic
needs some information about individual modules to work right, though.
How about defining a "configuration description" language that describes
the module's parameters, and tucking it into a section of the module image
so it doesn't get lost, then letting the userland tools ask the modules
how they can be configured?  The language should probably be structured
text, maybe something like the stuff in isapnp.conf .
This is sort of an in-between topic:  it's kernel-related because it
proposes a modification to how-to-make-a-module, but it's also userland
because the tools will live there.
