yeah, i think that was definitely the case historically.

i think the eye-opener (for me at least) was that there's really a
massive 5%+ size difference here, from 2 simple patches. And meanwhile
Matt is doing truly hard size-reduction work and is mailing patches to
lkml that remove 200-300 bytes of .text, which is 0.01% of code, apiece.
Debloating is like scalability, a piece-by-piece process where we'll
only see the full effects after doing 100 independent steps, but still
we must not ignore the big effects either, nor must we get ourselves
into losing maintainance battles.
The current inline model seems to be a lost battle, the 'size noise'
caused by spurious inlines (which count in the thousands) is _far_
outpowering most of the size reduction efforts. And i think it can be
argued that at least in the -Os case gcc has a very clear directive wrt.
what to do - and much less room to mess up. Independently of how much we
trust it.
