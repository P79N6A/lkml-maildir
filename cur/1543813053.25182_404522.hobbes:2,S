Assigned from what pool?  BIOS most likely sizes the hole to be a pretty
tight fit for all the resources it knows about.  If there is suddenly a
new resource, you're in trouble.
The problem is that we don't know explicitly where or how big the hole is,
how it is allocated (prefetch or non).  Then, even if we *did* know, we
don't know that there's enough space for an arbitrary device to show up
later.
In BIOSes I control we enable the BARs and allocate regions for them and
then turn them off if need be.
There really isn't a good generic answer to this that will work with
existing BIOSes.  My first instinct is to call this a BIOS bug.
We could teach linux about chipsets and let Linux re-do the whole
PCI-allocation process.   But that's not an easy task, and is probably a
contentious idea.
