Well into the nitpicking territory... I think you missed where he  
said "factor 2^16 difference".  So these:
> Going from 32 to 64:   (2^64 - 2^32)
> Going from 16 to 32:   (2^32 - 2^16)
Should actually be these:
Going from 32 to 64:	(2^64 / 2^32)
Going from 16 to 32:	(2^32 / 2^16)
And:
(2^32 / 2^16)^2 = (2^64 / 2^32) => (2^16)^2 = (2^32)
