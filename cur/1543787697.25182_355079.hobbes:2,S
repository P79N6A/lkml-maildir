This is *quite* similar to what I am seeing.

Again, similar to what I see.

This is something puzzling: when I first installed the modules to get
1.25GB, things "worked", but I had problems with memtest86+ (not
memtest86).
I changed things (removing modules), got frustrated having only 512MB on
the system with all the other modules laying around here and put them
back.
This second time, I reduced the latency on the BIOS from 2-2-2 to 3-3-3
and it booted and memtest86+ did't find any errors. Yet, I saw some
corruption, which was what prompted me to send the original mail to
linux-kernel (since I didn't know if it was a hardware or a software
problem, as memtest86+ had not found any errors).
> Try removing the 256MB module?...
Right now, I'm only using one 512MB module, but after I have already
paid for the second one, and it wasn't cheap. :-(
I suspect that the system is stable now, but I am not sure. If I
reinstall some packages with apt, it still gets some problems with the
md5sum signatures of *other* packages, which is highly weird. But I
don't see any other problems.
Puzzling, huh? I already run a SMART offline/long self-test on the disk
(to rule out it being a problem) and it passed with flying colors. I
also already used badblocks on this very disk (but in read-only mode),
and it also didn't find any problems.
I have a Quantum FIREBALLlct15 drive here.
Thanks,
