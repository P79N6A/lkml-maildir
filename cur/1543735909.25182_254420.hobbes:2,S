[A, Snipped from a mail to the BlueZ ppl. B, CC:ed since the last post
 on USB was in the year 2000]
What the bluez developer gathered:
This looks really like an ohci_hcd problem with interrupt URBs.
Controllers and drivers:
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: nVidia Corporation nForce2 USB Controller
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: irq 193, pci mem f8814000
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: USB 2.0 enabled, EHCI 1.00, driver 2004-May-10
ohci_hcd: 2004 Feb 02 USB 1.1 'Open' Host Controller (OHCI) Driver (PCI)
ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.0: nVidia Corporation nForce2 USB Controller
ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.0: irq 177, pci mem f8816000
ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 2
ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.1: nVidia Corporation nForce2 USB Controller (#2)
ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.1: irq 185, pci mem f8818000
ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.1: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 3
And the final error when inserting a USB BT dongle:
usb 1-3.4: new full speed USB device using address 12
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: qh f7e54680 (#0) state 1
hci_usb_intr_rx_submit: hci0 intr rx submit failed urb f7b81274 err -28
from proc/interrupts:
177:          0   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
185:          0   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
193:      24812   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd
CC: Since i'm not subbed to either ml.
Some snipped parts from the original mail.
---
Since some kernel version i can't exactly remember which, i have been
unable to use usb, i have tested with with 2.6.8 -> 2.6.9-rc2-bk7 and i
also applied your patches for 2.6.8.
I have 2 usb dongles, one old that did work once, and one new that seems
to be working like the older but it doesn't work with linux.
Output from hciconfig:
hci0:   Type: USB
        BD Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00 ACL MTU: 0:0  SCO MTU: 0:0
        DOWN
        RX bytes:0 acl:0 sco:0 events:0 errors:0
        TX bytes:0 acl:0 sco:0 commands:0 errors:0
Basically, it just stopped working and i dunno why, any clues? at all?
