Firstly, the kernel does not use System.map at all.  Various user space
utilities use it for reporting and debugging but the kernel only uses
the data in the loaded binary.
Secondly, add this line to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, just after you mount /
in read/write mode.
ln -sf /boot/System.map-`uname -r` /boot/System.map
