Er... if Eric were REALLY going for that, why didn't he use it as an example?
That might actually be a possible real-world situation, whereas all the ones
I've seen so far are so far removed from reality as to be pointless.
Let me put it this way: Requiring Aunt Tillie to configure/compile her kernel
is a *failure* on the part of the vendor. It doesn't matter whether Aunt
Tillie is really Aunt Tillie or your local MSCE. They should not have to do it.
As for adding a driver that's not included in the vendor's kernel, do you
mean that having a Microsoft-trained drone rebuild a kernel specifically for a
certain PC (thus requiring further compilation for any hardware added later)
and including a no-doubt beta driver and then giving it to Aunt Tillie without
any testing beyond the MCSE's PC is a *good* idea?
(I've trimmed the cc line a bit, BTW.)
