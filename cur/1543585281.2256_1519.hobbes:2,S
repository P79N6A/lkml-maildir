Maybe you disabled it in BIOS? My BIOS has option 'assign irq to vga'...

It depends on how much heads you need. If you want more than one head
and all heads need full acceleration, do not go to G400/G450. There
is only one accelerator on them... (well, if you are using all displays
together as one big workplace, you can try it; in that case it has
benefit that both heads share same memory, so you can save some
intersection operations).

USB worked for me until about 2.4.2-ac12 (VIA chipset).
