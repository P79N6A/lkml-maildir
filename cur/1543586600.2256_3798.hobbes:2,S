Never mind. I realized three things:
a) my 53c400 card must be initialized first by DOS driver to be detected by Linux kernel
b) The scanner initialization lasts about 4 minutes. And scanning is very slow
even if I increase the kernel buffer to the max. as described in the SANE doc.
c) Using an adaptec SCSI adapter works just fine: scanner initializes
immediately, card is recognized even without DOS and the scanning is much
faster.
