Paolo (the maintainer) hasn't.  I (the second largest contributor)
hasn't.  I understand why others talk about RTAI and RTLinux forking,
since the _projects_ forked, and the _ideas_ forked, but the _code_
was always separate.  At some point, a person gives up trying to
argue the point, and just says "it forked".  But when you get down
to brass tacks, there was no code fork, because there was never one
code base.
There was some sharing of code in the beginning, typically code that
was sent to the RTLinux mailing list by third parties.  In that case,
the code was copyrighted by the individual.  The fact that it later
showed up in RTLinux as "copyright VJY associates" does not change
the fact that Paolo got it from the original author.

Oh yeah -- I forgot to mention that I was talking about comparing
the original version of RTAI and the contemporary version of RTLinux.
I also checked a number of other combinations, including the last
version of RTLinux that Paolo says that he looked at, and recent
RTAI releases.
I'm not claiming that RTAI is 100% perfect with respect to licensing.
But I have spend many weeks in the past chasing down alleged
plagiarism problems, and I can't find any.  So I'm relatively
certain.
I actually _do_ my research.
