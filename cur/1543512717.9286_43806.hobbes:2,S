I have a similar problem - laptop boots, keyboard freezes - however, it
only happens if pcmcia initialisation runs before gpm starts. If gpm starts
before pcmcia, everything works fine. No hint why (nothing in any log file
suggesting what might be going on).

I have that in 2.2.x (only tried for x=0, 2, 5, 7) and 2.3.y (y <= 19, as I
haven't had time to get 2.3.2[01] yet); with 2.3.1[89], I need to build
pcmcia as a module and make sure it loads after gpm starts, otherwise the
keyboard freezes. With 2.0.z (z >= 35) everything works fine, with gpm
starting before or after pcmcia.
Any configuration which includes pcmcia, ps/2 mouse, and the bits necessary
to boot and mount root fs (ide, ext2, etc) exhibits the same behaviour.
