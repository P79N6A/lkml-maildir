   Ok, I'll try to prototype something that uses data model independent
structures.  Using the kernel headers was convenient, but probably not
advisable.

   Again, I don't think that solves the problem (and there's no ioctl
support in sysfs).  The pointer in the command structure is easy to work
around, nothing uses it and data could easily be stuffed after the
architected entries.  Switching to an ioctl would not solve the problem
of passing ACPI data back and forth.  We don't just want to execute
methods, we want to be able to provide arguments and get data back.
That data is where I see the biggest 32/64 bit issue.  I'll switch to an
evaluate on write model, but I'm not sold that an ioctl would solve
enough problems to be worth it.  Is anyone even open to adding ioctls to
sysfs bin files?  Thanks,
	Alex
