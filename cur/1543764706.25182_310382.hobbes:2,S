I suspect there is no need to do so...

  (*) yeah, yeah, I know about the current theoretical case, and I don't
  care. Not only is it theoretical, the way my objects are packed you'd have
  to not just generate the same SHA1 for it, it would have to _also_ still
  be a valid zlib object _and_ get the header to match the "type + length"  
  of object part. IOW, the object validity checks are actually even stricter
  than just "sha1 matches".
