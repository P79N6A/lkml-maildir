This version is much better and ran stablely.  
If I'm reading the output correctly, the locks are listed by 
their initialization point (function, file and line # that a lock is
initialized).  
That's good information to identify the lock.  
However, it will be more useful if there is information about where the
locking
was initiated from and who was trying to obtain the lock.
