Hi,
just a question: could it be that the inconsistent manner in which
drivers manipulate dev->tbusy flag is related to the problem?
(Some drivers use atomic bitops, others -- as well as the packet scheduler --
access it by plain C language constructs).
Could this result in certain race scenarios where a busy deviceŽs
hard_start_xmit() is called during a tx_timeout condition, the device
cleans up and clears tbusy, but somehow tbusy finally remain set after
hard_start_xmit() returned? (I really donŽt know anthing about
those atomic bitops implementation details and possible hidden gotchas,
thus, feel free to laugh at me if this is total nonsence :-)
