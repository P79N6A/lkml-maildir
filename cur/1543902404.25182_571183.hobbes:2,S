I've recently found (using 2.6.21.4) that configuring a serial ports
(ST16654) which use the 8250 driver using setserial results in the
UART's FIFOs being disabled (unless you specify autoconfig).
The problem is that setserial doesn't fill out xmit_fifo_size when
calling TIOCSSERIAL to set the port type. There doesn't appear to be any
provision to set the port type and have 8250 use the default fifo_size
value for the selected FIFO from uart_config.
The result is that fifo_size remains 0 and the fifo is disabled. So, I
believe that anyone using setserial to configure a serial port (unless
autoconfig is used) will have very poor serial port performance (I did,
thats how I ran across this).
I haven't been able to think of a cure all solution without introducing
some pretty nasty changes. You could argue that setserial should set
xmit_fifo_size, but it seems unnecessary to require a user level program
to have knowledge of the FIFO sizes for all of the different UARTS. I'm
going to change my copy of 8250.c to always use fifo_size from
uart_config, but some people may not find this acceptable.
Maybe I'm missing something here, but I wanted to bring it up in case
its actually affecting other people.
