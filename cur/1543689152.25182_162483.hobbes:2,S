Most users are more than happy to provide additional information when asked
for it. In my personal experience, the documented bug reporting procdure is
a time consuming way of producing lots of information, most of which is
irrelevant to the case in question, and which is usually lacking the
information _I_ am looking for. For me, it tends to be less work to ask the
user for the specific details than to sift through a lengthy standard bug
report looking for it. YMMV, of course.
