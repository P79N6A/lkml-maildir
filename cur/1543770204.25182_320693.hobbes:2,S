Groovy.

Not specialized at all.  I do one pull at a time, so git-pull-script 
suffices with a simple addition to call git-resolve-script with the 
branch as $4, and a simple addition to git-resolve-script to add 'branch 
$foo' to merge_msg.  See attached (note the patch includes my earlier 
'optimization' patch).
On this last run, I actually just ignored git-pull-script and simply ran 
git-resolve-script -- since all my objects are in-tree already, I don't 
need the fetch step:
git-resolve-script $(cat .git/HEAD ) $(cat .git/refs/heads/amd8111) \
    /spare/repo/netdev-2.6 amd8111
