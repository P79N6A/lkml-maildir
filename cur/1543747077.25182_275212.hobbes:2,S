Starting with 2.6.10-rc1, date and time on my old APM-based
laptop is messed up after a resume. Specifically, Emacs and
xclock both make a huge forward leap and then stop updating
their current time displays.
The cause is the "jiffies += sleep_length * HZ;" addition
to arch/i386/kernel/time.c:time_resume() which is in conflict
with the hwlock --hctosys that the APM daemon normally does
at resume.
Preventing apmd from updating the system time does eliminate
the problems I described, but this requires kernel-version
dependent settings in user-space, which is ugly and fragile.
Just FYI. I don't have a nice solution yet.
