This is caused by Gerd Knorr's bttv driver update. The problem is:
drivers/media/video/bttv-cards.c uses
  extern int mod_firmware_load(const char *fn, char **fp);
mod_firmware_load is in drivers/sound/sound_firmware.c but since your
sound is completely modular it's not in the kernel.
Workarounds (untested):
Either compile the bt848 driver modular or compile the sound supprt
statically into your kernel (the driver for your sound card can stay
modular).
Gerd:
If you want to use mod_firmware_load in drivers/media/video/bttv-cards.c
you must make this driver depend on CONFIG_SOUND (IIRC there was a
similar problem reported by someone who's bt848 driver was modular but
CONFIG_SOUND was completely unset which resulted in a depmod error).
