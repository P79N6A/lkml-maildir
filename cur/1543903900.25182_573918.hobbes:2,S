The net effect would be same. Why would you choose one over other
(do_sys_poll vs. do_poll)?
Can you point me to code where socket read returns in case of
signal_pending? I need to try couple of things.

The try_to_freeze() is needed so that the process doesn't block the
freezing
of tasks (it is supposed to call refrigerator() as soon as reasonably
possible
when freezing(current) is true).
Alternatively, we might return 0 from do_sys_poll() if do_poll() has
returned 0 and both signal_pending(current) and freezing(current) are
true.  Below is a patch that implements that.  Could you please try it?
Greetings,
Rafael
