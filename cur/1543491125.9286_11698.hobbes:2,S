I keep getting these errors on a fairly regular basis.  So far, I've
only had to reboot (ah, the Windows solution!) a few times, but I'm
starting to get a little worried.  Especially since I've disabled the
Disconnect feature in the SCSI BIOS.

and so on
host 0 is my hard drive, /dev/sda.  I've also got a CD and CD-R on
there, the CD-R is on scsi1.  Any ideas what causes this and how to fix
it?
