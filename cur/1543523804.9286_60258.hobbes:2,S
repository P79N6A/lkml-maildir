sgi has written a special patch that measures the lock
contention:
oss.sgi.com/projects/lockmeter
Another problem with the lock granularity is the use of
cli() instead of a private spinlock in many drivers,
although most of them are not performance critical.
[e.g. the complete ISDN subsystem].
Please note that fine grained locks are sometimes slower
that one big lock under realistic loads, e.g. I removed
the per-semaphore array spinlocks from the SysV code
because it was 5% slower than the simple lock.
