   I dislike the "__HAVE_ARCH_xxx" approach, and considering that most
   architectures will probably want to do something specific anyway I
   wonder if we should get rid of that and just make architectures
   have their own code.
Most software-based TLB refill systems could (and sparc64 will) make
all ref/mod bit updates occur in the kernel software fault path so
that none of this special synchronization is necessary.
In such cases it might be nice to have a generic version that all such
ports can share by just not defining __HAVE_ARCH_xxx.
Sure it's a bit ugly, but it does allow code sharing, so it probably
at least deserves a chance :-)
