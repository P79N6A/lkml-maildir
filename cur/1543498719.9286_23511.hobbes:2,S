Why litter the kernel with messages? Why not just add error interpretation
to some external daemon - sysklogd is an excellent place to do that. It
would simply parse all kerenel messages looking for, say
"kernel: kerror 00 at 0x0000:0x0000"
then look it up in some erorr database and output the translated message -
and even localized one if you will. Less kernel space, more convenience for
users, and no more such longish discussions as this one. I would gladly code
it, if there was consent it's a good approach.

If put in the kernel, yes, but in the userland?
