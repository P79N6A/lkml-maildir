Subject: 2.6.18-rc5-git3: compilation failure on numa-q

It seems that between 2.6.18-rc5-git2 and -git3 some of our test systems
stopped compiling the kernel; the two I have investigated appear to be
Numa-Q systems, x86 smp.  They are failing as below:

    [PATCH] i386: Remove alternative_smp
    The .fill causes miscompilations with some binutils version.
    Instead just patch the lock prefix in the lock constructs. That is the
    majority of the cost and should be good enough.

Tried backing this out and the compile failure seems to go away.
Ok, having stared at it for a bit it seems the attached patch fixes it
up.  But as its asm could someone cast an eye over it.

    fix up rwlocks following alternative_smp removal
    
    We seem to be getting compile errors in reader-write lock support
    on x86 SMP following the removal of the alternative_smp in commit
    8c74932779fc6f61b4c30145863a17125c1a296c:

    We seem to have lost some ':'s in the conversion, and the UP alternative
    has not been removed in some cases.  I think we want something like the
    below.
