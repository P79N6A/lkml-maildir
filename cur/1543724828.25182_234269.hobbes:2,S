So what?  NULL must have an integral type in C++.  void* is explicitly
forbidding in the C++ Standard.
I don't see that NULL is discouraged in C++.  It's mostly redundant,
like it is in C, and it's not safe for varargs even on machines where
NULL pointers are represented can be zero-initialized, because
pointers to members and regular pointers don't even have the same
size, unlike C, that doesn't have pointers to members and thus can
safely use (intptr_t)0 for NULL and it will even work for varargs
(given the considerations above).
