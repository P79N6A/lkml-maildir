Hi,
   1. After I compile the driver , If I insert the module I am getting
    following warning:
    ./cardtest.o: kernel-module version mismatch
	./cardtest.o was compiled for kernel version 2.2.5-15
	while this kernel is version 2.2.5-22.
   cardtest is name of module to be inserted.
    what needs to be done to this?
  2. After inserting the module should I have it in /proc/modules.
     b'coz /proc/modules has modules which are loaded and the usage
     count of the module can be looked from /proc/modules.
     so when I insert a module(cardtest) should I get it in /proc/modules?
