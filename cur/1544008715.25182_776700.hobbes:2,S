I understand what the semantics are supposed to be.
But I'm getting a headache trying to see if I really understand the code.

Correct.

I think that's right too.

Seems like it would be cleaner to reorganize the code a little.
reparent_thread has only one caller.  How about we move:
	if (p->pdeath_signal)
		/* We already hold the tasklist_lock here.  */
		group_send_sig_info(p->pdeath_signal, SEND_SIG_NOINFO, p);
	list_move_tail(&p->sibling, &p->real_parent->children);
into forget_original_parent and rename reparent_thread to something else,
called only:
	if (!task_detached(p) && !same_thread_group(p->real_parent, father))
		orphaned_process(p);
Thanks,
Roland
