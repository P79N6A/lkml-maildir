AFAICT, if you're in a softirq it can't change.  If you're not, there's
no limit anyway.

But ulterior motive is to push the kthread primitives by making as much
code depend on it as possible 8)

I'm trying to catch them as new ones get introduced.  If the name is
old-style, then there's little point changing (at least for 2.6).
From now on, I'm being more vigilant 8)

You can screw your machine up with RT tasks, yes.  This is no new problem,
I think.

Depends on the neatness of the code, I think...
