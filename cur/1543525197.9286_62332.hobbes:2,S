the problem andrea was trying to address is that there is no impedance to
cache growth on large memory hardware.  letting the caches grow until they
compete with each other for physical memory works well on small memory
hardware.  but on large memory hardware, large caches pollute the CPU
caches during searches, actually slowing the system down.
a fixed limit is probably not the ultimate answer.  but somehow the caches
need other forces on them to keep them sized reasonably.
