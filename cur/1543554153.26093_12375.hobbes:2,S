Alan, do you consider it as a bugfix if I tell you
that
we can't get anymore oops with the new bonding code,
even in SMP ?
I've had reports of it working very well, and faster,
for a long time now and the link detection seems
completely OK now. I'd like to specially thank
Constantine Gavrilov for all the tests he has done and
the time he spent in enhancing the documentation.
Please find the patch against 2.2.18pre20 in
attachment, in case you agree.
Regards,
Willy
