Why do all the rio tools insist on doing raw port inb/outb's?
We have this nice parport layer for sharing parallel ports between devices,
and the rio of all things is extremely likely to be connected in parallel with
other devices like plip or lp. This would also solve the problem of the
user-space process being preempted and not being ready when needed to service
the port.
Ideally i should be able to connect the rio to the cable and ls /mnt/rio
without interfering with my plip connection.
