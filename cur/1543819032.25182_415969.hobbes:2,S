In order to scan for migratable pages through the page table and in order 
to guarantee the existence of the anon vma.

COW f.e. results in sharing.
Hmmm.. But I see the point the "optimization" causes an inconsistency 
between anon and file backed pages. For anon pages we need to do this 
polling. I had prior unoptimized version that modified lookup_swap_cache 
to handle migration entries. Maybe we better undo the optimization.
