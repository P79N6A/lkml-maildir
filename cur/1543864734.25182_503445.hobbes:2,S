What was the commit that introduced the change? ... I have a vague
memory of it being deliberate.

Erm, but the corollary is that if we get a large read failure because of
a bad track, you're going to try and chunk up it a sector at a time
forcing an individual error for each sector is going to annoy some
people ... particularly removable medium ones which return this error if
the medium isn't present ... Are you sure this is really what we want to
do?

The sense key may have come with additional information  I think we want
to parse that (if it exists) rather than just blindly failing the first
sector of the request.

This would drop through to the UNIT_ATTENTION case if scsi_end_request()
fails ... I don't think that's correct.
