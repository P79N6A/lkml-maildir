BK can happily be used as a patch management system and it can, and has
for years, been able to accept and generate traditional patches.  Linus
could maintain the source in a BK tree and make it available as both
a BK tree and traditional patches.  It's a one line command to generate
a release patch and another one line command to generate the release
tarball.
By the way, you can send BK patches exactly the way that you send regular
patches, with the difference being that BK has an optional way of wrapping
them up in uuencode (or whatever) so that mailers don't stomp on them.
