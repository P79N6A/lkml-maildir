There are two bugs in the via_dsp_release function for this sound driver.
The first is just a typo, that prevents it from suppressing "via_audio: 
ignoring drain playback error -512" errors.  
The other bug (which I don't know the correct way to fix) in this same 
area is the "via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11", which is 
caused when the via_dsp_drain_playback is called with nonblock != 0, and 
the function returns -EAGAIN.  Setting nonblock to zero certainly 
supresses the error, but I'm not sure what the dangers of blocking in the 
release function would be when an application specifically requests non-
blocking.  Ignoring this error as with -ERESTARTSYS is also possible (and 
would cause no more harm than currently happens).
Both bugs are pretty minor, I was just getting annoyed with my logfiles filling up with useless messages.
