An old problem has re-appeared since I have done this,
On a soft-reboot ('reboot / shutdown -r now') the kernel
stops on its way back up stating
Socket Status 0x0000003
(or something similar)
and it then requires a hard-reset to clear.
This only seems to be under the 3c59x code / more-so the vortex module.
Any help would be appreciated.
Cheers,
