rather than add all that extraneous dreck to the Kconfig files, i
*really* wish folks would give serious thought to my earlier
suggestion about a "maturity level" attribute that could be used to
not only add a parenthesized maturity level during display, but could
also be used to activate/deactivate entire levels in one operation.
there's no point adding all that redundant content when it can all be
done automatically.
