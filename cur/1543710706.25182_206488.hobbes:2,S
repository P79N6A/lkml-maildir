You could also have some sort of 'hidden symlink', i.e. something that
behaves just like a file but is in fact a link to some other
filesystem.  If that other filesystem is not accessable, all
operations return -EIO.
Not sure if this is a sane solution, but it would make my cow-stuff
work across filesystems as well.
