Darn it.  I don't seem to know how to get -fno-stack-protector to
work.  I ran:
export CFLAGS=-fno-stack-protector
make mrproper
cp ../.config .
make oldconfig
CFLAGS=-fno-stack-protector make all install modules modules_install
But I am still getting the errors.  Anyone know what I am doing wrong?
Thanks,
