I have reproduced it on a quad core test system.
With 4 threads (on 4 cores) I get a high throughput, with
approximately 58% user time and 42% system time.
With 8 threads (on 4 cores) I get way lower throughput,
with 37% user time, 29% system time 35% idle time!
The maximum time taken per query also increases from
0.0096s to 0.5273s. Ouch!
I don't know if this is MySQL, glibc or Linux kernel,
but something strange is going on...
