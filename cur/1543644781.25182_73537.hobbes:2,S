There isn't really any. You can do 
	define_bool CONFIG_KALLSYMS y
for two releases and hope to propagate it into people's .config before 
making it an actual choice in config.in.
Or you can hack something up like
if [ "$CONFIG_KALLSYMS" = "" ]; then
	define_bool CONFIG_KALLSYMS y
fi
bool 'kallsyms' CONFIG_KALLSYMS
which gives the desired effect in make oldconfig, but may magically break 
make xconfig or so.
So no, just hope for people to read the help text and enable it.
