Hello,
I've found a problem in the select() call. The manpage states:
"those in writefds will be watched to see if a write will not block"
I've tried a select() for write against a closed tcp socket (closed by
the other side), and the select call _blocks_.
Any write() call to that socket will _not block_, and will return with EPIPE.
I've seen this happening in 2.4.20 and 2.6.16.29 (xen patched) at least.
Maybe it's a glibc problem - you may know better.
Could you please keep me in carbon copy? I'm not sure I want to
subscribe to LKML.
Regards,
Lluís.
