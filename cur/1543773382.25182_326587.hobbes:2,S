Yes, we have Mantis as own bugtracking system:
	
https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/
I fully agree with Dave.  There are too many bugzillas, and developers
can't cover all of them, too.
It'd be nice if these (exported) bugzilla systems can notify to the
corresponding devel ML, e.g. alsa-devel in the case of ALSA, so that
the reports surely reach to developers.
