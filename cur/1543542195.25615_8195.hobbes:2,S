I agree.  I only commented becuase the orginal question asked about
this and I thought "couldn't hurt to try and see if it makes a
difference.
What I think the "real issue" is (and was addressed by the rest of the
patch but possibly wasn't presented very clearly) is the following:
1/ request for block A arrives.  We have no spare requests so we
   sleep.
2/ request for block B arrives (B continguous with A). We have no
   spare requests so we sleep.
3/ something completes, first thread is woken up and it uses the
   request.
4/ something else completes, second thread is woken up.  Now it's
   request for block B could be merged with the request for block A,
   but it doesn't bother, it just adds a new request.
This seemed to be what was happening the the trace given.  
If two threads, say kupdate and kflushd are both running
flush_dirty_buffers, and the buffers are in device-sequential order,
then we would have them alternately writing sequential blocks.
One the request queue was full, each would block waiting for a
request, and then fail to merge with the request that was just
scheduled by the other. 
Net result - lots of small write requests on the queue that could be
merged but aren't.
Hence the code in my patch that went back and tried again to merge
requests after waiting for a request structure.

I think that providing every opportunity to merge requests is taken
(see above), there shouldn't be any problems with "only one free
request" situations.  The queue is (should be) sufficiently long to
decouple handling of requests off the front from adding new requests to
the end.  A bunch of read requests should all have a chance of getting
onto the queue and being merged where appropriate before any of them
get processed.  If not, then MAX_READAHEAD is too large, or
QUEUE_NR_REQUESTS is too small (or we need to get the READA command
down to ll_rw_block from generic_file_readahead).
