Indeed. While I use Linux extensively, I also use FreeBSD. Frankly,
Unless 2.4 (which I admit I have not tested yet) changes lot about the
network setup, FreeBSD is probably faster than Linux for serving up
webpages (Based on a good mix of perl cgi scripts, php, static pages,
and flash(large files)). I would like to see Linux aproach the
performance levels I've seen from FreeBSD, but remember too, that the
*BSD codes are 30 years old. Thats given them substantial time to work
out glitches in things like this.
