Is this strictly true though?  The ABI for Power and x86 are not 
necessarily dependent on each other.  One could just as easily define a 
typedef like:
#if defined(__ppc__)
typedef uint64_t guest_handle_t;
#elif defined(__x86__)
typedef unsigned long guest_handle_t;
#endif
I thought the use of GUEST_HANDLE was to maintain type safety.  It 
certainly helps the issue you point out but it's not strictly necessary.
IMHO, this trick makes the code pretty ugly.  I'd rather see it 
disappear in favor of something more akin to the above.
