I tried the patch below, but it didn't work. Nothing (or very little)
was swapped out to disk. I also tried using GFP_KERNEL, but that
seemed to cause a deadlock. (Maybe it would have gone OOM if I had
waited long enough). I think the problem is that pdflush and friends
are already frozen when this code runs.
