I was in fact thinking of IDE not VGA :)
Let's keep it simple.
Just need to make sure that, if we use an enable-by-PCI-BAR bitmap, it 
is still possible to let the driver make decisions about enable/disable 
of the IO and MMIO bits.  You could have a PCI BAR bitmap and then two 
additional "don't touch <xxx>" bits, for example.
