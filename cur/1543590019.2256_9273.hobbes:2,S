It happens here also, but it does not seem to be a pump issue:
- I am using dhcpcd  ;)
- DHCP with 2.4.3 works fine
- The packages sent by the DHCP-server are having the correct destination
  MAC, but 'tcpdump' on the RTL8139 machine does not see them unless the
  promiscous mode ist enabled. When putting the NIC into promiscous mode,
  DHCP works fine[1].
- After the DHCP info are fetched and the IP is set, the promiscous mode
  can be turned off.
- When setting the IP statically things are working without turning on
  promiscous mode
