	Hi LKML,
I've got a code for 2.4 which do:
================================================================
spin_lock_irqsave(&runqueue_lock, flags)
for_each_process(p)
{
	// modify p attributes
}
spin_unlock_irqrestore(&runqueue_lock, flags)
================================================================
and I need to translate it to 2.6.
What is exactly the best solution since runqueues are per cpu now ?
Is there a way to lock and browse each runqueues ?
or if not, is tasklist_lock can be use to lock all runqueues at once ?
and one another question, what is the difference between
local_irq_disable() and local_irq_save() ?
irq_save push eflags register on the stack, but why for ?
Thanks for any comments.
