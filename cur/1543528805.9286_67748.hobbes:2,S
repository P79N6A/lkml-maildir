Yep: back in  the glorious AT times IBM did a lot of  stupid things like
using interrupts Intel  had reserved  for future hardware  for BIOS irqs
(IIRC Intel originally  had reserved all IRQs below 32  for the PIC) and
decided to  use IRQ  13 for  floating point  error reporting  instead of
exception  16. We  are obviously  smarter than  IBM because  we use  the
exception,  but  unfortunately  IRQ  13  is hardwired  to  the  FPU  for
compatibility, so we can not use it for other purposes...
