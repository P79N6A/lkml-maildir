"mov" shouldn't generate the 0x66 prefix, at least with the assembler
since binutils 2.14.90.0.4 20030523. The assembler in CVS won't generate
0x66 for "movw" either.

Suggesting "mov" instead of "movw" is for the existing assemblers. Or
kernel can check assembler version to decide if "movw" should be used.
I can verify the first Linux assembler which won't generate 0x66 for
"movw".

We are fixing those issues in assembler. If people run into problems
like that with gas, they can report them. They will be fixed.

Kernel has
	unsigned gsindex;
	asm volatile("movl %%gs,%0" : "=g" (gsindex));
	...
	if (gsindex)
		
It is OK if gcc never generates memory access like
	movl %gs,0x128(%rsp)
Otherwise, the upper bits in gsindex are undefined. The new
assembler will make sure that it won't happen.
