Huh?  It was just an L440GX, which was probably the single most common PC
server board for a while in 1999-2000.  Most of VA Linux's systems used
them.  I wouldn't call them "very specialized."

Their 'TOCS00' paper lists a 29us one-way latency on page 22.
Click looks interesting, much more so then most academic network projects,
but I'm still not sure if it'd really be useful in most "real"
environments.  It looks too flexible for most people to manage.  It'd be
an interesting addition to my test lab, though :-).
