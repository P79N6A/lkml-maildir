memcpy() is pretty creative, too.  If you want something really dumb and
robust, you should probably create an inline:
/*
 * Eric sez: his code path need something simple and stupid, that
 * will work every time, especially when things are messed up
 * elsewhere.
 */
static inline void braindead_copy_page(void *dst, void *src)
{
	unsigned long ctr = PAGE_SIZE >> 2;
	asm volatile("cld; rep; movsl"
			: "+D" (dst), "+S" (src), "+c" (ctr)
			: : "memory");
}
(FWIW, the "cld" is supposed to be redundant, as DF=0 is supposed to be
guaranteed by the ABI.)
