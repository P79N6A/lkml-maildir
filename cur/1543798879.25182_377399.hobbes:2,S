Unfortunately I don't have a date stamp for these messages.  I think
they might be from my initial efforts to debug the problem - I deleted
some lock files once or twice.  None of the other machines had these

OK, I did that and unmounted and remounted the home directories.
There's still no lockd process.  I had someone using kde log in, and the
login hung for a couple of minutes but then proceeded - it didn't do
that before.  There were no kernel messages.
