If Ray wants to fix things, it's just fine with me.

For a start, so far there has been no reason whatsoever to change the
format of definitions.

So far you have only been irritating developers for no reason. What I
asked you to do is to NOT change whatever config options developers
developers felt were necessary to introduce. If you want to change the
format of the config.in files go ahead. Messing around with the config
options themselves is *not* for you to do, nor are you to impose a
more restrictive space for people to work in.
