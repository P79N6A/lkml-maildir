Hello All
                I totally agree with all of you, but my idea behind
this patch is that administrator/root user must be able to know that
there is fork bombing attack on his machine and he should be able take
action agianst that particular user and kill all his processes.
can anybody please tell me how can we achive this??
Regards
Anand
