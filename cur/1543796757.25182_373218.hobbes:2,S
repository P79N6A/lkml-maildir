For people to think that the kernel developers are just "too dumb" to
make a stable kernel api (and yes, I've had people accuse me of this
many times to my face[1]) shows a total lack of understanding as to
_why_ we change the in-kernel api all the time.  Please see
Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt for details on this.

[1] My usual response is, "If we are so dumb, why are you using the kernel
    made by us?", which usually stops the conversation right there.
