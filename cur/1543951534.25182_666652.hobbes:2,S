On (11/03/08 21:12), Hugh Dickins didst pronounce:

Well spotted, but I have one query below.

While it is clear you are setting the mask to include HIGHMEM-related flags,
it's not as clear to me why you alter the zonelist as well. target_zone was
already based on HIGHMEM so what are you fixing there?
It should still work as ->node_zonelists[0] is a zonelist suitable for node
fallback as opposed to node_zonelists[1] which is for GFP_THISNODE but
maybe this was not quite what you intended?
Probably something obvious that will hit me the second I push send :)
