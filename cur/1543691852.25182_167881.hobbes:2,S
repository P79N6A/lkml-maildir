Also, some TCP implementations sometimes don't align the timestamp
options in the headers as well.
Also, as I mentioned, try IP over appletalk.
Unaligned accesses are perfectly normal, _especially_ in the kernel.
This is an axiom of the kernel networking decided a long time ago, and
printing out a silly message when it happens doesn't make that any
less true.
