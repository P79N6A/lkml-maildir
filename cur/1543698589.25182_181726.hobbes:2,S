Upon reading the man page on lilo.conf again I realized that was the
wrong map, but was hoping there was some notation that'd allow for maps
other than "/boot/System.map" for the multiple kernels.
Ok, I've tried rdev and file, is there a "cleaner" way of getting a
kernel version other than:
{0}:/usr/share/doc/lire>strings /boot/vmlinuz-2.6 | grep -i 2.[46] | head
2.6.0-test11-bk2 (root@wally) #3 SMP Thu Dec 4 12:41:42 EST 2003

Yes it's functional, I can live with it, just wondering if theres a
"better" way for when I'm updating servers at work and have no idea what
kernels are in /boot on the machine (some have been up longer than the
year+ I've been here).
