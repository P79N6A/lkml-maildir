I have found the bug - the call to tty->driver.set_termios in
change_termios() was removed, therefore serial port speed was not set
correctly.  I sent patches fixing this to Jason Baron and to LKML:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/7/105
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/7/106
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/7/107
But I did not get any reply.
