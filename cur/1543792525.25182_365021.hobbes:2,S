No, a publically available spec for the hardware is what makes the
difference.  Those drivers which are reverse engineered, or which have
only partially open specs are the ones which bit-rot the fastest.  
For example, I've got a webcam which I've never been able to make work
properly due to the PWC driver and the lack of documentation from
Philips on the chipset.  Even with heroic efforts by others, it's just
hard to do.  
But if we have docs, we could support this camera until the end of
time, as long as people were interested in supporting it.
