	Fixed in the mega "memory-leak" patch that I sent to Jeff a
few days ago :

	This is very yucky. The memory leak is easy to fix, but the
dandling reference is *very* serious. And I don't see how to fix that
without either changing the behaviour of skb_padto or the semantic of
the xmit API.
	Alan, would you mind thinking 2sec about this one ?
	Thanks...
