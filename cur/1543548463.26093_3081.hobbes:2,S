Looks ok, however:
 - please use unified diffs. Standard context diffs are horrible.
 - Please split this up the same way the checksums were split up:
   make the xor routine be an architecture-dependent library thing, with
   the "generic" slow one possibly just a regular library thing.
There's no reason to have alpha code in drivers/block. Just move it into
arch/alpha/lib, etc, please?
You've done most of the work already, that last 1% would clean things up
noticeably, and you could get rid of the ugly "Makefile knows architecture
rules" stuff.
