I reported this problem almost a month ago (in 2.2.10-ac11).  As
near as I can tell, it's fixed--both 2.2.11 and 2.2.12-final work
on my LX164 + 53C875.  
The problem wasn't with the 53C8xx driver, per se, but rather with
the PCI windows (which were setup at one location but accessed at another)
Most other drivers didn't tickle this bug, but the 53C8xx drivers did.
If you're continuing to have problems, then there is probably a different
issue involved.
