I've been able to run a range of 2.4 and 2.6 kernels compiled with -O1 and
without any -O flag at all, and with all "extern inline" changed to "static
inline". It doesn't seem to be a problem on i386, x86_64, frv (which I'm
trying to add) and am33 (which I haven't tried to add yet).
When debugging, -O2 makes for a real problem because, amongst other
inconvenient things, it enables the explicit parallelisation features that frv
cpus support.
Would you object to making it possible for the arch to override the
optimisation level when debugging?
