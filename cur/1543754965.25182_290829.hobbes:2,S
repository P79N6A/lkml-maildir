lots better already! Some more comments (now that the patch got a lot
easier to read :)
 static inline __u32 tcp_v4_init_sequence(struct sock *sk, struct
sk_buff *skb)
 {
-       return secure_tcp_sequence_number(skb->nh.iph->daddr,
-                                         skb->nh.iph->saddr,
-                                         skb->h.th->dest,
-                                         skb->h.th->source);
+
+               return ip_randomisn();
 }
is there a reason for the weird indentation?
+       if (!tp->write_seq) {
+                       tp->write_seq = ip_randomisn();
+       }
spare { } pare that's not needed, also looks like one tab too many
as for obsd_get_random_long().. would it be possible to use the
get_random_int() function from the patches I posted the other day? They
use the existing random.c infrastructure instead of making a copy...
I still don't understand why you need a obsd_rand.c and can't use the
normal random.c
  
 static inline u32 xprt_alloc_xid(struct rpc_xprt *xprt)
 {
-       return xprt->xid++;
+       /* Return randomized xprt->xid instead of prt->xid++ */
+       return (u32) obsd_get_random_long();
+
 }
 
that cast looks quite redundant...
