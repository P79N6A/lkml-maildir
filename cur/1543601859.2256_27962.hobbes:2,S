I just sent you some replies...
I know, and I am working on it.  You are one of the few people reporting
any problems, and the only one with problems like this.  This is not to
say `its you' but just that it is making it hard to figure out, but I am
trying.
I have a boatload of emails to respond to, and most of them were sent
just to me and not CC the list so people just have to wait for me.
I don't get paid to do this, and there are only so many hours until my
girlfriend gets mad :)
