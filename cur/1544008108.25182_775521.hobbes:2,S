Som information that would be useful:
- did you run "e2fsck -f" to see if there were any errors in the filesystem?
- do you run any specific applications that seem to trigger the problem
  (e.g.  Vuze (formerly azureus) as was reported by another user)
- do the applications writing to this file have any unusual IO pattern
  (e.g. mmap IO, lots of write+truncate+write on the same file, etc)
We discussed the creation of a debugging patch to help diagnose this
problem.  It looks like you have already compiled your own kernel, so
I assume it would be possible for you to run with an additional patch?
Cheers, Andreas
