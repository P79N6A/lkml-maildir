hi list,
i tried to compile linux 2.6.0 unfortunaly the
GNU assembler version 2.11.90.0.8 (alpha-redhat-linux) using BFD version 2.11.90.0.8
has a problem:
  AS      usr/initramfs_data.o
usr/initramfs_data.S: Assembler messages:
usr/initramfs_data.S:2: Error: Unknown pseudo-op:  `.incbin'
make[1]: *** [usr/initramfs_data.o] Fehler 1
I solved that with an upgrade to
GNU assembler version 2.13 (alphaev56-unknown-linux-gnu) using BFD version 2.13
there is already a check for as < 2.7 perhaps checking for <2.13 would be better :)
