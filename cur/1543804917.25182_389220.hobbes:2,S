Heinz, 
If you really want the rest of us to convert from md to lvm, you should
perhaps give some attention to thee brittle userland (scripts and and
binaries).
It is very tedious to have to debug a production system for a few hours in
order to get the rootfs mounted after each kernel update. 
The lvm error messages give almost no clue on the problem. 
Worse yet, problem reports on these issues are completely ignored on the lvm
mailing list, even when a patch is attached.
(See

http://linux.msede.com/lvm_mlist/archive/2001/06/0271.html
 for reference.)
Such experience gives an impression lvm is not yet ready for serious
production use.
No offense intended, lvm kernel (lvm1 nor lvm2) code has never given me
trouble, and is probably as solid as anything.

PS: Speaking of debugging failing initrd init scripts; it would be nice if
the kernel gave an error message on wrong initrd format rather than silently
failing... Yes, I forgot to make the cpio with the "-H newc" option :-/.
