Sure - though I guess it's Linus or Andrew who will have to do
the holding.
I sent it off contingent on the approval of yourself, Hawkes and Nick.
It looks like Linus is living dangerously and put it in already without
your approval. Hawkes reports of the oops if we didn't do something was
definitely motivating us to try something.
Good luck with your fix.  Let us know when you understand it.
I'm not quite sure how close Linus is to releasing 2.6.13, or
what would best serve his needs here.  The best I can do is push
on, be transparent, and let Linus holler if he has a better idea.
