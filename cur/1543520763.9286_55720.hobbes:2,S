When you did this, did you have CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD as m, y, or is not
set?  If you have SD as m or y, that may have interfered with your set
up.

I've appended my configuration file for 2.2.13 which works for me.
Hopefully it will give you some help or suggestions.

There may be some interactions between ide cd support and ide scsi
support when both are available at the same time.  I've handled this a
couple of different ways.  
The first option involved compiling ide cd, ide scsi, and all the scsi
support as modular.  In this case I insmod ide cd support and both the
ide cdrom and cd rw drive function as normal ide devices.  The cdrom
gets seen as hdc and the cdrw drive is seen as hdd.  If I need to write
a cd I rmmod the ide cd support and insmod the ide scsi subsystem.  In
this case the ide cd drive gets seen as scd0 and the cd rw drive gets
seen as scd1.  
I've since rejected that in favor of the second option.  In this case I
disable ide cd support entirely.  Again, the cdrom drive is seen as scd0
and the cdrw is seen as scd1.  Everything gets compiled in as
monolithic, and I avoid the necessity of insmod/rmmod.  Symlinks for
/dev/cdrom and /dev/cdrw have to be adjusted accordingly, however.  
In neither case were the hdc=ide-cd or hdd=ide-scsi lines needed in
lilo.conf.
