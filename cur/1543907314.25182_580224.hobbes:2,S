The 32bit EFI code doesn't know this yet, does it?

That doesn't sound good. Is this really supposed to work this way?
If the raw hardware works why are we using EFI services at all? 
We generally trust hardware more than BIOSes.
Might we end up with machines that only boot with the 64bit kernel?
Will systems have a dual EFI implementation? 
Also long term I would like to use a few useful EFI services,
like the support to put some data into the CMOS area to survive
a reboot. That would be quite useful for panics and oopses.
But we would prefer to have that on 32bit too.
