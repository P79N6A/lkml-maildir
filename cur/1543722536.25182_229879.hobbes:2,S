The LED stuff looks good (few minor comments below), but the ACPI table
info should be moved to the ACPI core to provide this to all ACPI tables
in the /sys/firmware/acpi tree.

This should just be a pointer, not the whole structure.  Then just set
it to whatever pointer is passed to you from the module.

Why lock here?  What could race?
And why the irqsave lock?

Again, why lock?  And why copy the whole structure?  And it's on the
stack, which isn't very nice.  Same comment applies to the get_
function.

Why change the value based on the return value of the call?  This
shouldn't be set at all.
