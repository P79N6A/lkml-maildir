Hi!
I'm not really sure if this is a regression or if I simply hit a hardware 
problem.
After some time of work (mostly hours sometimes minutes) my system will freeze 
including Blinking LED's and unresponsiveness on SysRQ, but I finally got 
this using netconsole:
CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
Bank 4: b200000000070f0f
Kernel panic - not syncing: CPU context corrupt
I Also keep getting ext3 errors about reading or writing in wrong zones.
Will now have a - this means many - run of memtest.
