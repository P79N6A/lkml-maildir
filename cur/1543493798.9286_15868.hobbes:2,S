0xc0000 is in the ISA memory space.  This area is special in that (on PC 
machines at least) you can access it without ioremap, and in fact ioremap will 
just return the original address.  It's still good practice to use ioremap for 
this sort of memory though.  The example of writing is to a different memory 
area for which ioremap is always needed.

That's correct, though you can get away with just dereferencing a pointer 
under some circumstances on some architectures.
