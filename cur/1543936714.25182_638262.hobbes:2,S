The Coverity checker spotted the following NULL dereference introduced 
by commit cf0594625083111ae522496dc1c256f7476939c2:
<--  snip  -->
...
struct hfs_btree *hfs_btree_open(struct super_block *sb, u32 id, btree_keycmp keycmp)
{
...
        if (!tree->inode)
                goto free_tree;
...
 free_tree:
        tree->inode->i_mapping->a_ops = &hfs_aops;
...
<--  snip  -->

       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
