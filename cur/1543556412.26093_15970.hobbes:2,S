Hi,
	Back in September, David Howells sent in a one-line patch that just
exported
access_process_vm. It doesn't seem to have been applied, and there was no
discussion of it. 
Was it simply overlooked, or was there a good reason not to apply it and no
one
ever replied to the list about it? 
I'm dragging some checkpointing code into the Wonderful World of Linux 2.4,
and it'd
be great if I could chuck all the scary
walk-the-page-tables-and-hope-it-works
code that's currently in there with more modern stuff. 
Thanks!

This was the original message: (I can re-create the "patch" against the
current
release, but it seemed straight-forward enough :)

Could you please apply this little patch to export access_process_vm()?
Cheers,
David Howells
