the reference on the chipset driver should only be bumped when
/dev/agpgart is open()'d, but currently that isn't the case.

The reference counting has been horked since the 'new' module loader
appeared[*], and never got fixed as I've nearly always found something
more important to work on, and it's not really a problem for 99%
of users.  If someone found the time to write a patch to make it do the 
right thing though, I'd be happy to merge it as long as it's done
correctly.

even made the problem worse.
