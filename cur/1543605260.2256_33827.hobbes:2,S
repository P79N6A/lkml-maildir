But that has nothing to do with stockholders claiming ownership of code
written by an employee. That's a much deeper policy. So your assertions
are way off base.
Now, if your driver just interfaces your hardware with userspace, then
that driver likely contains nothing of extreme importance for how your
"Bomb Scanner" works, and releasing it under GPL is not going to be a
problem. Your application contains those details. I don't see how you
are getting at the application level being considered a corrupter of the
kernel's GPL stringency. Do you actually see this occuring?
