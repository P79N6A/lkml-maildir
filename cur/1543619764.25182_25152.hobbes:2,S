However, those aren't the main failure modes you need to be concerned 
with.  Antenna effects may actually be your biggest problem -- picking 
up deterministic signals from other parts of the system.
However, I believe this is a solved problem.  It would definitely be 
interesting taking rngd and figuring out a way to drive it from /dev/dsp 
-- probably not too difficult a modification.
