compared to v22 & that of 2.6.23
cfs of v2.6.23 was quite "nice" with some great stuttering - dunno why
the best besides current was v19.1 or v19.2 (sound stuttering was a
little stronger I think but desktop "feeling" was definitely better
than v22 and that of 2.6.23)  if I recall right 2.6.21 + cfs backport
/ cfs patch
