Please explain your statement "before the feature hit mainline in 
v2.6.16" in the above sentence of you in a reasonable way other than 
that it should say I knew about it before the feature hit mainline.

Perhaps for you.
For me it's not irrelevant what I'm publically being accused of.
And it's not the first time in the thread that you use things that are 
objectively not true in accusations against me.

I found the bug.
I repeatedly told about this bug on linux-kernel.
I explained to you who claimed just yesterday "my experience was that 
it had effects." why it couldn't have possibly worked (no matter why 
your experience was differently).
And now you start big flames against me why I hadn't stated more boldly 
that this patch never worked.
Not against Arjan who seems to have sent a patch that never worked.
Not against Harvey who independently spotted the same bug.
Not against the people who didn't care when I said on linux-kernel that 
it didn't work (one of the threads even had CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING in 
the subject).
Thanks a lot, Mr. Molnar.
