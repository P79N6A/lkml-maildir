Does not help , now I get on top the other errors :
/work/crazy/VBox/stable/virtualbox/src/VirtualBox-1.5.2_OSE/include/iprt/types.h:121: error: redefinition of typedef 'bool'
/lib/modules/2.6.23-gcfa76f02/build/include/linux/types.h:33: error: previous declaration of 'bool' was here
...
/*
 * C doesn't have bool.
 */
#ifndef __cplusplus
# if defined(__GNUC__)
#  if defined(RT_OS_LINUX) && __GNUC__ < 3
typedef uint8_t bool;
#  else
#   if defined(RT_OS_DARWIN) && defined(_STDBOOL_H)
#    undef bool
#   endif
typedef _Bool bool; <- line 121
#  endif
# else
typedef unsigned char bool;
# endif
# ifndef true
#  define true  (1)
# endif
# ifndef false
#  define false (0)
# endif
#endif
Looking at include/iprt/types.h that has already #include <linux/types.h>.
