Hi,

   The right answer is "export all the information to user space and
let the user choose the naming scheme he likes". For example, I'd
prefer identifying my two (hypothetical) USB mice with identical
serial numbers by position in the bus topology and the other
devices having sane serial numbers by the serial numbers.
				Have a nice fortnight
