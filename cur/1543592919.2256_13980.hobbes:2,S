Just a blind guess, but this reminds me of a similar problem I had with 
a different Athlon board a while ago. The BIOS and the driver disagreed
on the bits through which DMA capability was signalled. The fix that worked
for me was to enable both IDE channels (and use up two interrupts) though
I needed only the first channel.
