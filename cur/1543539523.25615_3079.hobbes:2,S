Stephen, Andre is actually referring to a valid class of exploits there (there 
are valid exploits to /bin/bash).
An old example was putting shellcode in a long pathname, creating a symlink to it 
and tricking root to cd into it.  But that's not the specific style he's 
referring to obviously - that style usually lets you trigger off a shell script
and through that achieve the creation of a SUID root shell.
I'm just not sure exactly what he means by "shellstack memory push".  Certainly not
a term I recall coming across, and in fact reputable security references and
search engines return no match.
David.
