The traffic on sites like www.microsoft.com, www.kernel.org or I'd say
even www.bkbits.net isn't distinguishable from a DDoS Synflood on a
regular day. A bazillion of different IP addresses from all over the
net trying to establish a TCP connection at the same time. And the
other sides are dog-slow modem/isdn/dsl connections which means high
latency, low bandwith, many retransmits and still they're legal
connections that you want to serve.
Forget it. You can't compare your homegrown ISDN/DSL line with the
traffic of a serious internet service. If you try, you get burned.
