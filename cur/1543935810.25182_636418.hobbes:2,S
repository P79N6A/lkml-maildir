According to Phoenix Technologies book "System BIOS for IBM PCs,
Compatibles and EISA Computers, 2nd Edition", the I/O port list gives
port 0080h   R/W  Extra page register (temporary storage)
Despite looking, I've never seen it documented anywhere else, but I
believe it works on just about every PC platform.  Except, apparently,
my laptop.
