Ahhh..what I said was wrong. :)

I hadn't been thinking about the class of programs you're talking
about.  I'm more into `music machines', and I've written one
(www.hyperreal.org/~est/oolaboola) that gives me acceptable (1/50th
second) latency even on 100 HZ linux.  But rtlinux does offer the
ability to replace other types of audio hardware.  Best of all, under
rtlinux my stuff and your stuff can both run. :)
Best,
Eric
