I know what you mean and that is why I already proposed a radical
solution. Let me repeat it:
 - convert all files from the previous charset to UTF-8 overnight
   if the previous charset was unknown, first make sure that you can
   guess it for all users and contact users that have files with
   suspicous filenames (eg. not convertable from Latin1). Or look trough
   their shell/X config files (*)
 - in libc, implement a recoding function to convert file names from
   LC_CTYPE to the underlying UTF-8 encoding
Done.
(*) There is no other way. Linux developers ignored the diversity of
charset/encodings over many years and now the needed information is lost
(not stored anywhere in the filesystem)

Of course. That is what the conversion shoudl be done in Userspace
(libc). The kernel itself does not know about used locale.

It is the _right_ enconding in the moment when they create it.

Yup, I know that problem. At least to display them correctly, you can
either run unicode_start (to enable console's own conversion) which
sucks when they are chars from completely different language groups, eg.
latin and cyrillic. I used dynafont for a while which worked well for
displaying characters.

No. TERM does not have anything to do with locales (LANG).
