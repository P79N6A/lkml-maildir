Hmm.
Looking better -
I'm in the process of configuring v2.4.3..
It looks as if the TUN/TAP selection isn't being grok'd right.
It should be available as a module, yet the 'm' is greyed out and
not selectable.  I don't see any prerequistes in the drivers/net/rules.cml
either, although i'm not exactly proficient at reading these yet..
if the functionality of tun/tap as a module has been removed, perhaps the
help text should also be updated, but CML1 does allow me to select it as
a module..
As far as the colors go, it never really bothers me, although my color-blind
friend my have some input -- but he's out sick with pink-eye.
(okay, not pink-eye, but that just sounded funny for a color-blind person)
