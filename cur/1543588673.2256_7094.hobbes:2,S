No. The page cache is used as the IO synchronization point, both for
swapping and for regular IO. You have to add the page in _first_, because
otherwise you may end up doing multiple IO's from different pages.
The proper fix is to do the equivalent of this on all the lookup paths
that want a valid page:
	if (!PageUptodate(page)) {
		lock_page(page);
		if (PageUptodate(page)) {
			unlock_page(page);
			return 0;
		}
		rw_swap_page(page, 0);
		wait_on_page(page);
		if (!PageUptodate(page))
			return -EIO;
	}
	return 0;
This is the whole point of the "uptodate" flag, and for all I know we may
already do all of this (it's certainly the normal setup).
Note how we do NOT block on write-backs in the above: the page will be
up-to-date from the bery beginning (it had _better_ be, it's hard to write
back a swap page that isn't up-to-date ;).
The above is how all the file paths work.
