You can mark it as NEW, and then check that bit-position on the
three bitmaps.

Ho stop, of course if the kernel notices that fd 1234 has read data
available, this fd isn't returned to the user without checking that
the user has marked fd 1234 in the read-availability.

I would then prefer to go with the API that the digital guys suggested
in: 
http://www.cs.rice.edu/~gaurav/papers/usenix99.ps
#define EVENT_READ   0x01
#define EVENT_WRITE  0x02
#define EVENT_EXCEPT 0x03
typedef struct {
  int fd;
  unsigned mask;
} event_descr_t;
int declare_interest (int fd, int interestmask, int *statemask);
int get_next_event (int array_max, event_descr_t *ev_array, struct timeval *timeout);
If you want, you can then simulate select in the library. 
	int  select(int  n,  fd_set  *readfds,  fd_set  *writefds,
			fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout) 
	{
It should just pass on the call to the system call for small nmax.
	if (n < 256) 
		return sys_select (n, readfds, writefds, exceptfds, timeout);
When nmax goes above a certain threshold, it will become viable to
compare an old cached version of the arrays to the current one,
register the differences with declare_interest, and then empty the
event queue. (For the example, I'll work bit_wise, but the actual
implementation will work with a long at a time.)
        for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
	  if ((FD_ISSET(i, stored_readfds) != FD_ISSET(i, readfds)) ||
	      (FD_ISSET(i, stored_writefds) != FD_ISSET(i, writefds)) ||
	      (FD_ISSET(i, stored_exceptfds) != FD_ISSET(i, exceptfds))) {
              declare_interest (i, FD_ISSET(i, readfds)?EVENT_READ:0 |
                                   FD_ISSET(i, writefds)?EVENT_WRITE:0 |
                                   FD_ISSET(i, exceptfds)?EVENT_EXCEPT:0);
          }
        }
        memcpy (stored_readfds, readfds, n/8);
        memcpy (stored_writefds, writefds, n/8);
        memcpy (stored_exceptfds, exceptfds, n/8);
        memset (readfds, 0, n/8);
        memset (writefds, 0, n/8);
        memset (exceptfds, 0, n/8);
        rv = get_next_event (ARR_SIZE, ev_arr, timeout);
        if (rv <= 0) return rv;
        n = 0;
        do {
          for (i=0;i<rv;i++) {
            if (ev_arr[i].mask & EVENT_READ)   {n++;FD_SET (ev_arr[i].fd, read_fds);}
            if (ev_arr[i].mask & EVENT_WRITE)  {n++;FD_SET (ev_arr[i].fd, write_fds);}
            if (ev_arr[i].mask & EVENT_EXCEPT) {n++;FD_SET (ev_arr[i].fd, except_fds);}
          }
          rv = get_next_event (ARR_SIZE, ev_arr, timeout);
        } while rv > 0;
        return n;
This completes the "userlevel" emulation of "select". This will
perform quite well for many applications (ones that don't change half
the "large" set between each select call).
                   Roger.
