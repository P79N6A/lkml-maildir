On the second point I think you're mistaken; see
	
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fcntl.html
	"Since implementation of full deadlock detection is not
	always feasible, the [EDEADLK] error was made optional."
The third objection is the one that concerns me most, and is the one I'd
like to understand better.  So I'd be interested in any evidence of
applications that do actually depend on the current behavior.  (Even
hypothetical use cases might be interesting.)  I'm also curious what
other OS's do.

That's an interesting idea.  The flag might not help as much, since
looking for a cycle in the graph of blocked requests may be more
difficult in the case where we don't know whether the graph is acyclic
to start out with.  (But I don't know--I haven't thought about it much.)
