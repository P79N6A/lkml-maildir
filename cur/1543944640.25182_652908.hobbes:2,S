I've fixed BOARD_ATSTK1002_SW2_CUSTOM, thanks. It was a real bug.
As for AP7000_8_BIT_SMC, it is sort-of used. It is part of a choice
menu where the other two choices are used like this:
#if defined(CONFIG_AP700X_32_BIT_SMC)
...
#elif defined(CONFIG_AP700X_16_BIT_SMC)
...
#else
...
#endif
and the #else block covers the only remaining choice, AP700X_8_BIT_SMC.
I can fix it by turning the #else above into an #elif I guess.
