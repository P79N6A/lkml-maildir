That's exactly what surprised me. He rejected complete patch and accepted something incomplete
and broken.

I thought changes like that are always discussed on the lkml. They are directly related to the 
new module interface changes. It least CC lkml.
(I've subscribed to netdev list)
The latest patches that I've seen from you on netdev list and in main BK tree still don't 
handle accept() properly
net/socket.c:sys_accept()
        ...
        if (!(newsock = sock_alloc())) 
                goto out_put;
        newsock->type = sock->type;
        newsock->ops = sock->ops;
         ...
newsock is not accounted for (sock_alloc() doesn't bump module refcount).

Ok. This is wrong. Which should be clear from reading the thread that I mentioned.
Owner of the net_proto_family is not necessarily the owner of the 'struct sock'.
Example: af_inet module registers net_proto_family but udp module owns the socket.
(not that IPv4 code is modular but just an example). Another example would be Bluetooth.
We have Bluetooth core that registers Bluetooth proto_family and several modules
that handle specific protocols (l2cap, rfcomm, etc).
Also net_proto_family has pretty much nothing to do with the struct sock. The only reason 
we would want to hold reference to the module is if the module has replaced default 
callbacks (i.e. sk->data_ready(), etc).
So my point is we need sk->owner field. 
I'd also prefer to see sock->owner which gives more flexibility (i.e. net_proto_family can 
be unregistered while struct socket still exist, etc). 
net_family_get/put() makes no sense net_proto_family has only one function npf->create() 
which is referenced only from net/socket.c. struct socket should inherit owner field from
struct net_proto_family by default but protocol should be able to assign ownership to a 
different module if it needs to.
So I'd suggest reverting the patches that went in and applying my patch instead. Not because 
its mine but because IMO it's a better starting point. Dave, comments ?
Thanks
Max
