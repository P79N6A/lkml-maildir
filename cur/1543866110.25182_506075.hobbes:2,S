We don't cope okay with the power going out, at all.  And as an user case, a
need for fsck if you do something that is a reasonable use case (unplugging
devices while suspended) is not okay, either.

Well, if we add *move* events for when someone unplugs a usb stick in one
port and replugs it in another while the system is in lala-land... maybe :-)
It would be normal to do it, when dealing with docks.
