Where are not handling IO from user space but we are synchronizing those
materials with a kind of automation...
And all our tasks ( video capture and analysis, commands and data from and
to VTR and Video server, GUI refresh and more ) should be done within 20 ms,
that is why we needed and installed RTL.
I should have precised that obviously all of our code is not in the kernel.
And not to be insulting : what an useful answer U made ... ;op
However thank you for having began this thread...
Best regards
Matthieu
