Subject: EDAC: unable to reserve PCI region

I don't know anything about how EDAC works, but this doesn't look
right. I would not have expected a PCI memory reservation to fail if
everything was set up right.
EDAC MC: Ver: 2.0.0 Jun  6 2006
EDAC i82875p: i82875p init one
PCI: Unable to reserve mem region #1:1000@fecf0000 for device 0000:00:06.0
EDAC MC0: Giving out device to "i82875p_edac" i82875p: PCI 0000:00:00.0
using 2.6.17
I don't have a device 0000:00:06.0 in /sys/bus/pci/devices either.
Shouldn't there be an entry there if I have this hardware?
Looks like my EDAC isn't functioning, I used have entries for it in sysfs.
