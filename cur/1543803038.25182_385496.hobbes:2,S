Please don't send multiple patches under the same Subject:.  Please try to
choose nice names for each email, as per
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt,
 thanks.

It's best to not refer to an email thread in this manner - the covering
description for a patch should be a self-contained standalone thing which
contains all necessary info to understand the patch.
Could you remind us what problems this patch series solves?  It _appears_
to solve statfs reporting.  Does it fix anything else?  There have been a
couple of reports of filesystems outright failing on >2TB devices - does it
address those problems, if so how?
