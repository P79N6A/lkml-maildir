Oh, Good Job - BKL is evil.  And I think that is partly evident in the
resulting code, and I have a couple comments about it.
I suspect the recursive nature of the BKL (and perhaps the locking rules
such that you don't always hold alock, i.e. if name is not NULL) are
responsible for:
	if (!locked)
		spin_lock(&acct_lock);
which really isn't the prettiest or safest thing, although I don't
actually see any problems with it here.  With the BKL removed, it may be
better to rewrite the code in a cleaner and saner way.
I'd much rather see sane locking rules where we knew the callers and
each function entry clearly either held or does not hold the spin_lock. 
Make sure we don't call anything holding the lock, et cetera ...
Also, I like the struct but the defines are a bit ugly.  Why not just
s/acct_lock/acct_globals.lock/, for example, in the code?  Or Just call
the instance of the struct "acct" and have acct.lock, etc.
In other words, good job, but this is a development kernel - rip some of
this cruft up and make it perfect, no?
