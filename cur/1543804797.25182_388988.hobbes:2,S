I can't really comment on the quality of the linux sendfile() implementation,
I've never looked at the code.  However, a couple of general observations.
The seek storm happens because linux is trying to be "fair," where fair
means no one process get to starve another for I/O bandwidth.
The fastest way to transfer 100 100M files would be to send them one at a
time.  The 99th person in line of course would percieve this as a very poor
implementation.  The current sendfile implementation seems to live at the
other end of the extream.
It is possible to come up with a compromise behavior by limiting the
number of concurrent sendfiles running, and the maximum size they are
allowed to send in one squirt.
Thanks,
Jim
