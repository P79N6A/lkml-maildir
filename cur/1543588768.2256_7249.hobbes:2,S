Subject: [Semi-OT] Dual Athlon support in kernel

Would the current state of athlon support be considered stable?
I've got a colleague interested in getting a dual athlon box, and
I'll be making the decision as to what hardware to purchase.  I'm
wondering is dual Athlon viable for a business solution right
now, or is it considered "experimental"?
What hardware would be recommended for a dual CPU system that
needs to be fairly rock solid?  Should I recommend to stay with
the P-III Xeon?  Or something else?  What issues would I expect
to have to deal with if going with a dual Athlon?
Also, what is a good rock solid SCSI RAID controller?  Money is
no object.  Reliability, performance and Linux compatibility are
though.
Chipsets to avoid?
Any experiences/info good/bad would be greatly appreciated.
