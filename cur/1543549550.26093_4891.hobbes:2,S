Ok, compiling using a cvs of X i got a couple hours ago,  I'm just
wondering what the average segment number is for SHM on an X session
that has been up for a while ....  i'll get back with any sort of info
on if the SHM problem has been solved with this latest CVS or if it
continues to look like a kernel SHM problem.  So far though,
2.4.0-test8-vm3 is handling the problem Quite well as opposed to test9,
which died in 2 hours upon booting ...and it didn't have the added
stress of compiling X.
