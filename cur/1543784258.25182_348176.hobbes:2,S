There are a few bugs which I'd identified as arising from the acpi tree
while it was in -mm.  Is this patch likely to drag them into mainline?
They include:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4977
            Summary: ACPI 20050708 fails on HP RX2600 platform
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4867
            Summary: bug in ACPI crashes machine when reading
                     /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4980
            Summary: krash on entering mem sleep
Plus we have all the battery monitor woes, but they're in 2.6.13 already.
Thanks.
