I frankly doubt that avoiding breakage was considered in any way... So
much is changed without visible gain, I'm still trying to identify what
wonderful new capability was gained by doing the change at all.
That said, since the new stuff is different, the change of extension is
probably a good thing, since it clearly prevents someone from dropping a
2.4 module into the tree without a clue that things have changed. That's
not a problem, other than it breaking mkinitrd, a module utility still
notably missing from the module_init stuff.
