I have not yet tested later versions, but 2.4-test5 corrupts my jpegs.  I
made an iso image and mounted it in loopback and they are corrupted;  it
is not loopback doing it, I burned a CD and they were corrupted the same
way.  I downgraded to 2.2.18 and that works fine.
If this is a known problem and/or has been addressed, great.  If not, please
ping me and I'll try the latest 2.4 test and see if the problem has gone 
away.
