I must be weird or something, but I often think about this and the sheer 
number of clock cycles executing at any one time around the world. Have 
you ever stopped to think how many copies of schedule() (or whatever) 
are currently running somewhere in the world? It's just nuts :-)
More seriously, if nobody cared about this stuff then we wouldn't have 
all this MCE reporting and tools to handle differentiating between 
actual failing DRAMs and temporary bit transitions in ECC memory.
