You have a wide choice of oopses, watchdogs and hangs available.
Basically the device vanishes and in some cases we end up stuck in a
tight loop with the old IDE layer trying to get to talk to it and then
die in an NMI watchdog.
If you are interested in the actual dumps let me know. I'll need to clear
it with originator of the reports.
