It seems that the error lies in the following piece of code from 
drivers/net/tulip/interrupt.c, function tulip_interrupt. I've inserted 
an additional printk after the "if (status & 0x8000)" and it looks like 
normal operation of the nic is considered as an major error by the 
driver because my printk appeared in dmesg output right after bringing 
the interface up. I assume that the else branch is never executed 
although I didn't test what happens if an transmit error really happens. 
I wonder if a fix for this problem consists of just changing the value 
of the AND mask but I have no idea what the right value would be.
   if (status & 0x8000) {
           /* There was an major error, log it. */
#ifndef final_version
           if (tulip_debug > 1)
              printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: Transmit error, Tx status %8.8x.\n",
                        dev->name, status);
#endif
           tp->stats.tx_errors++;
           if (status & 0x4104) tp->stats.tx_aborted_errors++;
           if (status & 0x0C00) tp->stats.tx_carrier_errors++;
           if (status & 0x0200) tp->stats.tx_window_errors++;
           if (status & 0x0002) tp->stats.tx_fifo_errors++;
           if ((status & 0x0080) && tp->full_duplex == 0)
                   tp->stats.tx_heartbeat_errors++;
   } else {
           tp->stats.tx_bytes +=
                   tp->tx_buffers[entry].skb->len;
           tp->stats.collisions += (status >> 3) & 15;
           tp->stats.tx_packets++;
   }
