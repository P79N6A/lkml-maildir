We have not tried to implement LRO in the core networking code.
Today, the available API for a driver to pass packets up is 
netif_receive_skb/netif_rx.
Our implementation coalesces pages, then gets a skb to point at the 
pages and passes it up to the stack.
LRO in the core networking code would require adding methods to pass up 
data segments in addition to skbs.
HW might also be able to assist LRO by identifying the session an 
incoming packet belongs to,
thus avoiding the session lookup. The API should also allow for the 
driver to indicate such info.
Cheers,
Divy
