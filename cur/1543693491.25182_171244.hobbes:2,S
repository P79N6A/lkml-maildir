Seven atomic ops in a row, isn't that rather inefficient?
The 2.6 version clears those PG_flags all together in one
non-atomic op - but elsewhere, in prep_new_page.
Is there an actual test case for why 2.4 now needs this change?
If there's something trying to lock random pages, of course it would
be needed; or should that something be taking a reference instead?
