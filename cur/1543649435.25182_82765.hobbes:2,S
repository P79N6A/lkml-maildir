There is a third way, described in the original Banga/Mogul/Druschel
paper, available via Dan Kegel's web site: extend the accept() call to 
return whether an event has already happened on that FD.  That way you 
can service a ready FD without reading /dev/epoll or calling
sigtimedwait, and you don't have to waste a read() call on the socket
only to find out you got EAGAIN.
Of course, this changes the accept API, which is another matter.  But
if we're talking a new API then there's no problem.
