NACK, it's very similar to the cd "$HOME" (or ulimit calls) done by the
login mechanism, except for the fact that no shell does implement a
setnamespace command and therefore can't leave that namespace. If the
shell were actually modified to implement setnamespace, that command would
be exactly like the cd command.
The wrapper I mentioned will usurally not be needed for normal operation,
but if users want additional private namespaces, they'll need this
seperate wrapper (or to modify the application or the shell) in order to
switch into them.

The mount would be a part of the current namespace, which is shared across
all current user processes unless they are started without login (e.g.
procmail[0]) or running in a different namespace (the user called
setnamespace).
[0] If you want procmail in a user namespace, use a wrapper like
---/usr/bin/procmail---
#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/setnamespace /users/"$UID" -- /usr/bin/procmail.bin "$@"
---
BTW: I think the namespaces will need the normal file permissions.
