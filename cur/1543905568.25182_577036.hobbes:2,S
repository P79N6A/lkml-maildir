Ok, making such a record would be good, if possible. I did see that the
"author" field for git commits can have only one entry, unfortunately,
and it turns out "Signed-off-by" and "Acked-by" have other meanings
attached that have to do with the patch-journey-from-author-to-you chain.
But I'd like these to be somehow marked as jointly authored, definitely.
