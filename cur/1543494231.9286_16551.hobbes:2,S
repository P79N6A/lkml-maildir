IMHO we need a way to make all sound apps network transparent.
Unfortunately many popular apps don't support any of the above systems.
This could be changed by providing a sound library (ALSA?) and rewriting
all apps to use the lib rather than accessing the sound devices directly.
Then the lib can contain code to redirect the sound calls over the
network, using one of the above systems.
I don't have the time to work on such a project...
