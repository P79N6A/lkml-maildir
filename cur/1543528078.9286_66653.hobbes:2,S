That is the real danger. There is a big opportunity to play. Up until this
point we got most of where we are by looking back over 30 years of OS design
and getting to a similar place. Our API's have years of hindsight for free.
To borrow a quote from Vern Schryver:
 " It's not that the suggestions are not good ideas.  That problem is that
   committees cannot say no to good ideas, while the one thing that matters
   above all in any design task is saying no to almost everything. "
Linux-kernel is the committee in this case..
