That would depend who wrote it.
If they wrote it then yes it would be good to add that information and
the GPLv3 and a note about the email permission to release. If you wrote
it then its a matter of thanking them/whatever as appropriate.
Either way it would be good if a copy of the agreement email went
(privately) to the Linux Foundation so its on record should there ever be
questions, and possibly to Linus as well.
And thanks appear in order to Realtek.
