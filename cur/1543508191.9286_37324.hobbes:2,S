According to the 2.2.10 kitchen sink, the card's IO address is 0x320,
with IRQ 5 and DMA 5, but even specifying those as parameters to the
RH 6.0 driver (kernel 2.2.5-22) results in a "not found" report, so
there MUST be something the 2.2.10 driver's doing that the 2.2.5-22
one isn't. The problem is that I've no idea what !!!
For reference, the system is an Elonex WS-450 with 16M of RAM and a
motherboarded AM79C960KS network controller ic. I've upgraded the hard
drive from 450M (as supplied) to 820M - it's apparently a standard
2.5" hard drive, but it's otherwise as received.
Also on the motherboard is a PS/2 style socket, similar to the ones
used for both keyboard and mouse on this system, but labelled "Sound",
although I can find no trace of any sound configuration in the BIOS.
If anybody can provide any clues re this, it would be MUCH
appreciated...
Best wishes from Riley.
