User's can't violate the GPL. Only distributers can. (If said user is
shipping around copies of the integrated kernel+module - ram images,
in this case - they become a distributer.)
Just to reiterate, since this comes up a lot....
You can do WHATEVER you want on your box, with GPL code. You can (as I
recall) even run paid services (web services, for example) on modified
GPL code without releasing any sources. The GPL only covers
-DISTRIBUTION-. As soon as the modified BINARY gets distributed, the
GPL comes into play. Until that happens, there is NO RESTRICTION.
As far as Broadcom (and Tivo, and Linksys, and Sharp, and....) the
only questions are whether the driver is shipped as a module, and
whether or not the majority of the driver existed in a similar,
non-Linux form before integration. (If its not a module, they are
distributing a modified kernel. If it was written specifically for
Linux, the derived-work question comes in to play.)
