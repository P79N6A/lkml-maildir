Subject: ide-floppy: remove unused flag PC_ABORT
This flag was never being set in the code so remove it. By the way, the
code in the second patch was being executed unconditionally, i.e. in case
pc->retries > IDEFLOPPY_MAX_PC_RETRIES is true (actually that is the only case
when the outer if-test passed), !test_bit(PC_ABORT, &pc->flags)
was always true so the comment is now incorrect and has to go.
