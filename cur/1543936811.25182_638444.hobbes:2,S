Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/3] i386 boot: replace boot_ioremap with enhanced bt_ioremap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset replaces boot_ioremap with a enhanced version of
bt_ioremap and renames the bt_ioremap to early_ioremap. This reduces
12k from .init.data segment and increases the size of memory that can
be re-mapped before paging_init to 64k.
This patchset is based on linux-2.6.24-rc5-mm1 +
efi-split-efi-tables-parsing-code-from-efi-runtime-service-support-code.patch.
It has been tested on i386 with PAE on/off.
Best Regards,
Huang Ying
