This might be true for full-blown desktop systems - but these do not 
tend to be the systems where kernel image size matters that much.
Smaller kernel image size might be an issue e.g. for distribution 
kernels, but in a much less pressing way.
The systems where kernel image size really matters are systems with few 
modules where you know in advance which modules you might need. I played 
a bit with the ARM defconfigs, and if you consider that you can't build 
the filesystem for accessing your modules modular I haven't found any 
where making everything modular would have given a real kernel image 
size gain compared to the CONFIG_MODULES=n case.
