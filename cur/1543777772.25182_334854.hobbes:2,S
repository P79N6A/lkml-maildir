Subject: Avoiding BIGMEM support programatically.

Hello All,
I have a program working fine on a 2.6.xx-smp kernel, and the program
crashes on the same version kernel with bigmem i.e (2.6.xxx-bigmem).
I also found that for a same executable on bigmem kernel the virtual
address's of '&_start' and '&_etext', seem to vary in every new run.
Is there any way I can avoid the kernel's bigmem virtual address
mapping programatically? and still run the program on a bigmem kernel?
Really appreciate your help in this context.
Best Regards,
Vamsi Kundeti.
