Well, what would change your mind?
I don't really care, as I maintain just one Linux router which routes
substantial bandwidth and which could easily be protected by upstream
ACLs in the case of an emergency.  Others rely on Linux routers for
their ISP business, and they see similar problems as well, and these
people *do* care about this problem.  Some of them contacted me and
told me that they were ignored when they described it.  They certainly
want this problem to be fixed, as using FreeBSD is not always an
option. 8-(
