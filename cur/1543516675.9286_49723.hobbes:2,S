The funny thing is that in all my years of hacking on reiserfs, neither I nor
anyone else on my team has ever corrupted any ext2 partitions as a result of the
many bugs in not yet debugged test versions of reiserfs.  I thought that surely
I would have to worry about this, but no....  I learned by experience not theory
that it just doesn't happen, and not to worry about it.  Maybe other
FS developers have had a different experience.  That said, a buggy reiserfs
surely can crash the machine, and so yes, you should not use an unstable
reiserfs release on a mission critical machine.  We'll have something stable in
a few days I hope.

).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
