This is in reference to the reported seg-faults when attempting to
fclose() an invalid file pointer.
The following shows that my current 'C' runtime library does not
adhere to any known standard when referencing the FILE object during
fclose(). This is gcc 2.7.2.3  (libc 5.3.12)
According to existing Linux documentation, this should return
EBADF. It should NOT seg-fault.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>
int main ()
{
    FILE *fp;
    fp = (FILE *)malloc(sizeof(FILE));/* Make sure the pointer is valid */
    fprintf(stderr, "%p\n", fp);      /* Display valid address */
    fclose(fp);
    puts("It worked??");              /* Will not occur  */
    return 0;
}

$$$ man fclose
FCLOSE(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual           FCLOSE(3)
NAME
       fclose - close a stream
SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       int fclose( FILE *stream);
DESCRIPTION
       The  fclose function dissociates the named stream from its
       underlying file or set of functions.  If  the  stream  was
       being used for output, any buffered data is written first,
       using fflush(3).
RETURN VALUES
       Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise,  EOF
       is  returned and the global variable errno is set to indi-
       cate the error.  In either case no further access  to  the
       stream is possible.
ERRORS
line 1       EBADF  The argument stream is not an open stream.
line 4
       The fclose function may also fail and set errno for any of
       the  errors  specified  for  the  routines   close(2)   or
       fflush(3).
SEE ALSO
       close(2), fflush(3), fopen(3), setbuf(3)
STANDARDS
       The  fclose  function conforms to ANSI C3.159-1989 (``ANSI
       C'').

I reported a similar problem several years ago when I way trying to
substitute during runtime, a FILE pointer obtained from a fopen() and
the default FILE pointer(s) of stdin, stdout, stderr. In other words,
if the program didn't have a terminal, stdout and stderr would go to
a file.
Because the FILE *object didn't work as a real pointer, I could not
do:
        FILE *fp;
	fp = fopen("filename", "w");
        fflush(stdout);
        fflush(stderr);
        stdout = fp;
        stderr = fp;     
The next write to stdout would segfault. This behavior was never seen
on any other Unix system, including Ultrix and Sun(s). In fact, the
interplay of the FILE object was a feature of Unix 'C' programming.
In the example above, I could have saved the original FILE *, and
restored it later in the program. With Linux, you can't even compile
such a program because the assignments will result in 'invalid lvalue'
errors. This is because Linux libc's stdout is not a FILE * at all!
This breaks compatability rules because, for instance fprintf() takes,
as it's first parameter, a pointer of type FILE.
So we have the case of fprintf(stderr, ...) compiling and working because
stderr is a FILE pointer, but I can't make a legal assignment to it like
any other FILE pointers.
Go figure.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
