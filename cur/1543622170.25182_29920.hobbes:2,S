Now what happens if you have more than one HOST of the same kind or the
"SAME HOST" with multiple functions but are really one HOST?
I do not see how this will handle the problem.
But obviously I have been to far down making sure the DATA got to platter
correct and most likely missed a few things. :-/

Okay we are getting some place now, cause what I was reading and seeing in
the changes registers a DRIVE to the PCI API and not a HOST.

I thought there were a few conversations to address this point.
What everyone is maybe missing is PATA (parallel ata) does not permit
"Disconnect/Release".
Maybe I need to sit down w/ Patrick to figure out how to pound the model
into my thick head.
Much of my unwillingness to move rapid is because the past has shown
massive problem, and Linus has never permitted rapid design changes in the
ata/atapi stack.  So much if this is a shock to the system.
