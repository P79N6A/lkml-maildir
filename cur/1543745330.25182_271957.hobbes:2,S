Huh? You KNOW that you don't have more than 7 registers available
on ix86 so you KNOW that you either need a pointer to a struct (one 
parameter) or it won't work.
FYI:
 	eax = function code
 	ebx = first parameter
 	ecx = second parameter
 	edx = third parameter
 	esi = fourth parameter
 	edi = fifth parameter
 	ebp = sixth parameter
You need esp for the call and you need eip for the code. There
are no other registers except segment registers.
