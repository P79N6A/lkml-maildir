In general, you're right because we don't have perfect hardware hotplugging 
yet. But cpu hotplugging is one area we do have, so it should work. (I ought 
to be one of those people, because I'm the author of the Suspend2 
patches :) ... not that I'm claiming complete knowledge of all things related 
to suspending! )
