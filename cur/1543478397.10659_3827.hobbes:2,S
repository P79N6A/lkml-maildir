I am using CFS by Matt Blaze which uses NFS mount points for encrypted
filesystems. I am getting lockd error messages in syslog whenever procmail
tries to lock my encrypted INBOX for writing:
Jan 17 09:42:47 fuel kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 127.0.0.1 
Jan 17 09:43:01 fuel last message repeated 19 times
Procmail also emits a message:
From xxx  Sun Jan 17 09:42:51 1999
 Subject: Re: 
  Folder: /crypt/mailcrypt/beldridg
1862
procmail: Kernel-lock failed
procmail: Kernel-unlock failed
I looks like this is because the NFS mount point for the encrypted
filesystem is localhost. Here is what the setup looks like:
[beldridg@fuel beldridg]$ mount |grep nfs
localhost:/null on /crypt type nfs (rw,port=3049,intr,addr=127.0.0.1)
[beldridg@fuel beldridg]$ ll / |grep null
d---------   2 root     root         1024 Nov  1 17:26 null
[beldridg@fuel beldridg]$ ll / |grep crypt
drwxrwxrwx   4 root     root         8192 Jan 17 09:36 crypt
I am not using the kernel nfsd implementation and am using userspace nfs
instead:
[beldridg@fuel linux]$ cat .config |grep -i nfs
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_NFSD is not set
Any ideas?
