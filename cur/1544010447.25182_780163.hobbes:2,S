Hi,
I am wondering how to handle this:
Does the kernel somehow handle MSI message readback from the PCI config space 
for the MSI message as described in 6.8.1 of the PCI Bus specification 2.3 or 
does a device specific driver have to read the Message Address and Data ?
To put it short: i am wondering how i should read the MSI messages.
Thanks,
Manu
