Subject: [PATCH] dm: memory leak in failed table_load()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Alasdair,
This patch fixes following two problems which occur when "dmsetup load foo"
is executed before the map of the "foo" is created.
  o memory leak.
  o unable to unload the dm_mod module.
Please consider to apply.
How to reproduce the problem:
  # echo "0 10 linear 8:16 0" | dmsetup load foo
  (Need to change "8:16" appropriately.)
Patch for 2.6.14:
