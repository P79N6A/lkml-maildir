another (more remote) possibility is that the timestamp counter gets
somehow messed up during MMX ops. Does the ALSA detector use the
timestamp counter, or does it only use jiffies? (if it only used jiffies
that would give us some robustness since it's an independent
time-source.) I suspect 'music indeed skips' isnt a good enough test for
this case, given that jackd starts up ...
