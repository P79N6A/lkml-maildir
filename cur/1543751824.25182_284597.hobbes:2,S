It breaks netscape 3 if I simulate it (but thats picking an app I know
makes silly assumptions).

guaranteed but that is if anything made easier by the changes.
(From pathconf)
	fpathconf(_PC_PATH_BUF)
             returns  the  size of the pipe buffer, where filedes must
refer
              to a pipe or FIFO and path must refer to  a  FIFO.  The 
corre-
              sponding macro is _POSIX_PIPE_BUF.
(From pwrite)
Write requests of {PIPE_BUF} bytes or less shall not be interleaved with
data from other processes doing writes on the same pipe. Writes of
greater than {PIPE_BUF} bytes may have data interleaved, on arbitrary
boundaries, with writes by other processes, whether or not the
O_NONBLOCK flag of the file status flags is set.
[of O_NDELAY for pipe]
A write request for {PIPE_BUF} or fewer bytes shall have the following
effect: if there is sufficient space available in the pipe, write()
shall transfer all the data and return the number of bytes requested.
Otherwise, write() shall transfer no data and return -1 with errno set
to [EAGAIN].
