I found this on 2.6.15-rc7 but it was on linux-2.6.14 already:
   CC      arch/x86_64/kernel/crash.o
In file included from include/asm/kexec.h:5,
                  from include/linux/kexec.h:9,
                  from arch/x86_64/kernel/crash.c:15:
include/asm/proto.h:66: error: syntax error before "cpu_initialized"
include/asm/proto.h:66: warning: type defaults to `int' in declaration of `cpu_initialized'
include/asm/proto.h:66: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
gmake[1]: *** [arch/x86_64/kernel/crash.o] error 1
#include <linux/cpumask.h> might be included in "asm-x86_64/proto.h"
however, it happens only with a very unusual configuration:
CONFIG_X86_64=y
CONFIG_KEXEC=y
CONFIG_COMPAT=n
else linux/cpumask.h gets included somewhere else...
Dieter.
