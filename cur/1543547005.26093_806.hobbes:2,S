BTW, I've yet to see a good use for all-but-VM sharing after exec.
Unsharing everything in the exec lets one avoid a system call.
Unsharing nothing makes exec smaller and faster.

I'm very much not obsessed with kernel-enforced POSIX,
but it is good to reduce the hoops glibc has to jump through.
Reality involves getting pthreads to be half-way fast.
If a pthread_exec() system call would really help, why not?
As a separate system call it shouldn't be too offensive.

Proposal 'c' is that way. If you agree that "VM is just one of
the resources" but think that there are "uses for sharing between
different programs", proposal 'a' is for you.
Want to unshare VM? Do it, with the new unshare() call.
Want rope to hang yourself? Do an exec while multiple
threads are running, most of which will crash when the VM
changes right under them. If a close-on-exec shared with
the child would hurt, Don't Do That. Personalities make
life fun when you randomly exec unknown executables into
your thread group.
This is clean and fast. Only the setuid wart needs to
be handled. All the other kernel bloat just goes away.

Sure, but normally this disease only afflicts one task.
With the personality code doing an unshare, there is no
way for the original thread group to know what will remain
shared after the exec.
For an app, getting back an error code may be most desirable.

Hey, that works for the VM too. An "unshare if you like" policy
lets one have plenty of clean and fast rope.

Fine, plan 'a' then: "If you are stupid enough to pack a full
load of people into a car that is already half full, some of
the people might get injured or killed. Don't do that."
Either plan will reduce the special-case crap. The POSIX way
also works, if you're into that sort of thing.
