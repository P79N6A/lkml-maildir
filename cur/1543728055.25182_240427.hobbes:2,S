This is my third and last attempt to get this fix merged for 2.6.8.
Without this patch, mainline via-rhine cannot wake the chip if some other
driver puts it to D3. The problem has hit quite a few people already.
This is a fix for the heisenbug with via-rhine refusing to work
sometimes. Patch "[9/9] Restructure reset code" contained a change made
necessary by patch [8/9]. Mainline merged [8/9] for 2.6.8 and is still
missing the fix, while -mm got it with [9/9].
Jesper Juhl provided crucial test data when no one else was able to
reproduce the symptoms.
