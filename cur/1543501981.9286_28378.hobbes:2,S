Ah, but nobody cares about Cyrix systems.  In fact, we're aiming for an
Intel-only society.  Therefore, it's only natural that the scores of flaws
in Intel CPU's will be fixed up on bootup, and everybody else can just
suffer or buy Intel.
[yes I'm jesting, if it's not obvious.  I don't even own an x86; my box is
an Alpha.  but I still think the known x86 bugs should be fixed up on
bootup]
