The purpose is, of course, not to have a "fair test" but to have something to 
quote in marketing adverts.  Most of Microsoft's advertising is aimed at 
Management types and others with a similar lack of clues.  Those people don't 
have either the knowledge or experience to judge if a test is fair or not. Sad 
to say, but these are the people who make the buying decisions in most 
companies.  (Which explains why so many companies have Exchange installed.)
