Subject: [PATCH] Russian encoding support for MacHFS

 Hello, guys! I'd like to present to the community my second kernel project. This patch adds support for russian characters on MacHFS volumes if you use koi8-r encoding on Linux (this is the common case in Russia).
 The implementation is probably not very good because it uses its own tables instead of NLS modules. Using NLS modules i consider impossible because due to MacHFS nature (at least current implementation nature) names must be supplied in MacOS encoding for proper searching. This means that you must to be able to reverse-translate all names from Linux encoding to Mac encoding. Using NLS causes characters loss if requested character does not exist in the table (it is substituted by '?'). Macintosh disks often contains specific characters in file names ("Folder" character for example) which will be lost in this case.
 If someone has some idea how to fix this you're welcome. I currently don't see a way to make the thing better because i don't know internal HFS structure. Probably using utf8 as host encoding would solve the problem but it's not commonly used in Russia.
