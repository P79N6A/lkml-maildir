Well, I do not want this to restart a religion war.
The real thing is: gcc 3.0 (ISO C 99) does not like that practice
(let useless things there for someday using them ?). And there can be
other languaje issues also (I'm just thinkin of some issues with case and
no default:) And gcc-3 is what we will
have to live with. I suppose people will like to see a kernel build
without tons of wanings. They hide real errors.
I think its a good thing to decide what to do (and start doing), than wait
until gcc2.95 is buried.
