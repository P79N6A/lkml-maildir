Yes, it's an ALPS touchpad.
Ok, I compiled latest synaptics driver (synaptics-0.14.0) under the 
following conditions
    - Enabled CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2 (already enabled)
    - Enabled CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV (this one on purpose)
I read README.alps so I tried patching the kernel with alps.patch as 
suggested. Looks like it didn't work because patch refused to patch 
already patched files. I gave a look at the patch and the kernel code, 
and they seem to be incompatible (maybe you need to release a newe patch).
So I proceded without the patched kernel, installing the synaptics 
driver using INSTALL and README.alps settings.
With plain INSTALL settings (no ALPS), the touchpad seemed responsible, 
but kind of slow. Simple or double click didn't work.
With README.alps settings, touchpad feels a lot like in 2.6.10, thought 
the "acceleration" seems to be non-linear.
Simple click worked BUT double-click didn't work. Horizontal/Vertical 
scroll and Click-n-Drag worked too, so I'm almost there.
I tried to patch alps.c using the tiny patch at README.alps but that 
didn't work either as that version is clearly not designed for 2.6.10 
alps.c.
Thanks for your help.
By the way, I'm using a Toshiba laptop (Toshiba Satellite A10), maybe 
you would like to add that to your supported hardware list.
