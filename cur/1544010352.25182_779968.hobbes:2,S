For ARM, I'd prefer this to be:
	unsigned long fd, const struct iovec __user *vec,
		loff_t pos, unsigned long vlen
to avoid any variance in ABIness which will occur with the argument
layout as it currently stands, but that creates a silly argument
order.  The other option would be for us to define our own version
in an ARM ABI independent manner:
ssize_t sys_arm_preadv(unsigned long fd, const struct iovec __user *vec,
	unsigned long vlen, unsigned long low_pos, unsigned long high_pos)
