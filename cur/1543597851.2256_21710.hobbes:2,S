Well as i said, my system _never_ locks up completly ( but it might look
that way because it's crawlin'-like-a-dog ).
The problem is that i can shh in as root, but not as any other user ( not
via login or su or either ).
Root always works, and mind you, this is _after_ the "attack", and the
system resources is back to normal as far as i can tell.
It leads me to think something is wrong with the nproc rlimit accounting or
something like that, maybe in the oom kill code?
