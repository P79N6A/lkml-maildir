The real workload doesn't see much of an improvement. The changes I did
when tinkering yesterday seem like they're better at modelling just
what's going on with that one.
I've added the new testcase I'm using for the numbers I posted last
night at 
http://lixom.net/~olof/threadtest/new/,
 including numbers for
the various kernels. I also included the binaries I built. (with "gcc
-DLOOPS=<size> testcase.c -lpthread").
I tried graphing the numbers as well, it looks like for larger workloads
that 2.6.22 has a fixed benefit over newer kernels. I.e. it seems quicker
at rebalancing, but once things balance out they're obviously doing ok
independent of kernel version.

 I couldn't
figure out how to make the X axis linear, so it obviously looks odd with
the current powers-of-two at the end instead of linear, but the
differences can still be seen clearly.
