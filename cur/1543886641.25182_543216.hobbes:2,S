You're right about my assumptions. Are there any existing drivers that
break them? Are there even any usb-based controllers around? I though
most usb-mmc controllers used the USB Mass Storage class and thus
don't use the mmc subsystem at all.

I see. The flush_workqueue approach might end up waiting for other
things than just scanning, is that the problem? Would it be better to
add a per-host "inital scan complete" completion that we could wait on
instead?

Yeah, but I don't understand why we keep breaking it without providing
any real alternative (apart from distro-specific initrd scripts.)
Also, with scsi you can do the scanning in parallel, but wait for all
of them to complete before mounting the root filesystem. This is what I
want the mmc subsystem to do as well.

I've never used initrd with nfs root. I suspect most distributions use
initrd so that they can build a generic, modular kernel and just load
the modules they need from initrd.
And nfs root often uses DHCP to obtain an IP address, it has to do
portmap lookups, etc, so it definitely qualifies as a pesky,
asynchronous bugger. But it still manages to be synchronous enough to
be able to mount root without depending on initrd or rootdelay.

I'm not sure how many embedded people actually know how to build an
initrd for a custom board.

Simple enough, I suppose. But it still adds complexity to the system
which used to be unnecessary.

The problem from _my_ point of view is that this feature already worked
until 2.6.20, so the promise has already been made.

Well, it's mostly inconvenience I suppose. But I'm also worried about
increasing the boot time of systems that used to boot in 4-5 seconds.
One second extra spent doing decompression, polling files in sysfs,
etc. could have a huge impact, relatively speaking.
Now, I'm not really opposed to the whole concept of doing filesystem
mounting from early userspace -- I think that might be a quite elegant
approach. But a) the prepare_namespace code is still in the kernel, so
it ought to work, b) klibc has not yet been merged so each user is on
his own, and c) Repeatedly reading sysfs files to see when the root
device is available is one thing that I don't think is very elegant.
But if you don't want this issue fixed (i.e. you don't think of it as
an issue) I guess I have to either start working on yet another initrd
setup or just apply the patch to our vendor kernel and be done with it.
The latter certainly is the most tempting, but I suppose the former is
more like how things are supposed to be done in the future.
