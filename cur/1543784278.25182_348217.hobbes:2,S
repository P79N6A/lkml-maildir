The hooks are there, but possibly you are confused by the out-of-date
documentation (e.g. Documentation/DocBook/lsm.tmpl still says to look
for "security_ops->" in the core kernel for the hook calls, but they
have long since been replaced with calls to static inline functions
defined in include/linux/security.h).  As an example,
fs/namei.c:permission calls security_inode_permission, which is defined
in include/linux/security.h and will invoke the corresponding hook if
CONFIG_SECURITY=y.  SELinux provides its implementations of the hook
functions in security/selinux/hooks.c, e.g. selinux_inode_permission.
Hence, you should be looking for calls to functions with the security_
prefix instead of explicit references to security_ops in the core
kernel.
Chris - feel free to rip out lsm.tmpl and replace it with something more
up-to-date and complete.
