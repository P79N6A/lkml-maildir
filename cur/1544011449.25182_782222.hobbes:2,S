+Advanced APIs for drivers

or                  to userspace

+interface and a combination of
+1) pgprot_noncached()
+2) io_remap_pfn_range() or remap_pfn_range() or vm_insert_pfn()
+
+With pat support, a new API pgprot_writecombine is being added. So, driver can
s/pat/PAT/
s/driver/drivers/ or s/driver/a driver/
+continue to use the above sequence, with either pgprot_noncached() or
+pgprot_writecombine() in step 1, followed by step 2.
+
+In addition, step 2 internally tracks the region as UC or WC in memtype
+list in order to ensure no conflicting mapping.
+
+Note that this set of APIs only work with IO (non RAM) regions. If driver
                                 works with IO (non-RAM) regions. If a driver
+wants to export RAM region, it has to do set_memory_uc() or set_memory_wc()
          export a RAM region,
+as step 0 above and also track the usage of those pages and use set_memory_wb()
+before the page is freed to free pool.
