You are still very much wrong, and now you refuse to even /read/ what i 
wrote. Your only reply to my detailed analysis is: "it is slow, because 
it is slow and heavy". I told you how fast it is, i told you what 
happens on a context switch and why, i told you that you can measure if 
you want.

You are wrong. Let me show you some more numbers. This is a 
hackbench_pth.c run:
  $ ./hackbench_pth 500
  Time: 14.371
this uses 20,000 real threads and during this test the runqueue length 
is extreme - up to over a ten thousand threads. (hackbench_pth.c was 
posted to lkml recently.
The same run with hackbench.c (20,000 forked processes):
  $ ./hackbench 500
  Time: 14.632
so the TLB overhead from using processes is 1.8%.

how much would it take for you to actually re-measure it and interpet 
the results you are seeing? You've apparently built a whole mental house 
of cards on the flawed proposition that tasks are 'super-heavy' and that 
context-switching them is 'slow'. You are unwilling to explain /how/ 
they are slow, and all the numbers i post are contrary to that 
proposition of yours.
your whole reasoning seems to be faith-based:
[...] Anyway, kevents are very small, threads are very big, [...]
How about following the scientific method instead?

you are wrong, and i have pointed it out to you in my previous replies 
why you are wrong. Your only coherent specific thought on this topic was 
your incorrect assumption is that the scheduler somehow saves registers 
and that this makes it heavy. I pointed it out to you in the mail you 
reply to that /every/ system call that saves user registers. You've not 
even replied to that point of mine, you are ignoring it completely and 
you are still repeating your same old, incorrect argument. If it is 
heavy, /why/ do you think it is heavy? Where is that magic pixie dust 
piece of scheduler code that miraculously turns the runqueue into a 
molass slow, heavy piece of thing?
Or put in another way: your test-code does ~6 syscalls per every event. 
So if what you said would be true (which it isnt), a kevent based 
request would have be just as slow as thread based request ...

/what/ infrastructure do you mean? sched.c? Most of that never runs in 
the scheduler hotpath.

because it would be pretty stupid to do that?
But more importantly: because many people still believe 'the scheduler 
is slow and context-switching is evil'? The FIO AIO syslet code from 
Jens is an intelligent mix of queueing combined with async execution. I 
expect that model to prevail.

now you come up again with creation overhead but nobody is talking about 
context creation overhead. (btw., you are also wrong if you think that 
mmap() is all that slow - try measuring it one day) We were talking 
about context /switching/.

what on earth does this have to do with the topic of whether context 
switches are fast enough? Or if you like random info, just let me throw 
in a random piece of information as well:
user-space function calls are more than /two/ orders of magnitude faster 
than system calls. Still you are using 6 ... SIX system calls in the 
sample kevent request handling hotpath.

again, please come up with specifics! I certainly came up with enough 
specifics.
