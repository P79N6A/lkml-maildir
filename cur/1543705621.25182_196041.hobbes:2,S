| Yep. The meye driver uses 256 PAGE_SIZE buffers. The kernel virtual

| "toc" containing the dma pointers to these buffers must be given

Well, both.  :)
The toc of dma_addr_t's should be in its own array/structure.
Adding some comments or help text about the highmem limitation
would also be good.
