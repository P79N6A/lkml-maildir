Thanks for the suggestion -- unfortunately, it is only a partial
solution.
During boot with an 80x25 VGA console, the console video is getting
trashed even before the first init script runs. In that case, correcting
the root cause (setting bit 5 in byte 0x55 of the Northbridge config)
does nothing to restore console video (although it does allow X to run
properly). 
So long as I am running a kernel that includes my hack, there's no
problem. My main concern is that the next time that people with a system
like mine want to upgrade their distribution, the distribution's kernel
will include this workaround; those people (myself included) will then
have a miserable time doing the upgrade.
