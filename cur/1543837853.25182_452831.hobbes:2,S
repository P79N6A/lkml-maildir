Are we really expecting that many global structure members to be
variable width? I only propose adding another option because whenever a
sector is printed, it must be casted to avoid warnings.
Other replies commented on how gcc won't recognize the new option, so
we'd receive warnings anyway. Cleaner code that causes warnings doesn't
sound like a big win after all.
