Well, you don't actually have to teach it about pgdats, but try out how 
much simpler the actual implementation is if you were to just add a 
"endzone" macro, allowing the macros to do nesting.
Once you do that, you can basically expand the thing any which way, 
something like
#define for_each_zone(zone) \
	do { pg_data_t * __pgdat; \
		for (__pgdat = pgdat_list; __pgdat; __pgdat = __pgdat->next) { \
			int __i; \
			for (i = 0; i < MAX_ZONES; i++) { \
				zone = pgdat->node_zones; \
				if (!zone->size) \
					break; \
				do { \
#define end_zone \
				while (0); \
			} \
		} \
	} while (0)
Which requires the user to use something like
	for_each_zone(zone) {
		...
	} end_zone;
but doesn't need changing the double loop into a artificial single loop.
