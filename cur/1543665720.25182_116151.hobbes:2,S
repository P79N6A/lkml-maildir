Subject: [2.4.20] system freezes Intel e1000(included & 4.4.19) & bonding(20030207, active-backup mode)

Hardware:
    Tyan S2723 (dual XEON)
    [both NICs onboard]
    Intel Pro/1000 MT Gigabit Adaptor (primary ethernet)
    Intel EEPro/100 (secondary)
Software:
    Linux 2.4.20
    bonding patch 20030207
    included e1000 driver and the 4.4.19 release from intel
Upon reconfig of the bonding interface the system freezes. I have not 
been so lucky yo see a panic. I do know that it occurs when I run ifconfig.
If I do not use bonding, but do load both ethernet drivers I do not 
experience any lockups.
Is anyone else using 2.4.20 bonding in combination w/ the e1000 or 
better yet the Tyan S2723?
thank u all,
