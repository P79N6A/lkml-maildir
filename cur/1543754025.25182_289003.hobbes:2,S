no, this isn't true. the performance you are getting isn't as good as
SCHED_FIFO on a tuned system (h/w and s/w). the difference might be
the fact that you have "an average desktop", or it might be that your
desktop is just fine and SCHED_ISO actually is not as good as
SCHED_FIFO.

agreed. i have every confidence that Lee and/or Jack will be
forthcoming :)
