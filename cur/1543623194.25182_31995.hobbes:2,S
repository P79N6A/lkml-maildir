Around the lk 2.4.6 timescale Stephen got "verballed"
on this list about the design of kiobufs (which lie
behind raw devices). Some patches went in from
Andrea Arcangeli. I don't think Stephen has had much
to do with raw devices or kiobufs since that time.
The good news is that raw devices in the lk 2.5 series
are now as fast (if not faster) than they were prior to
lk 2.4.6 . As an example, using the scsi_debug driver
(it's a ram disk) lk 2.4.18 yields 211 MB/sec while
in lk 2.5.6-pre2 that jumps up to 754 MB/sec on the
same hardware (1.2 GHz Athlon with DDR ram).
