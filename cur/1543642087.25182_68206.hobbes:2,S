That's the exact problem that's already been mentioned twice,
and I'm confident of that one being solved. Lock the whole
FS if necessary, but read the bitmap and lock the bitmap on disk
until the extension is finished and the bitmap is written back.
It has been suggested that the VFS support a "reserve/release blocks"
operation. It would simply mark the ondisk bitmap bits as used
and add them to our available list. Then every file extension
or creation would need to be preceded by a reserve command,
or fail, according to policy.

There is no problem locking and serializing groups of
read/write accesses.  Please stop harping on about THAT at
least :-). What is a problem is marking the groups of accesses.

That's fine. And I don't see what needs to be reread. You had this
problem once with smp, and you beat it with locks.

Quite possibly, but not too slow for reading data in and writing data
out, at gigabyte/s rates overall, which is what the intention is.
That's not general use. And even if it were general use, it would still
be pretty acceptable _in general_.

The correctness issues are the only important ones, once we have
correct and fast shared read and write to (existing) files.

It's far too inconvenient to be totally without a FS. What we
want is a normal FS, but slower at some things, and faster at others,
but correct and shared. It's an approach. The caclulations show
clearly that r/w  (once!) to existing files are the only performance
issues. The rest is decor. But decor that is very nice to have around.
