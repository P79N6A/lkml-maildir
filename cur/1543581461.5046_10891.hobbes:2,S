Yes, the LOOKUP rule caused 'modprobe sr_mod' to be
executed, then your cd devices will be visible in
devfs and accessible. Under the old /dev system
they were always "visible" but not accessible until
you loaded sr_mod .

Chiaki,
The upper level scsi drivers (sd, sr, st, osst and sg) register
and unregister device names with devfs. After the mid level
recognizes a new scsi device it calls the detect() function
in the builtin upper level drivers and those that are currently
loaded as modules. That is your "problem", sr_mod.o is not
loaded until you do something like "ls -l /dev/sr0" (due to
that LOOKUP rule in /etc/devfsd.conf). The lsmod command will
show which modules are loaded (in your case look for sr_mod).
There is no "push" mechanism in the scsi mid level to load
the sr_mod.o module when it sees a device with SCSI type
CDROM. Devfs (specifically devfsd) supplies various "pull"
mechanisms (e.g. LOOKUP) to load that module.
