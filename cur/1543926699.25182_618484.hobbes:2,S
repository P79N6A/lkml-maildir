No, the global flag is hardly ever useful.  You almost never know the
details of all the libraries you link to well enough to determine that
they don't need FD_CLOEXEC disabled.  Even more problematic, you cannot
know whether they will need it in future.
For applications the solution is simple: wrap to appropriate calls.
Apache has all these apr_ wrappers.  But them to some good news after all.
