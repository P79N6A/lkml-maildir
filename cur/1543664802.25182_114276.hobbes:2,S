Yes I recall this discussion against a gcc based benchmark. However it is 
interesting that it still performed by far the best.

That's what mem_load is. It repeatedly tries to access 110% of available ram.
quote from original post:
mem_load:
Kernel         [runs]   Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.63              3   104     75.0    57.7    1.9     1.32
2.5.63-mm2cfq       3   101     76.2    52.3    2.0     1.28
2.5.63-mm2          3   132     59.1    90.3    2.3     1.65
2.5.63-mm2dl        3   100     79.0    52.0    2.0     1.27
Note that mm2 with AS performed equivalent to the other schedulers but on 
later runs took longer. (99, 148,150) This is usually suspicious of a memory 
leak that contest is unusually sensitive at picking up, but there wasn't 
anything suspicious about the meminfo after these runs, and none of the other 
loads changed over time. io_load usually shows drastic prolongation when 
memory is leaking.
