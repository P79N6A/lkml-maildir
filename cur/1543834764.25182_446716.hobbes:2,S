It could be a reason. If we choose to enable AER for all devices by default, we
could do so in function pci_enable_device. Then, aerdriver could only be compiled
into kernel instead of a module.

It looks like good, but makes things complicated. I once wrote the error handlers
for tg3 pci-e driver and felt it's not easy to follow pci-error-recovery.txt.
Just like the driver error handlers of some NIC you wrote before, you chose
to do slot reset for all errors. Is it really useful to add a new state?

The hierarchy consists of just all the devices below the device who reports
the error to root port. For example, assume device tg3 NIC connects to bridge
A. The connection is like:
NIC<==>Downstream port B<==>Upstream port A<==>Root port.
If Upstream port A captures an AER error, the hierarchy consists of
Downstream port B and NIC.

aer root port driver is just AER port service driver. Specific switch's
upstream port might have different link reset method.

Callback link_reset definition is confusing and causes driver error handlers
too complicated. The link reset only happens when a fatal error happens,
driver should do a full recovery.

Yes. I will add more pointers.

Is it true for bridges (Upstream port and downstream port)? Most bridges
have no drivers, not mentioning error handlers.
Currently, I choose to enable AER for all ports (bridges) by default.
