Very well, it is what I really wish to do. The networking code is no simple
issue in linux. As I underlined, two c files, tcp_input.c and udp.c controls
how the checksum is done and the code looks very complicated. Perhaps you
have some idea about where in 100K source code to change in order to disable
checksumming but at the same time not to break normal operation. I can apply
a change in the code, recompile the kernel and test it. I have installed a
virtual machine running linux in order to experiment with the settings, but
the problem is that I do not have enough time to understand what the code is
all about. Perhaps it is in sock.h, perhaps skbuff.h, or any other file.
Each and every file seems to contain some function related to checksumming.
