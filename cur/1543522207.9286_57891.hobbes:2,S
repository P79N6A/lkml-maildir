And who is going to do that service to mankind? Requires pretty widespread
efforts... Besides, you can trivially do that without relaying anything -
just email them and ask to be included. I would be _really_ surprised if
request would not be satisfied.

So use them...

Not really. I'm not too fond of ORBS (and maintainer is definitely an

In practice quite a few places are using them. But this horse had been
beaten to death _long_ ago. You know, if I'll want to wade through the
swamp of luserdom nanae had turned into... I know where to find it. The
same goes for most of the people here. Ferchrissake, it's one of the
most boring nanae flamefests. Have a bloody decency to keep it there.
news.admin.* is that -> way.
