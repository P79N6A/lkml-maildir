What horrible hacks? All that is needed in the kernel is a simple if
statement, to reject these commands. Anyway, Andre is now proposing to T13
that the drive itself enforce these limits, logging any violations to
invalidate the warranty. End of problem: the drive does it for us.

Sorry, I can't parse that. WHAT is because of attemts to make WHAT simple
for users - the restriction to a specific platform group, just so users
can have a nice point&drool interface for firmware changes?

WTF does that come in - we're talking about writing firmware in devices,
not writing to a CD-R. TOTALLY different issue.

Such as? A handful of standard things the kernel should provide anyway
(powersave, DMA mode, etc), and a block of commands which MUST NOT be
issued to the drive EVER (except by the drive vendor's maintenance
software.)
