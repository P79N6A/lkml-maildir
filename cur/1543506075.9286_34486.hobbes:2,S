$0.02 ->
Big strings mean big kernels. Not too good. The kernel doesn't
know, and *** must not know *** about 'dev/sda1'. The kernel knows
about major/minor devices numbers, not about some abitrary strings inside
a file-name.
A file-name is just a 'trick' to associate a major/minor device number
with a file descriptor. It doesn't even have to be in /dev......
