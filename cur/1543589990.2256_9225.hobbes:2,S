Exactly.

Something about that, didn't make any comparision to a original
2.4.4 kernel.
I first thought the same Keith did, a userspace program.
This could call the same asm code used in kd_nosound,
but the problem is, the next time _kd_mksound is called,
sound is enabled again.
Can somebody give me a hint where to find documentation about
sysctl and howto use/program that ?
This is what Simon and David suggested.
But as long as I am not able to make sysctl's, I would like
to add this feature under the General setup.
What do you think ?
Nico
