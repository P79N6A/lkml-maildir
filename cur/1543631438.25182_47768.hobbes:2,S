There is a simple reason for this: the goal is (or at least "was")
that irq.c would eventually become platform-independent.  To prepare
for this, I keep the ia64 version of irq.c as much in sync with the
x86 version as possible (actually, I haven't check recently, so there
may have been some divergence while I wasn't watching).  So, yes,
there is some dead code in the ia64 version, but it does serve the
purpose to minimize the differences with the x86 version.
