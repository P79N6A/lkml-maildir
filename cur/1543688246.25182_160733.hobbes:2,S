Hi there 
As part of a project I am trying to write a framebuffer device
driver for a graphic chip. Up until now I have compiled my
code as a module and been doing insmod, rmmod and that have worked
nicely.
I then tried to compile the driver into the kernel but that
makes the kernel hang. As my development system are a legacy
free laptop and my driver initializes the screen, the kernel
hangs without me being able to figure out where and why that
happend.
So I seek advice on how to debug the driver! As said, the
laptop are legacy free, so I have not got a serial port. 
I have tried a usb->serial adapter, but that requires a driver.
Can I do USB->USB on another computer? Or?
Or am I stuck with coding my own printk variant and writing to the
screen or is there any other option I have not thought of?
Regards Thomas, Denmark
