The OSDL's patch lifecycle manager (
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm
 ) 
does something like this. It does a series of builds include a few that 
select most every option. So you could toss the patch into PLM and look at
the results of those test compiles.  In particular, the 'Desktop' config
turns on a ton of stuff ( and almost always fails ;)
We also do a 'regress' build, where we do 'make defconfig' and 
'make allmodconfig' and count the errors.
I don't think we have any more detailed docs, but the test report does include
the .config files we run.
