So, I'm not the only one :) Actually, I'm working on a VFS based union
mounts implementation. There are still some major bugs which I want to
fix before posting the patches.
Some key features:
- VFS based approach, all file systems *should* work when mounted read-only
- unification of directory listings with readdir()
- copy-up with the help of Jörn's madcow patches to sendfile
- whiteout implementation for the VFS and ext2
The patches basically implement a union stack with/on dentries. That
is working quite well but I still have some issues with the dcache. At
the moment other stuff has higher priorities.
