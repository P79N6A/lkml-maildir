Hi.
This change ...
2003-05-02  Zack Weinberg  <zack@codesourcery.com>
	PR c/10604
	* c-opts.c (c_common_decode_option <OPT_Wall>): Set
	warn_sign_compare for C++ only.
	* doc/invoke.texi: Clarify documentation of -Wsign-compare.
... has eliminated all the warnings that GCC-3.3 by default printed
with regards to signed/unsigned comparisons. A build of today's BK
with this compiler is much quieter than those previously done
with the 3.3 snapshots.

and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.
