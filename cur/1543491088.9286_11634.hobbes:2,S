Oh, it's indisputable. I guess the thread's over, then.
Really, are you _trying_ to be inflammatory?
You will never be able to _force_ people to change how they refer to
Linux. This includes yelling at them. All you can do is try and
convince them that you're right.
Convincing them involves more than simply shouting the same tired
points over and over again and telling people that they're wrong.
The "most of the code on a Linux system was written by the FSF"
argument has failed to convince people; how about trying a new one
instead of beating this one into the ground?
The same goes for "RMS is being ignored because he's not
business-friendly and that's unfair", "Linux is just the final piece
of the GNU system", and "It's not fair to steal credit from the FSF".
I'm sure you think these are fine arguments; you're not alone in
feeling that way. But since they've failed to convert people to your
way of thinking, please either find new arguments or just give up.
And no matter what you do, PLEASE DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. Take it to
gnu.misc.discuss or Slashdot or somewhere where it's appropriate to
have the same tired flamewar OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
