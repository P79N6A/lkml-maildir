I suggest we ask the maintainer for the MMC subsystem.
Pierre, you can find the details in the bugzilla entry.  Briefly,
there's a pathway in the MMC core suspend routine (if the driver
doesn't implement a resume hook) which could lead to the host being
removed during a system suspend.  This is an illegal operation and it
will deadlock.
Do you have a suggestion for a way to fix it?
