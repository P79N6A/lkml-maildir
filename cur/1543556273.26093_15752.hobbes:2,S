  I've followed the thread on "Persistent module
storage" but haven't come across a general explanation
of the changes to the inter-module symbol stuff
between 2.4test10 and test11.  Anyone care to comment
on the differences or on whether this is going to be a
stable API for 2.4 (it won't be changed again)?
