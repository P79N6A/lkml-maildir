Fix sysvinit. Oh and all getty programs etc - everything that
mucks around with termios.
Alternatively revert the change to drivers/char/serial.c

Oh *ahem* I just read the entire thread again and I remembered it
wrong. It's not the CREAD handling perse, it's something else that
has changed that caused this, but it appears that a solution
hasn't been found yet. Except for fixing all user-space programs.
Sysvinit, agetty, busybox etc etc
Okay so ignore my earlier comments. Sorry.
Mike.
