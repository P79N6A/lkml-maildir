I made it to "work", unfortunately.
It seemed to suspend / resume okay, altrough suspend took *way* too
long (like 1 minute without any apparent disk activity).
Unfortunately now my "main" filesystem (mounted via loop), is
*gode*. Damaged beyond repair, I never managed to trash a filesystem
this badly....
Tommorow I'll try to restore  from backup and run fsck from alternate
superblock; cross your fingers for me.
