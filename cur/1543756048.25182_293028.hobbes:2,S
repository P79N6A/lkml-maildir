If the copy left at C000:0 is jumping off to F000:xx (system BIOS)
that is a valid thing to do and the reset program may need more
emulation hooks. If it is jumping off somewhere else then I would
consider that a broken VBIOS since jumping to C000:3 for reset is part
of how VGA is supposed to work. If this is happening on an ATI or
Nvidia chip you're probably never going to get video resume working.
