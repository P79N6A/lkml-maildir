In the last couple of weeks, I've come across this crash a few times. 
In each case, my code was kobject_add()'ing a kobject to a kset that
already contained a kobject of the same name.
Granted that these additions reflected faulty logic on the part of my
code, but I was suprised that kobject_add didn't have a more intelligent
response than crashing while creating the redundant sysfs dir.
Thoughts?
