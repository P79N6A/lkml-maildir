I have the same problem with a Netgear FA310TX card (Lite-On PNIC based)
with an ASUS TX97-E motherboard (430TX chipset).
My eventual solution was to go and get a new $15 10/100 card at Fry's.
The new card works great.  SMC EZNET-10/100.
BTW, the computer I'm writing this email from now, also uses a FA310TX
card and works great.  It has an ASUS P3B mainboard (440BX chipset).
