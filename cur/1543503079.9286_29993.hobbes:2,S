Hello all,
I have added a bit of functionality to the aha1542 driver.  Previously,
the aha1542 would not accept command-line arguments via insmod.  My patch
gives the module the same functionality at the LILO arguments (portbase,
buson and busoff timings, and dma speed).
The patch is available at 
http://www.fxp.org/~jedgar/linux
 and is against
2.2.10.
Cheers,
Chris
