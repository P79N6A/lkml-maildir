Yes that is what we're trying to avoid, but it is far more complicated
than you think.

This can end up with data corruption, machine checks or 
a broken device. All happened.

At least the direct mapping needs to be changed too and any mapping
comming from other sources (/sys/bus/pci, /dev/mem etc.) 
Otherwise you get the dangerous illegal aliases.
The chances of a driver getting this right even when documented
are very small.
BTW i had some prototype patches to address some of this,
but they need much more work to handle all this properly.
Just reprogramming the PAT registers is really the smallest issue.
The IA64 port has done some of the work as an example, unfortunately they
use a strange memory mapping scheme that cannot be easily moved
over. iirc Bjorn identified over 10 potential sources of cache aliases
that all needed to be addressed in the end.
