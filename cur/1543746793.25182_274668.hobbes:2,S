You have do define a interface between the kernel and the userspace..
you either include kernel headers from userspace (with a lot of 
__KERNEL__ in them) or you make separate headers with the definitions 
and include them in both kernel and userspace (better).
BTW, these are not userspace headers like the ones in /usr/include, 
those are just special headers preparated so that they can be included 
both from the kernel and userspace.

About the compatibility hacks.. now it's time to remove them, together 
with this change. I don't think this will happen before 2.7/2.8 and 
until then all should have changed their code.
If you announce these changes soon enough and the developers have enough 
time to change their code, I don't see any problems.
Maybe you also could wrap these definitions in some #ifdef's and mark 
them as deprecated and write somewhere that they'll be removed in the 
next stable tree (2.8). So you could check if a library compiles with 
the new headers or if it still uses some old definitions.
