Hello,
I installed Linux (kernel 2.6.9/2.6.10, Debian Sid) on a Sun Fire v240
with 2 CPUs and 2G of RAM. If the memory modules are arranged according
to the manual (two modules for each cpu), Linux sees only 1.6G of the
memory. If I put all four memory modules beside one CPU, Linux sees all
two gigs. Under solaris there's no missing memory in either case.
Apart from this, Linux seems to work well on the machine.
Has anyone seen (or, more preferably, solved) this before?
greetings
endre
