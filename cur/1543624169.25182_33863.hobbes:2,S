Which I think we should send before shutdown (and possible poweroff) for
disks (DASDs), Write-Once and Optical Memory devices. (Funny enough, the
SCSI spec also lists SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE for CD-Rom devices
Unfortunately, SYNCHRONIZE CACHE is optional, so we would need to ignore any
errors returned by this command.
