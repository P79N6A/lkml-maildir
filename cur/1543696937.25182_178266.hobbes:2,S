It is intentional.  In 99% of cases it ends up with cleaner methods and
in the rest you can trivially check the ->stop() argument.
Note that you *can* have failing ->next() do cleanup if you want to do
so.  In other words, instances that want such behaviour can get it easily.
And in common case you don't have to bother at all.
With "we call ->stop() only if..." you would still have to do the same amount
of work for hard cases *AND* get extra PITA for normal ones.  IOW, clear loss.
