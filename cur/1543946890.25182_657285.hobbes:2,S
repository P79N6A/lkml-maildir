OOPS'ed again after some hours. The OOPS looks identical to me besides 
all kind of other crap mixed in the trace due to a lot of unrelated 
activity going on.
Quite a lot of the same IAA messages (status 8029 and 8028, cmd 10021) 
in /var/log/debug prior to the crash, over the entire uptime time span.
This was with the first patch posted only. Not any of the other ones.

It'll have to be tomorrow. Should I throw in the anti-oops patch too?
