Hi folks,
For running some kind of database application (ClearCase 4.1) I would 
like to attach an external RAID array with 6*30GByte to a RedHat 6.2 
machine, using kernel 2.2.17. I don't expect huge files (maximum file 
size should be about 250MByte), but a lot of middle size files and 
millions of tiny files.
Will this work? 
Do you expect any problems with the partition table?
Many thanx in advance
Harri
