Right, no queueing for in-kernel... 
But then we have the following: netlink will drop messages sent to
in-kernel socket ony if it can not copy skb - which is i'd say a very
rare scenario. Connector, on the other hand, is guaranteed to drop all
but the very first message sent between 2 schedules. That makes
connector several orders of magnitude less reliable than bare netlink
protocol. And you don't see it with your fork tests because you do
schedule when you fork.
