But it's already exactly one seek in the scheme I proposed.  Notice how of 
the two tracks you can be write-cacheing data for, one is the track you're 
currently over (no seek required, you're there).  You flush to that track, 
there's one more seek to flush to the second track (which you were only 
cacheing data for to avoid latency, so the seek could start immediately 
without waiting for the OS to provide data), and then park.
Now a journal track that's next to where the head parks could combine the 
"park" sweep with that one seek, and presumably be spring powered and hence 
save capacitor power.  But I'm not 100% certain it would be worth it.  (Are 
normal with-power-on seeks towards the park area powered by the spring, or 
the... I keep wanting to say "stepper motor" but I don't think those are what 
drives use anymore, are they?  Sigh...)
