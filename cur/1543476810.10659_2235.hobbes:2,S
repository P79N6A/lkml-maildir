Heh. Even this is incorrect, but it's _really_ close to being right. 
The problem is that you're doing a signed division with 1000 if I'm not
mistaken, and thus even if "timeout*HZ+999" doesn't overflow in 32 bits,
it's enough that it oevrflows in 31.. 
Making the 1000 be "1000UL" should fix it. But I'm too lazy to test.
