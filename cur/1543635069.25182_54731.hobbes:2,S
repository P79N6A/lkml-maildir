I'm sorry to hear about your distress. Hopefully you've had a chance to 
talk to someone about it and calm down a bit.

No, and I'm not about to try very hard. It appears that the place you 
removed it should be fine. In driverfs_unlink, you replace it with i_sem. 
ramfs, which driverfs mimmicks, doesn't hold any lock during unlink. It 
seems it could be removed altogether. 
The other replacement happens in _lseek. That looks fine, though I 
think that entire function can be replaced with one of the generic lseek 
functions...
Patch applied. Thanks,
