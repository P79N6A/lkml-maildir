Thanks Prakash for testing it and spotting thermal problem.
Here are some temperatures from my machine read from the bios on reboot.
I gave it minimal activity for the minutes prior to reboot.
Win98, 47C
XPHome, 42C
Patched Linux 2.4.24 (1000Hz), 40C
Patched Linux 2.6.3-rc1-mm1, 53C  OUCH!
Sorry, I will have to go through my latest patch and see why the temp differs
so much between 2.4 and 2.6. I currently use patched 2.4.24 with Suse 8.2 for
convenience. When it stopped the lockups on 2.6 I thought the 2.6 was
working the same way. 
Daniel - I think you patched your 2.6 too. I assume it is also hot?

Correct, apic_tack will be ignored if the apic.c is not patched with my apic
ack delay patch.
