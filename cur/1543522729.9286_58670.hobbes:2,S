Okay. I get it. The "catch-all" which will work on every architecture,
including those which have not been invented yet, is a (don't laugh)
character array. Think about it. Simple casts+dereference gets to/from
anything you want. Sixteen bytes per element, with the start aligned
properly, will store anything up to 128 bits in length.
