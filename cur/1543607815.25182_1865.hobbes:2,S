You're right. This is what I wanted to do:
   while true
   do
       ssh -R a:b:c host
       sleep 10
   done </dev/never >/dev/null
But I could do it like this:
   while true
   do
       sleep 100000
   done |
   while true
   do
       ssh -R a:b:c host
       sleep 10
   done >/dev/null
Thank you.
Marko
PS Are /dev/null and /dev/zero also redundant?
