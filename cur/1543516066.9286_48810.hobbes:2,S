I have been bitching about this for years ....
This is for a ssh connection via a ricochet:
netstat -ton
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:1026          127.0.0.1:1027 ESTABLISHED off (0.00/0/0)
tcp        0      0 204.179.131.123:1745    207.33.153.134:6667 ESTABLISHED on2 (7106.08/0/0)
tcp        0      0 204.179.131.123:1023    207.33.153.134:22 ESTABLISHED on2 (6455.34/0/0)
If there would at least be a command to reset those times to make the
connection usable again.... This way I have to establish a new connection
to the same host to do something usable.
Sometime back I made a patch to limit the retransmits to a sane level
violating some RFC but cannot locate that one anymore...
