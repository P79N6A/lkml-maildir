I'm not an ELF expert, but simply checking all __init functions in this 
files finds that this seems to be the following:
<--  snip  -->
...
static struct acpi_driver asus_hotk_driver = {
        .name = ACPI_HOTK_NAME,
        .class = ACPI_HOTK_CLASS,
        .ids = ACPI_HOTK_HID,
        .ops = {
                .add = asus_hotk_add,
                .remove = asus_hotk_remove,
                },
};
...
static int __init asus_hotk_add(struct acpi_device *device)
...
