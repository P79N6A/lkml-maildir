fwiw, I'll make this [patch 3/3], so the kernel compiles OK at each step.
This is going to break a lot of external stuff.  We should have found a way
to make usage of SA_* emit deprecated warnings (or _some_ warning) to warn
people of impending doom.  But I can't immediately find a way of doing
that.
If we _can_ find a way of doing this, I suspect we'll need to do it, and
give people another six months.  It's going to get ugly out there.  We
shall see...
