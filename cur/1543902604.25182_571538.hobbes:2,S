Sure thing, it's below.

[PATCH] IDE: fix termination of non-fs requests
ide-disk calls
        ide_end_request(drive, 0, 0);
to finish an unknown request, but this doesn't work so well for non-fs
requests, since ide_end_request() internally looks at ->hard_cur_sectors
to see how much data to end. Only file system requests store a transfer
value in there, pc requests fill out ->data_len as a byte based transfer
value instead.
Since we ask to end 0 bytes of that request, it will never be terminated
and ide-disk gets stuck in a loop "handling" that same request over and
over.
Switch __ide_end_request() to take a byte based transfer count, and
adjust ide_end_request() to look at the right field to determine how
much IO to end when it's being passed in 0.
