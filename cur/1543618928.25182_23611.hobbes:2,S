Notice that the word 'child' is only used in reference to the intial page 
directory copy.  After that things are symmetric with respect to parent and 
child, a fundamental simplification that allows the algorithm to work without 
explicit knowledge of the structure of the mm tree (and also simplifies the 
locking considerably).

Since the page was copied to the child, the child's page table must be 
altered, and since it is shared, it must first be instantiated by the child.  
So after all the dust settles, the parent and child have their own copies of 
a page table page, which differ only at a single location: the child's page 
table points at its freshly made CoW copy, and the parent's page table points 
at the original page.
The beauty of this is, the page table could just as easily have been shared 
by a sibling of the child, not the parent at all, in the case that the parent 
had already instantiated its own copy of the page table page because of an 
earlier CoW.
Confused yet?  Welcome to the club ;-)
