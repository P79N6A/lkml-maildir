This should be moved to Ready.  We've posted 2.5.40 patches,
and the 2.5.41 patches are available at:
	
http://lkcd.sourceforge.net/download/4.2pre/kernel
These have been tested by teams in India and the U.S.  on lots
of different systems.
We'll keep patching them forward until they're incorporated.  We
have fixed Andi Kleen and Randy Dunlap's issues with the 2.5.40
drivers for 2.5.41.  I've also sent a request to Linus to have
them incorporated.  Copying him again.
We're ready to go.
