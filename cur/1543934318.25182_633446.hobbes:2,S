For no binary changes at all, and if going through all those outb_p() users 
anyway, might/could as well just manually split them then:
outb_p() --> outb();
              slow_down_io();
and then just leave out the slow_down_io() call in the non-ISA spots. 
slow_down_io() could be renamed isa_io_delay() or anything (paravirt is a 
little annoying there) if someone cares but then it's a complete identity 
transformation for any driver that does care.
Would IMO also make for a somewhat better API than an isa_outb_p() as 
there's nothing particurly ISA about the outb method itself -- many ISA 
drivers use plain outb() as well.
