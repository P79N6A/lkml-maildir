Nope. But I found another "bugfix" that seems to completely miss the
mark.
For some unknown reason codec->id is set in ac97_probe_codec(), which is
WRONG. Just remove the line that says
	codec->id = ac97_codec_ids[i].id;
(line 591 or something around that), and be happy. I think it will work
after that.
I will now hunt down the person who sent me that patch, and do nasty
things to him. After I whip myself for accepting it in the first place.
Pls tell me if removing that line still doesn't give you sound back,
		Linus
