irresponsible was withdrawing the patch from the public, making a fuss out of it with an
exploit before we really understood it.

Andre's clarity is partially because we don't easily comprehend what he's trying to say,
both sides need to have patience and work through it.

Not all admins are capable of all code functions :)  A great sysadmin knows how to do this.
A good sysadmin knows where to find a great sysadmin to help him ;)  A bad sysadmin turns
the monitor off when something goes wrong and goes for lunch.
I've written code since the z80 and tinier days.  I haven't had time to keep up and be
familiar with the latest and greatest instruction set or how the compiler works tho.  Some
fixes require this knowledge.  I.e. the F00F bug.
