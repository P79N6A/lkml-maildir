There's a missing dependency somewhere, so the y.tab.h file is stale.
If you go into drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm and do a make clean, the
build will work for you.
I'm still trying to figure out exactly what I need to put in the Makefile
to force make to run yacc/bison prior to compiling the scan file.
