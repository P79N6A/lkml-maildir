Could you try what happens without any special options? Default MAC
address, without mii-diag.

Something is wrong.
Are you sure it's a hub? The link partner ability says FullDuplex
capable, it's either a switch or the negotiation produced wrong results.
The natsemi nic advertises 5e1, but the speed is fixed at 100 mbps.
Probably a forced renegotiation after mii-diag changes is missing, and
the forced settings aren't used properly.
I'll look at it.
