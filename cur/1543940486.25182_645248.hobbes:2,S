So the root_domain structure is meant to be the portions of the
sched_domains that are shared across all CPUs in that sched_domain ?
And the word 'cpuset', occurring in the above quote twice, should
be 'sched_domain', right ?  Surely these aren't cpuset's ;).
And 'exclusive cpuset' really means 'non-overlapping sched_domain' ?
Or am I still confused ?
I would like to get our concepts clear, and terms consistent.  That's
important for those others who would try to understand this.
