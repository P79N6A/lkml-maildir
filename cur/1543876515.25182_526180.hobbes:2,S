IIRC a MSI Megabook S270 (I formerly owned) BIOS notifies this
"Critical temperature reached (128C)" when the battery run empty
when the OS did no action due to battery low indications. I guess
the BIOS people thought this is a good last resort to let the OS
really shutdown before the box just turns off.
