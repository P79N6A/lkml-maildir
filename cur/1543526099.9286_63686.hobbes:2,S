umm, those errors come under 2.3, but after reboot to:
2.3: just can't delete directory(i.e. like before reboot)
2.2: ext2 screams, deletes and marks filesystem with errors ( I did not
see log, therefore reported that after reboot its ok)
2.0: the same as 2.2
startup  fsck at 2.0 (after 2.2 marked fs with errors) told about some
refcounts being wrongly 2
besides, there are messages from syslog:
EXT2-fs warning (device ide0(3,5)): ext2_unlink: Deleting nonexistent
file (372905), 0
