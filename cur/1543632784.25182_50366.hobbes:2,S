I think you're right..

Sure. However, I don't think it should come as any surprise to anybody
that trying to write to two different points in the same file is a bad
idea. _regardless_ of whether you do pre-allocation or not, and whether
the pre-allocation is on the inode or file level.
I'd still love to see a "fast and slightly stupid" allocator for both
blocks and inodes, and have some infrastructure to do run-time defragging
in the background.
