I agree - bandwidth allocation is really tricky to do in a useful way.
On one hand, you could "time slice" the disk with some large quanta as 
we would do with a CPU to get some reasonably useful allocation for 
competing, streaming workloads.
On the other hand, this kind of thing would kill latency if/when you hit 
any synchronous writes (or cold reads).
One other possible use for allocation is throttling a background 
workload (say, an interative checker for a file system or some such 
thing) where the workload can run effectively forever, but should be 
contained to not interfere with foreground workloads. A similar time 
slice might be used to throttle this load done unless there is no 
competing work to be done.
