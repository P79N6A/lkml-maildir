I assume you are talking about the iptable_filter module? 
The loss from 45 to 25 percent sounds reasonable.  You add computational 
overhead to the codepath for every packet.  
That initially you only achieve 45% (of what input packet rate?) indicates that
your system is in severe need of tuning.  
Please look through the mailinglist archives to find out about NAPI and
related work.
