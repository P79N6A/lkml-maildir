Yes. ->node_list contains *ALL* nodes, that is why we can:
	#define	plist_for_each(pos, head)	\
		 list_for_each_entry(pos, &(head)->node_list, node_list)
head <=======>  prio=1 <===> prio=2 <===> ...
                 /\        /|  /\
                 |         |   |
                 \/        |   \/
                prio=1     | prio=2
                 /\       /    /\
                 |       /     |
                 \/     /      \/
                prio=1 /      ....
                  <---/
                               /\
Where <===> means ->prio_list, |  ->node_list.
                               \/

Will do. However, I'm unfamiliar with Ingo's tree, so I
can send only new plist's implementation.
