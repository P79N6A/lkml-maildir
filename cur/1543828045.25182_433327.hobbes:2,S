All right, finally this worked out:
git pull rsync://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/smurf/linux-trees.git \
      tag v2.6.17-rc6-mm2
Strange enough with http:// instead of rsync:// I got some message
about nonexistent tag.
Now when I try git pull with http:// again it says the tree is up to
date. However with git:// it started downloading more things and tags.
That's confusing - I believed all protocols should behave the same way...?
