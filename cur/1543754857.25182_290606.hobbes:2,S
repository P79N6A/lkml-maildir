I didn't look at the trace. My only problem is in saving new files. I
can copy an old one, rename it and start, empty it and save fine. I just
can't save new ones.
Anyway, I hope this gets fixed. I am running pure rawhide Fedora Core,
just so you know... latest of everything.

"There are two races of people - men and women - no matter what women's
libbers would have you pretend. The male is motivated by toys and
science because men are born with no purpose in the universe except to
procreate. there is lots of time to kill beyond that...Women, however,
are born with a center. They can create the universe, mother it, teach
it, nurture it. Men read science fiction to build the future. Women
don't need to read it. They are the future." -- Ray Bradbury
