So if fl_ops is set, but fl_ops->fl_release_private isn't, we won't set
fl_ops to NULL -- we should probably just do:
	if (fl->fl_ops && fl->fl_ops->fl_release_private)
		fl->fl_ops->fl_release_private(fl);
	fl->fl_ops = NULL;
	fl->fl_lmops = NULL;

I don't see how fl.fl_ops can be non-null here.  We initialise it to
NULL in locks_init_lock() and then don't give the underlying filesystem
an opportunity to set it.

I know I said I thought file_lock_operations was the right thing to
do ...  but now I think that this isn't a property of the file_lock so
much as it is a property of the underlying filesystem.  I think putting a
lock_operations into struct file is maybe a bit much.  How about adding
a lock_operations pointer to file_operations?  It'd be a little clunky
to get to -- fl->fl_file->f_op->lock_ops, so I'd be interested in other
suggestions.
