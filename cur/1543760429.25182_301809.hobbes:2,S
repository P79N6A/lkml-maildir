Can't we just fix it by havign an alias for both names? It seems stupid to 
jump through hoops and worry about compiler versions, when afaik we could 
just do something like
	extern xxxx(...) __attribute__((alias("yyyy")));
instead. Exact details left to the reader who knows more about all the 
magic gcc/linker things..
