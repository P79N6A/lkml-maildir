Of course it's also possibile to use FIBMAP ioctl:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        int block = 0;
        int fd;
        if (argc < 2)
                return 1;
        fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
        if (fd < 0) {
                perror("open()");
                return 1;
        }
        if (ioctl(fd, FIBMAP, &block)) {
                perror("ioctl()");
                return 1;
        }
        close(fd);
        printf("%d\n", block);
        return 0;
}
Probably it's more script friendly (grepping dmesg? hmmm) ;)
