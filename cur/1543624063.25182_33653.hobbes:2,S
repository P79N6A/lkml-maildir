Hello Alan,
sorry for delayed answer. The machine in question is in production, and I had to find some other test candidate first. So here we go:
1) The problem is reproducable on another hardware with 2.2.21-pre3 client.
2) The problem is reproducable with 2.2.20 either.
What to test next?
Regards,
Stephan
