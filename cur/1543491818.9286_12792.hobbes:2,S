I ran this at various times during the configure (which I have found
to trigger these messages), both before and after the messages
appeared (but probably not during).  They all appeared as follows:
   root@dalles[/home/russell] $ ipcs -a
   ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
   key       shmid     owner     perms     bytes     nattch    status      
   
   ------ Semaphore Arrays --------
   key       semid     owner     perms     nsems     status      
   
   ------ Message Queues --------
   key       msqid     owner     perms     used-bytes  messages    
Not sure what that means.
