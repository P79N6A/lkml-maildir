Hello
Yesterday one of our servers crashed with an oops (syslog attached). It is running kernel 2.6.5 so I don't know if the error is interesting but I thought I send it anyway and let you decide. The server has 2 CPU's and 6 Gb of memory. Still 
the application manages to use 800Mb of swap in addition.
I have included the .config file used to build the kernel.
