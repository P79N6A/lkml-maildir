Only two people ? The core kernel code gets read by several more people
than that it most cases. Drivers is probably more variable, depending on
how common the device is.
One thing that certainly showed up and is much easier to achieve as well
as giving extremely good results is documenting other peoples code. The
documentation process found a lot of driver bugs in Linux and a lot of
bugs in Gnome code too. Not just developer documentation either - user
documentation can have the same effect
