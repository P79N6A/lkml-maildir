How can I use a frame buffer driver's optimized copyarea, fillrect,
blit, etc. from userspace?  The only way I've ever seen anyone use
the frame buffer device is by mmap()ing it and doing everything
manually in the mapped memory.  I assume there must be ioctls for
accessing the accelerated functions, but after several hours of
grepping and googling, I give up. :-(
Any help is greatly appreciated!
