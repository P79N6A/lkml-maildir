Well, i invested much time in helping debugging this stuff. i mounted
three different samba shares with three different methos (passwd via
env, prompt and command line). wait one hour, try to access the
shares ... huh .. no problem ? these were normal shares, so i did
the same with hidden shares ... mounten all three each with a different
passwd method, waited one hour .. huh, no prolem again ? wtf ...
after mounting every share i hooked in via strace and logged all ..
but since there was no  problem in the reconnecting not much
interesting there in.
and what next ? i mounted all my regular shares to work with and *boom*
again, had problem reconnecting (these shares are mixed hiddem/non-hidden
and all passwds via command line [mounting via script]).
Not that i am a fan of Duke Nukem, but: this pisses me on ... ;)
sadly,
	Markus
