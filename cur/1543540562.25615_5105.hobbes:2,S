I have a (probably) dumb question here.  Under the new scheme am I going
to run into difficulties?  I do the following in rc.sysinit:
mver=`uname -r`
rm -rf /lib/modules/default
ln -sf /lib/modules/$mver /lib/modules/default
INITLOG_ARGS= action "Finding module dependencies" depmod -a
and in /etc/modules.conf I have stuff similar to the following:
path[misc]=/lib/modules/default
path[pcmcia]=/lib/modules/default
path[video]=/lib/modules/default
path[fc4]=/lib/modules/default
path[sound]=/lib/modules/default
path[ipv6]=/lib/modules/default
and all such paths in the file are of the same form.
