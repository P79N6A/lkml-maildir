It's not the smp alternatives code, its the one for processor-specific
instructions.  The eip offset for alternative_instructions() in the
trace suggests it is the first call to apply_replacements.  The second
one is the one for the smp alternatives (which doesn't do anything btw
as we patch away the lock prefixes only).
