I have to admit I don't do anything more definite than "wow, this goes oink"...

I'd not be surprised if there's sparse-matrix code out there that wants to
malloc a *huge* array (like a 1025x1025 array of numbers) that then only
actually *writes* to several hundred locations, and relies on the fact that
all the untouched pages read back all-zeros.  Of course, said code is probably
buggy because it doesn't zero the whole thing because you don't usually know
if some other function already scribbled on that heap page.
This would probably be more interesting if we had a userspace API for
"Give me a metric buttload of zero page frames" that malloc() and friends
could leverage.....
