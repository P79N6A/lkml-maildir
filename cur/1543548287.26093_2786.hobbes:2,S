Comments.  You know, these things:
	/* Stuff goes here */
Comments communicate the design intent.  Code communicates the
implementation.  The process of finding discrepancies between these is
known as "debugging".
The process of divining the design intent from the implementation is
known as "a waste of time", and is frequently impossible because of
information loss.
