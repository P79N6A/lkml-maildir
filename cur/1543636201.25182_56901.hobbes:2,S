close() checking is not about physical disk guarantees. It's about more
basic "I/O completed". In some future Linux only close() might tell you
about some kinds of I/O error. The fact it doesn't do it now is no
excuse for sloppy programming

If it bothers you close it again 8)

The man page matches the stsndard. Implementation may be a subset of the
allowed standard right now, but don't program to implementation
assumptions, it leads to nasty accidents
