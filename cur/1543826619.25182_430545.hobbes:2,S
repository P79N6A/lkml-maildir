Hello,
I found that the following code is closing all the open files by the
program, do you think its a bug in kernel code?
------------
fp = tmpfile();
fp->_chain = stderr;
fpclose(fp);
fp = NULL;
------------
o Is there any other elegant way to close all the open files (rather
than reading from /proc/<pid>/fd and calling close on each of the fd?)
Looking forward to hear from you.
Thank you,
Vamsi.
