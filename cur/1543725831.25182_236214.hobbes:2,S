Can udev etc handle the case where you have a parallel zip disk
attached with a passthrough parallel port to the printer?
You can only have one of the lp or ppa drivers loaded at a time, and
that is easy enough to do with autoloading of modules and devfs. It
sounds like this is something which udev wouldn't be able to handle,
and hence would be quite a regression.
(please correct me if I am wrong)
