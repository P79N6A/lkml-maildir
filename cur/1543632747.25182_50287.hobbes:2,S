Yep, I'd say that covers it pretty well.  Lesson learned: rpm 
changenotes are pretty worthless for quickly figuring out what was 
fixed from the perspective of someone who does not follow what the 
various patches encompass/fix.
Thanks for the quick(and helpful!) reply, Stephane.  Earns the award 
for Most Diplomatic, too :-)
Sorry for the waste of time/space/bandwidth, folks!  Thought I had 
done my homework on this one(hey, I even read the bug-reporting faqs 
:-)
