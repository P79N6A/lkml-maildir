You should know better than any other that the problem is not that the
problem itself is the only one affected.  If threads terminate all
other programs and threads are affected since the global locks for the
shared futexes are needed.  That's the case I'm concerned about.  It's
not really about a single app creating many many threads over and over
again.  It's about many apps which do use threads (and that number
will have to rise) starts and stop threads at a reasonable rate.  It's
just one more unnecessary point of contact between concurrently
running apps.
