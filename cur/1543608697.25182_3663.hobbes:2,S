Why? Squeezing into a single cylinder group is _good_. Fragmentation is
bad.
Where's the hell? You move over to the next cylinder group when you have
90% filled one ("pick percentage randomly", and there are others that are
clearly less used.

I don't see any arguments for _why_ you claim it would hurt a lot.
Fast-growth is what we should care about from a performance standpoint -
slow growth can be sanely handled with slower-paced maintenance issues
(including approaches like "defragment the disk once a month").
By definition, "slow growth" is amenable to defragmentation. And by
definition, fast growth isn't. And if we're talking about speedups on the
order of _five times_ for something as simple as a "cvs co", I don't see
where your "pure hell" comes in.
A five-time slowdown on real work _is_ pure hell. You've not shown a
credible argument that the slow-growth behaviour would ever result in a
five-time slowdown for _anything_.
