Dear Colleagues
I think that I was not clear in the last message.
I wrote "clock" but I mean "clock ticks".
In the LINUX system one tick is equal to 10ms.
I want to change this value to 1ms, for example.
"A periodic 10 ms clock tick is problematic for supporting multimedia applications whose time requirements often require a finer granularity."
Then ...
Which is the right procedure ??
Could I find some kind of problem after this modification ??
Once more thank you.
Best regards,
Livia Catarina.
