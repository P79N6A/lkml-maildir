Firstly, in wine the registry is handled by the wineserver process. This means
it can be shared between all the wine processes running for a particular
used. So when wine wants to access the registry, it has to do an RPC call to
the wineserver (sending a request across a UNIX socket and then, I think, a
bit of ptrace()'ing to get at the data). This provides a hopefully more
suitable RPC mechanism.
Secondly, the client (wine) just has to issue a syscall that looks exactly
like a Win32 registry function, how it is handled is hidden by the kernel.
Thirdly, registry functions should issue system handles, as is done on
Windows. If system handles move into the kernel, then registry handles should
do too. This also means registry change notifications can be implemented by
system handles that WaitFor*() functions can deal with.

Yes, but if I implement them to go to a GDI server, which then talks X11 out
the back, that's two lots of RPC calls.
However, what I said about system handles and the registry, may also apply to
GDI objects.

Yes, that is my current plan.

Now there's an idea... Have the local X server as an RPC server, handling wine
GDI calls directly *grin*. Then I could hide all the GDI stuff behind syscall
stubs in the same way. This would allow me to implement a lot of the NT Native
API.
