Yes, I think you understand. Reorderings are possible on reads and
writes. Things get synced up by either an interrupt or a write to
a memory region with a "barrier attribute". Memory allocated with
dma_alloc_coherent() gets the barrier attribute. The idea here is
to allow memory allocated with plain old malloc() or whatever to
get the same attribute.

A write from the device, e.g., when the device writes to indicate
"data DMA is complete".
