I painted with too broad a brush.  I apologize.
I'm afraid i'll never consider shared secrets to be secure.
They may provide privacy but not security.
Jesse's example where confidential information is part of

access to /proc/pid/maps should be restricted and by no
means qualifies for the pejorative i flung so thoughtlessly.
