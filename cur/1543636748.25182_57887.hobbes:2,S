I, for one, would like to have the choice to use the AIX LVM format, and
I'm sure that people thinking of migrating from HP/UX or whatever would
want to be able to add support for their on-disk LVM format.  It really
provides a framework to consolidate all of the partition/MD code into
a single place (e.g. RAID, LVM, LDM (windows NT), DOS, BSD, Sun, etc).
EVMS also allows things like creating snapshots and resizing for
partitions that were not originally set up as LVM volumes (i.e. you can
"upgrade" your existing DOS partitions in-place to support LVM features
instead of requiring a backup/restore cycle.

Even if there is no XFS FSIM module for EVMS, it doesn't mean you can't
use XFS filesystems on EVMS volumes.  The only thing it means is that you
don't get integrated volume+filesystem resize+don't shoot foot support.
