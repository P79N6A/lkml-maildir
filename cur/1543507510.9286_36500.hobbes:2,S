As I understand the problem, if there is a kernel rebuild and the structure
sizes don't change it fails. It will still complain about incompatibility
(because all it checks is the kernel version) even when none of the
interfaces it is using have changed.
When you use it, you can't upgrade your kernel version any more without
recompiling all your loadable modules.
If I've misunderstood this, please correct me. I would like some sort of
compatibility check in the product I'm working on but this one appears to be
too severe.
