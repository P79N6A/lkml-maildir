Let me put it more plainly.  Martin Daleki + rumour assures me that the
blk_size array nowadays measure in blocks not KB, yet to me it seems that
it doesn't.  Look at this code from ll_rw_blk.c in 2.4.13:
 unsigned long maxsector = (blk_size[major][MINOR(bh->b_rdev)] << 1) + 1;
and this comment:
 * blk_size contains the size of all block-devices in units of 1024
 * byte sectors:
so blk_size measures in KB.  Where do I see it wrong? Is everybody
talking about 2.4.14 and 2.4.15? No .. it's just the same in 2.4.14:
 if (blk_size[major])
     minorsize = blk_size[major][MINOR(bh->b_rdev)];
     if (minorsize) {
        unsigned long maxsector = (minorsize << 1) + 1;
KB! Or is it the case that sectors don't mean 512B?
