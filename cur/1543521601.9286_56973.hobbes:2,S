There are only 2 kernels now. 2.2.xx and 2.3.xx. 2.0.xx is somewhat
supported for bug fixes only, and there not much work on it, i think.
When 2.4 is released, active support for 2.2.xx will be dropped anyway.
So there will be only 2 kernels, 2.4.xx and 2.5.xx.

2.0.xx is still in used because diff -r 2.0 2.2 is SO big! There are
years of development of many people. And production boxes need no upgrade,
but for (some) bugfixes. It my DNS server works well under 2.0.38, why
change it?
In pure theory, new drivers should appear only in odd numeber releases,
*before* a feature-freeze. Thanks to the high level of modularity which
the Linux design allows, it's possibile to include some drivers later,
even in the stable branch. But note this is necessary only because there is
a rather long time when the only available kernel for developers is
the "stable" one (forgetting of old releases, and assuming that a post
feature-freeze kernel is NOT avalable for developing). 
Of course you have access to old kernels, too.
No one prevents me to write my new distributed-journaled-autorepairing-
autocompressing-autodefragging FS based on 0.99p17, but it think i'll
find some difficulties in porting it to 2.5. B-) 
I simply think that *at any time* we should have only 2 kernels:
STABLE and DEVEL. Right now, i would call STABLE the 2.2.xx and DEVEL
2.3.xx, but i'm proposing to switch ASAP to the state where STABLE is
2.4pre and DEVEL is 2.5.
Developers just work on the DEVEL tree. Right now, spawning a 2.5 tree
will cost nothing to developers, as their under-development drivers will
work just fine under 2.5. Otherwise, if they have an almost stable driver,
they will follow 2.3's way to 2.4. If the decide to go for a 2.2 driver,
or a 2.0 driver, they're on their own anyway. Having a small number
of very different kernels (as 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 are now), or many kernels
with smaller changes makes no difference from the developer's point of
view. Supporting more than one kernel will be easier. Supporting many of
them will be a big job anyway.

That's good. If they're adding something new, let's have them jump
directly to 2.5. If their code is stable, they have to maintain it
anyway for 2.4. If they don't, it's their fault.
Alan is not in charge of every piece of code in 2.2.xx.
If some device driver has a bug, let the author fix it. If Alan fixes it,
we thank him, but he's not expected to do so. The core of 2.2.xx should be
completely bug-free (in theory): Alan should just fix bugs that did't
show up in the test phase of 2.2.xx. The same goes for 2.4. It should be
bug-free, or at least that's the goal. My idea is that no kernel development
work should be done on 2.4. Just bug fixing. We can't prevent people
from doing what they want, but we can offer them a better choice, 2.5.
Right now, they have no choice: they're working on 2.3, which (at this
point) is just 2.4 under another name.

Exactly. Well, i'm not going to do that. There's a guy out there who showed
excellent capacity in doing that. And it's named Linus.
Such a tree needs someone who knows Linus' mind, since some changes
in 2.5 will be major ones, and probably Linus is already thinking about that.
Many will be design issue. I can't simply do that. I don't know enough
of the kernel to have ideas on it. Someone else could, but those ideas
are likely to be different from Linus' ones.

It's not that simple. Developers "will be spending their time stableizing
2.4.x" if they have something to make stable. But if they're in first
stages of their work, either they stop, or they work against 2.4. And later
this year we will have "The Most Requested Feature of the List" that works
fine on 2.4 and does not even compile on 2.5.

And their work won't go in 2.5 easily. I'm not foreseeing that.
That's history. People developed against 2.0 and had problems in 
porting their work to 2.1. The same happened with 2.2 and 2.3.

No, sorry i don't see you point. Call it "linux-DEVEL" if you don't
like "2.5". I don't see the need of more than one devel tree. And
i've never said that (or at least never meant that).
And just compiling Linus with SMP support enabled won't help? B-)

Agreed. Right now, given the great number of changes in 2.3/4, there's
a lot of work in making it stable. But it thinks this comes from
it's late release as 2.3, and late commitment towards 2.4.
I'm proposing the 2.5 spawn to avoid this to happen again at 2.6 time.

It's even more funny. Having a "marked experimental" feature added later
to the stable kernel, i mean.
If it means 2.5.x, pressure will make 2.4 patches appear everywhere.
Unless we can have 2.5.x tomorrow (well, i don't mean exactly 24 hours...).
Early 2.5.xx, with ext3 and ReiserFS, will be usable, but still "marked
as experimental". People will test them, and they will go smoothly in 2.6.
IMHO, first stages of 2.5.xx should aim towards the integration of 
pieces of code which were not ready for 2.4. Then, we can have a 2.5.xx
which is quite stable (as 2.3 is now) and appealing to testers.
Then make all the changes you want, and later make it stable again ready
for 2.6. Just some time later you announce the 2.5 feature-freeze,
spawn 2.7.

Ext3 was just an example. Anyway, the problem is the presence of a
devel tree. There won't be any for a while, since focus is on
making 2.3/4 stable.

But any changes to 2.5 that may be relevant to ext3 will show up
now, not at the time Ext3 is ready for inclusion. Really, i don't
care much of Ext3, or any other "missing" features. What i need is
ALI support, and i'm pretty comfortable on patching my kernel with
it. I'm not asking for Ext3.

Of course. I've never asked for it. Please, just because so many
people do ask for it, don't assume i'm doing the same. They ask
for a STABLE kernel (2.4) with Ext3 in it. I'm asking for a 2.5 spawn.
Completely unrelated (unless you're wondering why Ext3 or other
things are marked as "usable" under 2.2, and not ready for 2.3:
they were developed under 2.2, for the lack of an earlier 2.3).

I'd do, if what i needed is just Ext3. But, really, i don't care.
I don't agree things are going on at the best they could. And
it has nothing to do with revision control software or the like.
You said that we're free to add patches to the kernel, but it's true
that we (actually YOU, i've never made up a patch myself, apart from
making broken NE2000 card work, and a one-liner to a ISDN driver)
also need a kernel to patch. Of course you can patch the kernel you like,
even 0.97p13, but it think that a devel kernel should be always there.
Sometime it should spawn a -stable branch, just to make people happy.
And this should happen more often that it happened with 2.0, 2.2 and
(is going to happen with) 2.4.
