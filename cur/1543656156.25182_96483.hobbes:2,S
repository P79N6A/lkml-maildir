Yep, the 'siblings' value is the number of virtual processors in the
physical package.
Do you only see one processor listing in /proc/cpuinfo, though?  You
should see one for each (virtual) processor.  That means two in a single
HT-enabled P4, each with the same physical id.
So it seems your chip works... is the kernel compiled for SMP?
