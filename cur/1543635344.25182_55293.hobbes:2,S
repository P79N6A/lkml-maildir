	Hello! Has anyone experience with removing CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability 
in the recent 2.4 kernels? I searched around to look for real life 
examples, but the only definitive answer seems to be that X breaks. 
From my head, other candidates to breaking are things like hwclock 
and setserial, maybe i am wrong? 
Thanks,
Pedro
