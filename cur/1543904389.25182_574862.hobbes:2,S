    I acn undertand your complaint in the context of an OF driver (which we 
don't have yet) but "mmio-ide" just means nothing to the current driver, and 
it doesn't convery enough info on the programming interface for the 
conceivable OF driver, it also does need to know at least "reg-stride" (and 
maybe "reg-size" in case only 16/32-bit accesses can be used).  Well, if such 
driver will be written, I/O mapping support will probably be dropped from it, 
so indeed, calling it mmio-ide.c would make sense.  But that can be added when 
this driver is done, and for now I'd really prefer the board name to appear in 
the "compatible" prop (to which "mmio-ide" can be appended)...
