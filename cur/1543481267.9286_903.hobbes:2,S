I seem to have the same problem with ppp in the 2.1 and 2.2 kernels.  The only
difference is you say the ISP sends back a ConfRej, whereas my ISP doesn't send
any acknowledgement to my Reqs at all.  I still ConfAck its ConfReqs, however. 
If anyone has ANY idea on how to fix this, PLEASE let us know.  I am terribly
excited to move on to the 2.2 and soon to come 2.3 kernel series, but without
working ppp, I'll be stuck with 2.0 forever!
If anyone needs more info on this problem, email me directly.  I have taken
several notes on the issue but won't include them here so as not to annoy. :)
Thanks.
