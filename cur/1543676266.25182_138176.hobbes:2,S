Hello Gregoire,

Are you sure you have used the v4l2 "videodev.o" (backported from 2.5) 
that comes from the "build-2.4" directory from the "dvb-kernel" cvs tree?

This looks suspicious...
Please do a

If you have a "videodev.o" in .../kernel/drivs/media/video, then this 
will be used. But this is the plain old 2.4 video4linux-*1* videodev 
module, which does not work in conjunction with the "dvb-kernel" CVS 
driver, which needs the 2.5 video4linux-*2* videodev.

Please don't CC the linux kernel mailing list the next time, since this 
is a dvd only issue. Thanks!
