Agreed.

Agreed.

That's something to watch out for...If you say have:
printk(KERN_DEBUG "fooo.....");
do_foo();
printk(KERN_DEBUG "done.\n");
Then, you'll get the extra "<7>" on the screen and in the logs (assuming
you set the printk levels to display KERN_DEBUG).
Now, I'm not 100% sure about '\r', but I suspect it does the same thing.

No, read the patch carefully, it uses '\r' to go back to the begining of
the line and overwrites the message.
