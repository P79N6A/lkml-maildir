Okay, but.  IRQs are scarce.  With previous kernels I was able
to use IRQ 9 for other things without any obvious problems.
Perhaps this is only because I don't have ACPI support enabled.
Still, if I disable ACPI support then shouldn't I be able to use
IRQ 9 for other things?  If so, shouldn't the kernel to refrain
from reserving this IRQ?
