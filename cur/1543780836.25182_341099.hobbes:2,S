My name is Ali Waheed, A Bahrain  national I have been diagnosed with 
Oesophageal
cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have 
only about a few  months
to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 
anyone(not even
myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was 
always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the 
only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there  
is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the 
world. I
believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live 
my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called 
me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate 
and extended family members as well as a  few close friends .I want God to 
be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to 
charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do 
on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations in 
the U.A.E, Somalia  and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so 
badly, I cannot do  this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family 
to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to 
charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the 
money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to 
be contended with what I have leftfor them. The last of my money which no 
one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen Million 
dollars($18,000,000,00) that I have with a finance House abroad. I will want 
you to help me collect this deposit and despatch it to charity 
organizations.
N/B:KINDLY NOTE THAT 20% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims and 
another 10% for your effort and time.
Regards,
Mr.Ali Waheed.
