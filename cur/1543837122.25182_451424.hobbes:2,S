IMO, we don't need to worry about the kernel internal data structures in
the first pass of container support.  I agree that something like dcache
can grow to consume a meaningful amount of memory in a system, but I
still think if we can have something more simple to start with that can
track user memory (both anon and pagecache) will be a good start.

I think adding a pointer to struct page brings additional cost without
that much of additional benefit.  Doing it at the address_space/anon_vma
level for page_cache is useful.

Before we go and say that we need hierarchy of containers, we should
have a design of what a container should be containing.  AFAICS, flat
containers should be able to do the job.
But in general, if a container is getting aborted, then any residual
resources should also be aborted where ever make sense(may mean flushing
of any page_cache pages) or the operation should not be permitted.

hmm, probably the changes to core mm are not going to be that intrusive.
The catch will be what happens when you hit the limit of memory assigned
to a container.
