But in the end isn't that more complicated than our approach?  The
kernel still needs to be modified to let processes request their pids,
and now processes have to worry *always* about the value or range of
their pids, both at startup and restart.  In the pidspace approach,
processes simply have a concept of starting a new pidspace, after
which the rest of the system processes are effectively gone as far as
this pidspace is concerned, and, other than that, processes continue
as normal.  Upon restart, they do have to reclaim their vpids, either
from userspace, or through in-kernel restart code.
