oprofile uses register_timer_hook() for its oh-crap-nothing-else-works
fallback iirc.  It's a useful fallback: I used it a few centuries ago on
some el-cheapo VIA CPU-based thing we had at Digeo.
It's unclear to me whether all this stuff works with NO_HZ=y, btw.  Didn't
we just lose the regular timer interrupts which these clients depend upon?
