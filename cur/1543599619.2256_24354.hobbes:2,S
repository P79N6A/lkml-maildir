Hi,
I did an "rmmod minix" to remove the minix module from the kernel
and then tried to mount the partition on a mount point using minix
filesystem. I gave the command 
mount -t minix /dev/sdb1 /dummy....
.but found that it got mounted without
error, though I have already removed the minix module from the kernel. So
again I unmounted the fs and took an strace of the same command and a part
of the output was the following:
-----------------------
lstat("/etc/mtab", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=118, ...}) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, ~[TRAP SEGV], NULL, 8) = 0
 mount("/dev/sdb1","/dummy", "minix", 0xc0ed0000, 0) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not i mplemented)
mount("/dev/sdb1", "/dummy", "minix", 0xc0ed0000, 0) = -1 ENOSYS (Function
not i mplemented)
 mount("/dev/sdb1", "/dummy", "minix", 0xc0ed0000, 0) = 0
---------------------------
In the above it succeds only the third time. 
My doubts are:
1. How did the kernel get the minix filesystem when I have already removed
the module from the kernel?
2. Where does the modules get loaded from when we use an insmod? Is it
from "/lib/modules/<kernel version>/fs/" for the filesystem?
Please help me with the answer.
Thanks in advance,
A
Warm regards,
