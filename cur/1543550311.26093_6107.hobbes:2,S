.bashrc is only read for interactive shells.  Besides, if which is a bash
alias as well,
$ command -v which
alias which='type -path'
$
it will break too,
$ which which
$
I think what you can do is to ignore the value returned by command -v, and
just use it is an indication that this thing exists.  After all, if you can
find it using command -v, just calling it will work too.  Something like
if command -v gcc272 > /dev/null 2> /dev/null; then echo gcc272; else \
echo gcc; fi
