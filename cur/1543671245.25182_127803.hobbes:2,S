Works *very* well. I now have sound. I'd recommend adding the ALSA 
documentation from 2.5.x to the patch. It is easier than trying to 
navigate through alsa-project.org for setup information. It would be 
nice if ALSA was placed into 2.4.x as soon as possible. Doesn't require 
any extra patches beyond the ones for the kernel.
Thanks for the help!
