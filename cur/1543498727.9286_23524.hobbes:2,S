Why I must keep NR_CPU slots ??
Processor and mm info are taken in account in goodness() calculation that
called as:
goodness(tsk, tsk, tsk->processor);
<<<< This means max mm goodness ( tsk->mm == tsk->mm ) and
max SMP goodness ( same processor ) >>>>
give the higher result and hence ensure that no process in slot (N - 1) will
give a goodness greater then one in slot N.
When at the end of a slot computation is executed this code:
...
  /* Goodness promise has been maintained, we've found the President ! */
  if (c >= SLOT_GDS_BASE(ii))
   goto task_found;
...
we are sure, having task in slot N maintained his "promise", that we can
skip out
with the right process for the previous definition.

I can agree here.
I'll code a new version with linux lists.

Andrea having tasks doing for(;;); is not a common environment to test,
isn't it ?
Anyway my algo has a cost near to O(1) while the previous as a cost of O(N)
where N is running tasks.

Agree.
I'll correct this behaviour.
Cheers,
