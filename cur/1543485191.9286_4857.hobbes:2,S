	Because doing it twice means that server going ballistic will not
leave client's dcache in inconsistent state. Be conservative in what you
send and all such. Indeed, checks must be done on server's side *too*.

	There is a kinder serialization and I'll probably do it in the
final variant anyway - instead of holding a per-fs semaphore we use
wait queue and can do the following (instead of down/is_subdir stuff):
retry:
	fence=new_dentry;
	while( !IS_ROOT(fence) && fence!=old_dentry && !(fence->d_flags &
D_SOURCE))
		fence = fence->d_parent;
	if (fence == source)
		return -EINVAL;
	if (fence == root)
		goto everything_clear;
	for ( p=old_dentry; p!=fence && !IS_ROOT(p); p=p->d_parent)
		;
	if (p!=fence) {
		sleep_on(&sb->s_vfs_rename_wait);
		goto retry;
	}
everything_clear:
	old_dentry->d_flags |= D_SOURCE;
	/* do rename */
	old_dentry->d_flags &= ~D_SOURCE;
	wake_up(&sb->s_vfs_rename_wait);
That's it. In other words, we find the closest ancestor of target that is
source of some rename in progress (catching is_subdir() cases in the same
loop) or is root. Then if it is the ancestor of source too we can go ahead
since this rename() is commutative with all renames already in progress.
Otherwise we'll have to wait for some of them to finish and recheck the
conditions later. That way we can guarantee that fs will never receive a
rename() request that is not independant from all requests already in
progress. This scheme is finer than 'no concurrent renames within the same
fs' one.

	Certainly, for networking filesystem you have to do checks on
server's side *anyway*. Hell, not to mention races, clients may be
compromised, go mad, whatever.

	I know. The point being, you can leave to the server all checks
that do not affect the consistency of client's state, but leaving *all*
checks to the server is calling for trouble.
