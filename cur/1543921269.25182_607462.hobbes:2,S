the get_irq_regs() approach worked out really well. We should do a 
get_irq_nr() and be done with it?
(Then once the mechanic conversion has been done we could eliminate all 
uses of get_irq_nr() and remove the small overhead it takes to maintain 
this per-cpu value in the irq entry layer.)
full ACK on the concept from me too. Please go ahead! :)
