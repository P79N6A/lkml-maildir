Yes, it's another nagging email from me. Once again I'm not a
subscriber so direct replies to me.  Some odd ide-scsi behavior here.
When I modprobe ide-scsi, I get this:
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
scsi : 1 host.

Naturally I only have one CD-Writer ;)
Looking at proc/scsi/scsi shows that the writer is luns 0 through 7 on
Channel 0, ID 0 of host scsi0.  Fine.  Why do i have it on 8 luns?  It's
even better when i insmod sr_mod and now scd0 through scd7 are all the
writer.
Thanks again,
Joseph Gooch
