Why default to incompatibility?! If the user explicitly says "I really do want
a kernel which only works on this specific machine as it is now, and I want it
to break otherwise", fine. Don't make it a default!
BTW: Has anyone benchmarked the different optimizations - i.e. how much
difference does optimizing for a Pentium make when running on a PII? More to
the point, how about optimizing non-exclusively for a Pentium, so the code
still runs on earlier CPUs?
