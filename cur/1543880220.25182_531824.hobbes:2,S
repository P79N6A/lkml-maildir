That was not the claim. Rather, that intelligence agencies have a very
strong need for privacy, and will go to greater lengths to get it,
including using MLS systems. I contend that while most organizations
want privacy, they don't want it so badly that they will put up with
MLS, and so are looking for a more tolerable form of security.
This is relevant here because information flow is the main advantage of
labels over pathnames for access control. AppArmor does not attempt to
manage information flow, allowing it to use pathnames to achieve ease of
use. If you want information flow control, then by all means use a
label-based system.
