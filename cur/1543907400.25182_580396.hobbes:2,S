Subject: CONFIG_SWAP=n failes to compile due to linux/pagemap.h issues

-Werror-implicit-function-declaration made it finally into mainline,
thats ok.
But now CONFIG_SWAP=n fails to compile, at least on powerpc:
include/asm-generic/tlb.h: In function 'tlb_flush_mmu':
include/asm-generic/tlb.h:76: error: implicit declaration of function 'release_pages'
include/asm-generic/tlb.h: In function 'tlb_remove_page':
include/asm-generic/tlb.h:105: error: implicit declaration of function 'page_cache_release'
tlb_flush_mmu() calls free_pages_and_swap_cache(),
which calls free_pages_and_swap_cache() in linux/swap.h
A commend was added to the free_pages_and_swap_cache define the last
time this issue came up. sparc can not use linux/pagemap.h in swap.h.

So, how can this be finally resolved?
Does CONFIG_SWAP=n compile anywhere right now?
google found a workaround(?), akpm queued it up:
