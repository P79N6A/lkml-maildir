Ages ago I grabbed a different one for fixing up BK.  Here's what I've
got now that fixes up both (and munges the date on git, which may or may
not turn out to be useful).
#!/bin/sh
TMP=`mktemp /tmp/setfrom.XXXXXX`
cat > $TMP
## Old BitKeeper logic
from=`grep '^ChangeSet' $TMP | head -1 | awk '{print $NF}'`
## New git logic
author=`sed -n '/^author /p' < $TMP | head -n 1`
if [ ! -z "$author" ]; then
  from=`echo $author | sed 's/author \(.*>\).*/\1/'`
  date=`echo $author | sed 's/author.*> //'`
fi
if test -n "$from" -a -n "$date"; then
  formail -I "From: $from" -I "Date: `date -d "$date" -R`" < $TMP
else
  if test -n "$from"; then
    formail -I "From: $from" < $TMP
  else
    cat $TMP
  fi
fi
rm $TMP
