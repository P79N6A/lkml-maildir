FYI:  doesn't seem to fail with 23-rc6.

This is a 16-cpu, 4-node, 32GB HP rx8620.  The test load that I'm
running is Dave Anderson's "usex" with a custom test script that runs:
5 built-in usex IO tests to a separate file system on a SCSI disk.
1 built-in usex IO rate test -- to/from same disk/fs.
1 POV ray tracing app--just because I had it :-)
1 script that does "find / -type f | xargs strings >/dev/null" to
pollute the page cache.
2 memtoy scripts to allocate various size anon segments--up to 20GB--
and mlock() them down to force reclaim.
1 32-way parallel kernel build
3 1GB random vm tests
3 1GB sequential vm tests
9 built-in usex "bin" tests--these run a series of programs
from /usr/bin to simulate users doing random things.  Not really random,
tho'.  Just walks a table of commands sequentially.
This load beats up on the system fairly heavily.
I can package up the usex input script and the other associated scripts
that it invokes, if you're interested.  Let me know...
