I'm travelling right now, and somehow managed to oops my home router
3000 miles away making it hard for me to access mail & stuff.
(That "page count went negative" BUG() bit me when I did a killall -9 vpnc)
Full bug report, and processing of this backlog will happen
as soon as I get back on Sunday :)
