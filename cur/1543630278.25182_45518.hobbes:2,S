That doesn't work for shared mappings over holes.  Unfortunately.
Yes, credentials cache a-la 4.4BSD would help in many cases, but
we have no reasonably credentials when kswapd writes a dirty page
on disk.  It _can_ cause allocations.  And many processes might've
touched that page until it finally got written out - which credentials
would you use?
