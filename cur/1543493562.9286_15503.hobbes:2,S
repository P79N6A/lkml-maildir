IMHO  128ms is a pretty huge difference and should almost never happen.
and if it happens, waiting 1/2 hour shouldn't be a problem (as it
never happens anywy -- per definition;)
and at powerup you first should use ntpdate or similar to step the clock then.

NO, that's _WAY_ too large!  if you're trying to do some timing/benchmark
in this period you'd get 5% error just because of tickadj.  
IMHO that's completely out of range!  waiting a bit longer to get clocks
in sync is much preferable than to risk 5% errors in timing/sleep intervals 
etc.
