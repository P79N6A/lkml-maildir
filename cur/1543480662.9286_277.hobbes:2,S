	Me too: i had to recover my old kerneld from modutils 2.1.85 and
install it instead of 2.1.121. Rest of binaries work fine in newer version
with 2.0 and 2.2 kernels
	No problem at all: in rc.kerneld just test about kernel version: if
in 2.0.X just use "kerneld". in 2.[12].X use "kmod" 
( I had to make a little trick to manage conf.modules, but a minor problem. )
