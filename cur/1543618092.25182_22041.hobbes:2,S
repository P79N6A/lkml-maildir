the exact log i get:
Creating 3 MTD partitions on "SA1100 flash":      
0x00000000-0x00040000 : "bootldr"
mtd: Giving out device 0 to bootldr 
0x00040000-0x02000000 : "root" 
mtd: Giving out device 1 to root 
0xc2000000-0xc4000000 : "rd" 
mtd: partition "rd" is out of reach -- disabled
notes:
1. the flash is at physical adress 0-0x1ffffff (32mb)
2. the ram is at physical adress 0xc0000000-0xc3ffffff
i tried to map an mtd device to the second part of the ram, but got
"partition is out of reach"
any idea ?
