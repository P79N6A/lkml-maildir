Hello,
currently I compile kernel for 12 different machines. I would like to see 
profile support in kernel, so I could have all my .configs in source and 
compile them in one shot. and than see in profile directory subdirectories 
for every config with it's vmlinuz and modules.
I think it would speedup also compilation time because some .o should be than 
reuse.
Thanks a lot for reply
Michal
