I know I misunderstand things occasionally, but it looks ok to
me.  Isn't that just an artifact of the diff/patch thing?  I simply
added sb.o to the line when I edited it.  That's the way I've always
seen diff act.  It deletes the original line and adds in an identical
line with what I added in.  The second line above adds in an identical
line with sb.o added to the line.

No there isn't a runtime problem.  Linus went through a phase recently
where he forced people to clean up "warnings" during the compile
stage.  If you answer yes to both CONFIG_SOUND_PAS and CONFIG_SOUND_SB
you get "warinings" like this:
/mnt/hd/src/linux-2.3.99pre/Rules.make:267: target `uart401.o' given
more than once in the same rule.
My change eliminates that by eliminating the need to include both.  It
also makes thing clearer IMHO.

Modprobe seems cleaner to me.  It's an opinion and it's in my docfile so
I didn't see it as that big of a deal.
