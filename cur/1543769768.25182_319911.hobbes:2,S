Well for me it return an error since you're missing a "do" before
the echo :)
However, with that addition I've tried a number of shells including
bash and they all work as expected.  So please do
strace -f sh -c 'while read line; do echo $line; done < /proc/net/route'
as that should give us the necessary clue.
Cheers,
