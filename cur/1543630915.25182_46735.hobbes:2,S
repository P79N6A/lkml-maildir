Subject: [patch 5/15] reiserfs locking fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

reiserfs is using b_inode_buffers and fsync_buffers_list() for
attaching dependent buffers to its journal.  For writeout prior to
commit.
This worked OK when a global lock was used everywhere, but the locking
is currently incorrect - try_to_free_buffers() is taking a different
lock when detaching buffers from their "foreign" inode.  So list_head
corruption could occur on SMP.
The patch implements a reiserfs_releasepage() which holds the
journal-wide buffer lock while it runs try_to_free_buffers(), so all
those list_heads are protected.  The lock is held across the
try_to_free_buffers() call as well, so nobody will attach one of this
page's buffers to a list while try_to_free_buffers() is running.
