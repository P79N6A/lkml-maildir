This isn't a HURD feature.
This isn't even a C library feature.
This is a Linux feature.
So the _GNU_SOURCE thing is just plain wrong. Quit trying to
rename the OS.
Since there are so many standards to choose from, putting all features
into the default would be most obvious. Else what, pure C89 maybe?
Dang new-fangled standards might break something. Normal UNIX systems
don't make developers jump through hoops to get access to stuff; they
instead provide clean namespaces upon request.
