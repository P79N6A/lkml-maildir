Of cource he doesn't have to do that. It is just nice to have all of them.

Alien does an excellent job in converting some packages, but for others
including pre/post installation scripts (with -c) conversion is not
perfect. The reason is not a problem with alien, but most RPMs assumes
(correcly) that the target system is `RedHat like'.
The reason I was looking for the debian package was to test 2.4 on a
"stable" debian system. If I install modutils from source, package
management system (dpkg/apt) will not know its existence.
