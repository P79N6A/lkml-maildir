Hi All!
I've got only one problem with this driver.
It's appear when I remove module and try to probe it again, then
modprobe oopsing. Problem lays somewhere under PCI_HACK.
It have been repaired in 2.5.55 with this patch
Dave Jones <davej@codemonkey.org.uk>:
  o Fix up dma_alloc_coherent with 64bit DMA masks on i386
OK. I've just tested it. It's been fixed.
         Ruslan.
