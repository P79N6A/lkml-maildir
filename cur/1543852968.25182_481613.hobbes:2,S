so it never worked? (that's important to know versus regression)
Also does this machine use ACPI for interrupt routing?
That's also important, because if you're NOT using ACPI, "noapic" means
that you're using the PIRQ for irq routing and not MPS, so you're not
"just" changing apic behavior, you're actually using a different BIOS
table. (and to be honest, a buggy bios table is more likely the
cause ... ;)
