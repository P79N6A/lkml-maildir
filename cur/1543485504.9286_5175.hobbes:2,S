	Erm??? SunOS 5.6 (both on tmpfs and NFS) doesn't allow "../foo"
just as it doesn't allow ".". And yes, it does allow rmdir of busy
directory. Looking at the 4.4BSD code it seems that they have the same
behaviour (I'm not on *BSD box right now).

	Hmm... Fine. In this case we'll need to mess with lookup() -
after it there is no trace of . in the name. That is, one more flag to
pass... Arrghhh... Linus, would you mind switching to nameidata mechanism?
That is, instead of (OK, in addition to) namei() and friends the following 
thing:
a) initialize the structure describing lookup request (name, flags a-la
lookup/create/remove, follow, etc., root dentry, current dentry) with a
macro
b) pass it to new_namei().
	It looks like the right thing anyway (e.g. completely iterative
symlink resolution) and amount of flags already looks messy. I can roll
such patch - it doesn't break anything that still uses old mechanism and
it's fairly trivial to write. BTW, it would be able to do final-step
checks (sticky, etc. - current may_delete()/may_create() stuff).
	If it comes to the need of special parsing on the last step - why
not tell to poor thing what we want to do with dentry it will give us?
