No I disagree, they are totally right. They stop crashes walking the
list during a hotplug of another card. If you hotplug the moxa or rio
card you are screwed. Your patches solve a different problem to the ones
the pci_dev_get changes solve.
Your changes also minimally handle the hotplug of the moxa or rio card
which I guess could theoretically happen in some weird system and are a
definite improvement.
