Wouldn't a developer of a real-time system configure the system so
that interrupts do not interfere with the real-time tasks running on a
specific CPU?
In other words, is this problem not simply a misconfiguration of the system?
I personally redirect all interrupts away from the CPU's where my
real-time tasks run and only allow the interrupts that I want to
handle in my application on the CPU's where I handle them so as to
minimize latency.
