I originally didn't realize that we already represent devices on the
subordinate bus as subdirectories of the bridge device's directory,
without any extra level of abstraction. So it probably makes sense
to put the bus-specific files there or, in case of a root bus, to
/sys/devices/pciXXXX:YY/.
				Have a nice fortnight
