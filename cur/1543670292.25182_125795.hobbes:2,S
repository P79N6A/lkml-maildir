Hi,
I'm not an expert in kernel compilation but I had this problem :
keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?
keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?
My system is as follows :
- Dell dimension 8250
- P4 3.06 with HT (enabled in bios)
- 512 RDRAM
- DD Ide 120 Go
- ATI Radeon 9700 Pro
- Debian with lastest packages
This problem occurs with a 2.4.20 kernel. With the basic 2.2.20 provided in
the woody, the system works without problems.
The thing really odd is when using a 2.4.20 patched kernel for gentoo, I've
got the keyboard working but the X don't let me use my keyboard either my
mouse.
I also tried using a 2.4.21-pre7 without success.
I'm open to any suggestions ;)
PS : my kernel is compiled with SMP support and my keyboard and mouse are
PS/2.
I didn't subscribe to the lkml so If you would be nice enough to send me
answer by mail.
Thank you.
