It didn't say "more standard". It referred to "the standard C99 types".
It's heading off the question "why object to ifdefs but permit _these_
gratuitous ones?" which would otherwise be asked.
It's a document which is _describing_ the Linux coding style. To refer
to u32 et al as 'standard' would be self-referential. Describe them as
'the Linux standard types' in other documents by all means, but it
doesn't make much sense to do so in Documentation/CodingStyle.
