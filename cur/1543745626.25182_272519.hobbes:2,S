I'm not talking about allyesconfig.
The Kconfig file should express all dependencies of a driver.
If a driver doesn't compile, it should not be selectable - and not 
#error at compile time.
Rethinking it, perhaps the following expresses the dependencies best:
  depends on ... && XIP_KERNEL && (ARCH_SA1100 || ARCH_PXA || BROKEN)
This would push the #error as a dependency on BROKEN to the Kconfig 
file.
