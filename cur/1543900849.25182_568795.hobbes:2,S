Most mid-range and high end arrays actually use that battery to insure that data 
is all written out to permanent media when the power is lost. I won't go into 
how that is done, but it clearly would not be a safe assumption to assume that 
your power outage is only going to be a certain length of time (and if not, you 
would lose data).

I worked on the team that designed that big array.
At one point, we had an array on loan to a partner who tried to put it in a very 
small data center. A few weeks later, they brought in an electrician who needed 
to run more power into the center.  It was pretty funny - he tried to find a 
power button to turn it off and then just walked over and dropped power trying 
to get the Symm to turn off.  When that didn't work, he was really, really 
confused ;-)
