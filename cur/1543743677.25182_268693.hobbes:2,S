	It is based precisely on the idea that that is enforceable
that the FSF created an LGPL distinct from the GPL and also why it makes
a special exception for your type of use toward the end of section 3:

	I've seen messages that say quite the opposite.  Besides,
Linus is not the only copyright holder.  It only takes one copyright
for someone to be infringing.
	Again, I'm not a lawyer, so please don't take this as legal
advice.
