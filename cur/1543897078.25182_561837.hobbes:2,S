that isn't so easy. Anything which doesn't have a performance tradeoff
is in -O2 already. So every single thing in -Os costs you performance on
a micro level.
The translation to macro level depends greatly on how things are used
(you even have to factor in download times etc)... so that is a fair
question to leave up to the user... which is what there is today.
