May be the following experiences are relevant:
- a Pentium MMX 200 MHz with burned L1 cache. It was worse than a 386 with
turbo switch turned off (didn-t have time to measure bogomips, just had it
replaced). 
- a PIII 850 with L2 cache turned off appeared comparable to a 433
MHz Celeron (860 BogoMips) while with L2 cache turned on it showed 1684
BogoMips.
So that would confirm that the snaillike behaviour of your systems has
something to do with either _burned_ of disabled L1 cache, not L2 cache.
