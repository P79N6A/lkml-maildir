You mean POSIX compliance is impossible?  So what?  It is possible to
implement an approximation that is _at least_ as good as samefile().
One really dumb way is to set st_ino to the 'struct inode' pointer for
example.  That will sure as hell fit into 64bits and will give a
unique (alas not stable) identifier for each file.  Opening two files,
doing fstat() on them and comparing st_ino will give exactly the same
guarantees as samefile().

4 billion files, each with more than one link is pretty far fetched.
And anyway, filesystems can take steps to prevent collisions, as they
do currently for 32bit st_ino, without serious difficulties
apparently.
