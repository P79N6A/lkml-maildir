That would remove process invocation from the kernel path.
You could do a lot of *this* in user space by having a library function
set the default value for all signals, or just SIGSEGV, to a function
that uses some kind of IPC, such as writing to a fifo whose name includes
the uid.  I wonder if it's possible to use preloading to inject that
snippet of code into an existing executable without relinking it and
without touching libc.
