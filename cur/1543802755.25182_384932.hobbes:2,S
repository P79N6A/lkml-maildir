I really hoped where would be a question before if there were outstanding 
issues.

The whole resolution issue is still outstanding. It basically assumes 
already high resolution timer and makes it hard to allow simple low 
resolution timer.
The rounding is broken for relative timer started on low resolution 
clocks. The run_hrtimer_queue() calls get_time() every interrupt, wasting 
time if that call should be slow (and could be avoided completely for low 
resolution timers).
I haven't even gotten to a number of small issues, because it's impossible 
to discuss even the general issues with Thomas. :-(
bye, Roman
