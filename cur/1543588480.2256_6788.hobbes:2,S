Good!

We should use the same filed name of CREDITS e.g. D: for Description.
(maybe you can invert D: description and T: time of last update)
It whould nice also if we include the type of the license (GPL,...).
This for a fast parsing (and maybe also to replace the few lines
of license)
Instead of C: it is more important (IMHO) to include the module name.
Maybe we can include both (modules name are always lower case).
I think that the inclusion of the config option is not important (
considering that it can be easily parsed from the kaos' new makefiles).
