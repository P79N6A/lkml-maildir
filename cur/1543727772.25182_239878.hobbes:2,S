Please no, not this half-baked patch anyway.

Well, one of its users, yes.

Good.

That's not an argument for throwing out support for POSIX/SuS
functionality which 2.4 has supported all along.  But never mind,
embedded may not need it, and your defaults are the right way round.

At the least you need to add a dependency on CONFIG_SYSVIPC.
And you shouldn't disable standard functionality without
saying so in the Kconfig help.
You're completely changing the meaning and configurability of
CONFIG_TMPFS.  Perhaps it's not a useful config option any more
(too often needed "y", too little saved by "n"), and yours is
more useful.  But if you want to go this way, you must change
its name and Documentation and #ifdefs too.
I do agree that mm/shmem.o is larger (did someone at the back say
"bloated"?) than we'd wish, that embedded in particular would like
it smaller, and embedded might have no need to support SysV IPC
and Posix SHM and shared anonymous and tmpfs.
But I prefer Matt's tiny tiny-shmem.c which does support all those,
using ramfs instead, and says in Kconfig what it's doing.
But perhaps you're wanting to avoid ramfs too?
A lot (but less than I once imagined) of the overhead in mm/shmem.o
does come from its support for swap.  I've not been eager to pepper
it with #ifdef CONFIG_SWAPs; but if there's a real demand for that
I could give it a try (while abstracting away the #ifdefs as much
as possible).
