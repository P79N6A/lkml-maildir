Nope, random doesn't. The only thing I converted in my sweep that did
were CAST5 and CAST6, which are fairly unique in doing key-based
rotations. On the other hand:
typedef unsigned int __u32;
static inline __u32 rol32(__u32 word, int shift)
{
        return (word << shift) | (word >> (32 - shift));
}
int foo(int val, int rot)
{
        return rol32(val, rot);
}
With 2.95:
   0:   55                      push   %ebp
   1:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
   3:   8b 4d 0c                mov    0xc(%ebp),%ecx
   6:   8b 45 08                mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
   9:   d3 c0                   rol    %cl,%eax
   b:   c9                      leave
   c:   c3                      ret
With 3.3.5:
   0:   55                      push   %ebp
   1:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
   3:   8b 45 08                mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
   6:   8b 4d 0c                mov    0xc(%ebp),%ecx
   9:   5d                      pop    %ebp
   a:   d3 c0                   rol    %cl,%eax
   c:   c3                      ret
With gcc-snapshot:
   0:   55                      push   %ebp
   1:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
   3:   8b 45 08                mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
   6:   8b 4d 0c                mov    0xc(%ebp),%ecx
   9:   d3 c0                   rol    %cl,%eax
   b:   5d                      pop    %ebp
   c:   c3                      ret
So I think tweaks for x86 at least are unnecessary.
