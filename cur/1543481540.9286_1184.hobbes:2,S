	Hashes have O(1) for insert/hit/miss, but something like in the
avg case and worst case insert of N, worst case select of N lg N. RBtrees,
may or may not be useful for socket demultiplexing in the network, but
they have lgN worst case for all ops.  An insert that violates the
Red/Black props of the tree can be fixed in like 6-12 pointer ops, which
is cheap for most apps.
	For the kind of things you work on where hashes work well, I find
that TSTrees often work better, on avg less ops to find the key. Worth
looking at anyway.
