I think that the best hope is a combination of Roman's module depends
work (based on Kai's "everything which is a module is trivial", and
Stephen and my first depends hack) and explicit depends.
Linkage ordering doesn't work in general, for things like "I want to
be initialized before the non-boot cpus have come up", but for
non-core code it's simple.

Yes, it'll slow the build by a few seconds: but if the linker ever
decides not to preserve ordering, we'll need it.  My original shell
script is suboptimal but we *don't* want the kernel build relying on
libbfd.
Roman and I will come up with something and send it to you later this
week.
Thanks!
Rusty.
