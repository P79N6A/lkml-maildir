You should calm down, in my opinion. All the burden about the PCI dma API
is your fault to you David and you David. :)
It takes a too long time for you 2 Davids to agree about this API.
Personnally, I donnot care about dma64_addr_t versus dma_addr_t being 32,
64 even 69 bits (why not, some machine with 36 bit addressing are still in
use).
Just change the topic, please. The sym2 driver has nothing to do with this
boring thread.
