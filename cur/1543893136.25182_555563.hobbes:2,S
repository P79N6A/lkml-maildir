only poorly designed webservers run as root. in general they have not been 
running as root for many years.
however, if you are willing to take a limited shell (root or any other 
user) that's a different story, what would you want the shell to have 
permission to do? would read files in directory A and write files in 
directory B be good enough? or would you want it to be able to execute 
specific commands?
note that at the moment I am not comitting anyone to provide a box for 
such a challange, but I'm interested in what you would consider a suitable 
test.
