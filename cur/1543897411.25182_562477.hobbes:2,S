What I meant is that with XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP the previously-written data
is ZEROED OUT, unlike with fallocate() which leaves previously-written
data alone and only allocates in holes.
So, if you had a sparse file with some data in it:
     AAAAA         BBBBBB
fallocate() would allocate the holes:
00000AAAAA000000000BBBBBB00000000
XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP would overwrite everything:
000000000000000000000000000000000
In order to specify this for allocation, FA_FL_DEL_DATA would need to make
sense for allocations (as well as the deallocation).  This is farily easy
to do - just mark all of the existing extents as unallocated, and their
data disappears.
Cheers, Andreas
