I have a second thought on this. AMD has architected the performance counters.
Their specification is not part of a model specific documentation but
part of the AMD64 architecure.  If they were to radically change the
way performance counters are defined, then the processor would violate the
architecture. They can certainely extened the architecture, e.g., have more
than 4 counters. Those new counters could be model-specific, in which case
I would create a model-specific PMU description for it. If they want
to extened the capability for all new processors, I think a cleaner
way would be to update the architecture and then we could update the
descsription we have.
What I don't not quite understand with the K7, K8 terminology is the
relation/dependencies with the AMD64 architecture specification.
