I interpreted your "or just removed" in [1] as your approval for a patch 
to remove the non-compiling drivers.
I'm not a native English speaker, and therefore I might have 
misunderstood your email.
What I want for 2.6.16 is to remove the wrong dependency of MTD_SHARP on 
BROKEN and the non-compiling drivers either still hidden under BROKEN or 
removed.
If there is any way I can submit a patch achieving this that would be 
acceptable for you simply tell how exactly you want this patch.

We are talking about drivers marked as BROKEN for one and a half years 
that do no longer compile.
