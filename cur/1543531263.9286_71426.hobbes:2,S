To try to push this discussion from "why" to "how", I've added an entry to
the Free Software Bazaar (
http://visar.csustan.edu/bazaar/bazaar.html
)
offering $100 to the person who makes Linux memory allocation behave as
documented by the relevant standards.
All those who spoke out against overcommitment and the "OOM killer" are
invited to add money to the pool. Hopefully someone familar enough with the
code will decide to take us up on the offer.
