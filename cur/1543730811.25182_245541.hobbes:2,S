Dou you know a nice thing?  We (as in the Linux Community) don't have to
compete with anyone.  Sure, we're usually trying to be better than
anyone else, but unlike companies under maret pressure we can wait until
something is ready.

consensus that we want things working at the VFS (and actually working
of course)
