Not really, no.  My understanding is basically client-only, aside  
from looking at the Open Graphics Project prototype rendering model a  
bit.  As far as I can see from the discussions and models publicly  
available they are targeting a certain OpenGL standard for their  
card, although I can see I must have misunderstood what that really  
means.
So a modern GPU is essentially a proprietary CPU with an obscure  
instruction set and lots of specialized texel hardware?  Given the  
total lack of documentation from either ATI or NVidia about such  
cards I'd guess it's impossible for Linux to provide any kind of  
reasonable 3d engine for that kind of environment, and it might be  
better to target a design like the Open Graphics Project is working  
to provide.
Cheers,
