I don't think that's obviously true. 11.3.2 of the 3.0 spec states:
"A package consisting of references to all active cooling devices that 
should be engaged when the associated active cooling threshold (_ACx) is 
exceeded." 
(referring to _ALx objects).

Given that this presumably didn't occur under Windows, I think it would 
be significantly better to figure out why and then fix that. 
Alternatively, if the firmware tables are actually genuinely broken in a 
way that's impossible to repair, you can replace the table. That has the 
advantage that there's no risk of the platform and the OS becoming 
confused.
