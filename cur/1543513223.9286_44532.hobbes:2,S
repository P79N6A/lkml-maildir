Hi Mark.

One thing I absolutely HATE is the fact that Netscape responds to
"BGColor=DarkBlue" by producing DIFFERENT colours depending on whether
it's being run under Linux or Windows, and IE5 produces different
colours for "BGColor=RoyalBlue" under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT.
Those are just the ones I've found so far (both confirmed by some
non-colourblind friends of mine), and I'm sure there are others, but
it makes it very difficult to devise a colour scheme that works on all
combinations of browser and operating system !!!
 > yellow, lightblue are near-illegible on cyan.
 > red and orange are readable but somewhat irritating on cyan.
Incidentally, the colour scheme I'm looking for is one where the text
can remain either Black or NavyBlue, but the background colour can
vary to indicate different things. Basically, I need four different
background colours that satisfy ALL of the following requirements:
 1. Provides a good contrast to the text colour under all of
    the various colour blindness options.
 2. Does so equally well under all graphical web browsers, and
    especially under both Netscape and Internet Explod^Hrer.
 3. Does so equally well under all combinations of operating
    system for each of those browsers.
Any suggestions relating to this will be very much appreciated.
Also, a friend of mine has asked me how his pages fare with people
suffering from colour blindness, and I am sure he would appreciate
opinions on this matter from other than myself. His homepage is

Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
