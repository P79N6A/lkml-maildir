I don't think so. These same programs work fine on a MLS based system, with
extensive capability controls. They do not need to be privileged. I as
a user edit files that I own. If I as system administrator edit files
that configure the system, then I do so because the system administrator
owns the files. If those files are also marked as security restricted then
I must get permission (either temporary or permanently) from the security
administrator to modify those files. This does not require the editor to be
privileged. If UNICOS is operating in the B1 mode, then I must have the
system in single user mode before I can modify these files. The programs
still do not have to be privileged. Access controls on the target of the
program are sufficient to restrict what I can do. This is in the category
of "been there, done that".
Now in the case of XFree86 - It shouldn't have privileges, but does due
to its' historical implementation. With the advent of frame buffer based
servers, it will loose the setuid capability. As far as MLS goes, it is
necessary to establish the users security profile before the X server may
be operated.
