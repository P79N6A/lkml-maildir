Ok, but it doesn't help, as I guess the scanner0 entry will only appear 
if I use the scanner module, which I don't want to...so no scanner0 
entry in my case.
But I basicaly managed to get support vie libusb (doing a brute chmod 
666 on the proc device). Just need to set the rights correctly to the 
device via a script and let hotplug do the rest. Everything new to me, 
but makes sense somehow...
