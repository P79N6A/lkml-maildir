I noticed (and was told by someone else) that it was APIC related.  I
looked, and realized that IO-APIC got selected between my compiles of
ac4 and ac5.  I recompiled ac5 w/o the IO-APIC stuff, and still got an
oops.  So, i recompiled without ANY APIC stuff, and it booted fine, but
then had the same problems I was having w/ 2.4.1-pre1 related to X and
(maybe) the framebuffer.  But that's a whole different story that I
think has been brought up in another thread.
Guess I'm back to -ac4 for now ;-)
Thanks,
Nathan
