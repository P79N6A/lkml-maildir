I mainly looked for mentions of "firmware" to try and work out which
drivers were exporting this information in a single file. While I've
used the aacraid cards in the past I think I agree with you that no 1 of
those 3 pieces of information represents the firmware. Perhaps it could
export a triplet though?

Management stuff always seems to be tied to a single card. It's one of
the things that puts me off hardware RAID. It would really rock if we
could get as much as possible exported in the same fashion across cards,
rather than having to cope with each individually (though I accept that
accessing all details/features will probably always require some custom
card knowledge).
Do the management folks actually have some ideas about what sort of
interface they'd like in sysfs?
