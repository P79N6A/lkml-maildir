Though I can't test it now - blown up my zip - it's said either
scsi_lowlevel or scsi_hostadapter are called up when sd_mod is going up.
I've got the message archived here somewhere.

This is, IMHO, the best solution. This way, we don't have to worry about
second-hand aliases. Isn't that what the dependency information is there 
for anyway?
On the other hand, scsi presents a special problem because many adapters
can in theory provide service for devices of the same categories. What if
we have two adapters both providing disk services (uncommon, I admit - but
not so in the ppa case) or any same service - what can be done about that?
