Sorry for the incomplete and unprofessional bugreport, I don't have more
info. 
I tried Kernel 2.5.71. Everything seems to work fine until I shut down
or try to 
unmount a mountend nfs filesystem. For several minutes nothing happens, 
then I get something what looks like a backtrace from the nfs related
code 
section. Unfortunately there is nothing in the log files afterwards.
