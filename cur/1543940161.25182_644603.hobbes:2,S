I think it says this:
  "If your system is misbehaving, then try adding the acpi_use_timer_override
   keyword to your kernel command line (/boot/grub/menu.lst) and see if it helps."
So, you can either hardcode it in /boot/grub/menu.lst (just add it to the end
of the first line you see there that begins with the word "kernel".
Or you can just try it temporarily at boot time (safer, but tricker),
by catching GRUB (the bootloader) before it actually loads Linux.
Usually there's some key or something it says you have 3 seconds to hit for a "menu",
so do that, and then use the cursor keys to find the first "kernel" line in that menu
and hit "e" (edit) to go and add the acpi_use_timer_override keyword to the end of
that line (same as above).
Hit enter when done, and then the letter b (boot) to load Linux with that option.
Clear as mud, right?  :)
