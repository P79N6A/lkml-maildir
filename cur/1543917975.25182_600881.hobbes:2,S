(please cc me, as i´m not subscribed to linux-kernel/ide - thanks)
hi,
we have some Fujitsu Siemens Celsius M450 workstations (Intel 975X Express chipset)
running Linux Kernel 2.6.22 (Debian, Ubuntu) on an md raid 1 using two Western Digital
Raptor drives, it´s the WD800ADFS which is an oem version (you will find them in
workstations from HP, IBM, Dell, Fujitsu-Siemens,... and they have different model
numbers) using ahci and ncq we are experiencing low performace, and many
hsm violations, sometimes also timeouts, so i think this drive should be added
to the libata ncq blacklist, as the WD740ADFD is already blacklisted and the
Raptor series generally seems to have some ncq issues...
kind regards,
simon.
