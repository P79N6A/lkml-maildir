Yes, this would be a very useful thing.
I'm not a perfect canidate due to my time restrictions but am willing if
people want me to.  Lets hear a few more volunteers (Johannes? Randy?,
anyone else?).  Here are my modest qualifications.
pros:
+ know the USB code reasonably well.  (uhci being the exception)
+ I play well with others.
+ I'll keep the latest sources in a CVS repository & setup anonymous
  access for developers to sync up with.
cons:
- I am busy with a startup so my turnaround time may be slow,
  especially during the week.
- I don't want to do patch merging for people; if two good patches
  conflict, one or none of them will be applied & the submitters
  informed.
IMHO, more than one maintainer would be nice.  How do people feel about
using a system such as 
http://www.sourceforge.net/
 (free, sponsored by
valinux) for CVS sound?  [Allowing a few of us commit access and having
the rest of people coordinate patches through us via the mailing list?]
(if that sounds like bsd style development, well, it is and it works) One
of us could be designated as the "alpha maintainer" to keep the kernel up
to date with our tree by feeding patches to linus.  No flamewars please.
