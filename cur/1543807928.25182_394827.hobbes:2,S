We still have this one in init/main.c:
        /* Sets up cpus_possible() */
        smp_prepare_cpus(max_cpus);
That is actually why s390 is doing this in smp_prepare_cpus. We also use the
passed value of max_cpus to set the number of bits in cpu_possible_map
accordingly. This isn't possible anymore if this should be done in setup_arch.
So it looks like we have to switch to setup_arch and set NR_CPUS bits in
cpu_possible_map on s390.
