Luiz, you can't be serious! You have to do a review and write call paths
on a piece of paper or however you prefer to do it. Your testing is
extremely limited as we know, you don't even have a null-modem cable.
So if the patch does not trip in your testing it tells you absolutely
nothing. But even in context of AKPM's tree you can't rely on run-time
checks to pick this sort of things.
And putting a BUG in there is irresponsible too. It's such a critical
subsystem. Drop bytes or return zero modem lines, but do not bug out.
