Please supply the following information:
- does 2.6.0-test3 detect the card at boot ?
  - if not, what are the complete kernel messages ?
- does 2.6.0-test3 detect it at every insertion after the first
  "insert remove insert" cycle, or does it always need an even
  number of insertions for it to be recognised?
- does 2.4 and 2.6-test3 yenta find the same IRQs ?
- which version of pcmcia-cs are you using with 2.4 ?
- which IRQ(s) does 2.4 i82365 use ?
