Ok, will fix it, sorry.

yes, preemption is explicitly disabled in start_secondary() that
calls this function.

Well, I'm not sure. I think the global variable cpu_khz is wrong
in the first place. This should be per-cpu, because each CPU can
have a different frequency, right?
And cpu_khz is adjusted in time_cpufreq_notifier() when whichever
CPU's frequency changes.  To me it seems that it's a leftover from
the times when all CPUs in a system ran at the same speed. I
think it should be killed. I just did not want to make too many
unrelated changes in one patchset.
It doesn't matter that much in this case that it probably is
wrong (as the comment explains)...
