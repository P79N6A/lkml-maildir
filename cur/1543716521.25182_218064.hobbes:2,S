Since I see Andrew dropped the patch for the moment, I'm thinking that
the ball is back in you guys court.  If you end up with some patch to a
well-known base (Linus rc or Andrew mm, say) that you'd like me to try
out, let me know.  You might want to include the printk's of
args/results that you describe above, right in the patch, so I can
provide more rapid and useful feedback, should whatever be this
execve/sharedlib problem still persist.
Yes - I have the hardware - but I must ration my time on this patch.
Will this work for you?
