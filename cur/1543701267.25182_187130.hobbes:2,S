Hi,
Here are some i2c driver fixes and updates for 2.6.0.  There are a
number of bug fixes here, a big documentation update, and a new i2c chip
driver was added.
Please pull from:  bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/i2c-devel-2.6
Individual patches will follow, sent to the sensors and linux-kernel
lists.
thanks,
greg k-h
