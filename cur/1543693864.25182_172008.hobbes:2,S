it's not so simple. Firstly, it would burden some of the other timer
codepaths with extra logic. (mod/add/del_timer) Secondly, the use of
timer->base is closely controlled, and it's not that simple to clear the
value of '1' from timer->base after the timer has run. [this could race
with any other CPU.]
it would be much cleaner to add another timer->running field, especially
since this would be the 8th word-sized field in struct timer_list, making
it a nice round structure size.
btw., there's a third type of timer race we have. If a timer function is
delayed by more than 1 timer tick [which could happen under eg. UML], then
it's possible for the timer function to run on another CPU in parallel to
the already executing timer function.
