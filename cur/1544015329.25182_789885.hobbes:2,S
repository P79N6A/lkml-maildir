How about something like this?  It's deliberately vague about the exact
userspace requirements (basically saying you have to do your homework first)
but is otherwise pretty clear I think.
This patch adds more documentation for the DRM_I915_KMS option, warning
users to be sure any existing software they want to use with the i915 driver
is capable of using the new interfaces provided.

-	Choose this option if you want kernel modesetting enabled by default,
-	and you have a new enough userspace to support this. Running old
-	userspaces with this enabled will cause pain.  Note that this causes
-	the driver to bind to PCI devices, which precludes loading things
-	like intelfb.
+	Choose this option if you want kernel based mode setting enabled by
+	default (normally you have to pass "modeset=1" as a module parameter
+	to enable this feature).  When kernel mode setting is enabled, the
+	driver will support the mode setting ioctls defined in drm_mode.h
+	(which should be used through libdrm's xf86drmMode.h interface).
 
+	Note that when this option is enabled, it will conflict with other
+	drivers of this hardware such as intelfb or a non-kernel mode setting
+	enabled xf86-video-intel (which include all versions prior to 2.6),
+	and so could lead to bad behavior like memory corruption, non-functional
+	video output, and machine hangs.  So if you plan to use this feature
+	be sure your installed userspace software is compatible.
