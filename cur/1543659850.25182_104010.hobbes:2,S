Yup, Andrew Theurer from our performance team has been working on this.
Initial results look encouraging.

Absolutely. Hopefully by the time you return we'll have a structure for
hyperthreading in place that's reasonably tuned ;-)
There's some more tuning and tweaking we could do to the NUMA machines as

the infrastructure is correct.
Thanks,
