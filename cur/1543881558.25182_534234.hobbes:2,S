I've been investigating the situation a little bit more, and here's
what's going on:
 - SuS allows for O_NONBLOCK on regular files as per
   
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/write.html
 - actually implementing O_NONBLOCK semantics for regular fixes
   breaks userspace when poll/select claims files are ready to
   read/write but they aren't, see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/17/17
So we can't really expose O_NONBLOCK on regular files to userspace,
and we need to make sure in common code this does not happen.
EJUKEBOX on snaphots does make sense, though.  Can you please send
a full patchseries for nfsd, the common code and the xfs writepath
so that this actually gets used and behaviour is consistant for all
(or at least most) filesystems?
Also now that the patch goes to mainline please kill ugly FILP_DELAY_FLAG
and just check the flags directly.  And it should probably only check
O_NONBLOCK.  The only architecture having O_NDELAY different from
O_NONBLOCK is sparc, and it already translates the value for us.
