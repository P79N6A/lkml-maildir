Now the i875 chipset should have reasonable memory access speed, but 192
GB/s looks a tiny bit suspect :-)

"You want to save them all, ATerafin?" She laughed, and the laugh
was chilling. "Try, try with my blessings." There was no question
whatever to Margret that the words were a curse, meant to cause
pain; they implied certain failure, and the amusement of the
powerful at the pathetic struggles of those doomed to fail.
