Not for anon pages, and how do you know whether it's anon or not before
looking at the page, which may be free by the time you look at it?
In other words, mm->page_table_lock is the one, because it's required
for unmapping a pte, and any mapped page will be forced to hold a count
increment until it gets past that lock.  Without this lock, the results
of pte_page are unstable.
