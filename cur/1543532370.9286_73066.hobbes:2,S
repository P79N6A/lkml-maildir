Correct so far (but no, incorrect, there is nothing to add).

Oh, yes it can. I'm sorry, but the "data area" is a red herring, if by
that you mean memory obtained by malloc.  That's purely up to you the
programmer to get and deal with. (I'm aware that gcc sometimes implants
calls, but that's again up to you to to deal with at the compiling
stage). Do it. Be prepared for a zero return from malloc.

Well, you'd better not attempt to run it as a secure system then! Horst
- calm down, and THINK about it. If you are running every job on your
system as a secure job that requires 8MB of backing store before it
will start up, then you had better cough up for a disk with 
the 2GB of swap required or I, at least, will laugh and refer you to
TFM.
Otherwise your system will not start. So Don't Do That Then. Start the
jobs on your system that need guarantees against being killed as secure
jobs, with 8MB of backing store guaranteed for each of them. Let the
rest run as you like.  If you run out of backing store, using the
simple accounting rule of 8MB per secure process, then you can't start
any more _secure_ processes. Simple as that. That's all. Nothing stops
you running ls, or df. And nothing stops you waiting until you have 8MB
of backing store available again so that you can start another secure
job.

No, it will not go out of memory.

These are not secure jobs, and even so, why should I forget about it
even if I were so daft as to run them as secure jobs? I could give you
2GB of swap of my system right now and not even notice.

No it does not. See above.
