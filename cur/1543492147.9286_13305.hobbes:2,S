Oh my, oh my...
To get this stupid discussion over with, I can volunteer to repackage the
new releases of all tools that right now are listed in the kernel as
RPM's or whatever, to .tar.gz's, if the authors of those programs doesn't
feel able/lack the time/whatever to do that themselves.
Then I'll make the packages available on a server here at the Uni, and
have that be the place where the kernel points at.
I promise not to tamper with the integrity of the binaries/sources in any
way.
Period to the debate? Can everyone be happy with this?!
