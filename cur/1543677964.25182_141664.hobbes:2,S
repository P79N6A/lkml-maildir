I'm running a Toshiba Libretto L2 (Crusoe, ACPI, ALI).  I don't have 
any troubles with 2.5.63 (which happens to be my current stable 
kernel).  However, I've been playing with 2.4.21 with just the swsusp 
patches (not -ac) and with most builds I've tried there, invoking 
hwclock always hangs the machine (which I assume is rtc related).
Let me know if I can provide any more information...
