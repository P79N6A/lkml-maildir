                              ||_____ Found MAP file.

    This shows that file contents in the map file were not accessible
    via int 0x13 during boot time. This is usually caused by overwriting
    the previous kernel without running lilo after.
    It can also be caused by the file-system that contains linux, being
    something like 'hda1' when Linux runs, but it is really 'hda2' when
    through the BIOS (0x81 instead of 0x80).

Penguin : Linux version 2.3.13 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
