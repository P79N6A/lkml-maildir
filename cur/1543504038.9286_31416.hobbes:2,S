I agree, for every POSIX extension to come a CLONE flag is required, so
apart from the CLONE_SIGNALS flag, there is coming an CLONE_SEM,
CLONE_SHM and CLONE_MQ.

I agree, the internal kernel definition should match the POSIX definition.

OK, it should be equal to INT_MAX.
BTW it looks like the kernel is lacking a sysconf system call. Or would
everybody prefer it to be in the C library?
One of the reasons for being in the kernel would be that certain kernel
compile time constants are only known in the kernel and not in the
C-library. For instance the number of TIMERS could be changed in the
kernel, while the C-library is unaware.
