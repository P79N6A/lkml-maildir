The basic idea is to provide a base frequency adjustment, when I wrote this I 
already wasn't entirely happy that it was hardcoded like this, but in the end 
I simply reimplemented what the old code did.
It's not strictly needed, so if someone wants to add something like:
#ifndef CLOCK_TICK_RATE
#define CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST 0
#else
...
it would be fine with me.
bye, Roman
