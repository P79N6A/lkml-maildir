Subject: Re: [PATCH 2.6.23.14] SCSI : scsi_device_lookup/scsi_device_lookup_by_target return NULL for an existent scsi_device

This sounds like a return to the old behavior, where sdevs in SDEV_DEL
were ignored. However, it too had lots of bad effects. We'd have to go
back to the threads over the last 2 years that justified resurrecting
the sdev. Start looking at threads like :
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=115555788730468&w=2
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=116837744314913&w=2
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=117139230702785&w=2
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=117991046126294&w=2
Also, there's multiple parts to this - the sdev struct, and the sysfs objects
and thus namespace associated with the struct, etc.
So, in my mind, if this reverts to ignoring sdevs in SDEV_DEL, and creates
a duplicate sdev in SDEV_RUNNING, then it's the wrong patch.  What should
be considered is where did the resurrection of the sdev go wrong.  I
remember that Hannes did some updates
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=118215727101887&w=2
but I don't believe these ever got merged upstream. Perhaps that's a good
place to start.
