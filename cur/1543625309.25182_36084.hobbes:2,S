That's a very nice short-term option, but I suspect that after
some years the people in Silicon Valley will get smarter than
that ;)
I agree with Alan, the future is moving computer programming
to places where programmers don't need to earn a small fortune,
places where programmers can be economic to the company working
"just" 40 hours a week instead of the 60 to 90 hours I've seen
some people in the US suffer ...
... maybe even places where the cost of living is low enough
that programmers can have time to think and have a life,
instead of being forced to work more than what's good for
them just because of the local price level.
regards,
Rik
