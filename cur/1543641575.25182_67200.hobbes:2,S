I'm basically looking for VSZ, RSS, %cpu, & pid -- after that I don't
care. top(1) examines a lot more than it feeds into the display, for
reasons unknown. In principle, there are ways of recovering the other
bits that seem too complex to be worthy of doing:
(1) update a mm->shared counter on every PG_direct break/collapse
(2) walk the pte_chain updating mm->dirty for each pte every time
	set_page_dirty() or ClearPageDirty() is done
(3) binfmt helpers + arch specific helpers for the binfmt helpers for
	keeping count of up mm->lib
(1) doesn't sound good because pte_chain stuff is already a big hotspot
(2) doesn't sound good for the same reason
(3) sounds like a portability nightmare
i.e. Not worth doing. esp. for stats of which only (1) is used/usable,
and the value of (1) in question (IMHO) due to the longstanding
misreporting.

If top(1) understood/used /proc/$PID/maps that'd be fine. It's more or
less a "vaguely compatible placeholder" aside from RSS, and there's
some kind of burden of vague compatibility for /proc/ stuff.
Per-vma RSS is trivial, just less self-contained. Everywhere the
mm->rss is touched, the vma to account that to is also known, except
for put_dirty_page(), and that can be repaired as its caller knows.
Cheers,
