well the api is already split between blocking and non-blocking so in
principle that's easy. The problem is that I suspect most users will use
the non-blocking variant.
Also the "what to do" can be treacherous; it'll need a callback list
simply because many places can be using the latency values, more than
just idle. (I can see pstate code for example also using it to limit
which ones to use, and not use the ones it takes to long to get out of)
I'll investigate what it'll take to get the callback in place; for the
C-state case it's not THAT critical (after all the cpu you are running
on when making this call is not in a deep C state.. :-)
