There is a patch for an NFSv3 client that works on
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src
The modified 'mount' command (and patches) are to be found under 
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv3-mount
Please note that I'm in the process of thinking of a redesign of the
code for handling asynchronous write requests (and probably too the
code for handling large rsize), since I gather Linus isn't too happy
with it. Anybody who would like to contribute ideas/code etc are quite 
welcome to do so...
Cheers,
  Trond
