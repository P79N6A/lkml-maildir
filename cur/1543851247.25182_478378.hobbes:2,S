I'm 100% certain the driver doesn't touch the memory page. It would be a
serious problem if it did as I'd see see memory corruption in the cases
where the page wasn't read from disk but read from the swap cache (I
don't).
The error therefore has to be coming from a pagefault attempt on the
address...

I'll see if I can work it out...

Right, this is a nicer way to do it. I would have preferred to do
something like this in the first place but didn't as I didn't think I
could use PageError as a marker...
I'll try and work out why PageError is causing the problems and also
give the patch some testing.
Thanks,
Richard
