So do I. Moreover, -pre should start with several network-related fixes,
so your fix might find a comfortable place there :-)
I will release another -hf with recent fixes. I noticed I missed three of
them from 2.4.32-rc2 (I thought I was up to date but they showed up just
before the announcement). They are the memleak in sd_mod, the TCP snd_wnd
fix and the fix for the infinite loop in udp_v6_get_port(). So I can also
merge your fix early if you want (I already queued it for later inclusion).
I generally try to avoid including fixes that are not much transversal,
but I read in your patch that the bug you fixed could cause side effects
to any parts in the kernel, so if you feel it's appropriate for -hf, I'll
trust you :-)
Cheers,
Willy
