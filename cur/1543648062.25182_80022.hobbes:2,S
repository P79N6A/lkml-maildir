I am in no way inplying that you are making any guarantees about your patches to
work with something but the kernels they are released for.
On the other hand I thought you might find it useful if I report to you
problems with more modern kernels that I encounter so that when you will
update UML to never kernel you do not need to hit all the problems by yourself.

Yes, it seems to be the case.
CFLAGS is defined first in arch/um/Makefile and only then you do
include Makefile-{SUBARCH}
Moving 'include $(ARCH_DIR)/Makefile-$(SUBARCH)' in front of CFLAGS
helped.
