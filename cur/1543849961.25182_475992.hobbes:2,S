It isn't the culprit -- I've looked at it some more and noticed it works 
perfectly on another box with the same kernel (but it works as well on the 
broken box with an older kernel).
Looks like the USB port is acting up (only with the new kernel -- so this is 
probably triggered by a USB driver or possibly APIC change [will try with 
pci=noapic next])
The box where it breaks is an Asus Pundit R-350 barebone with an ATI USB 
controller:
00.13.0 0c03: 1002:4347 (rev 01) (prog-if 10)
	Subsystem: 1043:8108
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 17
	Memory at fe800000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
The working box has a VIA USB 2.0 controller
00:10.3 0c03: 1106:3104 (rev 82) (prog-if 20)
        Subsystem: 1025:0046
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 18
        Memory at d0002800 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
        Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 2
