I don't know about performance (except for quality: it's said to require 
about half the bitrate for the same quality, compared to mp3) however, it
has one killer advantage over mp3: it's patent-free, and hence, royalty-free. 
I'd think that would be important for your project.

But that would be an argument against supporting mp3 as well.

On a quick reading, this appears to indicate you can easily have what you 
want:
   
http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/doc/framing.html
Perhaps the last time you looked at Ogg the streaming format had not yet been 
completed?
Also, doesn't part of telephony consist of having lots of pre-recorded audio 
around, for voice mail etc?  Granted, an encoder optimized for music is not 
necessarily optimzed for voice.  However, would that not be a matter of 
tweaking the encoder?  As I understand it, the vorbis compression format is 
quite general, and in fact, all the recent work that improved the quality so 
noticably involved only the encoder.
OK, this isn't a really kernel issue, so... I'll clamp my hams and post it 
anyway ;-)
