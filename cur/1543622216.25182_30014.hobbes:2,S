It could be one of the patches that comes before irqrate-A1 in the 00-90
numbering sequence that your patches use; I've definitely reproduced this
without any of the patches numbered higher than the irqrate-A1 patch.(In
my case, if I applied all of those patches except the irqrate one, I
didn't get the freeze. If I applied all the patches up to the irqrate one
after, then I got the freeze.)
