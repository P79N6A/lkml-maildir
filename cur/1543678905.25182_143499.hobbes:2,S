Hi List
I am doing a kernel with make-kpkg -rev ywesee.1 kernel_image
And then install it with dpkg -i kernel-image.... .deb
My maschine now boots great on the new 2.4.21 execpt that I do not have any network connection anymore.
I loaded the drivers for my onboard Intel Network eepro100 (plus the other two options below).
With the Debian Kernel bf24-2.4.20 my network connection is great...
Any hints anyone?
Thanks in advance.
Zeno
PS: Linux is great!
