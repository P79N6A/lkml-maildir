I guess you mean 256 billion page structs.
So what do you mean by efficient? I guess you aren't talking about CPU
efficiency, because even if you make the IO subsystem submit larger
physical IOs, you still have to deal with 256 billion TLB entries, the
pagecache has to deal with 256 billion struct pages, so does the
filesystem code to build the bios.
So you are having problems with your IO controller's handling of sg
lists?
