ok, to make sure i understand this right: it is not safe to switch any 
local APIC in the system into clustered APIC mode on the E850x chipset 
/at all/, because if one of the CPUs gets an INIT/startup IPI message 
its local APIC will default to logical flat mode and might confuse the 
chipset?
on large systems that have their APIC IDs set up to group CPUs amongst 
different clusters and hence triggered cluster mode, the chipset does 
not get confused by this, correct?
