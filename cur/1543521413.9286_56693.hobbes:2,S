I spent several years working on embedded systems for Sonix and 3com. Been 
there, done that. Putting stuff in kernel space that can be elsewhere is
normally a bad idea - NFSroot is another example. 
If you put tftproot in the kernel then dhcpd, netware root, smb root, ipx
based RPL, 802.2LLC based RPL and all the rest will follow. If people fix
any rough edges on the initrd handling all of these, and combinations will
come out ok in user space
Second thing; tftp is almost away done wrongly for an embedded system. Unless
you are protecting your data stream with a shared secret between your boot
loader and your main system it requires you only deploy such devices on a 
trusted lan segment firewalled from the main network as tftp has no credible
security - its meant to be a trivial protocol.

So use the non m-sys driver.

Andre pushed the key patches for sandisk related flash (its not weird by the
way its a standard with a real specification and the like and multivendor)

On an embedded box that is one I'd userspace simply to get it very small when
possible. And 2.3.3x has the i2c bus changes needed to support lm-sensors and
the newer tv cards switched over to the newer i2c bus drivers, so thats
rubbish on your part too.

And the point is ?

Actually its clean, the kludge is putting chunks of user crud into kernel
space.
