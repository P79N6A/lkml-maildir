REVIEW BY: tesseract Reviewed  Jun 26, 2007
Due to a bug in the hardware of this card it doesn't work with Linux. The 
card does works at 100mb/s speed but when put to gigabit speeds it gets TX 
Unit Hang messages. Further information can be found at 
http://e1000.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Issues
 . The drivers haven't 
be able to work around the issue yet, its been over a year. Just as a side 
note, I don't know the quality of card in windows as I don't run windows.

Has this issue been resolved / will this board now work in 2.6.23, is 
anyone on this list running these boards successfully?
Justin.
