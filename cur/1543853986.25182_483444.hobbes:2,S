That is almost always due to the difference in r/wsize that the Linux
NFS server advertises for v2 and v3 combined with using UDP. If you have
poor networking, then don't use UDP, and certainly not with 32k r/wsize.
IOW: try either setting the mount options "rsize=8192,wsize=8192", or
the option "proto=tcp"
