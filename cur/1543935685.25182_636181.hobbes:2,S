It doesn't.  See Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt

The worst that can happen is that a sysadmin doesn't read the docs
(likely) before enabling fuse on a multiuser system, and is surprised
by a user doing funny things.  And _then_ has to go read the docs, or
google for some info.  This is basically how things normally work, and
I don't consider it a DoS.

I'm worried too, and I'm not saying that enabling unprivileged fuse
mounts is completely risk free.  Nothing is, and nobody is forced to
do it.
