I have no idea what "seh" is in wine-speak, but it appears that your 
problem is something totally different, especially as none of the eflags- 
changes seem to matter for you. Also, in your "seh" exception register 
dump, you don't actually seem to have TF set in %eflags (TF is 0x0100).
Some wine person would need to inform us about what the seh exception 
thing means.. "code c0000005"?
