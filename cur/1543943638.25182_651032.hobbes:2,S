Thanks for providing the info. According to the IDs your and my board are 
quite alike. If you don't pass acpi_use_timer_override to vanilla kernel, 
does your timer get connected to IO-APIC? Ie:
           CPU0
  0:      47834   IO-APIC-edge      timer
In this mode, is your board stable? I never run my hw longer than 10h, so I 
cannot say anything about long-term stability, but lately my nforce2 didn't 
make any troubles and (when it did, it usally was related to PSU). I am 
skipping the override, ie. my timer is connected to IO-APIC.
If in the latter mode your hw is instable, we have a problem...
