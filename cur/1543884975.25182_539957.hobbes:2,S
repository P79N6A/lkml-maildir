Hi all
I hope this is the right place to ask this question, if not please redirect me
to the right ML.
I would like to know more about kernel parameters and in particular about the
root parameter.
I'm booting the kernel from usb pen and the root could change while the pen is
plugged in different machines with different hardware.
I was trying to find info about "how to make this unique". 
Does the kernel see only /dev/* ? There's no way to pass /dev/disk/*?
Any help/links is apprecciated
S.
