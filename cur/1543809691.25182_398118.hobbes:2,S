Because it's already a fixed ABI that is put in stone.
The only way to do what you want would be to add a new field
and keep the old one alone, but frankly your rationale for 
it ("could be confusing to someone") doesn't seem convincing enough 
for such a thing.  Especially since each sysfs field can
cost considerable memory when a dentry and a inode have to be allocated
for it.
I guess if you worry about such people a better way to help
them would be to write them a frontend that displays
the information in there in nice form.
