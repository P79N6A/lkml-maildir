I would have to agree here.  If an application is being compiled
specifically and only for a Linux system, forever and always only Linux,
and needs to use Linux kernel headers, the logical place would be
include/linux. Enough applications, and not-in-kernel drivers, use
<linux/*.h>, and they should be able to use *real* kernel headers, since
they are going to be run against a *real* kernel.  But that's a
GNU/glibc issue--they are, in my understanding, supposed to be
OS-neutral.  Glibc, or other programming libraries, shouldn't make
{linux|*bsd|etc}; rather, that should be up to the distribution/OS.  In
the case of RH, they simply make a link from /usr/include to kernel
headers.  This means that when I compile a driver, say, like lm_sensors,
it's compiled against the real kernel, and not against what somebody
I've never met decided I should compile it against.
Which, of course, can be fixed with a simple "rm -rf /usr/include/linux;
ln -sf /usr/src/linux/include/linux linux", which will work in Debian or
any other Linux dist.

That might not actually be a bad idea.  You'd have to change a bunch of
<net/*.h>'s to <linux/net/*.h>, but I bet awk could handle that.  Some
apps need kernel headers (for whatever reason--good or bad), and it
seems logical to have all the include files in one tree.  At least, on a
platform-by-platform basis...  A benefit would be a solid definition of
just exactly which header was being included.
Just my meandering thoughts,
