Hi all,
I'm writing a joystick driver for blackfin linux. when my kernel
startup, I got the following messages:
root:~>dmesg
............
input: ad7142 joystick as /class/input/input0
input: ad7142 joystick at js0
i2c /dev entries driver
ad7142_js_attach: at 0x58
............
If I understood correct, the i2c bus initializtion is implemented
after the input module initializtion. That's a roadblock for me.
Because my joystick is connected to my target board through the I2C
interface. And I should call some I2C routines to initialize my
joystick chip in the input driver. Of course my driver failed.
I know there are many ways to work around this issue. But if I'm
right, I still think it should be fixed in the kernel initialization
sequence.
Thanks for your suggestions.
Regards,
-Aubrey
