Seems silly to unlock the page, when add_to_page_cache() will set it
locked the instant after again.

Yeah that's silly, I'll add a check for sd->len == PAGE_CACHE_SIZE!

Indeed, that was fixed and pushed to the splice repo yesterday actually
along with a fix for a missing lock in the pipe variant.

PIPE_BUF_FLAG_STOLEN used to be used in the release function as well,
hence the flag. It could be removed now, yes. I'll make sure to clear
the flag as well on add_to_page_cache() failure.

I guess I might as well use the right syscallX, but so far things have
worked fine for me on ia64/x86/x86_64. I'll update it.
