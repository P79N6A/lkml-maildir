Subject: 2.6.8 + token buffer filter queue discipline causes kernel panic

Hello,
I have 2.6.8 running on my firewall which uses basic NAT masquerading 
iptables rules.  I recently added a token buffer filter to limit my 
outgoing bandwidth.  As soon as I add the tbf with the tc utility it 
causes a kernel panic.  I backed down to the 2.6.7 kernel(latest debian 
compiled) and the kernel panic does not occur.  Is this a known issue 
with 2.6.8 or should I run the oops through ksymoops and further debug 
the issue.  Thanks.
