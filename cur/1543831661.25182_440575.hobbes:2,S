The more common use case is a department hires a grad student to run the
department server rather than somebody who knows what they're doing (but
costs more than a grad student stipend), and said grad student first sets
up a borked backup scheme that looks like it works, but doesn't actually
produce restorable backups, and then runs mkfs on /home, nuking all the
thesis work of all the students....
(And yes, I've seen that more than once in a quarter century of working
at .edu's... ;)
