you can't do it this way, the number of kmap available can be just 1,
and you can ask for 10000 in a row this way. Furthmore you want to be
able to use all the kmaps available, think if you have 11 kmaps, and 10
are constantly in use. I much prefer my approch that is the most
finegrined and scalable and it doesn't risk to deadlock in function of
the number of kmaps in the pool and the max reservation you make. I just
considered the approch implemented in the patch you quoted and I
discarded it for the reasons explained above.
