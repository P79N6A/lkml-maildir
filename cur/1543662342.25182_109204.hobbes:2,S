Correction: this patch is now working for me.  While pruning my .config
to debug my serial console problem, kexec worked on a 2-way for me
several times in a row without failure.  (I hadn't properly updated my
script that invokes kexec with my preferred command line arguments).
I'll add the patchlet to our PLM system, and try the entire package
again on 2.5.60 on a 2-way.
