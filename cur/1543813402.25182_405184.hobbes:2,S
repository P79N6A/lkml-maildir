Hi all,
I'm writing an audio driver and the hardware requires floating point 
arithmetic.  When I build the kernel I get the following errors at link 
time:
*** Warning: "__subdf3" [sound/sh/siu_sh7343.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "__muldf3" [sound/sh/siu_sh7343.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "__divdf3" [sound/sh/siu_sh7343.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "__adddf3" [sound/sh/siu_sh7343.ko] undefined!
These symbols are coming from gcc. What I would like to do is link the 
kernel with libgcc to solve this errors. I'm looking at the kernel 
makefiles and it doesn't seem obvious to me how to do it. Does anyone 
know how I can link the kernel with libgcc, or point me in the right 
direction ?
By the way this is for the Renesas SH7343 processor.
Thanks,
Carlos Munoz
