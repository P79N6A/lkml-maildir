You can do it with Rock Ridge extensions, a superset of ISO9660 made for
Unix filesystems. Grab cdrecord-1.6+ from ftp.fokus.de (can't remember the
URL) or X-CDWrite (Tcl/Tk front-end for cdrecord) and you be making
wonderful Linux compatible CDs in no time. You can (if you need it) add
Joliet also.
Regards.
