Hi Alex, hi all,
I have an Acer TM3012 with
0a:09.2 Mass storage controller: Texas Instruments 5-in-1 Multimedia Card Reader (SD/MMC/MS/MS PRO/xD)
but only when I plug in an SD card I get a device created, while
plugging in a Memory Stick I do not get any reaction of the kernel.
This is with kernel 2.6.22-rc6.
Is this feature missing or could it be a configuration error (.config if
you need it).
Inserting a sd card gives:
tifm_core: MMC/SD card detected in socket 0:1
mmcblk0: mmc0:bffc SD02G 1985024KiB 
 mmcblk0: p1
From the "MMC/SD card detected" I assumed that MS should work, too.
Thanks for any clarification.
Best wishes
Norbert
