I get something similar without module support just doing a "make bzImage"
of 2.4.10-ac3.
This is on the laptop that I'm just now setting up so I don't have gpm on
it yet, but let me see what I can get, compiling...
Looks like zconf.h included from zlib_fs.h can't be found.  zconf.h
defines voidpf so all hell breaks loose when zconf.h desides to use it.
At least that is what I'm seeing here.
