Geoworks patents go further than that. (Disregarding other third party patents
on using mobile phone data links for car navigation, auction data that you
may hit). 
See 
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000119/ca_geowork_1.html
 for the background
Also 
http://www.geoworks.com/tl/wap_ipr/index.html
 for the requirements if
you are US based. Thats $20K/year if you have >$1M revenue and they can
change the rules at 12 months notice.
