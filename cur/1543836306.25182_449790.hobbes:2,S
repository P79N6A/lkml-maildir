Unfortunately the mechanisms I'm aware of require either error-prone
kernel command line parameters, or (not error prone, but inelegant)
board-specific logic in the drivers, before driver registration, to
do equivalent stuff.

Glad to hear that fixes are in the works.  That's the same conclusion
I reached:  that I2C needed those non-trivial changes.
It may help to see how the SPI core solves that problem.  Unlike I2C,
SPI actually _can't_ probe (except in rare specialized cases), and when
I did the SPI stuff I was thinking about models that could apply easily
to help I2C avoid probing.  (Though not, at this point, code.)
That model of a table of board-specific declarations (with things like
"I2C chip type X at address A, using interrupt I and platform_data P")
should work for I2C too.
