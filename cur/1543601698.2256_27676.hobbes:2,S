NO!
If it is a read-only mapping, we must NOT mark it writable.
The fact is, the page may have been written to earlier, marked read-only
with mprotect(), and the page is dirty but read-only, and swapping it in
MUST NOT markt it writable even if it is our last exclusive copy.
Which we've gotten wrong for a long time, actually. But you #if 0'ed the
fix that happened fairly recently.
