Windows, here, both 95 and NT just do a chkdsk upon startup. Windows
doesn't have the notion of "mount". Maybe Win-2000 will have, but
nothing I've seen yet does.
---and, if the file-system can't be repaired, you just lose everything
and re-install windows, sometimes even if it was repaired. It depends
upon the "service-pack" number and the alignment of planets.
