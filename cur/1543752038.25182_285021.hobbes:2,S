Please consider replacing with the following patch:
Description: Use msleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee the task
delays as expected. TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE is used currently, however signals /
early returns from schedule_timeout() are not checked for. Thus msleep() is more
appropriate.
