Gentlemen, I am heading out to get an "L" (for loser) tattooed to my
forehead.  MSFT pushed some updates for the Windows Server previously, and
when we switched to 2.6.27.8 we rebooted everything, including the Windows
Server, which activated the updates.  MSFT broke volume size reporting --
even from other Windows machines!  We should have checked this before
posting.
Please accept my deepest apologies for this -- Linux is, as always, working
great.
