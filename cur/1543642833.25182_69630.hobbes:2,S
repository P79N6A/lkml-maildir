This is implemented in the md multipath patch in 2.4; it distinguishes between
"active" and "spare" paths.
The LVM1 patch also does this by having priorities for each path and only
going to the next priority group if all paths in the current one have failed,
which IMHO is slightly over the top but there is always someone who might need
it ;-)
This functionality is a generic requirement IMHO.
Sincerely,
