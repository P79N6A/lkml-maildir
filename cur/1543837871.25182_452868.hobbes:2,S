Yes, you are right. As long as ->update_status() method serializes
access to the underlying hardware by itself we don't need locking in
backlight core. If we have several writes one of them will win but we
will never have kernel and hardware disagree about the state they are
in. So we can just remove references to baccklight's semaphore from
drivers.

No, it was not the intent of the patch. I was just trying to remove
unneeded code and simplify error handling because driver core can  do
that for us. The race window is still present and mutex is still
needed.

I am not sure I follow... It would end up in the driver, like
FB_EVENT_BLANK ultimately does. RIght now FB_EVENT_SUSPEND and
FB_EVENT_RESUME are dropped by the blacklight core.
But it does not matter now - if we do not fiddle with backlight's
locks we can continue switching backlight off in drivers.
