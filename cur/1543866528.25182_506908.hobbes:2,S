There are two things 1) setup the LFSR to control how often the Hardware
puts samples into the trace buffer.  2) setup the kernel timer to read
the trace buffer (your d, d is a function of the cpu freq) and process
the samples.  
(c is nonsense)
The kernel timer was set with the goal the the hardware trace buffer
would not get more then half full to ensure we would not lose samples
even for the maximum rate that the hardware would be adding samples to
the trace buffer (user specified N=100,000).

The above statement makes no sense to me.  
Determining the initial LFSR value that is N values from the last value
in the sequence is not easy to do.

The LFSR value is computed ONCE when you start OProfile.  The value is
setup in the hardware once when OProfile starts.  The hardware will
always restart with the value given to it after it reaches the last
value in the sequence.  What you call the "time between unloads" is the
time at which you schedule the kernel routine to empty the trace buffer.
It is calculated once.  It would only need to be recomputed if the cpu
frequency changed.

I was being a bit simplistic in my explination.  I am well aware of the
file system.  The point is the USER specifies the rate (every N events)
that they want to have sampling done.  We are using the existing
mechanism to pass the value of N to the kernel.  So from that
standpoint, we are trying to be consistent in how it is done with the
PPU. I feel that this is best to try to handle the N value in the same
way rather then having a completely different way.  
If we were to put the LFSR into the user space, you would pass the N
into the kernel for the PPU profiling case.  To make the API clean, you
would have to create a new file entry to pass the LFSR value.  For SPU
profiling you would not pass N instead you would pass LFSR.  I think it
is a bad idea to have these two different things for PPU versus SPU
profiling.  I really feel it is best to consistent to use pass N for PPU
and SPU.  Then deal with converting N to the LFSR for the special case
of SPU profiling.  
Unlike POWER 4/5 support where we absolutely had to add entries to the
API to pass the three values for the control registers.  We already have
an established mechanism for passing N from user to kernel.  Just use
it.  We are very sure that John Levon, the OProfile user maintainer,
will say the same thing and refuse to accept adding to the API to pass
the LFSR when the whole thing can be handled in a more consistent way
that does not require an architecture specific change.  And I also feel
that we really don't need or want an additional architecture specific
API change.

I don't see any advantage in this log approach.  If we do this with a
linear table with a reasonable number of pre calculated values.  I think
that a table with no more then 1024 entries would be reasonable.  The
overhead for calculating the desired LFSR value would be going through
the for loop 16K times, for 1024 entries in the table, is not
unreasonable.  I think this whole discussion of moving the LFSR to the
user space is not needed.  The overhead of the for loop does not justify
pushing the LFSR determination to user space.  But that is just my
opinion.  I am open to suggestions on how big to make the lookup table
in the kernel.  But I really am apposed to putting the LFSR into the
user space.

I don't agree.  But that is just my opinion based on my experience
working on OProfile.
