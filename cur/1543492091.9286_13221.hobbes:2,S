One of the machines I work on at work (of all places) is a Dual PPro system
(Intel Providence PR440FX motherboard). It's been running stock 2.0.36 (w/
SMP turned on) for the past couple of months w/o any trouble. A few days
ago, I decided to give 2.2.x a whirl. After compiling and installing, I
rebooted and everything looked fine until I ran dmesg which printed out:
vector 7 on CPU#0!
unexpected IRQ vector 7 on CPU#0!
(ad infentum)
When I went to look at the system (it's not in my cube), the console was a
continuous stream of "unexpected IRQ vector 7 on CPU#0!". However, this
error message is the only indication that there's some sort of problem;
everything appears to run just fine (the response time for Bugzilla has
even gone down a little bit) and 2.2.5 takes about 2/3 the time of 2.0.36
to boot.
Much thanks,
Noah Romer
