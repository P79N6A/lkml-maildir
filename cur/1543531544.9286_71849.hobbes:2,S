    Andreas, these are special. If you go and buy new keyboard, it will
    have those nasty keys. It is not like those "multimedia" keys which
    differ from keyboard to keyboard -- this is more like L-window,
    R-window and Menu "windows95" keys.
I know. It is a Microsoft standard. See
	
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-1.html#ss1.8
[Still, the Microsoft Internet keyboards one can buy here today
do not yet have these keys.]
The patch is harmless, and vaguely useful, and superfluous:
if the purpose of the kernel patch is to attach uses via loadkeys,
then without the patch one needs setkeycodes followed by loadkeys.
(And for many keyboards setkeycodes would remain necessary
because these three are not the only new keys.)

[I just added a ref to setkeycodes(8) in showkey(1).]
