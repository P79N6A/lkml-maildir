Is this true?  platform_device_register uses pdev.name to construct the
bus id.  pdev.name is also used when matching against drivers.
However, once a platform device is unregistered, it is no longer available
to be matched against drivers, so pdev.name is unused.  Therefore, I don't
think this is a problem.

This isn't how we prevent modular builds...

We prevent them by setting this to 'bool'.

It doens't really depend on SERIAL_8250 - it can live independently of it.
However, it can be built in when SERIAL_8250 isn't, so this dependency
should be SERIAL_8250 != n.
