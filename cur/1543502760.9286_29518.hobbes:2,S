Gerard, I am stuck in Australia for 2 weeks, but I had to comment on
this before returning.  Some of the cases you mention of PCI write
posting and other issues on the Sun controllers are handled, and in
fact their behavior is configurable in the registers of the
controllers themselves.  I cannot comment specifically on each point
without my array of manuals, but I will be sure to do so when I return
from this trip.
Yes, the Sun controllers are different, but in fact you are blowing
the situation _WAY_ out of proportion.
Later,
