well, promise still didnt release any decent drivers but i saw "Support for
IDE Raid controllers" (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID) and "Support Promise software
RAID (Fasttrak(tm))" (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_PDC) appearing in 2.4.1x (where
x>10 and x<13 i think) recently.....but they are still undocumented of
course...so could anyone please give me information on them? do they make
fasttrak 100 raid1 possible?
