Subject: [PATCH 1/3] lguest: fix sense if IF flag on interrupt injection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/148

The sense of the IF bit is backwards in the host interrupt handling.
This means we always save "IF=1" on the stack when injecting an
interrupt.  It turns out this is almost always correct (unless the
guest is taking a page fault in an interrupt due to an unpopulated
vmalloc mapping), so went unnoticed.
