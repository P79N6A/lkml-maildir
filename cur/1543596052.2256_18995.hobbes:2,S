Subject: PATCH: drivers/char/vt.c allows virtually locking up nonnetworked machine

There is a problem concerning chvt. A normal user can run a
bash$ while [ 1 ]; do chvt 11; done
which cannot be killed using the console (only remotely, virtually never
on a nonnetworked multiuser machine). So I changed the kernel source code
so that only the superuser may change terminals.
Since renaming/deleting chvt is no solution (chvt is a simple ioctl call),
it seems to be the simplest way to prevent this. Console switching
using Ctrl-Alt-Fkey still works, as well as X, so probably there are
no implications in most cases.
But, since this may be too restrictive for some applications, I would
recommend making this a configuration option. Unfortunately I do not
know how to do this :(
