	I never looked in details at those issues. Some people claim
it works, but personally I always had touble with driver init (double
initialisation). I don't want to disable it if some embedded people
depend on it (stable kernel => stable feature list).
	My "solution" was to totally rework the driver init (and stack
init) in 2.5.X and put ample warning on my web page "use static at
your own risk".
