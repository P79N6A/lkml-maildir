Subject: PROBLEM: SMP lock ups on Intel SCB2 (2.4.19-2.4.21-pre4)

I tried linux kernels from 2.4.19 to 2.4.21-pre4 and all of them lock
up my server under heavy CPU load if i enable SMP. And after lookup i
have If i disable SMP
all works fine.
I tried win2K & winXP too and under this OSes both processors worked
fine under heavy load, but i like linux very much and hate win on
servers.
Please help me.
My hardware:
Intel SCB2 board with latest BIOS
Two PIII-1266MHz stepping 01
kernel lock ups after 10-30 minutes of heavy load with no messages on
console or in logs :(
But BIOS event log before lock up contain a lot of messages: Critical
interrupt #07.
Maybe it's hardware problem? But why windows still working fine for
more than 48h under heavy load ? :(
