The -mm patches live on kernel.org in pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/
The patch you want is the one to drivers/ide/ide-io.c although be aware
it will make non PCI ATA controllers crash on errors if applied. The
"right" fix for this is probably to have a hwif->flush_data() function
that defaults to try_to_flush_leftover_data() so that the knowledge
involved is not hacked into the ide core but kept in the driver.
