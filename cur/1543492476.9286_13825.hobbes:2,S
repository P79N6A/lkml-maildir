More weirdness:
Now, I don't see it on 2.2.5, gcc 2.7.2.3, Debian Slink + some
upgrades, dual PPRo 200, EEPro100, but a yesterday I tried it with
2.2.3 and saw the problem. I don't think I've updated netbase;
currently it's 3.12-2, and I don't know when I upgraded from the
3.11-1.2 in slink. Sorry I didn't note info on the exect config when I
did test it, but maybe other Debian people should see if
netbase_3.12-2 fixes it for them, too.
