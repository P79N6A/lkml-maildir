Roman,
I know this has come up before, but wasn't sure if any recent  
enhancements to Kconfig have resolved this issue.
We have a set of board choices in PPC land that are 'config' options.   
We want to make sure the user selects at least one of them (or force  
at least one of them to be selected).  Is there a way to do that?
thanks
