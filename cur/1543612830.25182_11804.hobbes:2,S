Hm, at first I got exactly the same results for writeback/ordered
cases, as you did above, so my theory fell on the ground.
Later, bloody thing resurected again. Something really fishy is goin'
on here...
 {atlas} [/mnt]# time ~zcalusic/try/awriter
 ~zcalusic/try/awriter  0.07s user 3.50s system 99% cpu 3.594 total
 {atlas} [/mnt]# cd /tmp
 {atlas} [/tmp]# time ~zcalusic/try/awriter
 ~zcalusic/try/awriter  0.00s user 6.05s system 98% cpu 6.129 total
 {atlas} [/tmp]# mount | egrep '/tmp|/mnt'
 /dev/hde2 on /tmp type ext3 (rw,data=writeback)
 /dev/hde3 on /mnt type ext3 (rw)
So /tmp is writeback and /mnt is ordered (doublechecked!). See for
yourself how ext3 is slower in writeback mode. awriter is your
small program, of course.
Just for the record, I mke2fs-ed /dev/hde3 again and made it pure
ext2.
 {atlas} [~]# mount | grep '/mnt'      
 /dev/hde3 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
 {atlas} [~]# cd /mnt
 {atlas} [/mnt]# time ~zcalusic/try/awriter
 ~zcalusic/try/awriter  0.01s user 1.86s system 98% cpu 1.893 total
To sumarize:
ext2            0.01s user 1.86s system 98% cpu 1.893 total
ext3/ordered    0.07s user 3.50s system 99% cpu 3.594 total
ext3/writeback  0.00s user 6.05s system 98% cpu 6.129 total
What is strange is that not always I've been able to get different
results for writeback case (comparing to ordered), but when I get it,
it is repeatable.
This is a SMP machine, if that makes any difference.
