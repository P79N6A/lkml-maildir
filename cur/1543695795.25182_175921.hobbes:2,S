You are missing mousedev that is the driver that actually provides
/dev/input/mice. usbmouse (which is actually redundand with hid) speaks
with hardware and mousedev speaks with user :)
The whole input subsystem has changed between 2.4 and 2.6. Unfortunately,
input sysbsystem hotplugging is not currently implemented. Your best bet
is to forcibly load mousedev during boot. Alternatively look into hotplug
for usermap, it allows provide fake mapping for modules - you could add
mapping from UDB IDs of oyur mouse to mousedev. Loading it statically is
likely to be more simple.
