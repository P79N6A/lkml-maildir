Yes, I just modeled it on some other similar Kconfigs.

In some way, the original line made sense to me:
	depends on USB_STORAGE && BLK_DEV_IDE
where we have:        =y       &&     =m
so if USB_STORAGE_ISD200 were a tristate, it would have been limited
to 'm', but since it's a bool, it's not limited.
New patch is below.

Limit USB_STORAGE_ISD200 to whatever BLK_DEV_IDE and USB_STORAGE
are set to (y, m) since isd200 calls ide_fix_driveid() in the
BLK_DEV_IDE code.

 	  Say Y here if you want to use USB Mass Store devices based
 	  on the In-Systems Design ISD-200 USB/ATA bridge.
