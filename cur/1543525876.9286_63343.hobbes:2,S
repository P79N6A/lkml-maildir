See  fib_validate_source() in net/ipv4/fib_fronend.c on what it does
It checks on per device basis. So it should check the value in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/$device/rp_filter for an interface that is already up.
the all values if I recall correctly are copied as defaults at device init. So
they affect newly config'ed devices.
