It shouldn't be enabled for 2.95, there are known miscompilations
caused by it there.  The i386 Makefile enforces this:
cflags-$(CONFIG_REGPARM) 	+= $(shell if [ $(GCC_VERSION) -ge 0300 ] ; then echo "-mregparm=3"; fi ;)
However this points to a bug in that when someone sets this
on 2.95 the assembly functions who check for CONFIG_REGPARM
explicitely will be subtly miscompiled. Perhaps having 
a #error for this case would be better, although that
would break allyesconfig on prehistoric compilers. Maybe 
it needs to be special cased in autoconf.h
