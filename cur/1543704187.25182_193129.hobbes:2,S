Yes, there are going to be a lot of these.   Lots of code does
foo.h:
	extern inline void foo(void);
foo.c:
	inline void foo(void) 
	{
	}
and latest gcc generates an error in this case (with the options we're
currently using, at least).
The fix is to remove the `inline' from the declaration in foo.h.  It's the
right thing to do anyway, so I'm thinking we should just get in there and
fix them all up.
