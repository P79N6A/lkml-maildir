   Is anybody looking into fixing this bug ?
According to sct (who's sitting next to me in my hotel room at ALS) Ben
LaHaise has a bugfix for this, but it hasn't been merged.

   Haven't been able to reproduce it on my 1GB test machine,
   but it might still be there. Can anyone confirm if this
   bug is still present ?
Note: all of the issues on the TODO list with the "VM:" prefix are from
a VM todo list you posted a week or two ago; so I'm assuming that you
know more about those issues than I do.....  (feel free to send me an
updated list and I'll merge it into the 2.4 TODO list.)
