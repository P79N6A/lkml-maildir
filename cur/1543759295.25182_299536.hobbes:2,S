I don't see how one can do that.  As I pointed out in my reply to
Jeff, it actually requires understanding how the driver uses the
different MSI-X vectors to know which vector we need to synchronize
against.  So it seems pci_irq_sync() would have to be psychic.
If we can figure out how to do that, maybe we can consolidate a lot
more code into an API like
	void do_what_i_mean(void);
;)
