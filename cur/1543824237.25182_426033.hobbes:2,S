Yep.  I bungle my description pretty badly.
The key points.
-  Simply messing with pid == 1 is not enough, you need to filter
   which pids are accessible.
-  pid isolation by permission checks and pid isolation via
   pid visibility are competing implementations.
-  pid isolation by permission checks (except for the pid == 1 case)
   can currently be implemented with a security module.
