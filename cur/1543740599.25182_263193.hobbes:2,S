I can't really object to backing this out, but I'll just point out
that without this patch, in the situations where mainline builds at
all, it still overwrites files in lib/zlib_inflate/.  (And builds with
O=xxx don't work at all)
It might make more sense to leave this patch in for now and beg Sam
for a better fix in the future.
Thanks,
  Roland
