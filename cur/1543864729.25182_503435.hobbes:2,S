As one who regularly fills a sponsor slot (though I have also gotten
an invitation on merit in the past), I don't believe the sponsor slot
people detract from the sessions.  Most of the time we keep quiet,
occasionally offering our insights or challenges.  Jonathan's writeups
are fantastic, but it doesn't really compare with being there and
participating in discussions, either hallway or main room.  Besides
consuming oxygen, what's the real concern here?
Thanks,
Matt
