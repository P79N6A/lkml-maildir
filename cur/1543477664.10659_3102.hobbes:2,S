Trouble is, that doesn't patch cleanly. Redhat distributes patches
along with pristine source in the SRPMs, allowing you to upgrade the
source and still use the patches. If you have multiple patches fighting
over the EXTRAVERSION line, or Linus decides to remove it after the
-pre series, you get rejects.
