Subject: [PATCH 00/22][RFC] Unionfs: Stackable Namespace Unification Filesystem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/31/309

This set of patches constitutes Unionfs version 2.0. We are presenting it to
be reviewed and considered for inclusion into the kernel.
Unionfs is a stackable filesystem that is based off of the FiST stackable
filesystem framework written by Erez Zadok: see <
http://filesystems.org/>.
Josef Sipek presented Unionfs at the 2006 Ottawa Linux Symposiums; the
high-level overview from this year's symposium starts on page 349 of the
second half of the symposium proceedings:  see
  <
http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2006/linuxsymposium_procv2.pdf>
Note that this set of patches contains a considerably trimmed-down version
of Unionfs.  That way it'd be possible to evaluate Unionfs's most basic
functionality, gradually adding features in future patches.
To download tarballs of the full source, along with userspace utilities,
read various documents and other info about Unionfs, see the home page at

Known Issues and Limitations:
- The NFS server returns -EACCES for read-only exports, instead of -EROFS.
  This means we can't reliably detect a read-only NFS export.
- Modifying a Unionfs branch directly, while the union is mounted, is
  currently unsupported.  Any such change may cause Unionfs to oops and it
  can even result in data loss!
- The PPC module loading algorithm has an O(N^2) loop, so it takes a while
  to load the Unionfs module, because we have lots of symbols.
- Unionfs shouldn't use lookup_one_len on the underlying fs as it confuses
  NFS.
For the initial release we removed support for xattrs, persistent inode
mappings, and mmap operations.
