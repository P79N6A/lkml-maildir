Does not help. Same problem. Let me clarify "freeze", though. I mean it
takes out the machine -- the kernel does not run processes. The machine
might as well be turned off; it'd do as much good.
Unfortunately, no oopses. No backtraces. No entries in
/var/log/messages. Nothing. It just dies.
A rather serious kernel bug, IMO.
cc'd to l-k. It's 2.2.14 running on a ppp-603ev.
