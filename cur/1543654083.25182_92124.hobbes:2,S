Subject: [PATCH] make 2.5.49 mount root again for devfs users
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/25/50

init/do_mounts.c changed in 2.5.48, and booting with devfs
(and without initial ramdisk) has been impossible since then.  
I experimented with do_mounts undoing the early devfs mount.  
Devfs is mounted later anyway.
Feel free to test, but be warned that I am not an expert
on this part of the kernel.  This made 2.5.49 work for
me though.  I hope someone can comment on this.
If it isn't "the right way" please tell what is.
