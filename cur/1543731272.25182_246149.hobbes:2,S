Patchset update. These are patches designed to improve system 
responsiveness with specific emphasis on the desktop, but configurable 
to any workload.

Patches (with split-out also):
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.8.1/2.6.8.1-ck5/
Added since ck4:
+s8.0_s8.1
Sync with latest staircase patch. Tiny fix affecting very short running 
tasks that use a lot of cpu (like xmame).
+mapped_watermark_fix.diff
+sc_mw.diff
Mapped watermark was released a touch too early and was too aggressive 
leading to an oom easily. These fix that, make it more efficient and 
make it possible to properly inactivate it by setting mapped to 0.
+1g_change_config.diff
Change the 1Gb lowmem so that the default is off (thanks for suggestion 
Michael Buesch)
