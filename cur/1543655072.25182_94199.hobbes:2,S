Not really. When X closes /dev/fb then fb_release is called which if the 
driver supports it will switch back to text mode. The exception is 
firmware based fbdev drivers like vesafb and offb.

X has to reset the vidoe hardware back to the state that matches what the 
VESA mode was. Other wise it will mess you your system.
P.S
    X on VESA fb always foobars my system when I exit X.
