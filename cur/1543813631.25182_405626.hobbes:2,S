Subject: [PATCH] Trivial removal of long incorrect address for Jamie Lokier
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/11/77

I know for a fact Jamie hasn't lived here for at least 5 years; a friend
now owns it and while it's all well and good being able to find his
postcode by grepping a kernel tree it should really go I guess.
