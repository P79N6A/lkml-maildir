Would you care to explain the rationale for this, please.  If the driver
had been riddled with errors and compilation problems, I might have
acquiesced, but now I come to look it over, it seems structurally
reasonably OK (we certainly have non-BROKEN worse ones) plus it compiles
fine.  So I'm wondering why it's marked broken in the first place.
Since it was your original patch:

    [PATCH] Mark more drivers BROKEN{,ON_SMP}
    
    - let more drivers that don't compile depend on BROKEN
    - MTD_BLKMTD is fixed, remove the dependency on BROKEN
    - let all drivers that don't compile on SMP (due to cli/sti usage)
      depend on a BROKEN_ON_SMP that is only defined if !SMP || BROKEN
    - #include interrupt.h for dummy cli/sti/... in two files to fix the
      UP compilation of these files
    
    I marked only drivers that are broken for a long time and where I don't
    know about existing fixes with BROKEN or BROKEN_ON_SMP.
I'd like to know why it was marked BROKEN in the first place.
Thanks,
James
