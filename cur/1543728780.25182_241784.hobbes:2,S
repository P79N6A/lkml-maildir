There are five on int10. ;) It's worse on my desktop box with six devices on 
int11. But hey, Linux works just fine so I never cared.
Yes, /proc/interrupts from .26 and .27 is the same.

Yes.

I've attached three boots with .27. One without any parameters, one with 
acpi=off and pci=noacpi (the way I booted previous kernels).
It seems I've found the problem. The network errors were caused by the 
pci=noacpi boot parameter. Once I boot without any parameter or acpi=off it 
works just fine.
Btw, how can I boot with ACPI disabled? I thought it was acpi=off, but it 
doesn't seem to make any difference, the kernel still uses ACPI (see 
dmesg-2.4.27-acpi=off.gz attachement).
Also there must have been some (positive) changes to ACPI in 2.4.27? With 
earlier kernels I had this problem:
Feb 6 18:31:27 spot kernel: PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing
Feb 6 18:31:27 spot kernel: PCI: if you experience problems, try using option 
'pci=noacpi' or even 'acpi=off'
[...]
Feb 6 18:31:27 spot kernel: PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 
00:11.1 - using IRQ 255
This seems to have been corrected as of 2.4.27. I still get the
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:11.1
warning, but it doesn't assign IRQ 255 anymore which I take as a good sign. :)
So, it seems to work fine now. If you still want me to test something 
regarding ACPI on this mainboard feel free to ask.
Thanks for your help,
Oliver
