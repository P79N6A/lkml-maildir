Subject: find a file containing a specific sector

For the last 7 months, I've been getting the following error in 
/var/log/messages every night during the cron.daily execution.  I've finally
tracked it down to happening during my tripwire run, and I suspect
(based on linear time into the run, and sizes of files) the problem file
lies somwhere in /usr/lib.
The error message has been identical for months, so I assume I have a bad 
spot that is not spreading.  I'd like to find the affected file, rename it
and ignore the problem for a while longer.
If I know the sector and lbasector, can I determine the inode and/or
the actual file affected?
The error message is:
Jan 23 04:24:34 helium kernel: hdc: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
Jan 23 04:24:34 helium kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=4200315, sector=4200248 
Jan 23 04:24:34 helium kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:01 (hdc), sector 4200248 
as I said before, the sector number has never changed in months.
thanks,
-chuck
