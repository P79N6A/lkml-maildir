VMware is fine. If you have any problem with vmware modules loaded, run
a test without them and if you can't duplicate it tell vmware.

So if you add lots of crap to your box it falls over. Thats _your_ problem
or your vendors problem. If you have a Red Hat kernel problem and you have
a support deal you go demand they fix it. They sold it to you. If you don't
you stick it in Bugzilla and they might fix it for you
Ditto for SuSE, Mandrake and everyone else.
There is a real incentive for vendors not to fiddle with the tree unless
they think they know what they are doing. The resource overhead it creates
them is significant.
