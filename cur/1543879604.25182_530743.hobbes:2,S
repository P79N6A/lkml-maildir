Its never safe for a brightness_set handler to sleep. They're designed
to be called from interrupt context and as you've noted, several
triggers do that.
The solution if you have locks like your case is to offload the work to
a workqueue, there is simply no other way to do it.
I'll have a look to see if I can improve the documentation (patches
welcome).

Someone else has mentioned this within the past few days and there is a
problem with the trigger->activate and ->deactivate calls occurring
within a spinlock. Its not a simple problem to solve unfortunately and
you can't just convert to a mutex but I'm looking at it. Again, patches
welcome but its going to need careful thought.
