I take a strong objection to this. I can't speak for all distros, but I
know that Red Hat has a strong preference to get things merged upstream as
soon as possible. I think you are absolutely wrong about the "no
real benefit" part and that you totally misunderstand what value add
distributions provide.

this is not about distros or vendors (yes IBM is a linux vendor too). at
all. Marcelo is in a tough position; either he releases an emergency
kernel with a patch applied that seems to have a few corner case issues,
or he starts to rush out 2.4.21 based on the current
2.4.21-pre codebase. Given that there are other bugs in 2.4.20
that makes people say "but THIS needs to be in too", I can see
that becoming a very fuzzy thing pretty quick. Apparantly Marcelo decided
to go for the "get 2.4.21 out soon" approach.....
