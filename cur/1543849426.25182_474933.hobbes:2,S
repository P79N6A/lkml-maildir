I think you mis-diffed this one:
- 	WARN_ON(skb->protocol == 0);
That line doesn't exist in my copy of net/core/netpoll.c
even with your first patch applied.
Also, you forgot to remove the ->drop callback pointer
from struct netpoll, which you should do if it really
isn't used any more.
I think you might run into problems there, as I believe the netdump
stuff does make non-trivial use of the ->drop callback.  Indeed, it
uses the ->dump callback for invoking a special
netpoll_start_netdump() function.  I'm pretty sure ->dump was created
specifically to accomodate netdump.
So this is something else which will need to be worked out before we
can apply this patch.
