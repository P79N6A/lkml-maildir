Very nice, thanks! A couple of remarks from an absolute git newbie:
1. I heard "git am" is supposed to supersede apply-mbox
2. What I often have problems with is - what to do if git spits at me a 
bunch of conflict messages after a seemingly safe pull or similar. Don't 
know if you want to cover those points but "git troubleshooting" would 
definitely be a valuable document.
Thanks
