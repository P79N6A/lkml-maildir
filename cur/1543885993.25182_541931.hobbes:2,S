Of course, one could argue that since all of those were obsolete by the
time Linux was first created, that it probably doesn't matter and that
isVGA == 0 pretty much means the more obvious thing.
MDA/HGC stuck around for quite a while for debugging, since it was
non-conflicting with VGA, but even if it is, the reason people put it in
their system is to have something that the OS doesn't readily see.
