[ I've been waiting what seems like centuries for someone

I'll responsd by asking questions of you.
Do you know how source address selection works when the user tries to
connect to a remote location yet doesn't specify a specific source
address to use?
Once you understand source address selection, the next thing
you need to do is:
1) consider how you might want to make that configurable
   by the user
2) what the default behavior should be
3) what kind of ARP behavior is necessary in order for
   these various configurations to work
