Hi,
	2.3.39 cannot compile w/o isapnp.  This drivers/pnp/isapnp.c is
compiled even if itis config-ed OFF.  However, in that case some header
files are not included, and so the compilation fails.
	However, if I DO include isapnp (not as a module), then it
  1) does not detect my modem
  2) sets up the card wrong, so that
  3) my modem (ttyS1) is no longer detected on boot.
Perhaps ISAPNP should not automatially activate cards that it can't
detect?  I suppose compiling ISAPNP as a module might work, but I
haven't tried that yet.
Thanks,
-BenRI
