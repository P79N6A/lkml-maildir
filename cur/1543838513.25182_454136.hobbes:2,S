At the moment, the cpu hotplugging/unplugging is done outside of
freezing processes because once we've frozen processes we can't (afaik)
move ones that are tied to the cpu being unplugged to another processor,
and won't also be able to kill kernel threads that are tied to the
processor(s) being taken down.
Personally, I wouldn't mind being seeing this addressed as I see a few
other benefits to being able to hot[un]plug later, besides simplifying
life for the cpufreq-applet (although it shouldn't crash if a cpu is
offlined anyway).
Regards,
Nigel
