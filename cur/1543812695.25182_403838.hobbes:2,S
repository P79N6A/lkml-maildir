This is really small machine. Yes, it is an exception...
..and you could modify cron to know about AC power. Something like "do
every day at 4 am if you are on AC power; delay it if you are on DC
power, but for no more than 3 days"... should do the trick.
Actually that modification to cron would be probably useful for
non-updatedb stuff, too....
