Hmmm... you're right Marcelo, sorry for the confusion. When I saw
'link_path_walk' in Dimitris' trace, it recalled me something, and I saw
the recent fix for an oops which I thought related, but apparently not.

I don't know, but clearly if it's doing dirty tricks, it's not surprizing
that even small changes from 2.4.29 to 2.4.30 can trigger or hide the bugs.
He should try to decorellate openafs and kernel versions. Trying 1.3.82 on
top of 2.4.29 (or even -hf) would probably show that he gets the same bugs
as on 2.4.30, thus leading to the conclusion that the difference lies in
the openafs upgrade.
Cheers,
Willy
