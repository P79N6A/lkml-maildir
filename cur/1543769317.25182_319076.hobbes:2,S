Yes I just realized my mistake, OK I'll try the patches against -mm2
along with a patch to update all the added device
callbacks/differences and make sure nothing goes horribly wrong with
it tomorrow. BTW I sent a patch against it87.c to lm_sensors so Jean
could test things (apparently adm1026 hasn't got many users).
Thanks again,
Yani
