Well I do know at least some of the things that depend on experimental
are legitimate.
I wonder if the problem is that we don't police experimental well
enough.

I can see a distribution carefully cherry picking things, that the
have an intimate knowledge about out of experimental but it doesn't
sound right for taking things out of EXPERIMENTAL to be routine.
I know I'm a little slow about getting around to it but when ever I
have a feature that isn't EXPERIMENTAL anymore I remove the tag.
