Funny. I've been having problems at least since 2.6.13 (perhaps before; my 
memory is broken) with my Asus P5GDC-V Deluxe and 4 WD drives. I've seen DMA 
timeouts on my serial console, followed by an immediate kernel freeze in 
which Magic SysRQ doesn't even respond.
I have yet to experience the freezing behavior on 2.6.15 (though I think I may 
have seen errors in dmesg at one point), but then again, I've been a victim 
of a slab leak which means I haven't maintained much of an uptime under 
2.6.15.
I'm working on debugging the slab leak at the moment... unfortunately, I don't 
know enough about SATA to really debug this issue. Bisecting would take 
forever because it usually takes several days before I ever experience a 
random freeze.
Nevertheless, if anyone has any pointers, I'd really like to start to wring 
some of these bugs out of my kernel.
