Well it looks like I've lost my analog output in 2.6.14-rc2 (headphones on
the LiveDrive work fine though).
My card is now reported as a SBLive! Platinum 5.1 [SB0060] and i've been
loading the modules with the following:
extin=0x3fc3 extout=0x1fc3 enable_ir=1
It's been working fine until the latest git updates. I'll try
again tonight if I get the time.
