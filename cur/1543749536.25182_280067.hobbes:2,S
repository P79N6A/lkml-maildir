The i_sock member of struct inode is redundant with S_ISSOCK(i_mode).
Here's a series of 6 patches to remove it:
http://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/willy/patches/i_sock/
I'm sending them to their respective maintainers now, and I'll submit
a series after 2.6.10 is out.
Removing i_sock from struct inode actually doesn't reduce the size of
struct inode -- it fits into a gap between two other members.  But it may
help someone else put struct inode on a diet, and it reduces confusion.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
