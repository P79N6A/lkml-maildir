Not really thinking about how hard it would be to implement, I suggest
that the appropriate place for this to be, would be a mount option.
Just as 'noatime', or 'sync', perhaps a 'delaywrite' option would be a
good choice. An advantage of this approach, is that I could make /tmp
be 'delaywrite+journal' in an effort to improve the efficiency of
/tmp, as I could care less what I lost in /tmp between reboots under
extreme situations.
