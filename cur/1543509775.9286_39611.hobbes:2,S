Subject: a subtle bug of ext2 or e2fsck ?  (fwd)

hi, there,
I recently have had some troubles with my file systems.  e2fsck (1.14 )
reports ``Error reading block #### (Attempt to read block from filesystem
resulted in short read) while doing inode scan. Ignore error<y>".  I
answered 'y'.  However, I got more and more such errors. Eventually, I got
''Attempt to read black from filesystem resulted in short read while
trying to open /dev/hda3''. 
I have three partitions from dev/hda1 to /dev/hda3 and I have the same
problems with all three partitions.  I reformatted dev/hda1 and it seems
fine. So this is not a hardware problem. 
Do you have any idea what is happening here?  Is there any tool that I
still can recover my data on /dev/hda3?  Debugfs and dumpe2fs all failed
to open the file system on /dev/hda3. I was too stupid to backup my files.
Your help is greatly appreciated.
Hao
