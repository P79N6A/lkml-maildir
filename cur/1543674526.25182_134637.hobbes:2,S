Hi all folks!
I hope I'm posting this to the right list:
Recently, I wanted to set up my box to kernel 2.4.20 and I built a kernel as I 
made it many times before. But from now on, my kernels are not longer able to 
load modules. Meanwhile I' ve built kernels with most of gcc versions (2.95.3 
- 3.3) and linux versions 2.4.18 - 20, but without any success. The modutils 
are up to date (gentoo .ebuild) and I removed the modules dir and ran 'make 
mrproper'.
This error I get trying to load a module:
***
root@tinagrar:~ $ modprobe 3c59x
/lib/modules/2.4.20.deever/kernel/drivers/net/3c59x.o: unresolved symbol

While booting the kernel, following problems ocurr:

That's all I can report, if you need my .config file for autopsy, please ask! 
;) (But I don't think that something is wrong there)
Thank you for helping people!
