This looks like an attempt to implement temporal affinity.  Here's an
alternative idea for this (I haven't implemented it and I don't have any
performance experience with it, it's just an idea):
When you switch from process A to process B, if process B has a very short
avg_slice retain ownership of A by leaving its has_cpu=1 and make a note of
it in some local state (probably schedule_data).  This keeps other CPUs from
taking A away.  When process B gives up the CPU (and we expect this will
happen in a very short amount of time) we can switch back to A in O(1) time.
Most of this can be done in __schedule_tail().  In fact, reschedule_idle()
already has a test for avg_slice and pretty much my proposal would have a
similar test in __schedule_tail() and depending on the result we would either 
retain ownership of the descheduled process or go into reschedule_idle().
There are some other pitfalls to deal with, such as making sure we don't try
to hold more than one process at a time, but they appear trivial.
