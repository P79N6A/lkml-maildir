Ok, that's legitimate. In such case , we'll have to modify shell to
understand something like --drop, so that beggining of shell would
look like
#!/bin/bash --drop NET_BIND_SERVICE
. Which again has nice property like surviving NFS/ftp transfers etc.

Hm, so java will have to be modified. OR you'll have to modify kernel
not to pass scriptname to interpretter (as it currently does) but to
pass open fd. Passing open fd of program being executed might allow us
to honour setuid bits on scripts etc.

Having capabilities in namespace will not help you much - you'll have
to fix passing script fd to script interpretter, first. When do you
expect utilities like tar and cp capabilities-aware? I do not think it
will be widespread before 2002 or so.
BTW you certainly will not be stuck with this decission forever. You
can drop  it at any time. As long as this hack is used wisely
(i.e. only limiting capabilities of current programs), you can drop it
and system will return to 2.2 situation.

PS: It would be pretty nice to invent new "is_capability_enhanced"
marker into filesystems, so I could drop "set euid back to ruid" hack;
but again that is lot of work and quite a big semantic change.
