ehhh ... same results.
Interestingly enough, a few people posted and emailed that they hade no
problems with their SiS630E chipsets, and offering various theories
therein.
My vendor had a SiS630E board that was going to be RMA'd (broken ps/2 port
for mouse of all damned things), so he quickly built a system around it, I
ssh'ed in, copied over 2.4.14, and make dep took a whopping 37 seconds or
so, with make (on a .config with everything either added in or as a
module) about 6.5 minutes.
So, no, whatever magic molassas infects my SiS630 boards does not seem to
extend to the SiS630E.
