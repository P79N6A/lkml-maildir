The locks.h code only works while holding the kernel lock.
If you want a SMP-safe non-kernel-lock thing, you need to use the real
semaphores (which is usually simpler anyway, and faster than the locks.h
version: the only real reason to ever use the locks.h kind of lock is
purely historical in old code).
Easiest way to use a semaphore:
	DECLARE_MUTEX(random_semaphore);
	#define random_lock()	down(&random_semaphore)
	#define random_unlock()	up(&random_semaphore)
and you're done.
