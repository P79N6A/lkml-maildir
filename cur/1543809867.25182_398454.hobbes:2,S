Hi there,
Following is a small series of patches to fix up the changes recently made
to the runtime suspend/resume functionality.
The sysfs interface was changed so that it dropped the actual state that
the device was requested to enter. These patches add a state field to
pm_message_t, so that the bus and device drivers can the use value written
to the sysfs file to choose the proper state to enter.
pci_choose_state() is fixed up to check for a non-zero value when the
request is for a PM_EVENT_SUSPEND message and return the appropriate D
state. This allows D1 and D2 to be used once again (though there are few
drivers that currently support it). The BUG() is also converted to a more
friendly WARN_ON(1) when an invalid state is entered.
Finally, the device suspend/resume code is now liberated from an
unconditional deadlock when SMP is enabled.
Please apply. Thanks,
	Pat
