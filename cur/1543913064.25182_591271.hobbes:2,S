as i mentioned it above, in the first level review i'm mainly interested 
in your patch's behavior wrt. simple nice-0 tasks, how they run and how 
they sleep and wake up. Nothing else. Why? That's what 99% of the Linux 
tasks do after all. So could you please confirm whether that aspect of 
what i wrote (both in words and in code) is correct?
If this basic model is correct, we can look further. If this basic model 
is flawed, no amount of weighting, nice level logic, rounding behavior 
can fix it. I'm sure you agree with that too.
That's why i wrote this prototype, please confirm or deny whether i 
correctly understood how you intend to handle nice-0 tasks. (From your 
mails i read a part-acknowledgement of that but i'd like to see a more 
clear acknowledgement - or please mention any issues if you know about 
them.) Thanks!
