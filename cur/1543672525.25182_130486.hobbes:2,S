   Look at e.g. the debian and redhat packages of ipsec-tools:  they all
   have their local copy of theses headers.
You merely support my point, the situation is rediculious.
Why don't we copy headers into every app package that wants to use
certain interfaces?
#ifdef SARCASM
Yeah, that sounds like an excellent idea.
#endif /* SARCASM */
This doesn't even consider the case where the ipsec-tools copy of the
headers becomes out of date with the kernel copy.  This isn't a
theoretical issue, this problem is real.
For example, I just changed the values of a few SADB_EALG_* values in
pfkeyv2.h.  Now ipsec-tools is effectively broken.  Oops, when will
the copy in ipsec-tools get updated?
What about applications, ie. normal ones, that want to pass IPSEC
policies into the kernel via the socket options we have that allows
per-socket IPSEC rules to be specified?  The copy in ipsec-tools
doesn't help them at all.
All of this is madness, and every suggestion to copy the headers
all over the place is a non-solution.
