It will be delayed as it's gone down my priority list.

No, that shouldn't be necessary.  Just use a container_of() wrapper 
model.  During fork() you're in the parent tasks context so should be 
able to access its state through "current".  Fork() is busily copying 
lots of the parent's state into the child so what you want to do should 
be no different.  If you've been using the wrapper idea, the notifier 
block that's passed into the call back code should give access to your 
data for the parent.
If you like I could give you some code snippets to show what I mean.
