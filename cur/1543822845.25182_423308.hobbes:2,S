But it is not fatal. Trust me. I am the author of most of the code.
The worst thing that can happen is that the card does not work.
The best thing that can happen is that it works with some luck.

You did not look close enough.

Well, the backtrace could be removed.
But I am for not removing the assertions completely, because
this way people don't see what is going on, if the device does not
work.
It is non-fatal in the sense that it does not crash the machine.
It _may_ be fatal, that the device does not work. The
driver is CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL for some reason.
To say it again: The 4318 is not completely supported, yet.
It may work with some luck, but it is not guaranteed and only
lower bitrates are supported.
