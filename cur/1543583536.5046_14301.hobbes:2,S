I have a user-space daemon for driving the watchdog.  I see it uses the
same user-space interface as sbc60xxwdt.c, except it can't be disabled :)
Did you write one too ?
Should we find somewhere to actually publish these watchdog-daemons ?
Or have I completely missed that there already is a place for these
daemons, and that there already exist publicly available daemons for
driving the sbc60xxwdt and ZFmicro ?
Btw. Alan, the documentation somehow got lost to the sbc60xxwdc driver
when you so kindly converted it to 2.4  -  it's here below  :)
