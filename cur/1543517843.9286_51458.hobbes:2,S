The new kernel is probably using the real mode AX=E801H/INT 15H
to get the total memory size. Since there are a few buggy old 386
BIOSes, this can happen. Your old version must have used the
standard AH=88H/INT 15H to get the memory size.
Since using MEM=xxx overrides the detection, you don't get
problems with this.
