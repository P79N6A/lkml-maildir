Hm, on further thought:
If guests writes to Vz pages are disallowed, then the only way out of Vz 
is if the guest sets it to something else (Uz,Sz).  If so, what's the 
point of using that state?  Why not make:
    Vr -> Uz      host discard
    Pr -> Uz      host discard clean
    Sp -> Uz      set volatile
    Uz -> Uz      set volatile
But given how you've described V-state pages, I really would expect 
writes to a Vz to work, or alternatively, all writes to V-state pages to 
be disallowed.  Are there any real uses for a writable Vr page?
On the other hand, removing Vz->Vr does clean up the dot graph a lot...
