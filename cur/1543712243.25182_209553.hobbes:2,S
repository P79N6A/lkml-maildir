In doing a web search on system clock speeds being too high, I found entries 
describing exactly what I am experiencing in the linux-kernel list archives, 
but have not yet found a resolution.
I have Mandrake 10.0, kernel-2.6.3-7mdk installed, on an IBM Thinkpad 1412 
laptop, celeron 366, 512MB RAM.  I am finding that my system clock is ticking 
away at a rate of about 3:1 vs reality, ie, I count ~3 seconds on the system 
clock for every 1 real second.  I am running ntpd but this is unable to keep 
up with the rate of system clock passage.  
I had to slow my keyboard repeat rate _way_ down in order to be able to type 
at all as well.   The system is limited, in that I have no way to alter the 
actual system clock (in bios at any rate).  The CPU is properly identified as 
a celeron 366.  
Does anyone have any enlightenment, or a fix, to offer?  The exact same 
software setup on a desktop system, Athlon XP2700+, has no such problems.
