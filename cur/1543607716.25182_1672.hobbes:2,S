I see what made its way in your code and your changelog.  As far as I
can see nothing contradicts description above.
 
1) You are maintainer of that code.
2) Couple of minutes of reading through it is enough to find a new hole.
3) There are dozens of such holes.
4) They had been there for years.
Conclusion:
You either can't see that stuff at all or you don't bother to spend even
minimal time looking for bugs.
See the problem with that situation?
