While the last statement is true, it's also nonsense.  IPX and IP don't
interoperate, and neither one cares how the other is encapsulated.  That
doesn't prevent lots of people trying to harmonize their IPX and IP
encapsulations, it just makes it totally wasted effort.

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
