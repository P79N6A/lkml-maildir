I think the query was more about why you'd need a struct which contains only 
an anonymous union - why not just have a named union?  Or do you anticipate 
adding extra fields to the struct later?
I guess that having a union foo * rather than a struct foo * would be a bit 
unconventional in the kernel.  The named struct / anonymous union combo does 
hide the union as merely an implementation detail, which is nice.  Was this 
your motivation?
Cheers,
