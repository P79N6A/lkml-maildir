Here are traces of a 145, 190, and 217 usec latencies in
netif_receive_skb:

http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.9-rc1-Q6#/var/www/2.6.9-rc1-Q6/trace3.txt
http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.9-rc1-Q6#/var/www/2.6.9-rc1-Q6/trace4.txt
Some of these are with ip_conntrack enabled, at the request of another
poster, this does not make much of a difference, it increases the worst
case latency by 20 usec or so.
Also there is the rt_garbage_collect issue, previously reported.  I have
not seen this lately but I do not remember seeing that it was fixed.
