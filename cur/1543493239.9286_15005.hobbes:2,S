Hi,
Reading this message I also have a question about this IO-Apic system. I've set
up a Linux system on a Dell Poweredge 2300 Dual P3-450 system with the PERC S/2
raidcontroller, the system runs fine with RH5.2 and kernel 2.2.3 but the IRQ
numbers seem odd:
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:    5410252    5404197    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:          0          8    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
 12:          0          0    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
 13:          1          0          XT-PIC  fpu
 16:       4442       4490   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx, aic7xxx
 18:     206824     206795   IO-APIC-level  megaraid
 20:    1318743    1318680   IO-APIC-level  Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100
Ethernet
Still, everything works OK, should I be concerned about these numbers ?
Gert
