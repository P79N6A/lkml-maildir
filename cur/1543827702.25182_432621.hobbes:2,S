Agreed.  It's taken me over a month here to realize that the particular
webserver in question (www.everymac.com) wasn't "dead", but merely being
blocked by my 2.6.17 kernel.  All was fine with 2.6.16, as I discovered today.
I wonder how many other "dead sites" there are out there,
that will be shut off from people when they "upgrade" to 2.6.17 ?
I'm a kernel hacker.  Most users of 2.6.17 will not be.
The default should be something that works "by default".
Cheers
