I get the same log messages here with 2.6.19.  I also noticed the following
messages when starting rpc.nfsd:
nfsd[1287]: nfssvc: writting fds to kernel failed: errno 0 (Success) 
nfsd[1287]: nfssvc: writting fds to kernel failed: errno 0 (Success) 
These messages appeared with kernel 2.6.19 too.  I however don't know if
this could be related to the other messages.
I use nfs-utils 1.0.10 on Debian Etch.
