It does a better job for near all the string.h stuff. x86-64 just uses
the builtins. Only exception  is memcpy, where it likes to call out of line 
memcpy when it is not absolutely sure about all the alignments 
(especally lots of casting causes that) 
Still having an empty (or the one from x86-64 ;) string.h should be fine.
