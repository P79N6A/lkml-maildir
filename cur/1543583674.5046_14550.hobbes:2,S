Ah. I went and looked up that chip ID at via's website, and saw only
southbridge chips, no USB-only chips at all. But, my real question was,
is there a way to get it to work right under Linux? I have two machines;
one is an Athlon with built-in (Via) USB support, and it seems to work
ok. I also have a P-200 that's my print server, file server and
(hopefully) scanner server. It is an old HX-chipset pre-USB socket-7
intel machine, but I've put a Via-chipset 2-port USB card into it. I
keep getting timeouts on it. I've looked all over the net for clues as
to what I can do to get it to work, and nothing has. Both uhci and
usb-uhci have the same problems. Is there a generic cause for timeout
problems when doing bulk transfers?
