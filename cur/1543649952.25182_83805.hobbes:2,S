I mean what you were referring to is called Chip-Multiprocessor (CMP),
architecturally. And probably, this is the cause of the confusion in the
discussions.
SMT is an orthogonal to it, and it is an established notion. You can have
SMT CMP, for example. So using "thread" for the cores in CMP is not proper
wording. It sounds something like "core" to me.  
In my mind, the processor hierarchy looks like:
	node    
	package (chip die)	
	core			
	thread

I don't understand. HT is one implementaion of (true) SMT. 
Thanks,

Agreed.  Siblings is probably best for HT stuff and threads
are probably best reserved for true SMT CPUs.
Then there's the SMP-on-a-chip, but we should probably just
call those CPUs.
