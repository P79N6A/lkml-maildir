 Attached is a patch to arch/i386/Kconfig for Linux 2.5.73.  I didn't change
any logic, only the help messages.  I've fixed typos, made some messages
more clear and concise, and used my experience as a native English speaker
to make some corrections.  Besides purely editorial changes, I've added some
details here and there, and updated things that sound as if they were
written when PCI was brand new, or computers without 387 FPUs were common :)
I left in some old-sounding stuff that adds character; It's fun to know
Linux isn't written by robots.  (yet :)
 Please CC: me on any replies, as I'm not subscribed to the lkml.  Let me
know if the kind of straight-to-the-point help message I've made is good, or
if more "this option is used for ..." would be better, in case I feel like
tackling another one of these files.
 Happy hacking,
