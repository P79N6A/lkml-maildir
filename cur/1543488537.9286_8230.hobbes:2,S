I'd like to chime in with a "me too!" on this one. Ever since I started
using an XServer on my windows98 box and running xterm off my linux box,
I've been getting random lockups. No log messages, no magic sysrq,
nothing. Just dead.
I can't reproduce this on whim, but it happens about once every 12 hours
or so (nothing patternized unfortunately - other than xterm ... if I
don't run it, nothing happens :(). 
I'm compiling 2.2.2-ac7 right now (been on 2.2.1-acX) to see it changes
things.
