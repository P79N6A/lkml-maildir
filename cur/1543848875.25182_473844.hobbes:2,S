I'm pretty sure this isn't an e1000 problem.  you need to talk to
whoever is maintaining the IRQ subsystem for x86.  E1000 is attempting
to register a shared interrupt and someone has already registered that
interrupt unshared.

looks like several devices are sharing IRQ 201 (aka GSI 16) and ahci
or usb uhci_hcd is likely the problem, or the (acpi) power management
subsystem.
Hope this helps get the right people involved.
