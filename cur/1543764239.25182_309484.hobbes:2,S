I don't know whether the PCMCIA problem is due to PCMCIA changes or not. 
The only thing I see having changed between 2.6.12-rc1-mm3 and
2.6.12-rc2-mm1 is the addition of pcmcia-resource-handling-fixes.patch. 
Would you have time to revert that, retest?  
There have been a few problem in the area of device management in
bk-driver-core.  I think we're getting that settled down now.
