a T21 is a ThinkPad 21 i take it
now from what i can see here there are a few
t21s out there, with different CPUs in them
but the network card appears to be
consistently 3Com made, which one isn't all
that clear to me here. Just check the cat
/proc/pci and you should get something like this:
 Bus  6, device   0, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Realtek
Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+
(rev 16).
      IRQ 11.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min
Gnt=32.Max Lat=64.
      I/O at 0x4800 [0x48ff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at
0x11000000 [0x110001ff].
(NOTE i've got a realtek PCMCIA card in this
notebook)
So under Device Drivers > Network Support 
You've got "Networking support" and "Network
device support" enabled
go into "Ethernet (10 or 100 MBti)" and
enable support for you card (as determined by
the cat /proc/pci) there is support for 3com
there.
good luck
