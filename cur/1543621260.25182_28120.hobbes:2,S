I think it's the right fix regardless. We should do as little as possible
from irq contexts, and that holds _doubly_ true if it mucks with things
like the page cache.

I'd really really hate to have the IO make pages go away from irq context
in 2.5.x too. I think async IO should always be started and cleaned up in
a user context - there simply isn't any reason not to (the notion of doing
an exit() or execve() with IO still pending to now-dead-memory is rather
horrible in itself).

Agreed. We should NEVER free the pages from the irq.
