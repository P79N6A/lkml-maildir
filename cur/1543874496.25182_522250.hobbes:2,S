Nodeid describes the node that the slab was allocated for which may 
not be equal to the node that the page came from. But if GFP_THISNODE is 
used then this should always be the same. That those two nodeid are 
different was certainly frequent before the GFP_THISNODE work went in. Now 
it may just occur in corner cases. Perhaps during bootup on 
some machines that boot with empty nodes. I vaguely recall a powerpc 
issue.
> Is it possible virt_to_slab(objp)->nodeid being different from pfn_to_nid(objp) ?
It is possible the page allocator falls back to another node than 
requested. We would need to check that this never occurs.
If we are sure then we could drop the nodeid field completely.
