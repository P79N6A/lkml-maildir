Mike, this is indeed the pragmatic approach I've advocated: as the VFS would
come up with more unioning-related functionality, I could easily make use of
it in unionfs, thus shrinking the code base in unionfs (while keeping the
user API unchanged).  In the end, what'll be left over is probably a smaller
standalone file system that offers the kind of features that aren't likely
to show up at the VFS level (e.g., a persistent cache of unified dir
contents, persistent inode numbers, whiteouts that work with any "obscure"
filesystem, and such).
