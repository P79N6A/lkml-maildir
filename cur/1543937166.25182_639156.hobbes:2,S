There's no reason there can't be.  It just needs a policy deciding.  Do we
have:
 (1) One control for all.
 (2) One control for all non-root users; no quotas on root.
 (3) One control for root, one control for all non-root users.
 (3) Separate controls for all users.
Should this be a ulimit?  Should a non-root user be able to adjust their own
quotas within limits set by root?
How should the quota be accessed?  The obvious way is to have /proc or /sys
controls.
Non-root quotas tend to be transitory.  When the user_struct pinning them goes
out of scope, they tend to disappear.  How do we recover the settings, if at
all?
