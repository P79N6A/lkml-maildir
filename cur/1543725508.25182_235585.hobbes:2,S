I think a great many drivers could be cleaned up
by making IO fail if the proper IO address cookies
haven't been obtained. This might be done with
byteswapping, XOR, addition, putting a checksum in
the top 2 bytes of a 64-bit cookie, or simply
tracking where an ioremap has been done. Then the
read and write operations can check this.
In general, make IO fail if a driver doesn't play
by the rules.
Perhaps some of the low memory-mapped stuff on
x86 could be moved.
