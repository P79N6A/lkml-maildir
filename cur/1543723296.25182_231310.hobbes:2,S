Ok, that answers my question, thanks.  ARM and ARM26 are fine with PROT_NONE.
Those are the "ldrlst" instructions in getuser.S, right?
Here's a question, for ARM only (not ARM26):
...........................................
getuser.S uses "ldrlst", but unlike ARM26 has no TASK_SIZE check and
matching "ldrge".  If kernel C code uses set_fs(), then get_user()
_should_ permit reading from kernel addresses.  Will that work on ARM?
I ask because it's interesting to see that ARM and ARM26 have quite
different code in getuser.S and putuser.S.  The ARM code is shorter.
Here's an optimisation idea, for ARM26 only:
...........................................
Do you need the "strlst" instructions in putuser.S?  They're followed
by "strge" instructions.
For storing, it looks as though the protections set in pgtable.h will
trigger a write fault whether it's a user mode access or not.  Thus
you _might_ be able to shave an instruction or two off each put_user,
by simply doing a single unconditional kernel mode store.  (The check
against TASK_SIZE has already been done).
Just an idea, I don't know ARM26 well enough to know if that'd work.
