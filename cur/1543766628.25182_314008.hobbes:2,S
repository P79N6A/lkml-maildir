I will continue to use bk
until an alternative emerges that makes my role
as a sub-system maintainer easier -- rather than harder.
My employer pays for a commercial bk license.

I don't see why not.  Given your central role to the Linux development
process, I would think it would be trivial to justify OSDL arming you
with any and all tools you desire if they make you even slightly more effective.
Also, I would think Bitmover would be interested in having you enabled
to keep people like me as happy paying customers.
The question for bk use is what do we do for a reference "Linus tree"
history.  It would be most effective if we could have a single bk history
rather than everybody rolling their own.

I can do this if you require it.  The current "acpi patch" includes
68 patches: 200 files changed, 7780 insertions(+), 5455 deletions(-)
Everything in it is intended to go to Linus on day-one of 2.6.13.
Some of it should really go into 2.6.12 - but frankly, I hesitate
to touch 2.6.12 while the tools are in such flux.

Please do not roll -mm without including the ACPI sub-system.
-mm provides the broadest pre-integration test coverage we've ever had.
It has allowed us to significantly reduce regressions in Linus' tree
as we encounter the inevitable setbacks associated with making
the ACPI sub-system in Linux the best in the industry.
