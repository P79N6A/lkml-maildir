Hmmm ..., this is 2.4.27:
[davide@bigblue davide]$ gcc -g -o zzzzzzzz zzzzzzzz.c 
[davide@bigblue davide]$ ./zzzzzzzz

[davide@bigblue davide]$ gdb ./zzzzzzzz

(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/davide/zzzzzzzz 
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x08048454 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbffff9c4) at zzzzzzzz.c:26
26              asm volatile("pushfl ; andl %0,(%%esp) ; popfl"
(gdb) signal SIGTRAP
Continuing with signal SIGTRAP.
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00000003 in ?? ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00000003 in ?? ()
#1  0x0804846b in smc () at zzzzzzzz.c:32
#2  0x46649b7f in __libc_start_main () from /lib/i686/libc.so.6
#3  0x08048359 in _start ()
So it seems it did not work even before, the gdb-SIGTRAP stepping. In 
2.6.8 I get a straight segfault just for running it.
