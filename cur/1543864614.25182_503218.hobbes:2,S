ACK, it's a bug, the patch is there, and AFAIR it's simple and correct. Maybe
it is suitable for the stable branch, too. If the RAW driver isn't removed,
it should be applied.

O_DIRECT on devices is accepted by Linus, since it has much less corner
cases.

It must be hard to add #ifndef O_DIRECT / #define O_DIRECT 0 / #endif
and to add O_DIRECT to the apropiate open calls ...
(I peeked into the driver, and it seems it's just a wrapper creating an alias
 and opening the associated block-device O_DIRECT.)
