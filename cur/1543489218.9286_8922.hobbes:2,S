Subject: NFS client performance 1.5 orders of magnitude too slow?

 Hi,
I have heard that the Linux NFS client doesn't have the best reputation.
However, I really couldn't believe the following results I got.
The following program writes 8,192 bytes, 1 byte at a time.
    #include <fcntl.h>
    void main(int ac, char *av[])
    {
	int fd = open(av[1], O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, 0777);
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 8192; i++) {
	    write(fd, "0", 1);
	}
	close(fd);
    }
From two machines with an identical LAN network connection to a SunOS 5.6
server, the program finishes instantaneously on a FreeBSD 3.0 machine:
time ./tw.f3 A1
0.008u 0.091s 0:00.10 90.0%     5+176k 0+1io 1pf+0w
On a Linux 2.2.3/RH 5.2 machine, however, it takes
time ./tw.linux B1
0.000u 0.840s 0:51.16 1.6%      0+0k 0+0io 64pf+0w
51 seconds!
Please tell me that I'm doing something wrong here.
Here's an excerpt from the tcpdump:
23:50:34.178183 peerless.cs.utah.edu.3079405568 > envy.cs.utah.edu.nfs: 172 writ
e [|nfs]
23:50:34.183063 envy.cs.utah.edu.nfs > peerless.cs.utah.edu.3079405568: reply ok
 96 write [|nfs] (DF)
23:50:34.183136 peerless.cs.utah.edu.3096182784 > envy.cs.utah.edu.nfs: 152 geta
ttr [|nfs]
23:50:34.183647 envy.cs.utah.edu.nfs > peerless.cs.utah.edu.3096182784: reply ok
 96 getattr [|nfs] (DF)
23:50:34.183719 peerless.cs.utah.edu.3112960000 > envy.cs.utah.edu.nfs: 172 writ
e [|nfs]
Linux issues 8,192 writes.
Here's a back of the envelope calculation for the above tcpdump excerpt:
	4880 us between write req & write reply
          73 us between write reply & getattr req
         511 us between getattr req & getattr reply
          72 us between getattr reply & next write req
Makes roughly 5536 us per request, which about adds up to 40-50 seconds
for 8192 requests.
So, I guess I have two questions:
+ Why does Linux do the getattr following the write?
+ Assuming the write takes so long (almost 5 ms) because the server does
  synchronous writes to disk, then the issue is that Linux doesn't aggregate
  write requests?
I assume this is what the README file for nfsserver2.2beta40
means when it says:
   * NFS  operation  between  two  Linux  boxes can be quite
     slow. There are a number of reasons for this, only  one
     of  which  is  that  unfsd runs in user space.  Another
     (and much worse) problem is that the Linux  NFS  client
     code  currently  does no proper caching, read-ahead and
     write-behind of NFS data.  This problem can  be  helped
     by  increasing  the  RPC transfer size on the client by
     adding the `rsize=8192,wsize=8192' mount options.  This
     will  at  least  improve  throughput  when  reading  or
     writing large files.  You  are  still  in  a  lose-lose
     situation  when applications write data line by line or
     with no output buffering at all.
Is anybody working on fixing this situation?  I had heard rumors that
this had finally been fixed in 2.2.x, but apparently it hasn't. 
This seems like a showstopper for Linux to me.  This would be sad
since I rather use Linux than FreeBSD, but I may not be able to
afford the wait when I'm dealing with applications that are unaware
of this problem and don't do their own buffering.
