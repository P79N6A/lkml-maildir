There is no difference.
You had no route to 62.0.0.0/8 before, so that new route becomes active.
That ppp route will become active too after you delete gatewayed one.
Kernel respects the work, which you made manually and never overrides it 8)
To avoid such ambiguity people use usually not zero metric
on gatewayed routes. It is valid way, but I like more to keep
always exactly one route for each destination i.e. to delete
wrong routes.
