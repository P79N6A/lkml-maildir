   Got my two new Netgear GA302t nics today.  They seem to use the
   tg3 driver....
   
   I put them into the 64/66 slots on my Tyan dual amd motherboard..
   Running kernel 2.4.20-pre8
   
You reported the other week problems with two Acenic's in
this same machine right?  The second Acenic wouldn't even probe
properly.  And the two Acenic's were identical.
I see a pattern developing... :-)
