That doesnt seem to be too high. 
You have a dual opteron 244. You are supposed to be kicking ass with
that machine - not 200Kpps+ you are getting with all that CPU overload.
Something is wrong with your setup. Unfortunately i cant afford such a
machine so i cant see it right off the bat. I know Robert has at least
one similar machine; maybe he could help. Robert?
cheers,
