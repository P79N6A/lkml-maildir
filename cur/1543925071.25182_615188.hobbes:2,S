Gene took his question to fedora-selinux-list, which is appropriate
since the autorelabel stuff is distro-specific.
In Fedora, rc.sysinit will perform a relabel if /.autorelabel exists or
autorelabel was passed on the kernel command line.  /.autorelabel can be
created by the user, by rc.sysinit itself (if you boot with SELinux
disabled, to force a relabel if you ever re-enable SELinux later), or by
utilities like system-config-{securitylevel,selinux} in response to
changing settings.  Merely installing and booting a new kernel shouldn't
trigger it.
Even when triggered, a relabel shouldn't call setxattr on the file
unless its existing on-disk label doesn't match the file contexts
specification in policy.  There is a force option that unconditionally
sets the label on all files, but I don't see that being used by the
autorelabel support.
