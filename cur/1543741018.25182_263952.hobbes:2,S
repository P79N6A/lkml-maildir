The reason why st.c calls cdev_alloc() directly is that this allows it to 
use the large minor numbers (some people want to use more than 32 tapes).
This also used to give presence in sysfs but that is not the case any 
more. The devices can be shown in sysfs using device classes (st.c uses 
the class_simple_* functions).
Osst does call cdev_alloc() indirectly through register_chrdev(). This is 
the link between the "old style" character device allocation and the 
current method. As long as register_chrdev() exists, you don't have any 
pressing need to change osst unless you want to support more than 256 
minors.
