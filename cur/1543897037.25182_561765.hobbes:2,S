I tracked the problem halfway down, with 2.6.20-rc1-ubuntu1 [1] it works
and with 2.6.20-rc2-ubuntu2 [2] not.
The diff is here, unfortunately the acpi changes are about 100kb.
http://debian.christian-leber.de/2.2-3.4.patch
(the problem is a bit different, it suspends, when trying to resume it
goes back to suspend and when i try again it's dead)
For some reason that i don't get vanilla 2.6.20-rc1 doesn't boot because
ata_piix doesn't work "PCI: Unable to reserve I/O region...." no remote
idea why it works with the ubuntu kernel.
So i can't bisect it.
