another symptom (don't know if it's actually related) is that if I
try to switch to a virtual consol (ctl-alt-chift-F[1..6] the screen
won't change out of graphics mode - it goes black like it's trying
to switch but comes back with the graphical screen which isn't responsive
and hitting alt-F7 restores it to operation. I just rebooted to a kernel
that doesn't have the RT-preempt patch but uses the same .config and
everything for switching between X and virtual terminals works just fine.
