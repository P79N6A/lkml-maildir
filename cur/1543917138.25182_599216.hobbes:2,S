There are some places in generic code where it makes sense, e.g.:
  #define BUG_ON(condition) do { if (unlikely(condition)) BUG(); } while(0)
If you run into a BUG() it's anyway game over.
And there are some rare hotpaths in the kernel where it might make 
sense, and many other places where the likely/unlikely usage that might 
be present doesn't make sense.
Unless you know you need it you simply shouldn't use likely/unlikely.
