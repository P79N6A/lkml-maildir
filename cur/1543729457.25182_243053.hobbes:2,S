According to Ismail:
* The problem is reproducible.
* SELinux is disabled.
* With the patch the problem occurs.
* With the patch reversed, the problem went away.
Unfortunately, this appears to be mixed up with
another 2.6.8.1-mm1 change causing udev to garble
the creation of /dev/tty and pty devices.
Applying/reversing the controlling-tty patch in isolation
creates/corrects the symptom with the less program,
so there seems to be some relation.
