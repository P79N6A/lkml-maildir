I agree that some messages can be eliminated, but not all of
them. Even some of the ones you suggested might be valuable to keep,
like the CPU flags. Generally this isn't a problem on a small box with
2 CPUs and 2 disks, but if you have 32 CPUs and 64 SCSI disks, the
amount of data being printed becomes quite substantial.
So while I agree that it wouldn't hurt for us to eliminate some
unncessary printk's, then I still think Martin's patch has a lot of
merit.
Cheers,
Jes
