Hello!

It is worth to note, that it never was used. 8)
Certainly, it is not used in 2.2 too.

These flags reflect not your personal preference, but physical
media characteristics. Ethernet is broadcast, even only two hosts
sit on wire, ppp is pointopoint by defintion.
BTW these flags were/are absolutely not essential, when choosing routes
to destination.

Neither this, not this. Metric on routes is real solution with existing
software. But it is not desired. Kernel is not appropriate place
to store information, which it need not.

ip route add 10.3.3.0/24 dev dummy metric 20
Probably, you have some old version of iproute2.

It is really interesting! What ifconfig ippp0 and ip addr ls dev ippp0
show?
