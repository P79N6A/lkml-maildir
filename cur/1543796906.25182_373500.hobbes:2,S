Dick, be nice.  I get the impression that Vinay is just looking at some
code that he can't disclose because of some policy of the company he
works for.  He's curiously looking at the code of some non-mainstream
driver (either GPL or some NDA version) and is questioning what he sees.
Not everyone that does this is a kernel hacker.  This is the way I
started, and these questions, which may seem so obvious to a veteran
kernel hacker, is not so to a novice.
