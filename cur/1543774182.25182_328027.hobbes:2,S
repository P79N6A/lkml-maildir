Thanks, I'll try it.

We don't need them at the same time:
* Usually, the system boots from flash, 
  and the CF is used for data transfer 
  (and hence should be changeable).
* In case of emergency (when the system in flash got messed up), 
  or for the first-time flash,
  it would be nice to be able to boot from CF.
  In that case, the CF will not be removed in flight!
