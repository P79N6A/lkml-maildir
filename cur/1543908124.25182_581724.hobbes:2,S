We make plenty of practical assumptions in the kernel, and declare incorrect 
things which violate them, even in cases where there's no commandment from the 
heavens forbidding them.  Since the whole point of this exercise is to prevent 
badness with *optimizing* compilers, it's quite reasonable to declare broken any 
so-called optimizer which violates these trivial assumptions.

If something breaks because of this, it was already broken, but hidden a lot 
better.  I don't see much of a downside to exposing and fixing those bugs.
