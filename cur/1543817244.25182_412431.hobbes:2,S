Yeah, that's probably best to start with. If 'gift' copies become
widely used and performance critical we can look at tricks to speed
it up further (not that this way would be particularly slow itself).
My first thought is that falling back to copying would be the best
idea, because otherwise you can get random failures for any number of
reasons (dirty pages, page reclaim, migration, get_user_pages, etc).
If a future usage wants an error, we could add an extra flag?

Sure, I wouldn't get around to it for a while yet anyway, but I'd be
happy to review your patch if you do it earlier.
