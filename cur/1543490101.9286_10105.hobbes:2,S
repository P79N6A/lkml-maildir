    I noticed that when I installed the 2.2.x kernels
    that all of my msdos mounts were broken, and fs
    type "msdos" was unrecognized.  Was "msdos" fs
    support dropped?  Was this a config error?  I
    can still use vfat and umsdos fs's.
    I haven't found anything about this in any of the 2.2
    docs.
(i) If you really use a FAT filesystem, stay with 2.0.36 or so.
So far, FAT is seriously broken under 2.2.*.
(ii) In case you installed a very recent util-linux (like 2.9m)
then the autodetect will detect vfat when something looks like
msdos/vfat/umsdos.
[Many people have asked for this - I must have gotten at least
twenty patches implementing this - finally let me be convinced
by the argument that only "mount -t type device dir" is required
to be correct, and that anybody who omits "-t type" gets what she
asks for: a heuristic.]
So, in case you depended on the old behaviour of the heuristic,
things may be a bit different today. When sufficiently many people
complain I will go back to the previous state of affairs where we
only guessed when there was really good evidence for a particular fs.
