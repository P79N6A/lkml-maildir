The emulated rawmode unfortunately cannot cover every keyboard out
there, because of the limitations of the PS/2 protocol, which only can
transfer about 240 different scancodes.
The event interface of course doesn't have this limitation.

The kernel input layer doesn't treat modifiers as special keys, and
currently (include/linux/input.h) has shift, alt, ctrl and meta keys.
Both left and right.  This covers all keyboards I've seen so far,
including SGI, Sun, Mac, and other keyboards.
This is different from the X keysym modifiers, because the super and
hyper modifiers usually don't correspond to real physical keys on the
keyboard.

include/linux/input.h has the documented set of keycodes. It's largely
based on what 2.4 uses for keycodes - sanitized PS/2 codes.

The emulated scancodes are not documented at the moment, but you can
find out a scancode for a documented keycode by looking at
drivers/char/keyboard.c, which has a mapping table in it.

It was written for 2.4 unfortunately, and 2.6's emulated rawmode
confuses it no end.

Not really. There is a method that's almost straightforward. Press the
key, type 'dmesg', and you'll see two lines suggesting the setkeycodes
command. There you get the first parameter - scancode. Then you look up
the key in include/linux/input.h, and there you find the keycode.
And then you use the command.
After that, you have the kernel acquainted with your keyboard. You can
verify with evtest (attached), that the kernel understands every key on
your keyboard correctly.
Next is X.
For X, you use showkey -s, and record the scancodes the kernel
generates. These will be the same on every machine. Then you modify xkb
to understand them.
The X step could be avoided if we had a definition file for xkb for the
kernel emulated keyboard.

It turns out it's not as easy as it seems to be. But I'll hopefully have
something finished today.
