Hrrm, well, I'm in the middle of deploying AFS (moving away from NFS), and 
one of the ideas I toyed with was how to get a diskless AFS client. (yeah, 
that sounds silly at first, 2GB disks used to be large, not systems with 
2GB of ram are common.) A mostly kernel-based implementation of AFS would 
be quite usefull for this. (and the remaining bits could be in an 
initramfs)
