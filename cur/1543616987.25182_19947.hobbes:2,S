O.k. That sounds about like what I was expecting.

But for make -j the forking is done by make and it is nearly a
fork bomb, there is simply a linear increase in the number of processes
instead of an exponential one.  So I will at least hold this as a candidate
for the make -j kernel fixes.

Which is definitely a win.  Perhaps we could even have paged page tables
at that point.
There is a second piece that should make things faster as well.  Adopt
the a BSD style page table allocation where we do an order 1 allocation
and allocate both the page table and the reverse page tables all in the same
chunk of memory.  Which means you can jump from one to the other with pointer
arithmetic.  So you can lose one element of your reverse page table chain
structure.
