That depends on what you mean exactly... user space might have some trouble
receiving information; sending has never been a problem.  In kernel space,
this is out-right simple :-)

That was Scott Bork's college project from many years ago.  Of course it was
freakin' slow... it was designed for an Adaptec 1542.
I have a complete mirror of it (what used to be

) if anyone wants me to put it back on the
net somewhere.

Writeablity would be very desirable!  How much does Digital sell their SCSI
