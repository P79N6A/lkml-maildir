Sam,
in early September, you indicated in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112603854721991&w=2
that the change from Andreas Gruenbacher to use $(objtree) on certain
include references in the makefiles was already in Linus' tree. Now,
looking more closely at the changes 2.6.14 made, I find that none of
those prefixes aren't there. Thus I wonder - did you add something (that
escapes me) that makes this prefixing unnecessary, or was the patch
later dropped for some reason?
Thanks, Jan
