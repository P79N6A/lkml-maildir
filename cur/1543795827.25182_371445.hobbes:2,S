It's only that slow if the hardware can't do better.
And the kernel makes it only slow when using RDTSC directly
is unsafe - so if you use it directly thinking the kernel cheats
you for your cycles you're just shoting yourself in the own foot.

If you have capable hardware it can already do much better.
