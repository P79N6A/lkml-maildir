Indeed this may not be something where Infinite Diversity in
Infinite Combinations is a good thing.
The best way to make sure everything works ok, is to draw out the
specs for a policy and ensure it, but maybe it can't be enforced
in the kernel.
Unless the policy defined which directories (disregard the irony,
please :) in the meta structure are available and off limits for
mkdir et al.
Sure this may be circumvented still by setting up an xml schema
somewhere and so on and so forth.
So my best guess probably is to have LSB extended with a damned
good policy about How Things Work(tm) with the new meta system.
