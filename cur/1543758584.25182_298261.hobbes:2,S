Hi!
Since 2.6.10, unbacked shared memory allocated via shmget is not
included in core dumps. The relevant patch has been done to binfmt_elf.c
after the discussion to "include all vmas with unbacked pages in ELF
core dumps", here:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0410.2/1890.html
The result was:
static int maydump(struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
	/* Do not dump I/O mapped devices, shared memory, or special mappings */
	if (vma->vm_flags & (VM_IO | VM_SHARED | VM_RESERVED))
		return 0;
...
I consider this a bug, since we clearly lose unbacked shared memory in
the process.
bye
