And I was right last time too :-)

__u16 is no more a kernel type than uint16_t.
It is a one line fix: include <linux/types.h> instead of <asm/types.h>
Which you probably should be doing anyway, since there is no
reason to rely on any assembler types in <linux/input.h>

So do I, and it had better be a standard type.
Note that the input API does *NOT* use __u* extensively. In fact
if you take out the force feedback stuff (which Johannes already
agreed to change:), this is the *only* _u* usage in any part of the 
input API.

I am doing it all. Johannes agreed to the change, and I did the only
other required entry. If Johannes agrees, I'll do the trivial changes
for force-feedback.
The reason why I am not doing it all at once is to provide patches
that do one API change at a time. Or, depending on how you look
at it, I did the only change all-at-once, and you reverted it :)
