I admited that Alexander's point is valid. But I don't think
request_module() should work around that - it is better to document module
names containing % character as invalid. A non-privileged user can't do
anything nasty here so I don't see any problem. Let's document it in some
obscure place so the luser (or lprogrammer?) who wrote a module called
"h%ell%o" spends hours finding out why it is not autoloaded... ;)

Tigran.
