"Energy" and "charge", please.  You cannot store "current", it is an unit
used to measure flows.  Anyway, we are just repeating arguments that were
made already in the battery thread...
And, please let's follow the SBS spec naming if possible for the attributes.
They put a lot of thought on the way they named things.  Again, this is
already in the battery thread...

Indeed, battery_capacity:mWh and battery_capacity:mAh would work just fine
and it does look better.  But unless Greg changes his mind, it looks like we
shall do without units in the filenames, which will also work just fine, if
small enough units are choosen...
