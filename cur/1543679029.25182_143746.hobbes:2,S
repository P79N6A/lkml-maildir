These are good news, indeed. The patch is getting better and better, but
I'm still seeing XMMS audio skips when clicking on a URL inside
Evolution (and using Konqueror as my web browser), and sometimes when
moving windows around.
Also, it seems that nicing the X server to -20 causes it to get CPU at
discontinuous bursts, causing window movement to be somewhat jerky. The
overall feeling for the X server is better at a default nice of 0. Isn't
this curious?
