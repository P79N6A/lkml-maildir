    Sure.  But you'll need to write the code and get it past the wall of
    flame to demonstrate it first.   I think (looking from a 10-year
    distance from when I last hacked filesystems) that it would be
    moderately straightforward to make the code changes for at least
    ext2;  you'd simply have to tweak acl.c (in 2.0.28+logo; dunno
    where it lives in other kernels) so that ext2_permission wouldn't
    puke out when the inode is S_ISLNK.
    But, wall of flame aside, consider that it might not be as useful as
    you'd want, since it would be about as barkingly nonportable as you
    can buy without a prescription.   At best (it being a wonderful idea
    just waiting for someone to take down that wall of Standards(tm))
    its going to be a Linux-specific thing for at least 5 years (1 year
    to put it into all of the other Unices, 4 years to push out the
    Unices that don't support it), and at worst (devfs) it will do
    nothing except call down all the friendly fire you can eat.

    I don't think it would require any new system call, just:
