Do it in boot/setup.S so that you can still issue a message via the
BIOS.  However, don't forget you might need bug fixes/workarounds like
the P6 SEP in there, too.  From that perspective it would be nice to
have something that can be written in C.  Recent binutils actually
allow gcc-generated .s-files to be assembled for a 16-bit environment
(with lots of overrides.)
