Subject: [2.6.8.1] Can't activate ISA PnP modem

I can't activate my modem under this kernel.  Neither
        cat auto >/sys/bus/pnp/devices/.../resources
nor cat ... dynamic.  And it insn't activated at the start time, of
course.  After cat auto >resources the file contains state=disabled
and _correctly_ assigned IO ranges and IRQ.  Modem is USR Courier.
What all these mean?
Thanks in advance.
