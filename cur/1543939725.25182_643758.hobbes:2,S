If people started filtering by stefanr to follow IEEE 1394 subsystem
development, I would have to stop drawing myself into SCSI/ Kconfig menu
layout/ coding style related discussions and meta discussions such as
this.  Which might actually be a good move anyway.  :-)

Well, bisectability issues apparently occur primarily in the merge
result after merges of cross-subsystem changes.  So, things like the new
pre-merge tree which James Bottomley set up might actually help with
this issue.
