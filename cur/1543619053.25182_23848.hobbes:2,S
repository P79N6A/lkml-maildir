Things like this would be fixed by having a kmap variant
which maps the pages into process-private space, kind of
like kmap_atomic(), but into a (4 MB sized?) part of
address space which is only visible within this process.
This would mean that each process can have a few MB of
kmap()d pages ... should be nice for things like having
copy_{to,from}_user "cache" the hot pages while keeping
longer term mappings from filling the global pool.

Rik
