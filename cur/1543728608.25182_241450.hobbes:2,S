I said I'd never seen this (true), but it could happen if you were 
burning an audio CD using the ide-scsi or ATA: interface. In 2.6 the 
ATAPI: interface uses DMA. I don't know what the program does if you 
just say dev=/dev/hdx, I don't normally use it that way (I got into the 
habit of using ATAPI:). Given a fast burner and the interface using PIO, 
I guess you could slow the system down some!
