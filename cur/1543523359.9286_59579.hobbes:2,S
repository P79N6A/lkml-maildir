Oleg,
Can you try the driver available at
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/8139too/
 and let me know how well it
works?
It is a heavily modified version of Donald Becker's driver, and I
believe that it solves some of the problems associated with SMP.
any feedback on the performance of this driver is welcomes, as well.
Regards,
	Jeff
