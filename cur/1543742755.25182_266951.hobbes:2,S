i got a deadlock though. it was a weird one. mouse and keyboard [including
sysrq] froze. but the find / i started kept on running in an xterm. had to
press reset due to lack of second machine..
flo
p.s. new rtc_wakeup version uploaded, which shows the percentage converted
to usecs (always positive, you need the sign?). btw: with V0.6.2 i sometimes
see jitter > 100% but still no lost irq (/dev/rtc still reports only 1
delivered irq on next wakeup). I cannot provke lost irqs with -f up to 2048.
With -f 8192 i do get lost irq's [not amazing though].
