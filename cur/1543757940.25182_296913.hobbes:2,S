Jeff, please apply:
Here's a big stack of patches that make a significant step forward on
the long overdue orinoco driver merge.  Still quite a long way to go,
but it's something.  This patch stack is againt Linus' vanilla +
Viro's big iomap cleanup patch, as requested.
The first 9 patches make only trivial or cosmetic behavioural changes:
	1/14		orinoco-carrier 
		Use netif_carrier_*() macros instead of homegrown
		'connected' variable.
	2/14		orinoco-printks 
		Update various printk()s and other cosmetic strings
	3/14		orinoco-delays
		Use mdelay() and ssleep() instead of outdated ways of
		delaying.
	4/14		orinoco-free-orinocodev
		Introduce free_orinocodev() function, to reduce noise
		in future diffs.
	5/14		orinoco-cleanup-hermes
		Assorted cleanups to low-level hardware access code
	6/14		orinoco-pci-updates
		Cleanup to initialization code for the PCI based
		orinoco devices.
	7/14		orinoco-modparm
		Use modern module_parm macros for orinoco module.
	8/14		orinoco-pccard-cleanups
		Cleanup to PCMCIA initialization code
	9/14		orinoco-void-ethersnap
		Trivial change to is_ethersnap() function to reduce
		future diff noise.
The next 4 patches start to intoduce real new functionality and
bug fixes:
	10/14		orinoco-no-ibss-any
		Disallow IBSS mode if no ESSID is set (too many
		firmwares break, otherwise)
	11/14		orinoco-late-tx-wake
		Delay waking the Tx queue, fixes problems on a number
		of firwmares
	12/14		orinoco-wep-updates
		Various updates to WEP setup code
	13/14		orinoco-update-firmware-detection
		Updates and bugfixes to firmware detection logic
And the final one, is another trivial one:
	14/14		orinoco-is-now-0.14alpha2
		Update version and changelog to reflect the above
		patches.
