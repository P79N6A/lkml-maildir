   I think there's something wrong with this analysis. That bit isn't
   appearing out of thin air, it's coming out of the pool. If the attacker
   knew all the inputs to the pool, he'd know that bit as well. So this is
   zero new bits. Otherwise, we could recursively generate arbitrary amounts
   of entropy by calling the PRNG!
I believe Andi was positing the existence of a separate PRNG, and my
point was that if you are afraid the adversary knows the interrupt
stream timing perfectly, the only additional "entropy" which is added
comes from the PRNG.  Of course, the PRNG can be at most
cryptographically strong, which means that it's not really contributing
any entropy..... which was my point.
