No, the APIC errors also occur at exactly 100MHz.
Unfortunately, my MoBo does not offer 95MHz, so I'm running 75MHz now :-(
Reading APIC specs and errata now. 
The funny thing is that the errors occur on the APIC bus, which runs
independently @ 33MHz, no matter if the FSB is 66 or 100 MHz, if I
understand the docs well. Maybe some timing stuff at the local APICs ...
