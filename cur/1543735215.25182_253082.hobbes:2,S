drivers/char/Kconfig:
config HPET_MMAP
        bool "Allow mmap of HPET"
        default y
        depends on HPET
        help 
          If you say Y here, user applications will be able to mmap
          the HPET registers.
          In some hardware implementations, the page containing HPET
          registers may also contain other things that shouldn't be
          exposed to the user.  If this applies to your hardware,
          say N here.
