There is no doubt, the idx variable is used on the very next line,
it's address is being passed to bvec_alloc_bs() which as the very
first thing it does fills in a value or returns NULL (in which case
idx is undefined anyway).
So there's no doubt at all that idx will always get a value assigned to it.
gcc is right to warn in the sense that it doesn't know if
bvec_alloc_bs() will read or write into idx when its address is passed
to it. But since we know that bvec_alloc_bs() only reads from it after
having assigned a value we know that gcc's warning is wrong, idx can
never *actually* be used uninitialized.
