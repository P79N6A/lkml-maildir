Whilst in general, I'd agree, in this case it makes no sense - there are
two masks set: the irqbalance mask, and the apicid mask. If irqbalance
is on, setting the apicid mask doesn't really do anything, because 
irqbalance is going to reset it dynamically very shortly afterwards
anyway. It's hard to imagine how that might be useful ;-)
It might conceivably be useful to disable irqbalance dynamically, if that's
what you mean, but that shouldn't be the default behaviour, I think. 
Keith already a nice simple patch to make it a config option ... doing it 
dynamically is a different project, IMHO, and one of questionable utility 
to anyone not capable of coding it themselves ;-)
