Searching through archives founded problems respect to CUV4X-* mainboards
booting 2.4.x kernels. The messages I did found are about mid 2001, where 2.4.3
was in the throne.
I have an Asus CUV4X board, my linux crash while booting, tested with 2.4.19 and
2.4.20-pre8. Taking the advise from those all messages I booted with 'noapic'
but then my second NIC wheren't not correctly. initialized.
I think although noapic "ensures" booting, probably introduces later problems.

Patience is likely to be effective. The chipset isn't exactly rare
being on SMP boards from Gigabyte, MSI, Tyan and Asus, and likely
others. I'm betting it will be fixed soon enough. UP and 2.2.x
kernels worked fine here if you're really desperate. OTOH, the
board is stable once you get past the boot problems... What sort
of production system needs frequent unattended boots?
Sorry about this, I just don't remember signing any paychecks for
what I know is likely to be a non-issue probably before the next
time I actually have to do something drastic, like reboo

I would like to know if anyone is enduring this problem and if it's currently
addressed on -ac tree.
My system (Asus CUV4X, 2.4.19 or 2.4.20-pre8, UP P3 600MHz)
