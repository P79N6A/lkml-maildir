Yes, I know.

Well, oom-killer can, since it drops unkillable state from the process
mask, that may be not enough though, but it tries more than userspace.
My main point was to haev a way to monitor memory usage and that any
process could tune own behaviour according to that information. Which is
not realated to the system oom-killer at all. Thus /dev/mem_notify is
interested first (and only the first) as a memory usage notification
interface and not a way to invoke any kind of 'soft' oom-killer.
Application can do whatever it wants of course including killing itself
or the neighbours, but this should not be forced as a usage policy.
