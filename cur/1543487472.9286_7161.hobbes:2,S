This is a know bug with some BIOS implementations.  They assume that
we will switch back to real mode before we ask them to power off.
Under Linux we do not do this.
[I am assuming the emssages you get start with something like
OOPS: ... f000
]
Complain to Gigabyte.
Alternatively, someone could write me some code that (reliably) switches
to real mode and we could call that in the power off code ...
