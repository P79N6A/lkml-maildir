While I understand that you're frustrated, please direct it towards
your vendor who is unwilling to open up the hardware documentation.
The binary-only drivers you are using are not supported on Linux (you
took them from Windows, remember) and the only way you're ever going
to get reliable wireless support is by reverse engineering or vendor
opening up the specs.
