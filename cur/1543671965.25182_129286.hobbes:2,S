First off, could you take a look at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608
I thought it was an sr problem, but it doesn't seem to show up on
anything other than adaptec controllers?  Thanks.

The changes for this:
+#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,0)
+#define        AIC_LINUX_IRQRETURN_T irqreturn_t
+#define        AIC_LINUX_IRQRETURN(ours) return (IRQ_RETVAL(ours))
+#else
+#define        AIC_LINUX_IRQRETURN_T void
+#define        AIC_LINUX_IRQRETURN(ours)  return
+#endif
Are rather convoluted.  Could you just remove the wrappering for 2.5?

-ahc_linux_select_queue_depth(struct Scsi_Host * host,
-                            Scsi_Device * scsi_devs)
+ahc_linux_select_queue_depth(struct Scsi_Host *host, Scsi_Device
*scsi_devs)
select_queue_depth isn't a 2.5 interface anymore, why do you even still
need it?

This is entirely irrelevant to 2.5 as well.
