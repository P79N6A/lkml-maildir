I'm wondering if the above is a processor-specific bug...
I have two systems with IDENTICAL motherboards, hard drives, etc,
which differ ONLY in the processor - one has an Intel P266, the other
an AMD K6-2/350, and the latter is showing this problem where the
former isn't - and the CMOS settings are identical in all other
respects...
Don't ask me what's going on, but I have to suspect something here...
Best wishes from Riley.
