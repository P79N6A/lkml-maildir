Ok. So this is the cause. The driver gets a '0xfe' response, which means
"error, command not supported, or device not present'.
A keyboard must support the 0xf5 command ('reset').
So, the error response might be coming either from the mouse, or the
controller, and somehow gets passed to the keyboard (they unfortunately
share the same registers), or the response somes from the mouse driver
first trying to probe for a mouse on the port.
So, please #define I8042_DEBUG_IO in drivers/input/serio/i8042.h as
well, and try again. Then we'll know more.

Very intersting. It works for me on my via82c686b.
