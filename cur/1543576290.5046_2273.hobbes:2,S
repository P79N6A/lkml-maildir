Yes, it complains. But BIOS correctly reports x1/x2 depending on
number of CPUs I plug into motherboard, so I believe that it did
some initialization before it start loading OS.
calibrating APIC timer ...
..... CPU clock speed is 797.0452 MHz.
..... host bus clock speed is 99.6305 MHz.

checking TSC synchronization across CPUs: passed.
Setting commenced=1, go go go
mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent variable MTRR settings
mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs
