Your mail client isnt wrapping lines btw which is the only rule you 
might possibly have broken.
2.4.19 has pretty close to current MPT fusion drivers. LSI provide
regular updates that go into the -ac tree and then rapidly onto Marcelo
so the controllers are very well supported by the vendor (nice hardware
too)
If you need the specific drivers they are GPL code, so ask SuSE where
the source is.
