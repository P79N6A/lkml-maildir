It's always shared mappings, isn't it?  :-)
Virtual memory access to the file is even easier, though.  A write in
progress is an individual store to virtual memory.  The only way you could
even see it is if a page fault is in progress.  So the most you would need
to wait for in going into the hard "read only" state I defined is for any
page I/O to complete.  And for the "no new writes" state, you just write
protect all the pages (and any new ones that fault in too).
