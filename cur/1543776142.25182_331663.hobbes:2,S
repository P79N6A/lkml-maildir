GFP allocs may not do the right thing. If you want to do this then it 
may be best to set the memory policy to restrict allocations to the node 
on which the device resides.
Plus there are CPU less nodes. What happens to those?

No just patch those that would benefit from it. The existing 
dma_alloc_coherent already takes care of many of the placement 
issues for driver memory. We would probably need to patch more locations 
where higher level control structure allocations are being done.

Definitely.
