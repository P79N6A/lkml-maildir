It avoids one load from memory when allocating and the release is simply 
writing the page->flags back. Less instructions.

I thought you agreed that release semantics only require a write barrier? 
The issue here is that other processors see the updates before the 
updates to page-flags.
A load leaking out of a critical section would require that the result of 
the load is not used to update other information before the slab_unlock 
and that the source of the load is not overwritten in the critical 
section. That does not happen in sluib.
