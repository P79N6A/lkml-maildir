You never know what your fellow employees will do...  Where there is a 
will there is a way.
If you don't think it got rooted, what did you or other employees do 
recently on that machine that would cause software to be changed?  Did 
anybody do any upgrades?  Unless you can confirm an alternate 
explanation then I'd assume it was rooted.  If the machine was upgraded 
by downloading from the net, was the site you downloaded from secure? 
Just because a machine is behind many fire walls doesn't mean that it 
can't be rooted.
