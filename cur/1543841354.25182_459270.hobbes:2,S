Adrian, Roman,
both the comment hack and the 'select' hack introduce redundancy into 
the Kconfig files and add maintenance cost. In addition, 'select' 
currently brings a danger of inconsistent configuration. As I said 
before, the proper solution would be enhancements to the "make 
XYZconfig" UIs to comfortably present unfulfilled dependencies, based on 
'depends on' alone. Alas my posting here is yet another one without a 
patch included...
