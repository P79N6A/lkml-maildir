It cannot be taken any later. NTFS is a database both in memory and on disk 
and in fact the in memory meta data is the on-disk structures (i.e. no 
conversion between the two is performed, except in few speed optimization 
cases and in cases where meta data is compressed on disk).
Because everything is ogranized in database records, I need to grab the 
lock as soon as I intend to access the record (in fact the lock itself is 
taken by map_mft_record(READ or WRITE) which returns a locked record, that 
is mapped and pinned in memory, to the caller. I can then do all sorts of 
things with the record, like search it, parse data from it, etc. When 
finished I unmap_mft_record(READ or WRITE) which undoes everything 
map_mft_record() did, i.e. unpins the record, unmaps it and releases the lock.
All transactions with the on disk storage are done via the page cache and 
read_cache_page() using a special readpage() and a special async io 
completion handler.
Because of the abstraction of access layers it is undesirable to operate on 
the same locks in different layers, hence the top most layer is the one 
locking and unlocking the records. The lower layers don't even know the 
locks exist. Also pushing the lock deep into the layers is not actually 
possible as it would probably need to be taken in reac_cache_page() (the 
only place where the code knows if the page is present in memory or not and 
a disk access is required) which is a VFS/MM function and hence that is not 
an option.
Further, I may need to allocate memory in order to store decompressed 
metadata for example but I won't know if I need to do that until I have 
already locked the record and accessed it to determine if the metadata is 
compressed or not.
So basically I can only obtain sufficient info for deciding what lock I 
need after I have already accessed parts of the record, but to access it I 
need to have locked it. Chicken and egg situation... So the locks are 
always semaphores and are taken in the top layer.
A combi lock would allow spinning in the case where it turns out the code 
paths will not hit disk or sleep in kmalloc, etc and sleeping in the 
disk/kmalloc hit case.
(Yes I know atomic kmalloc exists but I actually need vmalloc in some cases 
depending how much memory I need to handle the metadata...)
Best regards,
Anton
