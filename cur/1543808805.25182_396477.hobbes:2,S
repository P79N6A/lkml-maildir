How does $OS know the storage device wasn't plugged into another system
during that second and changed in that time? This doesn't even seem
far-fetched, just think of USB-capable KVM switches.
Changing st_dev and returning I/O error or stale FS error or whatever is
adequate makes perfect sense. Once the device is unplugged, the mount is
dead. st_dev stability (that is not demanded by POSIX) doesn't help a
iota in making it usable again.
You're barking up the wrong tree anyways. You're holding on to a
non-workable b,t,l approach because it's convenient on BSD and some
other systems, but it cannot be stable. The only stable identifiers I
conceive are brand,model,serial - and this is the way to get rid of the
ugly race between cdrecord -scanbus and cdrecord dev=b,t,l.
Yes, it requires you to change the interface. It doesn't even matter you
need to do that, because hotplug was probably not an issue when libscg
saw the first light on SunOS. Changes in the environment require some
lifeforms to adjust to the new conditions. If they don't change, they'll
die out. This is just natural.
And to make the brand,model,serial approach bullet-proof, the kernel
should detect if this triple is duplicated at some time and refuse to
talk to ANY of these until all but one have been unplugged, just in case
no serial number is provided by a particular device of which two
specimen are plugged.
