I'm glad you're getting bug reports :)  I tore my box completely apart
and put it back together again trying to find what _I_ broke. I took a
crack at fixing it afterward, but nothing came out.. except smoke :-/
WRT kdb: it works great, but there needs to be a better way of linking
in it's symbol table.  I'm currently (2.3.13+ikd+kbd) up to 320k of
reserved space in vmlinux.lds.S and ~21000 symbols in System.map. Soon,
I'll hit the magic 1M barrier.
I wonder if it would be possible to read them into a preallocated
array (steal at boot time like memleak does) instead of linking.
	Cheers,
