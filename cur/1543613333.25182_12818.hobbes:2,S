   I've already asked Linus about that and he told me that he is giving
   higher priority to core changes now and wants to do the merges later... 
That is going to be a lot to accumulate whenever the code change
priority goes back down, really.
To me it makes more sense to do a release or two making one of the
core changes, and fixing it up, then do a sync pass to get the bug
fixes piling up in 2.4.x
I think Linus's scheme is going to result in either a lot of missed
fixes or a lot of unnecessary work and headaches for some poor
person. :-)
