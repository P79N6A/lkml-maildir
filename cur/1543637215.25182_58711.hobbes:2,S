All these mailing lists are used to have kind of a "virtual" team,
are they? If we move the linux/alpha discussions away from
linux-kernel and/or vger.kernel.org how big is the risk that we
solve problems in this list others have already done?
In my oppinion linux/alpha should not be treated as a separate
task, offline from other kernel discussions. Too much information
could get lost - and as we can see now - linux/alpha is way
behind the current tree Linus maintains.
If Linus will participate in a linux/alpha mailing list, then it would
be a good idea - If not ... (guess if he will ;-}).

Martin
