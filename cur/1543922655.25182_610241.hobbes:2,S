hi, list
  I've upgraded my kernel from 2.6.22.9 to 2.6.23 when it was out, After that 
I can't install ELDK 4.1 anymore (The one I installed was crashed), it always 
stopped at preparing install package XXX (or YYY sometimes), I've waited for 
a very long time(more than 1 hour), but it still the same. After I switch 
back to kernel 2.6.22.9, everything is fine. Is there somebody have the some 
problem like me?
  I've tried on two machines:
1. AMD DURON 1.6G, 512M RAM, gentoo 2007.0
2. INTEL Pentium 3 667M, 192M RAM, gentoo 2007.0
  Regards,
Wang
