Hi Luis,
Please pipe the oops messages through ksymoops (check 
linux/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt on how to do so), as they're really 
not useful as is. Also, you may want to check 2.4.20-rc1, quite a few ext3 
fixes went in during the .20-pre series. I seem to remember some bugs in 
transaction.c:226 during 2.4.18/.19-pre...
Also, it would help a great deal if you could reproduce the crash without 
any proprietary modules ever being loaded -- your kernel was marked as 
"tainted", although all modules from the list you provide below should be 
ok (GPL or Dual BSD/GPL). Did you have any nVidia binary only drivers 
loaded at the the time of the crash?
Cheers,
		Nuno
