We are happy to announce that our book is now in stock at various book
stores.  The title of the book is:
	 ia-64 linux kernel: design and implementation
As the title suggests, the book focuses on describing how the Linux
kernel works on the IA-64 architecture (aka, "Itanium Processor
Family" or "IPF").  The book also describes the hardware abstraction
interface of Linux and as such could be of interest to kernel
developers using other platforms.
