No, keventd is properly per-cpu, but the task which is calling
current_is_keventd() is a normal user task, so smp_processor_id()
did warn about it.  It wouldn't make much sense to have a function
current_is_keventd() if you could only call it from a keventd, would
it ;-?  Take a look at it (kernel/workqueue.c), I believe what it does
is unusual (hence that comment about being "preempt-safe") but valid.
