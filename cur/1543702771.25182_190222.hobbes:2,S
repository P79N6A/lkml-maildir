I have long wondered what is so evil about most interrupts going to
CPU 0 that we felt we had to have a pair of irqdaemons in 2.6.  From my
(admittedly imperfect) experience, the APIC will route an interrupt to
CPU 1 if CPU 0 is busy with another interrupt, to CPU 2 if 0 and 1 are
so occupied, and so on.  I see no harm in this other than the strangely
lopsided /proc/interrupt displays, which I can live with.
Earlier APICs had a variation where the search for where each new
interrupt was to go started with first cpu after the one that got the
last interrupt.  If we call this 'round-robin' allocation, then today's
technique could be described as 'first fit'.
If I am wrong about this, I would dearly love to be corrected :)
