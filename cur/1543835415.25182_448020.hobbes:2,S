Just to let you know, I did a cvs checkout of xfs-cmds
as described on 
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/source.html
Then I saved the patch from
http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2006-07/msg00374.html
 using the
"Original" link on hat page.
I build a xfs_Repair binary using that, transferred it onto an old
KLAX boot cd I had and repaired the XFS root on my laptop.
I got 5000 files in lost and found, mostly the whole manpages from my
system. Had to reinstall a few packages to restore lost binaries, but
that's all.
When will that horrible bug be fixed in 2.6.x?
