Besides, some SAN Storage Devices do have that amount of Ram. However it is
better protected as in your typical PC. With Mirroring, it can be removed
(including the battery packs) - and there is a procedure to actually replay
the buffers once the new devices are in place.
But thats not an argument against or in favor of Ramback, its just two
different things. You would be suprised how many databases run on write back
mode disks without fdsync() any nobody cares :)
