Thanks for letting me know.. I had a image of EPOX being pretty good with 
motherboards.. Guess not then.

Why isn't this patch in the mainstream kernel? There are many other 
chipset/bios fixes in the kernel.. This would save many 
reboot/recompilings/worries until or if ever epox does something with the 
bios.
The patch works nicely. Though I did apply it manually to -test3 :) But it 
works.
