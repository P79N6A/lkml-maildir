After much naval-gazing and some prodding from Rusty, I decided to catch up to 
Linus again.
So, the user-mode port of 2.3.28 is available from 
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/karaya/uml/uml.html.
  Aside from the update, not 
much is visibly new.  I fixed some bugs, including a nasty one involving bash 
longjumping out of a signal handler, and cleaned up the code quite a bit.
