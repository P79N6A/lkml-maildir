No, you're passing this to __raw_read/write, so it needs to be
void __iomem *, not u32.  If there's another patch doing that it
needs to be combined with this one.  The miniscule details of
fixes upon fixes aren't interesting for submission purposes, and
just adds extra unnecessary review load for upstream people.
Ditto for anything else which is passed to __raw_read/write*.
