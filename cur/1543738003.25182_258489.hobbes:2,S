Hi,
Followings are patches for removing bitmaps from buddy allocator, against 2.6.9-rc3.
I think this version is much clearer than ones I posted a month ago.
The problem I was worried about was how to deal with memmap's holes in a zone.
and I decided to use pfn_valid() simply. Now, there is no messy codes :)
pfn_valid() is used when macro "HOLES_IN_ZONE" is defined.
It is defined only in ia64 now.
Here is kernbench result on my tiger4 (Itanium2 1.3GHz x2, 8 Gbytes memory)
Average Optimal -j 8 Load Run (Perfroming 5 run of make -j 8 on linux-2.6.8 source tree):
                Elapsed Time  User Time  System Time Percent CPU  Context Switches   Sleeps
2.6.9-rc3         699.906      1322.01     39.336       194            64390         74416.8
no-bitmap         698.334      1321.79     38.58        194.2          64435.4       74622.2
If there is unclear point, please tell me.
Thanks.

=== patch for include files ===
This patch removes bitmap from zone->free_area[] in include/linux/mmzone.h,
and adds some comments on page->private field in include/linux/mm.h.
non-atomic ops for changing PG_private bit is added in include/page-flags.h.
zone->lock is always acquired when PG_private of "a free page" is changed.
