That's something that should be done by constraints - add a new flag
that can be set.

Given the model the API has of not doing anything unless explicitly
told to I'd not expect to see this as a Kconfig option but rather as
something enabled per regulator or at least per board.
The warning would be a bit interesting; ideally there should be one
since it's probably an indication that something is wrong but there
are probably going to be use cases for it that can't be covered by
always_on, not that I can think of any right now.
