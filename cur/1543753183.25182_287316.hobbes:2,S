I'll take a dig. The ones I've got are for 2.4 so relate to old code.

The former would be a disaster for Fedora for example - we ship
'current' kernels and having kernel upgrades require a new X11 won't
endear users . A runtime check on version might work I was wondering if
it would be better to have an actual interface that said "do/do not
restore the extra bits in kernel".
That also avoids any suprises and regressions ?

I'm not video maintainer but other than the detection question it looks
sensible to me.
