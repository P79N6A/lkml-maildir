Oh, look - revoke() thread again ;-) Dunno... ->f_op *may* be the right
solution, but I didn't look at it too hard. BSD solution is cleaner,
but then it involves additional check on all pathes (they do it on
something between our dcache and inode layers marking the vnode as bad;
not too fine for our setup, since way too may places rely on (a) ability
to pick the inode with iget() and (b) assumption that inode is never, ever
unhashed while in use.) We *might* get out alive if we would guarantee
that if inode is marked bad it would prevent the appearance of the new
copy until it will become clean. Will require non-trivial playing with
fs/inode.c, but it may be doable...
