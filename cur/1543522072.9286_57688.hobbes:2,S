Definitely :)  As I stated before, the config magic would be insane

1) This *really* isolates things and minimizes download. :)
2) The *vast* majority (like it or not) won't care about the source
   (whether they "should" or not is another issue, but sadly even
    computer companies will call a Red Hat before digging into the source
    themselves, as they'd rather just deal with a kernel expert)
3) The source is still quite available :)
4) LXR and similar (McVoy's site, I forget) are still around for people
   to browse through the source, and with a much nicer interface than
   just a dump of files in a dir... if you only care about fs/buffer.c
   then such an interface can get you just that source, very nicely
   linked and prettified, w/o wasting time and bandwidth on the rest
   of the kernel source :)
5) People that want the source and want to build on their own will
   continue to do so, this just helps out the majority of people
   "coming in" who just needs/wants a built kernel of ver X.Y.Z
   which they won't find in a place like rawhide (esp. true for
   dev kernels, 2.3.x in this case) but would like that kind of
   easy-access binary-built access to the development tree (more
   testers is a Good Thing(tm) and the CGI can make a simple
   enough warning in the 2.{3,5,etc}.x dev kernels)
6) No more questions on lkml about "why does it say System too big?"
   as we could either a) always build bzImage, or b) zImage, catch
   the case of too big and bzImage when found (only the chaining and
   piggybacking code would need recompile AFAIK so it'd be fast)
7) This doesn't stop your user-space server idea ... choice is good! :)

Actually, this approach can be even better since:
1) the CGI or kernel building daemon can check for these buglets simple
   enough during the build process, log them, and report them to a)
   the user b) lkml if we choose c) some general "warnings and errors
   in kernel X.Y.Z build process" page where we just log these.
   It gets the kernel a little closer to tinderbox-ish status.
2) We can *definitely* "see" these buglets whereas a person building
   the kernel on their own may just ignore them (or not see them as they
   scroll on by) as long as the kernel binary builds (we've all been
   there, where we cared more about testing a new feature than reporting
   some compiler warning :)

Absolutely.  I don't want to interfere with the process, but keep in
mind that there's a huge pool of people that don't test on 2.3.x simply
because it's beyond them (and bad builders and bad coders doesn't mean
bad testers... they can report results) and they can't find a built
kernel (rpm-based or otherwise) already in place for them to test with.
This is from experience where benchmarking people I know want to get
a 2.3.latest rpm and just install it... they don't care about building
the kernel per-se, they just want it for their purpose, perhaps to check
against RH 6.1 stock for perf. differences.
Actually, thought, this approach can *enhance* the development
process... a ton of patches on kernel.org (esp. under people/) (or
people.redhat.com, or whatever) don't get tested as much as they "should"
simply because the developer doesn't have the time to be a cheerleader
and tell a ton of people to go try the patch.
With this site, through any of a few diff. methods (being a real
kernel.org mirror, some "* * * * */10" cron job and using LWP::Simple,
etc) the patches developers have made to a kernel could be presented
to a user building a development kernel (with an additional warning,
beyond even the regular "this is a DEV kernel" one).  
This means a lower bar of technical requirement to be a dev kernel tester,
and *also* means a larger potential based of testers.  While we believe
"it's open source, so the entire world can test" the fact is that a lot
of potential testers find building the kernel intimidating... but they
surf web sites and click options in CGI forms all day long :)
We can even allow a file upload field on the form for patches, which
enables 2 great things:
1) A kernel developer, wishing to make not-so-clued person foo@bar.com
   a tester for his patch, can quickly fill out the form and CGI upload
   his patch, filling in the "email address to be notified" field with
   foo@bar.com (we can add a cc: field for additional notification)
2) People doing embedded or underpowered development (high schooler with
   the 486's around him) can get new kernels much faster... the make -j9
   on the 8-way machine that Penguin Computing is loaning to the project
   (I hope :) will build in around a minute and he can quickly get a
   kernel or test out some quick hack patch.
Side note: Companies (penguin, rhat, suse, lnux, etc) then have a very
  simple method for "giving back to the community", just donate CPU
  cycles to building new kernels. :)
As from before, we can cache modules with the same relevant config
   if we're getting CPU-bound and get a kernel to a person much quicker
   than any other possible method.

While I can understand your concern, we're just talking about *adding*
a functionality.  People like you and I are going to continue doing kernel
fetches (patches, rsync, cvs update, etc) and building the way we do.
I'm not trying to pitch this as a cure-all, but I think it can take
a large step towards helping out the "typical" case that is becoming
more typical every day with the influx of new people (*many* of them,
if not most, coming from Windows, we have to admit).
Look at it this way... we can put a *lot* of kernel education (even
a page for "how to build your own kernel from source) on this site.
It's sure to get a decent number of hits (since people are going to
like the idea of rawhide-ish pre-built kernels of any ver they want)
so we can use this popularity to make a site that *educates* people
about what the kernel is, how to build one, etc.

1) We can limit queue depth, and if too deep, we can simply redirect to
   a page that details how to fetch and build the kernel (from above).
   Alternatively, warn if queue depth is over some number (20) and give a
   time estimate til completion, with a link (or just include on the same
   page) of the information to build your own kernel if they can't wait.
2) This can distribute easily as the backend compute servers could
   be any of an infinite list of machines donating cycles that we do
   a simple loadavg and ping check on before utilizing
3) The percentage of idle cycles in most machines (even powerful ones)
   is insane... ppl *look* to find ways to throw away cycles (seti,
   distributed.net :) so just think about all those cycles Linux
   zealots would be willing to donate to build kernels and help out the
   development process! :)
4) it already takes powerful machines to just be a kernel.org mirror
   (since that # of machines should be proportional to the # of ppl
   wanting/building kernels) and all those are getting space and CPU
   cycles donated... not a foreign concept :)
5) It's a CGI, sell advertising banner space to Linux companies in
   exchange for machines (done all the *time* by *lots* of places)

You'd probably have 
   a) more acceptance 
   b) more widespread use 
   c) more space savings
just using something like rsync -z (a very standard util on Linux machines
already :) since both your idea and that would require a uncompressed
kernel src dir... rsync will update drivers/arch's you don't have but
a) this *is* ascii kernel src... it'll compress well with the std zlib
from -z and b) utilizes a better algorithm (unless I misunderstood you)
and should help cut down as much as possible the delta data sent over
(aside from ignoring src files irrelevant to your build :)
I hashed over this at sublogic.com/ideas/index.html#kernel_rsync
already and while it happens in a few isolated spots, it looks like
it just isn't going to take off.  Since it seems like the CPU and
data req's are very similar to this idea (both would need at least
one good machine donated at the start to have a base to work from)
that's why I never really thought this would take off, either.

Quite true, but keep in mind that the lkml FAQ has a nice little rant about
how the bulk of the non-driver code is common, so it's worth noting that
while saving the other arch's is good, it's the sparing of other drivers
that would be the bulk of the savings. (not that it's not a large enough
savings, just worth noting)
Your major concern (as I understand it, please correct me if I'm wrong)
is that this would make ppl using kernels less "development-aware" but
I feel that 1) not any more than having binary rawhide kernels already
does, and 2) we can *use* this CGI as an informative site... one that'll
actaully get read by people (unlike the lkml FAQ, for instance :)
To reiterate, I don't see this as a replacement for your user-space
server approach... on the contrary, I love that idea and simply wanted to
throw this approach out since I had hashed it over before and it seemed
somewhat related :)
