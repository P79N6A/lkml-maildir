If you would use mmap, you would initialize the mutex inside the
mmaped area, i.e. directly in the file.
To the copying:
Short answer: 
http://www.lambdacs.com/cpt/FAQ.html#Q15
Slightly longer:
pthread_mutex_t m1, m2;
pthread_mutex_init(&m1, NULL);
pthread_mutex_lock(&m1);
m2 = m1;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&m2);
How can you be sure, that you have unlocked m1 here?
Yes, you throw away the cmutex after returning from the function and
the copy inside the file is the only one left. I still think such code
should not be in a documentation.
