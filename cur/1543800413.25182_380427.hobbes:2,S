Make sure you're in the directory of 2.6.15-rc7-rt1 (head Makefile and
see if you see:)
----
$ head Makefile
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 15
EXTRAVERSION =-rc7-rt1
NAME=Sliding Snow Leopard
# *DOCUMENTATION*
# To see a list of typical targets execute "make help"
# More info can be located in ./README

Then in that same directory try:
patch -p1 --dry-run < my-rtc-patchfile
See if it works, and if it does try it again without the --dry-run
option.  I just tried applying it to a clean 2.6.15-rc7-rt1 and it
worked.
