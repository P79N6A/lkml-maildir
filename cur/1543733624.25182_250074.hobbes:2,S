So I take it your platform won't soft fail the accesses and return all 1s?  On 
ia64, I've got a patch to add some machine check code to deal with it, but it 
requires pre-registration of the regions that are to be used for legacy I/O 
(i.e. I have to record the memory range and pid at /proc/bus/pci mmap time so 
that the machine check handler can send a SIGBUS).  A potentially cleaner 
option which Ben and I would prefer is to use the vga device Jon is creating 
to do legacy I/O with explicit read/write or ioctl calls.
