I don't use the aic79xx driver in the -ac tree. In another thread, 1 or 2
weeks ago Justin Gibbs stated, that his latest drivers are the most
stable. I'm using an Intel 7501VW2 motherboard in a production server, so
I don't want to test drivers, which can cause filesystem corruption. Maybe
Lukasz can test with noapic - I suggest Justin's drivers, and if the
problem still exists, test with the 'noapic' boot parameter, and track
down the problem. Regards,
