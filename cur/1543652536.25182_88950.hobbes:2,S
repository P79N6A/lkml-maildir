The kernel knows which AC'97 chip is attached so it could be given a
table to specify chips where "volume" should either not be presented or
should be remapped. Do you know what AC97 chip is on your board (Linux
will print the info in the i810 load, windows and the manual probably
claim that you have that as your sound chip (typically "Analog
something" or "Crystal something").
