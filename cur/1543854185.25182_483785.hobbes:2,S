Thanks for this information.
Are any of the following Atari options that are also on my
"BROKEN since at least 2.6.0" list also being revived?
- HADES (arch/m68k/Kconfig)
- ATARI_ACSI (drivers/net/Kconfig)
- ATARI_BIONET (drivers/net/Kconfig)
- ATARI_PAMSNET (drivers/net/Kconfig)
- ATARI_SCSI (drivers/scsi/Kconfig)
