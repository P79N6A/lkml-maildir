Nope.  ;)

The vmalloc area, along with all of those other structures _have_ other
data structures.  Now, it will take a wee bit more patching to directly
tag those thing with explicit container pointers (or accounting
references), but I would much prefer that, especially for the things
that are larger than a page.
I worry that this approach was used instead of patching all of the
individual subsystems because this was easier to maintain as an
out-of-tree patch, and it isn't necessarily the best approach.
