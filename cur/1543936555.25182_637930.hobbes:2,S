Simply because the only I/O that XFS does during a delete is
to the log and the log does async I/O and hence the process
never blocks in I/O.
Instead, it blocks in a far more complex space reservation that
may or may not be related to I/O wait....

rm -rf is not seek bound on XFS - it's generally determined by
the sequential write speed of the block device or how fast your
CPU is....

Async I/O means that typically your CPU does not get held up
waiting for I/O to complete....
Cheers,
