Indeed. However the unreviewed out-of-tree driver is based on the kernel
one. But since:
- it's close to impossible to compile tools to change the operation mode
  of the card
- SBE card owners will not notice that the LMC driver might work for
  them
- the LMC and the SBE driver will clash if both compiled
the best we can do for our users is to recommend using the SBE drivers
and complain to SBE about problems.

There is a suitable replacement: the SBE driver. But since there's no
volunteer to keep it updated in the kernel it'd be better to drop it.
I've spent several hours untangling the mess and I'd really like to help
other not getting hit by this.
