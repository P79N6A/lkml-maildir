Thanks for those hints.  However, my testing didn't go quite
as well as that.
2.6.12-rc2-mm3 reboots vmlinux-recover-UP on panic.
(vmlinux-recover-SMP hangs during [early] reboot, but -UP
goes further....)
(BTW, how does I do serial console from the second
kernel...?  It has the drivers, but not the command
line info?  TBD.)
vmlinux-recover-UP gets to this point, hand-written,
several lines missing:
kfree_debugcheck: bad ptr c3dbffb0h.  ( == %esi)
kernel BUG at <bad filename>:23128!
invalid operand: 0000 [#1]
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
EIP is at kfree_debugcheck+0x45/0x50
Stack dump shows lots of ext3 cache and inode functions...
On a dual-proc P4 with 1 GB RAM.
