Hi Rafael.
Probably you haven't got any answers yet because you should NEVER EVER 
(i repeat: NEVER EVER, not even in college projects) go for file I/O in 
the kernel. You might want to think the whole thing over one or two 
times, i think.
If it comes to you that it is absolutely necessary (i repeat again: 
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, like a solution to feed the world) then you might 
google for some ancient FAQ of Greg (K-H) (i think he was) where he 
tries to give a little more details about this kind of problem, and also 
gives a possible solution, IIRC. Sorry that i don't remember the exact 
page/adress anymore, for i intend never to look at it again.
