When the UML boot gets to the userspace part it gets really really
slow.  It takes about 20 times the normal time to fully boot.  CPU
seems to be idle.
Guest version doesn't matter.  Host version 2.6.27 was OK, latest git
is not OK.  I'm running 32bit guest on 64bit host.
Anyone else experiencing this?
Thanks,
Miklos
