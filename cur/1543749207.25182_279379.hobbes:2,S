That is probably a good change but not sufficient for things like
bladeservers where some vendors use short 40c cables which are within
specification but break drive side detection. Removing ata66 forcing
doesn't work because of these although perhaps it could be done using
subvendor ids so it is automatic ?
Right now I plan to keep ata66 overrides in -ac.
