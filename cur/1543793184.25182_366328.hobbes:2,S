Mostly this is a piece of making the kernel relocatable, and I
have been holding off on that set of patches until I can get
the rest of the patches I have worked on for kexec on panic
merged.
I can only track so many bug reports at a time :)
This patch stands by itself so it should not be a problem.
One of the things I discovered when working with this patch is
that ld when can't actually cope with absolute symbols in a shared
library and will try and relocate them anyway.  I have code in my
tree that works around that particular ld bug but it is nowhere near
as nice as just specifying -shared when linking.  This patch is indeed
needed for that.
