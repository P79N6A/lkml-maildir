Unless there is some hidden feature that lets
me specify the ELF note number directly, no way.
The sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) call does not return an
error code when used on a 2.2.xx i386 kernel.
You get an arbitrary value that fails for ARM,
Alpha, and any system with modified HZ.
You can't rely on sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF)
or sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) either. You'll
get back a 0 from the SPARC glibc, which really
means 0 processors since -1 is the error code.
Whatever the question, "use sysconf" is most
likely not the answer.
The man page ought to mention this.
