a) sysfs doesn't allow mkdir/rmdir and thus avoids an imperial buttload
of races - witness the crap in devfs.
b) rmdir of non-empty directory pretty much guarantees another buttload of
races.
c) mkdir creating non-empty directory or rmdir removing non-empty directory
is *ugly*.  BTW, Roman's "filesystem" for modules in its current form is
vetoed, as far as I'm concerned - this sort of magic is just plain wrong.
