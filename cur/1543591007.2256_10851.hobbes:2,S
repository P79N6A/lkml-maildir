UNIX-like ones (and that includes QNX) are easy. HFS is hopeless - it won't
be fixed unless authors will do it. Tigran will probably fix BFS just as a
learning experience ;-) ADFS looks tolerably easy to fix. AFFS... directories
will be pure hell - blocks jump from directory to directory at zero notice.
NTFS and HPFS will win from switch (esp. NTFS). FAT is not a problem, if we
are willing to break CVF and let author fix it. Reiserfs... Dunno. They've
got a private (slightly mutated) copy of ~60% of fs/buffer.c. UDF should be
OK. ISOFS... ask Peter. JFFS - dunno.
So probably we'll have to keep the buffer cache (AFFS looks like a real
killer), but we will be able to do pagecache-only versions of a_ops methods.
If fs has no metadata in buffer cache we can drop unmap_underlying_metadata()
for it.
