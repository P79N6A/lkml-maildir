Hello!
I am currently running the tarball linux-2.2.17 from ftp.kernel.org on a 
RedHat Linux 6.2 server. The server is a Dell PowerEdge 4300 with 1GB RAM 
, 2 x PIII600 and a DRAC PERC2/SC RAID controller.
The server mainly runs software like MySQL Server, Samba Server, NFS 
Server and LDAP Server.
All is working well except that randomly, sometimes afer a few days or 
sometimes after many weeks, the following error message would appear when 
I type dmesg at the shell prompt.
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 50 to 1
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 50 to 2
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 50 to 3
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 50 to 4
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 53 to 4
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 53 to 5
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 53 to 6
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 53 to 7
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 49 to 0
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 49 to 1
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 49 to 2
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 49 to 3
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 56 to 7
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 56 to 8
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 56 to 9
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 56 to 10
And when I check up on /proc/rtc, it is no longer running and is stuck at 
the time when the first set_rtc_mmss error occurs. When I tried to run 
programs like setclock to update the hardware clock, it just jams there 
for a very long time and a strace shows that it is trying to access 
/proc/rtc .

                     USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
/proc/rtc           
No process references; use -v for the complete list
Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this problem? The only 
solution that I came across till date is to reboot the server and then 
set back the correct date/time in the CMOS before allowing the server to 
bootup.
Many thanks in advance!
