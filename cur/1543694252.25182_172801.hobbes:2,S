Then the degenerative case is no compression at all. There is no
advantage to writing a block that is 1/N full of compressed data.
You end up having to write the whole block anyway.
This problem was well developed in the days where RLE (at the hardware
level) was used to extend the size of hard disks from their physical
size of about 38 megabytes to about 70 megabytes. The minimim size
of a read or write is a sector.
So, lets's use the minimum compression alogithm, no sliding
dictionaries complicating things, just RLE and see.
The alogithm is a sentinal byte, a byte representing the number
of bytes to expand -1, then the byte to expand. The sentinal byte
in RLE was 0xbb. If you needed to read/write a 0xbb, you need
to expand that to three bytes, 0xbb, 0x00, 0xbb.
                                  |     |     |___ byte to expand
                                  |     |________ nr bytes (0 + 1)
                                  |______________ sentinal byte
All other sequences will reduce the size. So, we have a 512-
byte sector full of nulls, what gets written is:
        0xbb, 0xff, 0x00, 0xbb, 0xff, 0x00
           |     |     |     |     |     |___ byte value
           |     |     |     |     |_________ 256 bytes
           |     |     |     |_______________ sentinal
           |     |     |_____________________ byte value
           |     |___________________________ 256 bytes
           |_________________________________ sentinal.
In this example, we have compressed a 512 byte sector to
only 6 bytes. Wonderful! Now we have to write 512 bytes
so that effort was wasted. FYI, I invented RLE and I also
put it into JMODEM the "last" file-transfer protocol that
I created in 1989.

Any time you are bound to a minimum block size to transfer,
you will have this problem.
