"hlt" is equivalent to ACPI processor power state C1,
When ACPI is loaded, it replaces the idle function with its own
(drivers/acpi/ospm/processor/prpower.c::pr_power_idle() ), which places
the processors in lower power states gradually.
I once documented all of the states in a readable format. I will post it
once I get back from lunch...
