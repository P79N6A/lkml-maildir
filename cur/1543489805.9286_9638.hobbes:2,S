I'm running an Advansys 940U with 2 disks and one optical
attached, on an SMP system. Under 2.2.0-pre*, 2.2.0 and
2.2.1 I've had quite a bit of trouble booting correctly.
In 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 things seem to have returned to good
again, but I can easily see the Advansys driver breaking
in marginal situations...
I guess it's time to fetch the Advansys experts :)
