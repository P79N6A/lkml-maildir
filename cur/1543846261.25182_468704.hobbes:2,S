Hello,
I was wondering what CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE is about and the only hint I 
found was this: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/25/285
That's why I was about to send the attached patch. However, from looking 
at the comments in drivers/dma/dmaengine.c, it seems to be about 
non-HW-specific DMA support:
"This code implements the DMA subsystem. It provides a HW-neutral
  interface for other kernel code to use asynchronous memory copy
  capabilities"
Because I don't know anything about the innards of DMA, can someone 
please enlighten me what this knob is for and why one should enable it?
Thanks,
Christian.
