Hi Ingo,
System hangs on my notebook with RT-0.7.31-15 when running
"/sbin/hwclock --hctosys --localtime".
Cursor stops blinking, no response to SysRq-b.
But if I set "hardirq-preempt=0" in kernel command line, the problem is
gone.
config is attached. Is there anything I can do to provide you more
useful informantion?
