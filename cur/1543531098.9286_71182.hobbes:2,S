Here's the story:
	struct thing
	{
 	       char *s;
 	       int i;
	};
	struct thing t1 = { "foo", 4 };
	struct thing t2 = { "foo", 4 };
Compiled normally this will put a single instance of "foo" into the
read-only data section .rodata.
Compiled with '-fwritable-strings' the compiler will put _two_ copies of
"foo" into the writable data section .data.
However I'm not sure this is a good idea - it will prevent quite a bit
of (usually desirable) string sharing.  One embedded systems the .data
section would have to be copied out to RAM at boot, so
-fwritable-strings will use more RAM.
Plus...   Shouldn't the kernel be marking the .rodata pages as
read-only?  We should really be faulting on a write to .rodata (and
.text!).
The code Tim has found won't work if, for example, the kernel is put in
ROM.  I think strdup()ing it is the right thing to do.

But they really should be moved out of .rodata if we're going to write
to them.
