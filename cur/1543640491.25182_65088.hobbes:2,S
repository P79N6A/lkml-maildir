Hi,
I have a bash script which modifies some environment
variables and does some other housekeeping things.
But problem is that when script finishes running,
new values of environment variables are no longer
visible in parent shell. So what should I do so that
these new values are visible in parent. I don't want
to run as ". file.sh". I have to run it as "file.sh"
only.
Kindly mail me at venkatraghu2002@yahoo.com
Regards
Venkat.
