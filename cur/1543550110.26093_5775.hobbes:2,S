I consider #2 an advantage.  Interfaces are brutally changed, _when that 
will improve the kernel_.  So the kernel is improved even though
existing
code breaks.  The new pagecache broke all filesystems forcing much
rewriting.
And it was a good thing too:  speeding it up noticeably, nearly halving
memory
use in some cases, and lessening complexity.  The latter part is also
good for SMP scaling.  
Oses that don't occationally change internal API's get stuck with
bad design decicions.  We should ideally design perfect from the start,
but face it, that don't always happen.  And it is sometimes impossible 
as hardware and sw ideas nobody thought of before show up.
