Hey, without your reset fix it was 11 seconds slower. ;-)
Well, it used to be around 1.7 seconds to resume, and now (after the fixes)
it's 2.8 (according to the dmesg timestamps). But the first timestamp printed
was 0.7, and now it's 2.1, so I don't know if it's a real slowdown or that the timer
is set correctly earlier. That was with 2.19 btw, I don't know what happened in
the meantime. I suspect the timer changes. To know for sure I'd need to boot
an older kernel and measure resume time with a stopwatch.

I like your idea below more. ;-)

I can't speak for others, but for me this would fix all regressions and even
disk spin up seems half a second faster without the START_STOP.
It would also solve the laptopmode thing, not unnecessarily spinning up
disks that don't need to be (if the hardware doesn't do it).
