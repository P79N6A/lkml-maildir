I don't believe you'd be able to use GRE tunnels, as they are not an "Ethernet" 
type of tunnel.
However, I run a network with three physical locations, bridged over TAP-type 
tunnels using VTUN (vtun.sourceforge.net). These are Ethernet-type tunnel 
devices, so the bridge code just sees them as if it was any other Ethernet 
network interface.
In addition, I use ebtables to control what traffic gets bridged across the 
tunnels, so extraneous broadcast/multicast traffic stays where it is supposed to.
