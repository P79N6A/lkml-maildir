The analogy is too subtle for  me,
but my question was not whether the correct error
response should be to panic, but whether there was a good reason for allowing
such a huge number of users of a lock.

There's a difference between a completely reasonable situation in which 
all of some resource has been committed
 and a situation which in itself indicates some sort of fundamental error. 
If  32K+ users of a lock is an  errror, then returning -ENOMEM may be
inadequate.

Ok. I'm  too nice a guy to think about malicious users so I simply considered
the kernel error  case.
You probably want a diagnostic so people who get mysterious slowdowns can
report:
	/var/log/messages included the message "Too many users on lock 0x..."
