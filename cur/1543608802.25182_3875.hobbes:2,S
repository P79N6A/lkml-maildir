Andrew,
I have been getting thousands of these when the system was under heavy 
load, but didn't realize it was from the ext3 code!  I'm using Linus's 
2.4.14-pre7 + ext3 patch from Neil Brown's site (the latter is identified 
as "ZeroNineFourteen".)  Would you like me to upgrade kernel and patch?
Steve
