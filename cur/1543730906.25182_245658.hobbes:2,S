I don't think so.  Look at what's going on.  If "ret" is IRQ_HANDLED
all well and fine.  However, look at how "retval" is being used:
static void __report_bad_irq(int irq, irq_desc_t *desc, irqreturn_t action_ret)
{
...
        if (action_ret != IRQ_HANDLED && action_ret != IRQ_NONE) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "irq event %d: bogus return value %x\n",
                                irq, action_ret);
        } else {
                printk(KERN_ERR "irq %d: nobody cared!\n", irq);
        }
So, we're looking to see not only if a handler returned IRQ_HANDLED,
but also if a handler returned _some other value_ other than IRQ_HANDLED
or IRQ_NONE.
