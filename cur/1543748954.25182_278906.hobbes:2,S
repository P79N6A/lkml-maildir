I don't imagine anyone would miss that behaviour, we can probably have
something more useful than a
cat: /etc: Is a directory
message.

ok, I don't really care about the trailing slash. The reading method
(read() vs. readdir()) may be enough to distinguish the uses. The
trailing / is still a useful (and logical) visual notation though for
the different meanings, so something like ls could give both versions.
