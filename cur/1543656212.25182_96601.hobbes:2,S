Take a look at the changeset at
http://linus.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/diffs/drivers/ieee1394/dv1394.c@1.15?nav=index.html
|src/|src/drivers|src/drivers/ieee1394|hist/drivers/ieee1394/dv1394.c.
Your big BLOB merge basically undoes everything in there.

It was Al's patch, not mine.

In fact it's not difficult at all with a proper SCM, a bit of care and the
right attitude.  I merge the changes from XFS (and about half a donzend
XFS-related repositories inside SGI that all need proper merging / keeping
in sync) to Linus all the time.  And by keeping the changesets (or atomic
commits in SVN terminlogoy) as one patch each, hand-editing as needed when
merge conflicts arrive that works very well, even if I had been away and
the changes for four weeks need merging or as now we're five patchlevels
away from Linus tree (at 2.5.47).  I've not lost a single upstream change
with that merge policy yet.
And no, that's no BK advertisment, SGI uses a RCS-based SCM internally and
I use unfied diffs to get it into a staging repository for Linus to pull.
