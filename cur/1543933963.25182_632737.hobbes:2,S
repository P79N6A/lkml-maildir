Hi !
i build a kernel with allmodconfig and didn`t get my system to boot with that.
after some investigation i found that it was due to udev:
udevd[1226]: init_udev_socket: error getting socket: Address family not supported by protocol 
this was missing support UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS at boot time.
easy - so i added unix.ko to my initrd.
but that didn`t make a difference. Still same error with udev.
seems, there are others who stepped into this trap and someone telling, unix domain sockets cannot be modular

since we have 1206 options set to "Y" anyway, would it make sense to remove module support for Unix Domain Sockets ?
opensuse103:/home/kernel/linux-2.6.23 # cat .config.allmodconfig |grep "=y" |wc -l
1206
opensuse103:/home/kernel/linux-2.6.23 # cat .config.allmodconfig |grep "=m" |wc -l
