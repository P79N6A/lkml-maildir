Hiya Greg
While sorda on the topic ... since I did the w83781d driver some time
ago, I changed boards for a P4C800 (Intel 875 chipset), that have a
ICH5 southbridge, and not a ICH4 one ....  I tried to add the ID's
to the i810 driver, and although it does load (even without the
ID's added), the I2C bus/sensor does not show in /sys.  The w83781d
driver also load fine btw.
Any ideas ? Anybody working on 875 support that I can help test ?
Thanks,
