For rawhide see 
ftp://ftp.twiddle.net/pub/rth/rawhide.pdf.
  For
sable, I have no docs -- you might see if you can get them from
Jay Estabrook.
Rawhide can most definitely do smp irq handling properly.  I just
didn't want to confuse the issue, not being able to test that one.

MY point is that <asm/hw_irq.h> is _NOT_ architecturally clean.
It provides _NOTHING_ needed by generic parts of the kernel. 
And in my not so humble opinion, if it isn't needed by anything
outside the backend, I shouldn't have to expose it to anything
outside of the backend.

Yes, and that's too bad.  Perhaps we can get this bit o sillyness
cleaned up in the x86 port as well.

If and when that happens, we can rearrange things.  When I see
what's needed for such a generic irq.c, I'll put what's needed
in that file.  But even if that happens irq_impl.h will STILL
exist, because e.g. init_pyxis_irqs has no business in asm/hw_irq.h.

No.  Please respect my wishes on this and do not send Linus
a patch to move it back.
