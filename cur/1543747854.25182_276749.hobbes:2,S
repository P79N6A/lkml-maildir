Personally, the reason _I_ hate C++ is that I got tired of having to 
learn the obtuse
combinations of symbols and excess keywords necessary to bludgeon my
favorite refcount and memory management systems into the C++ objects.  
It just
wasn't worth the effort when I could write equivalent, better, and 
easier to read
code in C.
