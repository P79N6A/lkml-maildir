The intention _is_ clear indeed.  That ought to be all we need really.
If it comes to the worst and somneone in court claims that binary
is their preferred form for _modification_ - have them demonstrate their
way of working to prove it can be done.  "Now write 'hello world'
in binary.  Wow, you managed that!  Now add a triple loop to it..."
This could be really interesting.
Somehow, I believe a driver written directly in binary (without even
assembly source) would be easy to reimplement from scratch in C.  
Because it'd be so small.
