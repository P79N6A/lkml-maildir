D/HIPS stand for device/host initiated power saving.  These modes use 
two SATA link powersaving state (partial and slumber).  Static mode 
simply turns off PHY on unoccupied port using SControl register.  So, if 
you have an access to a notebook which has a SATA dock which support 
link powersaving, you can test it by...
* set link powersaving mode to HIPS/static. (mode 4)
* w/ device inserted, leave it idle for 15 seconds and record power 
consumption level (link should be in slumber state).
* pull out the device, wait for libata to detach the device and record 
power consumption level (libata should have turned off PHY after 
detaching the device).
I wanna know whether there is any difference in the amount of power 
saved between slumber and off states.

Yeap.

Can you describe what you've done in more detail?  Do you have dmesg of 
the 30sec wait?

So, do you think we're ready for another PM infrastructure update?  :-P
