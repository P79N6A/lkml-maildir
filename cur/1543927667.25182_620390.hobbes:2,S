mmap: mmap call failed: errno: 12 errmsg: Cannot allocate memory
Yep, that's "fixed" the problem alright!  No way this puppy is
dirtying 2Gb of memory any more.
http://linux.brong.fastmail.fm/2007-11-22/bmtest.pl
That said, pushing the size down to 1700 rather than 2000 in that
file makes it run, and the behaviour matches the 2000 Mb case on
2.6.16.55 rather than 2.6.20.20 or 2.6.23.1 (my other test case
kernels that happened to be pre-built on that machine)
[root@lb1 ~]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       4149836    2073056    2076780          0      22036    1846096
-/+ buffers/cache:     204924    3944912
Swap:      2096472          0    2096472
That's after running the 1700Mb version.  You can see this machine is our
one remaining 4Gb machine (it's not running any production services unlike
the 6Gb machine, so it's better for testing)
Anyway - looks like this may be a "good enough" solution for out1 if
it can manage an ~2Gb file with 6Gb of memory available.  I'll test
that later today - but I should drag myself into the office now...
