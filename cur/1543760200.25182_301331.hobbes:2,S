With version 2.6.10 the driver for the tuner frontend from ALPS TDLB7 
was removed.
Why do you think that this is a dead file?
While I'm happy with the work you do for dvb on Linux, and I want to 
thank you for this anyway, my TV does not work anymore! :(
I use a TechoTrend Premium card with that frontend on it. It worked 
fine until 2.6.10.
Can you put it back into mainline? Is there some work to do for 
reinsertion?
regards
	Peter
