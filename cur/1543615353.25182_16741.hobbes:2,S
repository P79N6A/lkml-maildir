I never got the impression that DMI was going to be the exclusive way of
obtaining information, but rather, as a supplement.  For example, currently
loaded and functioning drivers may also be analyzed in a variety of ways.
I seem to remember this being described as a goal for CML2 back when ESR
first started talking about it, but I can't find appropriate posts anywhere
(kinda vague thing to look for :-).  And this kind of stuff was discussed
than as well.  Either that or I'm completely mis-remembering.
