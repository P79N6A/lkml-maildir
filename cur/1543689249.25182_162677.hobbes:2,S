And this interface will look like what?
What is wrong with the current kernel API interface?

"remove"???

So "drivers" are a third class citizen?  They don't need to be under the

How would this help this?  The kernel would get bigger somehow, right?

We can do that today with modules.

What?
Ok, I'm just giving up now.
But remember, patches are always welcome.  Please post your code to
implement this system if you come up with some.
Good luck,
