How about something like this instead?
printk(KERN_WARNING "Uhhuh. NMI received. Dazed and confused\n");
printk(KERN_WARNING "You probably have a hardware problem with your
RAM chips\n");
if (panic_on_unrecovered_nmi)
        panic("NMI: panic_on_unrecovered_nmi enabled - Not continuing");
else
        printk(KERN_WARNING "NMI: panic_on_unrecovered_nmi disabled -
continuing\n");
First of all then it won't start out by saying that it's going to
continue, only to panic a few lines down.
Secondly it shows clearly to anyone reading the messages that there's
a control available for changing the behaviour, and that person can
then go look up how that's done.
Just a suggestion...
