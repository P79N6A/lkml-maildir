Roman,
Trying to clear up the nomenclature here, according to SAM-2
( www.10.org ) target ports have mandatory "identifiers"
and optional "names". The WWUI in iSCSI is part of the
target _identifier_. SAM-2 is pretty vague about "names"
but it does note that for a logical unit, its _name_
may be reported in the Device Identification VPD page in
an INQUIRY.
