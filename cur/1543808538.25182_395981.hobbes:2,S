I'm not the maintainer of a program, and hence I don't have to.
But why in the hell do you even _need_ SCSI in userspace when the kernel 
provides complete facilities? And even then your argument is specious, since 
when I did go through the code for libscg all it provided was a simple 
wrapper around those kernel facilities for as many OS's as had them. And for 
the OS's that didn't have it, then you implemented what you could. You really 
need to stop with the finger pointing and accept that you have a problem in 
your philosophy.
