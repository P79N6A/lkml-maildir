Why do you say that you got usb2 to crash?  The log you posted clearly 
shows that the crash originated in the reiserfs code, caused by a series 
of I/O errors.
Your log doesn't give any indication why those I/O errors occurred; in 
fact it starts in the middle of the errors.  If you want to find out what 
really went wrong, you will have to turn on the usb-storage debugging 
option in your kernel's configuration.
