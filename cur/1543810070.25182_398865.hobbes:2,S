This sort of patch isn't as interesting as actually fixing the mess 
known as include/linux/sched.h and include/linux/sched.h...  Most places 
in the kernel don't actually need the majority of sched.h, just a handful 
of functions like set_task_state().  fs.h is another tangled web of 
dependancies.  I did some experimenting back in the 2.2 days and it was 
possible to cut something like 10-20% off the kernel build time.
That said, it's a big job.
