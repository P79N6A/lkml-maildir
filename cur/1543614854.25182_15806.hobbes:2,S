The easy way to do this is to build a tree mirroring the kernel tree
with each file containing the addresses of the interest list. Directories
would contain a .interest file to indicate interest in the entire
directory.
Then a 'curl 
http://www.kernel.org/interest?file=foo/bar/baz
' gets you the
interest list.
Unfortunately you need some sort of confirmation step around the 'add
interest' bit to avoid people adding you to the root of the tree.
