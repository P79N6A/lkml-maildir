If a process belongs to several group of processes, an new integer in
the task_struct is not enough, you need a list or something like this.
If you're using a list you need to add function to manage this list in
the kernel but we don't want to add this kind of management inside the
kernel because with the fork connector we can keep it outside.

This patch is an old one with many kernel modifications that impacts the
Linux performance. That's why we thought about another solution where
all management is done by a user space daemon. Currently we're using the
fork connector.

I don't need real time. I just need to know which process forks during
the accounting period. The user space daemon provided by ELSA just keeps
a trace of parents and its children during a given period (generally
it's the accounting period). The analysis will be done later by another
application (also provided by ELSA) by using the trace of parents and
children plus the accounting trace.

We're trying to solve this one. I think that I answer to the integer
field problem. For the necessity of the per-group accounting, it can be
interesting to do accounting on a specific "task". For example if you
want to have accounting data for a compilation you can add the
corresponding shell in a group of processes and commands involved in the
compilation like gcc, cc, as, collect2, ... will be automatically added
in the same group and you will be able to get statistics about this
compilation.

There is a discussion about this with Jay Lan to merge the CSA and BSD
accounting framework. 
I don't know if there is some work around 1) and 4).
