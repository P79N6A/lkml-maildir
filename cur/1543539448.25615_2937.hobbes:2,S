Ug...first there is SMP safe and then NUMA safe?
How do we isolate problem areas now before they cause random effects on a NUMA port?
Is this something we should be concerned about now or is it going to be one of
those...we'll wait until it breaks and then worry about it things?
For example, I wanted to have a simple 1 int check for auditing to be on or off.
That way even if auditing is compile in or as a module, it would still have minimal
impact.  But it sounds like that global would have to have locks around it to
guarantee cache coherency.  Suddenly that doesn't look like such a good performance
improvement.  A Per-process byte might be a better way to go, less contention though
it sounds like I'd still have to lock even that.
