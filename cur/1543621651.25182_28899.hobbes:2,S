hi,
ive searched all over and found many references to this problem, but never found an actual solution.
the problem is that during heavy disk I/O, kupdated will periodically take up ALL the cpu.  like the mouse will stop responding, nothing moves.  the system is frozen until its done doing whatever its doing.
the problem is mostly evident on large file transfers or doing something like copying a large file or untarring a large tarball, etc.
i am running 2.4.17 on an IBM R30 thinkpad.  problem occurs on 2.4.16 also.
so is there already an answer about this that i just cant find?
any help appreciated, thanks.
