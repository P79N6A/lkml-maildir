I have just bought X61s, and it seems to have the very same soundcard as 
your T61p does:
00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)
        Subsystem: Lenovo Lenovo Thinkpad T61
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 17
        Memory at fe220000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]
        Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 2
        Capabilities: [60] Message Signalled Interrupts: Mask- 64bit+ Queue=0/0 Enable-
        Capabilities: [70] Express Unknown type IRQ 0
        Capabilities: [100] Virtual Channel
        Capabilities: [130] Unknown (5)
The sound also doesn't work with 2.6.24 (tried modprobing the 
snd-hda-intel with 'model=thinkpad', didn't make any difference). The 
mixer settings seem to be correct, but there is no sound.
Two strange things in alsamixer:
- it is possible to change volume of the "PCM" toggle, but it is missing 
  the possibility to mute/unmute (the box with "MM"/"OO" simply isn't 
  there)
- the "Headphone" toggle has "OO" as it is unmuted, but there is no 
  possibility to change its volume, the volume box is completely missing
Takashi, if you need any other information which would help resolving 
this, please let me know.
Thanks,
