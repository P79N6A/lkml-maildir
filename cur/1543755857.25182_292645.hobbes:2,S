I am as surprised as you are to see this here. I2C_ALGO_AU1550 should
really be made a different value. There is also a problem with
I2C_ALGO_PCA and I2C_ALGO_SIBYTE having the same value, which was
already reported to Greg some days ago if memory serves. I think I will
send a patch against 2.6.10-rc3 to Linus this evening, which fixes the
broken algo IDs. That way Mark can keep the algorithm ID he is using
right now, and each algorithm will get its own, unique ID, as should be.
You can see the i2c-id.h list from the legacy i2c project here:
  
http://www2.lm-sensors.nu/~lm78/cvs/i2c/kernel/i2c-id.h
I am indeed trying to keep it in sync with the one in Linux 2.6 (and with
the one in Linux 2.4 at times), in the hope it'll avoid confusion and
increase portability.
Thanks,
