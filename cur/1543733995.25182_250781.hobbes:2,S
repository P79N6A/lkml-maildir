Why do we care about profile_pc() here? It should do the right thing 
as-is.
What you care about is wchan, and stack unwiding _over_ the spinlocks. 
Since a spinlock can never be part of the wchan callchain, I vote we just 
change "in_sched_functions()" to claim that anything in the spinlock 
section is also a scheduler function as far as it's concerned.
That makes wchan happy, and profile_pc() really never should care.
