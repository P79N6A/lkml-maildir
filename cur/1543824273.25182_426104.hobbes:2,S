Unfortunately, cisco IOS also complains that packets are "duplicate".
And, regarding to your previous message on how to fix this - IIRC, if
I do connect() on this socket, it will refuse to receive datagrams
from hosts other than specified in connect(), and I will be unable to
bind another socket to the same port on my side.
That said, the only solution which is close to what been before, will
be to keep one socket for receive, and create socket for each router I
am communicating with, right?
