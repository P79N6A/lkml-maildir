drivers/macintosh/rtc.c works on every PPC system, except for APUS (they
have their own generic rtc driver from m68k they use).  This is a know
'issue' with 2.4, that's not really solvable for the reason Ben
mentioned.  In 2.5 hopefully we'll replace drivers/char/rtc.c with a
generic rtc driver (and remove the PPC, MIPS and m68k generic drivers at
the same time).
Eric, do you think you could modify the CONFIG_RTC help entry to mention
that on PPC you should use the CONFIG_PPC_RTC option and not CONFIG_RTC,
if in doubt?  That's probably the best fix for 2.4.x
