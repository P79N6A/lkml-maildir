Hi
I'm running Suse 9.0.
I'V upgraded to module-init-tools 0.9.15pre4
nd util-linux to 2.12pre.
The system runs without any probems with
kernel 2.4.21 but doesn't with kernel 2.6.0-test10
I can't login as any user in normal runlevels.
A script to set up network has shown an error:
chown root:root user unknown.
I also get en error: /dev/tty unknown device.
If I start in runlevel S i can log in as root
which doesn't work in any other runlevel.
I don't know where to look for the problem. I haven't
found an answer in Google or maillinglist archive.
All user accounts are stored in /etc/passwd / /etc/shadow.
Passwords are only encrypted with crypt().
I use PAM to authenticate.
With krenel 2.6.0-test9 I also got a very strange error when
some programs are started in init:
Invalid ELF header.
Any ides how to solve this?
Thank you for your help
Tilo
