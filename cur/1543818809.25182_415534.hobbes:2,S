well, your mistake seems to be that you probably haven't
tested this yet, because with the following (simple)
setups I seem to get what you consider impossible 
(of course, not as precise as your scheduler does it)
vcontext --create --xid 100 ./cpuhog -n 1 100 &
vcontext --create --xid 200 ./cpuhog -n 1 200 &
vcontext --create --xid 300 ./cpuhog -n 1 300 &
vsched --xid 100 --fill-rate 1 --interval 6
vsched --xid 200 --fill-rate 2 --interval 6
vsched --xid 300 --fill-rate 3 --interval 6
vattribute --xid 100 --flag sched_hard
vattribute --xid 200 --flag sched_hard
vattribute --xid 300 --flag sched_hard
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND            
   39 root      25   0  1304  248  200 R   74  0.1   0:46.16 ./cpuhog -n 1 300  
   38 root      25   0  1308  252  200 H   53  0.1   0:34.06 ./cpuhog -n 1 200  
   37 root      25   0  1308  252  200 H   28  0.1   0:19.53 ./cpuhog -n 1 100

and here the other way round:
vsched --xid 100 --fill-rate 3 --interval 6
vsched --xid 200 --fill-rate 2 --interval 6
vsched --xid 300 --fill-rate 1 --interval 6
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND            
   36 root      25   0  1304  248  200 R   75  0.1   0:58.41 ./cpuhog -n 1 100  
   37 root      25   0  1308  252  200 H   54  0.1   0:42.77 ./cpuhog -n 1 200  
   38 root      25   0  1308  252  200 R   29  0.1   0:25.30 ./cpuhog -n 1 300  
   45 root       0   0  1804  912  736 R    1  0.4   0:02.26 top -cid 20        
note that this was done on a virtual dual cpu
machine (QEMU 8.0) with 2.6.16-vs2.1.1-rc16 and
that there were roughly 25% idle time, which I'm
unable to explain atm ...
feel free to jump on that fact, but I consider
it unimportant for now ...
best,
