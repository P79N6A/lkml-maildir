That seems reasonable.  It probably is a bug to use normal_prio, since we
really do care what prio is at that time.

You mean for those that expire at the same time?
I don't think this is a problem, because the run_hrtimer_hres_queue runs
the hightest priorty callback first, then it adjusts its prio to the next
priority callback.  See hrtimer_adjust_softirq_prio.

I don't see this.

I still don't see this happening.

Don't think that is necessary.
