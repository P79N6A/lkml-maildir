global namespace. can be virtualized later.
can be optional.
But the idea is simple. Eventually you will need some management tools 
anyway. And they should be able to refer to containers.

It was discussed with Linus and the reason is provided in this text 
actually.
There are 2 ways:
- to add additional argument "container" to all the functions where it 
is required.
Drawbacks: a) lot's of changes, b) compilation without virtualization is 
not the same. c) increased stakc usage
- to add effective container pointer on the task. i.e. context which 
kernel should be in when works with virtualized resources.
Drawbacks: a) there are some places where you need to change effective 
container context explicitly such as TCP/IP.

can't catch what you mean :) is it prohibited somehow? :))))

To make a consensus people need to make mutual concessions... Otherwise 
these talks are useless.
