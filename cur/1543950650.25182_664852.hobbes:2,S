When I originally proposed these cleanups, I posted opened-coded 
versions.  That was deemed to be ugly and using a macro was suggested. 
So now I've reworked this with a macro, and now the macro is being 
deemed to be ugly, too!
The point of this exercise wasn't really to do a macro at all; the point 
was to get these structures marked 'const'  and into __devinitconst 
where they belong.  Whether the open-coded approach or the macro is the 
way to go, is all the same to me; any guidance on how to proceed would 
be appreciated.
