No - but the fault only happens when you are starting from a fesh tree.
Running mrporper would not delete the old .so file (kbuild 'lost' knowledge
of it). So most people have just untarred a new kernel on top
of the old one and it still worked.
Also the reason why I failed to fix it in the first place. xconfig and gconfig
worked even after mrproper - because the .so file survived.
