Well the only case it could matter is if you aren't allowed to access
/proc/<tgid> which I think may actually be the current selinux behavior.
So if we can't fix /proc/self we need to introduce /proc/task-self at
the top level, just to be certain we don't run into weird cases like
that.  Otherwise /proc/self/task/self sounds like a wonderful suggestion.
