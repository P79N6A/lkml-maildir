This would also be extremely useful on machines with large amounts
of memory, for write-back mappings.  With large amounts but odd sized
entries it becomes extremely tricky to map all of the memory using
mtrrs.
Last I looked the common remedy was to using overlapping mtrrs
which the kernel does not understand and that make it impossible
for X to setup write-combining MTRRs.
The memory map on x86 shows no hope of getting simpler and mtrrs 
are getting continually less good at being able to scale so getting
PAT support of some kind in the kernel would be extremely good.
