Well, that just means we need to check for things bound to a subset when
we fork it off. ie if we have cpus 1,2,3,4 ... and there is 
A bound to 1
B bound to 2
C bound to 3
D bound to 4
Then when I fork off exclusive subset for CPUs 1&2, I have to push A & B
into it. You're right, what I said was broken ... but it doesn't seem
hard to fix.
