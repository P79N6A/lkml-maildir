I don't know about isofs internals, but I thought you could do this without
any special support on the reader? When laying down the new session I believe
directory entries can be written which refer to files in previous sessions,
if the file is unchanged. If it is changed, the file is written to the new
session and the new directory entry points to that. If it doesn't exist, no
directory entry is written. Or are the directories from all the sessions
overlaid, in which case whiteouts would be needed?
