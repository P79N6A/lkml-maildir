Subject: [PATCH 0/9] AF_RXRPC socket family and AFS rewrite
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/2/365

The first of these patches together provide secure client-side RxRPC
connectivity as a Linux kernel socket family.  Only the RxRPC transport/session
side is supplied - the presentation side (marshalling the data) is left to the
client.  Copies of the patches can be found here:

http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/04-keys.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/05-af_rxrpc.diff
Further patches make the in-kernel AFS filesystem use AF_RXRPC and delete the
old RxRPC implementation:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/06-afs-cleanup.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/07-af_rxrpc-kernel.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/08-af_rxrpc-afs.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/09-af_rxrpc-delete-old.diff
The userspace access methods make use of the control data passed to/by
sendmsg() and recvmsg().  See the three simple test programs:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/klog.c
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/rxrpc.c
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/listen.c
TODO:
 (*) Make certain parameters (such as connection timeouts) userspace
     configurable.
 (*) Make userspace utilities use it; librxrpc.
 (*) Userspace documentation.
 (*) KerberosV security.
Changes:
 (*) SOCK_RPC has been removed.  SOCK_DGRAM is now used instead.
 (*) I've add a facility whereby calls can be made to destinations other than
     the connect() address of a client socket by making use of msg_name in the
     msghdr struct when using sendmsg() to send the first data packet of a
     call.  Indeed, a client socket need not be connected before being used
     so.
 (*) I've also added a facility whereby client calls may also be made on
     server sockets, again by using msg_name in the msghdr struct.  In such a
     case, the server's local transport endpoint is used.
 (*) I've made the write buffer space check available to various callers
     (sk_write_space) and implemented poll support.
 (*) Rewrote rxrpc_recvmsg().  It now concatenates adjacent data messages from
     the same call when delivering them.
 (*) Updated the documentation to include notes on recvmsg, cover control
     messages and cover SOL_RXRPC-level socket options.
 (*) Provided an in-kernel interface to give in-kernel utilities easier access
     to the facility.
 (*) Made fs/afs/ use it.
 (*) Deleted the old contents of net/rxrpc/.
