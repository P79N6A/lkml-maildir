Please instrument your workload with the following, and send logs of the
output (preferably compressed) to me and possibly others:
top b d 5
vmstat 5
while true; do cat /proc/vmstat; sleep 5; done
while true; do cat /proc/meminfo; sleep 5; done
A good way to log commands like this is:
(command) > /home/foo.log.1 2>&1 &
where parentheses surround the command in the actual shell input.
