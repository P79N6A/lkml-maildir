Subject: tcp urgent data broken since 2.5.34?

Since 2.5.34 I see a lot of processes hanging for a while.
I just looked at what might cause this, and I get the strong
impression that something went wrong with the 2.5.34 patch
that introduced sk_send_sigurg() (or possibly the signal
handling).
Phenomenon:
 B->A: urg 1
 B->A: some data
 A->B: ack for the urg
half a minute later:
 B->A: resend of some data
 A->B: ack
This is using rlogin/rlogind.
Will look further later, but in the meantime somebody might
see immediately what causes this.
