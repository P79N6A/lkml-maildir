PCI_ANY_ID first appeared in 2.3.x.  If this interface were to be used
under older kernels, manual support of the PCI_ANY_ID semantics in
pci_simple_probe() would be needed.

For the case of pci_simple_probe() I would like to keep it as small as
possible, hopefully only covering the most common cases.  Are there many
cases where knowing the class _and_ the device ids is more valuable than
knowing only the device ids?

In my experience one chip may appear on several different boards, so
having a table is very helpful.  If you have a single device id, it
would probably be better to call pci_find_xxx() directly.
Thanks for the comments.
