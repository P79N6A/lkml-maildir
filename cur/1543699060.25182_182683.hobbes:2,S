Where can we find documentation on sysfs and udev,
and on transition issues? I know devfs hasn't been
maintained for a long time but the documentation for
it comes with kernel source and there it is in menuconfig.
Every time I hear that udev and sysfs replace devfs I
wonder where to pick up the thread, where is that doc,
where is the menuconfig option ;-)  I guess there is a
website but to bring people out of devfs with their
/etc/devfs/compat_symlinks necessary to boot so
they will have to manually make edits, it would be
necessary to research the manual edits it takes to boot
(md0 vs. md/0, tty vs. vc, etc., /etc/inittab, maybe
etc pam or security ).
If transitioning from devfs to udev sysfs comes
down to one mistake so I can't boot and have to lilo
  append="rw init=/bin/bash" and edit /etc/innitab
then I need the doc on boot partition to make the
last edits to transition completely and save myself
(not docs on a website). Shouldn't udev sysfs doc
come with kernel source(maybe it does!?)?
