Don't let me stop you.
You can't expect us to act on anything based upon vague references
to "dst cache DoS" and things like that.
I also would appreciate it if you'd actually at least add the
networking maintainers to the CC: list when asking/discussing
such problems.  Bringing it up on places like linux-net and
netdev@oss.sgi.com would be a good idea too.
Random blather on linux-kernel tends to get ignored.
