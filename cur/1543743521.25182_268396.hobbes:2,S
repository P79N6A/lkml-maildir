You're right... the bug was introduced by my skb_header_pointer() changes.
Look at this:
	amp = skb_header_pointer(skb, dataoff,
				 skb->len - dataoff, amanda_buffer);
	BUG_ON(amp == NULL);
	data = amp;
	data_limit = amp + skb->len - dataoff;
	*data_limit = '\0';
It should just use the amanda_buffer always.
