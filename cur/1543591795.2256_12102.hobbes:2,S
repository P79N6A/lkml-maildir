Care to explain "duplicate MBR signature handling" in the GPT FAQ?
While describing the new-style partitions, Microsoft mentions that
Windows 2000 has a way to mark old-style ("MBR") partitions:
: 58. What happens if a duplicate Disk or Partition GUID is detected? 
: Windows Whistler will generate new GUIDs for any duplicate Disk GUID,
: MSR Partition GUID, or MSR basic data GUID upon detection. This is
: similar to the duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000.
: Duplicate GUIDs on a dynamic container or database partition
: cause unpredictable results.
Well, the way to test this would be with Windows 2000, two disks,
and a Linux rescue disk that has "dd" on it. See what gets changed
when the "duplicate MBR signature handling in Windows 2000" runs.
