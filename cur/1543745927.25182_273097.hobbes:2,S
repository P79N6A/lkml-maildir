Not if you build different kernels for quite some machines on a build 
system. It is neat then to use INSTALL_PATH and INSTALL_MOD_PATH to get 
the build output into target machine related directories for further 
automated processing.
What I just want to say is that, yes, set INSTALL_PATH (and 
INSTALL_MOD_PATH) whereever you want to point it to - as long as it is 
not already set.
