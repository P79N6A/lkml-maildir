Continuing as for some reason half of the letter went into limbo...
09-mousedev-drop-attribute.packed
        - drop __attribute__ ((packed)) from mousedev as we ca spare couple
          of bytes to get better code readability
10-i8042-platform-device.patch
        - make i8042 a platform device (instead of system) device so its
          ports have a proper parent
11-serio-platform-devices.patch
        - integrate ct82c710, maceps2, q40kbd and rpckbd with sysfs
          as platform devices so their serio ports have proper parents
12-serio-bus-default-attr.patch
        - qwitch to use bus' default device and driver attributes to
          manage serio sysfs attributes
13-serio-manual-bind.patch
        - allow marking serio ports (in addition to serio drivers)
          as manual bind only, export the flag through sysfs:
             echo -n "manual" > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serio0/bind_mode
             echo -n "auto" > /sys/bus/serio/drivers/serio_raw/bind_mode
14-serio-use-driiver-find:
        - use driver_find when doing manual binding, adjust refcounting as
          driver_find takes a reference.
I will not be sending individual patches as they have been posted couple times
already and I'd hate spamming LKML once again.
