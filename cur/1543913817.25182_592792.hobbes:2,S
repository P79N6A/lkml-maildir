Subject: [PATCH RFC 0/9] RCU: Preemptible RCU
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/10/213

Work in progress, still not for inclusion.  But code now complete!
This is a respin of the following prior posting:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/5/268
This release adds an additional patch that adds fixes to comments and RCU
documentation, along with one macro being renamed.  The rcutorture patch
has a modification to make it a bit more vicious to priority boosting
(though the current design relies on -rt latencies for much of the
priority-boost torturing effectiveness in this case -- run the test
in presence of CPU hotplug operations to get the same effect in -mm).
Next step is rebasing this to a more recent version of Linux.
						Thanx, Paul
