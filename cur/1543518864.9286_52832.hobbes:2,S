Hi,

Yes.

No.  We only have 1G permanently mapped.  We have a page information
database ("mem_map" in the kernel) which needs to fit in that 1G.  The
more pages you have, the more overhead we need to fit into the bottom
1G.  That imposes hard limits right now which prevent us going anywhere
near 16T in size.

No.  On Intel we have the above limitation, and on 64-bit hardware we
have other IO issues concerning PCI.  A lot of the core is ready, yes,
but there is still work needing done.
