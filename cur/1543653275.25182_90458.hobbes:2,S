| | 133). If unsure, say Y.
| |
| | This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
| | inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
| | The module will be called uhci-hcd.o. If you want to compile it as a
| | module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Do you have proposed text or (even better) a patch for this?
