Hey, that's not what I meant.  Sorry for the silly language.  I'm the
last one to argue in favour of a single big diff.  But all the driver
fixes are easily separatable, in fact benh probably still has all the
individual diffs for all the mac drivers.
What I meant is that the FB maintainer should try to get the existing
fixes merged before adding dubious features.
