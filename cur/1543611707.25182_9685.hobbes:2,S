Subject: IBM Thinkpad T21: Hotplugging of cdrom and floppy devices

Hello all,
I'm using actual 2.4.x-kernels with the laptop I mentioned in the subject.
When I put off my floppy-device (/dev/fd1) and put in my cdrom-device 
(/dev/hdc; both no pcmcia-devices) or vice versa, the kernel doesn't 
recognize this change. The change - LED of the laptop is blinking until 
I suspend the laptop for example with apm -s or with the keyboard Fn-F4 
and rewake it. After this "little sleep", the kernel suddenly knows 
about the new hardware and it can handle it.
I tested the hotplugging-feature of the kernel 2.4.x - but I couldn't 
get it working.
Is there any other possibility to give the kernel a chance to detect a 
hardware change without going through the suspend-mode? I mean, is there 
a piece of software, which does the same as in the wake-up-situation of 
the notebook after suspend?
Thank you for your advice,
Andreas Hartmann
