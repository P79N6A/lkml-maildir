Yes, as per the documentation.

generate-modutils.conf will do the right thing here, and unroll the
aliases.  And the README in module-init-tools says:
	4) If you are using devfs, copy modprobe.devfs to /etc
And modprobe.devfs gets it right.

Your patch only works for forwards references, not backwards
references.
There may be convincing arguments to adding support for recursive
aliases, but this isn't it.
Sorry,
Rusty.
