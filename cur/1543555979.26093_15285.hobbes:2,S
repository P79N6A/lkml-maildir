But this doesn't help this particular problem, I think. The problem is probably
not the in-memory cache, but the resource consumption caused by netscape
loading the pictures.
You can use ulimit (or pam) to set memory consumption limits for each process,
and that would usually do the trick (see /etc/pam.d/ and
/etc/security/limits.conf at least on RedHat).
Unfortunately, Netscape sends the images to the X server, so usually you will
see that Netscape's memory consumption stays fairly constant, while your X
server will start consuming lots of memory.   If you set the resource limits,
your X server will be the obvious choice for the OOM killer (I guess -
comments, Riel or Andrea ?).  I don't know of any good solution to this problem
other than just having enough swap space - after all, seriously, with today's
disks, who can't spare an extra few hundred megs (which would usually be more
than enough).
