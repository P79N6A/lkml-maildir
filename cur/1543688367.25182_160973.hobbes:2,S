I have seen several posts from you, but all in this vague, almost
information-free style.
It would be of interest if you described your actions and the results
in detail. Or if you gave explicitly the partition table that you
consider strange.
[If you only think about cylinder boundaries: cylinders do not exist,
and cylinder boundaries do not exist either. So that in itself does
not mean a thing.]
