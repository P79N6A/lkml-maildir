As I reported earlier (but appearantly unnoticed), on my Thinkpad A30p
(which uses the ICH3), keyboard and mouse don't work with the new input
layer when CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC is on, but I have no problems (except
my USB mouse) when I switch that off.

For me, the usb mouse stopped working with 2.5.25 in all configurations I
tried, the stick works without UP_IOAPIC. Unless the new input driver
is supposed to be a complete drop-in replacement for the old one, I still
assume that is a configuration error on my side.

Yup, Ed has this one on as well. Alexander, what about your systems?
