By numbers of groups worth? And full groups get free, unmixed and
filled by movable objects?

Moved to cron weekly here. And even normally it is only once a day. So
what if it starts moving some pages while updatedb runs. If it isn't
too braindead it will reclaim some dentries updated has created and
left for good. It should just cause the dentry cache to be smaller at
no cost. I'm not calling that normal operations. That is a once a day
special. What I don't want is to spend 1% of cpu time copying
pages. That would be unacceptable. Copying 1000 pages per updatedb run
would be trivial on the other hand.

1 is enough to prevent jittering. If you don't hold a group back and
you are exactly at a group boundary then alternatingly allocating and
freeing one page would result in a group allocation and freeing every
time. With one group in reserve you only get an group allocation or
freeing when a groupd worth of change has happened.
This assumes that changing the type and/or state of a group is
expensive. Takes time or locks or some such. Otherwise just let it
jitter.

That is the price you pay. To allocate 2MB of ram you have to have 2MB
of free ram or make them free. There is no way around that. Moving
pages means that you can actually get those 2MB even if the price
is high and that you have more choice deciding what to throw away or
swap out. I would rather have a 2MB malloc take some time than have it
fail because the kernel doesn't feel like it.

Thanks. I will test that out and see what I get on a few lustre
servers and clients. That is probably quite a different workload from
what you test.
