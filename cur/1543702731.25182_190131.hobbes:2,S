cpufreq is deactivated for all tests, but seems not to make problems...
ACPI --- Pow... never thought of that... ...But sync losses occour even if
my labtop doesn't even see the need for switching on the CPU fan. Anyway,
povray makes the CPU really hot, and doesn't make things worse...
...and the problem occours directly after startup, too... Don't think this
will be the problem,
