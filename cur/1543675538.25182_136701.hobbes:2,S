It sounds as if SCO did a diff against Linux and is claiming that any
sections of lines that match, line for line, are being claimed as
'stolen'. It worries me that the panel of 'experts' they are inviting
to 'see for themselves' are members of the media. How will they know
what they are looking at, whether the code is original or not, or whether
it was SCO who stole the code from Linux?
