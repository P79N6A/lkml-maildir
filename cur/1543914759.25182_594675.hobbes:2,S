Thanks Mike, I work on this and will until feel it is completed.
Distributed filesystem is a logical continuation of the whoe idea of
storing data on the several remote nodes - DST and FS must exist
together for the maximum performance, but that does not mean that block
layer itself should be abandoned. As you probably noticed from my mail
to Jeff, distributed storage was originally part of the overall
filesystem design.
