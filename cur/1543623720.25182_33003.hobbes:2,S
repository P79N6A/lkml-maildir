Yep.  The kernel restrictions on ClearCase are hideous.  Right now, AFAIK,
the newest supported kernel on RedHat 7.1 is RedHat's 2.4.9-6.  They ship
binary-only precompiled modules and blow up if you try to use an unknown
version.  If it doesn't blow up, you can only use it in a "restricted" mode
which disables dynamic views.

Good luck.  It's a royal pain to set up a development environment that does
not look like your production environment, especially when your dev servers
crash and lose all of their views and any un-checked-in files.
