Hi,
You have CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPCHAINS as a module, are you using ipchains
compatibility?
Try the patch at:
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/current-updates/linux-2.4.23-updates.patch
and see if that makes a difference for you.  It contains the ipchains compat
oops amoung other patches.
Regards
James
