Corisen,
RedHat 7.0's version of gcc, known as gcc 2.96, is incompatible with the 
kernel's code.  Preprocessor changes cause the problem you encountered.  It 
also has some defects in how it optimizes code that would cause the kernel 
to run incorrectly.
The 7.0 distribution includes an older version of gcc, known as kgcc (for 
kernel gcc), that compiles code correctly and can be used for kernel 
compilation.  Install the rpm and go for it!
