Just for info, I couldn't find any reference to KEY_WINDOW. Anyway, 
indeed, KEY_SCREEN is already used for "full screen" (although sometimes 
it's KEY_ZOOM :-/) so better not using it if something else is possible.

What about KEY_DISPLAYONOFF ? :-)
What should be its value? Would 239 be fine?

BTW, I'm thinking of implementing led support. However, there are two 
mechanisms for leds in the kernel: the "input layer" leds and the "full 
feature" leds. The laptops may have up to three leds: mail, wifi, 
bluetooth. The input layer has LED_MAIL but no wifi nor bluetooth. The 
led subsystem has the advantage of the very extensible "trigger" 
mechanism. Which of the subsystems would you recommend me to use?
See you,
Eric
