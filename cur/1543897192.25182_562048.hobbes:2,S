Yes. As for qrcu (see 
http://marc.info/?t=116484476500001
), I think it is easy.
First, we add "int interrupted" into struct qrcu_struct, then something like this
	long synchronize_qrcu_timeout(struct qrcu_struct *qp, long tout)
	{
		int idx;
		smp_mb();
		mutex_lock(&qp->mutex);
	again:
		idx = qp->completed & 0x1;
		if (unlikely(qp->interrupted)) {
			idx ^= 0x1;
			goto restart;
		}
		if (atomic_read(qp->ctr + idx) == 1)
			goto out;
		atomic_inc(qp->ctr + (idx ^ 0x1));
		qp->completed++;
		atomic_dec(qp->ctr + idx);
	restart:
		__wait_event_timeout(qp->wq, !atomic_read(qp->ctr + idx), tout);
		if (unlikely(!tout)) {
			qp->interrupted = 1;
			goto out;
		}
		if (unlikely(qp->interrupted)) {
			qp->interrupted = 0;
			goto again;
		}
	out:
		mutex_unlock(&qp->mutex);
		smp_mb();
		return tout;
	}
Of course, this needs some other changes to implement synchronize_qrcu() on top
of synchronize_qrcu_timeout(). I also think that this doesn't break

Looks like we can do something similar for srcu.
Oleg.
