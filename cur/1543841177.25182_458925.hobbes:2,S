Dear Friend, 
I write to you based on a request by an investor and his 
need for investment/funding in your country. My name is Mark Ferguson, 
a financial consultant and I work with a reputable financial services 
firm.
My company most times represents the interests of very wealthy 
investors. Due to the sensitivity of the position they hold in thier 
society and the unstable investment environment of their country, they 
evacuate majority of their funds into more stable economies and 
developed nations where they can get good yield for their money. 
I 
was recently approached by a Reserved Client, whom I had personally 
worked with a few years ago with a proposal.What he request is an 
individual such as yourself, who will be willing to receive money on 
his behalf abroad, and put it to good use for a period not exceeding 6 
years for a start.
The client has offered these terms:
1. 30% 
commission paid to me and my foreign partner of the total funds 
successfully evacuated. The funds in question are over 13.2Million 
USDollars.
2. The funds will be used by the foreign partner for six 
years as a loan without any interest. That is, you do not pay any 
interest on the money but you give the client 50% of all profits after 
tax that accrued from the use of the funds.
If these terms are 
agreeable to you, kindly let me know and I will provide you with all 
necessary information and procedures involved. 
Looking forward for 
your prompt response. 
Sincerely yours, 
Mark Ferguson.
