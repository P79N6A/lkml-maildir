Well it seems that fire-walling the SPAM servers is *not* a good idea.
They are persistant, gang up, and will not give up until they are
able to deliver the mail! When I firewall them, my network traffic
ends up being continuous SYN floods as every spam-server in the
country tries to connect. It doesn't do any good to set `ipchains` to
REJECT instead of DENY. They just keep on banging on the door.
This morning, there was too much traffic on our T3 link to use
a Web crawler, so I had to un-firewall my machine to get about
100,000 (maybe more) mail messages delivered and thrown away.
Procmail is throwing away everything as fast as it can. The
hard-disk LEDs are on continuously, and it takes about 20
seconds to log in. The machine has been eating SPAM mail since
7:00 this morning and it's now 10:15. Maybe, eventually, I
will be able to use my machine again.
To give you a hint of the size of the problem, my /var/log/messages
which logs sendmail activity is about 12 Gb in length. I truncated
it to zero this morning.
