I beleive this is ok for 2.6.17-rc1, but this breaks lockless
for_each_process/while_each_thread (I am talking about -mm tree).
Andrew, could you please drop these ones:
	task-make-task-list-manipulations-rcu-safe-fix.patch
	task-make-task-list-manipulations-rcu-safe-fix-fix.patch
Then we need this "patch" for de_thread:
-		list_add_tail_rcu(&current->tasks, &init_task.tasks);
+		list_replace_rcu(&leader->tasks, &current->tasks);
 ...
-		list_del_init(&leader->tasks);
Currently I don't know how the code looks in -mm tree, I lost the plot.
Oleg.
