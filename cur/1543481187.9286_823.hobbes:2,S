	This has also bothered me for some time, but I haven't had the
spare time to fix it.  Ideally, what currently is the amd_model() function
should be renamed get_ext_cpuid() or something like that.  Then a new
amd_model() can be written to do a call to the get_ext_cpuid(), and
contain all the AMD specific code.  Including Alexey's write-allocate
patch, and the sep flag (bit 10) fix for the K5 step 6, plus the L1 cache
stuff if anyone wants to code it.  It's pretty easy to do this, and it
keeps the MediaGX happy.  I don't have an AMD K6 around that's why I
haven't done it myself ;)
	Cheers,
