<<Hi!
SUSPEND_NOTIFY/SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE/SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN are not adequate
for suspend-to-disk.
When doing suspend to disk, I need to stop all devices, do atomic copy
of state, and restart them to be able to write memory image to disk.
What do you think about this? [I do not think SAVE_STATE is what
typical driver will do. IMO typical driver will just do nothing on
suspend and reinit device on resume. This reflects it. For drivers
that need to save/resume, I propose they do it in STOP/START.]
Take long look at suspend-to-disk. It is pretty tricky.

Following operations are needed for suspend/resume:
STOP_DEVICE
	brings device into silent state. (Called from process context,
	interrupts enabled.)
Silent state:
	* device may not do any DMA
	* when someone asks for operation, device may BUG()
START_DEVICE
	brings device back from silent state. Driver state (everything 
	in memory; local variables, kernel state, everything) might be
	lost between STOP_DEVICE and START_DEVICE. (Called from process
	context, interrupts enabled.)
DEINIT_DEVICE
	bring device into such state that BIOS and/or operating system
	is able to initialize the device.
INIT_DEVICE
	initialize device from state after poweron to silent state or
	working state. If you bring it to the working state, make sure
	your START_DEVICE handler can survive that.
What is this all good for?
Normal boot:
* kernel initializes devices as it allways did and boots
* user presses Ctrl-Alt-Del
* DEINIT_DEVICE is called
Suspend to RAM:
* kernel initializes devices as it allways did and boots
* user asks for suspend-to-ram
*   STOP_DEVICE is called
*     DEINIT_DEVICE is called
*     everything but RAM is powered down
*     INIT_DEVICE is called
*   START_DEVICE is called
Suspend to disk:
* kernel initializes devices as it allways did and boots
* user asks for suspend-to-disk
* kernel stops all userland tasks
* kernel frees enough memory
*   STOP_DEVICE is called
*   interrupts are disabled and atomic copy of memory is done
*   START_DEVICE is called
* kernel writes copy of memory into swapspace
*   DEINIT_DEVICE is called
*   machine goes powerdown
* another (!) kernel initializes devices as it allways did and boots
* machine realizes it is resume, not normal boot at late stage of boot
*   new kernel reads copy of old memory
*   STOP_DEVICE is called in new kernel
*   interrupts are disabled and memory is atomically copied back
*   START_DEVICE is called in old kernel
* old kernel is up and running
