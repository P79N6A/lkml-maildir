Hi all,
I'm running fairly standard x86 hardware (VIA chipset, athlon, etc.)
The system was quite stable running 2.4, but since upgrading to 2.6 
I've had three complete system freezes.  Mouse and keyboard frozen, 
can't ping, nothing at all in the logs.  I was hoping to submit a bug 
report but alt-sysrq didn't work.  So, would people like me to 
investigate further (and if so, how?) or shall I just ignore it?
