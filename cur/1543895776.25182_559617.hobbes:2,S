What i _feel_ is that "some" (vendors) think that even if they utilize
existing resources what is open and keep what they have done, completely
closed (ie, they use existing infrastructure as a building block, but
they keep the stuff completely closed, in many cases the argument with
regards to IP is not even valid, as looking at symbol tables etc we find
some badly copied code from other parts etc, sewn together. The logical
thought what i have is that they do this to avoid a competition in the
short run) -- and they feel that they are doing things in a quite legal way.

Trying to force _anything_ on _anyone_ doesn't achieve anything, other
than just anger.
We at the worst could of course argue that users should avoid going for
that specific product, but i don't know how much that would work. I say
thus, because legally it would not be possible to challenge such vendors
globally as rules and regulations are different with different
governments and or countries. In such a case a tit-for-tat doesn't work
at all.
If all the people were to agree on common aspects, there wouldn't be any
wars at all ?

If v3 defends the definition better, that would be a better use case,
don't you think so ? (But i don't see how v3 also will defend the
definition across international territories, in such a case what i
outlined, since have been bitten by this many times, even talking to the
black sheep which never helped)
