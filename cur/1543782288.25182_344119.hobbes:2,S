Hi all,
I'm new in this list and I have some problems exporting symbols in a
module to see them in other module.
In the module I want to export the symbol I do:
tList list;
EXPORT_SYMBOL(list);
I compile it and install without any problem.
And in the module I want to use them I declare list with "extern"
prototype:
extern tList list;
When I compile the module It says me that list is undefined, and I don't
know what I am doing wrong.
Does anybody know what is happening? 
Maybe a makefile example would be appreciated... 
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
        Sergio
