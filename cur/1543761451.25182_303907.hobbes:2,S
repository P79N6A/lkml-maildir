Thanks!  Its nice to finally have an open source tool for sucking
down the latest and greatest directly from bk.  Thus far the tool
is working perfectly at fetching source trees and at updating
them when new patches are applied.
One minor nit.  The name for the 'update' tool is a bit too
generic...  For example old (old) linux systems have an
/sbin/update util for flushing buffers, and I have plenty of
'update' scripts lying around doing odd jobs.   Perhaps a rename
to 'sfioup' might be a good idea, as that is sufficiently obscure
there is little chance of a naming collision.
