Thanks for the suggestion, but sata_nv is not built modular in my 
current kernel, so "no can do" at the moment
(However, if some expert REALLY thinks this will fix things, I will 
CERTAINLY recompile and give it a go)
As I said before, it all works for some time (a day or two) before it 
crashes with the current kernel & no "S.M.A.R.T.". With my current setup 
I have always had the time to fully rebuild my disk-array before a new 
crash. - In the case of 4 disks attached to the nvidia controllers 
(disregarding the disks on other controllers), this means that the 
sata_nv-driver / controllers alone have read at least 750GB and written 
250GB of data before the crash (with no resets working) - soft reboot 
fixes everything. -  I'm pretty confident that this is a driver issue.
As Tejun Heo <htejun@gmail.com> writes "the whole controller seems to 
have went down at once and it's not even IRQ routing problem - resets 
are failing."
The error-messages / crash-symptoms were the same with SMART enabled and 
the original CentOS5-kernel, except that with that setup, the crashes 
were much more frequent.
Any help?
