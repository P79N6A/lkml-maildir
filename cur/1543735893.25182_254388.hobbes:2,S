Good to know. You've seemed a bit busy :)

The delay was added just in case. The cards I have here work fine 
without it. I just thought adding a small delay might avoid problematic 
cards later on. Seems to be a few of those.

Looks ok. You sure we don't need to put all cards into an idle state 
before issuing a new SEND_OP_COND? I haven't studied how the MMC layer 
is called in detail. Can a rescan be done while a card is in a selected 
state?
