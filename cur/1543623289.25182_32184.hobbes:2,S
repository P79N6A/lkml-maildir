First mail with MTU 9000, tg3 in both ends:
test8:/usr/src/LMbench/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu# ./lat_tcp 129.241.56.160
TCP latency using 129.241.56.160: 146.3539 microseconds
However, there seems to be a problem with the bw_tcp-tool, cause it just
hangs, trying to strace it won't gimme me much usefull info about why it
hangs either. (it worked like a charm with 1500 MTUs).
Ok, right now I just tried the nttcp tool (which I used to benchmark this
driver in an earlier posting), it seems like there's a bug with MTU 9000 and
TCP:
[this is UDP, works like a charm]

[cause here it hangs]
I can still stop the program with CTRL-C, so I dont' know what it is,
someone enlighten me, please? :)
