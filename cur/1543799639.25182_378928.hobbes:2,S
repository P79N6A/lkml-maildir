So what happened to what the comment 10 lines above your patch says?
        /*
         * The lock in wake_up_all() is a crucial memory barrier after
         * the list_del_init() and also before assigning to q->lock_ptr.
         */
On PPC64, the spinlock unlock path has a sync in there for the very
purpose of adding the write barrier. Maybe the ia64 unlock path is
missing something similar?
