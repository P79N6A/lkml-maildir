If memory is considered to be unreclaimable then actions should be
taken at mmap() time, not later! Rejecting mmap() is the only way to
limit user in unreclaimable memory consumption.

Thank you.

Yes. I just wanted to keep all the things together.

Among all the kernel-code-intrusive patches in BC patch set
kmemsize hooks are the most "conservative" - only one place
is heavily patched - this is slab allocator. Buddy is patched,
but _significantly_ smaller. The rest of the patch adds __GFP_BC
flags to some allocations and SLAB_BC to some kmem_caches.
User memory controlling patch is much heavier...
I'd set priorities of development that way:
1. core infrastructure (mainly headers)
2. interface
3. kernel memory hooks and accounting
4. mappings hooks and accounting
5. physical pages hooks and accounting
6. user pages reclamation
7. moving threads between beancounters
8. make beancounter persistent
