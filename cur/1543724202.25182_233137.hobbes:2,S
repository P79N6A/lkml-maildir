OK, now that I am considering this problem,  I am trying to figure out
what problem we are trying to solve.
By reading your email, I gather that you have a single threaded
application which is doing an mmap on a file as a MAP_PRIVATE mapping.
The memory area is then handed to a library which may modify some pages.
You want to decide after the return if you had success and thereby
control the writing of the updated data back to the file.  Because of
the size of the file, doing a second mapping and comparing/copying pages
is unreasonable and you would like to only modify the pages that have
actually changed.
If that is not what you are trying to do, please give me a similar
description of _WHAT_ you are trying to do and not the _HOW_ you think
the kernel can make this easier.

This is a different way of thinking of copy-on-write.  I believe you
are thinking of the time when there are two processes sharing the page.
When one process takes the write fault, the page is copied and the by that
process and the other process becomes the exclusive owner of the page.
