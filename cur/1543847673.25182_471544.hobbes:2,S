The only way for it to fail if __GFP_IO is set, is if someone kills the
process.
Note that since the NFS client itself will flush out all dirty data to
disk prior to calling invalidate_inode_pages2, the only thing we're
trying to do here is to avoid races while invalidating those pages.

Maybe. Do any of the current callers care? NFS should be quite happy
with the patch that is currently in Andrew's tree.
