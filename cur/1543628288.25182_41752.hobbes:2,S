Then use BK over email then (to submit a patch of your last change set for 
example you would do "bk export -tpatch -r+", and the receiving end does a 
simple "cat emailmessagetext | bk receive" and that's it done.
Obviously you haven't looked at bitkeeper... (-;

ps. You better be prepared to accept very large emails if you want to send 
a whole linux kernel repository by email though! Never mind if you are 
using bitkeeper or just a tar ball!
