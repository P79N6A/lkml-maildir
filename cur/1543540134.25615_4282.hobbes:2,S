In my BIOS there is a specialised interrupt handler in Int 0x1C
I need to know if linux overrides that interrupt or mengels with it somehow.
There is a external watchdog on my system and it gets triggered in that
interrupt.
BTW I have been posting questions on A20 and ports 0xEE and 0xEF, the A20 is
solved and the other problems turned out to be the external watchdog that
does not get its ticks. (and can't be disabled).
Have a nice weekend.
