The SuS rules require write checks
resource limit
	if that stops all of the write
			SIGXFZ
			EFBIG
	else short write
!O_LARGEFILE and > off_t limit
	if that stops all of the write
			SIGXFZ
			EFBIG
	else short write
over fs limit
	if that stops all the write
			SIGXFZ
			EFBIG
	else short write
truncate has to honour the resource and fs limit. ftruncate also checks
the O_LARGEFILE limit.
Finally some OS's actually let you F_SETFL O_LARGEFILE.
I can put all that in the VFS so I did (right now the ext2 size calculator is
wrong but thats proof of concept detail). Just need to shift if over from
ext2/file.c
