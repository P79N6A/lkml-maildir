From their page I understand they get the ip-number via bootp only. 
I like the kernel bootp very much, and use it to let fresh servers boot
from a floppy disk and mount a full featured Linux system via nfs so I
can fdisk the disks and cp files (Debian base, drivers and rescue) for a
quick installation of Debian (or debug of course, of just to turn a
windoze into a Linux workstation with only a floppy disk).
I hope bootp will stay in the kernel, and I can't see why it won't or
shouldn't.

PS, works fine with kernel2.4
