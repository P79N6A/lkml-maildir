We are running the tests with the following mother board.

Its a very nice box with 2 independent 64/66 PCI buses.  
Capable of 2x503MB/sec, using your logic ;)
Regardless, the 640MB/s number was computed without considering the PCI bus
limitations, or the dual port nature of the base 160MB/sec nature of the
Adabptec SCSI-39160.

Realistically, we are looking for a max throughput of about 320MB/sec with 4
adapters with enough drives attached.
