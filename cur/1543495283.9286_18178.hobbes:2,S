Hi!
It seems to me that with new kernels rdtsc is not being used unless
cpu type is set to 586/TSC+. This is difference from old kernels which
used rdtsc whenever it was available. This is why my badboy exploit
stopped running on my home computer.
I think that wherever rdtsc is used is pretty vital piece of
information, and I think it really should be available. (I was running
my computer for pretty long time thinking rdtsc is enabled... You
guessed it it was not.)
