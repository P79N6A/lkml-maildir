Why would you, or the "Desktop User Joe" using Torvalds-advertised KDE,
care about how many modules are loaded?
Splitting code up to make things more modular is A Good Choice most
of the times. There is, however, one point in which you have reason:
if the overall modular structure is bigger than a mono one, then it's
indeed "complicated".

jackd does not count - ALSA works without it.

I'd rather have libasound segfault rather than my kernel oopsing, in case
someone forgot a NULL check.

AFAICS, OSS does not do mixing at all in its current state.
