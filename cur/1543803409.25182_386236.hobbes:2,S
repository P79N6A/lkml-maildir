 WHAT IS LINUX?
 
-  Linux is a Unix clone written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with
-  assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net.
-  It aims towards POSIX compliance. 
-
-  It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged
-  Unix, including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries,
-  demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory
-  management and TCP/IP networking. 
+  Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by
+  Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across
+  the Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance.
+
+  It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix,
+  including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand
+  loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management,
+  and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.
 
   It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
   accompanying COPYING file for more details. 
 
 ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?
 
-  Linux was first developed for 386/486-based PCs.  These days it also
-  runs on ARMs, DEC Alphas, SUN Sparcs, M68000 machines (like Atari and
-  Amiga), MIPS and PowerPC, and others.
+  Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or higher),
+  today Linux also runs on (at least) the Compaq Alpha AXP, Sun SPARC and
+  UltraSPARC, Motorola 68000, PowerPC, PowerPC64, ARM, Hitachi SuperH,
+  IBM S/390, MIPS, HP PA-RISC, Intel IA-64, DEC VAX, AMD x86-64, AXIS CRIS,
+  and Renesas M32R architectures.
+
+  Linux is easily portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures
+  as long as they have a paged memory management unit (PMMU) and a port of the
+  GNU C compiler (gcc) (part of The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC). Linux has
+  also been ported to a number of architectures without a PMMU, although
+  functionality is then obviously somewhat limited.
