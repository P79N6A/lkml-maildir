Subject: [patch 09/13] io-accounting: report in procfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
Add a simple /proc/pid/io to show the IO accounting fields.
Maybe this shouldn't be merged in mainline - the preferred reporting channel
is taskstats.  But given the poor state of our userspace support for
taskstats, this is useful for developer-testing, at least.  And it improves
the changes that the procps developers will wire it up into top(1).  Opinions
are sought.
The patch also wires up the existing IO-accounting fields.
It's a bit racy on 32-bit machines: if process A reads process B's
/proc/pid/io while process B is updating one of those 64-bit counters, process
A could see an intermediate result.
