David,
I had CONFIG_ATMEL_TCLIB enabled, but not TCB_CLKSRC and
TCB_CLKSRC_BLOCK=0. With all those options, I finally have HRT
functionality. But, strange thing is that jitter of my little example
(get time, sleep 1ms, get time, show the difference) is around 250us.
Maybe this is normal for this architecture?
System is (as noted on rt.wik site) very slow with NO_HZ option enabled.
Thanks again!
