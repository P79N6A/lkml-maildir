Also bad for the user since now the vendor can no longer supply
updated firmware to fix bugs or otherwise improve the device. Also,
the vendow has the problem that devices that get returned for repair
or similar can't easily be updated software wise. For the vendor not
to be able to update the box creates a lot of problems for both the
vendor and the end user.

I am fairly confident that if too much software switches to GPLv3
we'll see a lot of businesses move to BSD or proprietary software.
That means *we* lose bigtime.
