Hello!

It is interesting. Are you sure? This bug was known since ~2.1.70 or so.
The fast fast fix is to add to get_stats() in 8390.c:
	struct ei_device *ei_local = (struct ei_device *) dev->priv;
	unsigned long flags;
+
+	if (ei_local == NULL)
+		return NULL;
    
	/* If the card is stopped, just return the present stats. */
	if (dev->start == 0) 
		return &ei_local->stat;
The fix is incomplete, actual fix requires changing invalid
cleanup_module() inside drivers. F.e. in the case of smc-utra it is:
		if (dev->priv != NULL) {
			/* NB: ultra_close_card() does free_irq + irq2dev */
			int ioaddr = dev->base_addr - ULTRA_NIC_OFFSET;
-			kfree(dev->priv);
-			dev->priv = NULL;
-			release_region(ioaddr, ULTRA_IO_EXTENT);
-			unregister_netdev(dev);
+			/* The first thing to make in destroying any device
+			   is to unregister it. Before the device is unregistered,
+			   the kernel is allowed and WILL access it. It even
+			   may open it.
+			 */
+			unregister_netdev(dev);
+			kfree(dev->priv);
+			release_region(ioaddr, ULTRA_IO_EXTENT);
		}
Again, only author of the driver (or anyone knowing enough about it)
can predict, is it OK or not to leave dev->priv!=NULL during unregister.
If it is not OK, the driver is broken.
