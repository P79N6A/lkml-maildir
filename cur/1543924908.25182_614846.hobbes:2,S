It isn't unexpected. If an atomic allocation doesn't have enough memory,
it kicks off kswapd to start freeing memory for it. However, it cannot
wait for memory to become free (it's GFP_ATOMIC), so it has to return
failure. GFP_ATOMIC allocation paths are designed so that the kernel can
recover from this situation, and a subsequent allocation will have free
memory.
Probably in production kernels we should default to only reporting this
when page reclaim is not making any progress.

You can reduce the chances of it happening by increasing
/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes.
