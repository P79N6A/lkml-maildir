There were no immediate plans to put that back in linux/cpu.h.  It is 
now defined and used in drivers/base/cpu.c.  cpu_devclass is registered 
with driverfs (err..  sysfs) there.  If you need it, you should be able 
to reference it...  just stick an extern in your file.
Check out the thread '[patch] Core sysfs Topology 2.5.45'.  These are 
the patches that modified the sysfs topology system.
Cheers!
