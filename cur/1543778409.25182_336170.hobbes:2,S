I'm afraid that I may have accidentally solved my problem ;-)
I've upgraded my Gigabyte GA7-VAXP motherboard's BIOS from release 7VAXP.F11 
to 7VAXP.F15, and it seems the problem is gone !
The strange thing is that now, cat /proc/interrupts shows that both uhci_hcd 
and ehci_hcd use the same IRQ (21) :
[root@totor etc]# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:     569004    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       2107    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:       1589    IO-APIC-edge  serial
  7:          2    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
 14:       4615    IO-APIC-edge  ide4
 15:       4624    IO-APIC-edge  ide5
 16:      29033   IO-APIC-level  nvidia
 18:       7684   IO-APIC-level  eth0, eth1
 19:      28049   IO-APIC-level  ide0, ide1, ide2, ide3
 21:       7128   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd:usb1, uhci_hcd:usb2, uhci_hcd:usb3, 
uhci_hcd:usb4
 22:       5969   IO-APIC-level  VIA8233
NMI:          0
LOC:     568946
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
...and then, the system feels happy. I've played around with USB devices of 
all speeds in all sockets, and there are no "irq 21: nobody cared!" messages 
anymore...
Still, high-speed USB devices seem to work only in the motherboard integrated 
USB sockets, otherwise I get some "usb 1-4: device not accepting address 26, 
error -71" messages, but this isn't an issue for me, and might be a cable 
problem as you said...
So it seems that the BIOS upgrade fixed the IRQ issue (or masked it ?).
What is weird is that, from the Gigabyte's BIOS list, I wouldn't have expected 
this upgrade to fix this, as their changelog from F11 to F15 only says:
F11: AMD Barton CPU support (2500+/2800+/3000+) 
F13: Fixed BIOS flash utility(flash8xx) can't be used issue
F14: Support new AMD Duron model8 CPU (64K L2 Cache FSB 266)
F15: Added AMD Sempron CPU support
So this BIOS upgrade was just a desperate move on my part ;-)
Well, anyway, things look much better here now...
Natalie, if you would like me to try some of your VIA patches to check them 
out on my system, I would be glad to help in my turn...
Cheers, and thanks to all of you again for all your precious help.
