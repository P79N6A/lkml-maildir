Subject: [APPENDIX PATCH 04/13] block: export blk_end_io
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/15/420

This patch exports blk_end_io() so that request-based dm can use it
to complete their clone.
Request-based dm can't use blk_end_request interfaces for their clone,
since their callback is called again.
So another request completion interface which has no stacking hook
is needed.
