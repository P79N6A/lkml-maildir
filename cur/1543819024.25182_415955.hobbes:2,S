I think that anon pages are shared, copy-on-write, between parent and
child after a fork().  If no exec() and no task writes the page, the
sharing can become quite extensive.  I encountered this testing the
migrate-on-fault patches.  With MPOL_MF_MOVE, these shared anon pages
don't get migrated at all [sometimes this is what you want, sometimes
not...], but with '_MOVE_ALL the shared anon pages DO get migrated, so
you can have races between a faulting task and the migrating task.
