Progress!!!  I built a 2.6.21.1 kernel with a 1MB dmesg buffer,  
almost all of the locking debugging options on (as well as a few  
others just for kicks), a VLAN debug #define turned on in the net/ 
8021q/vlan.h file, and lots of extra debugging messages added to the  
functions in vlan.c.  My initial interpretation is that due to the  
funny order in which "ifdown -a" takes down interfaces, it tries to  
delete the VLAN interfaces before the bridges running atop them have  
been taken down.  Ordinarily this seems to work, but when the  
underlying physical ethernet is down already, the last VLAN to be  
deleted seems to hang somehow.  The full results are as follows:
The lock dependency validator at startup passes all 218 testcases,  
indicating that all the locking crap is probably working correctly  
(those debug options chew up another meg of RAM).
ifup -a brings up the interfaces in this order (See previous email  
for configuration details):
lo net0 wfi0 world0 lan lan:0 world
ifdown -a appears to bring them down in the same order (at least,  
until it gets stuck).
Attached below is filtered debugging information.  I cut out 90% of  
the crap in the syslog, but there's still a lot left over to sift  
through; sorry.  If you want my .config or the full text of the log  
then email me privately and I'll send it to you, as it's kinda big.
I appreciate any advice, thanks for all your help
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
This first bit is the "ifup -a -v -i interfaces":

And then it hangs; ugh.  I think the disable-the-RX function callback  
is making things die horribly somehow, but I don't know how.  At that  
point these messages start every couple seconds, of course:

I managed to dump a lot of info with /proc/sysrq-trigger before I  
rebooted the box:

As the system continues to run more processes get stuck in the  
netdev_run_todo function waiting for vconfig to release a lock, while  
vconfig appears to be waiting in the kernel for its interfaces to  
lose reference counts, which they can't do as long as vconfig holds  
random locks.
