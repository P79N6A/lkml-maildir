I finally got kubuntu dapper to boot and run quite nicely, but the added 
command line arguments to the boot added about 6 new arguments.  That 
allowed me to run gparted and although it didn't act like it did, it 
did shrink the ntfs partition down to about 27GB, and got rid of the 
other 2 partitions.  I've already made the backup dvd's of course.  XP 
is still happy in the reduced space.  But kubuntu subscribes to the Joe 
Sixpack theory a bit too firmly, not even supplying an accessable 
shell, just the run thingy, so I just burnt the FC5 x86-64 dvd iso, and 
k3b says the checksum is fubar but every disk it said that about has 
passed the disks own mediatests (so far).
So tomorrow, after church, and if the height of the yard doesn't call me 
first, I'm gonna try installing that puppy.
