x86_64: setup saved_max_pfn correctly
2.6.19-rc4 has broken CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP support on x86_64. It is impossible 
to read out the kernel contents from /proc/vmcore because saved_max_pfn is set
to zero instead of the max_pfn value before the user map is setup.
This happens because saved_max_pfn is initialized at parse_early_param() time,
and at this time no active regions have been registered. save_max_pfn is setup
from e820_end_of_ram(), more exact find_max_pfn_with_active_regions() which
returns 0 because no regions exist.
This patch fixes this by registering before and removing after the call
to e820_end_of_ram().
