Please don't drop cc's etc.  Just use reply-to-all.
For John:  this means that you need to load libata with this option:
atapi_enabled=1
So if you build it into the kernel image, add this to the boot option:
  libata.atapi_enabled=1
or if you load it as a module, just add:  atapi_enabled=1
or you can edit the source file and change the variable to 1,
but that's the least preferable way IMO.
