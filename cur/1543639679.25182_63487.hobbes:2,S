Have you tested when you actually seek over the size of a block device?
Stupid standards aside: what is the purpose of this?  blockdevices won't
grow bigger if you seek beyond them..
Did any Linux implementation ever follow the standard (as you rewrite
reverse)?  What's the behaviour of other unix systems when seeking
beyond the end of block devices?
