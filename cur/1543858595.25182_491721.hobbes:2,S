OK the example driver was a bad example.  A very bad example.  Writing a
driver with UIO does involve writing _some_ kernel code, just not much.
Some of the kernel code you do have to write is the bit of the interrupt
routine which shuts the device up.  UIO doesn't really move the
interrupt handling to userspace, more it moves the bottom-half work to
userspace.  If you are using UIO, a prerequisite is probably that your
actual interrupt handler code is trivial, all work can be done in this
form of userspace bottom-half.
The example didn't show that, the docco shipped with the UIO patches does.
        Ben.
