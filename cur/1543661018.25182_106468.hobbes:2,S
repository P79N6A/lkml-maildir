He does not send them there. I know it is a no-no to forward his writings to
the list, but I thought it may be of use to others, too (and he did not shoot
me for it so far ;-)

Ok, after reading your thoughts and re-reading the bios stuff I found and "DRAM
alignment" option, and voila:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=2048MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x100000000 (4096MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0x200000000 (8192MB), size=8192MB: write-back, count=1
reg03: base=0x400000000 (16384MB), size=16384MB: write-back, count=1
reg04: base=0x800000000 (32768MB), size=32768MB: write-back, count=1
reg05: base=0xfb000000 (4016MB), size=   8MB: write-combining, count=1
The table got obviously shorter and significantly "better". It seems the
onboard VGA stuff is now mapped out of the normal DRAM range. 
I must admit though that some of this bios looks fishy, because now I cannot
find the original DRAM caching entries any longer, no matter what I switch on
or off (you know those "write-back, write-through" stuff).
Now I think one can really be content with this setup. Thanks a lot to Mark and
Dave.
In case anyone is interested, this is an Asus TRL-DLS mb.
