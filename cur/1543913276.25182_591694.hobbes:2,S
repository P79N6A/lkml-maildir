    Have you tried FC forums? This list is about the linux kernel, not
about distros. The name, "Linux Kernel Mailing List" should have rang a
bell (or even two).

    I don't know why are you login as root frequently (so as to annoy
you having to type a password), but since you're not... wise enough to
know that this list is about the kernel and not a distro, I recommend
you AGAINST login as root.
    Moreover, since you don't know how to disable root password, I don't
think is wise you log in as root AT ALL.
    This said, if you want to avoid having a password for root (probably
a cracker someday will thank you for that), go and edit /etc/passwd (or,
if you prefer security through obscurity, which may well be the case)
/etc/shadow, and leave the password field for root empty. It's the
second field, after the first colon.

    Oh, so you're just a troll. Well, in fact half a brain is needed to
log always as root, so I won't discuss that. And given that I took the
time to write the instructions so you can hang yourself, I'll send this
message even if it is obvious you're a troll.
    Happy trolling, and if someone suggests you to get a life, don't
listen, trolling is much funnier! As you may already experienced,
getting a life can be very hard, but trolling is easy.
    And to the list, sorry for feeding the troll, but it looked furry
and adorable O:)
