I applied the things from your last patch that we could apply, but some
symbols can't be made static because the parts of codebase are shared with
userland and Linux 2.4 where they need to be global.  I'll go through
this patch again and will apply the parts that we can do - there seems
to be lots of new stuff vs last time.
