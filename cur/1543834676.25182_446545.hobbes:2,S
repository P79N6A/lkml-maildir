No. Now that I think about it, adding that extra
macro is just wrong even if temporary.
The real fix is equally simple, but in 2.6.18-rc
it is intertwined with other more intrusive changes.
Let me make a new separate patch that does things
the right way, which is simply removing the list
head while processing the list so two instances
to not trip over each other. I would have done so
earlier, but I've been insanely busy with multiple
work related deadlines (lame excuse I know).
I should post something tomorrow afternoon.
