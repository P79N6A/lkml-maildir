I've noticed some odd (and annoying) behavior within the last week.
I first noticed it with 2.3.49, then again with 2.3.99pre3.
When I first boot it runs fine, but then after a while (not sure
how long) ps, qps, procinfo, kill [processname] all hang.
I can still ls dirs in /proc, but if I attempt to ls certain process
entries in /proc it will hang.  I'm not sure where the bug lies
but thought I'd share it.  (by hang I mean that ls hangs and ties up
the shell - I have to kill the xterm with alt-f4 or go to another
vc to work.)
