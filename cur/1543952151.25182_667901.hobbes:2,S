A general comment: the raw clock doesn't need any adjustments, so updates 
don't have to be done that frequently and you can move most of that logic 
into second_overflow().

IMO that's really a clock property, so this belongs in the clock 
structure.
(Some day we may want to have multiple active clocks for various purposes 
and thus export multiple raw clocks.)

You don't really have to use clock->shift as a scale, thus simplifying the 
shifting here (e.g. by using NTP_SCALE_SHIFT).
I'm thinking about doing this for e.g. xtime_nsec as well.
