Hello all;
After quite some effort investigation and discussion on the crossgcc
mailing group.
I decided to bring my problem here.
I am trying to compile a kernel module for a mips32 chip.
I am having problems with the <asm/uaccess.h> (asm-mips/uaccess) inline 
assembly routines for both get_user() and put_user().
Both of these generate inline assembly. In specific a line:
   j    2b
My mips compiler does not like this very much and complains loudly:
   /tmp/ccw6NzZv.s: Assembler messages:
   /tmp/ccw6NzZv.s:128: Error: Cannot branch to symbol in another
   section.
This program seems to compile FINE on x86 since the x86 assembly seems
to have been re-written and put in arch/i386/lib/getuser.S and the
functions __get_user() in <asm-x86/uaccess.h> seems to be obsolete.
I have included a sample module using one of these calls to demonstrate
the problem. I have tried several different cross-compilers and one
native mips compiler all giving the same complaint on the "j  2b"
instruction.
I am definitely NOT a kernel module expert, but have done my best to
track down the problem and give a sample program.
Any help would be much appreciated.
Cheers,
      -=chris
