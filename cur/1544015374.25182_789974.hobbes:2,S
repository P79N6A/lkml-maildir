The way it is laid out is:
kernel/softirq.c:
	int __init __weak early_irq_init(void)
	{
        	return 0;
	}
kernel/irq/handle.c:
	#ifdef CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ
	:
	struct irq_desc **irq_desc_ptrs __read_mostly;
	:
	int __init early_irq_init(void)
	{
		:
		nr_irqs = ...
	#else
	:
	struct irq_desc irq_desc[NR_IRQS] __cacheline_aligned_in_smp = {
	:
	int __init early_irq_init(void)
	{
		<don't set nr_irqs>
So I don't see an x86 specific early_irq_init.
Since NR_IRQS is defined in a lot of different ways (in different places),
I think I'll have to do something like;
arch/x86/include/asm/irq_vectors.h:
	
	#define max_nr_irqs(nr_cpus)	\
include/linux/irqnr.h:
	#ifndef max_nr_irqs
	#define max_nr_irqs(unused)	NR_IRQS
	#endif
Would that work for you?
Thanks,
Mike
