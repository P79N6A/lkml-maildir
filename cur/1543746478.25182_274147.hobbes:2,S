Hello,
I'm porting a device driver from 2.2.14 to 2.6.7 and I got some problems 
doing this...
one of them is the following:
I know that a call to interruptible_wait_on puts a process into sleep 
state and that wait_event_interruptible does the same. But the 
difference is that wait_event_interruptible needs a condition to pass to 
wake up the processes. I do not need that mechanism since I wake up the 
processes at other places inside my driver with wake_up_interruptible 
calls. So how do I get a function similar to interruptible_wait_on where 
no condition is needed using kernel 2.6?
Thanks a lot and please CC me, 'cos I haven't subscribed to the LKML yet.
Kind regards,
Hendrik
