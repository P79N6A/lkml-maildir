Why is this so? schedule() runs RCU_qsctr(task_cpu(prev))++;
whether it is called directly or via preempt_schedule.

Technically, I think preempt can still reduce maximum latency
depending on whether the time between explicit resched checks
is greater than the (small) scheduling overhead that preempt
adds.
But yeah, that would be in the noise compared with long
preempt-off regions.
I'm not sure about applications, but maybe some soft-realtime
things like audio software benefit from a lower average latency
(I don't know).
