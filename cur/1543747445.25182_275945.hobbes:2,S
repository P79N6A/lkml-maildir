Hello,
I had made some tests with mkinitrd , I deleted /boot/intird-2.6.7.img
and booted (without renaming the /boot/intird-2.6.7.img.old I have to 
intird-2.6.7.img).
I use this intird-2.6.7.img image in boot (ext3 is not part of the kernel 
image).
(I am working with Fedora with 2.6.7 , and with grub).
So when booting I get the mesages:
....
/intrd/intird-2.6.7.img
error 15: File Mot Fount
...
what should I do ? can I use a Fedora boot diskette and then
mount the boot partition and rename the file ? (the intird-2.6.7.img.old is 
, as
I said,under boot)
How can I do this mounting?
(If I remember well , a boot CD like KNPOIX does not have write 
permissions.)
Regards,
John
