Hey, if the poster knows his mail client is broken, nothing prevents him
from attaching the patches (so that they don't get mangled) and at the
same time inline them for an easy review. People who review patches won't
bother about spaces or tabs when you indicate to them from the beginning
that the patch may have been mangled.
