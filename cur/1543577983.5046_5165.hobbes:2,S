I haven't had time to test this patch, but looking over the changes to
the acenic driver I have to say that I am quite displeased with the
way the changes were done. I can't comment on how authors of the other
drivers which were changed feel about it. However I find it highly
annoying that someone goes off and makes major cosmetic structural
changes to someone elses code without even consulting the author who
happens to maintain the code. It doesn't help that the patch reverts
changes that should not have been reverted.
I don't think it's too much to ask that one actually tries to
communicate with an author of a piece of code before making such major
changes and submitting them opting for inclusion in the kernel.
