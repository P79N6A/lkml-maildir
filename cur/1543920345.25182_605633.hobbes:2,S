The steady state of a system that is heavily and usably swapping but
not thrashing is that all of the pages in RAM are in the swap cache,
at least that used to be the case.

Right.  But swapping heavily has been a viable mode of operation
and that the vast gap in disk random IO performance seems to have
hurt significantly.
It be very clear is used to able to run a problem at little below
full speed with the disk pegged with swap traffic, and I did this
regularly when I started out with linux.

There is a bit of truth in the fact that there is less need for
swapping now.  At the same time however swapping simply does not
work well right now, and I'm not at all certain why.

It's a hard call.  The I/O time for 1MB of contiguous disk data
is about the I/O time of 512 bytes of contiguous disk data.

Really?  Not just the pushing of unused stuff into swap.

You probably have a point there.
