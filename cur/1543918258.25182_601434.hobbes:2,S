You should really read and understand the code you are arguing about :-/
In the 2.6.22 scheduler, there was a p->time_slice per task variable 
that could be manipulated. (Note, in 2.6.22's sched_yield() did not 
manipulate p->time_slice.)
sysctl_sched_latency on the other hand is not something that is per task 
(it is global) so there is no pending timeslice to be "cleared" as it 
has been suggested naively.
