I've downloaded, configured (make oldconfig using
.config from 2.4.21), and compiled kernel 2.6.0-test5,
but it just refuses to boot completely.
It prints:
drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered new driver hid
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: v2.0:USB HID core driver
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
and just stops booting.
Which configuration option(s) did I miss?

P.S.  Thanks in advance!
