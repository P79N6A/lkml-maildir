There is no K7 specific implementation. It's the same as the Intel MSRs.
From the comment in the file:
        case X86_VENDOR_AMD:
            /*
             *  AMD K7 machine check is Intel like
             */
            if(c->x86 == 6)
                intel_mcheck_init(c);
            break;
regards,
Dave.
