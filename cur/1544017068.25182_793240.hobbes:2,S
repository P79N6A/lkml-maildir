Ok, I'll remove css_is_populated(). (I alread removed it in my local set.)
BTW, because we can access cgroup outside of cgroup_lock via CSS ID scanning,
I want some way to confirm this cgroup is worth to be looked into or not.
*And* I think it's better to mark cgroup as NOT VALID in which initialization is
not complete.
And it's better to notify user that "you should rmdir this incomplete cgroup"
when populate() finally fails. Do you have  idea ?
