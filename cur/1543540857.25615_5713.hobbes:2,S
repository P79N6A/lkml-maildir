   SysRq don't work here over serial console (has never worked
   ok). Phillip Rumpf solved my problems. I thought that you had the
   patch.  This is the patch actualized to test6-pre1. 
Oh, that patch.  Yes I have it, and it's been queued to Linus once
already (he dropped it; I'll be resending it shortly, after I forward
port the patches to pre6-1).
This patch fixes the problem where the sysrq won't work if the console
is printing some printk message (since it masks the break key).
However, if the console is printing some message via printk, the break
key should work fine.    So saying that SysRq "doesn't work" is rather
overstating the case.  That's why I didn't recognize which patch you
were referring to.
