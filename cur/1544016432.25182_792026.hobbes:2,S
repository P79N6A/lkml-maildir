It's used by the pr_*() macros in <linux/kernel.h>.
Since commit d091c2f58ba32029495a933b721e8e02fbd12caa ("Add 'pr_fmt()' format
modifier to pr_xyz macros."), this is the new way to have a common prefix in
all printed output.

Ok, removed.

For compatibility with crypto_comp, we also need an alloc function for both
compress and decompress, so that makes 3 alloc functions.
That would also solve the issue where there's hardware support for e.g.
decompression, but not for compression.

I guess you want to use the flags to indicate compress/decompress/both?
Unfortunately I'm still struggling to fully understand the type/mask handling,
so I would appreciate it if you could give me a hint how to handle that.

OK.

I assume "length" is the size of the passed params, so the algorithms can
return -EINVAL if they're passed the wrong size?

I'll look into the netlink formatting...

OK, I updated all pcomp_alg operations to take crypto_pcomp pointers instead of
crypto_tfm pointers.

I tried to do this, but stumbled across a dependency problem: as
crypto_alloc_tfm() needs a pointer to crypto_pcomp_type(), crypto_alloc_pcomp()
can no longer be static inline, and must be moved to crypto/pcompress.c.
However, pcompress can be a module, while testmgr (which uses
crypto_alloc_pcomp()) seems to be always builtin.
Ah, CRYPTO_MANAGER2 has to select CRYPTO_PCOMP. OK.
Thanks for your review!
