Trees are O(log n) for insert/delete, with a high constant of
proportionality (ie. there can be quite a lot of work to be done even
for small log n).  Trees also occupy more memory per node.  Hashes are
O(1) for insert and delete, and are a _fast_ O(1).  The page cache needs
fast insert and delete.
