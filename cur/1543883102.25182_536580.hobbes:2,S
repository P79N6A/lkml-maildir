I can imagine that the dvb oops bugfix got held back to avoid some
noise with dvb developers who claimed that they didn't get notified
about how that patch got into the v4l-dvb repository (it didn't get
reviewed by these people for weeks because it simply got ignored and
some of them were aware of that)
On the other side if I read bugreports like the following one:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-dvb
%40linuxtv.org/msg23028.html
(My Nova-T 500 crashes quite regularly. My machine has been running for
about a week and in that time has had 5 oopses.)
It doesn't solve the Nova-T disconnects, but it at least solves that
the machine doesn't go down when this happens till the driver gets
fixed.
I think it would have been nice to get that patch into it
