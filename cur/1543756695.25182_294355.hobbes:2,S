Desktop performance tomorrow will want realtime audio AND video. 
Think simultaneous record and playback of multiple high-definition
video streams. There's a demand for this; my company already sells it.

The pro will want to do his work on a stock desktop system. More
importantly, the hobbyist will want to do exactly what the pro is
doing on the same system.

I'm very suspicious about being able to rip out RT-LSM once it's
introduced. See devfs. And I think the adoption barrier thing is a red
herring as well: the current users are by and large compiling their
own RT-tuned kernels.

Rlimits are already the favored tool for dealing with the classic UNIX DoS:
the fork bomb. Turn off process limits, tada, locked up box.
