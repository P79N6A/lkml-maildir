I got this far, and the first thought that popped into my head was:
"Wow.  This might actually win on a UP or small MP (2-15 CPU).  But the
lock contention on a big 512-CPU machoflops box is likely going to *suck*".
For that matter, my quick eyeballing of the code, although it doesn't *find*
any race conditions, doesn't convince me there's any protection taken to make
sure there aren't any.  Is there some subtle algorithmic trick I'm missing
to ensure Nothing Bad Can Happen?
