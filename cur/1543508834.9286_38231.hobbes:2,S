If you go back and look at the thread, you'll find that I was the first to
mention a version number. There was, of course, the vague context of Linus
having recently rejected the RAID 0.90 code for 2.2. In that context, it
would be entirely reasonable for someone to suggest "Since Linus rejected
this for 2.2, let's put it in 2.3." Therefore I assumed when the thread
began that it was about 2.3. But some posters seemed to be thinking 2.2,
some 2.3, and some didn't seem to care which. That was why I went back to
carefully check whether a version had been indicated anywhere in the
thread.
