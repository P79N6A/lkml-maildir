I did make some noise, probably over a year ago now, but I guess it fell 
through the cracks or no one else could duplicate it.  And my expiry on this 
list means any and all such messages have been expired for several months.

I have two, both very early models sold by Radio Shack but they have been 
hanging on the pegs except for when I take roadnav with me on a long trip.

Maybe that is what I was seeing?  ATM runing on 2.6.24 final. Just for grins I 
fired up a 'cat /dev/hideaw0 | hexdump -v' and I'm seeing traffic, mostly 
from the motion sensor, but because hexdump makes a 16 byte line out of one 
byte, and may display that byte anyplace in that 16 byte buffer, I can't tell 
what is right and what is wrong even though I am familiar with the x10 
protocol.  Do we have another such tool that will output only those bytes 
actually received as they come in?  Something that prints the hex value of 
the byte, and then issues a newline to the screen?  Or some way to ship the 
$00's to /dev/null so hexdump ignores them?
