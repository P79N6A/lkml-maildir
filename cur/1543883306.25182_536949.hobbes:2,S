There was Caglar Onur too but he said he will redo all the tests. I'm
not tracking all tests nor versions, so it might be possible that some
of the differences vanish with v7.
In fact, what I'd like to see in 2.6.22 is something better for everybody
and with *no* regression, even if it's not perfect. I had the feeling
that SD matched that goal right now, except for Mike who has not tested
recent versions. Don't get me wrong, I still think that CFS is a more
interesting long-term target. But it may require more time to satisfy
everyone. At least with one of them in 2.6.22, we won't waste time
comparing to current mainline.
