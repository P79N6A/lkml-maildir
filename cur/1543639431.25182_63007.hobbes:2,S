Sorry, this connection is too subtle for me.  I see why we want to do
this, and in fact I've been researching how to do it for the last few
weeks, but I don't see how it's related to the atomic kmap path.  Could
you please explain, in words of one syllable?
While I'm feeling disoriented, what exactly is the deadlock path for a
write from a mmaped, not uptodate page, to the same page?  And why does
__get_user need to touch the page in *two* places to instantiate it?
Also, how do we know the page won't get evicted before grab_cache_page
gets to it?
