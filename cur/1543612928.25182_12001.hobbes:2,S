Those can be changed without screwing up user code. You need to
be very careful about what you put in /proc, because user apps
will come to rely on whatever you choose.
Look at what happened with signals in /proc/*/stat. They were
originally reported as "%lu", just like you did. Then the kernel
was extended to support more than 32 signals on 32-bit hardware.
The format was briefly changed to be 16 hex chars, but this
broke lots of stuff. So now /proc/*/stat just reports the low
numbered signals as it did before, and /proc/*/status has the
rest of the signals.
So let's predict:
Around 2.5.42, IBM will have 60-way x86 or 80-way ppc64.
Then the kernel will be hacked to report a hex string of
arbitrary length, and user apps will die left and right.
Somebody will then hack things back to decimal, reporting
only the low sizeof(long)*8 processors in /proc/*/stat.
Any additional processors may be found as a hex string in
/proc/*/status, with the /proc/*/stat data useless on a
system with very many processors.
