gcc version 2.96-ia64-000717 snap 001117 - works for me doing cross
compile from ia32 to ia64.  Anybody adding #ifdef, please include this
version, oh and also include the version of gcc on the latest Redhat
ia64 beta, and the version of gcc on the latest Turbolinux ia64 beta.
Don't forget to include a check for cross compile, querying the local
rpm will not work in cross compile mode.
On second thoughts, forget about #ifdef.
