Yes, that was exactly the thing I tried to do. In my case some sort of
bookkeeping
how many IO's where mapped (to a certain path) and how many came back.
My assumption first was, if I am restoring the old pointers before I call
the original
function it should work.
After running into problems this patch was just my quick hack to try out
whether this
was the only place that I did not think of. I wouldn't insist on the exact
way to do it,
but since it worked for me, I thought it might be worth to discuss (or
even be useful
for other people... ;-)).
