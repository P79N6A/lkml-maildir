<sigh>.  I did do it one at a time.  I replaced the module loading
code as stage I.

It works for me.  This is becoming an FAQ, but I thought the code was
obvious: eg. insmod execvp "insmod.old" when it detects an older
kernel, and "make install" moves insmod to insmod.old etc. if
insmod.old doesn't already exist.

I'm sorry if I'm feeding the patches to Linus too slowly for you, but
you know where to find them, I've posted the URL often enough.  It
hasn't even hit a release yet, so I wasn't worried.
I implemented an in-kernel module loader, implemented the linking code
for 6 architectures, re-implemented all the module cruft cleanly on
top of it, and kept it uptodate through all the changes in Linus'
tree.
And you wonder why I held back fleshing out the implementation of
modprobe, until (if) the code was in the kernel?

I rewrote module.c to make it an in-kernel linker so insmod was 20
lines.  And you think I should have re-implemented races in the
loading and unloading stages too, so I could remove them in a future
patch?
What an odd concept!
Rusty.
