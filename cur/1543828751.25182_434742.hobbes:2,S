The old 16550 OUT2 output (MCR:3) used to be a truly
independant control output that was commonly used
with an external gate to connect/disconnect the
interrupt request to the ISA bus.
Reading the TL16C752B datasheet, it seems pretty clear
that this gating is performed internal to the device.
MCR:3 is no longer an independant, general purpose I/O.
The result is the same though: If you dink around with
MCR:3 you could disable interrupts in either case.
So I don't see this as more or less of a problem than
other 16550 type devices.
