Who was talking about the Z80? The WCS was added to the
Pentium line after the Patent issues were resolved.
Search on "writable control store" to see the many papers
and developments.

One of the "latest and greatest" such machines was made by Transmeta
(a.k.a. Linus` home when he first came to the US. The Crusoe, etc.,
could emulate just about anything because its microcode was deliberately
replaceable with even microcode that was architecturally different.
