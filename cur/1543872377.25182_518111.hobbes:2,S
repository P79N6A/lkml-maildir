Look in arch/x86_64/io_apic.c. That is where most of the work happened.
If you can extract that patch series for a backport more power to you.

    [PATCH] x86_64 irq: Safely cleanup an irq after moving it.
    The problem:  After moving an interrupt when is it safe to teardown
    the data structures for receiving the interrupt at the old location?
    With a normal pci device it is possible to issue a read to a device
    to flush all posted writes.  This does not work for the oldest ioapics
    because they are on a 3-wire apic bus which is a completely different
    data path.  For some more modern ioapics when everything is using
    front side bus delivery you can flush interrupts by simply issuing a
    read to the ioapic.  For other modern ioapics emperical testing has
    shown that this does not work.
    So it appears the only reliable way to know the last of the irqs from an
    ioapic have been received from before the ioapic was reprogrammed is to
    received the first irq from the ioapic from after it was reprogrammed.
    Once we know the last irq message has been received from an ioapic
    into a local apic we then need to know that irq message has been
    processed through the local apics.
