Hm, how about a simple trick:
you write a "remote resource access" filesystem and do
mount -t remote_resourse -o access_control.conf 192.168.1.1 /mnt/server1
then you "just" write a library to overload open, close, read, write, 
ioctl,... do
export LD_PRELOAD=remote_libc.so
and then
mount /mnt/server1/hda1 /usr/local
In /mnt/server1/ you could have interesting things like
mouse0
dsp0
or even
network0
node0/cpu0
node0/ram0
Simple, sin't it?:-)
Thanks
Guennadi
