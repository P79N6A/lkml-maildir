Subject: 'git gc' always run, on old kernel repo?

In order to apply a kernel patch diff'd against an older kernel, I ran
	git checkout -b tmp v2.6.23
	git-am --signoff --utf8 /g/tmp/mbox
The patch applied successfully, but each time I run this, it starts an 
automated 'git gc' run...  even if there is nothing useful to gc:

IMO there is a broken hueristic in there somewhere...  I regularly run 
'git gc' on my repos...
