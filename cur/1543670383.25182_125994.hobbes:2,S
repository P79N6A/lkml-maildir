Great.  Now we have 20 copies of asm-foo/loopinfo.h.  Couldn't you
just have asm-generic/loopinfo.h and each of the arch-specific
pieces just include that?

Even better, have specific sized types (__u16, __u32, __u64) for the
fields, so there is no ambiguity (e.g. sparc64, or 32-bit code running
on x86-64).
