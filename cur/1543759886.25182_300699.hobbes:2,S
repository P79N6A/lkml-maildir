This is somewhat complicated by the fact that the existing apps are
already running and instead need promotion. Then we run into problems
lie set_rlimit doesn't want to work on other processes and issues with
sched_setparam on other threads, etc.
Part of me wants to say, well you designed it wrong. You should have
planned a setuid launcher for the rt threads. But at the same time,
the rlimits thing seems like a reasonably clean way to give RT access
to users, and still allows for protect watchdog processes..

Does the mlock rlimit not already address the Oracle problem?
