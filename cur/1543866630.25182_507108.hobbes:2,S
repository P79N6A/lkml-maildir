That's a fair concern, although I was trying this as part
of evaluating how much someone could hose a system
if we let them mount arbitrary FUSE servers.  And the
answer is: they could make it completely unusable,
requiring reboot.
I ran a later test that printed how deep it got into
the file tree and it was only a few hundred thousand
if I recall correctly.  A determined attacker might even
manage to do this in a normal file system.
But sure, it's not a common case.  ;-)
