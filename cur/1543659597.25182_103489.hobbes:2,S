I just thought I'd mention, if anyone has any spare time or needs a
project, that it would be really nice if there was a more modular
interface for this stuff. Right now we have MPS code and ACPI code
messing with the same data structures (!!) and it is bug-prone and
confusing. Every time I try to fix anything that touches my area (ACPI
IRQ routing) I am paralyzed by fear that any change I make will break
something, because it is a big, swampy bog of code.
