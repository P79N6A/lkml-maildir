As discussed with Jim on linux-fbdev-devel this patch fixes the vt / X 
switching problem. We still don't know why starting with 2.4.11 I have to 
switch CONFIG_FB_PM2_FIFO_DISCONNECT off to restore colours / images. Jim 
says it is doubtful that this option brings any optimisations at all, 
still, it is a bit worrying, that something that worked with earlier 
kernels stopped working now. I traced this breakage down to the patch to 
pm2fb.c after 2.6.10-rc2. Jim wanted to try to reproduce this problem with 
my fb-geometry / colour settings, but I haven't heard from him since then, 
Jim?
Thanks
Guennadi
