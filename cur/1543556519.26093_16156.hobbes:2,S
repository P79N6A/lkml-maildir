Sorry for coming back to this late. I am working on different projects and
some high priority tasks eat up my time...
First of all, it seems that we disagree a little bit on the impact this problem
has. I discovered it running RT-Linux.
Not setting DAR when an address is not found in the TLB as it happens
on the MPC860 with the dcbz (& similar) instructions means that
you must not use these instructions on any system that does not keep all
of its address mappings in the TLBs permanently, because there is no way
for the TLB replacement algorithm to figure out the fault address.
Most of the PowerPC cache manipulation instructions are executable in
user mode, i.e. they may be present in any program / library that is ported
to MPC860. On linux, executing such a program may occasionally cause it to
mysteriously "segfault". Portions of the LINUX kernel are also affected.
If need more pages of memory than there are TLBs in the 860, I have to
scan all the software I intend to use on this machine for the cache instructions
and eliminate them (with some impact on performance, of course).
Me (and I'm sure there are many others affected by this problem although
they might not know it - after all, it was pretty hard to track down, for me too)
would certainly apreciate you to try to figure out a solution.
Regards, Till Straumann.
