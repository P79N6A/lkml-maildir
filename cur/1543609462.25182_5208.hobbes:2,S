Hello out there!
Doing a X-patch between, ehmm, the pre-patches 2 and 3, I noticed
that a call to sa1100_irda_init() will be added in
patch-2.4.15-pre3 TWICE. This *may* work, but I think this isn't
quite in the intention of the inventor :-). So Linus/Alan please 
watch out...
It's in the file linux/net/irda/irda_device.c:
The following will be twice there after pre3
#ifdef CONFIG_SA1100_FIR
	sa1100_irda_init()
#endif
