Possibly your involvement was that short.  I rather doubt the code was 
written that quickly...  I first found out about it on the 12th from the 
rt5 patch you posted about 2pm.  Was there an earlier email?

Cleanliness can easily be obtained with a CPP macro.  I am not sure what 
the right answer is here.  I have heard complaints on the 64-bit thing 
on lkml WRT the work John Stultz is doing.  Also, it is real easy to 
abstract all the operations into CPP macros and choose 64 bit or 
timespec at compile time.

I agree, the ktimers code looks clean.  I am concerned that all the 
issues be addressed, but time will shake that out.

Agreed, I just wish we could see it a bit earlier...

Timers do, but I am not so sure of sleeps.  Seems a lot of them are 
interrupted.  Still, as I said in the note to Thomas, I don't have a 
real answer here.  The hashed tree I used in HRT instead of the cascade, 
did eliminate the cascade.  The hashed tree is faster for small N and, 
by changing the hash bucket size, we can easily make N<4k or so small. 
For larger N, the rbtree or some such seems right.  As I said in the 
note to Thomas, I am NO fan of the cascade.

Interested in a hashed list.  It is rather easy to do and does NOT 
cascade.  It is an O(N/M) list for inserts, same as what there now for 
deletes and nearly the same for the run timer code.  It takes away all 
the cascade stuff so it will eliminate a all of that code.  Oh, "M" is 
the number of buckets and can easily be configured at compile time.
