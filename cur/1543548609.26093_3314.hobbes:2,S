So? I have one of those letters in my name as well, doesn't mean I put
it in the From line or in the code that I write. Or do you want us all
to start using a compiler and editors that will understand full UTF8
so everybody who use non roman character sets have their names
displayed correctly in the comments of the code?
The kernel is written in C, C is in ASCII so whats the problem?
