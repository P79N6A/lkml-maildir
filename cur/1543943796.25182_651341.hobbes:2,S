ok, on a second thought: kgdb_{get|set}_mem() is _only_ used to validate 
and set the software breakpoint (int3). And i think kgdb correctly 
restricts that to kernel-space addresses only - you can typo an address 
down into user-space and overwrite user-space memory and not know what 
hit you ... [you can still explicitly touch user-space memory, but that 
has to be done intentionally]
So to reduce the confusion i've removed these functions and open-coded 
the probe_kernel_*() functions into kgdb_validate_break_address() and 
kgdb_arch_set_breakpoint().
all other places already use probe_kernel_{read|write}. (Now, there are 
a few stray TASK_SIZE checks still, i'll double check them and convert 
them to access_ok() checks.)
btw., based on your previous comment about alignment, i found another 
function that used weird alignment checks, kgdb_hex2mem():
	if (count == 2 && ((long)mem & 1) == 0)
		err = probe_kernel_write(mem, tmp_raw, 2);
	else if (count == 4 && ((long)mem & 3) == 0)
		err = probe_kernel_write(mem, tmp_raw, 4);
	else if (count == 8 && ((long)mem & 7) == 0)
		err = probe_kernel_write(mem, tmp_raw, 8);
	else
		err = probe_kernel_write(mem, tmp_raw, count);
	return err;
}
I just converted it to:
	return probe_kernel_write(mem, tmp_raw, count);
which looks _a lot_ cleaner.
