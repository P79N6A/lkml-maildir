   Alan, actually i wanted to tell you about other place:
from dmabuf.c:
        /*
         * Now loop until we get a free buffer. Try to get smaller buffer if
         * it fails. Don't accept smaller than 8k buffer for performance
         * reasons.
         */
    ===>  _here_ is a dead-loop  <===
        while (start_addr == NULL && dmap->buffsize > PAGE_SIZE) {
                for (sz = 0, size = PAGE_SIZE; size < dmap->buffsize; sz++, size                dmap->buffsize = PAGE_SIZE * (1 << sz);
                start_addr = (char *) __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC|GFP_DMA, sz);
                if (start_addr == NULL)
                        dmap->buffsize /= 2;
        }
      Solutions:
        1. make it accept 0-order allocations
        2. make CONFIG_SOUND_DMAP not a config, but the only option   
cheers, Sam
