They are different. Your input class represents userpsace interfaces, my
input class represent middleman class devices. If you remember, input
core looks like this:
                                     evdev (/dev/input/eventX devices)
				    /
    hardware			   /
    device	-------- input_dev - mousedev (/dev/input/mouseX,
    (serio port,		   \           /dev/input/mice
     USB port)			    \
                                      joydev (/dev/input/jsX devices)
Your input class is fine (except for its name as it uses the same name
that input core was/is using for notification about new instances of
input_devs), but it represents different point in object hierarchy, as
it represents /dev/input/{mouse|event|js}X objects.
Your class devices are useful to properly create device nodes and
probably set up userspace applications to use new input devices. My
input_dev class devices are useful so hotplug would load proper input
handlers (joysdev, mousedev) to create your class devices.
I hope it explains things a bit...
