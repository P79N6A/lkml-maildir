FYI, I have a patch for 2.6 in my out queue which deletes the
option/full_duplex code (including the part below) entirely. Nobody
complained when it was unusable for the longest time (kind of fixed
recently), and the code is still a mess. People using 2.6 should use
ethtool _if_ they need to force media, because that works.
So as via-rhine maintainer, I recommend applying to 2.4 and leaving
2.6 as is.
FWIW cleaning up all the printed messages in via-rhine is on my todo
list.
