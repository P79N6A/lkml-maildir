An interesting patch.
I expect that the next one will include options for setting
the pitch and duration of the beep issued by the kernel when
there is a beep on a different console.
But really, if you want to know when messages appear on a log console,
then something like
#!/bin/sh
# call: chvt_on_event N
N=$1
VT=/dev/vcs$N
OLD=/tmp/.chvtoe$$
NEW=/tmp/.chvtoe$$x
cat $VT > $OLD
while true; do
        sleep 1
        cat $VT > $NEW
        if ! cmp -s $OLD $NEW ; then 
                mv $NEW $OLD
                chvt $N
        fi
done
would do.
Add parameter checking and removal of temp files on exit.
Replace the chvt $N by an echo ^G if you only want a beep.
A C version would be a single page of code.
