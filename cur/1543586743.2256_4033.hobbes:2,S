Can we call vmalloc() or get_free_pages() from scsi low-level driver 
(HBA driver) ? The reason why I am asking is because, I am calling
vmalloc from scsi low-level driver and I tried this on 2.4.2 on
ia32 as well as ia64 and on both the systems, it is hanging.
on ia64 it happens everytime whereas on ia32 it happens intermittently. 
In case of ia32, I had watchdog enabled. So, on ia32, it detects LOCKUP
and generates call trace. I am yet to try get_free_pages().
TIA,
-hiren
