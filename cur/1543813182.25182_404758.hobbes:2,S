Hi,
I grepped through the latest ML digests and didn't see any mention of
these patches recently.  I was wondering what the general opinion was on
potentially merging them.  They are both hardware support patches.  I
asked about the Debian kernel team maintaining them of instead
linux-kernel, but met with a lack of response there.
First is bigphysarea:

This is necessary for hardware which doesn't support scatter gather DMA.
It is non invasive since it only becomes activated when the user
supplies a kernel cmdline argument.  I've tested the latest version and
it works fine.
Also, I'm wondering if it is possible to include ACPI DSDT-in-initrd
patch on ACPI-supported platforms (i386, x86-64 and ia64 AFAIK).

This saves a user from having to rebuild the entire kernel when his
firmware DSDT either has known bugs, or he is in the process of
debugging it.  In fact it would have saved me a whole lot of time this
week.
Note that this is different from the DSDT-append-to-initrd approach that
was discussed previously.  I think it is a better design now, but
curious about your thoughts.
Thanks,
