I tried 2.2.0-pre8 + knfsd-981204 (no kernel patches) and had nothing
but problems.
1) amd host automount from a remote linux box.  This is OK.
2) Previous mount was RO, so I edit exports and change to RW.
Now exports has two entries:
/
/mnt/cdrom
The cdrom is currently not mounted.
Now I kick kexportfs -a.
Now the remote gets stale NFS filehandle.  I can't fix it.  I reboot
it.
Now the linux remote host automount only mounts the /mnt/cdrom, not /!
The local linux box says:
Jan 20 10:29:03 nbeckerpc mountd[370]: export request from 139.85.24.52 
Jan 20 10:29:03 nbeckerpc mountd[370]: authenticated mount request from pacpc3.hns.com:1023 
Jan 20 10:29:03 nbeckerpc mountd[370]: getfh failed: Operation not permitted 
Jan 20 10:29:03 nbeckerpc mountd[370]: authenticated mount request from pacpc3.hns.com:1023 
The getfh failed: must be the problem.
I reboot the remote linux box again, but the problem persists.
I don't see any problem when using host automount from a solaris box.
Anyway, I've had enough at this point, and go back to user-mode nfsd
:(
