Hi there,
Yes ncurses is in my path and my other kernel's menuconfig works fine
here are the messages
Avenger:/usr/src/linux-2.2.12wh# make menuconfig
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
make -C scripts/lxdialog all
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.12wh/scripts/lxdialog'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.12wh/scripts/lxdialog'
/bin/sh scripts/Menuconfig arch/i386/config.in
Using defaults found in .config
Preparing scripts: functions, parsing....................................done.
Your kernel configuration changes were NOT saved.
So was that a bug in 2.3.20 and ncurses ?
Regards
	Avenger
