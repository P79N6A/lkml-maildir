There is something wrong then...

Debian does:
force=""
fix="-a"
spinner="-C"
fsck $spinner $force $fix /
if [ $? -gt 1 ]
then
   echo "fsck failed..."
   ...
   /sbin/sulogin
   reboot -f
fi
which would catch return value '2' or any combination of 2 with anything
else. But fsck returns 1 - File system errors corrected. I just added 
check for $? -eq 1, doing immediate reboot in such case in 
/etc/init.d/checkroot.sh.
But I must admit that I did not checked whether 'system should be rebooted'
bit was not generated by e2fsck, or whether it was dropped by fsck wrapper,
or whether there is some addon patch in Debian fsck package.
System is debian unstable, currently using (e2)fsck 1.30-WIP, 30-Sep-2002.
