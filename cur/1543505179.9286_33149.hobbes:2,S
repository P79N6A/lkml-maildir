Hello,
I am new to this mailing list.
I am having RH6.0 system with SCSI facility.
I am trying to install one patch on the 2.2.0 kernel. I am going according to the procedure of kernel installation and compilation. All the things works fine. Even at the end the new initrd image for 2.2.0  is made and I make necessary changes in lilo and do 'lilo -v'. THen when I reboot the machine it fails telling that:
VFS: Kernel panic: Unable to mount on 8:5
and the machine hangs here.
Can any one point out where the exact problem is?
THank YOU,
Awaiting for reply
