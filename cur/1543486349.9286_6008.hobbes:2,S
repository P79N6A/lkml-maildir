I think all you have to do is:
        int flags = 1;
        ioctl(fd, FIONBIO, &flags);  /* Make non blocking */
        flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL);
        flags |= (FNDELAY|FASYNC);
        fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags);
	fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, getpid() ); /* Send signals to me */
... and it will work (no typos are checked).
