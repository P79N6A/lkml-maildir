Hi David:
Well our IA64 "mem=" is used in efi_memmap_walk.  We could change the 
name to "max_address=".  The X86 "mem=" takes effect before the bootmem 
allocator is initialized.  My patch eliminates memory before
mem_init frees all bootmap memory.  My proposed patch doesn't have the 
same functionality as X86 "mem=".
thanks,
Bob
