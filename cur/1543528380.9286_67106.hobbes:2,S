Great!  Now getting a nice 16-17meg from 2.3.47 + that fix; I haven't
looked at .48 yet.
Because you asked ;) Here's the numbers for 2.3.45+fix and 2.3.46+fix.
All tests were done in the order given, with no activity between.
2.3.45 + patch
Throughput 15.1465 MB/sec (NB=18.9332 MB/sec  151.465 MBit/sec)
Throughput 17.4895 MB/sec (NB=21.8619 MB/sec  174.895 MBit/sec)
Throughput 18.6803 MB/sec (NB=23.3504 MB/sec  186.803 MBit/sec)
Throughput 17.4141 MB/sec (NB=21.7676 MB/sec  174.141 MBit/sec)
2.3.46 + patch
Throughput 16.4924 MB/sec (NB=20.6155 MB/sec  164.924 MBit/sec)
Throughput 18.0024 MB/sec (NB=22.503 MB/sec  180.024 MBit/sec)
Throughput 17.6604 MB/sec (NB=22.0755 MB/sec  176.604 MBit/sec)
(interesting how the numbers increase for each run... probably not
relevatnt to real life though)
Well, the elevator dosn't seem to do any harm to dbench!  At least on my
machine, which makes me very happy to see.

Fabulous :)

I will get 2.3.48 ASAP and start hammering on it, but it's looking very
solid here.  Thank you all for your great work!
