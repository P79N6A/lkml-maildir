It does not rename ethX to the "next free" one, but to a _persistent_ one.
If it were a "next free" thing, then removing a card would shuffle all
your eth around again (and invalidate your iptables rules at the same
time, to note).

Remember that persistent names also need to provide means for
hot-pluggable devices. Say your eth0 was a wireless, then you surely would
_not ever_ want that on removal of eth0, all other cards step one down
(eth1,eth2,ethN->eth0,eth1,ethN-1). Unfortuantely, I think it is hard (if
not that, then it's a lot of code) to distinguish coldplugged vs
hotplugged devices.

This is easy. Edit /lib/udev/rename_netiface to always hand out "nicX"
regardless of whether the input device was ethX, trX, raX, wlanX or
whatever.

Note that /dev/sda is not persistent either.

See above - make rename_netiface use nicX. (Symlinks don't exist for
netdevices.)

I prefer nic10 directly over having a dual. You'd be totally lost
of syslog showed eth0 (from klog) and nic10 (from userspace).
