I think that it is unavoidable. Either you can browse network resources,
through SAP, NDS, DNS, SLP, bindery - and you also disclose
informations - or you cannot browse network and users will get angry
from typing 80 characters FQDN names... 
You can limit it by removing [Search] right for [Public] from your NDS - 
and I believe that it is only correct solution. Of course every NDS server
must be able to tell to [public] address of at least one other server 
nearest to [root], as client must be able to find where r/w replica
resides - and because of you know that there is [root] object in every
tree, you can find also [root] owner IP/IPX address. But if even knowing
of address of server can kill your network, you should already firewall
everything out.

Yeah. They forgot to note that after blocking port 524 nobody
can connect to server from outer world. They could say in less
words that Netware and IP are not on same boat ;-) I think they
should fix buffer overflows and possible abends in their NCP engine,
and issue warnings about not giving [Search] rights to [Public]
instead of blocking whole world from Netware servers.
BTW, in our tree not-logged-in object does not see anything, except
few objects which have explicitly granted visibility for [public].
But maybe that I misunderstood their information... If they are
talking about that information learned through SLP/SAP/NDS are
available through SLP/SAP/NDS, I do not see anything wrong with it.
If hacker can ask this server, it could also ask directly to source
of that information, unless your server is also serving as firewall
(and if it is, you should visit filtering section in FILTCFG.NLM...)
