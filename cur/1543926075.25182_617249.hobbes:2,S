I chose my wording carefully though.  A preemption point is
more than just a small region where preemption isn't allowed.
It's one of those where preemption is *INVITED* ...
Now, in the RT case, I believe the rationale for inviting
preemption when dropping a lock is largely related to the
way priority inversion is handled.  When lock contention can
block higher priority activities, dropping the lock must
be able to trigger the relevant activity switch.
... and the raw spinlocks don't support that machinery,
while "normal" spinlocks become inversion-aware mutexes.

As in the $SUBJECT case, I'd say.
Although another point is related to "trivial":  the data
is being protected through an operation too trivial to be
worth paying for any of that priority logic.
