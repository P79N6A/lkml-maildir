> Couldn't the cxacru instance pointer to the proc_read function be set to NULL before unloading?
The problem is reads that started (on some other CPU) before you started shutting things down
(eg: but setting this to null or whatever other method you like) and only finish after you have
finished shutting things down.  Or rather, never finish at all because the code they are executing
has been deleted from the kernel, causing an Oops.  This is not our problem: we can't do anything
about it: remove_proc_entry needs to be fixed so that it waits for all readers/writers of the proc
file to finish before returning, IMO.
Best wishes,
Duncan.
