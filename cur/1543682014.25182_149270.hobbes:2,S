A few notes on each of these.  I do not offer
recommendations, only facts.
CONFIG_X86_SSE:
  Used in include/asm-i386/bugs.h to panic if
  the kernel is compiled for SSE2 but the
  processor does not support it.
CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA_RADIO:
  Used in drivers/net/wireless/ray_cs.c.
CONFIG_INTEL_RNG:
  Not used anywhere in code.
