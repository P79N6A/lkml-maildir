From reading the sources I got the impression that the use count of
the ip_conntrack struct isn't decremented properly. This causes
destroy_conntrack() not to free ip_conntrack's - which results allocation
until the maximum (ip_conntrack_max), and failing to allocate new ones.
p.s. Get a popcorn when you're reading netfilter's sources - bumping into
a label like 'i_see_dead_people' is quite amusing...
