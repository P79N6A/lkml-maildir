I did some testing today and found that the error occurs after
applying some of the patches. However I did not figure out the exact
patch in which the error "starts" since it sometimes occurs immediatly
when moving some data over the net and sometimes it takes 30 min till
I get the transmit timeout. I will be away till sunday and do some
more testing then.
