Hi,
I've got a lot of trouble from corrupted filesystems under 2.2.12.
One system uses 3x Adaptec Scsi + raid0 on dual SMP and the other machine
which gives me trouble is a Buslogic scsi. Both have asus mainboards with
a p2/450 or higher.
The non SMP machine (which also is nfs server, userland nfsd) gives me the
'famous' attempt to access beyond end of device. Here are 3 lines from the
1000 or so i got:
Oct 18 08:03:33 mail kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device  
Oct 18 08:03:33 mail kernel: 08:11: rw=0, want=1177235274, limit=17775891  
Oct 18 08:03:33 mail kernel: dev 08:11 blksize=1024 blocknr=1177235273
sector=-1940496750 size=1024 count=1  
The want= and blocknr= and sector= (and others) are all the same on all
messages. It also gives a lot of trouble during a fsck. Lot's op dup
blocks.
The other machine which is SMP and uses raid0 only gives me bad entry in
directory. Since this is a 100g news spool you can imagine it's no fun to
fsck that baby :)
All of these errors are probably reproducable. It just take a couple of
days/hours before they are occuring. 
If anyone needs more info, just tell me!
Kind Regards,
Tommy
