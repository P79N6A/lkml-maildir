second_overflow() changes the tick length, but the new tick length is now 
applied to varying number of ticks with your patch, which is bad for 
correct timekeeping.

You have to keep in mind that ntp time is basically advanced in 1 second 
steps (or HZ ticks or freq cycles to be precise) and you have to keep that 
property. You can slice that second however you like, but it still has to 
add up to 1 second. Right now we slice it into HZ steps, but this can be 
rather easily changed now.
bye, Roman
