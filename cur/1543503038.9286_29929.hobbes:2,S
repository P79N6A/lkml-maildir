To be honest, my understanding is that ALL of the distributors who use
packaging systems provide packages with patched versions of the
sources, and the fact that they are patched doesn't stop them being
Linux. Normally, the patches in the kernel packages either work their
way back into the kernel source tree soon after (which accounts for
well over 90% of such patches), or are required due to some aspect of
the setup of that distribution that differs from the default.
One example of the latter that I can think of relates to the use and
configuration of modprobe in the 2.0 kernel series under RedHat 5.x
where it would prefer to use modules in /lib/modules/preferred/* to
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/* if the former existed. The patch for that
was the equivalent or replacing the following...
 Q> cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`
...with the following...
 Q> cd /lib/modules
 Q> if [ -d preferred ]; then
 Q>     cd preferred
 Q> else
 Q>     cd `uname -r`
 Q> fi
...and the resultant effect on bug detection doesn't even need a
single finger to count it on...

I have used both RedHat and Debian regularly, and have also used
Slackware briefly, and in my experience, the distribution one installs
from makes NO difference whatsoever once it has been installed: The
resulting system is LINUX.

The bulk of the patches used by RedHat in the kernels are ones that
have been developed to fix some bug in the raw kernels, although not
necessarily by Alan. Those patches are almost inevitably included in
the following kernel release.
The patches that don't fall into that category are inevitably minor
configuration changes that are specific to the RedHat distribution,
being similar to that quoted above. These are few in number, and are
inevitably of the variety that are incapable of causing other bugs.

My inderstanding of the differences between 2.2.5-15 and 2.2.5-22 is
that the latter consists of the former patched with SOME of the
patches in the 2.2.5-ac series, plus SOME of the patches generated by
Andrea Archangel, some generated by Peter Anvin, etc., and that ALL of
the differences made their way into the kernel tree by 2.2.7, although
not all were in there for 2.2.6.
It would therefore be WRONG to refer to it as being 2.2.5-ac2 (it
isn't), or in fact to refer to it as anything other than 2.2.5-22.

Is he?
Best wishes from Riley.
