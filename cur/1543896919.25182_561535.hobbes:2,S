No, it is *categorically* *impossible* for the scheduler to get that  
decision right.  For example, if my job is as a programmer and I'm  
waiting for a build during lunchbreak then I may not care that the  
process in the background makes my DVD-player drop a few frames, as  
long as it gets done 10% quicker.  That kind of decision is *POLICY*,  
and it does not belong in the kernel.  If you want the kernel to  
treat one job or the other as more important then you must *TELL* it  
that, end of story.

It can't do that.  The with-CFS kernel just sees 2 CPU-heavy  
processes and guesses that it should give them equal CPU.  "stock"  
kernels have an algorithm designed to promote some tasks for  
"interactivity", but in practice it also tended to cause other  
processes to be denied CPU for arbitrarily long periods of time,  
hence why CFS is an improvement.  Under the old scheduler even if you  
had 2 DVD player processes each chewing 45% CPU, you could still have  
dropped frames because for a second or two one would be more  
"interactive" than the other, and vice versa.  Under CFS/SD, they are  
both classified equally and so get equal CPU allocation *AND* latency.

I don't see any reason someone couldn't write a simple little GUI  
program to enumerate the user-owned X processes (somewhat like the  
Windows Task-Manager but less complicated) and allow them to change  
priorities.  Alternatively your desktop environment could set up a  
little privileged wrapper which appropriately executes the HD video  
player.  One of the primary rules of kernel development is that you  
cannot put policy in the kernel, and a statement of the form  
"PROCESS1 is more important than PROCESS2" is pure policy and must be  
done from userspace.  We even give appropriate enforcement mechanisms  
to userspace to take such action (nice levels).
