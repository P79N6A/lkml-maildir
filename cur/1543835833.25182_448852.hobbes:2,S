I am not a SCSI guru but answer anyway. The gurus are over at
linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org.
Doug Gilbert has an overview about SCSI power management:
http://sg.torque.net/sg/power.html
Long ago Brian King submitted code to the SCSI error handler of Linux
2.6 that issues the START STOP UNIT command. This code is inactive per
default to avoid clashes with USB disks.

A recently merged patch allows to activate this code via a sysfs
attribute.

I don't know if there is similar code for Linux 2.4.
