the I/O write throughput takes a -24% hit.  The kernel compile runs 21%
faster.
Note that -24% is the opposite of +31%.
Problem is that we can't easily compare I/O bandwidth with cpu
utilization. But slowing down the writer of 31% of its previous
bandwidth, doesn't look an obvious improvement despite the kernel
compiles 21% faster. Depends if you were waiting on the write, or on the
kernel compile.

it's still not completely obvious if your improvement didn't came partly
from the SIGSTOP tar. Probably not because we found later that contest
uses nr_cpus * 4 and not some bigger number that I expected.
