eh.. Download the source again? then make a diff (described in the
linux-kernel FAQ, 
http://www.tux.org/lkml
).

I can't really comment on the bugs, but have you tested 2.4.0-testX and
seen if that has a problem with this too? If it is maybe you want to fix
that.

I think the interface has a few parameters too many in 2.2, if someone
feels like doing it ...  Look at the nls interface in 2.4.0-test5. Oh,
wait, that interface is more different than so. Well, look at it anyway.

No, not yet. If you want to test it I have a nls patch for 2.2.17-pre13
(and various other versions) here:
    
http://www.hojdpunkten.ac.se/054/samba/index.html
(should re-diff vs pre14 ... eh pre15, and 2.4.0, other versions
 available on request).
