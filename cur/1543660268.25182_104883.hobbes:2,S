Thank you very much all of you for the answers.So, this should be an 
harmless message, I've tried to attach something to the parallel port , 
or disable it in the bios, but doesn't work, the only way to remove this 
problem is to load the parport_pc module, this message with the module 
loaded doesn't appear. I've tried with other bioses , and the problem 
appears on all of them. If I compile in the kernel UP-IO-ACPI the 
problem disappears, but I have a lot of other problems, because my 
system is quite young and the support for IO-APIC is not added yet for 
me.If I use only UP-APIC this problem appears, and if don't use apic 
this disappears.
I'll try to remove some HW and retry. Someone had this problem without 
APIC enabled?
Thank you
Bye
Marcello
