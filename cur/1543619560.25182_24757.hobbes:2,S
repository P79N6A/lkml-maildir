Hmm ... the race you mention in sys_stat is the problem I saw.  I also
can't say for sure whether any code, or future code, would touch
i_size.  It is just not safe.
Note also that reverting to the remote_llseek method won't break
anything; it is the previous behavior.  Certainly I would much rather
just use the inode semaphore, but I'd prefer to not introduce any
races.  Ideally we need a solution that eliminates the BKL _and_ is not
racy.
I'd be happy to keep Coda using the new generic_file_llseek if Al Viro
agrees with you.  Al?
