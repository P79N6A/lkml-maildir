That's OK.  Keep in mind that you have a *lot* of these guys and your
cat(1) makes a lot of read(2) calls.  So what you see is
<starting to read>
<see inode #n that is about to be evicted>
<read some more>
<inode #n gets evicted, quite possibly - due to memory pressure from cat(1)
or sort(1)>
<read more>
<somebody wants the same inode again>
<read more>
<see the inode #n we'd just had read from disk again>
So few duplicates are all right.
