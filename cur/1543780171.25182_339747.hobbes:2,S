I tried to pass --real-mode flag to kexec but my virtual machine doesn't like
it. When I launch kexec -e, it tells me: "A strange behaviour occourred which
crashed virtual machine". I'll dig source code ASAP to figure out this matter.
Meanwhile I'm going to follow your advice to inspect video.S in order to track
down something useful.
