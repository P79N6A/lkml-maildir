I've seen this too on 2.0.35 running Netscape 4.05.  A strace on the process
produces output exactly like the above.  My machine is a 486-66 with 32MB RAM,
libc 5.4.46.  Netscape becomes unresponsive and difficult to kill without a
SIGKILL.  It only happens occasionally, though, and doesn't seem to affect
anything else.
