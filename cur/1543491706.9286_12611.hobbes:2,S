Hi,
I noticed that if I compile the kernel with -g I cannot use the "list"
command on functions like start_kernel(), sched_init() and many others. By
looking at what is common amongst them I noticed that they are either
__init or __initfunc.
So, the question is - why is this and can it be avoided somehow (via ld
scripts or ld(1) switches?). The gcc is 2.7.2.3, ld is 2.9.1.
Regards,
Tigran.
