I think you do.
That pair might have to disable interrupts (if there are any issues about
concurrent accesses through a shared error bus). In that case, the cooke 
might be the old "flags" value.

But they may be part of that the architecture wants to do (imagine a 
spinlock protecting a sub-segment of a bus - you need to disable 
interrupts to avoid deadlocks).
