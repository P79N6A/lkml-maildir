Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Portable NBD server

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Apologies for the cross-post, but this is relevant to all three lists.
Please don't cross-post followups (unless they're relevant to several
lists); obey the Reply-To or reply to me directly.
The NBD server in nbd-2.7.1 from nbd.sourceforge.net doesn't compile on
non-Linux hosts, even though the server doesn't do anything inherently
nonportable.  So I wrote a new one that should work fine on any POSIX
host with 'long long'.
I've successfully used it to recover log data on a dirty ext3 filesystem
that ended up in an OpenBSD box.
I hope this proves useful to someone.
