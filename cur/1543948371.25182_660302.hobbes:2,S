I suspect nv_adma_register_mode failing may be the key. I don't know why 
this happens. It could be the timeout needs to be longer but I've tried 
increasing it significantly without apparent effect. (Essentially it's 
waiting for the status to go to the IDLE state, and then clears the GO 
bit and waits for LEGACY to be set. In this case both waits timed out.)
