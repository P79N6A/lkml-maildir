You are right.  On the machine with Gnome, I ran "make gconfig" again,
changed one of the HID options from "y" to "m", and then the HIDBP options
became available.
Sorry, I didn't guess that changing a setting between "y" and "m" could
affect the visibility of other options this way.  In this case it seems
reasonable, but I still didn't imagine this kind of thing.  Sorry.
