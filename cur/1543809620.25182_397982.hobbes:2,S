Is there something in the driver model which would prevent something
like this?
static void scsi_release_process(void *p)
{
	struct my_work *work = p;
	struct device *dev = work->dev;
	/* destroy dev */
	kfree(work);
}
static void scsi_release(struct device *dev)
{
	struct my_work *work;
	work = kmalloc(sizeof(struct my_work), GFP_ATOMIC);
	if (work) {
		INIT_WORK(&work->work, scsi_release_process, work);
		work->dev = dev;
		schedule_work(&work->work);
	} else {
		printk(KERN_ERR ...);
	}
}
where scsi_release() is the function called by the device model on the
last put of a scsi device.
I guess is more or less what you're trying to do invasively via the
driver model.
