Another possible solution would be to delay initialisation of the hardware 
until the network interface is brought up. This is a more robust approach 
because then if something bad happens and the firmware needs to be reloaded, 
you can just cycle the interface (ifdown/ifup) and the firmware will be 
reuploaded.
An example of hardware doing this is the prism54 driver (also in tree) which 
delays loading the firmware until it absolutely has to. This driver survives 
being built-in quite happily.
