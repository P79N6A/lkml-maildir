From the BogoMips mini howto:
System                        BogoMips         Comparison 
Intel Pentium               clock * 0.40          2.2 
AMD K5/K6/K6-2              clock * 2.00         11.1
Pentium MMX                 clock * 2.00         11.1 
So you are all OK:
AMD K5 75Mhz ->        2 x 75 =  150
Intel Pentium 120 ->    0.4 x 120 =  48
Intel Petium 200 MMX ->   2 x 200 = 400
There is a reason why they are called BOGUS ;-)
