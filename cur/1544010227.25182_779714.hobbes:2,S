The assumption is that THREAD_SIZE is a power of 2, as is PAGE_SIZE.
I think Yuri should be increasing THREAD_SIZE for the larger page
sizes he's implementing, because we have on-stack arrays whose size
depends on the page size.  I suspect that having THREAD_SIZE less than
1/8 of PAGE_SIZE risks stack overflows, and the better fix is for Yuri
to make sure THREAD_SIZE is at least 1/8 of PAGE_SIZE.  (In fact, more
may be needed - someone should work out what fraction is actually
needed.)
