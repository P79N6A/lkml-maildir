execve seems to have changed it's behavior somewhere between 2.3.50
and 2.3.99-pre3, this is a strace from postfix running under 2.3.50:
---
[pid  1843] close(5)                    = 0
[pid  1843] execve("/usr/bin/exec", ["exec", "/usr/bin/procmail"], [/* 9 vars */]) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid  1843] execve("/bin/exec", ["exec", "/usr/bin/procmail"], [/* 9 vars */]) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid  1843] execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "exec /usr/bin/procmail"], [/* 9 vars */]) = 0
[pid  1843] brk(0)                      = 0x80623ec
---
and the same under 2.3.99-pre3:
---
[pid   423] close(5)                    = 0
[pid   423] execve("/usr/bin/exec", ["exec", "/usr/bin/procmail"], [/* 9 vars */]) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
[pid   423] execve("/bin/exec", ["exec", "/usr/bin/procmail"], [/* 9 vars */]) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
[pid   423] time([954165947])           = 954165947
---
This causes postfix to fail the delivery with:
Mar 27 17:05:48 mikat local[424]: fatal: execvp exec: Permission denied
Mar 27 17:05:49 mikat postfix/local[398]: 16BF55777: to=<mika@mikat.pp.sci.fi>, relay=local, delay=1, status=bounced (Command died with status 1: "exec /usr/bin/procmail")
Is this a bug in the kernel or postfix?
