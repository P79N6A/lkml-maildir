gcc-2.8.1 has been rock-solid reliable for me, but in any event, I
don't think the gcc version is the problem here.

Possibly.  I was able to duplicate the broken behavior on a P150MMX
with gcc-2.7.2.3 and binutils-2.9.1.0.25: this is a libc5 (glibc1)
system.  The Cyrix system mentioned above is a glibc2 system, so this
problem doesn't seem to depend on libc5 vs. libc6 differences (and it
shouldn't).
The binutils release I'm using on all my systems is supposedly the
latest stable release.  If a development release is required, I'd be
interested in knowing what the preferred kernel building setup is
these days.  Maybe someone could update linux/Documentation/Changes
accordingly?
Thanks in advance.
