Hi David-
I noticed that the disk array component of this stuff actually does not 
require the kernel modules, which is good news. So, you should be able to 
install the 'cmafdtn', 'cmastor', 'cpqhealth' and 'ucd-snmp' RPMs from 
compaq and monitor your drives via SNMP without using their darn kernel 
modules. I assume that it's communicating with the array via the cciss 
driver in some way.
Hope this helps.
