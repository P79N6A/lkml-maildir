Being restrictive is ok, but keeping patches in queues for longer than needed 
creates more headaches than it solves, in my experience.

Well, we're slowly working on that... very slowly... I've thought multiple 
times to at least run Lindent on arch/um but I've not spoken up because of 
all the conflicts we (me and Jeff) would get with patches in our queues.
However, there are occasions in which we get conflicts anyway for other 
reorganization, and in that case Lindent would be useful. Ok Jeff? I'm 
speaking for instance about moving to os-Linux and such.
