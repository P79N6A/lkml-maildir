Any existing interface should be supported, but Reiser4 seems to want to
replace all existing interfaces except a direct open() and a proposed
new system call which opens lots of small files at once, efficiently.
The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, though.

The proposal I like right now is /meta, as a separate FS, which provides
access to what would be the '...' interface.  Check the archives.

You put it in /meta, which is available to all filesystems.

Namesys still hasn't commented directly on the /meta proposal, have
they?  That would avoid the flamewar altogether.
