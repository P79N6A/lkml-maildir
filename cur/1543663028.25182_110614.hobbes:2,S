Here's the explanation from Anton about why using init_mm is
a problem on ppc64.

Hi Suparna,
On ppc64 we have many 2^41B (2 TB) regions:
USER
KERNEL
VMALLOC
IO
Why 2TB? Well our three level linux pagetables can map 2TB. The kernel has
no pagetables, so we only need three sets of pagetables. As usual each
user task has its own set of pagetables. So that leaves vmalloc and IO.
For IO we create our own pgd, ioremap_pgd and for vmalloc we use init_mm.
Why not? Its not being used anywhere else... except for kexec.
So init_mm covers the region of:
0xD000000000000000 to 0xD000000000000000+2^41
And what kexec wants is a page under 4GB :)
Thats why we created another mm.
Could you please forward it on to the list?
Thanks!
Anton
