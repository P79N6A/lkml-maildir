Not DataFlash.  But many other modern flash chips do, like
most of the ones handled by the m25p80 driver.   As noted
there in the comment about how it should switch over to use
the fast read command ...

Considering the m25p80 driver started on a uClinux platform
that ISTR couldn't achieve the 33+ MHz clock rates for SPI,
it doesn't seem at all odd to me!
And in fact, lots of Linux systems for some reason don't
seem to be able to clock SPI that fast, even if a given
board were laid out to handle 50+ MHz signaling there.
