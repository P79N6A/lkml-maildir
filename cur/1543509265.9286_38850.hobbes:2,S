This was after recersing ac2 patch, putting in ac3, make mrproper, make
oldconfig, make dep and make bzlilo.
Everything is built into the kernel except for bsd compression which
gives an erronuous error when you try to select it to be built into
the kernel. It says that due to something else being a module it has
to be... which is wrong as nothing else is a module.
In arch/i386/Makefile there is this:
ifdef CONFIG_MK7
CFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) -DCPU=686 -march=pentiumpro -mpentiumpro -malign-functions=4 -fschedule-insns2 -mwide-multiply -fexpensive-optimizations
CFLAGS += $(shell if $(CC) -march=i686 -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "-march=i686"; fi)
AFLAGS := $(AFLAGS) -DCPU=686
endif
-march=pentiumpro -mpentiumpro is overkill. -march option includes -mcpu
(which -m alone is an alias of) so this can be written as -march=pentiumpro
and achieve the same effect.
Better still, to keep it inline with the other lines, change it to
-march=i686.
Also,
CFLAGS_NSR  := -fno-strength-reduce
Isn't this like for real old compilers where this is buggy? I know that in
gcc 2.7.2.3+? this is automatically turned off. I've had it commented out
in my kernel compiles for months now and never had the kernel screw up
on me wholly. I've always used egcs 1.0.3+.
Wouldn't be an idea to remove it?
