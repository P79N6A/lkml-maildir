I agree the code obviously looks ok, I will verify against 2.6.9-rc3 
anyways and send an updated patch that gets a non-tweaked gcc 3.3.3 
build to boot.  Additional fixes are needed for regparm compliance 
between prototypes and functions; I've done these for i386, but may have 
missed some in other architectures.  I'd also like to get rid of the 
apparently harmless lvalue warnings I get from gcc 3.3.3.
I checked the gcc docs but couldn't find any versions where noinline was 
unsupported, although I should have assumed otherwise.
