Thanks to Al Viro, Jeff Garzik, Arjan van de Ven, Davem, Thomas Hiller,
Alan Cox, and any other whom I might have missed towards getting this
list more up-to-date.
I've also arranged to post the latest version of this list at:
	
http://linux24.sourceforge.net
At the moment I'm only using the sourceforge project web page; this is
because my home DSL line is only 416k, and I didn't want it to get
Slashdotted.  
As a preemptive strike, everyone and his brother has approached me
suggesting that I use their favorite bug tracking system.  The answer
which I'm giving folks is that for now, trying to get the information
into a sane state is far more important than the mechanism of which bug
tracking system to use.  At the moment, the hardest parts of the problem
are:
	* Figuring out when Linus has applied a patch that fixes a
		particular item on the bug list.
	* Determining when someone complains whether it's a real bug or
		not, and if so, how important is it.
	* Ditto for when someone posts a patch.
	* Figuring out what Alan meant by descriptive items such 
		as "Check all devices use resources properly"  
		(If anyone has a copy of Vulcan Mind Melds for Dummies,
		let me know.  :-)
Anyway, here's the latest list.   Enjoy.....

   Important note! I just recently inherited this list from Alan, so it
   may not be fully accurate yet. Please send updates to tytso@mit.edu.

Should Be Fixed (Confirmation Wanted)
     * IDE fails on some VIA boards (eg the i-opener)
     * Floppy driver broken by VFS changes. Other drivers may be too
       (Stuff gets called after _close now - unload race possibly too)
     * Fbcon races
     * Fix all remaining PCI code to use pci_enable_device (mostly done)
       
Capable Of Corrupting Your FS
     * Use PCI DMA by default in IDE is unsafe (must not do so on via VPx
       x<3)
     * Data corruption on IDE disks (Generic PCI DMA and SiS support
       (Steven Walter)
       
Security
     * Fix module remove race bug (still to be done: TTY, ldisc, I2C,
       video_device, network devices(?) - Al Viro)
     * access_process_mm oops/lockup if task->mm changes (Manfred) [user
       can cause deliberately]
       
Boot Time Failures
     * AHA29xx driver appears to stomp other cards (may be BIOS)
     * AHA27xx is broken (maybe 28xx too)
     * Use PCI DMA 'lost interrupt' problem with some hw [which ?] (NEC
       Versa LX with PIIX tuning)
     * HT6560/UMC8672 ide sets up stuff too early (before region stuff
       can be done)
     * Crashes on boot on some Compaqs ? (may be fixed)
     * Boot hangs on a range of Dell docking stations (Latitude)
       
Compile-time failures
     * pdc202xx.c doesn't compile under test5
       
In Progress
     * Merge the network fixes (DaveM)
     * Finish I2O merge (Intel/Alan)
     * Exploitable leak in file locking (Willy)
     * Restore O_SYNC functionality (Stephen) - core code and ext2 done
       
Obvious Projects For People (well if you have the hardware..)
     * nNCR5380 isnt smp safe
     * DMFE is not SMP safe
     * Make syncppp use new ppp code
     * Fix SPX socket code
     * Merge the 2.2 ServeRAID driver into 2.4
       
Fix Exists But Isnt Merged
     * Update SGI VisWS to new-style IRQ handling (Ingo)
     * 64bit lockf support
     * Support MP table above 1Gig (Ingo)
     * Dont panic on boot when meeting HP boxes with wacked APIC table
       numbering (AC)
     * Scheduler bugs in RT (Dimitris)
     * HFS is still broken
     * AIC7xxx doesnt work non PCI ? (Doug says OK, new version due
       anyway)
     * Fix boards with different TSC per CPU and kill TSC use on them
     * Floppy last block cache flush error
     * TB Multisound driver hasnt been updated for new isa I/O totally.
       
Compatibility Errors
     * Xterm broke in 2.3.99pre6 (FIONREAD/select loop)
       
To Do
     * mount crashes on Alpha platforms
     * Check all devices use resources properly
     * Tulip hang on rmmod/crashes sometimes
     * Devfs races (mostly done - Al Viro)
     * Fix further NFS races (Al Viro)
     * Test other file systems on write
     * Audit all char and block drivers to ensure they are safe with the
       2.3 locking - a lot of them are not especially on the
       read()/write() path.
     * Keyboard/mouse problems (may be fixed ?)
     * Fix mount failures due to copy_* user mishandling
     * Fix default mount behaviour to disallow repeat mounting
     * Check all file systems are either LFS compliant or error large
       files
     * Issue with notifiers that try to deregister themselves? (lnz)
     * Mount of new fs over existing mointpoint should return an error
       unless forced (Andrew McNabb, Alan Cox)
     * Kernel build has race conditions when building modversions.h
       (Mikael Pettersson)
       
To Do But Non Showstopper
     * Finish 64bit vfs merges (lockf64 and friends missing)
     * Go through as 2.4pre kicks in and figure what we should mark
       obsolete for the final 2.4
     * Union mount (Al Viro)
     * Per Process rtsigio limit
     * iget abuse in knfsd
     * Some people report 2.3.x serial problems
     * USB hangs on APM suspend on some machines
     * ISAPnP IRQ handling failing on SB1000 + resource handling bug
     * DVD-RAM is apparently not working for write currently (Rogier
       Wolff)
     * Parallel ports should set SA_SHIRQ if PCI (eg in Plip)
     * Devfs compiled in but not mounted causes crap for ->mnt_devname of
       root (Al Viro)
     * PCMCIA/Cardbus hangs, IRQ problems. (Basically unusable - Hinds
       pcmcia code is reliable)
          + PCMCIA crashes on unloading pci_socket
          + yenta (PCMCIA) and pci_socket modules have mutual dependency
            (cardbus_register, yenta_operations) (test5, worked in test3)
       
To Check
     * Check O_APPEND atomicity bug fixing is complete
     * Protection on i_size (sct) [Al Viro mostly done]
     * Mikulas claims we need to fix the getblk/mark_buffer_uptodate
       thing for 2.3.x as well
     * Network block device seems broken by block device changes
     * VFS?VM - mmap/write deadlock (demo code seems to show lock is
       there)
     * rw sempahores on page faults (mmap_sem)
     * kiobuf seperate lock functions/bounce/page_address fixes
     * Fix routing by fwmark
     * rw semaphores on inodes to fix read/truncate races ? [Probably
       fixed]
     * Not all device drivers are safe now the write inode lock isnt
       taken on write
     * Multiwrite IDE breaks on a disk error [minor issue at best]
     * ACPI/APM suspend issue - IDE related stuff ?
     * NFS bugs are fixed
     * Chase reports of SMB not working
     * IRDA calls get random bytes before random is set up
     * Some AWE cards are not being found by ISAPnP ??
     * SHM segments not always being detached and destroyed right ?
     * RAM disk contents vanishing on cramfs (block change) and bforget
       cases
     * ACPI hangs on boot for some systems (Are there any cases left ?)
       
Drivers In 2.2 not 2.4
Probably Post 2.4
     * per super block write_super needs an async flag
     * addres_space needs a VM pressure/flush callback (Ingo)
     * per file_op rw_kiovec

     * Set SMP affinity mask to actual cpu online mask (needed for some
       boards) (Ingo)

     * pci_set_master forces a 64 latency on low latency setting
       devices.Some boards require all cards have latency <= 32
     * msync fails on NFS (probably fixed anyway)
     * Find out what has ruined disk I/O throughput. (mostly)
     * PIII FXSAVE/FXRESTORE support
     * The netdev name changing stuff broke GRE
     * put_user is broken for i386 machines (security) - sem stuff may be
       wrong too
     * BusLogic crashes when you cat /proc/scsi/BusLogic/0 (Robert de
       Vries)
