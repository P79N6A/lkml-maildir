no.. it will not work. looks like we have to unlock and lock dcache_lock and
use mntput as I did earlier. But I think, it will be really nice if Jermey
can revisit is_tree_busy() code.
There can be other problems like the checking d_count for dentries under
dcache_lock(). As users can do dget() or dput() manipulating d_count without
dcache_lock().
