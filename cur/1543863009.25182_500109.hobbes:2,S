To which the response is something like
"This is impossible/illegal/unsupported so it can't be done." 
Fortunately, civilized countries have laws against being
fired for being unable to do the impossible.
Well, nothing is really impossible.  Tell the boss about
the man-hours needed to implement a kernel file API
from scratch, and then forking the kernel
in order to maintain this community-rejected abomination
forever.

Another way is to cheat.  The boss asks the impossible, so
make a workaround in the form of a userspace program that
does the file writing while communicationg with the driver.
The driver installer software can then be made to install
this userspace program as well. Looks like a hack - but it
is the recommended way of doing these things. Often enough you
have a startup script for the thing anyway, a good place to
launch userspace helper apps.  Either that, or userspace
will be involved somehow in using the device - launch the
helper at that time.
Try not to get in a situation where the boss explicitly asks
for files written from the kernel.  If you're making a driver and
the boss ask for a file - just write that userspace helper
because that is the way it is done on linux.  No conflict there.
