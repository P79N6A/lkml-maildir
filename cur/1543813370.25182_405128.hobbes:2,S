If your driver allocated these pages and never added them to the LRU then
the VM won't touch them.
If your driver owns the pages and has a ref on them then they won't get
freed at task exit-time.
If the app owns the pages and you're using get_user_pages() then your
driver owns the last ref on the pages.

We'd need to see a halfway decent description of the problem first ;)
