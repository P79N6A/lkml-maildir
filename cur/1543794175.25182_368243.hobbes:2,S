The above profile data are gathered on comparing two big files:
# du /temp/kernel/bigfile*
626M    /temp/kernel/bigfile
626M    /temp/kernel/bigfile2
I run another real life test:
# grep -r 'asdfghjkl;' /backup/test/linux-2.6.14-rc4-git4-orig/
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile3:        16    43.2% radix_tree_tag_clear
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile3:         8    24.2% radix_tree_tag_set
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile3:        -9    -5.8% radix_tree_lookup_node
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile4:         7     4.5% radix_tree_lookup_node
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile4:        -8   -11.8% radix_tree_tag_clear
As expected, there's no noticable difference for small files.

Wu
