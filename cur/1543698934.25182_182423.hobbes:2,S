I don't have spdiff hardware (nor do I have register chart...), so I
can not be certain, but try changing:
#define	   SPDF_0	0x01
#define	   SPDF_1	0x02
to 
#define	   SPDF_0	0x02
#define	   SPDF_1	0x01
And change from function set_spdif_monitor line:
  maskw(s->iobase + CODEC_CMI_FUNCTRL1, ~SPDO2DAC, channel == 2 ? SPDO2DAC : 0);
to:
  maskw(s->iobase + CODEC_CMI_FUNCTRL1, ~SPDO2DAC, channel == 1 ? SPDO2DAC : 0);
If this does not help. try looking for similar value pairs -- it seems
that channel number assumptions are present in quite many places...
