OK. But the hole from 3.75 - 4GB you're referring to doesn't seem to
fall under that definition. 
1) It still has a valid pfn, though the backing memory itself isn't there.
2) It's covered by node_start_pfn ... node_start_pfn + node_spanned_pages,
	which is what your patch tests for. Maybe not if you have = 4GB
	per node? Will be if you have more than that.
I agree that pfn_valid absolutely has to be correct. The current definition
was, I thought, correct unless we have holes *between* nodes. I was under
the impression that no box we had uses that setup, but I guess we might
do - were you seeing this on x440 or NUMA-Q?
NUMA-Q looks like this:
BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 00000000e0000000 (usable)
BIOS-e820: 00000000fec00000 - 00000000fec09000 (reserved)
BIOS-e820: 00000000ffe80000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
BIOS-e820: 0000000100000000 - 0000000400000000 (usable)
which should create mem_map from 0 - 4GB contigious for node 0, AFAICS
(I believe struct pages are created for reserved areas still). Maybe
the srat stuff for x440 does something else.
Your patch is correct, I just don't see that it'll fix the X problem.

Cool, thanks. I'll try runtesting it.
