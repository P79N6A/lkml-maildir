Well, the primary fairness mechanism in the scheduler is the time slice 
allocation and the capping code doesn't fiddle with those so there 
should be a reasonable degree of fairness (taking into account "nice") 
between capped tasks.  To improve that would require allocating several 
new priority slots for use by tasks exceeding their caps and fiddling 
with those.  I don't think that it's worth the bother.
When capped tasks aren't exceeding their cap they are treated just like 
any other task and will get the same amount of fairness.
