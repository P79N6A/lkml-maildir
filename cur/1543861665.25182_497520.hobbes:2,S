to do the random e-mail, it's because it just doesn't union
"directories", but lets you assign read-write, read-only properties to
them.
If you try to modify a file on a read-only layer, it will be copied to
the top most layer (has to be read-write) and then modified.  It can be
slow though (imagine modifying a 1GB file).
