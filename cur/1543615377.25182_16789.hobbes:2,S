I hope you at least recomment /usr/sbin/dmidecode.  Least I hope that isn't
necessary for booting.  ;->

It's not just a simple od -c type of output that a post-processor could
decode turn back into binary and decode.  The routine would still have to
locate the DMI table, and decode at least the appropriate length of the
table, present that to the output, and then dump the output in hex format
or something.  Why risk getting that wrong and screwing up kernel internals
when it can already be done in userspace?
