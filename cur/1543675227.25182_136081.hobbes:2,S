This means they have no type at all, either because of a parse error, or 
because the lazy evaluation hasn't evaluated it yet (ie it was a tad _too_ 
lazy).

Right.
The first thing to do is to see where it happens, in gdb do
	up 		(to get to compatible_assignment_types)
	p expr->pos	(to get where in the soruce file it is)
it's triggered in cramfs_uncompress_block():
	zlib_inflateReset(&stream);
on "stream", and the problem _seems_ to be that the target type for the
function call comparison is non-existent.
And that, in turn, seems to be because of the old K&R style function 
prototype due to
#ifndef OF /* function prototypes */
#  ifdef STDC   
#    define OF(args)  args
#  else
#    define OF(args)  ()
#  endif
#endif
and check not defining STDC.
It appears to be fixed by just adding -DSTDC to the check command line, to 
make zlib use ANSI prototypes.
In short: sparse doesn't handle K&R function declarations very well,
although clearly it shouldn't have segfaulted (it should have warned about
it). I don't know why it didn't warn.

Yeah, gdb is crap when it comes to anonymous structures, but I can't live 
without them these days, so..

It probably shouldn't be CC'd to linux-kernel, but there isn't any other 
place either.
