"0x%x" would reduce confusion.

Yeah.  Although you'd be forgiven for retaining the private implementation.
"[patch] consolidate all the within() implementations" is a separate work
and it'd be wrong to say this-is-a-prerequisite.

hm, sad.  u64 is long on some 64-bit architectures and long long on others.

OK.  It just looks rather slow...

np.
The increase in kenrel size is pretty shocking.  From a sample of 1
(mm/swap.o) it really does increase text and data by about a factor of
three.  I assume that this means that distributors will be unable to enable
this feature, which makes it a kernel-developers-only thing.  Which is OK,
I guess.  But a shame.
