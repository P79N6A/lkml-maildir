__deprecated_for_modules already does everything required for compile 
time warnings.
No need to make the kernel image even bigger for unused stuff.
Looking over the patches I sent, this might affect perhaps 200 unused 
exports today.
So the work would expand to:
- writing 200 feature-removal-schedule.txt entries
- marking 200 functions and variables as __deprecated_for_modules
And in a few months:
- removing 200 feature-removal-schedule.txt entries
- removing 200 __deprecated_for_modules markers
- removing the 200 unused exports
But what do we gain by doing this extra work?
As I said in my other email, there is no good reason to not break 
external modules.
And this is reaching the point where I'm spending too much of the part 
of my spare time I'm devoting to Linux kernel development in following 
useless processes instead of doing something having a result making it 
worth spending my time for.
