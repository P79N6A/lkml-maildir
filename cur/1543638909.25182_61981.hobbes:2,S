I am happy, that someone (smarter than me) seems to be interested in
fixing this bug :-)

I undarstand this. Even with my (now I know - broken) patch kernel warns
that device is in use, and that destruction will be delayed.
But you are right, warning displayed every 3 seconds, when nothing else
works is much easier to notice :-)
