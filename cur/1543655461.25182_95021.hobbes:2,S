yes, but i'd like to clarify one more thing - worst-case O(1)  
interactivity indeed is indeed very jerky (eg. the fast window moving
thing you noticed), but the normal behavior is much better than the old
scheduler's. Just try compiling the kernel with make -j4 under stock 2.4
and _everything_ in X will be jerky. With the O(1) scheduler things are
just as smooth as on an idle system - as long as your application does not
get rated CPU-intensive. [which happens too fast in the case you
described.] So we do have something in 2.5 that is visibly better in a
number of cases, and i want to preserve that - while fixing the
corner-cases discussed here. I'm working on it.
