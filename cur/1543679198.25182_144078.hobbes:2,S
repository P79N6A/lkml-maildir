Apart from the special case of converting from one major version of a
filesystem to another major version of the same filesystem, I think
the performance of an on-the-fly filesystem conversion utility is
going to be so much worse than just creating a new partition and
copying the data across, that the only reason to do it would be if you
could do it on a read-write filesystem without unmounting it.
What I'd like to see is union mounts which allowed you to mount a new
filesystem of a different type over the original one, and have all new
writes go to the new fileystem.  I.E. as files were modified, they
would be re-written to the new FS.  That would be one way of avoiding
the performance hit on a busy server.
John.
