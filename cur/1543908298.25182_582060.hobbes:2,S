isn't it better to change
    int (*dev_uevent)(struct device *dev,
                                 char **envp, int num_envp,
                                 char *buffer, int buffer_size);
to
    int (*dev_uevent)(struct device *dev,
                                 char **envp, int num_envp,
                                 char **buffer);
and alter the buffer pointer inside?
