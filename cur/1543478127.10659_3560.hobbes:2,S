Actually, amd is now actively supported again, under the name
"am-utils".  They do recognize the weakness of the NFS server
approach, and intend to make it support autofs on the OSes which have
it (so far they only have it for Solaris; I think they might be
interested in supporting autofs v4 when it is ready.)
Why use amd with autofs instead of the autofs daemon?  Well, it lets
you use the same maps, if you're using amd elsewhere.
Just wanted to set the record straight.
However, at the current time, if the existing autofs does what you
need, you're much better off using it than amd.
