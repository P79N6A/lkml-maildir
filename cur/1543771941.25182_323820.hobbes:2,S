That is one of the reason we like to have a driver to call explicitly
either pci_enable_msi() or pci_enable_msix() since its device may
support either or both MSI capability structure and MSI-X capability
structure. Once either MSI or MSI-X is enabled, the existing code does
not allow a driver to switch back and forth between MSI and MSI-X.
In addition, if you plan to enable MSI by default, then new function
pci_in_msi_mode is redundant because pci_enable_msi() always returns
zero if MSI was already enabled on a device. In this case, a driver must
use MSI, not MSI-X. As a result, I still prefer to have a driver to
explicitly call pci_enable_msi().
Thanks,
