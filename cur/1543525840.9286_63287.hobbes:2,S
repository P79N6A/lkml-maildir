Hi Stephen,
     Then I'm confused. If request overrun has been addressed then how 
can the oft quoted "cat /dev/zero > /foo/bar" trick cause a problem? 
Am I completely missing how this messes everything up?
     As I understood it, the problem with the /dev/zero example was 
that until the disk filled up the process would add requests faster 
than the driver could service them resulting in a request queue that 
the normal elevator algorithm would have to churn through until it 
had reached the end of the platter. If on the other hand there was 
some sort of flow control that actually prevented requests from 
overrunning the driver's ability to keep up then at some point in 
time the driver would get past the /dev/zero example and the normal 
elevator rules would result in reasonably fair allocation of the 
resource. I think that there still is an issue of fair use of the 
resource as mentioned previously by Giuliano, and perhaps we need 
some sort of priority/time slicing of IO requests as he suggests.
Perhaps it is the bdflush layer that needs to be cognizant of the 
queue length on the driver then it could ensure that when there are a 
lot of outstanding requests it doesn't queue any more. Eventually 
everything will stall waiting for the IO to complete (which it will) 
and all will be well.
	Cheers,
	Bruce.
