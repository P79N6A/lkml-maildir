It seems like the basic features we are suggesting are very close, I'll try
one last time to make a case against the 'free_some_pages' call ;-)

I'd rather see the VM trigger a flush on a specific page, but tell the FS
it's OK to do broader actions if it wants to.  In the case of write
throttling, the FS doesn't know which page has been dirty the longest,
unless it starts maintaining its own lists.  The VM has all that
information, so it kicks the throttle or periodic write off with one
buffer, and lets the FS trigger other events because we aren't under huge
memory load.
The FS doesn't know how long a page has been dirty, or how often it gets
used, or anything other than this page is pinned and waiting for X event to
take place.  If we really can't get this info to the VM in a useful
fashion, that's one thing.  But if we can clue the VM in a little and put
the decision making there, I think the end result will be more likely to
clean the right page.  That does affect performance even when we're not
under heavy memory pressure.
