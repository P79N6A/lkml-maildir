Well, if we define is as a movable object then it has to be treated as
such.  It's a protocol definition issue.  If we define it opaque, though
-- of for that matter, if we don't -- we should define what memory it
can live in, though.  Right now, the only "available" memory we have is
end of setup to 0xa0000; the command line is defined to be allocated
from this memory.
