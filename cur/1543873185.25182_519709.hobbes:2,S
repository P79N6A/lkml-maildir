Figure out if 2.6.20.2 does it too, then please try to git bisect
it down further.
I took a quick look and the two sparc64 commits between 2.6.20.1
and 2.6.20.2 are benign, a fix for E450 interrupts and a kenvctrld
fix which is for a driver for hardware your ultra60 doesn't have. :)
There is a decent amount of raid and nfs fixes in here, do you
use either?
Another commit that might be relevant is:
commit 530b09160744a12450fdacb2b78779c9830a29c8

    tty_io: fix race in master pty close/slave pty close path
Hmmm...
Please let us know if you can narrow it down further.
