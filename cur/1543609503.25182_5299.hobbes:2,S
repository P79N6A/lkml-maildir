Actually, tar _is_ doing funnies with /dev/null.  Changelog says:
1995-12-21  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>
        * buffer.c: Rename a few err variables to status.
        * extract.c: Rename a few check variables to status.
        Corrections to speed-up the sizeing pass in Amanda:
        * tar.h: Declare dev_null_output.
        * buffer.c (open_archive): Detect when archive is /dev/null.
        (flush_write): Avoid writing to /dev/null.
        * create.c (dump_file): Do not open file if archive is being
        written to /dev/null, nor read file nor restore times.
        Reported by Greg Maples and Tor Lillqvist.
One wonders why.
