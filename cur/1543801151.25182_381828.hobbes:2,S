'Cos sometimes I do incredibly dumb things like copy 2.6.14 over 
2.6.15 (well it was the a and b), so:
grant@sempro:~/linux$ do-device-id linux-2.6.15
find pci_ids defined
find symbols in source tree
find source defined symbols files
summary, line counts:
  1797 symbols-pci_ids.h-define
     0 symbols-pci_ids.h-dups			<<== no duplicates
  2194 symbols-pci_ids.h-new
  2194 symbols-pci_ids.h-orig
  1933 symbols-source-all
   433 symbols-source-define
   104 symbols-source-define-files		<<== clean these up??
  1214 symbols-source-files-include-pci.h
    29 symbols-source-files-include-pci_ids.h
The patch to scratch was really a 2.6.14 pretending to be 2.6.15, 
not wanted by anybody.
Then I was intending to start on the source files then define or 
redefine PCI IDs, removing those defines to the main pci_ids.h 
file.

Okay, thanks,
