If you have a > 8TB block device (which is common in large RAID devices
today, will be a single disk in a couple of years) then it is important
that your filesystem work with this block device.
If ext2 and ext3 didn't support > 2GB files (which was a filesystem
feature added in exactly the same way as extents are today, and nobody
bitched about it then) then they would be relegated to the same status
as minix and xiafs and all the other filesystems that are stuck in the
"we can't change" or "we aren't supported" camps.
