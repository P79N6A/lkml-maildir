With 2.4.0-test9-pre6, I don't get anything (writers on /dev/dsp block
indefinitely) using the es1371 driver, with the following specs:
es1371: version v0.26 time 21:30:39 Sep 22 2000
es1371: found chip, vendor id 0x1274 device id 0x1371 revision 0x08
es1371: found es1371 rev 8 at io 0xef00 irq 18
es1371: features: joystick 0x0
ac97_codec: AC97 audio codec, id: 0x8384:0x7609 (SigmaTel STAC9721/23)
The chip itself says "Creative ES1373" on it; it's on the motherboard.
Unfortunately I can't verify that it ever worked as I just upgraded
both kernel and motherboard.
