By "independent" do you mean driven by separate clocks? PPC64 does
use decrementer as its interrupt source and Time-base-register as 
its timesource AFAIK. Both are driven by the same clock I think.

This logic is what the arch-code should follow in picking its interrupt
source and is independent of dyn-tick. dyn-tick just works with whatever 
arch-code has chosen as its interrupt source.

Great!

Haven't tested that, but I feel can happen in practice, since we dont
control device interrupts.

Don't know. It just felt nice to avoid any unnecessary invocations.
