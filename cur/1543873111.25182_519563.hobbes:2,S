Here's my experience with RSDL 0.30 on 2.6.21-rc3-git6 under my normal
usage scenarios...
Plain desktop use (web browsing, music, etc): no noticeable change
Desktop use during kernel compile (no -j): The compile impacts desktop
use more with RSDL, but this is easily solved by nice-ing the compile
(default nice of 10 seems enough). The kind of impact I am talking about
is e.g. occasional delays in scrolling in the browser etc.
Desktop use whilst talking on Wengophone (run at nice -5): Under RSDL
some GUI use e.g. opening a new folder in nautilus causes pops (buffer
underruns) which do not occur with mainline. I suppose the changes in
RSDL might require a lower nice value for equivalent performance, but
(as a user) I am limited to -5.
Low-latency audio with JACK and Ardour2: Rock-solid performance with
either scheduler.. realtime works nicely.
Playing Quake3 (proprietary nvidia driver): Plays smoothly for both
schedulers.
So, I suppose I'd like to know what to do about the Wengophone issue,
because that really is a problem for me. I guess your re-worked -ive
nice values might help?
