+int hugetlbfs_report_meminfo(char *buf)
+{
+	long htlb = atomic_read(&hugetlb_committed_space);
+	return sprintf(buf, "HugeCommited_AS: %5lu\n", htlb);
+}
"HugeCommited_AS", typo?? Should that be double "t"?  Also can we print
in terms of kB instead of num pages to match all other entries? Something
Like: htlb<<(PAGE_SHIFT-10)?
overcomit is not checked for hugetlb mmap, is it intentional here?
