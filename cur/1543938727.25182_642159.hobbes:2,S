I guess that for this one I could have a :
if (!mod->taints & TAINT_FORCED_MODULE)

This specific one is a kernel policy matter, and I personally don't
have a strong opinion about it. I agree that you raise a good counter
argument : it can be useful to proprietary modules users to be able to
extract tracing information from those modules to argue with their
vendors that their driver/hardware is broken (a tracer is _very_ useful
in that kind of situation). However, it is also useful to proprieraty
module writers who can benefit from the merged kernel/modules traces.
Do we want to give them this ability ? It would surely help writing
better proprieraty kernel modules. Do we want this, or rather prefer to
put more pressure on them so they open their code ?
I will let others fight in the mud on this one. :)
for this one, we could add, instead :
if (!mod->taints & (TAINT_FORCED_MODULE | TAINT_PROPRIETARY_MODULE))
