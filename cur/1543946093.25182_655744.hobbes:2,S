I didn't know this. What do they do instead?
I understand that WC was added originally because AGP was really slow
at IO towards the CPU. You mean on PCI-E it is fast enough now
that standard cached WB works well enough?

At least the X server still uses it. In fact there are already some
performance regression regarding this from differing kernel behavioun
in the sysfs interfaces vs /dev/mem.
What would you recommend should the X server use instead? Always
map standard WB?  How about on older AGP systems?
