afaik, there's no hardware raid support in the chip - it's just 
another dual-channel controller, with some raid0 (perhaps raid1)
software in bios.  I think Andre has said that he has hopes of 
getting docs on HPT's on-disk raid layout - but this is a software
thing, and all it would give us is interoperability with that other OS.
