If you can't publish results from that certain benchmark due its stupid
restrictions, could you also try running an alternative benchmark that
you can show results from ?
These nebulous claims of 'measurable gains' could mean anything.
I'm assuming you see a substantial increase in throughput, but
how much is it worth in exchange for complicating the code?
