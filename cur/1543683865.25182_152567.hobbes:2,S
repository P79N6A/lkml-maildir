Actually this is only a tiny part of this work and adequate improvement in 
many different scheduler tweaks have already addressed this. This is now more 
about maintaining good all round interactivity and fairness. Improving audio 
beyond ordinary scheduling tweaks is another issue which may lead to some 
form of soft user RR task. su tasks already can be reniced or made RR to 
help.

Your concerns are well founded. However neither Ingo nor I (and all the other 
contributors) are trying to make an audio app scheduler. At some stage a 
modification will be made to the mainline kernel which will have adequate 
audio performance in many (but not all) settings, and more importantly be 
fair and interactive.
