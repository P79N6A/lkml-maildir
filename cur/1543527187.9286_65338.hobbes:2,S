The 1.0.2 version of the NetWare Volume Imager for Linux has been
updated and is available for download at 207.109.151.240 or via our
website at www.timpanogas.com.  
The IMAGER is a tool for migrating NetWare Servers to Linux and allows
System Administrators to merge, consolidate, split, and restore
collections of NetWare volumes for server consolidation and Migration.  
Thanks to assistance and guidance from Pavel Machek, Ingo Molinar, and
Alan Cox with the Linux Raid drivers, a future release of the IMAGER
will allow Linux users to perform in-place conversions of NetWare
Volumes into EXT2 file systems on-disk when combined with the Linux RAID
drivers.  The current Windows 2000 IMAGER converts NetWare volumes into
NTFS volumes in-place (but this probably is not very useful for Linux). 
In the spirit of keeping the playing field level, we are also providing
conversion capability on Linux as well.
This version corrects a segmentation fault bug when used with GLIB on
kernels 2.2.14 and above.  The Linux NWFS utilities have also been
updated and there are now both LIBC5 and GLIB version available on the
website.  The Linux version of the IMAGER is released under the GNU
public license and is freely available and distributible on Linux.  The
Windows 2000 and DOS versions are on a 30-day license and are not
covered under the GPL.
There is some good news on the 2.2/2.3 front for the file system drivers
-- they are nearing completion for release.
