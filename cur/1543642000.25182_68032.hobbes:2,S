thank you for the clarification, Andrew. I was unclear whether the 'lock' command would block out the IPI or not.

this sounds like the most likely candidate. I'm working on tracking down documentation for further study. Is there an easy way to determine this as the cause?

I agree, that's highly doubtful.
one of our QA guys tried to reproduce this issue on an ATI card, but was unable to get through viewperf long enough to repro this problem before hitting other system lockups. I'm also installing an ATI card to try and see if I can reproduce the problem.
