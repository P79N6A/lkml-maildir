For the brightness thingy, this is known: it's the SBRT/GBRT functions
of the "SNC" ACPI device (and this seems to work for all Sony Vaios
except the ones using nvidia graphic cards, where you have to use
smartdimmer instead) 
Yu has somewhat integrated sony_acpi related functions in acpi_hotkey in
a testing patch (
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4876
) if you
like the proposed way to do it. Based on the existence of that patch,
the integration of sony_acpi into the offical kernel has been rejected
by ACPI people.
/me still wonders how hotkey.c got integrated into the kernel in its
current form...
