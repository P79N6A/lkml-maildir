   I _really_ really want to avoid this. I think POSIX is vague on the
   requirement, and quite frankly, a shared sigprocmask() is a horror. It
   really doesn't fit in, at all.
POSIX says that the behaviour of sigprocmask() is unspecified for
multi-threaded processes, so there's nothing wrong with leaving
sigprocmask() as it is.
   Basically, we can add thread groups with about 10 lines worth of diffs,
   and they will be "obviously correct". That means that if this helps
   LinuxThreads, it can happen before 2.4.0-final.
I don't think thread groups alone will help LinuxThreads right now.
Not without the proposed changes to the signal handling.
   In contrast, a shared sigprocmask() simply isn't going to happen. That is
   a 2.5.x issue, and even in 2.5.x I'd really like to avoid it, because it
   would be a design mistake, I suspect.
I think even POSIX recognizes that :-).

   I'd prefer CLONE_WAITPID, I think.
Is CLONE_WAITPID really necessary if we have CLONE_PARENT available?
Using CLONE_PARENT one can just make the initial thread the parent of
all other threads, and keep the initial thread around even after it
calls pthread_exit().  I don't think that's terribly hard to implement.
