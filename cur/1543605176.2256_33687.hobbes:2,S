I have a question on the ptrace system call
implementation:
In kernel/ptrace.c in the function access_one_page(),
why is read access denied to pages which are
marked PG_reserved ?
I have some pages in my driver which are reserved
and memory mapped to user applications which I'd
like to access in gdb.
Any clues to what is the risk if I were to enable
accessing of pages which are marked "reserved"
Thanks in advance !
Rajeev
