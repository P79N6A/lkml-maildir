Quick summary: sound now works on the ALi 5451 chip, 
but has some non-fatal error messages.

I just removed that final data set and the preceeding comma and
recompiled 2.4.12-ac6.  I'm pleased to report that the sound now works
just fine!  The module loads, and I do get some (non-fatal) error
messages, but once its loaded it runs like a champ.
BTW, I was also getting these error messages on my old 2.4.7 install. 
This is my 2.4.12-ac6 log after `modprobe trident`.  Take a look:

This hangs the system totally for about 5 seconds.  After this, it's all
fine and the sound works great.  One strange thing I notice from the
above log is the different codec IDs showing up...
Thanks,
