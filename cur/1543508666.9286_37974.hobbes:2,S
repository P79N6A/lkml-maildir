I've installed kernel 2.2.12, and the nfsd won't start with the
message: 
nfssvc: Function not inplemented
I've noticed a number of people reporting the same problem, but I
haven't seen a solution. Can anyone point me towards a solution?
Has anyone got the kernel patches for nfs to work with 2.2.12?
Michael
