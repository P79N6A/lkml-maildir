Oh, I see.  Well, if this were causing the problem, then running the GUI
at a real-time priority would be a better solution than increasing the
clock frequency, since SCHED_YIELD has no effect on real-time tasks
unless there are other runnable real-time tasks at the same priority.
The call to schedule() would just reschedule the real-time GUI task
itself immediately.
However, in times of vm stress it is more likely that GUI performance
problems would be caused by parts of the GUI having been paged out,
rather than by anything which could be helped by scheduling differences.
