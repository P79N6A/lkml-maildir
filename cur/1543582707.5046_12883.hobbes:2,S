I added memory yesterday and got it to work after having 64MB in the system.  the free
memory (cache/buffer) was over 30MB.  I didn't have any problems then.
After I got everything installed, I bumped the memory back to 48MB and it is running
fine.  I don't have the 17+MB ramdisk taking up the memory anymore, so the system has >
15MB of cache/buffer available at all times, even running ssh, sendmail, squid,
firewalling, etc.

They are on seperate controllers.  The second controller has the CD-ROM drive (32x) which
should be faster than the hard drive (since the drives are older).
