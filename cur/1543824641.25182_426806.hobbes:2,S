Hello,
following patches update pxa2xx_udc driver and ixp4xx arch depended files.
This driver will be usable on ixp4xx platform without problems.
Current state is that the pxa2xx_udc.c can't be even compiled for
the IXP4xx platform.
Feedback and comments are highly appreciated.
Best regards,
Milan Svoboda
