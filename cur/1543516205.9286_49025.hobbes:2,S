At 3am this morning, this appeared in my syslog, whilst I was asleep.
Nov 15 03:00:25 tahallah kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 912228455, count = 1

This morning when I woke up, the machine was dead, fortunately the SAK
keys worked a treat. To my horror it was unable to boot, resulting in a
file system panic (couldn't mount root filesystem!)
This evening, I banged in a rescue disk and did a e2fsck (v1.18) on the /
filesystem. Superblock was completely obliterated, but backup superblocks
were still intact, fortunately. There were a whole bunch of deleted inodes
and free block counts being wrong. There were over 150+ free blocks with
wrong counts.
I should give Ted T'ytso a big kiss for recovering my root filesystem
without having to re-install.
My /home and other partitions survived intact through the disaster. 
Now, what does the messages in my syslog means? And what could be the
cause? There were no Oops anywhere in the logs. 
(Yes, I did remove the bad SIMMs that caused find_buffer Oopsen a while
back)
Cheers, 
Alex
