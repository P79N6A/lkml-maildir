If you look at 
http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~alan/IDE
 you'll find the PATA
patches I did include some VLB and ISA devices. Providing you've got a
struct device * for whatever your SATA controller is (ie a bus model of
some sort) it is sane. If you don't then you need a couple of small
patches to allow for this, or to add device model stuff to them first. I
can send you those if need be and they are in the patches but not
seperated out.
