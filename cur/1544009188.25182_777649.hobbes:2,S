I think this is one of those cases where it's a lot harder (or uglier)
to solve a problem non-recursively than it is to solve recursively.
The basic problem is that subsystems want to prepend or append their
own data to kernel messages generated by subsystem code, and they
both want to use printf-type strings. How to combine them into a
single kernel log message without using extra memory, or double
handling of strings?
