More fun questions: what are the locking requirements for ->resize()?
You are calling it with no exclusion whatsoever...  What about
bind_rdev_to_array()?  At the very least, you want to protect
mddev->disks, and AFAICS new_dev_store() has no exclusion at all.
And I suspect that you have other things in there in need of protection
(finding free desc_nr, for one); can all of those be handled by simple
spinlocks?
