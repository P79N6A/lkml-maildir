Just to make sure we're using the same terms, do you mean the pages are marked 
dirty and on the SB's dirty list, or do you mean the page has been through 
writepage and is currently on its way to the disk?

If you mean the page is just dirty, it will get written by the 
filemap_fdatawrite calls.  If you mean the page is PG_writeback, it is 
already on the way to the disk, so it passes the 'blinking light on the 
memory stick' rule.
