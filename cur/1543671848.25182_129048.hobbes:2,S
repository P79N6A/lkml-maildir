Monopolies *can* be beaten.
The original dominator was Wordstar; when CP/M machines were replaced by 
DOS-based PCs, Wordstar failed to keep up with the trends, and was 
replaced by an easier-to-use and more capable product, Word Perfect. 
Ever try sending a legal document in anythign but Word Perfect in the 
late 1980s, and you'll know what I mean.
One upon a time, Word Perfect ruled, and Word was a new and minor player 
in the word processing market. Businesses and organizations standardized 
on Word Perfect; it was impossible to work unless you could read/write 
Word Perfect. The incompetence of Novell and Corel combined with Word's 
"better" integration with other MS products to end Word Perfect's dominance.
Historically, monopolies lose to superior competitors; it's survival of 
the fittest. Sometimes, "fittest" == least expensive -- but in most 
cases, better features, ease of use, and progressive thinking beat out 
monopolies that rest on their laurels.
Microsoft has not done anything revolutionary (or even evolutionary) 
with Word (or Windows, for that matter) in many, many years. I loved the 
original DOS-based Word, and versions of Word through about 6.0 -- then 
the bloat began, with Microsoft tacking on useless features, like an 
animal species evolving exaggerated characteristics when all other 
evolution has stopped.
Linus has the right attitude: Make Linux the best kernel possible, and 
people will use it.
The key is to meet people's needs, to be more effective in a given niche 
than the competition. But that won't happen if free software 
concentrates on cloning over bold evolution. Give Word users special 
"help", like Word gave Word Perfect users; make a strealined word 
processor that integrates modern design. Dare to be better.

Precisely.
