Here is the output from the kernels I've tested to try to get the
driver working:
2.4.4-ac6, this kernel works!

Index #1: Found a Digital DC21041 Tulip adapter at 0xd800.
Digital DC21041 Tulip chip registers at 0xd800:

 Port selection is half-duplex.
 Transmit started, Receive started, half-duplex.
  The Rx process state is 'Waiting for packets'.
  The Tx process state is 'Idle'.
  The transmit unit is set to store-and-forward.
  The NWay status register is 000001c8.
   No MII transceivers found!
  Internal autonegotiation state is 'Autonegotiation disabled'.

 Let me know if I can provide any more useful information about the
