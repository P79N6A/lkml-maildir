Blech. Invoking the random pool machinery at oops time is moderately
safe, but not very shiny. Going through all the sprintf ugliness to
format it to an irrelevant UUID standard is not very shiny either. At
least refactor it so it's not duplicating code.
And I'd much rather the static variable lived with its user, as
random.c is already too miscellaneous:

Also, please cc: me on any future patches to random.c.
