Hi,
/i386/Makefile:# Disable unit-at-a-time mode, it makes gcc use a lot morestack
/i386/Makefile:CFLAGS += $(call cc-option,-fno-unit-at-a-time)
/x86_64/Makefile:# -funit-at-a-time shrinks the kernel .text considerably
/x86_64/Makefile:CFLAGS += $(call cc-option,-funit-at-a-time)
Which solution is correct?
