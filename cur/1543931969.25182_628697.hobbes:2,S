I believe that CONFIG_SMP is uglification for you Adrian, but still I am glad 
linux have it.
If your CONFIG_SYSCTL=n is really that important for you, why dont you define 
a new qualifier that can indeed mark some variables as :
const if CONFIG_SYSCTL=n
read_mostly if CONFIG_SYCTL=y
This way you can keep compiler optimizations for your CONFIG_SYCTL=n, while 
many people like me can still continue to optimize their kernel.
Seeing so many sysctl already read_mostly in kernel, I wonder why you NACK my 
patch, while it's easy to share your concerns with other people and find a 
solution.
