Previously, it would retry capacity reading, quite by accident: the block
level did revalidation several times when faced with unexpected responses
from ub. The last one succeeded.
I'd like to secure one last favour from you. Please do this for me:
1. Connect the thing
2. Run
find /sys -name diag | xargs cat | mail -s "Flavio's ub diag" zaitcev@redhat.com
Thanks a lot,
-- Pete
