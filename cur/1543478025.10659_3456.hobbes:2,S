You are correct that the biographical info is good form.  Perhaps
Linus has an opinion on how he wants his address put?

  Linus and the rest of the Linux Kernel Development Team created
  and maintain Linux as a labor of love.  Their devotion to software
  quality has created a world-class operating system adopted by
  large enterprises, small businesses, governments, educational
  institutions, and home users alike.
Or something like that.  I think it works better as two sentences,
and I think the quality has to be tied to something concrete; as
an abstract concept only, I think it will not convey much to the
readership.
