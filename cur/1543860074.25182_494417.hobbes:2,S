I did some simple statistics about allocations happening on one CPU
and freeing on a different one. On a 4-CPU ARM system (and without IRQ
balancing and without CONFIG_PREEMPT), these seem to happen in about
8-10% of the cases. Do you expect higher figures on other
systems/configurations?
As I mentioned in a different e-mail, a way to remove the global hash
table is to create per-cpu hashes. The only problem is that in these
8-10% of the cases, freeing would need to look up the other hashes.
This would become a problem with a high number of CPUs but I'm not
sure whether it would overtake the performance issues introduced by
cacheline ping-ponging in the single-hash case.
Any thoughts?
Thanks.
