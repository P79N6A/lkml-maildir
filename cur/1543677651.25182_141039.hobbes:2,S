So counting myself, it sounds like there are at least 3 of us
experiencing a similar problem.  I didn't mention it in my original
post, but it's probably worth noting that I only started seeing this in
2.4.21.  I was running on 2.4.20 with the same setup for a long time,
and happily burning cds with magicdev running at the same time without
any trouble.
