Explain that to me.
There should *be* no resume.
ACPI doesn't suspend/resume on its own, I hope.
It is all done by the top-level suspend/resume code, not by ACPI. ACPI is 
a pure helper, and if you've changed that, then I think we need to revert 
more than a few lines.
And it's the *top*level* code that selects HOTPLUG_CPU. Through 
SUSPEND_SMP (which will select HOTPLUG_CPU) and SOFTWARE_SUSPEND.
This is why it's so *totally* and *utterly* bogus for ACPI to select 
features that it has nothign what-so-ever to do with. 
In other words: ACPI isn't in the driving seat.
