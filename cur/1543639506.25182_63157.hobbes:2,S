May I suggest that the final pte in the list of ptes for a page is
_always_ pointed to directly?
In other words, a pte_chain looks like this:
      struct page -> pte_chain -> pte_chain -> pte_chain -> pte
                          |           |            |
                          v           v            v
                          pte         pte          pte
pte_chain vs. pte would be distinguished by the least significant bit of
the pointer, or something similar.
This adds a special case in the list walker -- on the other hand, it
also removes two special cases ("PageDirect" is no longer required, and
there is no 0 to indicate end-of-list).  But the best part is: it saves
more memory, has no cache line cost, and reduces the amount of work
needed to share a page :-)
