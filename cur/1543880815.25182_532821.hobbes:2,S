I think pgprot_noncached() is needed because user mapping for a DMA
buffer (runtime->dma_area) should be uncache.  If so, doing this in
snd_pcm_mmap() looks a bit suspicious.  It seems snd_pcm_mmap_data()
is a place to do such an adjustment.  But for now, both
snd_pcm_mmap_status() and snd_pcm_mmap_control() returns -ENXIO for
MIPS so this is not a real problem.
And I wonder if VM_IO is really needed.  The area is a DMA buffer,
_not_ a memory mapped IO area, isn't it?

JFYI, there were some discussions on this topic a while ago:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/25/117
and I'v seen MIPS version of dma_mmap_coherent(), etc. somewhere...
