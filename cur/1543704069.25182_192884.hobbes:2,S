About module-init-tools ... dunno ... never heard of it, I'm on Slackware 9.1 
so ... dunno ... Not sure. But like you say, if i could not initalize modules 
the nvidia module should be the least of my worries, plus everything loads in 
2.4.22

on make install i get:
FATAL: Error inserting nvidia (/lib/modules/2.6.1/kernel/drivers/video/
nvidia.ko): Invalid module format
That's the same thing that modprobe nvidia gets. 
I'll check the nv thing out.
One interesting error / warning i get during boot is this (from /var/log/
syslog) :
Jan 22 10:43:08 stormcrow kernel: nvidia: version magic '2.6.1 preempt K7 
gcc-3.2' should be '2.6.1 preempt K7 gcc-3.3'
Jan 22 10:46:15 stormcrow kernel: nvidia: version magic '2.6.1 preempt K7 
gcc-3.2' should be '2.6.1 preempt K7 gcc-3.3'
Not sure what to make of this. I know that 4496 had issues with the gcc 
version i was running a while backed, and i had to hack the installer script 
to ignore that (though i'm sure there is a switch for this stuff ... i was 
over reading at that point).
As for the XFree log ... i don't have that one ...
