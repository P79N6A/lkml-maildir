No you have not explained why the theoretical issues continue to exist 
given even just considering Lumpy Reclaim in .23 nor what effect the 
antifrag patchset would have. And you have used a 2M pagesize which is 
irrelevant to this patchset that deals with blocksizes up to 64k. In my 
experience the use of blocksize < PAGE_COSTLY_ORDER (32k) is reasonably 
safe.
