I need to sit down with JG, AC, BZ, JA and work out a TF <> FIS lib for
First Party DMA.
I need to rip the SATA 1.0 out of drivers/ide/* and move it to a
scsi-sata.c,h and create a sas.c,h then generate a sata-sas-lib.c,h
solution.  Then abstract way the timings and setups to the scsi-template.
Obviously TCQ in FPDMA via direct FIS will map to SCSI with less pain.
I have FPDMA cores.
Cheers,
