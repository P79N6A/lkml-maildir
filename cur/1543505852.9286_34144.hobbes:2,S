No, that's fine. That's exactly the kind of explanation I would have
expected, and I think it's actually _nice_ that /proc kind of shows both
parts of the picture - no point in making the driver claim the whole
window if it's only using half of it.
It's not as if the resource allocation protects against _bad_ users
anyway: if somebody wants to mess with the IO registers he could just do
so directly without bothering to try to allocate it as a busy resource. So
there's no worry that some "bad" driver would try to access the card using
the upper half - if somebody does something that silly on purpose, then
it's not your problem, and you can't force him to behave by just marking
the whole region used.
The PCI resource has been corectly identified, and as such there won't be
anybody trying to allocate the area in question for any other bus.
