FYI, I'm using a printer daisy-chained to a backpack CDROM drive
and pass-through sort of works in 2.2.5-ac6. Sort of because I
can access the CDROM or the printer, but not simultaneously. If
I access the CDROM while printing, for example, the printer
immediately stops.
I'm just relating this as anecdotal evidence that the
pass-through code is not entirely broken. Heck, maybe even
simultaneous access works and I'm only doing something wrong
(e.g. the lp driver uses irq 7 while the paride/bpck/pcd modules
appear to be polling in 4bit mode...)
I'm about to re-subscribe to the parport mailing list, but how
many mailing lists can one subscribe to before losing total
control of incoming e-mail?
Cheers
Steffen.
