I'm not quite sure. My info were from time of first intel smp's when
bandwidth to main memory was the limit. I'm sure you can get 100%
improvement for benchmarks (when benchmarks fit into on-cpu cache),
but for a real load it is not _that_ good. And because SMP has cost of
increased locking etc, there were cases when it slowed down.
Has your experimence have something to do with web/file serving and/or
other io intensive op?
