Hi, I don't have a solution to your problem unfortunately, just want
to give you a bit of advice.
1) Try searching the archives and google a bit for info before posting
(and when you do post, make it clear that you've done so). As it turns
out this problem has surfaced before and there are several
interresting threads on the subject - here are a few I found (there
are others) :
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/8/4
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2005-06/3234.html
http://www.mhonarc.org/archive/html/procmail/2006-06/msg00140.html
2) If you find previous posts related to your problem you'll often see
requests for specific info in them (like Andi asking "... catch a
crash in gdb and type x/i $pc what do you see?" in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/8/17
 ). Try to provide such info in your
initial post - it'll greatly enhance your chances of getting useful
replies (and/or getting the bug fixed).
3) Please read the REPORTING-BUGS document in the root of the kernel
source dir and provide the info it outlines - usually saves a bunch of
ping-pong mails back and forth asking for more info.
4) Try to add people who may have an insight into the problem to Cc: -
looking at previous threads on the subject and finding the people who
have previously shown an interrest is usually a good starting point.
The right people may miss your report if you only send to LKML.
