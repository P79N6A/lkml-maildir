The bug with truncate in the fat filesystem that was present in 2.4.0,
and fixed with the 2.4.0-ac12 (or earlier) patch is still in the main
(unpatched) kernel, both 2.4.1 and 2.4.2.  The problem is that I cannot
apply the 2.4.0-ac patch to the newer kernels and I cannot patch up to
2.4.1 from 2.4.0 if I already applied the ac patch (so I obviously can't
get to 2.4.2).  I also can't patch from 2.4.0-ac12 to 2.4.1-ac20 using
only ac patches.  Neither of the ac patches for 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 have
this fix for fat, so giving the '-R' option to patch took away the fix.
I would be happy to extract the fix from 2.4.0-ac12, but I am not a
kernel developer and am not sure how many files were changed to fix this
bug.
I want to move up to 2.4.2 for the reiserfs updates and then eventually
to at least 2.4.2-ac2 for the loopback fix (but need the fat
functionality too).
Thanks for any help or suggestions.
