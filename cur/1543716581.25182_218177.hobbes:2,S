Hello,
It seems that linux  2.6.5 has some problems with my USB ports...
See config-1, dmesg-1.
Whatever I connect to the USB ports, I see no reaction at all.
If I boot my computer with USB modem beeing attached, both controllers are 
initialized but I have dmesg-2 call trace during ALSA initialisation!
Anyway my sound card never worked under linux, see
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2543
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0311.1/0081.html
Looks like linux can not initialize my PCI devices correctly?
What can be wrong? I will be glad to test and debug! So if you have any ideas 
how to fix the problems, please tell me!
With best wishes,
Alexander.
