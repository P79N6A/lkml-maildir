poll(), as was already noted. Program below should
print same value for B= and F=, but it reports f + 8*c instead
(where c = number of filedescriptors passed to poll).
And you must call it from assembly, as your calls to getpid() or
ioctl() (or poll()) are wrapped in libc - and glibc's code begins with
push %ebx because of %ebx is used by -fPIC code.
It is questinable whether we should try to not modify parameters
passed into functions. It is definitely nice behavior, but I think
that we should only guarantee that syscalls do not modify unused
registers.
