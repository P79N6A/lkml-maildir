It's not really frequency information.  If a page is accessed 1000 
times during a single schedule cycle, that will count as a single 
increment in the age come the time.  However, *macro* frequency 
information of this type *is* useful in the case where thrashing is 
taking place.  You want to swap out the page that is accessed only 
once every other schedule cycle, before the one accessed every cycle. 
This is of course moot if one process is being suspended (as it 
probably should), but the criteria for suspension might include this 
access information.
