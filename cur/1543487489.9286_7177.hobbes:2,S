Since I am not a hacker, sorry if this makes no sense.
The fact of having a system's configuration scattered in multiple files 
and directories in /etc makes difficult configuration and multiple 
configuration management.
My idea is to keep all the configuration contents in a file situated in 
/dev, and mount it as a TXT filesystem in /etc.
For example:
The file /dev/Config.txt contents:
#Begin file(system)
./-rw-r--r--   1 root     root          185 Feb 22  1997 fstab
/dev/hda2 / ext2 defaults 0 1
/proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
/dev/hda3 none swap defaults 0 0
#
/dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy ext2 defaults,noauto 0 0
#
/dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom iso9660 ro,noauto 0 0
./-rw-------   1 root     root          484 Feb 29  1996 ftpaccess
#More stuff....
#End of file(system)
It would be seen, when mounted, mount -t TXT /dev/Config.txt /etc, of 
course, exactly as it is seen in any current system.
But, when it comes to copy, clone, modify, analyze or whatever a 
system's configuration, it would be as easy as you would only have to 
worry about /dev/Config.txt, if you choose to treat the configuration as 
a file. For all the existing applications, it wouldn't make a 
difference. It is obvious that the kernel should mount this filesystem 
FIRST to anything else.
I don't know if ./ would be good for identifying the line as a file 
name, path and etc.. I suppose more information would be needed in that 
text line.
The TXT filesystem only would mount text files, and its content would 
only be plain text files. Only small-medium file(systems) would be 
considered.
Thank you for your patience.
Sorry again if this is a waste of bandwith.
