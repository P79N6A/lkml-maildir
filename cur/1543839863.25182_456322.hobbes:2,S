Odd - asm/cpufeature.h is being included by asm/processor.h, which is included by
linux/sched.h, which in turn I would have assumed is included by virtually everything.
The simply solution would be to explicitly include it from asm/alternative.h - could you
give that a try? Regardless of that I'd be curious what source file under kernel/ (and
perhaps with what .config) neither includes linux/sched.h nor asm/processor.h.
