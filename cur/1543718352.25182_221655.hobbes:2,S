I've been comparing kernel compile stats online to those I get 
on my own machine, and I am baffled.
Kernel compiles take 6m38s on my P4 2.8GHz (with HT enabled) and 
512 MB RAM as compared to 20-30 seconds reported by folks online. 
I am running kernel 2.6.6.
While I understand that this varies with the config, I also don't 
see why it should vary so much.  Does anyone have any pointers on 
how I could best troubleshoot my performance?
