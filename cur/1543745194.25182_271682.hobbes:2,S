Right, I had not looked at it in detail. I just reacted to the claim 
that "it does exactely the same" but I could see in the posted patch 
that it didn't do exactely the same and there was no explanation of why 
it was ok to have that difference.
After reading move_addr_to_kernel(), I agree that the patch looks fine.
