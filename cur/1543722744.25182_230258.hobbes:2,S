You will still hit the stack in the case of netconsole, since it doesn't
register an rx hook and netif_receive_skb has this:
#ifdef CONFIG_NETPOLL_RX
	if (skb->dev->netpoll_rx && skb->dev->poll && netpoll_rx(skb)) {
		kfree_skb(skb);
		return NET_RX_DROP;
	}
#endif
So we fall through and end up calling code which doesn't want to run in
interrupt context.
One solution that I've come up with, but may not be in the spirit of
netpoll, is to change that test above to the following:
	if (unlikely(netpoll_trap())) {
		if (skb->dev->netpoll_rx && skb->dev->poll)
			netpoll_rx(skb);
		kfree_skb(skb);
		return NET_RX_DROP;
	}
This changes semantics, in that the rx routine will only be called if we've
decided to "trap" the network stack.  Note also that this will cause us to
drop packets while doing our logging.
Matt, any thoughts on this?

Jeff
