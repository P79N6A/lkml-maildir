When does the lockup occur? When mounting? Later? What is the command that 
triggers it?
Could you edit fs/ntfs/Makefile and remove the hash in front of the -DDEBUG 
in the EXTRA_CFLAGS line? Then recompile, insert the module and as root issue:
echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug
This will activate extensive logging in NTFS. If you now can reproduce the 
hang and send me the syslog output (which hopefully will be captured) I 
should be able to figgure out where and why it crashes.
Thanks in advance,
         Anton
