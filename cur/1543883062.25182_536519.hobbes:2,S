tifm is the name of the "monolithic blob" that I test :).

I believe is the relevant part:
~$ lsmod | grep "mmc\|tifm"
tifm_sd                11272  0
mmc_core               25812  1 tifm_sd
tifm_7xx1               6848  0
tifm_core               9876  2 tifm_sd,tifm_7xx1
Since there are [tifm_*] in lsmod; modprobe tifm is no run.
Can you successfully run this test with -mm tree? I that case
the fault may be hardware related.
