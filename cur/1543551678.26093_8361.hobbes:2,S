There is a bug in gcc-2.7.2.3.  It incorrectly lays out
structure initialisers when the `name:value;' construct is used.
Here is the degenerate case:
	struct struct_1 { int a; };
	struct thing {
	        int a;
	        struct struct_1 b;
	};
	struct thing a_thing = {
	//      a: 0,		/* Uncomment this for correct code */
	        b: {0},
	};
Which produces:
	        .file   "e.c"
	        .version        "01.01"
	gcc2_compiled.:
	.globl a_thing
	.data
	        .align 4
	        .type    a_thing,@object
	        .size    a_thing,8
	a_thing:
	        .zero   4
	        .zero   4
	        .long 0
	        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 2.7.2.3"
Note the extra `.zero 4'.
As far as I can tell the rule to follow is this:
     If a structure has nested structures, and if you are
     initialising one of the nested structures then you
     _must_ initialise all fields which precede that nested
     structure.
There are five ways to fix this:
1: Remember to initialise all fields which precede
   initialised structures.
2: Arrange your struct so that all nested structs come first
   and remember to initialise them all.
3: Don't use gcc-2.7.2.3 (use one of the later compilers and
   put up with 50% longer build times).
4: Fix gcc-2.7.2.3
5: Don't use named initialisers.
David, your recent changes to tcp_ipv4.c make 2.7.2.3-compiled
kernels fail very strangely.  I used option 2 to fix it:
