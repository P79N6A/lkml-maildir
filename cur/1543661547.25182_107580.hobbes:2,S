Hi All,
We have a 2.4.20 Dual Athlon. It has been working
fine for quite some time, however today it just crashed, 
i could ping it fine, but no tcp connections were getting
through, also the console was dead, i couldn't even break 
out of the screen blanker to see what the problem was.
CTRL-ALT-DEL didn't do anything either, had to hard reset
it.
Logs dont show anything, just the usual "sa" cron job as the 
last entry. Is there anyway to find out exactly why it crashed?
Btw: this was a Redhat 7.3, and its main job was NFS.
If you need more info just ask.
Thanks
Dave
