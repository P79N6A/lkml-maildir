Please resend in plain text.  My recommendations...
1. If you can setup a linux machine with working MTA, use
git-format-patch and git-send-email.  If you don't feel comfortable with
git, you can use mutt + your favorite editor (I use emacs).
2. Use firefox + external editor plugin with line-wrap turned off.
Thanks.
