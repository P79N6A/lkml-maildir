	Hi all, i got two questions:
	I just read about this Vesa think know being supported in the
kernel, i have heard friends saying that this think improves graphics in
windows 9x...they told me all i required was that my graphic board is
vesa-compatible.....i got a Cirrus logic 5446 on and i586 machine....know
it is a good idea that i compile the kernel with vesa support...will it be
usefull ??? doesn't have any problem with XFree ??? (i use version
3.3.3.1)
	And talking about the SB AWE64, i haven't been able to make the
AWE table work, awe_wave says it doesn't dettect it and i tried
uncommenting the lines in awe_config.h about the base io address and the
DRAM size, it prints <SoundBlaster EMU..blabla> then i load a font with
sfxload and try drvmidi but there isn't any sound, playmidi says something
like no playback device found aborting.....What can it be ??...the other
modules load well and detect the card, Could it be that the card has
enabled the mpu-401 uart, i read in the manuall that it's disabled setting
a jumpper ??? Acording to OSS/Comercial my card is a Creative SB AWE64 PnP
type 4
	Thanks for your answers !!!!!
