Is there any word on when the IDE driver will support isapnp?
I happen to have a i486 with 3 PnP devices (modem, nic and sb vibra16). My
problem is that the BIOS has no idea about PnP. At the moment, I have to
rely on a DOS PnP driver to set everything up then use loadlin to boot
Linux. I am also using the IDE port on the sb for my /usr, /home, and for
my CDROM, which means I need the IDE driver to be able to find that IDE
channel. I would love to be able to ditch the last remnant of M$ on this
system.
I tried booting 2.3.33 with isapnp configured but it wouldn't recognize
the IDE channel (or the sb for that matter). That, of course, rendered the
system unusable since /usr was not available.
