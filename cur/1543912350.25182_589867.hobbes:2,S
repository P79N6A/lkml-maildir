Jeff,
I'm resubmitting the cxgb3 dev->priv issue.
I'm also submitting a patch fixing the engine microcode loading.
The first patch changes in both cxgb3 and iw_cxgb3 related to
the dev->priv issue.
The second patch allows the driver to load the engine microcode
at the right time - when a port is brought up as opposed to
the module getting loaded. It does a better job at logging
the loading activity, and loosen the strict version requirement
currently in place.
Cheers,
Divy
