The problem seems to be that sparse currently will only accept array
declarations with a size that can be evaluated at compile time to
a fixed value.  So an array declaration of the form:
int asize;
int data[asize];
will fail.  sparse needs to be modified to recognize this type of 
declaration with a variable array size.  That'll take a few hours of
someone's time to fix.
