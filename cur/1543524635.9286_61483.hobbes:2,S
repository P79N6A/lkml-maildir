the comment is outdated:
try_to_swap_out() is called with vmlist_access_lock()'ed, and it unlocks
that lock before sleeping. However, it calls flush_tlb_page() before
releasing that lock.
vmlist_access_lock is a define:
#define vmlist_access_lock(mm)	spin_lock(&mm->page_table_lock)
That lock was added around 2.3.2x to close races between concurrent
swap-outs and other mm operations such as mprotect: unlike 2.2,
mprotect() now runs without lock_kernel().
