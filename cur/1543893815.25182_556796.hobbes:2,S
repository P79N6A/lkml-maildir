Replacing the timeslice boost with sched-rr would probably be an ok
cleanup, but I'm unsure if it risks to break the other RT tasks
(especially when folks misuse a soft-RT design to do hard-RT work,
with userland drivers running with RT privilege mapping iommu
regions).
Most cpus goes idle as soon as the oom killer is entered so it
probably doesn't make much difference anyway. I didn't remove the
timeslice hack just because there wasn't any compelling reason to
remove it but it's probably not making much difference.
