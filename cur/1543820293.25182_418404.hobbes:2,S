Thanks for sources. The problem is, they still use deprecated api, they still
pci_find_device, despite I applied them to correct it and they promise to at
least try their best, unfortunately with no effect :(. I guess, if they don't
convert it to pci probing, the driver won't be altered (delete 'if LINUXVERSION'
and so on) to be re-merged as a new version.
The driver needs to be rewritten as a whole (macros, whitespace, probing, maybe
it missed some new tty api changes and so on). Maybe I get into that on summer
holidays or somebody may do so earlier, but merging driver in present state is
maybe unwanted.
regards,
