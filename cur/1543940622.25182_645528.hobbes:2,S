That is a very good question.  Andreas Gruenbacher had some patches
for fixing behavior of /proc/mounts under a chroot, but people are
paranoid about userspace ABI changes (unwarranted in this case, IMO).

Anyway, if we are going to have a new 'mountinfo' file, this could be
easily fixed as well.

We also discussed this with Karel, maybe it didn't make it onto lkml.
The proposed solution was to store the "loop" flag separately in a
file under /var.  It could just be an empty file for each such loop
device:
  /var/lib/mount/loops/loop0
This file is created by mount(8) if the '-oloop' option is given.  And
umount(8) automatically tears down the loop device if it finds this
file.

I think a full replacement is perfectly feasible, just needs some more
work on the userspace side.

The unprivileged mounts patches do contain a simple form of access
control.  I don't think anything more is needed, but of course, having
unprivileged mounts in the kernel does not prevent the use of a more
sophisticated access control daemon in userspace, if that becomes
necessary.
