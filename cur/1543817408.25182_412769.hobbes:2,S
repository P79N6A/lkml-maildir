True. But it is my impression that this is a problem isolated on the
client side (am I wrong?)

Do you mean NFS exporting a local filesystem, NFS mounting it again on
the local host?   Or do you mean something with loopback mounts?
(Sorry if that's a stupid question, but I just need to know what you
mean :)

True.
I've currently tried compiling the kernel with three different gcc
versions to see if that made any change. It didn't. And I tried SMP
versus UP, again no difference. I'm just about to try HIGHMEM vs no
HIGHMEM...
Thanks for your suggestion - I will try it, if you tell me precisely
what you mean in the above  :)
