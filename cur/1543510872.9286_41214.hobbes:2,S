In Australia you also need to have approved ("Austel Approved") equipment even 
on a PABX.  Even mobile phones (or hand phones/cell phones, depending what part
of the world you are in) must be Austel Approved or you risk a massive fine.
I believe it is the same in many countries.
My Xircom CEM336 'global' modem (and ethernet) has a large number of approvals 
both on the PCMCIA card and on the modem dongle itself.  I believe that's the
only difference between the 'global' and the 'normal' models, but it makes for
a significant price difference in order to make the thing legal in a large 
number of countries.
