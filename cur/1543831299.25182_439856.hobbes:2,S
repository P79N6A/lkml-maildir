Well you could patch the affected plugin's .dynstr table so that it should at
best try to call a function that has not yet been defined somewhere else (like
open); IOW, you change the .dynstr entry from 'open' to say 'my_open', and
regularly include libmy.so through e.g. LD_PRELOAD.
Of course the MD5 won't match afterwards, but I think the plugin should execute
as usual afterwards, since .dynstr is something no app should rely on.
