It booted fine _with_ the patch applied, with DEBUG_MUTEXES=y and n.
Boutcher, to be clear, you can't boot with kernel-kernel-cpuc-to-mutexes.patch 
applied and DEBUG_MUTEXES=y ?
But if you revert kernel-kernel-cpuc-to-mutexes.patch it boots ok?
This is looking quite similar to another hang we're seeing on Power4 iSeries
