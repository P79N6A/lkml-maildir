Hi,
I have put up two more patches for nfsd3 and nlm4 support for 2.2.13 at
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/nfs3/download
nfsd3_nlm4_2.2.13.patch is for nfsd and nlm4 support based on Allen Morris's 
work along with nlm4 support. 
nlm4_linux2.2.13.patch is for just the nlm4 stuff.
The former should be applied after applying Trond's client patch and the 
latter after applying Trond's client patch and Neil Brown's server patch 
(in that order). 
thanks,
Saadia
