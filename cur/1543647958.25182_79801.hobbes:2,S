This cannot be the reason for your problem. The name of a structure
member has no connection whatsoever with the name of any function or
definition.
The following code will correctly write "Hello world!" to the screen
even though the text initializes a member of a structure called "current"
while "current" has been defined to be a function called puts.
#include <stdio.h>
#define current puts
struct foo {
    char *current;
    int foo;
    } bar; 
main()
{
    bar.current = "Hello world!";
    current(bar.current);
    return 0;
}
For your code to get "confused", you really have something else
wrong. That said, some name-space polution may make it difficult
to find the problem. For instance, a structure member is expected
to have a ";" after it. It's possible for some previous definition
to make a syntax error invisible.
Cheers,
