	hi all,
	i hope alan read this mail, or maybe others could help me
	on this one.
	i have the need to utilize the traffic shaper for one of
	my server. (btw, we use linux based system to monitor
	the election in my country, cool huh?)
	downloaded alan's shaper-15 and worked around the compiling
	problem (must be a too old hacks).
	i did this:
	ifconfig eth0 down
	insmod shaper
	shapecfg attach shaper0 eth0
	shapecfg speed shaper0 131072
	ifconfig shaper0 myhost broadcast bla.bla.bla netmask the.mask
	when i ping the outside world everything freeze...
	kernel 2.2.7
	please cc me, my exploder is down right now.
	tia.
	imel...
