Ugh!!! The reason I reworked the console system is because over the years
hack after hack has been added. It now has lead to this twisted monster.
Take a look at the fbdev driver codes in 2.4.X. Instead of another hack
the console system should be cleaned up with a well thought out design to
make the code base smaller and more effiencent.
