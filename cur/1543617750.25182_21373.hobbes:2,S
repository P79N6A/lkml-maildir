On my dual PPro, /proc/pci shows :
  Bus  0, device   2, function  0:
    Non-VGA unclassified device: Intel Corp. 82375EB (rev 21).
      Master Capable.  Latency=248.  
This is a PCI-EISA bridge.

I have two of this kind : This dual Pentium Pro (Nec motherboard), and
a Digital AlphaServer 1000.
Most high-end Pentium-Pro motherboard had both PCI and EISA slots.

        Marc.
