Well, I'd be surprised to see that SecureWare port to Linux.  Or really
any other label-based MAC implementations at all - how many different
ones does Linux need?
Meanwhile, SELinux does implement MAC checks, and those checks do not
require an external privilege mechanism like capabilities and won't be
overridden by your shiny new capability.  Which makes me uneasy about
calling it CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE.  Explain it to a user - this capability is
for overriding MAC checks, except for SELinux.  Or AppArmor or TOMOYO
or ... if you also count them as MAC (depending on your definition of
it).
What the capability does is override the MAC checks in Smack.  And since
you don't seem to need more than one such capability for Smack, calling
it CAP_SMACK_OVERRIDE makes sense to me.

Given that the capability module is implemented via LSM, the above makes
no sense - a LSM is free to tweak the capability bits or change what
capable() returns already.  The fact that we don't presently do so is
another matter.
