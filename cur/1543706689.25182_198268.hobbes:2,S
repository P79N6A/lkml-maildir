It goes wrong.  This happens both with filesystems that know nothing
about encodings, e.g. ext3, and filesystems that need to be told what
to transcode to/from utf-8, e.g. ntfs.
It is also a problem that some applications access the filesystem
assuming utf-8 and some don't.  Nothing in the filesystem can make the
different applications cooperate regarding these.  E.g. I have
filenames that look fine in "ls" containg things like c-cedilla, but
xmms displays them wrongly.
