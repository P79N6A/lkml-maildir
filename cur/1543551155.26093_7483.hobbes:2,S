I believe I sent the successful report to Kurt, but just in case,
the latest tmscsim driver from the web page worked just fine.
In my case, it negotiated the sync transfer with the hard disks
successfully while it didn't with the old async CD drive.
Expected correct behavior.
This is with 2.4.0-test9.(Oh, I think when I reported to Kurt, it
was test9-prexxx, but it now works with test-9 on my PC.)
I would like to thank Kurt for continueing to maintain
the old tmscsim driver for the new kernel.
Happy Hacking,
Chiaki Ishikawa
