I thought some of that (and surely more to follow) has been
incorporated.

(well, its not my design - I'm just trying to see how far we can push it
out of sheer curiosity)
This has to be done anyway, and getting it wrong in userspace is just as
bad no? 
The _ONLY_ technical argument I've seen to do this in userspace is that
these tables and text segments are unswappable in-kernel - which doesn't
count too heavily in my book.

Again, I appreciate the fact that multi-dimensional constraint solving
isn't easy. But any which way we turn this thing, it still needs to be
done.

How is updating a kernel module (esp one that only contains constraint
tables) more difficult than upgrading a user-space library? That just
doesn't make sense.

Talking with my community hat on, that is an artificial problem created
by distributions, tell them to fix it.
All it requires is a new kernel module that describes the new chip,
surely that can be shipped as easily as a new library.

You're talking to LKML here - we don't care about stuff older than -git
(well, only a little, but not much more beyond n-1).
What we do care about is technical arguments, and last time I checked,
hardware resource scheduling was an OS level job.
But if the PMU control is critical to the enterprise deployment of
$customer, then he would have to re-certify on the library update too.
If its only development phase stuff, then the deployment machines won't
even load the module so there'd be no problem anyway.
