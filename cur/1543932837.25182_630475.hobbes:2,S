Subject: [patch 29/47] crypto: move s390 Kconfig options.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/20/293

From: Jan Glauber <jan.glauber@de.ibm.com>
Move s390 crypto Kconfig options to drivers/crypto/Kconfig to have all
hardware crypto devices in one place.
This also makes messing up the kernel source tree easier for some people.
