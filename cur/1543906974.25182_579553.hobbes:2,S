Actually, we can do most of that stuff already. 
We can encrypt filesystems, encrypt swaps (LVM), and encrypt hibernation.
What we _can't_ do is to hibernate on LVM encrypted partition, and we
could only suspend to swap partition. Bad combination, but here's way
out: just use separate (raw) partition for hibernation.
Ok, that needs re-partitioning; if that's bad, just swapoff before
hibernation and mkswap/swapon after its done.
