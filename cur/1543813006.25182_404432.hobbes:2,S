Well, the problem with the new interrupt code is that it does
local_irq_enable() before return from interrupt.
I don't know exactly why it breaks with the MILO PALcode. I'd guess
that if an interrupt occurs during 'call_pal rti' execution, some
critical PALcode data gets corrupted.
Fixed thus.
Ivan.
