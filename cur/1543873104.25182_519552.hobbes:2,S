If you've got a tree that looks like:
 --a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h->
    \           /
     i-j-k-l-m-n
where h is bad but both g and n are good, you can try testing the
merge of g+k, etc. Which will find half the problem. Then you can do
the same on the other side. Tedious.
The best way to debug resume issues directly seems to be to do a fake
suspend, possibly with filtering out particular devices:
