 Yeah, I know, and some of my serial numbers are too close together
for comfort but I still like everything matched up:
hde: MAXTOR 4K060H3, ATA DISK drive
hdg: MAXTOR 4K060H3, ATA DISK drive
hdi: MAXTOR 4K060H3, ATA DISK drive
 hde: hde1 hde2 hde3 hde4 < hde5 hde6 hde7 hde8 hde9 >
 hdg: hdg1 hdg2 hdg3 hdg4 < hdg5 hdg6 hdg7 hdg8 hdg9 >
 hdi: hdi1 hdi2 hdi3 hdi4 < hdi5 hdi6 hdi7 hdi8 hdi9 >
