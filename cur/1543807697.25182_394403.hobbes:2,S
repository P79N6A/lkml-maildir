mdadm.conf doesn't need to, and normally shouldn't, list the devices
that compose an array (though it can if you want it to).
A typical mdadm.conf should look something like:
   DEVICES /dev/hd* /dev/sd*
   ARRAY /dev/md0 UUID=some:long:uuid
   ARRAY /dev/md1 UUID=some:other:long:uuid
So I think we are actually in agreement.

Maybe I should be explicit about what I am against.
I am against the practice of choosing devices to assemble into arrays
based simply on a partition type - and assembling them into whatever
arrays they appear to comprise.
A device should not be able to say "pick me, pick me!".  Something
*outside* the array should say "pick all devices matching X", where X
is some arbitrary predicate, that could involve partition type
information if you like, but importantly should be precise enough not
to choose wrongly in any but very exceptional circumstances.
I am *not* against 'autoassemble' in the sense that some process hunts
through available devices trying to find the components for a give md
array: It was primarily to achieve this that I wrote mdadm.  I just
want the 'autoassemble' to be driven by some external description of
the array(s) - e.g. uuid.
I don't accept your argument that partition types are of interest
because array components could still have their superblock after being
retargeted.  This is because
  - running "mdadm --zero-superblock" is as easy as changing the
    partition type, and equally, both are easy to forget to do.
  - If you have retargeted devices in an array, you presumably don't
    put the UUID of that array anywhere that would encourage mdadm to
    assemble it.  So the fact that the UUID won't be recognised is
    just as good at stopping the array from being assembled as that
    fact that the partition type has been changed.
This doesn't mean I am violently against partition types (and for
legacy support, we need to use them).  I just don't see a lot of value
in using them.
