also most of the architectures that do bigpage-for-kernel stuff only
have a very limited number of tlb entries for bigpages (usually 2 to 4)
while they have many more entries for normal pages.. so it's not
automatically worse (now if these data structures are close to the
kernel text or so.. then yes there's sharing. but with the sorting of
kernel text that's a lot less true already)
