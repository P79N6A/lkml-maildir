Subject: [PATCH 007 of 8] knfsd: nfsd4: vary maximum delegation limit based on RAM size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@fieldses.org>
Our original NFSv4 delegation policy was to give out a read delegation
on any open when it was possible to.
Since the lifetime of a delegation isn't limited to that of an open, a
client may quite reasonably hang on to a delegation as long as it has
the inode cached.  This becomes an obvious problem the first time a
client's inode cache approaches the size of the server's total memory.
Our first quick solution was to add a hard-coded limit.  This patch
makes a mild incremental improvement by varying that limit according to
the server's total memory size, allowing at most 4 delegations per
megabyte of RAM.
My quick back-of-the-envelope calculation finds that in the worst case
(where every delegation is for a different inode), a delegation could
take about 1.5K, which would make the worst case usage about 6% of
memory.  The new limit works out to be about the same as the old on a
1-gig server.
