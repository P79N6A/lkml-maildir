RU seems the latest. Flashed bios as per your nicely detailed
instructions.
No improvement in condition, alas.

Err. "300(66)" probably won't help too much. The cpu's are multiplier
locked (love that one, Intel); so will run at 7 * 66 (466) when set to
chip defaults - which I currently am - to rule out flaky / stressed
hardware.
Temperatures are a nice frosty 30 deg C across all the temperature
sensors lm_sensors offers; and the thermal probe I have dangling in the
psu exhaust :)
[this is with two rc5des clients running - loadavg of 2 - btw]
Back to the original topic, I've done some more 'research'; and I'm not
_certain_ of my findings, but there's a few coincidences here...
I think I'll make a more general post to lkml direct in a minute.
