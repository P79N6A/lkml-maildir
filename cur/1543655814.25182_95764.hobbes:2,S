Hmm. If the called notifiers sleep, RCU can't prevent the notifiers
from being unregistered while they are executing. I suppose then that
RCU is not suitable for generic notifiers. It may still be useful
for managing notifiers in very fast paths where acquiring a
read lock may be undesirable (like the oprofile's NMI handler).
Instead of a lockless __notifier_call_chain, I would rather add
a notifier_call_chain_safe() to avoid changing the existing
handlers. Something like the patch below.
The safe version should be used for the trap handlers: we know
that the called notifiers will not sleep and the smp-safeness 
makes the handlers simpler.
Thanks,
Vamsi.
