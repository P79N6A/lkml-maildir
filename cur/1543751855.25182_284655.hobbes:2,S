Maybe the current code is _deliberately_ accepting interruption by 
signals but trying to complete sbp2_probe() anyway. However it seems 
more plausible to me to abort the device probe, for example like this:
if (msleep_interruptible(1000)) {
	sbp2_remove_device(scsi_id);
	return -EINTR;
}
Anyway, signal handling does not appear to be critical there.
