Subject: [PATCH][DOC] Console is utf-8 by default
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/3/214

The console is now by default in UTF-8 mode.
Also fix the needed "vt." prefix.

This documentation fix really deserves going into 2.6.24, else we'll
probably get a lot of bug reports like
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9319
(not that we won't have any...). Maybe that should even be announced in
a more highlighted place?
