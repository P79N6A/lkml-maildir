Roman claimed it produced better code, and the values are functionally
clocksource specific (meaning if the clocksource changed, and they were
global, you would have to reset them anyway).
I think logically those values are more timekeeping oriented then
clocksource oriented, but one could argue that since we manipulate
clocksource.mult in the timekeeping's NTP code, mult is timekeeping
specific as well.
If you really wanted a clean design, you'd probably have to keep all of
those values as a timekeeping_clocksource struct, and then have smaller
clocksource structs (name, mult, shift, read) that is filled in by the
clocksource driver and copied over on clocksource changes. That way the
timekeeping code wouldn't manipulate the clocksource structure directly.
But really, it seems like work for little to no reward (plus opens the
issue of "but i want a ntp frequency adjusted sched_clock!" which would
not be possible).
