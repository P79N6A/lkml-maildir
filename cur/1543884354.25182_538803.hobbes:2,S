It seems you are expecting too much of SO_BROADCAST option.
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/xsh_chap02_10.html
SO_BROADCAST :
Non-zero requests permission to transmit broadcast datagrams (SOCK_DGRAM sockets only).
Note this only handles the transmission of packets, not receiving them.
