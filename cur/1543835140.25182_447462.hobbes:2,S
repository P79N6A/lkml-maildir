AFAIK, ondemand implements the following.
Many times per second, do the following:
	Calculate CPU usage since last check.
	If CPU usage > high threshold, set frequency to maximum.
	If CPU usage < low threshold, lower frequency by one level.
So it will immediately jump to the highest frequency, in order to
provide low latency, but will slowly decrease it until it finds the
lowest frequency that provides enough CPU power to support the current
load.
Personally, I prefer conservative, because it isn't as "jumpy", but I
can see ondemand being necessary in a server environment where the
several second lag time to peak performance would hurt response time
when load is low.
