Sorry, but why this operation is needed? Generic code (in fs/*.c)
doesn't use ->i_blksize at all. If XFS wants to provide per-inode
st_blksize, all it has to do is to store preferred buffer size in its
file system specific inode (struct xfs_inode), and use something
different from generic_fillattr() as its ->i_op->getattr() callback
(xfs_vn_getattr()).
