Right and thats fine because of:
        /*
         * On SMP, boot_cpu_data holds the common feature set between
         * all CPUs; so make sure that we indicate which features are
         * common between the CPUs.  The first time this routine gets
         * executed, c == &boot_cpu_data.
         */
        if (c != &boot_cpu_data) {
                /* AND the already accumulated flags with these */
                for (i = 0 ; i < NCAPINTS ; i++)
                        boot_cpu_data.x86_capability[i] &= c->x86_capability[i];
        }
