To feel anything like the original the new getblk has to be idempotent: 
subsequent calls return the same block.
Another issue: we need to be able to find the appropriate mapping for the 
getblk.  That means either looking it up in yet another [major][minor] vector 
or changing the type of the argument to getblk, which is not as painful as it 
sounds because it isn't used in very many places any more.
