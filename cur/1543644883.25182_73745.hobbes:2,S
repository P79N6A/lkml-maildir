(It's actually Vectra XU 5/90, not 90/5 - now that I have physical access to
the box again. The google is full of horror stories about problems with this
particular model ;).
I tried SMP kernel, and it went a little further (no MCE) but it halted
after "Intel old style machine check architecture supported". For some odd
reason, linux says the box has 2 cpu's during boot, but it afaik only has
one.
The I forced mce_disabled to 1 in bluesmoke.c, and the SMP kernel booted.
During init, it oopsed, however.
I then compiled an UP kernel again, with mce_disabled=1 (same as "nomce" I
gather), and it booted.
The 3c509 appears not to work (but was found), scsi cdrom coughs badly but
it did boot :).
Thanks.
