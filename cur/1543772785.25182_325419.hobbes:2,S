I would suggest that "don't want to care about it" already led and could 
lead to more bugs similar to the bugs discovered due to RT 
enchancements. But the bottom line here is that these bugs are almost 
always bugs in SMP kernel as well about which each kernel developer have 
to worry about.

Do you hardly working on the kernel patched with RT patch in other 
configurations than PREEMPT_RT? But I'm working and can;t report any 
outstanding issues/degradation. These changes _are_ "transperent" due to 
preemtp modes configurability. So what do you have behind "can hardly be 
"transparent" simply by wrapping #ifdef CONFIG_X around it"?

configurability of the kernel gives you possibily to choose what you 
want in your custom case. Source code organization is a matter of 
whatever else (readability, complexity, separation of completely 
different functionality (but this is not this case), desire for 
community acceptance, etc) but not that determinism and best overall 
performance are conflicting goals. Why don;t you object against SMP 
though it definitly could conflict with goals of desktop kernel 
configurations?
