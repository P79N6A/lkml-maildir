I see no such thing in the RFC.  What I do see is that you're
allow to use the [IP address] notation.  It can't see where it
says that if that IP address is an IP address of the local host,
that it should accept it as the final destination.
I can perfectly imagine that the same hosts runs serveral MTAs,
on different IP addresses, and that both might have the same
username, but it's for a different person.
If an MTA doesn't listen to INADDR_ANY, why should it need to
know all addresses that might correspond to it?  That shouldn't
mean that if it does listen to INADDR_ANY, it should know them
all, but that could be something an MTA might want to do.
Like Andrey says, it needs to go to the same MTA.
If for some reason it was needed to use the IP address in the
destination, it's very likely that when it reaches the final
host, it will be a connection to that IP address.  Atleast, seen
from the connecting host.  If it's using NAT, maybe there should
be some option to tell it to accept that IP address as a final
destination too.
