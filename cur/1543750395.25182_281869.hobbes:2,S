Subject: [PATCH] add printing of udev version to scripts/ver_linux
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/29/160

Since udev is starting to be used a lot of places and I've seen people get 
asked about their udev version a few times on lkml I figured it was 
perhaps time that scripts/ver_linux reported this info so it would get 
into more bugreports by default.
This patch adds printing of udev version to scripts/ver_linux

I guess it would also make sense to also add a tiny bit of text about udev 
to Documentation/Changes if the above goes in - if so there's a possible 
patch to do that below.
