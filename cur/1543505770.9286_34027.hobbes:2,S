I'm working on porting linux to a device with no secondary storage, i.e. I
have only ram.  The kernel is running, but is very unstable.  I believe
this to be because of swapping issues; the errors are get look like the
following:
# ls /sbin
put_dirty_page: page already exists
swap_duplicate: entry fffbea00, nonexistent swap file
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
Out of memory for ls.
Killed
#
One of the solutions I've been considering is to rewrite bdflush and/or
kswapd so that they don't try to do any swapping out of dirty pages.  But
before I do, I wanted to see if anybody has done this before and could
point me in the right direction.  So if anybody has, I'd greatly
appreciate your help.  Thanks,
  Todd
