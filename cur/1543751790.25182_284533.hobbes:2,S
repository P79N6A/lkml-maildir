Actually, I saw this APIC error too (on i386, with "noapic"), but I
ignored it because, aside from that message, all of my interrupt
problems were gone and I had fully working swsusp for the first time in
recorded history.
I should see what happens if I recompile with APIC support. Hopefully
I'll be able to get to that today.
