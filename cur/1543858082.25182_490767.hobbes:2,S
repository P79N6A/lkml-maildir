you only need include/* for this in 2.6
you can't do this at all with 2.4 kernels, it needs the whole lot.
(in both cases the code and headers are needed so that your module can
use the data structures and compile in the kernel code you select to use
from inlines)

you can still do that. Just you're better off building them in one go;
can you give us a pointer to the source of this 2.4 module you have?
Maybe some of the mechanisms that you want this for are now very
outdated and obsoleted by easier functionality.
