I also have this notebook, and the APM bios is rather broken. You might try
downgrading your BIOS to A07 or so, that *could* help (it helped here).
ACPI doesn't work stably on that machine (not here, at least), and doesn't
seem to be desirable, as reading battery status freezes the machine for
0.2s ;)
