One question I have right now is:  How does the kernel treat time  
slewing?  Sometimes I might want to say: "The clock has continuous  
error and measures 24hours and 2 seconds for every 24 hours of real  
time", in which case the monotonic time should be slewed -2sec/ 
24hours.  On the other hand, I might also want to say: "The clock has  
fixed error and is 2 hours ahead cause some dummy messed up the  
time", so I'm going to fix this over the next 2 weeks by slewing  
backwards 1 hour per 7 days, in which case I do _not_ want the  
monotonic time to be affected (I'm passing 2 days, not 1 day and 22  
hours).  How does the kernel handle this?  I've never seen any good  
description of the NTP and time-control APIs; if there is one out  
there (that's not 42 pages of dry standard), I would love a link.
Cheers,
