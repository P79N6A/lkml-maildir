I'd try out Andrew's patch scripts if I were you. If you're making a patch to
the kernel, you'd best keep it in separate patches from the beginning, and
that's exactly what those scripts are very useful for.

So how do you think you would do a binary search within big patches, if it
would take you 10,000 man-hours to split up the patch? Disabling a lot of
small patches is easy, disabling a part of a big one takes a lot more work.

Oh, so you're saying that security fixes don't cause bugs? Great world you live

See above.
