I tried 2.6.6-rc3-mm2, and didn't see any difference:
# cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.6.6-rc3-mm2 (lmakhlis@levlinux) (gcc version 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5)) #3 SMP Tue May 25 14:04:28 EDT 2004
# ./thread_test &
[749]
# ls /proc/749/task
ls: /proc/749/task: No such file or directory
# ps axw
...
  749 tty1     Z      0:00 [thread_test <defunct>]
...
I have now tested it on Fedora Core 2 (2.6.5), SLES 9 Beta (2.6.5) and RHL 9 w/ 2.6.6-rc3-mm2, with identical results.  Could it have anything to do with which thread library the program is using?  Here's mine:
# ldd ./thread_test
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/tls/libpthread.so.0 (0x40028000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0x42000000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
# strace ./pthread_test
