ah ok, i was wondering about this.. i saw it in rui's setup [SCHED_FIFO with
high prio]. Doesn't seem to make a difference though on first sight. still
xruns plenty above 1ms. 
playback only or rmmod'ing the network adapter driver or using the dummy
soundcard driver instead of snd-cs46xx doesn't make a difference either.
after rmmoding the network card driver i saw:
sis900 0000:00:03.0: Device was removed without properly calling
pci_disable_device(). This may need fixing.
in m dmesg. rmmod'ing snd-cs46xx gives me:
Sound Fusion CS46xx 0000:00:0f.0: Device was removed without properly
calling pci_disable_device(). This may need fixing.
too, so maybe i have already hit a BUG in the kernel and this screwed up all
further test results.
Will build a kernel with debugging stuff to see what's up. I'll also build a
VP only version to see if i still get these pci_disable_device() messages
with a "more vanilla" kernel ;)
