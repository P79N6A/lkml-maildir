I would probably turn it into
	unsigned long *ebp = *((unsigned long **)t->esp);
	/* Bits 0,1 and 13..31 must be shared with the stack base */
	if (((unsigned long)ebp ^ (unsigned long)t) & ~(2*PAGE_SIZE-4))
		return 0;
	return *ebp;
Comments? Alternative variant: just let schedule() store its return address
in the task_struct. Yeah, it's couple of tacts per schedule(). And much saner
code, without second-guessing the compiler. OTOH, the value is used only
by Alt-SysRq-T, so... Hell knows.
