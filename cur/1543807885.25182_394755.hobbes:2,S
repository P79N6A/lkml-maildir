This is interesting, considering that e.g. IA64_SGI_SN2=y, NUMA=n or 
IA64_DIG=y, ACPI=n are currently allowed configurations.

This was what Keith wanted.
It seems everyone thinks I am wrong, but when I'm implementing what one 
person suggests, other people say that what I am doing is wrong.

1. NUMA on ia64 currently depends on !FLATMEM.
2. IA64_GENERIC currently select's NUMA.
3. You say IA64_GENERIC should not be tied with ARCH_FLATMEM_ENABLE.
It's impossible to fulfill all three of them.
My initial approach to fix them was to remove the select's from 
IA64_GENERIC, therefore removing 2., but this patch was not accepted.
This patch adds more select's to IA64_GENERIC, therefore removing 3., 
but you disagree with it.
The last choice it to remove the dependency of NUMA on !FLATMEM...  ;-)

Theoretically and maybe academically interesting, I should be able to 
build a kernel that boots on all non-NUMA platforms, currently, that is 
not possible.
