Note that the PPC processor bus can connect to multiple
"north bridges" (or other PPCs) at the same time.  It's
not a point-to-point bus.  It sounds like the AGP bridge
in question sits directly on the processor bus, in which 
case there would not necessarily be any equivalent to the
PCI configuration registers for the bridge itself.
Does anyone know offhand what part number this AGP bridge is or
who makes it?
