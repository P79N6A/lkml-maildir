Hi Pekka,
I think you're right. You are using read as a trick to print your headers
on trace_pipe.
Actually print_header should probably work on both trace and trace_pipe.
It needs to change the parameter passed to trace_header, probably turning
the seq_file into a trace_iterator to make it generic for both trace and trace_pipe,
and then let it catch headers in more than one shot because your headers are
probably too large for the seq buffer.
This change would solve the problem of a generic handler.
Concerning your free of allocation and lock, I guess two callbacks can
be added on struct tracer (unfortunately adding some complexity in it,
but if the optional annotation is added, it could go well):
_file_open and file_release
both adapted for seq files and pipes to signal the tracer that the file
is opened or released. You could put or release your allocated and private
datas on them and retrieve them in the trace_iterator on each callback.
It's just an opinion...

IMHO, perhaps the trace insertions of integrated tracers, and other particular tracers
things should be put in their own tracer files. That could indeed make more clear
the tracing core in trace.c
