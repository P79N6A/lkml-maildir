We will. Each page steal and each allocation will increase
the memory_pressure variable, and because of that, also the
inactive_target.
Whenever either 
- one zone gets low on free memory *OR* 
- all zones get more or less low on free+inactive_clean pages *OR*
- we get low on inactive pages (inactive_shortage > inactive_target/2),
THEN kswapd gets woken up immediately.
We do this both from the page allocation code and from
__find_page_nolock (which gets hit every time we reclaim
an inactive page back for its original purpose).

Currently we have none of this, but once 2.5 is forked
off, I'll submit a patch which shuffles all variables
into per-node (per pgdat) structures.
