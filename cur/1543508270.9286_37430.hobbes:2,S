we need a better time system for linux glibc
a double float value
struct {
    double count ;
    double clocks_per_sec ;
}
    so time  = count / clocks_per_sec
  64 bit float max = 2^64    / clockpersec = 5.2704 * 10^10 sec =
1675.855 years
128 bit float max = 2^128  / clockpersec = 9.7223 * 10^29 sec = 3.091407
* 10^22 years
a 128 bit float can be use for faster cpu's
for intel we can get this by useing the  32 bit counter (clocked at core
speed) inside the cpu
ge
a PII 350 Mhz
1 count = 1 / (350 * 10^6)  = 2.857142857 ....... ns
witch will rollover  every
    time  = count / cpu core clk   =  2^32 / (350 * 10^6) = 12.27133513
sec
when rollover is achieved it can interrupt witch will count the hi bits
(32 - 127) of the value
is someone all ready doing this
linux can be the beast computing tool lets make it so
