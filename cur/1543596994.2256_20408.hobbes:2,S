Nope. The same thing happens as before.
A couple of debugging statements show that ksoftirqd_CPU0 gets created
fine, and that ksoftirqd_task(0) is indeed getting set correctly
before we loop in spawn_ksoftirqd().
After this the second call to kernel_thread() succeeds, but
ksoftirqd() itself never gets called before the hang occurs.
Cheers,
