It is starting now. Basically the corporations with the masses of
software patents and patent lawyers are probably waiting for the
settling of the discussion and the ratification of the relevant
to-be-accepted laws. And the war is not over yet ...

illegally). Up to now it was a question of whether you can succeed in
court with them and which courts to go ....
