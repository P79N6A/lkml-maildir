I've never used BK (not allowed to), but some things I've read about it
sound quite annoying.  For instance:
 * Every source tree contains your entire repository => massive disk usage
 * Must "unlock" files before working on them ("bk edit"); I recall
   doing this with RCS, and it was, well, a real pain.
