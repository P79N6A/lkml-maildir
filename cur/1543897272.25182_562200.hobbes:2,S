I have heard that applied to cryptography.  In almost every case someone 
has thought of it already and there is a good reason it is not used.
Don't think that it is new and novel until you have done a whole lot of 
research in the field.  There is a reason that the Greeks considered 
Hubris a sin against the Gods...
As for "defensive patents", I think of them as a time bomb waiting to 
happen.
The company that files a defensive patent is rarely the problem, it is 
when they go broke and someone with less ethics buys them up.  The second 
company does not feel bound by those previous agreements and tries to 
squeeze all the money they can out of the purchaced patent pool.
It may seem like a good idea now, but it comes back to haunt the rest of 
us later on down the road.
