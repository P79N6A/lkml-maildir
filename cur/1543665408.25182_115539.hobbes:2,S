Just use blk_register_region() to claim the region you want, you
don't have to care for any major/minor binary.  There is not much of
the dev_t space used for block devices at all so there's no problem.
Actually coordinating those allocations with LANANA might help to not
step other people on their feet, but your return value will tell that
anyway.
