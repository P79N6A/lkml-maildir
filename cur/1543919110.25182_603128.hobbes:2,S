That's not a valid argument. This may work with a WM5 device, but looks
very dubious, wrt. other RNDIS devices. Why are these constants
hardcoded and not taken in some way from the descriptors?
There must be some justification why these values need to be hardcoded,
and if so, this must be dependent on the rndis device really being a WM5
device.
