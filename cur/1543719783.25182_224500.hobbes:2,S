Correct.  My tool already detects recursions and prints warning, it
just cannot make out the harmful ones and gives a warning for each.

That's what I basically want, at least for trivial recursions with
only one function involved.
For a->b->c->a type recursions, I also need to identify all involved
functions in the correct order, that's where my ugly format comes
from.
RECURSION:	2
STEP:	a
STEP:	b
STEP:	c
This mean that the recursion from a to b to c and back can happen
twice at most.
Sure, the format is ugly.  If anyone really cares I can change it into
any other.  But it gets the job done, so I don't care.

"Interesting" is the wrong word, really.  Imo it doesn't make any
sense to write such code and therefore I don't want to deal with it
either.  Print a warning and be done with it.  See my output:
WARNING: multiple recursions around check_sig()
