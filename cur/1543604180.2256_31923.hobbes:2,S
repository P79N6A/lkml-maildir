Already done.  When vmlinux is converted to [b]Zimage kbuild runs
  objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .comment -S
The comments are stripped out at that stage.  Before you start fiddling
with vmlinux.lds, try this:
  objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .comment -S vmlinux vmlinux.stripped
Look at vmlinux.stripped, it is what actually gets loaded.  If there
are any offending strings from gcc then we can look at them but I
really doubt that there are any.
