Kernel 2.3.29, egcs 1.1.2, glibc 2.1.2
If initrd is specified, then compilation fails with:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.3.29/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce
-DCPU=686 -march=i686  -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
init/main.c: In function start_kernel':
init/main.c:489: memory_start' undeclared (first use in this function)
init/main.c:489: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
init/main.c:489: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1
This appears to be a result of an incomplete migration of memory-related
declaration into include/linux/bootmem.h; adding:
static unsigned long memory_start = 0;
static unsigned long memory_end = 0;
to that file allows compiling.
