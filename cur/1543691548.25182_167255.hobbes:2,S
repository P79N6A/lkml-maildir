Larry didn't show anything related to whether closed source is bad or not,
he simply tried to explain that someone has to PAY to host all those gateways
and that since HE actually pays for them, he at least expects not to be the
subject of permanent complaints, or he will finally stop paying for those. If
you have the lines, the machine and the time to do this yourself, perhaps you
could propose Larry to do it yourself then complain about his closed source
software which you're not forced to use.
Now please, please... before RMS jumps into the wagon again, stop using every
mail which contains the two letters B and K as the pretext to start a new war.
Thanks,
Willy
