The 24 bit color now fails using Xorg 6.8.1 and the released 2.6.9 kernel.
The video drivers involved werer i810 (and intel_agp).  This was tried on
two different systems with the same results (separate kernel compiles too).
Note, the screen resolution setting doesn't seem to effect the problem.
These systems were running 2.6.8.1 at 24 bit color with no problems.
The error messages in the Xorg.0.log varies, however on one system received:
    space: 63692 wanted 65528
On the other the problem was an X lockup upon ICEWM menu selection, no log entry.
Anyone have an idea how to proceed?
