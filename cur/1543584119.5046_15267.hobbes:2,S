Subject: [PATCH] remove CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL_CB from Configure.help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

It appears that use of CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL_CB was removed in
2.4.2-ac12.  The two files affected were Config.in  and the Makefile 
in drivers/char/pcmcia.  
If in fact this option is now history, the reference in Configure.help should also 
be history.  I noticed this when the number of Configure.help "orphans" increased
from 40 to 41 recently.
Here is the patch to do this, against 2.4.2-ac14.
