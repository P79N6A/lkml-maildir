Thanks for the pointer.
I'm confused: patch-2.6.16-rt29-tglx3 is dated 2006-09-07, yet there
have been numerous revisions of the -rt patch set since then. Does that
mean that no serious bugs have been found since September? Do the -rt
patch sets for 2.6.17 - 2.6.20 only bring new features and/or adapt the
-rt infrastructure to the newer kernels?

Ouch :-)
I think I'll try my luck with 2.6.20 (it's been working so far).
By the way, I have a question: when I compile glibc for this system,
should I compile it against the vanilla 2.6.20 includes, or against the
patched 2.6.20-rt includes?
Regards.
