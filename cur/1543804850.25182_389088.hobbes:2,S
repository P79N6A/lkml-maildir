I forgot that I'd also made changes to the "CPU hog" component of the 
interactive response as the one I had was useless on heavily loaded 
systems.  It appears that I made a mistake (I used interactive 
sleepiness instead of ordinary sleepiness for detecting CPU hogs) during 
these changes which means that tasks that do no interactive sleeping 
(such as your dd) get classified as CPU hogs.  The transcode task 
escapes this because, although its sleeps aren't really interactive, 
they're classified as such.  More widespread us of TASK_NONINTERACTIVE 
would fix this but would need to be done carefully as it would risk 
breaking the normal scheduler.
However, in spite of the above, the fairness mechanism should have been 
able to generate enough bonus points to get dd's priority back to less 
than 34.  I'm still investigating why this didn't happen.
