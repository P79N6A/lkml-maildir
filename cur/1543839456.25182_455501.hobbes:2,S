Subject: Open ext3 bugs in the kernel Bugzilla

Now that many people seem to enjoy the fun of creating an ext4 with many 
new features, it seems to be a good time for finding people who'd like 
to review the 16 open ext3 bugs in the kernel Bugzilla [1] before the 
code bases of ext3 and ext4 start diverging.  ;-)
Any volunteers?

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
