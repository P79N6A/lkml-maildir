Hmmm does not apply here :

However, it applies to plain 2.6.16 with sched_[1-6] applied (but with fuzz).
Parts of the patches are already applied by your previous patches (eg: chunk1).
I suspect that you accidentely rediffed sched.c against an intermediate
working tree instead.
For instance, this part is already provided by patch 4 :
@@ -77,6 +77,21 @@
 #define NS_TO_JIFFIES(TIME)    ((TIME) / (1000000000 / HZ))
 #define JIFFIES_TO_NS(TIME)    ((TIME) * (1000000000 / HZ))
 
+#if (BITS_PER_LONG < 64)
+#define JIFFIES_TO_NS64(TIME) \
 .../...
And this part overlaps with a previous chunk in patch 7 :
-                       rq->expired_timestamp = jiffies;
-               if (!TASK_INTERACTIVE(p) || EXPIRED_STARVING(rq)) {
+                       rq->expired_timestamp = now;
+               if (!TASK_INTERACTIVE(p) || expired_starving(rq)) {
