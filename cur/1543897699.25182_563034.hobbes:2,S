  yes, that would definitely be the case if I were doing a DMA read but in this
case I'm doing a DMA write.  I could force the kernel to instantiate zero'ed
pages for the entire range but that would significantly impact performance.

  Hhrrrmmm, I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here.  In our case the
user application just does a write() on a socket.  Our driver is doing a DMA
directly from user pages out to the interface.  We have fallback timeout code
if the DMA takes longer than a certain length of time where we mark the pages
that haven't yet been transfered as COW so we can return early to the user
application without violating Linux write() semantics.  It sounds like you're
advocating major changes to the application which wouldn't be useful.  My
appologies if I'm misinterpreting your comment.
