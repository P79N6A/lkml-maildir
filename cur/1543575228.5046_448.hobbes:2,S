I see we have a new "call_usermodehelper" routine now.  It looks like the
end result is similer to exec_usermodehelper, except that you no longer
need to mess with creating kernel threads yourself.
Is call_usermodehelper now the officially blessed way for kernel code to
run something in user space?  Perhaps exec_usermodehelper should become
private to kmod.c?
I also see that call_usermodehelper will call do_exit() if the exec fails,
while the path taken in request_module does not do that.  Can both be
right? 
Thanks,
jon
