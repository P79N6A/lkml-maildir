Here it boots and works, but I can't say that I have done any serious
testing. The following message appears in the kernel log:
Dec 25 11:38:09 lfs parport_pc: Ignoring new-style parameters in presence of
obsolete ones
Dec 25 11:38:09 lfs parport_pc: VIA 686A/8231 detected
Dec 25 11:38:09 lfs parport_pc: probing current configuration
Dec 25 11:38:09 lfs parport_pc: Current parallel port base: 0x378
Dec 25 11:38:09 lfs parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7, using FIFO
[PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP]
Dec 25 11:38:09 lfs parport_pc: VIA parallel port: io=0x378, irq=7
I don't understand the first line, and it wasn't there in 2.6.9. Could you
please explain what it means? I don't pass any parameters to the module. I
use module-init-tools version 3.0 although I know it is not the latest.
Relevant .config portion:
#
# Parallel port support
#
CONFIG_PARPORT=m
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=m
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_CML1=m
# CONFIG_PARPORT_SERIAL is not set
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO=y
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO=y
# CONFIG_PARPORT_OTHER is not set
CONFIG_PARPORT_1284=y
