Hello, all.
I am writing a pseudo-realtime control system, based on kernel 2.2.14.
The only RT-like task needs to hang off the timer IRQ.  I am using
techniques like those in the book "Linux Kernel Internals", by Beck, et
al..
The patches in that book won't apply (they are for 2.1.24 or lower),
plus I want a somewaht different functionality, which brings me to my
question:  How can I get (modversions-enabled) functions exported from
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c?
I see in /proc/ksyms that there are some functions exported from there
({enable,disable}_irq, probe_irq_{on,off}, etc.), and they have correct
looking versions.
When I add my new finctions to i386ksyms.c:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(grab_timer_interrupt);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(release_timer_interrupt);
I get names like
grab_timer_interrupt_R__ver_grab_timer_interrupt
release_timer_interrupt_R__ver_release_timer_interrupt
instead of
local_irq_count_R4d40375f
Additionally, when I make a dummy module (a la Alessandro Rubini's
"Hello" module in "Linux Device Drivers"), I get the following warning:
control.c:31: warning: implicit declaration of function
`printk_R1b7d4074'
The module seems to work (it printk's "module loaded" on load and
"module unloaded" on unload), but I suspect that this is because I am
printk()-ing unformatted text strings - only one parameter gets sent.
So, I obviously have missed some basics about:
a) versioning,
b) exporting symbols, and
c) modules.
could soemone please enlighten me, or direct me along the path of
enlightenment :)
Thanks
- Steve
