John,
There is a problem in the way this code handles the conversion to usec. 
  There is a conversion here and also in the get_offset code.  If the 
nanoseconds are carrier until after the addition of the two about 25% of 
the time you will end up with an additional usec in time.  I strongly 
suggest changing to convert to usec after the addition of xtime and 
get_offset time to avoid this.  If the "correct" thing is done in 
clock_gettime() (i.e. get_offset is in nanoseconds) this actually turns 
up as a back step in time WRT gettimeofday and clock_gettime().
