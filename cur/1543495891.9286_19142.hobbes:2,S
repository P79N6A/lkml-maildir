	Indeed, no, not via POP3, but software used at VGER for the MTA
	functions did handle pipe driven programs the same way as "message
	store files" (e.g. UNIX mailbox).
	My opinnion about considering "X-UIDL:" as a sign of spam is that
	the idea is misguided.   All in all, an evolutionary view at the
	spammers can show that for every *simple* countermeasure we use
	against some simple signature characteristics, the spammers will
	adapt fairly quickly.   The only truly effective way to block the
	spammers is to have message content analysing system which does
	recognize spams out of non-spams.
	For interesting reading on the topic, see RFC 2505 
	( I get it from:  
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/rfc/rfc2505.txt
