Confused.  Does the above refer to the difference between this patch and
the previous version, or does it just describe this patch?  Hopefully the
latter, because the former isn't interesting, long-term.
If is _is_ a full standalone description of this patch then it's a bit hard
to follow ;)

Shouldn't these be runtime options (ie: module parameters)?
