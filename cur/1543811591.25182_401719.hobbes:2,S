Subject: [PATCH 1/4] change buffer_head.b_size to size_t
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/27/282

Increase the size of the buffer_head b_size field (only) for
64 bit platforms.  Update some old and moldy comments in and
around the structure as well.
The b_size increase allows us to perform larger mappings and
allocations for large I/O requests from userspace, which tie
in with other changes allowing the get_block_t() interface to
map multiple blocks at once.

+ * for backward compatibility reasons (e.g. submit_bh).
