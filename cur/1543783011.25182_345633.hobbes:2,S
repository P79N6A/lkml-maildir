And please test your patches before submitting them.
As a minimum compile test any code you change and any code impacted by your
changes.
Also boot a kernel with the changes applied to make sure nothing blows up at
runtime.
And if possible (if you have the hardware), test that the drivers still work
properly. If you don't have hardware to test with then you can at least still
try loading the drivers and see if they fail in a sane manner (no hardware 
detected) or if they blow up.
When submitting a patch, please always provide a description of what change 
the patch makes and why it makes sense to make that change. Also tell what 
level of testing the patch has seen - and remember to Cc: maintainers/authors
of the code you change in addition to sending to the list.
And patches are generally preffered inline as opposed to attachments, as 
should be clear from the documents I pointed you at yesterday.
