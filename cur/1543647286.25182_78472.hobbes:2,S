Subject: [PATCH] IPMI driver for Linux, version 5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have put a new version of the IPMI driver on my home page 
(
http://home.attbi.com/~minyard
) that removes the Linus-incompatable 
typedefs.  The only typedefs left are "handle" ones.

PS - In case you don't know, IPMI is a standard for system management, 
it provides ways to detect the managed devices in the system and sensors 
attached to them.  You can get more information at
