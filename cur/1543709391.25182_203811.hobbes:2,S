Well, that would probably not even link on kernel without ACPI...
We could make that functionality depend on CONFIG_ACPI, and allow
runtime selection only if its defined... But those two drivers are
pretty different just now and acpi-dependend chunk is pretty big. (It
does funny stuff like polling for AC plug removal if we are in
high-power state  and battery would not handle that. Old driver simply
refused to use high-power states on such machines.)
