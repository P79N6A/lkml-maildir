Subject: [CFT] rename patch + FAT stuff

	Folks, new versions of rename and FAT patches are out there.
News in rename patch:
	* UMSDOS cleanup; now rename on UMSDOS should work correctly
	  (yeah, right...).
News in FAT patch:
	* same changes to UMSDOS as in the rename patch, but they are
	  *NOT* enough to make it work with new msdosfs. It's still alpha
	  and dangerous. You've been warned.
	Patches are agains 2.2.5. Please, help with testing rename patch.
Things to watch for: renaming files and directories on UMSDOS, creating
of the first (OK, second, indeed) hardlink to files there. Otherwise it's
the same as the previous version.
	Status of rename patch: VFS part - final, modulo remaining special
handling of NCPFS and NFS. Filesystems except aforementioned two and
UMSDOS - final. Unless something bad will be found I'm going to submit it
for 2.2.6. If UMSDOS fixes (in rename patch) will work OK they'll go there
too. For 2.2.7+ - NFS stuff, NCPFS (Petr, maybe you'll submit your patch
for testing now?) and new FAT + final UMSDOS cleanup (2.2.8+). Anyway, all
interface changes are in the rename patch right now, so dealing with odd
filesystems will not affect the rest.
	Status of FAT patch - didn't change; still deep alpha.
