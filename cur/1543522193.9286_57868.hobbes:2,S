	This is rather ammusing, as the system that delivers mail from
	vger to *.com *.org and *.edu is hosted at above.net.  I too
	think that ORBS and most of the other black list solutions are
	evil, but are they more or less evil than spam?  It's just like
	last year's black list argument on l-k about blocking dialup
	pools, is the inconvenience worth it?  I for one think it is.
