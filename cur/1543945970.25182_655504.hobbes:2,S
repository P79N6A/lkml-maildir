Subject: [PATCH 4/5] signal(ia64): add a signal stack overflow check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/18/127

The similar check has been added to x86_32(i386) in commit
id 83bd01024b1fdfc41d9b758e5669e80fca72df66.
So we add this check to ia64 and improve it a liitle bit in that
we need to check for stack overflow only when the signal is on stack.
