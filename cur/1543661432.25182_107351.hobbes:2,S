It strikes me that we can make use of the bus matching logic for this. 
For ISA, since we have no concept of a card id, we could instead match
on when the binding should occur (i.e. ISA_BIND_EARLY and
ISA_BIND_LATE).  Thus each driver picks its binding type and we run bind
early before all other busses and bind late after them (probably by
simulating a hotplug event that says hey I suddenly found a bunch of ISA
cards of type ISA_BIND_LATE).  It's a bit of an abuse of what bus
matching is supposed to do, but it should work for the purpose
