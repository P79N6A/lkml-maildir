﻿xtime_nsec underflows after ﻿clocksource_adjust. Before ﻿clocksource_adjust,
﻿xtime_nsec is a small positive.
When ﻿﻿xtime_nsec underflows at the first time, xtime.tv_nsec becomes -1.
Later on when the second tick arrives, below statement in the while loop
 clock->xtime_nsec += clock->xtime_interval;
will cause ﻿clock->xtime_nsec becomes positive again. So the second tick
appears a going-backward time.

The testing uses vsyscall to get call gettimeofday. vsyscall_gtod_data.wall_time_nsec
is a u32 while timespec->tv_nsec is a signed long.

We just triggered it on 2 machines. Other machines are ok.
