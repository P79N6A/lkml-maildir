Let me do some surgery :)
Interrupt setup is a bit tricky on the VAXen. First, they actually have
separated RX and TX IRQ and these aren't static. IRQ probing needs to be
redone (at least can't be easily copied) since the new dz_init() is
basically a complete new rewrite...

Old ./drivers/char/dz.c + VAX changes + SERIO changes, that is :)  I
guess best practice is that VAX people first merge up with MIPS folks,
then we snatch the old driver together and have a beer...
