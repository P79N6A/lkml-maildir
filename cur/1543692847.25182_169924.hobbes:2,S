hmm, okay I see it now clearly, we should take
the approach which was so successful for scsi ...
echo "vserver add-new-vserver 100 0 1 192 0 0 1" >/proc/1/attr/new
and of course to 'change' the context, a simple
echo "vserver change-to-old-context 100" >/proc/self/attr/migrate
(and it was never seen again, because it vanished in context 100)
will be sufficient ...
seriously I am completely on your side if we talk about
limiting a process or changing it's environment, even
if we talk about setting a class assignment, but I just 
don't believe it's the perfect solution for everything ...
best,
Herbert
