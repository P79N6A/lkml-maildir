No oopses on my dual pentium pure 2.2.1.  Kernel was compiled with
unix98 ptys but I guess they are not used by this program anyway.  Run
with parameter "200", load average jumps to 202 and the machine is
sloooow but responding.  There are many warnings "dev (03:00)
tty->count(0) != #fd's(1) in do_tty_hangup" and a couple of "null TTY
for (03:01) in tty_fasync" but no oops in 20 minutes run.
