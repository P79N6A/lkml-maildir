It should not be in the boot image, or at least it should be usable
elsewhere, because it isn't used at boot. It is only used in a running
system (not necessarily booted from the kernel in question, but running as
opposed to needed by lilo/grub).

But that tight coupling has a cost, and the reason for compressed kernel
is to make it small to fit {places}, which is one of the benefits of
modules. Putting it in the kernel or nowhere is not optimal, most people
can manage to find documentation which isn't bound that tightly. If it's
available as a module it's useful in all the ways people currently use
things they may or may not want in the kernel, even if "in the kernel"
only means "stuck to the boot image."
