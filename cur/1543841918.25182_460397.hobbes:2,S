The driver should get merged as a single commit anyway, even
if split diffs are posted for review. Even if it gets merged
like this, bisect will work since the Kconfig option is added
in the final patch.

does it matter? int as a counter is pretty standard.

In one of the previous reviews, we told them to do it this way
instead. Initializing at declaration is error-prone.

I'd argue to keep them ;-)

the lowest-level hypercall should return H_* by convention.
Then again, it should also be called plpar_modify_ehea_port()
in that case.

it's a gray area. In general, I recommend not to combine them
at all. Initialization to NULL or 0 is always bad, this one
is harmless, but I'd still leave it this way, especially after
telling them to clean this up earlier ;-)
