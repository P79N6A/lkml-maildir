NetWare used 16K stacks in kernel by default. 4K is not enough room. I 
have to dance around a lot of issues with 4K stacks. I haven't followed
who came up with the idea to limit stacks to 4K, but they should have 
the option of 4-16K. NeWare 5.0 started using 32 Stacks for
all the compression support and FS crap, but 16K was a good number.
Why does the kernel need to be limited to 4K? for kernel preemption?
Someone needs to fix this. It's busted. It makes porting code between 
Windows and Linux and other OS's difficult to support.
