Subject: [2.5] Local printer not supported in 2.5?

I still can't print from any 2.5 kernel. I have the printer driver loaded, 
using:
  alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc
in the /etc/modprobe.conf (generated with 0.9.9pre).
Modules loaded:
  Module                  Size  Used by
  eepro100               20076  - 
  mii                     4064  - 
  parport_pc             21992  - 
  parport                35520  - 
There are no parport messages in dmesg, but when I did the first build I 
missed modules_install and it complained that I had the wrong (with 
preempt) modules. This persist with every kernel tried on this machine, 
from 2.5.50 forward.
Booting with 2.4.18 redhat or 2.4.20 kernel.org both work just fine and 
can use the printer.
From config:
  # Parallel port support
  CONFIG_PARPORT=m
  CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=m
  CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_CML1=m
  # CONFIG_PARPORT_SERIAL is not set
  CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO=y
  CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO=y
  # CONFIG_PARPORT_OTHER is not set
  CONFIG_PARPORT_1284=y
dmesg reports:
  pnp: the driver 'parport_pc' has been registered
  pnp: match found with the PnP device '00:12' and the driver 'parport_pc'
What have I missed?
