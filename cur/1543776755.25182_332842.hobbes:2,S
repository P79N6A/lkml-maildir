Subject: problem about Kconfig default value

hello list,
i had a problem about the default value in Kconfig.
for example,i had two Kconfig files:
arch/arm/mach-xxx/Kconfig
    ...
    config CPU_MHZ
    ...
init/Kconfig
    ...
    config PRESET_LPJ
    default 2 if(ARCH_XXX && CPU_MZH)
    default 1 if(ARCH_XXX && !CPU_MZH)
    ...
right after a "make mrproper" it worked just fine in "make menuconfig", 
but then i quit and "make menuconfig" again, the PRESET_LPJ did not
seem to change again while i disable/enabled CPU_MHZ.
is this presumed? or a bug?
thank you very much.
