make is your friend: it will only recompile those files that changed from
the last compilation. If you modify some #includes in the code, I believe
you will have to also run "make dep" before, to get dependencies right.
Another approach would be to compile the kernel on another different
machine, should you have one more powerful that the one you expect to try
the kernel on.
