I still think that patch is bad. I should have screamed when
CONFIG_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND went into kernel. That beast should
_not_ be configurable, it should just do the right thing.
But I realized that too late. And this only makes it works, making
that mistake part of user-kernel interface.
Sorry for not screaming when CONFIG_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND went in,
but please lets solve this correctly....
Like every console says if it needs to  be disabled during suspend,
and if at least one active console says so, we disable. Nothing to
configure, we just do the right thing. And it should not be that much
work, either.
