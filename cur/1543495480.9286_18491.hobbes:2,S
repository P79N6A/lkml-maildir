    This patch for Linux 2.2.7 contains some bug fixes:
    ...
    - The uid of the user who mounted the fs is now visible in /proc/mounts (last
      number).
    ...
I have not looked at the code, but I have one concern:
Maybe it is a bad idea to change the format of /proc/mounts.
It is not only information to look at - some people make
/etc/mtab a symlink to /proc/mounts, which means that various
programs will try to parse this file, and fail if the format
changes and the program is badly written.
Maybe there are no such badly written programs around,
but just to be sure, and also for future expansion, I think
that it would be better to not have a separate field but use
the option string instead, say, appending
	,mountuseruid=uid
to it (maybe only when uid is nonzero, so that in most cases
nothing changes).
