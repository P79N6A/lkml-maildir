I'm getting a bug print (really a warning) from enable_irq spawned from
the e100 driver. The reason is that enable_irq is being called because
the irq depth is zero.
Looking into this, it is because the e100 uses a shared interrupt.  On
setup (see drivers/net/e100.c: e100_up) it disables the irq that it will
use, and then calls request_irq which calls setup_irq which zeros out
the depth of the irq if it is not shared.  So if the e100 is the first
to be loaded, then you get this message. 
I know that for now this doesn't hurt anything, but besides annoying me
in my print outs (I can't stop panicking when I see it ;-),  is this
really a bug and thus a design flaw of the e100? How else can a shared
irq initialize without turning off the irq before setting itself up?
Should it enable the irq before it requests it, and thus open the race
of a spurious interrupt, or just disable all interrupts?
Thanks,
