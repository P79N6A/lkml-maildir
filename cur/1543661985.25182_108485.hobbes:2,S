Well as a rule you would gain efficiency the larger your request size gets.
There will be a point where you make the trade off. And no, anticipatory
scheduling will not make read request sizes bigger.

In the presence of other IO, anticipatory scheduling would help here. In the
absense of other IO, readahead would not help (past the efficiency problem
above). However anticipatory scheduling _would_ mean you don't need as much
RAM tied up doing nothing (or being discarded) for one minute before it
is needed.

File readahead would not help. Anticipatory scheduling can.

It avoids seeks mainly, but the lesser need for readahead should mean
the readahead algorithm doesn't need to be very smart.

Well I don't see it so much as readahead vs anticipatory scheduling.
I know readahead is important.
