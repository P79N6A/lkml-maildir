Subject: [BUG 2.4.6] PPID of a process is set to itself

Hi,
When I am playing with clone system call, I found the case the cloned process
becomes the zombie which is not reaped because the PPID of the process is
set to itself. The test program are following.
#include <sched.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int	stack[2048];
int
func(void *p)
{
	exit(0);
}
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	clone(func, &stack[2048],
		CLONE_VM|CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES|CLONE_SIGHAND|CLONE_THREAD,
		NULL);
	sleep(1);
	exit(0);
}
Following patch fixes the bug, but I don't know this is correct. Can
someone please explain me why in forget_original_parent(), the parent of
processes in a thread group is set to another process in the thread
group?
