hi, Steve:
    Thanks, your words make this more sense. :)
    The global process I understand is follow:
add_wait_queue(q, wait);
/*
 *   service handler is waking up current task now, it so soon!
 *   And the try_to_wake_up() will change task_struct->state to 
TASK_RUNNING.
 */
set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE); /* reset task_struct->state 
from TASK_RUNNING to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE. */
if (!some_event) /* alreay wakeup, so some_event is true */
        schedule();
/*
 *   preempt_schedule() is taking here!
 *   current task will sleep forever without PREEMPT_ACTIVE check! 
because of it is removed
 *   from runqueue, and none will wakeup it (bring it back to runqueue).
 */
set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
remove_wait_queue(q, wait);
In fact, your first reply already is very clearly, but I read too 
quickly to ignore something.
These code of only six lines imply so many secrets. All interesting came 
from it.
Happy everyday.
