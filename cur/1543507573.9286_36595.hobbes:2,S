Dear kernel developers,
This is my first ever posting to linux-kernel.
Thankyou to all for the excellent work you have done, and are doing. 
Computing is fun again, thanks to Linux.
Since installing Kernel 2.2.9 I have experienced 2 power failures, each
causing system reboot.
Following reboot and automatic e2fsck, a file, of size zero, has
appeared in the directory I was working in at the time of the power
failure.  No files were missing, and no corruption of the legitimate
files was evident.
The name of the file, on the most recent occasion, was "next"; it was
something like "arraylist", or "listelement" prior to that.
