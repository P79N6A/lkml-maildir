Can you put a nicer Subject: message, rather than giving all three patches 
the same Subject.
I'm assuming this will all go through Andrew anyway, but at least my tools 
(and I assume Andrew's too) will take the Subject: line and make it into 
the short description. So if you give a nondescriptive subject line, the 
short description will be bad too.
So please make the subject line really be about that *particular* patch.
