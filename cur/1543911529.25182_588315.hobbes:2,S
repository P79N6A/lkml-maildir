Yeah, that would make more sense, if that is what is needed.
Can someone with a iphone test this out?  If you look at how the
berry_charge driver does it, the set_config stuff happens after the
magic command.  As I don't have an iphone, nor have I ever seen any
dumps of the command streams, I don't really know if the set_config
message really is necessary or not.
