Rik,
I just tried to boot 2.4.17+rmap12 turning off HIGHMEM and it booted just
fine.
So it has to do with some HIGHMEM change happend between  rmap11c and
rmap12.
Does this help ?
Thanks,
Badari

At this point we're not even near using pagetables yet,
so I guess this is something else ...
(I'm not 100% sure, though)
