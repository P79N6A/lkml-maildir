I got something similar.  I would predict that you are using devfs.
The problem is that devfs doesn't set inode->i_mapping->a_ops for a
block device.  Ext2 (for instance) calls init_special_inode, and pre11
added a line to that procedure to initialize that field.  But devfs
doesn't use init_special_inode.
The patch below fixes the problem for me.  It may be that devfs should
be calling init_special_inode instead, but that sets inode->i_fop as
well and it looks like devfs sets that a bit differently.  Richard?
Paul.
