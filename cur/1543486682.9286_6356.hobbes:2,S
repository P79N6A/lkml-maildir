Unfortunately things are not so simple.
Just today (or yesterday) I finished a little program
(available on request) that looks at BIOS disks and at Linux disks
and tries to find out which BIOS disks correspond to which Linux ones.
For example, I have machines where the second disk (BIOS 0x81)
is /dev/sdb, /dev/sda, /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc (respectively).
Thus, a setup cannot reasonably be expected to guess
which disk is the second BIOS disk, and which disk
will be booted.
