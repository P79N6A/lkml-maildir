Yes, in theory ;-)
I have an internal IDE 100MB Zip @home.
In the office I have a 250MB USB ZIP.
The media is partitioned, with the 4th primary partition formatted
as VFAT.
On the IDE I mount /dev/hdb, on the USB thing I mount sd[ab]4
depending if the flash reader is there or not.
Hmh?
# fdisk -l /dev/sdb
Disk /dev/sdb: 4 heads, 32 sectors, 1536 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 128 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb4             1      1536     98288    6  FAT16
Of course I use different kernels, @home: 2.4.9ac18 and 2.4.1[34]-xfs;
@office for now 2.4.9ac3+bcl.
Until now I thought it had something to do with the different gendisk,
LDM or so.
