Now its down to about 80, and the display for cache and buffers has 
shrunk considerably.  Normal after boot memory usage is in the 125 
meg area, and that portion of the display is now around 350 megs, 
having grown 100megs or so overnight.

Those two colors in the ksysguard report window are getting mighty 
thin.

The srcs for xosview?  I did a freshmeat search, and what I found 
hadn't been touched in over a year.  I didn't bother grabbing it as 
it was the same version number as the copy I have.

But in the various memory related things in /proc, I don't see a 
reference to anonymous?
