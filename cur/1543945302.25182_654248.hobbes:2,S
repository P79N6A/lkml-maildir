Lukas Hejtmanek,
I have to say, that I've heard this subject before, the summary answer 
seems to be, that the kernel can not guess the wishes of the user 100% 
of the time.  If you have a low priority I/O task use ionice(1) to set 
the priority of that task so it doesn't nuke your high priority task.
I have to personal stake in this answer but I can report that for my 
high I/O tasks it does work like a charm.
