Frank McIngvale was overheard saying:
: I was having the same problem. The PPP link would just stall after a while
: and never come back. The link was up, and tcpdump showed a lot of ACK's
: going out, but nothing coming in. On a whim, I turned off DMA on my IDE
: hard drive, and the stalls have not come back (yet). But, I may just be 
: having a run of good luck.
Those are pretty much the same symptoms I was having.  Most of the time my link
would come back up, though, but it took a while.  I'll try out the dma setting
- how did you turn it off, hdparm?
