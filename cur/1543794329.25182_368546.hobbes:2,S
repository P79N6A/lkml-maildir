Hi Eric,
Initially we had written the patch without disable_local_APIC and
disable_IO_APIC only. But realized later that fix provided by you to
move apic initialization in init_IRQ has not been merged yet.
Like i386, here also this is a stop gap solution only till your patch is
merged. After that we shall drop this code.
I understand that it is less reliable but at least it provides us a base
to move forward and test kdump on x86_64 and address the other issues.
Thanks
Vivek
