Funny, I was doing the same thing....
I ran into the same problem and give up trying to make the
preemption functions inline.
The problem is that the structure task is not defined at the
point you declare your function. Defining them after the
declaration of task struct doesn't work either because some
header files need the spinlock definition very early (chicken and
eggs problem).
Note that I'm more or less done making the system preemptable
(I modified the interrupt path for i386 platform and the locking
stubs), but I also gave up trying to make it work on 2.4.XXX because
the SMP locking is not stable yet. Try to compile the kernel in UP with
the locking in debug mode and you'll see.
