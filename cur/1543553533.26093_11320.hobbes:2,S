Since f_pos of struct file is a loff_t, on 32-bit architectures it
needs a lock to make accesses atomic (or some more sophisticated form
of protection).  But looking in 2.4.0-test10, there doesn't seem to be
any such lock.
The llseek op is called with the Big Kernel Lock, but unlike in 2.2,
the read and write ops are called without any locks held, and so
generic_file_{read|write} make unprotected accesses to f_pos (through
their ppos argument).
Is this something for Ted's todo list?
