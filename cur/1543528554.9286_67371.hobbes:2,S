I know this is of-topic, but I read that cache-line ping-pong is a
problem for our spinlocks. Has anyone tried to move the spinlocks (*)
into a special page, and mark that page as "write-trough"?
It should be possible to add a new ELF section, and mark the global
spinlocks with __spinlockdata [like __initdata].
(*) I know that many spinlocks are located within other structures, but
some (important) spinlocks are not:
* kernel_flag
* tasklist_lock
* runqueue_lock
* global_bh_lock
* pagecache_lock
* pagemap_lru_lock
* inode_lock
* lru_list_lock
* hash_table_lock
* console_lock
* kmap_lock
* semaphore_lock [i386]
* tlbstate_lock [i386]
