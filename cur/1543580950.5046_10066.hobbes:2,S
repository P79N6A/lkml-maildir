That will need to be fixed with a handler anyways, the network stack requires 
unaligned accesses. If the IA64 port doesn't handle that it it's buggy and 
trivially remotely crashable.
Of course it'll always be much faster to use aligned accesses that do not
need an exception.

get_unaligned() or a memcpy to a local variable is the standard method.
get_unaligned is normally slightly faster than relying on an unalignment
exception handler.

Yes, it's the best solution.
