Wouldn't it make sense to make either two register functions or one
that takes an extra argument?
register_led(.., .., ..)
and
register_led_irq(.., .., ..)
?
Then register_led() will call register_gpio() and
register_led_irq() will call register_gpio_irq().
If the low level driver (and everything else) can't
be put into busywaiting mode the register_gpio_irq()
will fail which will make register_led_irq() fail.
Naturally it can be
register_led(.., .., ..., use_irq)
and
register_gpio(.., .., .., use_irq)
I haven't looked at the API's so this is just theoretical
on my behalf, but it should solve some issues.
If a driver really really can't be busywait for some reason
then it will fail, otherwise it will switch to busywaiting
instead of sleeping.
Or am I just talking out of my ass?
