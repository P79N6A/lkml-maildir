I'm probably going to be ok with this ... after a bit.
1) First concern - my primary issue:
    One thing I really want to change, the name of the per-cpuset file
    that controls this option.  You call it "interleave_over_allowed".
    Take a look at the existing per-cpuset file names:
	    $ grep 'name = "' kernel/cpuset.c
	    .name = "cpuset",
	    .name = "cpus",
	    .name = "mems",
	    .name = "cpu_exclusive",
	    .name = "mem_exclusive",
	    .name = "sched_load_balance",
	    .name = "memory_migrate",
	    .name = "memory_pressure_enabled",
	    .name = "memory_pressure",
	    .name = "memory_spread_page",
	    .name = "memory_spread_slab",
	    .name = "cpuset",
    The name of every memory related option starts with "mem" or "memory",
    and the name of every memory interleave related option starts with
    "memory_spread_*".
    Can we call this "memory_spread_user" instead, or something else
    matching "memory_spread_*" ?
    The names of things in the public API's are a big issue of mine.
2) Second concern - lessor code clarity issue:
    The logic surrounding current_cpuset_interleaved_mems() seems a tad
    opaque to me.  It appears on the surface as if the memory policy code,
    in mm/mempolicy.c, is getting a nodemask from the cpuset code by
    calling this routine, as if there were an independent per-cpuset
    nodemask stating over what nodes to interleave for MPOL_INTERLEAVE.
    But all that is returned is either (1) an empty node mask or (2) the
    current tasks allowed cpu mask.  If an empty mask is returned, this
    tells the MPOL_INTERLEAVE code to use the mask the user specified in
    an earlier set_mempolicy MPOL_INTERLEAVE call.  If a non-empty mask
    is returned, then the previous user specified mask is ignored and
    that non-empty mask (just all the current cpusets allowed nodes) is
    used instead.
    Restating this in pseudo code, from your patch, the mempolicy.c
    MPOL_INTERLEAVE code to rebind memory policies after a cpuset
    changes reads:
	tmp = current_cpuset_interleaved_mems();
	if tmp empty:
		rebind over tmp (all the cpusets allowed nodes)
		break;
	rebind over the set_mempolicy MPOL_INTERLEAVE specified mask
	break;
    The above code is assymmetric, and the returning of a nodemask is
    an illusion, suggesting that cpusets might have an interleaved
    nodemask separate from the allowed memory nodemask.
    How about instead of your current_cpuset_interleaved_mems() routine
    that returns a nodemask, rather have a routine that returns a Boolean,
    indicating whether this new flag is set, used as in:
	if (cpuset_is_memory_spread_user())
		tmp = cpuset_current_mems_allowed();
	else
		nodes_remap(tmp, pol->v.nodes, *mpolmask, *newmask);
	pol->v.nodes = tmp;
    I'll wager this saves a few bytes of kernel text space as well.
3) Maybe I haven't had enough caffiene yet third issue:
    The existing kernel code for mm/mempolicy.c:mpol_rebind_policy()
    looks buggy to me.  The node_remap() call for the MPOL_INTERLEAVE
    case seems like it should come before, not after, updating mpolmask
    to the newmask.  Fixing that, and consolidating the multiple lines
    doing "*mpolmask = *newmask" for each case, into a single such line
    at the end of the switch(){} statement, results in the following
    patch.  Could you confirm my suspicions and push this one too.
    It should be a part of your patch set, so we don't waste Andrew's
    time resolving the inevitable patch collisions we'll see otherwise.
