Have you observed an actual problem?  I don't think the "race" you seem to
be concerned about is a problem at all.
The comment refers to the necessary atomicity of posting the signal along
with doing the wakeups.  Those are done together with the siglock held.
It does not matter that the siglock was dropped and reacquired before
there.  All that matters is that we hold the siglock continuously from
before the wake_up_state calls made in handle_stop_signal through until
after the signal-posting done by its callers.
Can you enumerate the specific sequence of events that would result in
error under the current code?
Thanks,
Roland
