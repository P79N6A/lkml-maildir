Subject: HFS+ Bug which causes coreutils "make test" to fail

I'm installing my system using an HFS+ partition as root.
When I installed the GNU coreutils, I noticed that some test fail, even 
though they succeed on other fs such as ext2.
I've tracked down one failure to the following:
mkdir a; chmod 1777 a; touch a/b; su otheruser -c "rm -rf a"
gives differing results. On ext2:
rm: cannot remove 'a': Permission denied
On HFS+:
rm: reading directory 'a/b': Not a directory
rm: cannot remove directory 'a': Directory not empty
The other failure related to the fact that all pipe files are suffixed 
by "|", and all links by "@" when doing "ls -1F" on HFS+
