Bill,
I did not remember kudzu's parsing of the "port" field as well as I thought.
It does a string match against the first three labels, "uart", "port", and 
"irq". So, if I change the second label to "mem" for ports that are mapped 
into memory space, then it will break kudzu. In function InitSerials(), 
pointer variable "port" becomes null at pciserial.c:61 and causes strchr() 
to explode at line pciserial.c:71. (kudzu-0.99.23 from Red Hat 7.2) 
The only way we could differentiate I/O and memory addresses without 
breaking the current kudzu (that I could think of at my present caffeine 
level) would be to leave it "port" and output four hex digits for I/O 
addresses and eight digits for memory addresses. (just a bit ugly)
All,
Is this correction of information presented to the user from the driver 
worth changing kudzu? Opinions please. 
Best regards,
Ed Vance
