Oh yeah dear GOD - rrright, those bugs - some greater GOD than you
mandated that you look at them and fix them.
Go sue all those producing binary drivers and demonstrate legally they
are doing something illegal before claiming junk. Or at least offer

unless you do at least one of these - all you spoke is more troll than
