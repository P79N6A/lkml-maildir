Yes. You need to load aic7xxx.o, the SCSI driver. in /etc/modules.conf
you need:
alias scsi_hostadapter scsi_mod
alias scsi_hostadapter sd_mod
alias scsi_hostadapter aic7xxx
alias block-major-8 sd_mod
alias block-major-11 sr_mod
alias char-major-9 st
That should get your SCSI stuff running including tape and CDROM.
