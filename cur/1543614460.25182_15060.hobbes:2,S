Hi
i have the same problem weith a 40GB disk
its not a linux problem but a bios / disk problem
my workaround:
dont set the jumper on the disk to make it look smaller.
this however will stop it working in the bios so you need to
disable the disk in the bios completly and turn off the ide
auto detection process in the bios this is because it will
probably hang if you try to use it :)
linux will then pick the disk up from the ide controller.
