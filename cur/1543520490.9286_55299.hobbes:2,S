But this code can be compiled as module as well (may be not right now, though).
And then you can use any license at your choice. You need GPL if you want to
link it statically in kernel and you can add proprietary extensions (as MPL
allows) when using it as module. What's wrong here ?

Link - no. Load as module - yes. So MPL is usable here.
