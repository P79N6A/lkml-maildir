In my case, the DSL modem to ethernet acts as a bridge, not a router.
There would be no additional IP addresses needed, unless you are using
the system as a firewall. I'm using NAT for that (three systems, one is
the firewall) and only have one IP address. See 
http://www.cats-chateau.net
for a (mostly) up to date configuration description. (the dual attached
SCSI works under Linux, but causes windows to have hartburn with constant
SCSI resets...). If your site is already behind an acceptable firewall
by your ISP you can plug the DSL into a hub instead.
