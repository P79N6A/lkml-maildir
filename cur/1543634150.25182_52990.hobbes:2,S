If there is only the one task, then sure it's going to be 100% cpu on that task.
However, if there is anything else other than the idle task that wants to run,
then it should run until it exhausts its timeslice.
One process looping on sched_yield() and another one doing calculations should
result in almost the entire system being devoted to calculations.
