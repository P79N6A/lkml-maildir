I think you pretty well have it covered. 
getnstimeofday + wall_to_monotonic should be higher-res and more
reliable (then TSC based sched_clock(), for example) for getting a
timestamp.
There may be performance concerns as you have to access the clock
hardware in getnstimeofday(), but there really is no other way for
reliable finely grained monotonically increasing timestamps.
