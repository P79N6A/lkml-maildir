I've only had a very quick look, but this line looks *very* wrong.
You should be using PG_private.
There should never be any confusion about whether ->private has
buffers or blocks attached as the only routines that ever look in
->private are address_space operations  (or should be.  I think 'NULL'
is sometimes special cased, as in try_to_release_page.  It would be
good to do some preliminary work and tidy all that up).
Why do you think you need PG_blocks?
