Someone has to do the job, and IMHO Michael does it very well.
Why do you think it would be a good idea if every patch would
be submitted by a differnt person?

There isn't a single maintainer. The different drivers in linuxtv.org
CVS are maintained by different people.

I beg to differ. IMHO patches sent to the list from anyone are
invaluable input, especially (but not only) if they solve
actual bugs.
Anyway, the *only* reason why the linux-dvb list is closed is
the fear of spam. We are currently discussing whether to open
linux-dvb or create a second, open list for patch submission
only. It depends on the ability of the list admins to configure
effective spam filters.
