I don't know if having two (or more) spinlocks on the same cacheline is a good 
idea.  Right now, on a 128 B cacheline we have 10 spinlocks on the
same cacheline here!! Things get worse if two futexes from different nodes 
hash on to adjacent, or even nearly adjacent hash buckets.

Given a decent hash function.  I am not sure the hashing function is smart 
enough as of now.  Hashing is not a function of nodeid, and we have some 
instrumentation results which show hashing on NUMA is not good as yet, and
there are collisions from other nodes onto the same hashbucket; Nearby 
buckets have high hit rates too.
I think some sort of NUMA friendly hashing, where futexes from same nodes
hash onto a node local hash table, would be a decent solution here.
As I mentioned earlier, we are working on that, and we can probably allocate
the spinlock from nodelocal memory then and avoid this bloat.
We are hoping to have this as a stop gap fix until we get there.
Thanks,
Kiran
