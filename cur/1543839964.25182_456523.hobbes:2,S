Possibly an issue, but why would you ever want stacked paravirt-ops?  
You're only talking to the hypervisor directly above you, and there is 
only one of those.

Yes, locking is an issue, but it is possible to do.  You just need to 
stop interrupts, NMIs, and faults on all processors simultaneously.  
Actually, it's not that scary - since you'll be doing it in a hypervisor.

You can patch back over it.  I've already implemented the locking and 
repatching bits for VMI.
