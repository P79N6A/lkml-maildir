It does that only for people with editors which wrap stuff like that
into column 1. Those people (which includes myself on some occasions)
are _used_ to seeing stuff like that in column 1, so it's natural. And
it's text which is of little importance; not something which has much
relevance to the code flow.

No, it looks like crap for _some_ people. And making it look like crap
for _everyone_, which is what your patch does, doesn't alter that fact
either.
It's a simple memcpy(dest, src, len), and the length is almost entirely
superfluous -- we could almost get away with '*dest = *src' here. It
lives on a single line and is messy any other way, and you want to muck
about with it just because there are some poor sods out there for whom
it would look _slightly_ better if you make it look like crap for the
rest of us.
I'm not advocating a blanket removal of the 80-character limit;
important things should always be within 80 columns. But this is fluff;
leave it where it is, please.
