Didn't I cover this in the announcement?
It appears that making smbfs depend on CONFIG_BROKEN doesn't seem to be
enough to get it removed from .config's by make oldconfig. d_validate()
is bad, trust me on this one. Is cifs a good enough replacement for you?

That's relatively unusual; for one, I can't imagine why it's bothering to
stop pid 0 (or why it thinks it should or can). I'll have to try non-APM
-based suspend for this.
