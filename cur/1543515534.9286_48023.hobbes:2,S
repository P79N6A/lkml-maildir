Yes, I know....  Sounds like you might have missed part of the thread...

I know this also...  I'm just trying to be pragmatic as opposed purist...
I believe that sometimes there are exceptions..  If you read back through
the rest of the thread you'll see that my gripe is with the fact that if
you just want to do a simple kernel compile you pretty much have to keep
your source in /usr/src/linux (or have /usr/src/linux symlink to where they
are) in order for the header files that the "helper programs" use to find
the correct kernel header files...  There's no guarantees that they won't
ever change..  In my hobbiest environment at home..  Yeah, who cares...  As
long as I can get it to build..  But in a commercial environment it is seen
as a big deal...

I'll try to take a look...
