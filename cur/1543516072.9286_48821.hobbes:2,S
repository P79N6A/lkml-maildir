Hi Joe,
As Edgar pointed out, the current code for FAT already permits an
(ab-)use similar to what you propose. It is a gross hack, but for
the moment that's also what I am doing to at least partially work
around the problem:
  if (gettimeofday(&tv, &tz)) die("getting time");
  now=time(0);
  t=localtime(&now);
  tz.tz_dsttime=(t->tm_isdst);
  tz.tz_minuteswest=MINUTESWEST;
  if (settimeofday(&tv, &tz)) die("setting time");
If you execute this prior to mounting a FAT file system, it will
at least for dates in the current DST interval show correct file
date/time.
