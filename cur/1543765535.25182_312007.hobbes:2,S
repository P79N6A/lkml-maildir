Hello all,
I have a question that I could not figure out from other sources. I have
the following hardware: an integrated CardBus USB host adapter with a
connected USB serial device with three interfaces (normally
ttyUSB0...ttyUSB2). Now I want to use 3 of these devices (remember: they
are integrated, so I can't just plug the USB device onto the same host
adapter). I know device A is in CardBus slot 1, device B is in CardBus
slot 2 and so on. 
Now the question: How do I figure out which ttyUSBx belongs to which
device?
Thanks in advance
  Joerg
