Thanks, thoses added many missing devices.
Are there usable patches to add these? url?
 - floppy devices (propably not necessary)
 - alsa sound devices (snd/ and sound/ (oss emulation))
 - input devices
 - printer devices
For my machine I compared udev and devfs and those are
the only devices not present in sysfs. I searched linux-kernel
archives for patches to add those, but couldn't find anything.
