Yes, we are not consistent here with or without this patch.
Btw, a question: we are buggy or just "not perfect" ? After all, the
main thread actually exits although this is just linux's implementation
detail.

Yep. kill_pid_info() does exactly this. Initially I was going to repeat

but actually it doesn't buy much here.
Suppose that the main thread is already dead (dequeued SIGKILL), but
not yet released. This window is not that small. In that window (before
de_thread() switches pids) any private signal (even SIGKILL) sent to the
main thread will be silently lost.
To do a proper fix, we should change de_thread() so that the new leader
also "inherits" old_leader->pending signals.
This is certainly possible as a separate change.
Oleg.
