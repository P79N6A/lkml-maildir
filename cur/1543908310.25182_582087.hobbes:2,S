This suggests a bug in the device's firmware, probably it sends a 
1-byte Device-Status reply instead of a 2-byte reply as required by the 
USB spec.  You could find out for certain by using usbmon.
But if that is indeed the problem, the patch below should help.  I've 
seen it before; perhaps we should adopt this workaround permanently.

If necessary you could disable autosuspend for your drive.  But first 
test this patch.
