Subject: [PATCH] Configure.help: Bad URL for CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/8/18/104

The provided URL for more information re SYN Cookies is bad.  I
originally posted a patch to fix this in the 2.4-pre series but it was
not merged.  I am reposting because I was in need of the URL and again
got stuck on the stale URL in Configure.help.
This is against Configure.help 2.41, as in 2.4.8-ac7.
