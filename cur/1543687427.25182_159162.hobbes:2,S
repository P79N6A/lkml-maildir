And there are keyboards with such keys.

Do you know what keystrokes cause this?
It looks like this cannot come from i8042_unxlate_table[].
Do you set i8042_direct?
Vojtech, this sounds like a bug in i8042.c:
We do
	if (data > 0x7f) {
		index = (data & 0x7f);
		if (test_and_clear_bit(index, i8042_unxlate_seen)) {
			data = i8042_unxlate_table[data & 0x7f];
		}
	} else {
		data = i8042_unxlate_table[data];
	}
	serio_interrupt(&i8042_kbd_port, data, dfl, regs);
In other words, the keyboard sends something in translated Set 2,
but we fake that it is untranslated, unless it was
a key release and we didnt know that the key was down.
Thus, atkbd.c gets a mixture of untranslated and translated codes.
