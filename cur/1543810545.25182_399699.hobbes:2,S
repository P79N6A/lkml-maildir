There can be holes in terms of which pages are instantiated, and in
terms of what's mapped but with this patch we always reserve space
from the beginning of the file.  This is a simplifying assumption, so
that i_blocks alone can store sufficient information about what pages
are pre-reserved.  Otherwise we'd either need individual information
about the reservation status of each page - and there's no obvious
place to store it, or we'd have to deduce it in multiple places by
working through each vma which might map the page.  Andy Whitcroft's
old hugepage strict reservation patch used the latter approach, I
invented this i_blocks method because it seems to be simpler.

Ok, I'll add some more explanation here.

Given that the patch below seems to introduce more code that the
above, but scattered across several places, and the hugepage
accounting code would be its only user, I don't see the point.
