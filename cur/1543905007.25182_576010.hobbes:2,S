Thanks for babbling!
I'm having these same intermittent problems starting around 2.6.21, and 
wasn't really sure if it was hardware or not, so didn't bother reporting 
them.  This is what I see sometimes in the logs:
=====================================
PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:PS2K,PNP0f03:PS2M] at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: PC Speaker as /class/input/input3
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input4
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse as /class/input/input5
psmouse.c: bad data from KBC - bad parity
psmouse.c: Wheel Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, 
throwing 2 bytes away.
=====================================
Thanks!
