Hi Ingo & the other contributors of CFS,
I just wanted to say thank you for your excellent job on this scheduler :)
I didn't want to tell anything about v24 too fast since testing takes
its time ;)
so here my experience so far:
- no sound stuttering anymore during internet sound streaming even
during heavy compiling (maybe there's still stuttering but I can't
hear it *g*)
- desktop feels really responsive
- even firefox with around 30 tabs and fully used memory (4 GB) &
fully used swap (2.5 GB) stil feels quite responsive & great to work
with (probably it's also thanks to ck-patchset I'm using besides cfs
-> zen-sources)
- haven't tested 3d FPS so can't tell
keep up the great work !
Greetings
Mat
