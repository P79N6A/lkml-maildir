kmod + modprobe are doing fine, thanks.

BTW, what do I access to get at the ZIP drive (i.e., today /dev/sda4 on my
machine)? It can't be /dev/sda4 if that piece of naming is done by devfsd,
which might decide today it's /dev/scsi/ppa/0/4... which obviously doesn't
exist until I tell the kernel to go looking for it? OK, I could look it up
in a magic place in /proc... but if I don't want to mount proc (perhaps for
security reasons, or whatever)? Anyway, now I'm dependent on a magic file
in /proc (with _that_ specific format!) that does not exist anywhere else
(bye, bye portability) _and_ /dev, and perhaps more stuff. Also, the above
might give rise to races.
And "Need Zip drive... OK, look how it should be called today...(root
around in /proc)... OK, it's called /dev/foo today, go access /dev/foo so
the kernel goes looking for it... nope, not found" sounds harder on the
user than "Look for /dev/zip (or whatever it is called _always_ in /dev),
if not found give up". Many programs will just go /dev/foo, and introduce
subtle bugs.

The problem with this is that it adds one more program that _must_ work in
order for the system to be minimally functional. No devfsd ==> no /usr _at
all_, you can't even mount it by hand! And not because the filesystem is
shot.
I see all these proposals as introducing complexity for the sake of solving
problems that have already been solved (perhaps not with maximal elegance,
but with a working solution). Problems that aren't really important in that
they need to be addressed perhaps a dozen times during the lifetime of a
typical system.
