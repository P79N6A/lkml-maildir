You've no idea how a GPU works have you ?
The process generally goes something like this.
I build an OpenGL rendering context.
The supporting library JITs an engine which implements this rendering
context and pipeline. Only a JIT is really fast enough because there are
so many tests are otherwise involved.
Each poly is fired down the JIT engine which produces a mix of
	- AGP command streams
	- GPU bytecodes
	- Polygon breakdowns which go back into the engine
		(eg for clips the chip can't do)
	- Texture loads and swaps
The GPU view of the universe is far far from the OpenGL one. With the
possible exception of the big 3D Labs cards anyway.
