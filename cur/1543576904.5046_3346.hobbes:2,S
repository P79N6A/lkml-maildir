A BIOS upgrade fixes this, as well as some major problems
with large IDE drives. I have the same motherboard and had
the same problem until I updated the BIOS. Their ChangeLog
even says "Systems running Linux can now properly shutdown."
http://www.soyo.com.tw/cgi-bin/prodinfo.exe?track=regular&board586=5EMAFamily&bios=1
 will get you to the page, and get the latest file
for the 5EMA+. In fact, I'll even be kind enough to provide the
disk image I used with DOS and the bios image and updater on
it. Put in a blank 1.4MB floppy disk, download this file from
http://vitelus.com/aaronl/biosdisk.img,
 and run as root:
  dd if=biosdisk.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 conv=sync ; sync
Then boot of the floppy and run the updater with the bios file as an
argument. I forget which is which but the updater ends in .EXE and the
bios image ends in .BIN.
Let it finish and reboot into Linux. Good luck.
