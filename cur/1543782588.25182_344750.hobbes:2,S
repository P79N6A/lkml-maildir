Probably POSIX, SuSv3 and similiar.

There you have basically text files with some structure in it and the
definiton/requirement that is is UTF-8.
At kernel level these are also just byte streams and the kernel doesn't
know or care which charset, encoding, file format, font etc. the data is
used with or interpreted several layers higher, e.g. for presenting to
the user. And the same holds for filenames.
