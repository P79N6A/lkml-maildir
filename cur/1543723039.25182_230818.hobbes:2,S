I agree that most often the granularity of debugging needs to be at the driver
level. But I was just taking my lead from dev_dbg(), which uses '#ifdef DEBUG'
in the same way I've proposed. I would argue that the enabling/disabling of
dev_dbg() is also something one would want to control at the driver level. I'm
assuming people do this by adding a '#define DEBUG' prior to the driver's
#include of <linux/kernel.h> which has a #include of <asm/bug.h>.
The dev_printk() family of macros is a good example of what I'm interested in.
They have a set of macros (dev_err(), dev_warn(), dev_info()) that are always
enabled. Then there is dev_dbg() which is only enabled if DEBUG is defined.
(I'm not defending the choice of DEBUG as the enabling switch. I'm merely
interested in having the ability to enable/disable BUG_ON() when the driver
is built.)

I would agree that there are two basic flavors of ASSERT()-like macros; one
that printks some info and then Oops the system, and the other that simply
printks some info. So I would suggest providing both options, something like:
    #ifdef DEBUG
    #define DBUG_ON(condition)  BUG_ON(condition)
    #define DWARN_ON(condition) WARN_ON(condition)
    #else
    #define DBUG_ON(condition)  do { if (condition) { /* nothing */ } } while (0)
    #define DWARN_ON(condition) do { if (condition) { /* nothing */ } } while (0)
    #endif
 
(I really don't care what the names of these macros end up being. Again, I'm
just interested in a BUG_ON()/WARN_ON()-like mechanism that is conditionally
compiled in (enabled) by some type of #ifdef switch (like DEBUG) and is
'sanctioned' by the community for use by drivers.)
 
Thanks,
Dean
