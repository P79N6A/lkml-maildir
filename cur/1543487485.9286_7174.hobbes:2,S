[1.] One line summary of the problem:
[scsi fdomain bug?]  --  bug: kernel timer adder twice at c01b0409
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
compiling 2.2.2 work without anz problems but when booting it, it
hangs after
>scsi0: <fdomain> No BIOS; using scsi id 7
>scsi0: <fdomain> TMC-36C70 (PCI bus) chip at 0xd000 irq 10
>scsi0 : Future Domain 16-bit SCSI Driver Version 5.50scsi : 1 host.

>Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.52
and prints:
>bug: kernel timer adder twice at c01b0409
with my working 2.2.1 it would continue with
>scsi: <fdomain> REQUEST SENSE Key = 2, Code = 3a, Qualifier = 0
>sr1: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.
>sr1: scsi3-mmc drive: 0x/0x caddy

[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
kernel, scsi, fdomain, aha1920, boot
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
<could not boot new kernel>
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic
information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
<no Oops message>
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
<N/A error occurs during boot>
[7.] Environment
<N/A error occurs during boot>
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
I downloaded 2.2.1 (from at.kernel.org?) as a complete .tar.gz and got
the 2.2.2.bz2 patch (from gd.tuwien.ac.at) to patch it to 2.2.2
BIOS boot infos:
Award Modular BIOS v4.51PG, An Energy Star Ally
..copyright stuff
ASUS P2B ACPI BIOS Revision 1005
<..>
Adaptex AHA-2920/2920A BIOS v 3.2 as a SCSI controller.
I've put up information which might be relevant on my website at
http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~ppalfrad/kernel/
 to not spam the
mailinglist?
those things are:
the boot logs from 2.2.2 which hangs and from 2.2.1 which runs without
any problems
output of ver_linux
the .config file generated by menuconfig
CPUINFO (from /proc while running 2.2.1)
ls -R in /proc/scsi: (from /proc while running 2.2.1)
these things will be up approx. 1 month
You guys really do a great job!! Thank you!
