Well you -could- do this:
- reuse a long in struct page as a used map that divides the page up
  into 32 or 64 segments
- every time you set a PTE, set the corresponding bit in the mask
- when we zap, only visit the regions set in the mask
Thus, you avoid visiting most of a PMD page in the sparse case,
assuming PTEs aren't evenly spread across the PMD.
This might not even be too horrible as the appropriate struct page
should be in cache with the appropriate bits of the mm already locked,
etc.
