I don't believe that devd *needs* to keep this kind of state, however. 
I'm actually pretty sure it doesn't.  That's why I would start by
working on the daemon, and feed it simulated data, before implementing
the kernel interface -- then I'd know better what the requirements
really are, and what the smallest possible implementation would look
like.
