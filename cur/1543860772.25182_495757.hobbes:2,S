I have a mental note that these:
extend-notifier_call_chain-to-count-nr_calls-made.patch
extend-notifier_call_chain-to-count-nr_calls-made-fixes.patch
extend-notifier_call_chain-to-count-nr_calls-made-fixes-2.patch
define-and-use-new-eventscpu_lock_acquire-and-cpu_lock_release.patch
define-and-use-new-eventscpu_lock_acquire-and-cpu_lock_release-fix.patch
eliminate-lock_cpu_hotplug-in-kernel-schedc.patch
eliminate-lock_cpu_hotplug-in-kernel-schedc-fix.patch
handle-cpu_lock_acquire-and-cpu_lock_release-in-workqueue_cpu_callback.patch
should be scrapped.  But really I forget what their status is.  Gautham,
can you please remind us where we're at?
