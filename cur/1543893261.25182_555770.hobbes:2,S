Wow, that is big :-)
I guess smsc-ircc2 still didn't find the device, so you got
something like this:
  smsc_ircc_present(), addr 0x02e8 - no device found!
Right?
I'm out of ideas, and I don't want to waste more of your time on
this.  I'm going to try to find a Portege 4000 to play with myself.
That might take a few days, and I'm going to be out of the office
from June 20-July 9, so I'm afraid it will be slow.  But I *will*
fix it!
