Not yet fixed for me. Here is the error shortly after the very beginning
of the boot:
APIC error on CPU0: 08(08)
APIC error on CPU0: 08(08)
message repeats at this point.
This is on a VALinux 2231 dual p-III with an Intel Server Board STL2.
Same .config which I sent last time.  I can resend if necessary.
CONFIG_SMP=y for this kernel.
[steven@spc9 linux-2.4.19-rc1-ac7]$ grep APIC .config
CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
