make mrproper should not do any difference here.
I rather think you hit some ncurses bug.
If you could add '-g' to HOSTCFLAGS in top-level Makefile
and then do:
rm scripts/kconfig/mconf.o scripts/kconfig/mconf
make menuconfig
(to build mconf and to check that the error is still reproduceable).
And then run it in a debugger like this:
gdb scripts/kconfig/mconf
run arch/x86_64/Kconfig
         ^^^^^^ replace with your actual arch
Provoke the error and get a back-trace with 'bt'.
Thanks,
