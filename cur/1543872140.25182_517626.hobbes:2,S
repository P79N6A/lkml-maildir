Why would it be any different to all the other code we've got behind
native pvops?
The ideal simplified case is that we rename
smp_send_stop/send_reschedule/prepare_cpus/etc to native_* versions.  In
the !PARAVIRT case we just call the native_* version directly; in
PARAVIRT we call via the native pv_ops structure.  Under Xen, all these
would implemented independently from the native versions.

I guess by "rest of the kernel" you mean other stuff in arch/i386.  Yes,
that's a concern, but maybe we can tease it apart in a sensible way.
