Thanks.  That was going to be my next question!
I'm guessing that SCHED_IDLE doesn't get completely starved by a CPU
hog running nice +19, but it would still be interesting to know:
roughly how much of the CPU could the CPU_IDLE process expect to get
in that case?

Also might be useful to add th e answer to this to the man page...
