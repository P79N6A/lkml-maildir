Jeff, 
 what was the resolution to this one? Just revert the offending commit, or 
what?
We're about five weeks into the 2.6.20-rc series. I was hoping for a 
two-month release rather than the usual dragged-out three months, so I'd 
like to get these regressions to be actively fixed. By forcible reverts if 
that is what it takes.
