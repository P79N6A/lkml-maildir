I have a similar system running fine.  It has a Tyan S2460, a pair of
Athlon MP 1800s, 512M (2x256) and a pair of IBM 60G drives.
I haven't seen any signs of kernel instability. However:
  1) When I first got it I had the BIOS do some very odd things; at one
  point the CMOS got cleared and then everything worked from there on
  in.  So a good CMOS clean could be in order. I had to use the Debian
  safe boot set prior to this.
  2) Are you saying the problem only affects greater than 512M ? I only
  have the 512M so don't know - but it is probably worth booting with
  mem=512M as an option with more RAM in and see if it is stable.
  3) The guys who put the machine together had lots of problems getting
  it stable; the type of RAM they used was critical; it was stable
  enough for them to boot NT and get it through a lot of tests before
  they hit problems.
  4) COOL IT - these things generate tons of heat (mine run at 75degC
  normal operation). I have it in a big Supermicro 760 case with damn
  big fans on.
  5) I bought Athlon MPs because I didn't want the hastle of knowing
  whether XPs would work or not.  Now sure, it could be AMD just trying
  to squeeze some more money out of us; but it is entirely possible that
   a) the chips could be different,  b) that the critical timing path in
  the device could be in the cache snooping/consistency stuff (that
  stuff is probably pretty hairy!).  I mean there must be a reason why
  it took them a month and a half longer to release the Athlon MP 1.9GHz
  than the XP 1.9GHz.
  6) I'm currently on 2.4.17 and have used most of the later 2.4.1x's on
  it.
