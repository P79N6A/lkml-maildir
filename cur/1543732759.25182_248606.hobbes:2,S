Ok, thanks.

Yes it sould.
Also with 2.6.9 acpi pnp and pnp will conflic :
the new acpi driver drivers/acpi/motherboard.c reserve the motherboard
resources, but if you look at driver/pnp/system.c, there is also a pnp driver
that does the same jobs. So if PNP0c0[12] appear in pnp layer (with pnpbios),
both driver try to allocate the ressource.
Hopefully it cause only warnings.
But it show the problem and the need of unification instead of reimplant things.
