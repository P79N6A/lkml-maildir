Default rcvbuf is ~64K, it is enough to receive up to mtu of a bit less 64K.
When application says rcvbuf=2K it appearently does not expect to hold
more then one packet.

At least TCP will tune itself nicely under the most extremal conditions.
What's about this case, no chances to tune. rcvbuf just should be large.

rx copybreak has no chances to work in the case of large mtus...
F.e. it does not with gigabit cards, which use 9K mtu, but need
to talk to 1.5K world. Blind copybreak at 1.5K is a non-sense,
meaning "copy all". Though acenic with its three rx rings is
a lucky exception. 8)
