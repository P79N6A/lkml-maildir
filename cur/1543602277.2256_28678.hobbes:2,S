   This results in the actual read taking twice as long.  Perhaps I am missing
   something...
EOF isn't known until you return the zero.  You can watch the loff_t
arg to the read operation to see if it is at the end, and if so just
avoid retouching the device or whatever and go straight to returning
0.
Franks a lot,
