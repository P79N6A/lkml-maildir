Why can't it be moved to other zone if there is a lot of place where ?
In general I was not pushing system in some kind of stress mode - There
was still a lot of cache memory available. Why it could not be instead
shrunk to accommodate allocation ? 
As I understand in my case with 4G there is  Normal zone and HighMem
zone where "user" anonymous memory can be located in any of these zones.
Is this observation correct ?

Aha I see. So user level memory allocations can't cause OOM only kernel
level allocations can ?   In this case why do not you have some reserved
amount of space for these types of allocations by default ? 
In this case I also do not understand how swap space helps here ? If you
can't move page to over zone or shrink cache because of allocation type
how it happens you can however perform page swap ?
