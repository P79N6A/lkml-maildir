ia64 ioremap should work early enough, so it doesn't have fixmap.
Seems like in this case, maybe bt_ioremap() would be more
appropriate than fixmap, since there's no requirement that
virtual address be known at compile-time.

Why do we have to have a new "earlycon" argument?  Why can't we just
parse "console=uart" early?
BTW, if you want to convert it from "console=uart" to "console=8250",
as part of this cleanup, I think that would be OK.  Just make it a
separate patch and don't forget to change drivers/firmware/pcdp.c and
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt at the same time.
