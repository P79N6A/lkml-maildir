Subject: [PATCH]Fix bug in msgrcv/shmat
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello, Linux & Alan,
This patch verifies the message queue ID and the shared memory segment
ID for msgrcv and shmat respectively. These IDs consist of a data
structure index value, and a generation number. As data structures are
re-used, the generation number makes it possible to avoid incorrect
data references. The generation numbers are checked via msg_checkid()
and shm_checkid(). The problem is that msgrcv and shmat do not currently
validate the ID. As a result of this, it is possible to reference and
modify the wrong message queue or shared memory segment with the use of
a stale ID.
This patch is against kernel 2.4.9.  I tested it and it runs well.
Please apply and CC your comments to me also, thanks.
