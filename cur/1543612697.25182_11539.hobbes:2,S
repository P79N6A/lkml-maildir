Why returning non zero from __start_dac() and similar procedures when 
something real has been done there is so bad. Using such return code would
ensure we never try to wait for results of __start_dac() if nothing is done 
by this procedure. I think such way is also more safe against possible future 
modifications as real conditions are only in a single place. Keeping them in 
2 places is possible source of bitrot if driver will be updated in future.
