I've been thinking on reserving another word in the cache-line and use
that as a bit-array to keep that information; the only problems with
that would be atomicy of the {bucket,bit} tuple and very large
cachelines where NUM_NR > 32.

The assumption is that IFF the hash function has good distribution
properties the per bucket distance is a good approximation of
(distance >> nonres_shift).

There being multiple zones; owning zone->lru_lock does not guarantee
uniqueness on the remember_page() path as its a global structure.
