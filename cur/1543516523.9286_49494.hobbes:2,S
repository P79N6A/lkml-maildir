I can understand the point you're making, but would have to point out
that Linux is NOT the main culprit here - that 'honour' belongs to a
certain MacroHard range of products.
To be blunt, where a system needs to dual boot between LoseSleep and
*ANY* decent operating system, and LoseSleep is set to honour DST,
then the RTC *MUST* be run in localtime rather than UTC/GMT as if it
isn't, LoseSleep will trash it for you. If you want to get this fixed,
persuade MacroHard to fix it as they're the only ones who can...
 > Let's say HP-UX 11.0 is a real UNIX if that helps you.
You still haven't convinved me that Linux is any less of a real UNIX,
and arguments that clearly place the blame in the wrong place (like
your argument above does) are unlikely to do so.

You're probably also aware that the most likely reason for that is
that no change has ever been needed since then.

Glancing at my (BT Highway) ISDN-2 connection, I wonder what sort of

Don't tell me, tell them. I don't have any such line in my spam
filter, as should be apparent from the fact that I received your
original email despite it containing the said word...
