I've been trying to find out information on the Linux serial driver.  The
maintainer hasn't updated his web site in a long time, does anyone know if
he's still maintaining it ??
I am asking because I have a uart that isn't directly supported in the
driver and I may need to add support for it, but I don't want to modify the
serial driver unless it can be included in the main distribution channel.
The uart in question is a TI 16C752.   I've tried using it with 16750 and
16650 settings,and it occasionally drops characters or receives duplicate
characters.
