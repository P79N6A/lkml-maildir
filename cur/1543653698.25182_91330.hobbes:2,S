Copyright assignments are only needed for projects for which the FSF holds
the copyright and requires copyright assignments, and then only if one
wants one's code to make it into the GNU-distributed version.
I don't believe it is possible to answer that question with more
granularity without going down to a project-by-project check.  There
certainly have been packages available from ftp.gnu.org that do not
require copyright assignments to contribute to.
