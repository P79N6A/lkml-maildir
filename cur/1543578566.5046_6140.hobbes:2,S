Translation:
You can do a bit level tracking of data and verify that what went down you
get it back across the entire disk.  This can be done in a random-pattern
that does not over-write (obvious) or from head->tail or tail->head.
It works perfectly and exactly as it is defined to work by the rules.
Getting the rules correct == 'the concept of "working"'.
However that model of IO is not complete yet. :-((
