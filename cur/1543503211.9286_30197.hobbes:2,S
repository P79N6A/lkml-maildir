[for the Linux part]
Get a copy of man-pages-1.24 and read unix(7) 
SCM_CREDENTIALS is in newer BSD, but not in most other Unixes afaik.
SCM_RIGHTS is available on most Unixes in slight variations.
A good collection of fd passing functions ported to lots of systems 
is in the old NCSA httpd source.
