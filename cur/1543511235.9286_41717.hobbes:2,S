Tom,
You have to edit a line in hpt366.c NOW!!!!
static int hpt366_tune_chipset (ide_drive_t *drive, byte speed)
- byte regtime            = (drive->select.b.unit & 0x01) ? 0x43 : 0x40;
+ byte regtime            = (drive->select.b.unit & 0x01) ? 0x44 : 0x40;
I am building ide.2.2.12.19991001.patch now.
