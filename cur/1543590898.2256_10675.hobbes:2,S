Note that using dev->name during probe was always incorrect.  Think
about the error case:
device 0:
	dev = init_etherdev(...); /* gets if eth0 */
	printk(... dev->name ...)
	/* prints "eth0: error foo, aborting" */
	failure!  exit and unregister_netdev
device 1:
	dev = init_etherdev(...); /* gets if eth0 */
	printk(... dev->name ...)
	/* prints "eth0: error foo, aborting" */
	failure!  exit and unregister_netdev
device 2:
	dev = init_etherdev(...); /* gets if eth0 */
	printk(... dev->name ...)
	/* prints "eth0: error foo, aborting" */
	failure!  exit and unregister_netdev
So, using interface name in this manner was always buggy because it
conveys no useful information to the user.

I'm all for removing it...  I do not like removing it in a so-called
"stable" series, though.  alloc_etherdev() was enough to solve the race
and flush out buggy drivers using dev->name during probe.  Notice I did
not remove init_etherdev and fix it properly -- IMHO that is 2.5
material.
