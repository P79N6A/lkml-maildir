 Huh.  The first time the lease renewal hung up and I hit ctrl-C when it
didn't seem to be working (tcpdump showed a series of unanswered SYNs.)
Later I let it run to completion and it must have worked, but since there
was no output from the program I assumed it had just failed silently like
some other bitkeeper commands will do. Then the Christmas morning mayhem
hit and I didn't have any more time to play with it.
 You should output a confirmation message when 'bk lease renew' succeeds.
