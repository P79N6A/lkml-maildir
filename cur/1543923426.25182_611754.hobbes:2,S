We'll also need this additional patch (untested), but in the long run
I think the approach needs to be
1. Update stime and utime at the time of context switching -- keep it
   in sync with p->sum_exec_runtime
2. Keep track of system/user context at system call entry points
Extend Peter's patch to fix accounting issues.
