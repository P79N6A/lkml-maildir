I don't want to  use this in glibc for every syscall.  But for your
random application in need of a syscall it's fine.
And there is one more thing: the above code is actually not what should
be used.  The symbol able entries should be position independent.  So
one will have to compute the final address (which will be fun for archs
with function descriptors).  I'll have to see how randomization is
actually implemented.  The __kernel_vsyscall symbol is probably not
changed, so we need an out-of-band mechanisms to report the load address
to the userlevel code.
