*mostly*  The SCxx00 series does integrate the GX1 and CS5530 technology
but with some differences.  The GX1 supports a few higher graphics
resolutions, and the SCxx00 has some PCI bus speed options not supported
in the GX1/CS5530 version.  The timing values and modes are not the same
for the two IDE controllers.
Mark Lord did the initial submissions for CS5530 and SCxx00 series IDE
drivers and considered them different enough at the time to integrate
them separately (to the extant I recall).  (If you're still lurking
Mark, please feel free to correct me on any of this info.)

kernel configuration and capabilities -- same cacheline size, cache
size, capabilities bits (MMX, et. al.), as well as optimal scheduling
for the integer/FPU pipes.  We've found the compiling 486 is the best of
the gcc march's for the GX1/SCxx00 core.  It's unlikely that an GX1
specific scheduling will find it's way into gcc at this point.

The SC1200 should support DMA, though there may be some restrictions if
DMA and non-DMA devices are connected at the same time (i.e. it may
revert to lowest-common-mode).
