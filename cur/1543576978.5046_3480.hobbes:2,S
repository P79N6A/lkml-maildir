I just checked all architecture manuals I could lay my hands on
(sparcv9, ppc32, mips r4400, parisc 1.1, alpha, sh is somewhere in
storage but as I remember it has it too) 
and they all seem to have at least store byte and mostly store
half words instructions.

iirc the Alpha guys found out that they couldn't drive half of the
available devices without byte store, and since then nobody has 
repeated that mistake @)

I don't see it. Just define x8 to u32 on old alpha and let most other architectures
be happy.
