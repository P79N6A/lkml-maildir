The problem is at compile time and not so much at runtime.
Take a kernel struct that is shared with user (i.e., passed through syscall)
that has the following layout:
	struct foo {
		unsigned long bar;
		int dummy;
	};
For a 64-bit app on a 64-bit OS OR a 32-bit app on a 32-bit OS, this works
perfectly.
For a 32-bit on a 64-bit OS, there is a problem, the 32-bit app must be compiled
with the following definition instead:
	struct foo {
		unsigned long long bar;
		int dummy;
	};
to share the struct with the 64-bit OS. An application compile with the above
struct, would not work when run on a 32-bit OS.
So I think that we need to replace all unsigned long, size_t, void * by uint64_t
to make sure this works either way. It is overkill on pure 32-bit but ensures
that the application can be migrated over to a 64-bit OS without the need for
special recompilation.
