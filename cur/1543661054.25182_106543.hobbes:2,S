Hello.
I run kernel-2.4.18. 
When kernel receives ICMP redirect message, only store ICMP redirect in the route cache,
not in the routeing tables.
I have a question.
Why doesn't kernel store ICMP redirect in the routing tables?
In kernel-2.4.18, when new route is added(or existed route is deleted)
and route become old, kernel flushs the route cache.
If kernel doesn't store ICMP redirect in the routing tables,
kernel will send packet to wrong gateway whenever flush the route cache.
Is it no matter that it generates ICMP redirect every time flush the route cache?  
Please tell me why kernel has such a specification that doesn't store ICMP redirect
in the routing tables.
Regards.
