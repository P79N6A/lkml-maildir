Subject: [Regression in 2.6.25-rcX] CD/DVD writer no longer works

Hello,
I am using Debian Sid on a Toshiba A100 laptop. My CD/DVD
writer functions very well on 2.6.23.16 and 2.6.24.2.
I tried 2.6.25-rc2-git7, and I was very sad to notice that
when I tried to write a CD, wodim started to output the
following: "Warning: controller returns zero sized CD
capabilities page."
Since I was able to use this CD/DVD writer successfully with
previous versions of Linux, I believe that this is a regression
in 2.6.25-rcX series.
I am willing to try patches and to do pretty much anything
to debug/fix this problem.
Thanks in advance.
Note: I am attaching the output of wodim to this e-mail.
