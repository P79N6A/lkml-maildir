unsigned long long.
It worked.  I made this change after applying the patch
previously posted by Mr. Roeland.  I think the present
workaround might also work without the previous patch,
and will try it that way if I have time.
Again this is with Red Hat's nonstandard gcc 2.96.
At the moment it looks like Red Hat's gcc is to blame here.
