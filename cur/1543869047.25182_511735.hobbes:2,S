Hi! Using netconsole, i was able to capture some printk output.
Following some advices in the net (forum threads about similar
problems), i did this to enable more verbose printk printing:
echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump
This was the result:

However, i'm not still sure i enabled as much debugging info as i
could in the kernel configuration. If you need more, please point me
to precise configuration options.
Thanks for your response.
