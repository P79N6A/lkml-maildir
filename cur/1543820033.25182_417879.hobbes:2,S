I think it would be saner to explicitly specify the size of the field. 
That means using s32 and s64 throughout this code.
That'll actually save space on 64-bit machines, where we're presently doing
alloc_percpu(long) when all we need is alloc_percpu(s32).
We'd need to review all users of this interface to make sure that they
handle the changed sizes appropriately, too.
