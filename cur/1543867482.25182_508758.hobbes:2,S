hm, there must be some misunderstanding here. That mlock is /only/ once 
per the lifetime of the whole 'head' - i.e. per sys_async_register(). 
(And you can even forget i ever did it - it's 5 lines of code to turn 
the completion ring into a swappable entity.)
never does any MMU trick ever enter the picture during the whole 
operation of this thing, and that's very much intentional.
