2.5 on alpha appears to be quite incomplete right now. The module 
load/unload code appears to be completely out of sync with the other 
archs though some parts that suggest implementation is currently 
underway can be found . Still include/asm-alpha/module.h is empty thus 
struct mod_arch_specific does not exist and you encounter the above 
mentioned error.
Ive been working on implementing some missing bits but what Id like to 
know is who is "officially" doing development for alpha on 2.5.
