Hi,
Is there any chance that RAID volumes would support partitions like the
hard-disk driver in the future? This could be handsome if you try to
program a kernel driver for any of those RAID adapters (e.g. thinking of
those Fasttrack or Highpoint lowcost IDE controllers). A RAID
personality could take over all the controller specific stuff.
I have done this for the Highpoint HTP370, which is found on some of the
new ABIT mainboards. I am running a dualboot system (Win98/Linux) on one
RAID volume with two partitions (a swap partition is not supported on
raid devices). And LILO boots it! *joy*
I have created a patch for this which applies to kernel 2.2.18. This
does the partition trick and contains a mixture of the RAID-0 and RAID-1
code to do the disk striping (only disk striping is supported). So if
anyone is interrested in the patch contact me. But be aware that
installation is not a piece of cake!
