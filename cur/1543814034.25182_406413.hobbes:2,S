I am trying to document PTRACE_SETOPTIONS and I can't figure out what
the option PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD is used for.  Google is no help;
I can't find an explanation for _why_ it's there.  All I can see is that
it causes ptrace() to deliver syscall stops with SIGTRAP | 0x80
instead of just SIGTRAP and it can be used with PTRACE_SYSEMU.
