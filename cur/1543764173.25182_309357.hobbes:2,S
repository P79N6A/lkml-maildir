Yes. It seems a good place to hide compiler-internal stuff as the one 
this patch
implements. And I know linux does not exactly have a great track record
on this issue. But just because the dependency is there, does not imply 
it is a
GOOD THING to have it.
So instead of applying this patch, simply
#ifdef VERSION_MINOR < WHATEVER
#define va_copy __va_copy
#endif
in include/linux/compiler_gcc2.h
Thus solving the problem without having to invade compiler namespace all
over the place, but doing so in *one* place only.

Things seem to have improved a bit lately. The gcc-3.x series was
basically not worth it for plain C until 3.3 or so.

Yes. You did read the actual data as produced by that guy from Suse, 
did you? In the past,
people may have justly stuck to (e.g.) 2.95.3, however, support for 
that version now starts to
require dependencies on compiler internals. This is one argument in 
favor of dropping support
for that version, or at least not to spread compiler dependent stuff 
all over the code.
