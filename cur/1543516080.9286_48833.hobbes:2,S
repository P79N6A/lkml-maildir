Hi,
I just upgraded to the latest 2.3.28 kernel. Now
everything seems to work fine, until I try to compile
something. (FYI, the thing I am trying to compile is
the head branch of KDE, although the problem I'm about
to describe has happened when I cimpiled something
else with a lot of files as well -- wine)
When I run make, the compile chugs along fine, then
after a while (I have detected no pattern) it dies
saying something like
__________________________________________
In function `Some function here`:
Internal compiler error.
Please submit a full bug report
See
<URL:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/faq.html#bugreport>
for instructions
--------------------------------------------------
Now after this if I just type make again, it works
fine and starts from where it left off and goes on for
a while until it dies again. So after three of four
retries, it finally finishes, and nothing seems to be
wrong with the compiled stuff.
I cannot recreate this reliably, and it does not
happen on the same file each time. So I have no idea
what's going on.
I am using
gcc 2.95.2
libc6 2.1.2
Is this a kernel problem or a compiler problem? How
can I find out?
Thanks for any assistance,
Ant
