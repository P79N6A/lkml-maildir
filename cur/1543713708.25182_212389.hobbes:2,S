Just to make confusion perfect: my patch lets me work in AGP V3.0
on SiS 746. Just in case here is the relevant part of my lspci:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]: Unknown device 0746 (rev 02)
	Subsystem: Elitegroup Computer Systems: Unknown device 1808
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0
	Memory at d0000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128M]
	Capabilities: [c0] AGP version 3.0
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device 0312 (rev a1) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
	Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 248, IRQ 11

this is a ECS L7S7A2 mainboard and a NoName (Manli) GeForce
