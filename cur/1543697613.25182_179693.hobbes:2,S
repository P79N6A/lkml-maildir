At risk of sounding like second level support,
  1. Are you able to copy the raw partitions (e.g. using dd) to
     another disk or system?
  2. Do you see similar error messages when copying the raw partitions?
  3. When you mount the _copies_ of the partitions, do you see similar
     error messages?
That'll differentiate whether it's a pure disk/driver problem or
something triggered by a filesystem problem.  As a bonus, if the disks
are both dying (maybe you had a lightning strike), then you'll have
the data copied somewhere safe.
