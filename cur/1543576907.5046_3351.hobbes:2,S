It looks like 2.4.0-test13-pre7 is a clear winner when running dbench 48
on my somewhat slow test machine (450 Mhz P-III, 192MB, IDE).
2.2.18                3.53307 MB/sec (NB=4.41633 MB/sec  35.3307 MBit/sec)
2.2.19-pre3           3.81213 MB/sec (NB=4.76516 MB/sec  38.1213 MBit/sec)
2.4.0-test13-pre5     4.06823 MB/sec (NB=5.08529 MB/sec  40.6823 MBit/sec)
2.4.0-test13-pre6     4.11353 MB/sec (NB=5.14192 MB/sec  41.1353 MBit/sec)
2.4.0-test13pre4-ac2  4.47376 MB/sec (NB=5.5922  MB/sec  44.7376 MBit/sec)
2.4.0-test13-pre7     6.3723  MB/sec (NB=7.96538 MB/sec  63.723  MBit/sec)
The tests were done under identical conditions, after fresh boot-up,
running KDE 2.0, one xterm, and xosview.
Here are a few selected lines from dmesg to put things in perspective.
Detected 448.810 MHz processor.
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
hda: ST317221A, ATA DISK drive
Using r5 hash to sort names
reiserfs: using 3.5.x disk format
ReiserFS version 3.6.23
This is really looking great.
