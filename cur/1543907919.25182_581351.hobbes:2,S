I'm confused, do you say this in reference to anything i said? I did not 
say that RR tasks are deprecated and you were top-posting so i cannot 
connect it to anything specific. I only said RR tasks are _rare_:

and i hope you can see the difference between 'rare' and 'deprecated' 
;-) And i suspect you also missed the last bit of what i wrote:

and you also missed the first bit it appears:

so you are banging, with full force, on completely open doors =B-)
