They aren't.  On some of our platforms, we have to exclusive-or the address
for byte accesses with 3 to convert to the right endian-ness.
Sure, from the point of view of which byte each byte of a word represents,
it's true that they're indentical.  But as far as the hardware is concerned,
they're definitely different.
See the Intel IXP platforms for an example.
