Neither in menuconfig nor in xconfig do I see any place to actually select 
INPUT. Help text suggests that it is a) selectable b) it can be made modules. 
I do not have either option. Here what I see in menuconfig if I go into Input 
device support:
    --- Generic input layer (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...)
    < >   Support for memoryless force-feedback devices
    ---   Userland interfaces
as you see there is no check box for INPUT itself.
I already had similar issue something else (I believe it was something related 
to serio). In menuconfig item was no selectable, but I could directly 
edit .config to change y to m.
This may be related to
  Symbol: INPUT [=y]
  Prompt: Generic input layer (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...)
    Defined at drivers/input/Kconfig:7
    Depends on: EMBEDDED
    Location:
      -> Device Drivers
        -> Input device support
    Selected by: VT
and CONFIG_VT is indeed y (I do not think this even can ever be m). Still even 
then this is way too confusing.
.config can be provided on request
