If that's equivalent to 2.5.44 +
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/dwmw2/bk-2.5/cset-1.808-to-1.869.txt.gz
then I get the same error (incorrect number of segments...). It happened
earlier in the boot process so I couldn't catch the details; it looked
like it oopsed along with everything else.
