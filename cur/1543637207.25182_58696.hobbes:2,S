I meant ->x86_model there, I assume you did too, and you have a 0xF24/0xF27 cpu.
I wasn't aware these were HT aware. In fact, only 0xF50 are confirmed.
Interesting.

Ah ok. I'll install the correct font later.

Something that just nagged me about this code.
Where are those strings stored ? If they're in the same
text as this code, we shouldn't be creating references to them,
as after boot, all this will go poof. (it's __init)
If they are stored there, a simple strdup/memcpy will fix it
of course, but I'm wondering if we even need to. Or does
our linker magic put strings in data sections ?
