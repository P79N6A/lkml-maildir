I note that your driver doesn't handle SMP, which mine does. I've got
plans for adding virtual PMCs, as stated in the documentation for my
driver. Also you haven't supported the rdpmc instruction on P5.
So why did you write a whole new package rather than trying to merge
in virtual PMC support into my driver?
