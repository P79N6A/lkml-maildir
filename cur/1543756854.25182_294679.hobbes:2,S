Correct.

If you look again at the patch I posted, it only borrowed a few lines
of the patch from Dmitry that started this thread; I eliminated Alan's
recent udelay(50) addition, reduced the loop delay, and added debug
printks to the *_wait routines to determine whether the loop is ever taken.
At least so far, those debugging statements have produced no output.
I'll use the machine a bit and report back if I trigger anything.
