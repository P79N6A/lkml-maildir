Wrong indentation in acpi_vgapost; I remember there was better patch
to fix this out there.
Anyway, are you sure machine you have can't be fixed by any methods
listed in Doc*/power/video.txt? I guess they are preferable to
acpi_vgapost...
If not... indent it acording to the coding style and drop "phony
return code" (it is unneeded, anyway, right?) and try again. (Oh and
Cc me ;-).
