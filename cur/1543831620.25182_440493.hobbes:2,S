When queue is congested---it is, because meta-data (indirect blocks in
ext[23] case) have to be read in synchronously before page can be paged
out (see comment in mm/vmscan.c:pageout()).
But much more importantly: when direct reclaim skips writing dirty pages
from tail of the inactive list, it instead moves these pages to the head
of this list, and reclaims clean pages instead. These clean pages are
"hotter" than skipped dirty pages, and as has been checked many times
already, this is bad, because doing reclaim in LRU order is important.
