yes. It cannot define anything greater than the already defined limits.
And even then it is limited to 64 bits on a 64 bit system (unless the
compiler is non-standard - ie "long long" type of thing).
I specified no limits on the definition of integer type ie.:
int	ipv6addr :128; /* 128 bits, integer */
The operators would be the same, the number of bits in the integer object
is selectable at compile time. Using this definition allows
typedef int	int64_t : 64;
as a standard definition. NOT
	typedef long long	int64_t;
which is not ANSI. The syntax is the same as for a bit field, just not
limited to a maximum size of int (whether an int is 16, 32, or 64 bits is
up to the compiler).
