Perfect example of what Andrew Morten stated in his keynote at LinuxTag.
He mentioned patches that fixed warnings but not the problem that they
warn about.  He stated that these are very dangerous, because, not only is
the problem not fixed, but now no one knows of the problem.
Daniel,
We appreciate the clean up of the kernel.  Just try to focus on the
obvious stuff, and maybe only flag those that you're not sure is still a
problem.  Email the author of the code, or kick his butt to get him to
move and fix it.
Unintialized variables and bad compares may not be as trivial as they
appear.  Look closely at them to see if there isn't really a problem that
lies underneath.
Thanks,
-- Steve
