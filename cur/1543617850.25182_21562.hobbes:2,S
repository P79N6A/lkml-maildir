This is actually a long-standing UNIXism that is pretty heavily relied-
upon -- for example, opening a temporary file then unlinking it before
use "guarantees" that the file will not stick around in case the app
crashes before it can properly close and unlink.
One nasty side-effect is space allocation -- after unlinking a file and
writing to it, you can fill the disk without the file showing up in 'ls'
or 'du', etc.  Hard to debug.  Stronghold on Solaris used to do this
with log files -- HUP did not discard the old FDs.
