So if it is only similar - then a mapping would be needed to maintain
a link with the new kernel message naming model if userspace wants
to relate the message back to the kernel device it was related too.

Perhaps it is, although consist naming of system objects and messages
related to them as a policy sounds like a good one.
I see the argument of not making this depend on sysfs although it could
perhaps be argued both ways. Certainly using the sysfs kojects gives
you the consistent naming for free. You are making a similar policy
assumption by using netlink, that all users of event logging will want
want networking compiled in. Just as fs's depend on block devices,
so can system object related messages depend on *the* system object naming
and toplogy framework.

Perhaps these driver errors are most likely in the context of a system object
that would be registered with sysfs (drivers, device instances, buses, etc).
Which in your example is one such case.
I'm not saying it should be either way just that there are logical
benefits to having this dependancy. If not, it is a choice of duplication
of effort to name and/or maintain these seperate but "similar" to sysfs names.
The question you have to ask is - how many systems that use this will not
have sysfs compiled in? (ie. all 2.6 based desktop systems or any 2.6 embedded
device using hotplug and udev will have sysfs).
As I said it can be argued both ways and forgoing the depedancy on sysfs
may have other negative maintenance aspects of yet another naming scheme.
ie. does LANANA need to set up a registry for these?
just my 2c.
