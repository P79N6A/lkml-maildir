Most of these (in core code, anyway) seem to use yield when they really don't
care about running for a while.

This one should be pretty rare (actually I think it is dead code in practice,
due to the way the page allocator works).
Avoiding sched_yield is a really good idea outside realtime scheduling. Since
we have gone this far with the current semantics, I think it would be sad to
back down now.
It would be nice if you could pressure those other components to adapt :)
