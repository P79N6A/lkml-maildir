No, it works now as if it was 2.4.x series.
Now it just randomly hangs the system, ie. somewhere at the end of 
scanning or suchm no nothing in logs or similar. Simply hangs. My guess 
is that It shoudln't, no matter what, I always thought Linux was stable 
but the current problems (CDburning problems around 2.6.9, scanner/SCSI 
hanging the system) seem to  contradict this. That's bad.
