yes. the machine already routes correctly between the 2 subnets and
the internet which is on a seperate interface. i also disabled
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/send_redirects, to no avail.
the setup is so:
eth1: public IP
eth0: 192.168.0/24 and 192.168.3/24
routing table has correct entries, the 2 private subnets are routed
out thru dev eth0 with appropriate src. eventually i just installed a
seperate NIC for 192.168.3/24 and it worked as i expected it to.
however, i still need to know how to get linux 2.2 to do complete
forwarding of packets between different logical subnets that share
the same link.(i still have a couple more logical subnets that this
machine has to route).
So do i need a seperate NIC for each logical subnet? i'm sure i
don't, but i don't see what i'm supposed to do with the 'ip' command?
different scope or realm? or ... ??
