Hi guys,
I was using 2.3.43 (and all other recent 2.3.x) without observing this
specific problem so it is something new to 2.3.44. I have not narrowed
it down yet but the symptom is that I can't start any large programs
(e.g. X) and can't compile almost anything, gcc randomly dies with
SIGSEGV.
(No, please do not tell me that my 256M DIMM is broken - it was
running absolutely every 2.3.x just fine since the day I bought it).
The machine is a plain dual PIII (Katmai) 550 on a GA BXD motherboard,
nothing too exotic - old good slot 1 design.
I will let you know if I find more - I intend to narrow it down and
then look closer at the changes. The first look at 2.3.44 patch
reveals only numa changes (irrelevant) and the innocent change to
page_alloc.c (not counting my change to comment in vmscan.c,
of course :), so there is something non-trivial going on here.
Regards,
Tigran.
