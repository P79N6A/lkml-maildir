Well, unfortunately people seem to disagree about "what the right
softmac is". And James's code is in kernel, thats _huge_ advantage.

Another fact is that it is not in kernel, and by the time you get it
cleaned up, in-kernel code will probably get advanced enough that your
code will not be merged.
If devicescape is really so much better, submit it _now_. It may be
slightly buggy, but so is probably current code.
