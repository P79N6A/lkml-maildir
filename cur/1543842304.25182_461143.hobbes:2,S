I'm not convinced, I'm pretty sure they'd say something like "this 
appears to be an IRQ routing problem" and send it somewhere else. I saw 
a bug report (introduced by the recent mainline via_irq_quirk() changes) 
where exactly this happened, but I can't find it.

Where's the patch?
This report seems to be inconclusive. Your USB problem (comment #19) was 
clearly something to do with UHCI itself, whereas Stian's problem is 
much more generic and outside the control of the USB HCD: nobody cared
Plus the only issue related to IRQ routing on that bug is triggered by 
the closed nvidia driver...

Sorry, I can't figure out what you are trying to say here. Can you 
rephrase it?

I think you might be right here. Firstly IRQ 15 is a legacy IRQ, 
secondly the existing "&15" thing has no effect on IRQ 15 obviously.

No, there is no bug, think about the logic:
We bail out if dev->irq is higher than 15. Therefore when we get to the 
lines of code in question, dev->irq is 15 or less. Performing a logical 
AND operation with the value 15 (0xf) is going to have no effect at all.

I beg to differ. Usually APIC interrupts are level triggered. In fact 
(just as an example!) most NAPI-based network drivers will not work with 
edge-triggered interrupts. Additionally, if my understanding is correct, 
multiple devices sharing an edge triggered interrupt is bad news 
(interrupts likely to get lost so devices do not get serviced).
