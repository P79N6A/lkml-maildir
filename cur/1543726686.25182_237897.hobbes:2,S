basically each codepath has a typical latency distribution, and when a
workload uses multiple codepaths then the latencies get intermixed almost
linearly.

yep, that's a fair assumption. Once the IO-APIC irq-redirection problems
are solved i'll try to further thread the IDE completion IRQ to remove
that ~100 usecs latency.
