Hello
I'm looking for main differences between aic7xxx driver from kernel 2.4.9
and aic7xxx from kernel 2.4.18. With newer version of kernel there is a
message while system is started :
modprobe -k scsi_hostadapter errno=2
HINT : Try to change IRQ or IO settings (it sounds sth like this)
/lib/aic7xxx not found
With older version of kernel all is fine. I would like to add that scsi
driver is loading to kernel as module
Any hints?
regards
Mariusz Bozewicz
