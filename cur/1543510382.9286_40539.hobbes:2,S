   Checking that 2.3.x works reasonnably with low memory configuration is 
   indeed fine. But developping with so few memory looks like masochism 
   exacerbation. Are these core developpers also flogged, each time they 
   provide a bug? ;-)
To sort of answer your question, one of the low memory machines in
question is what stress tests our routing/ipv6 code (it is the router
for an entire university department).
You will note, that there are no missing checks for NULL returns from
kmalloc in the routing code as a byproduct of this :-)
