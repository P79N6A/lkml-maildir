This sounds like user confusion.
A partition becomes a Linux swap partition by writing "SWAPSPACE" somewhere
at the beginning. (Yes, I know the details, don't tell me.)
If this signature is missing, the kernel refuses to swap to
the partition, in order to protect your data in case of a typo
in the swapon command.
The signature is written by the mkswap(8) command. Use it.
