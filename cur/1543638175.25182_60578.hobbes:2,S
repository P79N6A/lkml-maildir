As I said, "one could get fancy", thus missing the 2.6.xx kernel.
It's pretty obvious that you could do SCSI and IP with much less
code. What's with the "HCA DDK" anyway, UDI reborn? I see all sorts
of layers for IPC and what looks like VI/VIA, etc.
Ditch the lofty goals, and you might make the 2.6.xx kernel.
You can stick to being a FireWire alternative for now.
