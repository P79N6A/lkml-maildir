Hrm... right, that ibmlcd bit can go ;) Hopefully someone else will
get the real ibmlcd driver in sooner or later...
My code wasn't really intended to deal with hot-removal, more with
"what happens if printk occurs during the Power Management suspend
sequence", but I tried to keep the notification mecanism simple
enough so it could be used for that as well. Also, indeed, the fbcon
changes should deal with hot-removal in some way (though you surely
also want to "deatch" from the fbdev's in this case).
Among other things that could be used for is live monitor insertion/
removal detection (some HW are able to do that), "pivot" monitor
kind of things, etc... typically via the mode_changed hook.
Ben.
