I don't know what you've done to accomplish it, but either your
modules got separated (e.g. libusual built statically while usb-storage
is dynamic), or your modprobe is toast, or 100 other reasons.
Just deconfigure CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB and CONFIG_USB_LIBUSUAL
and forget about it all.
I know, I have to think of a workaround for this, but nothing is
readily apparent.
