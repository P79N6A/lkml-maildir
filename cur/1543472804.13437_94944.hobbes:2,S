The USPO is protected by law -- they issue patents if you don't like
it, that's tough. You can't attack the USPO only patent holders and
people whom you claim are violating patents.
The USPO doesn't make the law, politicians do -- this is where the
problem needs to be addressed.
However, as we all know, most politicians are pretty dumb, so
explaining abstract concepts to them is doomed to fail and were
pretty much stuffed either way....
