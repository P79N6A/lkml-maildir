I don't mind switching back and forth between 32-bit and 64-bit for
plain kexec, especially if we can validate that the kernel we load
will use an instruction set that is supported. But for kdump,
switching between 32-bit and 64-bit kernels is just another new
dimension in the already too complex kdump matrix IMO.
I think more focus should be put on fixing up bugs in kexec-tools than
adding new features.
