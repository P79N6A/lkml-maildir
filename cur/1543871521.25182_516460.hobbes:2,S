Hello everyone.
IMHO, ACPI disabled due to DMI failure or blacklisted year should be
noted, as is done with other ACPI blacklisting.
This will help people troubleshoot when ACPI isn't working.  Status
quo is a mysterious "ACPI Disabled" message without explanation on
BIOS that implements ACPI but not DMI.  This is actually fairly common
on embedded x86 boards.
