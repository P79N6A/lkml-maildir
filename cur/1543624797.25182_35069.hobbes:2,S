There is no guarantee that UNIX bench is SMP-friendly, or even
designed to test an SMP machine. Single programs that make good use of
an SMP machine usually have to be designed very differently than a
traditional program designed for a single processor.
It is probably just luck that the numbers jump around.
Just because Unix bench performs better or worse, or not as better, on
an SMP machine, as a non-SMP machine, does not mean that the numbers
accurately effect the capabilities of a real-life application. Unless
specifically designed for the environment, it is even possible that the
numbers would not even come close.
