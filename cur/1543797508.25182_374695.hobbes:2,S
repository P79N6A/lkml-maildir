I have successfully done this using Debian/Sid.
1. I changed the linux/Makefile:
ARCH            ?= x86_64
CROSS_COMPILE   ?= x86_x64-linux-
2. The I changed the path to include the following /tmp/lin64/ directory:
PATH=/tmp/lin64:$PATH
3. I made a bunch of scripts as follows all in the /tmp/lin64/ directory:
x86_x64-linux-ar:
#!/bin/bash
ar $@
x86_x64-linux-gcc:
#!/bin/bash
has32=`echo "$@" | grep -- "-m32"`
if [ "$has32" = "" ] ; then
        gcc -m64 $@
else
        gcc $@
fi
x86_x64-linux-ld:
#!/bin/bash
ld -m64 $@
x86_x64-linux-nm:
#!/bin/bash
nm $@
x86_x64-linux-objcopy:
#!/bin/bash
objcopy $@
