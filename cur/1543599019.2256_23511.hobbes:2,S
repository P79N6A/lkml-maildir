Mr. Viro,
	OK. The existing API is wrong and the new min()/max() macros are the
right way to properly compare values. However, we could always add a config 
option to enable a compatibility macro, which would use typeof() on one of the 
two variables and then call the real min()/max(). Something like this (just an
example):
#ifdef CONFIG_ALLOW_COMPAT_MINMAX
#define proper_min(t, a, b)	((t)(a) < (t)(b) ? (a) : (b))
#define proper_max(t, a, b)	((t)(a) > (t)(b) ? (a) : (b))
#define min(a, b)		proper_min(typeof(a), a, b)
#define max(a, b)		proper_max(typeof(a), a, b)
#else
#define min(t, a, b)		((t)(a) < (t)(b) ? (a) : (b))
#define max(t, a, b)		((t)(a) < (t)(b) ? (a) : (b))
#endif
	Unfortunately, this would violate your idea that "hiding" the real
code behind compatibility stuff is C++esque, and, IYO, an Evil Thing(tm). That
just leaves me with one question to everybody: 	
	<rant type="question" intensity="30%">
	Why did Linus change this out of /dev/null and suddenly run off!?
	</rant>
