These things tend not to be discussed in specific detail in the processor
reference manuals. If there are exposures they are generally covered by
blanket statements about the need to ensure correct serialization between
processors when reading from, and writing to, the same location. As far as
I am aware Linux is protected from such affects because we do use locks, or
serializing instructions, to protect the updating of variables that are
accessed by multiple processors. My guess is that the exposure to
score-boarding, if it exists at all, tends to be limited to concurrent
bitwise operations.
