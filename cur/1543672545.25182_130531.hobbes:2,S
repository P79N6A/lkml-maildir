2.5.69-mm1 is fine, 2.5.69-mm2 panics after a while even under very
light load.
Machine: 2.4GHz Pentium IV UP,
network card: 3Com Corporation 3c905C-TX/TX-M [Tornado] (rev 78)
video: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon RV100 QY [Radeon 7000/VE]
Kernel config details:
UP, no module support, devfs, preempt, console on radeonfb
I got the OOPS this way:
boot normally (with X and network), switch to console
and log in, play nethack on the console until it oopses.
It will oops while in X too, but then there's nothing
visible to write down.
This is what I managed to write down. The first part scrolled
off screen with no scrollback - and no logfiles due to the
"not syncing" part:
