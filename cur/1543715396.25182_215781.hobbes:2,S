Aughr. 
Wouldn't it be much nicer to just refuse to overwrite files owned by 
anybody else?
In other words, I'd much rather see a patch that is a much simpler one, 
which just says: if we opened an existing file, we won't touch it if we 
weren't the owners of it.
That should be safe for root _and_ it should be safe for people who 
already had a file descriptor open previously (hey, if the previous 
root-owned core-file was world readable, then what else is new?)
Tell me why this isn't simpler?
