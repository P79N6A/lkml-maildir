hmm, just an idea, but have you thought about using
an indirect syscall table for your purposes?
 current->syscall_table 
and have a table for every 'mode' you want to use ...
or maybe have a 'mask' for every syscall (in a 
separate table) which describes the allowed 'modes'
just because checking the syscall number in a loop
doesn't look very scaleable to me ... 
best,
Herbert
