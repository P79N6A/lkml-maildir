CPL=3 scares me; context switches are expensive.  can they have direct
hardware access?  I'm sure a security model to isolate user mode drivers
could be in place. . .
. . . huh.  Xen seems to run Linux at CPL=3 and give direct hardware
access, so I guess user mode drivers are possible *shrug*.  Linux isn't
a microkernel though.

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
    wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
    new problems waiting out there.
