This could create confusion in the future.  It would fix the situation 
in 2.6.24 for the tea576x drivers, but would create bigger problems for 
the other tuner drivers.

Exactly,  except that tda9887 is an analog-only driver.  We CAN make 
TUNER_TDA9887 depend on VIDEO_TUNER, but it doesn't have to, for the 
same reasons described above.
We must _not_ make tda827x, tda8290, or mt20xx depend on VIDEO_TUNER.  
Same goes for tda18271, but that doesn't appear in the kernel until 2.6.25.

I agree, although we spoke about this on linux-dvb last year and people 
didn't like the idea.  However, now the situation is different, due to 
hybrid tuner refactoring.  I can put together an RFC and handle it on 
the v4l / dvb mailing lists, hopefully have something ready for the 
2.6.25 merge window.  ( Do I have at least a month's time before then? )

What we really need is to make the Kconfig selection behave as if it 
depends on VIDEO_TUNER, but only if VIDEO_TUNER is selected.  I know 
that sounds redundant, but that would actually solve the problem.
If VIDEO_TUNER is not selected, then the driver can be built as either Y 
or M,  If, however, VIDEO_TUNER is selected, then the driver must be 
built as whatever VIDEO_TUNER was selected as.
Roman, do you have any ideas?
If not, I think that the best thing that we can do for 2.6.24 is force 
the selection of the tuner sub-drivers, although I'm not even sure that 
it would fix the problem...
Toralf, can you try the following, and let us know if this works?  I 
haven't had time to test it myself, yet.
Edit the file:  linux/drivers/media/Kconfig
scroll down to "config VIDEO_TUNER"
remove the bit " if !VIDEO_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE" , such that the select lines 
will read:
        select TUNER_MT20XX
        select TUNER_TDA8290
        select TUNER_TEA5761
        select TUNER_TEA5767
        select TUNER_SIMPLE
        select TUNER_TDA9887
instead of:
        select TUNER_MT20XX if !VIDEO_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE
        select TUNER_TDA8290 if !VIDEO_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE
        select TUNER_TEA5761 if !VIDEO_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE
        select TUNER_TEA5767 if !VIDEO_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE
        select TUNER_SIMPLE if !VIDEO_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE
        select TUNER_TDA9887 if !VIDEO_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE
If this fixes the problem, then I think it would be a good temporary fix 
for 2.6.24, until we can make a better, more drastic fix for 2.6.25
Thanks for testing.

Mike Krufky
