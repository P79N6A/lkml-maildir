I have a UP system with Via kt266a chipset.  When I enable APIC in
the BIOS and in Linux, the system boots mostly normally, but I get
a fairly constant stream of
APIC error on CPU0: 02(02)
with a smattering of other numeric codes from time to time.  Most
things still work, but there are a number of oddities and instabilities,
most notably my integrated uhci USB controllers give usb bulk-msg
timeouts on every device.
This happens with 2.4.20 vanilla, 2.4.21-pre4-ac6, Debian's 2.4.18-bf24
and every other 2.4 series kernel I've tried... can somebody point me 
at a faq/patch/person to help get me started resolving this issue ?
Thanks in advance.
