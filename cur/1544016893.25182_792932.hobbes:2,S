Jan-Bernd may be able to tell you details about this, and send you the
driver code that his interns implemented for it.
This was only doing virtio_net between two machines using MMIO transfers,
i.e. the DMA engine was unused, but there was a mailbox interrupt (if you
have one of these, you won't need MSI, btw -- just write a DMA to it).
