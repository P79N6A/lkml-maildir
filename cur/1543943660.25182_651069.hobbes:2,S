Hi Sven,
This looks good to me, assuming that its tested and works.
A few minor things:
In sb_queue_tail() master loop is woken up if
the ip_vs_sync_count reaches 10, which seems a bit arbitary.
Perhaps its just my mail reader, but the patch seemed a bit screwy when
I saved it to a file. I this fixed the problem I was seeing using s/^  / /
Unfortuantely/Fortunately I am about to leave for a few days skiing,
so if I am quiet you will know why.
