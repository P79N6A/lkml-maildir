I try to give your patch a try on the ATI based MSI Megabook S270, today - 
however even with the workaround of "noapic" I had timer drift on resuem from 
ram if the cpu was scaled to a lower frequency when it was suspended.
The k8 cpufreq code failed to assert the current frequency and thus assumed a 
wrong one:
Restarting tasks...<3>powernow-k8: ignoring illegal change in lo freq table-0 
to 0x0
powernow-k8: transition frequency failed
 done
Also my ACPI table only has two frequency entries, 800000 and 1600000 MHz - I 
wonder if one could rework the powernow-k8 driver to interpolate values in 
between to get smoother adaption of the frequency?
Yours,
