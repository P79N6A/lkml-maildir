I've got an external 2.5" VAIO case (VAIO original yeah, right)  that
works ok what I can tell with USB2 on my laptop. Are the id:s below
the same as yours?

The 2.5" case also works with USB 1.1, but it is kind of funky. I
guess it requires lots of power. So much power that I have to use a
hub with external power to connect it to a winxp laptop. Connecting it
directly to the laptop does not work for some strange reason - MANY
other devices are powered directly from that laptop.
I recently realized that there are no firewire pccards on the market
today that can power my firewire-powered cd-burner without using an
external ac adapter. My Apple G4 Mac can power the darn thing over
firewire though. Maybe the same thing goes for USB2 host controllers
on pccard? Maybe you need an external ac adapter?
