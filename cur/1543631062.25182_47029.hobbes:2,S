Actually, getting  a notion of your sourcebase and what's actually
running sounds like a great idea. Any chance you could rattle off what
patches you've got and/or name the tree, and maybe send me a .config?
Also, any chance you could tell me a little about the hardware?
I'm not going to tell you what to run or not to run, I just want to
know where to start looking.

I don't know of any particular issues with gcc 2.95.3, but I'll compare
the disassemblies you sent me just in case.
Your help in tracking this down has been immense, I hope you have the
patience to bear with me as I try to fix this for you.
Thanks,
Bill
