Most of my work has been in the kernel and I had not paid attention to
user 'threads'. However, I have at the moment to a need to debug a
user 'pthread' based applicaiton, that I may want to move into the kernel.
However, I can't seem to figure out how to get GDB to debug my user
pthreads app. What is the correct setup to debug pthreads based applications
now that it seems that pthreads implementation generates processes/threads
in the kernel.
Thanks
John Clark
