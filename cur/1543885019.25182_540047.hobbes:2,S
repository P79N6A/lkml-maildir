I was cced on that as far as I can tell.
The name objsize suggests the size of the object not the slab size.
If you want this then maybe call it kmem_cache_slab_size. SLUB 
distinguishes between obj_size which is the size of the struct that is 
used and slab_size which is the size of the object after alignment, adding 
debug information etc etc. See also slabinfo.c for a way to calculate 
theses sizes from user space.
If we really drop SLAB then we wont need this. SLUBs data structures are 
not opaque.
