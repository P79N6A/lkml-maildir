This one doesn't keep the exact same behavior as before, as it is 
zeroing more memory than it did.
If this is not a performance critical path, then I guess it's ok (code 
size reduction, and all).
I just wanted to call some attention on this so that someone more 
knowledgeable than me in the bluetooth ways can make sure it's ok.
