Ok - here is some data that should put your mind at ease.  I pulled
the checksum functions from the kernel, stuck them in userland, and
ran each one N times at a variety of byte sizes (where N=10,000), took the
start and stop times with gettimeofday(), and added it all up.  The results
for the Geode LX platfrom are below.
I think the data shows that the ppro checksum is indeed useful on the
Geode LX platform (and the GX should have similar results, since the
pipelines are pretty close).  Unless I made a really boneheaded mistake
in my app, I think we should leave X86_USE_PPRO_CHECKSUM enabled for Geode
GX/LX.
