I don't know exactly why recursion is used to follow symlinks,
which at first thought seems like it could be iterated, but
I've not checked the code, there certainly are specific reasons
for this. However, there's often an alternative to recursion, it
consists in implementing a local stack onto the stack. I mean,
when you need recursion, it is because you want to be able to
get back to where you were previously (eg: try another branch
in a tree). Recursing through functions has a high cost in
terms of memory because many things get saved multiple times,
while you will often only need a few pointers and a recursion
level.
I have already implemented this in a few programs and it's very
easy, although I don't know how it would be with the symlink code :
foobar() {
  void *stack[MAXDEPTH];
  void *ptr;
  int  level;
  level = 0;
  ...
recurse:
  if (level >= MAXDEPTH)
    return -ELOOP;
  /* this level's work before the recursive call */
  ...
  ptr = some_useful_pointer();
  printf("before: ptr=%p, level=%d\n", ptr, level);
  ...
  if (need_to_recurse) {
    stack[level++] = ptr;
    goto recurse;
  }
after_return:
  /* this level's work after the return */
  ...
  printf("after: ptr=%p, level=%d\n", ptr, level);
  ...
  /* return to outer level */
  if (level > 0) {
    ptr = stack[--level];
    goto after_return;
  }
  ...
  /* end of the work for level 0 */
}
Saving paths components this way is easy too, with the full name copied
only once in memory, and with one byte per recursion level :
  char path[MAXPATHLEN];   /* <= 255 */
  __uint8_t pathlen[MAXDEPTH];
  char *path_end;
  path_end = path;
  ...
  snprintf(path_end, path+MAXPATHLEN-path_end, "foobar/");
  ...
  if (need_to_recurse) {
    pathlen[level++] = path_end - path;
    goto recurse;
  }
  ...
  /* return to outer level */
  if (level > 0) {
    path_end = path + pathlen[--level];
    *path_end = '\0';
    goto after_return;
  }

I've already encountered such setups in which I was worried that they
might break under some 2.6 kernels.

Probably because having both performance and maintainability often
implies a tradeoff between easy and ugly, and the maintainer's job
is to find the best tradeoff.
