Yes, kdump and kdb have a completely different philosophy. But it's natural,
because their duties are different.
I think kdb is a supplementary debug means. kdump is not perfect, because
hardware sometimes breaks down. The probability that hardware (HDD, HBA, memory,
etc...) breaks down is very low, but it is not zero. If kdump fails taking a
dump, kdb data (process status, backtrace, log buffer, etc...) is very useful to
analyze the panic reason. kdb data is very poor in comparison with kdump, but
better than nothing.
So I request a favor of you again, please do something about this problem.

I think there is no technical reason. But panic code will be dirty if every
kernel developers adds their own hook. I think this is a reason why kdb uses
panic_notifier.
