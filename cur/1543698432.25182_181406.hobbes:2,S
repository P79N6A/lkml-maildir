Thanks,
I found the problem. I do have errno.h included. I was doing a read of errno
after calling perror. If I read it directly after getting the neagtive 0ne
back, it contains the right value.

Because you forgot a "#include <errno.h>"? Or you have something else
wrong in your program that makes "errno" mean the wrong thing?
