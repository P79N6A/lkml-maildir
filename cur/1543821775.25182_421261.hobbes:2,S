I'm all in favor of cleaning up X.  But making the X code prettier without
changing the underlying issues of claiming and sharing resources doesn't
help much.  In fact, I suspect the ultimate plan for X does not involve
an "enable" attribute in sysfs, so this may just introduce ABI cruft that
will be difficult to remove later.

This seems to be the main justification for the patch.  But I don't know
enough about X and DRM to understand it, or why this patch is the best
way to solve it.
I think Jon has a pretty convincing argument, which I *do* understand.
Can you expand on this justification?  Do you envision long-term usage
of the sysfs "enable" attribute?
