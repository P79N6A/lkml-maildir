	Hi, everyone!
	This is my second try to backport AGP 3.0 to 2.4 tree. This backport adds 
generic AGP 3.0 routines and VIA chipset specific routines. 
	All code is based upon Dave's code for 2.5.64, and it now respects coding 
style used in 2.4 tree, so no more stupid includes, makefile changes, etc.
	There is support only for VIA KT400 chipset, at the moment. When I find intel 
mobo to test, I'll try to add support for intel too.
	Works fine with XFree 4.2.0 and 4.3.0.
