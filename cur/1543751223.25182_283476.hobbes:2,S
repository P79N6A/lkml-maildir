I think what Andrea is worried about is that blk_congestion_wait is
fairly vague, and can be a source of instability in the scanning
implementation.
For example, if you have a heavy IO workload that is saturating your
disks, blk_congestion_wait may do the right thing and sleep until
they become uncongested and writeout can continue.
But at 2:00 am, when your backup job is trickling writes into another
block device, blk_congestion_wait returns much earlier, and before
many pages have been cleaned.
Bad example? Yeah maybe, but I think this is what Andrea is getting
at. Would it be a problem to replace those blk_congestion_waits with
unconditional io_schedule_timeout()s? That would be the dumb-but-more
-deterministic solution.
