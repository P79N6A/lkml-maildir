In recent 2.6.12 prereleases a bug has appeared. Whenever I log out of 
KDE, IRQ 11 is disabled on X server restart (kdm restarts it). It always 
results with the dmesg below and sometimes the new X loses keyboard 
input (ps2 keyboard, usb mouse). USB mouse works well. X works (sans 
keyboard sometimes). Network is dead.
irq 11: nobody cared!

Disabling IRQ #11
Celeron 900, Intel ICH2 chipset with integrated UHCI and onboard e100 
NIC, running Debian unstable with XFree 4.3. 2.6.12-rc2 + XFree of that 
time was OK, didn't try rc3 and rc4, rc5 probably also not tested but 
rc5+git snapshots are the broken ones (together with current XFree). ATI 
rage128 graphics with DRI enabled; I get the following dmesg lines on 
X server start and at least the agpgart lines on each X server restart 
too. I have seen this bug some time earlier too, probably in 2.6.11 
timeframe, or in early 2.6.12 timeframe.
