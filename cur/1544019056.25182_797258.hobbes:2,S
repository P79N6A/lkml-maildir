Returning SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY is the right thing and such problem
should not happen.

Handling one outstanding command is must. If you can't, the system
can deadlock in OOM.
If you put the deadlock issue aside, the above host->can_queue issue
is irrelevant. Even if you set host->can_queue to 1, scsi-ml sends one
command to the LLD again and again until it succeeds, I think. As long
as the LLD can send a command occasionally, the system works.

Tying swiotlb resource the whole time is unlikely. Everyone uses it
temporarily.

Maybe the reporter doesn't copy enough to hit the deadlock.
If you need 512MB swiotlb buffer, surely it's something wrong. The
kernel should work smoothly with much less (even if it works slowly).
