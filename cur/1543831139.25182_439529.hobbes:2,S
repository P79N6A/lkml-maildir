I never liked this patch.  The last time it came up there were
conflicting answers about whether it was a code generation bug or a
real issue talking to hardware or what.  At the least I think this
merits a big comment explain what's going on -- and even better would
be really understanding the bug that's being fixed so that we're
confident it is indeed a real fix.
