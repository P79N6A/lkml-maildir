Actually, __builtin_clz:

Not having a gcc 2.4 handy, I couldn't test it, but I did notice that the 
built-in ffs is very fast.  Perhaps all such standard functions will end up 
as built-ins instead of kernel library functions, some very long time in the 
future.  If old compilers ever do finally fade away, that is.
It's somewhat annoying that __builtin_clz leaves the all-ones case dangling 
instead of returning -1.
