To update you all:
Last night Adam and I were debugging the PnP and Adam squashed two bugs.
The Sound driver WORKS however, there are serious IRQ/DMA conflicts
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
sb: Init: Starting Probe...
pnp: the card driver 'OSS SndBlstr' has been registered
pnp: pnp: match found with the PnP card '01:01' and the driver 'OSS SndBlstr'
pnp: dma 0
pnp: dma 1
pnp: res: the device '01:01.00' has been activated.
sb: PnP: Found Card Named = "Creative SB32 PnP", Card PnP id = CTL0048, Device PnP id = CTL0031
sb: PnP:      Detected at: io=0x220, irq=5, dma=1, dma16=5
sb: Interrupt test on IRQ5 failed - Probable IRQ conflict
<Sound Blaster 16 (4.13)> at 0x220 irq 5 dma 1,5
sb: Turning on MPU
<Sound Blaster 16> at 0x330 irq 5
sb: Init: Done

2.5 uses TWO irqs for the i8042 2.4 didn't which gives me 0 irq's free.
The problem is, the ISA Modem wants to use IRQ 5
So i have multiple conflicts at the same time ;-(
