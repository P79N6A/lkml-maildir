The numbering is not important, and yes, it will change between merges 
etc. BK doesn't actually use the numbers for anything internally, the ID's 
for changesets are the cset "keys".
What is important (and what BK checks) is that the _parent_ has to exist 
(and that's checked through the key, not through any numbering).

This particular BK changeset may have applied - a number of your earlier 
ones did not. I stopped testing (for example, your _first_ bk patch in the 
first ALSA merge _did_ apply, but the second patch did not - because it 
depended on other changes you had done outside of ALSA, in particular 
apparently you had merged code from the trivial patch tree)

I'm more than willing to do that - that's how I do most of my BK merges by
far (I used to have to accept the JFS merges as emailed BK patches,
because IBM had these strange export rules, but that's been fixed for the
last month or two already).
But I can only do that if the tree is clean - ie there aren't "random"
changes there. Ie no BK merges with other people, no non-ALSA patches etc.  
I know you've had some of those, since I've seen the effects of it through
non/applying patches, and through the fact that you obviously had the
DECLARE_BITMAP() change in your tree, even though it wasn't in mine (ie
the result of applying your patches as patches didn't actually compile
without modifications).
But if there is a clean tree to pull from, that is absolutely the 
preferred method for me to sync up, _especially_ with things like drivers. 
Then an email that just says
	Linus,
	  please do
		bk pull .....
	to receive changes to the following files
	.. diffstat list ..
	through the following changes
	 .. changset list ..
and then I don't even need to see the diffs themselves if I can just see
that it only touches the ALSA files (that's another reason why I really
want clean trees - immediately that there is a changeset to a non-ALSA
file I want to see diffs, so that I have a clue about potential conflicts)
