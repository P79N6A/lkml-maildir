Hi,
I've finally got around to test latest kernels and managed to find a bug in 
the serial subsystem, which happens during suspend.
I use a 3Com PC Card Bluetooth adapter that needs serial_cs and hci_uart
modules. Whenever I try to suspend using 2.6.10 or a newer kernel, the
following bug appears. Note that 2.6.9 works perfectly.
#v+ handwritten, 2.6.11-rc5
