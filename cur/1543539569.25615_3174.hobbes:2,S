	Agree 100%. 
	And on the topic of root/moot/etc every third if not every second workstation 
installation out there has some of the hdXX or sdXX with permissions that 
alllow non-root to mess with them. Reasons are numerous - CR rippers, CD 
writers, CD players, etc...
	First: you can blow up you firmware on CD devices as well. Happily. Quite a 
lot of them support flashing and firmware updates.
	Second: All the above programs do what? Execute tons of ioctls... and/or mess 
at low level. So if they blow up and pass bogus data before dying miserably...
	So if the kernel can check some stuff with no serious performance penalty it 
should do so.
	IMHO: 
	Andre should take a few days at the seaside or fishing or whatever his 
favourite means of non-computer related holiday are. He explodes instantly at 
the moment. There is no such thing as a programmer or sysadmin with a life 
(see man sysadmin on alt.sysadmin.recovery) but we need to get some life from 
time to time as well.
