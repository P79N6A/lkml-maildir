Because all of these video quirks are just workarounds for the fact that 
the kernel doesn't work properly. In general, you really don't want to 
call a real-mode video bios from the kernel, so punting it to userspace 
(and leaving the whitelisting there) is somewhat more straightforward. 
In addition, we can then extend the whitelist without requiring kernel 
upgrades.

We've got i915 suspend/resume now, which already fixes this for a large 
number of users. Recent ATI is easy, now that we actually have specs for 
ATOM. The nouveau guys are almost at the point where we can do it for 
nvidia. That basically just leaves VIA.
The other s2r issues are pretty much just driver bugs at this point.
