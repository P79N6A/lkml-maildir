Subject: [PATCH][PPC32] Optimize/fix timer_interrupt loop
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/9/168

The following patch fixes the situation where the loop condition could
generate a next_dec of zero while exiting the loop.  This is suboptimal
on Classic PPC because it forces another interrupt to occur and
reenter the handler. It is fatal on Book E cores, because their
decrementer is stopped when writing a zero (Classic interrupts on
a 0->-1 transition, Book E interrupts on a 1->0 transition). Instead,
stay in the loop on a next_dec==0.
