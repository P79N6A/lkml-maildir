Speaking of aliasing, 2.3.x has had a problem for a while where 'ls -l'
will show _two_ directory entries for a single file.  This is a
temporary problem which always corrects itself 5-10 seconds later -- and
'ls -l' looks normal after that.
So far this has happened to me only for normal files recently
copied/manipulated, and only on NFS filesystem.  That last data point
may be a red herring though, as my environment is very heavily NFS'd
anyway.
This has been around for quite a while in 2.3.x, and I have never seen
the behavior in 2.2.x.  I reported this once before a while back, but
since the problem always goes away it was never a big deal.
Regards,
	Jeff
