Subject: [GIT PULL] FireWire updates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/25/232

Linus, please pull from the for-linus branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git for-linus
to receive the following updates for the firewire and the ieee1394
subsystems.  This queue consists of fixes developed between end of
January and February 20.  Therefore several of these updates were not
yet visible in -mm.  But all of them showed up in -next (behind planned
post 2.6.25 stuff), most of them AFAIK also in Fedora test kernels.
The queue improves the SBP-2 driver's reliability during device
recognition and during bus topology changes.
All patches have been seen on LKML and linux1394-devel but I will follow
up with the combined full log and diff.  Diffstat and shortlog:
