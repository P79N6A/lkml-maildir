Nope. And you could do the following (pseudocode!):
   script = open("scriptfile", O_RDONLY);
   check_and_set_caps(sprintf("/proc/self/%d", script));
   execl("interpreter", sprintf("/proc/self/%d", script), any, others)
No race.

Better start today then. BTW, I'd say months is closer to the truth.

And putting them into the file doesn't have this very same problem?

That is a misfeature, as it allows smuggling capabilities.

Nope.
