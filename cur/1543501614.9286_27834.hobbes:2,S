    It's possible to specify optional argument to interpreter in script:
    -- cut --
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    -- cut --
    but not possible to specify two arguments
    -- cut --
    #!/usr/bin/eperl -B=<!--eperl -E=-->
    -- cut --
    Why ? It's very annoying :-(( What POSIX says on subject ?
Why?
It is like this: if you have a script called bar, that starts with
	#!/some/patch/foo lots of arguments
and the script is invoked using
	/some/other/path/bar
then the program /some/patch/foo is called with precisely three arguments:
	0: "foo"
	1: "lots of arguments"
	2: "/some/other/path/bar"
In other words: a space does not separate arguments here.
See also fs/binfmt_script.c.
POSIX? 
	"Some systems can exec shell scripts. This functionality
	 is outside the scope of this document."
