As Bruce stated, this is an igb issue, not e1000e.  From your boot.log:
igb: eth0 NIC Link is Up 1000 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: RX/TX
igb: eth0 NIC Link is Up 1000 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: RX/TX
One other piece of info (in addition to what Bruce requested) that would 
be useful is after you've done ifconfig eht0 up, cat /proc/interrupts | 
grep eth0 and send that output (I want to see your MSI-X configuration).
