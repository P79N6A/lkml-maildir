OK.  2.3.12 does this:
...
Freeing unused kernel memory: 40K freed
attempt to access beyond end of device
03:41: rw=0, want=1811967860, limit=1179328
attempt to access beyond end of device
...
I get four of the "attempt to access" messages and the 03:41: line after
each one of them, a little different each time.
It's right where it's trying to execve /sbin/init.
BTW, it only reports "attempt to access" if I build the kernel with
egcs-2.91.66 (the one that came with RedHat 6.0).  With gcc-2.95, it hangs
in the same place, just silently.
Regards,
Brad
