You need to let go of the model that driver that drives hardware also
do the device discovery and it will all fall into place. While it may
be contained in the same source module it is 2 different code chunks
(for the lack of the better word) and we should not mix them together.

Unfortunately it breaks manual driver binding/unbinding through sysfs
so I don't think it is a good long-term solution.
