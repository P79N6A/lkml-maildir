You can't use gzip if you want it to talk to other modems.  Duuuh.

Not really.  I havn't seen a Portmaster or a telco switch that emulates
modems that runs Linux yet.  The most common use of a modem at this point
in time is to talk to an ISP, and most real ISPs aren't using Linux to
talk to their modems -- they're using specialized hardware.  They're
probably not using winmodems either.
