btw, just looking at the filemap_sync_pte() code for MS_INVALIDATE, I
noticed
	if (!PageReserved(page) &&
	    (ptep_clear_flush_dirty(vma, address, ptep) ||
	     page_test_and_clear_dirty(page)))
		set_page_dirty(page);
I just happened to follow the function and noticed that on s390,
page_test_and_clear_dirty() has the comment:
* Test and clear dirty bit in storage key.
* We can't clear the changed bit atomically. This is a potential
* race against modification of the referenced bit. This function
* should therefore only be called if it is not mapped in any
* address space.
but in this case the page is clearly mapped in the caller's address
space, else we wouldn't have reached this.
Is this a problem?
