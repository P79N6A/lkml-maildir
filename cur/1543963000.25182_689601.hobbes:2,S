(Thanks for the review, Christoph)
Agreed completely, but vfs_* aren't for filesystems to call, rather
for entities calling _into_ filesystems from the outside.  This is
actually a very rare thing, so adding some extra logic for the sake of
cleanliness should be OK.
Now it can be argued, that cgroup_clone() is calling into the
filesystem from the outside.  But it's not really doing that, rather
it's making an internal modification to a specific filesystem,
triggered by some external action.
