I'm surprised there's much of a problem here.  It is a 32-bit value, so it
should mainly be a matter of treating the return value from
percpu_counter_read() as unsigned long.
However a stickier problem is when dealing with a filesystem which has,
say, 0xffff_ff00 blocks.  Because percpu counters are approximate, and a
counter which really has a value of 0xffff_feee might return 0x00000123. 
What do we do then?
Of course the simple option is to nuke the percpu counters in ext3 and use
atomic_long_t (which is signed, so appropriate treat-it-as-unsigned code
would be needed).  I doubt if the percpu counters in ext3 are gaining us
much.
