First 2.5 kernel to build out of the box and run. I haven't tried all the
drivers I can actually use, but at least the base system builds and runs
without patches.
I have a response time benchmark which shows that all 2.5 kernels have a
problem with response time under heavy write/swap load, but I don't have
the docs written for the test, so I probably shouldn't post results from
it ;-) In any case, nice job on this one!
