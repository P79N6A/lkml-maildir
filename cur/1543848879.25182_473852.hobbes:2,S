I guess the correct way to handle it will be to put a "used" attribute in the
asm-generic/marker.h code, remove the unnecessary "unused" attribute in
asm-powerpc/marker.h and tell people to upgrade their gcc when it is broken.
The other way around would be to make the macro "use" the structure somewhere
without any impact.
