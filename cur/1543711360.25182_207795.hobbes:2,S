Probably what happened is that the file was created earlier, and now JFS
can't read it now.  The default behavior for JFS recently changed from
using CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT for the iocharset, to doing no translation
(which is equivalent to iso8859-1).

You should be able to mount it with iocharset=iso8859-2.  The kernel
prints the utf8 message, since utf8 will allow you to access any
character.  It doesn't know what charset was used to create the file
originally.

If you intend to use iso8859-2 characters, you can always mount with
iocharset=iso8859-2.  Otherwise, you shouldn't see any new files created
that jfs can't access.
