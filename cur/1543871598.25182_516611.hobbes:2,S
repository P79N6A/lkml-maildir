I was not planning to touch anything but epoll, signalfd and timerfd 
files.

Currently, they use a single inode, and multiple dentries (to give the 
name of the class). But this could be changed to a single dentry like 
Linus was suggesting. I'll wait for Al's reply before doing anything.
Memory saving can be something, on top of the already big one of avoiding 
code duplication.
