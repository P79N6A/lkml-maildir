Hi
Just a question in between (while I am making my own first steps with
RedHat):
What about the symlinks in /boot to vmlinuz-2.2.5-15 and
System.map-2.2.5-15?
Did you remove them? If not, I think they won't be overwritten by "make
bzlilo". And I had to edit /usr/src/linux/Makefile to make installpath
/boot work (I got the sources from www.kernel.org).
Have also a closer look to /etc/lilo.conf - kernel which will be loaded
is vmlinuz-2.2.5-15 and not vmlinuz (which is normally done).
