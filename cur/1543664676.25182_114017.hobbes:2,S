I did consider it, I just don't think it's a good idea.

Agreed, but in a project to develop the best possible version control
system for the Linux kernel [1], I don't see how compatibility with
any other version control system is of any interest at all.
It's only if you want to use several version control systems in
parallel that it might be an issue, but if a single, free, version
control system is in use, I don't see why that would be necessary.
Getting the data out of Bit Keeper and in to a different version
control system is a one-time job, and as far as I am aware there is
no difficulty getting data out of a Bit Keeper repository, (using Bit
Keeper itself), in a suitable format.
[1] As distinct from projects to develop the best possible version
control system in general or to develop a GPLed project to complete
with Bit Keeper.
John.
