Good lord would you calm down.
Run the rescan-scan-scsi.sh script floating around. Out own website
describes having to use this for 2.4 kernels. It was either leave sbp2
oopsing, or rewrite the load logic so that there was no way for left
over scsi cruft. The side affect is that the only hot-plug situation
ieee1394 had in 2.4 is gone.
Before, loading sbp2 before loading ohci1394 gave the same affect. Now,
loading sbp2 before ohci1394 also requires running rescan-scan-scsi.sh.
Blame the scsi layer, not me.
