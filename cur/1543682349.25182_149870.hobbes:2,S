Thanks fot hint'n'offer!
Basically, cvsps sucks off the rlog messages and compares any check-in
texts / times of any files to find out what has been checked-in with a
single check-in. That is then called a patchset (cvs_ps_). With some
command line arguments, it'll then output the check-in text as well as a
unified diff.
This information can then be used to feed it to other SCMs or for simple
review tasks. While doing consistency checks, I discivered the mentioned
inconsistency (at patchset 11504 IIRC) as well as some minor glitches (I
had one patchset where the check-in comment changed after I re-fetched
the patchset some days later...).
However, I'm working at spare time on it, so it'll take some time:(
