Hi all!
We are now pleased to announce the release of Umbrella version 0.4.1, 
which
really boosts performance of Umbrella =:-D
Umbrella implements a combination of process based mandatory access
control and authentication of files.
(more information on 
http://umbrella.sf.net
)
The major changes include the following:
* Name refactoring in the code:
   "Additional child restrictions" is now called level2/l2 and
   "Restrictions" is now called level1/l1
* A global hash table has been implemented, to store the indexes of the
   static level1 restrictions. This boosts performance dramatically, as
   this was done by tons of string compares in earlier versions :)
* The syscalls works for UML once again
* The level 1 and level 2 hash functionality have been put into seperate
   files, namely umb_hash_l1.c and umb_hash_l2.c
Umbrella 0.4.1 can be downloaded from SourceForge here:

Enjoy,
Kristian.
