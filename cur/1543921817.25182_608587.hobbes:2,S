That's good to hear :-)
I have a series of pending patches where I've collected fallout patches
from people and some from myself here:
http://git.kernel.dk/?p=linux-2.6-block.git;a=shortlog;h=sg
or pullable from
git://git.kernel.dk/inux-2.6-block.git sg
As far as I can tell, all archs should now compile and work. I've tested
(compile tested) alpha/arm/ia64/m68k/mips/sh/sparc this morning and
fixed whatever showed up. It's all just a missing linux/scatterlist.h
include or ->page usage.
