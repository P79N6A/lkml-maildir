Hi,
Is the following really intentional?
vmscan.c:122:
        flush_cache_page(vma, address);
        if (!pte_dirty(pte))
                goto drop_pte;
	...
        flush_cache_page(vma, address);
        if (page->mapping) {
Nothing accesses the actual page between the two flush_cache_page() calls,
the first one was added in test13-pre5.  Should test13-pre5 have removed
the second instance?
