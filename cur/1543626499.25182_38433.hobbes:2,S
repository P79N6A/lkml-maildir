Subject: [PATCH] simple preemption debug check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
This simple check was first suggested by Andrew Morton.  Pretty basic -
whines if a task exits with a nonzero preempt_count value.
I put an identical check in the 2.4 preempt-kernel patch and - sure
enough - it was found that XFS essentially disables preemption as it
destroys data structures containing locks without first unlocking.  The
SGI folks are working on that.
Anyhow, its a quick and clean solution to debugging potential problems. 
Patch is against 2.5.7, please apply.
