The pcmia makefile utilised vpath, the last makefile in 2.5.42 according to
a fast grep.
The following patch made it compile for me, but there were warnings about cli
and friends, so you will not be able to do the final link.
I simply added "../" in front of qlogicfas.o - but this is my opinion not
the final solution for this so I did not sumbit it for inclusion.
Kai - if this is ok, could you include it in next round.
tz@execpc.com also copied - seems to be qlogicfas interested.
