Alan,
In the case of failed mirror group (a group of mirrored segments that
has a segment out of sync that requires user intervention) we need to do
this.  At present, we are simply removing/adding mirrors without asking
the user.  Novell used to use this method, but customers continually
asked for the ability to make decisions about re-adding failed mirrors
that may come back (it may have been a config error instead of a device
failure, or the RAID array box may have had a unit switched off by
accident when the server booted.  A user may also be removing mirrored
devices for archive purposes).  
Basically, knowing what these customers already expect, we are reacting
to it before Linux gets to "re-learn" what Novell already knows.  There
are many circumstances where the OS needs to be able to ask the user for
a decision about whether a mirrored device should be ignored or re-added
to the mirror group.  The distributed cases with mutiple mirrors (we
support up to eight) has split-brain cases to deal with.  Out Interface
handles all these wierd cases by simply asking users as to whether a
mirror group will be allowed to go active if any of the mirrors have
come back or gone away during system boot, or whether mirrored segments
that have reappeared should come back.  
We also support an automatic mode that just fails out the mirrors and
activates incomplete groups.  There can be problems of permanent data
loss in cases where a primary mirror failed, a secondary was elected,
the secondary failed, and now the primary comes back, and the other
mirrors for some reason were remirroring and not all updated (assumes
more than two).  In such a case, we will inactivate the mirror group
until we get a human to tell us which segments to coalesce into a mirror
group.  We can also do it automatically, and make the best fit choice,
but there could be data loss if the scenario described above happens.
