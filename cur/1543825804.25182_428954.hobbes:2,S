How can I obtain (2^30)*6 bytes of truly random bytes?

I've run it with following source ip/port selection algo:
	if (++sport == 0) {
		saddr++;
		sport++;
	}
Starting IP was 1.1.1.1 and sport was 1.
Destination IP and port are the same 192.168.0.1:80
Jenkins hash started to show different behaviour:
it does not have previous artefacts, but instead it's dispersion is
_much_ wider than in XOR case.
With following ip/port selection algo:
	if (++sport == 0) {
		//saddr++;
		sport += 123;
	}
I see yet another jenkins artefacts, but again different from previous
two.
But each time both folded and not folded hashes behave exactly the same.

What should be used as starting point there?
If I use 0 it is the same as jhash_2words().
If I use 123123 - artefacts are the same, just slighly shifted (I tested
only the latest test above though).
Looking into the code we can see that jhash_2words() is jhash_3words()
with zero "C" value, so it will show the same nature.
