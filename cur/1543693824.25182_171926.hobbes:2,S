| Consider the patch at the bottom of this message instead.  The tosh_get_info

Yes, your patch is good and should be applied.

| Cool.

Good, thanks for the info.

| Toshiba patch:

| # This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
| # Project Name: Linux kernel tree
| # This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
| # This patch includes the following deltas:
| #	           ChangeSet	1.1344  -> 1.1345
| #	include/linux/toshiba.h	1.3     -> 1.4
| #	drivers/char/toshiba.c	1.11    -> 1.12
| #
| # The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
| # --------------------------------------------
| # 03/10/10	noah@caltech.edu	1.1345
| # Remove the prototypes for tosh_get_info from include/linux/toshiba.h and
| # make the function's definition in drivers/char/toshiba.c static.  This
| # function is specific to toshiba.c, so no other file needs the prototype.
| #
| # This allows drivers/char/toshiba.c to compile with CONFIG_PROC_FS=n and
| # allows one to link more than one driver that includes toshiba.h into the
| # kernel at the same time without a multiple declaration; for example, both
| # drivers/char/toshiba.c and drivers/video/neofb.c.
