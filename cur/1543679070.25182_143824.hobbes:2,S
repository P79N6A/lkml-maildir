I don't care if you completely ignore the bugzilla, just let the
rest of us lesser mortals use it.  There's always the chance we
will find something we can fix and actually lessen your load.

Forcing people to continue to retransmit the same report just pisses
people off, and in the end will get you less useful reports than if
you had flagged the report as 'please-gimme-more-info'.  And, most people,
especially the savvy ones, will find some sort of work-around and keep going.
That didn't fix the problem, it just made it invisible again untill the
next person hits it.

Perhaps, but it's also possible that you are being a stubborn SOB
because you fear change :)
