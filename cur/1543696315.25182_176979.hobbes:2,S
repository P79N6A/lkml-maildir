Subject: Re: Shared ACPI/USB IRQ working in 2.6 but not in 2.4

The details of this issue are here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1283
Looks like the IOAPIC is in a different state in 2.4 and 2.6 before ACPI
programs it.  Also 2.6 has sis_apic_bug code that 2.4 does not -- though
I don't know yet if it actually runs on this box.
cheers,
