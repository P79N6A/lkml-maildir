So the generic part of the code should behave like this:
  if (info->fbops->fb_blank && info->fbops->fb_blank(blank_flag)) {
      /* use hardware blanking */
  } else if (info->fix.visual == FB_VISUAL_PSEUDOCOLOR ||
	     info->fix.visual == FB_VISUAL_DIRECTCOLOR) {
      /* use software blanking */
  } else {
      /* no blanking possible, except for filling the screen with black, which
	 is not appropriate (unless we save/restore the contents?) */
  }
Is that OK for you?
