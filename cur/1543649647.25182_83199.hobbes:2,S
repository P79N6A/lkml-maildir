Please repeat the test using a tarball created from a reiserfs 
partition, you'll get better numbers for reiserfs.  Not as good as 
reiser4, but still much better than these.
File order from readdir matters a lot.
It is a bit amazing how many obscurities can bite you with seemingly 
simple tests like this.  We recently ran into one with tar recognizing 
that it was writing to /dev/null, and optimizing for it.
