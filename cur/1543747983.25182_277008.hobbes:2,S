1. The correct value is 5 days for the case of long idle connections, 
there are such things, and there is no reason to force such connections 
to do keepalive every 100 seconds to stay alive.
2. You can change it in your firewall in 
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established
