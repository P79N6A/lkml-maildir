The hacker, obviously being root, could also write a module that tries to
disable the whole MD5 checking thing. He could also mess up everything by
dumping crap to /proc/kcore, without the MD5 thingie.
He could also remove the insmod for the module from the startup scripts,
provocate a reboot...
If one's already root, the system is overtaken. There's always a way if you
are root.
I even would say that if a hacker got root privileges, there's no more need
to replace any binaries. (except for building "entry insurances")
But if he has no complete root shell, and there is a way to somehow
change a binary, put in a trojan horse (how many times a day is an
administrator typing "ls" as root?)... well, that's bad. And the signed exec
module (it's called "signed exec" since I later plan to implement some
public/private key mechanism) prevents this.
It does not prevent an idiot system administrator from doing idiot things
which break security, but maybe it has some advantages.
I believe that security is mostly a conceptual thing, built up by a good
admin with a good network structure. But if we can make a operating system
a little bit more secure, make hacking just a little bit more harder -
why shouldn't we do so?
Just my 2 cents,
Julien
