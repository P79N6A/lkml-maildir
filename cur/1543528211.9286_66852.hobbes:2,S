Subject: 2.2.14: recvfrom() bug or feature?

I'm tracking down a possible bug in RH6.1 routed daemon. It does a
	recvfrom(fd, &inbuf, sizeof (inbuf), 0, &from, &fromlen)
and it appears that even when `from' is cleared in advance the from->sa_data
contains not only a 2 byte port number + source IP but also some trailing
garbage afterwards as it seems to me. Is this a bug or a feature?
Example data:
(gdb) p fromlen
$4 = 16
(gdb) p from   
$5 = {sa_family = 2, sa_data = "\002\bÁ°\231@\000 üÁ %pÂ"}
This roughly translates to:
	\002\b	= 520 (source port: route service)
	Á°\231@	= 193.176.153.64 (source IP: ppp1 peer)
and the remaining 8 bytes are a mistery and seem to block proper operation of
routed (expects zeroes instead when matching it with interface addresses):
hex	00 20 fc  c1  7c  25 70  c2
dec	0  32 252 193 124 37 112 194
