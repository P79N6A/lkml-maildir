Are suspend and suspend2 not calling kernel_power_off()?
I am not certain about that code path but I worked hard in the lead
up to 2.6.13 to get everyone on the same page so we did not have
strange reboot issues on one code path and not on another.
It is possible that the code path in suspend is so strange I did not
recognize it.  How do you initiate a S4 power off?
I can understand suspend2 having problems as it isn't merged but suspend
is merged isn't it?
Hmm.  Looking at that bug report it specifies 2.6.11.  Does this
problem really happen in 2.6.13?
