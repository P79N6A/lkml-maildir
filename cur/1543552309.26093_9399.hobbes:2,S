This code:
	iv.it_interval.tv_sec = 0;
	iv.it_interval.tv_usec = 250000;
	iv.it_value = iv.it_interval;
got miscompiled as:
	iv.it_value = iv.it_interval; /* read random */
	iv.it_interval.tv_sec = 0;
	iv.it_interval.tv_usec = 250000;
That is an obvious compiler bug. None legal optimization can allow the compiler
to do such reordering (not even with strict aliasing enabled).
