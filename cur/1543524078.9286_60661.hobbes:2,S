Hi
I discovered that installing kernel 2.3.40 partly broke things like asload 
and top. Asload gets ugly when the system is under heavy load (for example 
playing quake  :), and top tells me:
CPU states:  3.9% user,  3.9% system, 192.0% nice, 848707.7% idle
top seems to work again when I kill setiathome (running at nice 19 in the
above example.
Versions of (probably) relevant packages:
oysteivi@hex:~$ ps --version;procinfo -v;pstree -V
procps version 2.0.2
This is procinfo version 16 (1998-12-31)
pstree from psmisc version 18
System: AMD K6-2 300/128MB RAM
Is this fixed in 2.3.41 or in a newer version of one of the packages
mentioned above? (I would of course be happy to contribute more
information if anyone might want it).
