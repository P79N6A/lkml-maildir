Classzones used to be a superset of the memory zones, so
if you have memory zones A, B and C you'd have classzone
Ac consisting of memory zone A, classzone Bc = {A + B}
and Cc = {A + B + C}.
This gives obvious problems for NUMA, suppose you have 4
nodes with zones 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A,
4B and 4C.  Putting together classzones for these isn't
quite obvious and memory balancing will be complex ;)
Of course, nobody knows the exact definitions of classzones
in the new 2.4 VM since it's completely undocumented; lets
hope Andrea will document his code or we'll see a repeat of
the development chaos we had with the 2.2 VM...
cheers,
Rik
