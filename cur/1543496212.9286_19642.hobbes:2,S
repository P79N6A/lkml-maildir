You can try my 5.1.16 patch and see if that helps.  It adds several new
device IDs that I have never personally seen but were at least made
(like the UW Pro I think).  If that doesn't do the trick, then get me
the device_id and vendor_id out of /proc/pci and I can get it working
with a few lines of patch.
