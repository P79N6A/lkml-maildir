Btw, to tie this back to the other IDE thread, namely the suspend/resume 
thing, I think things like that should also just push commands down the 
request list. In particular, instead of waiting until the handler is NULL, 
it should do something like
 - create a "sync" request
 - do the equivalent of
	DECLARE_COMPLETION(wait);
	rq->waiting = &wait;
	q->elevator.elevator_add_req_fn(q, rq, queue_head);
	wait_for_completion(&wait);
which automatically synchronizes with any outstanding requests (simply 
by virtue of the elevator knowing not to re-order/merge special requests, 
so when the sync command in finished, we know all other commands have 
finished too).
Note that this should be the same code as for a shutdown as well - we
should finish with a flush buffers request and wait for it to have
completed.
I'd like a _lot_ of stuff to stop using "do_xxx_command()", and move toa 
higher layer so that more code can be shared between different subsystems 
(all of these "sync" issues are really completely generic, and should 
_not_ be duplicated across drivers or subsystems).
