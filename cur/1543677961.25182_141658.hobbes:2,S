Hi All
I have another test case that is showing this behavior.
It is very similar to George's, however, it is a simplification
of another one using threads that a co-worker, Adam Li found
a few days ago.
Parent (FIFO 5) forks child that sets itself to FIFO 4 and 
busy loops, then it sleeps five seconds and kills the child. 
Doing SysRq + T after a while shows the parent'd call trace 
to be at sys_rt_sigaction+0xd1, that is just inside the final 
copy_to_user() in signal.c:sys_rt_sigaction().
Reprioritizing events/0 to FIFO 5+ fixes the inversion. 
If I call nanosleep directly (with system() instead of
glibc's sleep(), so I avoid all the rt_sig calls),
I get the parent process always stuck in work_resched+0x5,
in entry.S:work_resched, just after the call to the
scheduler - however, I cannot trace what is happening
inside the scheduler.
My point here is: I am trying to trace where this program
is making use of workqueues inside of the kernel, and I
can find none. The only place where I need to look some
more is inside the timer code, but in a quick glance,
it seems it is not being used, so why is it affected by
the reprioritization of the events/0 thread? George, can
you help me here?
kernel is 2.5.67, SMP and PREEMPT with maxcpus=1; tomorrow
I will try .72 ...
