 What is the "gdt body must be addressable from real mode" requirement
about?  GDT is addressed by the CPU using a linear address as obtained
from GDTR (bypassing segmentation, for obvious reasons) and is accessible
regardless of its placement within the 32-bit linear address space in all
CPU modes.  As its a linear address it only undergoes translation at the
page level, if enabled.  The same applies to IDT.
