While I voted to remove smp nice till this regression is fixed can I just 
point out a mildly amusing catch 22 in this. Nice levels are _broken_ on smp 
without smp nice, yet it's only by using nice levels that you get this 
performance problem. I'm not arguing for changing our decision based on this.
