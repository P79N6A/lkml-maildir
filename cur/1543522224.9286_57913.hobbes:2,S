Actually, it doesn't change anything in the common case, except that ALL 
fragments would be sent out in reverse order.  I've not taken a close look 
at the IP code in 2.3.39 yet, but what I saw in 2.0.34 would REMOVE code 
because of the duplication of effort and REMOVE CPU cycles because it's far 
easier to debug and optimize one implementation than three.
I'm also not talking about adding a memcopy operation, either.
Perhaps this discussion should wait until I've had a chance to put together 
my change and submit it to the group for consideration.
