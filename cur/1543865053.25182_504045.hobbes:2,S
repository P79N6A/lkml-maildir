It would be better to let the application set it without root rights 
(afaik W. allows this).  Auto tuning beats explicit configuration anytime.
Not sure it's really worth it though.
My thinking was to gather more requirements of what users actually
want first before adding all these new modi.

zmailer used to do that (or probably still does) but I always hated
the scheme for some reason :)

Good point. Even on desktop with Multi Core or SMT it should be cheaper now.
