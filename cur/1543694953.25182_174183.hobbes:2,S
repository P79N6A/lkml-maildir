Well here I've got same problems for -test8 + fbdev-patch as with -test8-mm1. 
I've compiled the kernel with most DEBUG_* options enabled (all but 
DEBUG_INFO and KGDB) and see the same cursor and image corruption as with 
-mm1 and the same options enabled.
Should I try compiling this kernel without the DEBUG_* options and watch if I 
get the invalidate_list Oops again?
I use vesafb on a Nvidia GeForce 2 MX 440 with 64MB Video-RAM.
