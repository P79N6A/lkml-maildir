Sounds nice indeed.
Do you think we could try to use 4Mo pages instead of 4Ko to map some
libraries/executables ?
libc.so could be linked to align text to a 4Mo boundary, and to set a an ELF
marker to tell the kernel/loader to try to use
HugeTLB page to map the text portion. The space wasted (the current glibc
use about 2Mo instead of 4Mo) is neglictable if the same page is used for
all processes in the machine...
HPUX11 has a chattr command that can mark binaries to use BigPages (for text
pages or data pages). We could 'mark' big programs with an ELF attribute to
ask for the behavior you describe (force the load of all the mapped portion
at mmap time) or/and to try to use HugeTLBPages...
