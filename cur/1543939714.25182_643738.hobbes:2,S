I was waiting for someone to ask ;-)
Yes, I'm getting a document ready for the Documentation directory. I was
just making sure the interface was fine befor publishing the doc.
Actually, the patches themselves have been showing the API in the
prologue, and that's what I'll be using for the doc. All is done except
for the new histograms. The format for those was taken directly from the
-rt patch, and I still need to document them, but I've been hesitent,
because I want to clean up the histogram code a bit more.
