============
Radiotap headers make sense for an rfmon virtual device.  I don't
think it makes sense for "normal" usage.  Should there be an option
for radiotap headers on non-rfmon links?
Rfmon interferes w/ other interfaces, but may be handy to enter/leave
w/ little effort.  Perhaps a config option for physical device to
suspend/resume all (non-rfmon) virtual devices before/after enabling
rfmon virtual device?  (Would multiple rfmon devices even make sense?
If not, is it worth restricting that?)
What about old hardware w/ inactive maintenance?  Deprecate/remove?
Grandfather them w/ treatment as ethernet devices?  Probably don't
need a pronouncement on this at this time...
