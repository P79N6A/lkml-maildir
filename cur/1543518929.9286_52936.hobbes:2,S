I really like that.

All of these share a serious problem: they depend on userspace code to  
initialize the userspace-kernel interface.
That means you need a _different_ userspace-kernel interface just so these  
solutions can be made to work.
This is madness.
Now, you could go around this by having the kernel put default code there  
that's exchanged during boot - but it still seems to me it's far better to  
just have the kernel do the right thing from the start.
