Hello,
I have just made ide.2.2.21.01152002-Ole patch:
o       backport from ide.2.4.16.12102001.patch: pdc202xx.c - ver 0.30
                - no 48-bit lba - this requires changes in other files:
                   ide-disk.c, ide.c, ide.h, ... Maybe in future...
o       fix missing DEVID_MR_IDE definition in ide-pci.c for VIA_82C576_1
o       add PROMISE_20268R, PROMISE_20269, PROMISE_20275 in ide-pci.c
o       add CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE option into Config.in, ide-pci.c
BTW: why the pdc202xx.c file still has "Version 0.30    Mar. 18, 2000"?
It has been changed since that time! :)
After all this changes, pdc202xx.c driver still works for my PDC20265 :)
So, if there is no problem with ide.2.4.16.12102001 my patch should also
works, maybe even for 20268R, 20269 and 20275 chipsets. ;-)
Best regards,
