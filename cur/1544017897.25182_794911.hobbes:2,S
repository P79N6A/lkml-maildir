This only seems to occur under KVM, right? I.e. you tested it with -no-kvm 
and the problem went away, correct?
This suggests some sort of KVM-specific problem. Scheduler latencies in 
the seconds that occur under normal load situations are noticed and 
reported quickly - and there are no such open regressions currently.
Avi, can you reproduce these latencies? A possibly theory would be some 
sort of guest wakeup problem/race triggered by a shift in 
preemption/scheduling patterns. Or something related to preempt-notifiers 
(which KVM is using). A genuine scheduler bug is in the cards too, but the 
KVM-only angle of this bug gives it a low probability.
