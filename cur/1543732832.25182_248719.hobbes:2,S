You're missing the point.  We don't need transparency in all apps.  You
can write an application to be as transparent as you want, but you don't
need every app to to understand every file format.

I don't do much image editting, but I'm sure there are applications that
let you edit the description in a text file.  You can even create a
script that extracts it, runs nano, and puts it back into the jpeg.
This works for me:
tar -tf file.tar | grep '\.doc'
There are userland tools that deal with hundreds of file formats.  Use
the tool you need, rather than try to have the kernel do everything.

Just choose the right program.  tar groks tar files, not ls.
