Thanks for this info Lee, and understand I don't hold anybody specifically in 
the alsa team responsible but *deep breath*:
Please let everybody know about incompatible changes to alsa-lib know about it 
prior to making the change mandatory.
This means immediately update 
http://www.alsa-project.org/
 with the 
information. I do not mean add a one-liner to the changelog.
ALSA's great and I wholeheartedly support it, but this sort of thing cannot 
happen without informing people about the requirement. Expecting people to 
"just upgrade" is frankly not acceptable. At all. We're not using Rawhide.
