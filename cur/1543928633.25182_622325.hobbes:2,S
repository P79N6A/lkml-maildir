Um, cough cough (I ready do have a nasty cold) SELinux supports
a very limited bit of chaining. I don't think you're going to be
chaining security_secid_to_secctx() or security_secctx_to_secid()
with the current SELinux code, but you could prove me wrong there.
Chaining is a red herring. If you want talpa it seems that you
have a use case that isn't going to require the presence of
another LSM. You may have other issues, but at this point I say
throw caution to the wind, clean it up based on the suggestions
you've seen here, and put the patch up as an RFC on the LSM list.
What's the worst that could happen?
