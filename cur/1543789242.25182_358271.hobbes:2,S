Even a write barrier is required on the left side, the read barrier on
the right side is useless if there is no write barrier on the left side.
Note that the barrier in atomic_add_negative is useless here because it
happens way too late, _after_ the count is decremented (not _before_)
so the decreased count could be already visible to the other cpu.
Not all archs are like x86 where a barrier happens implicitly both
before and after the instruction, and the way atomic_add_negative is
implemented the barrier from a common code point of view is only added
_after_ the instruction.
