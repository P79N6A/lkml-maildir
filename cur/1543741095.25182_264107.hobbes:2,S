And how do you define a maintainer?  That's a moving target.  Part of the
beauty of the Linux development model is that mini forks are not only
allowed, they are encouraged.  So people can go off on their own and do
something interesting.  Who knows?  One of those people could be the next
Alan.

Sure.  But even so it's a moving target and labeling a set of people as 
maintainers implies that other people aren't.  I suspect Linus isn't 
that interested in the labels, he'll take good code from anyone.
