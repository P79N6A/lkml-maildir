No friggin way. Point here is that if eople are given the option to
write kernel code in C++ then they *will* do it ant worse someone
*will* start using thew broken parts of C++ in the kernel. So what
happens, someone starts doing that and we start getting bug reports on
this ... now who is to maintain all this crap? Is it reasonable to
waste the kernel developers' time on problem reports with people not
understanding what they are doing with C++? It's like having to deal
with problem reports on people compiling their kernels with things
like pgcc just a lot worse.
True one can write a kernel module in C++ *if* you're really careful,
but major chunk of programmers out there are not. The only way to
avoid this huge can of worms is to totally deprecate it.

No it's an issue of maintainabillity raised by the people who have
been maintaining the bulk of the code for years.
