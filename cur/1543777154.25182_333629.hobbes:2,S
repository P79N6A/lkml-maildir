Well we have always mounted our cyrus filesystems with:
noatime,nodiratime,notail
And the problem was occuring all the time with these mount options. We've 
since also added on your suggestion nolargeio=1 and used the patch Vladimir 
created. I'm not sure which of those fixed the problem, but it definitely 
has not occured since we did those last 2 things.
Are you saying that if you mount with noatime *and* use your new patch it 
will fix the problem?
What about the 2 threads linked to. Did those end up getting anywhere?
