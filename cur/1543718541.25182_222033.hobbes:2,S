May as well cc lkml on this.  It's to do with the disk write barrier
implementation.
- How do I know that the barrier code is actually doing stuff?  It doesn't
  seem to affect benchmarks much, if at all.
- Does reiserfs support `mount -o remount,barrier=flush'? and "=none"?
- How do I test the "oh, barriers aren't working" fallback code in ext3?
- Does the kernel tell you if your disk doesn't supoprt barriers?  ie:
  how does the user know if it's working or not?
