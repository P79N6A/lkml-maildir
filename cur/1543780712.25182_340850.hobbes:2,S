Well, but the other alternative is that we hit arbitrary BUG_ON() limits
in systems that create numbered workqueues which is rather contrary to
our scaleability objectives, isn't it?
I think I'd rather the name truncation than have to respond to kernel
BUG()'s.  If someone really has a problem with the appearance of ps,
they can always increase TASK_COMM_LEN.

What I posted originally; the current SCSI format for a workqueue:
scsi_wq_%d hits the bug after the host number rises to 100, which has
been seen by some enterprise person with > 100 HBAs.
The reason for this name is that the error handler thread is called
scsi_eh_%d; so we could rename all our threads to avoid this, but one
day someone will come along with a huge enough machine to hit whatever
limit we squeeze it down to.
