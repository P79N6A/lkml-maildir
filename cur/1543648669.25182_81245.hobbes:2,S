   first: i`ve successfully ran 2.5.43 on a 386sx20/4M ram notebook.
 the one problem was the ppp over serial not working, but i suspect
 that it just needs to be recompiled with 2.5 headers (am i right?).
 the other was, well, the fact that ultra-stripped 2.5.43
 still used 200k more memory than 2.4.19, and thats despite it was
 compiled with -Os instead of -O2.
 actually it was 2000k free with 2.4 vs 1800k  free with 2.5
 i know Rik had plans of some ultra bloody embedded/lowmem
 changes for such cases. i`d like to hear about things in the area :)
