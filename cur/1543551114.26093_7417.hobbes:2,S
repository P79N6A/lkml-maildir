I looked at that FTP earlier, but the patches where a bit outdated, and
the full source scared me off due to lack of understaning on how the
kernel links files together (I tried, didn't compile ;).
However, using the tekram patch for debian 2.2 (I remembered that deb
2.2 used a 2.2.17 pre kernel, so it would probably apply on a clean
2.2.17). It's up now, in 2.2.17, just in FAST-40 WIDE SCSI (80.0
MB/s) mode. It will do untill I get time to get 2.2.18pre running. My
disks aint that fast anyhow ;-)
Thanks, 2.2.18pre is on the way down the pipe.
