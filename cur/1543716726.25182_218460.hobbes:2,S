From memory 2 uses resources that code profiling tools need to use so
if you can use 1 then you can have your watchdog and profile too.

It should be OK, but those with mobos that get clock skew on pin 0 would
then demand a clock skew fix for their noisy hardware. I don't have a
motherboard with skew problems.
Personally I think that the clock system should be made immune to noise
generated timer interrupts just as it has been coded to detect missing
timer interrupts. I am pretty sure on nforce2 athlon mobos the tsc is used
in detecting missing pulses. Kind of like a digital phase locked loop? so
should it not also debounce the interrupts given that the ioapic interrupt
hardware cannot?

Obviously the pc hardware design is flawed in this respect.
Anyone know how to modify the existing timer tsc code to do this? And
offer to do it? Any brand/type of mobo is open to clock speed up due
to this effect, so I think it should be fixed, debouncing is fundamental
to input transitions that need to be counted.
