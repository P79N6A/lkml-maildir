I had the same problem also with an MasterView KVM and intellimouse.
They seem to have some problems in the mouse protocol implementation
in the switch.
The mouse can be identified through the KVM as a Intellimouse, but when
actually talking later some bytes get dropped. It actually said on the
wrapping that it should work with Intellimouse, but I think they
lied (or Windows uses some different way to initialise the mouse that 
works)
Boot with psmouse_noext, that should fix it. It runs the intellimouse as a 
plain PS/2 mouse. You lose the additional mouse buttons and the scroll wheel, 
but they never worked through that KVM anyways.
