That is a definite change then for sure.

Yes, they are kind enough to supply you with the address of the
code that will allow them to sell you a UPS.  What they don't
tell you was that they threatened Andre with legal action for his
code, which caused a BIG rift on this mailing list last year
(Oct-Nov 98).  Despite the company trying to squash Andre's
program, they surely didn't mind making money off selling UPS's
and pointing out Andre's program's existence.
Finally after much discussion with APC, etc... Andre released the
code back under GPL basically to "call their bluff" around April
7th I believe.  They realized they had no legal footing and as
far as I know they just shut up.
They are NOT a Linux friendly company however - despite what they
may say on the phone.  They'll say whatever you want to hear if
you'll buy one of their products.

Mine didn't because Andre's program would not work on my system
for some reason, and he could not give me the source code because
he was threatened by APC basically.  It put both him, and myself
in a bind for a brief period of time as GPL was involved, and I'm
a GNU advocate and a GPL advocate.  Things all worked out in the
end for me and Andre, and the program as well.  However APC has
left a bad taste in my mouth, and the mouths of many who followed
the thread.  You should be able to find it on deja.com easily
enough...

Well, I agree, however I put more stock into companies that say
"Yes, we support Linux" or "Here is the source code for a driver
for our product, you can do whatever you need to do to get it to
work in Linux", or "here is a manual, and we will not sue you",
or "NDA?  No, you don't have to sign an NDA, what do you think we
are?  APCC?"  ;o)

Agreed!
Take care,
