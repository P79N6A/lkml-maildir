Nice work...
However it's a pity all the balancing stuff got wildly changed
in 2.6.23 and then somewhat changed back again now.
Despite appearances, a lot of those things weren't actually
*completely* arbitrary values. I fear that it will make finding
performance regressions harder than it should have...
Anyway.
