(Yes, you are right. The bad binary driver just makes it more visible.)
With untainted kernel, I was able to make xmms skip simply by switching virtual
desktops quickly enough.
When ksoftirqd was reniced to zero, it seems to perform fine (at "2" setting).
I would like to ask whether I should do this. Or is it just the other way round
- renicing the ksoftirqd thread "kills" the effect of deferred processing?
Thanks.
Rudo.
