This is not a test and set operation.
On i386:
atomic_t atomic_exchange (atomic_t i, atomic_t *v)
{
   asm volatile("xchgl %0,%1" : "+m" (*v), "+r" (i));
   return i;
}

There is no way to do this (without waiting and trying again type
code) that I know of on i386.  However, you can test for zeroness of
the result, or for <= 0, or a few other options.
int test_and_add (atomic_t i, atomic_t *v)
{
  char was_nonzero;	/* MUST BE CHAR!!! */
  asm volatile("lock; addl %2,%0; setz %1"
    : "+m" (*v), "=rm" (was_nonzero)
    : "g" (i));
  return was_nonzero;
}
