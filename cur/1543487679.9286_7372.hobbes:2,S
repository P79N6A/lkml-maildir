while i was changing some things in my bios, i saw 
"Boot Up NumLock Status  : On" and i was wondering why Linux turns it off.
i know you can turn it back on with setleds, but the point is: if the bios
states it is On (and the bios acts accordingly) why does Linux turn it off
?
is this on purpose ?
