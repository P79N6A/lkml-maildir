I have taken a look at the DOSemu stuff, but the emulator in there 
was designed to emulator x86 code on x86 platforms (it has lots of 
inline assembler). The Willows code originally was intended to run 
anywhere, but the DOSemu stuff does not. Apparantly Willows is back 
porting some of the changes back into their code base.
The DOSemu emulator was not much use for what I wanted it for, 
because it depends on way too much other stuff to be useful. x86emu 
is very clean, modular and can be built easily as a stand alone 
emulator just to provide real mode BIOS access to protected mode 
programs on any processor platform. However it is a very powerful 
emulator (quite well designed IMHO), and with the changes I have made 
it is also quite fast. Some people have said that perhaps this 
emulator could be extended to support 32-bit flat model code (quite 
easy given the added 32-bit instructions now included), and could be 
used for the DOSemu project and also perhaps the GDB emulator for x86 
processors.
I think the value of a completely stand alone x86 emulator that is 
not tied to any particular project is extremely powerful.
