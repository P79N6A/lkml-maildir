I don't want to merge the flags the and the mode argument. It's ugly.

I really don't understand why you insist on renaming all my functions? 
I like the current naming, thank you.

I disagree on that. This would break programs that are first tested
on a small machine and then later run on a big machine (common case)

Messing with other process' VM is a recipe for disaster. There 
used to be tons of exploitable races in /proc/pid/mem, I don't want to repeat that.
Adding pid to set_mem_policy would be a bit easier, but it would require
to add a lock to the task struct for this. Currently it is nice and lockless
because it relies on the fact that only the current process can change 
its own policy. I prefer to keep it lockless, because that keeps the memory 
allocation fast paths faster.

mprotect() does the EINVAL check on unalignment. I think it's better
to follow mprotect here.
