That's their problem then. Or rather their users.
IMHO a maintainer's responsibility ends at kernel.org.
From a technical point of view the firmware needs to be
in ram when you resume from sleep. If you don't care about
updating it, having it in the kernel image uses somewhat less
resources. So I'd say go for it.
