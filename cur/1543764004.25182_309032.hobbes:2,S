so it seems that this is usb-serial specific at the moment. Then I would
propose to add it to the core of the usb-serial driver. Unless no other
driver in the kernel needs a IHEX parser, I think it is bad idea to mess
it up at the moment. People are also working on a replacement for the
current request_firmware(), because the needs are changing. Try to keep
it close with the usb-serial for now.

Marcel
