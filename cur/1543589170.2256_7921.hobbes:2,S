Hi Alan,
Hi linux-kernel,
I just saw, that cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr gives negative values
for the second part.
559     -211555
or 
174805  -3
I'm using 2.4.3-ac13.
I see this both on SMP and non-SMP, HIGHMEM and non-HIGHMEM, if
that matters.
The first value for the second example (SMP+HIGHMEM machine) also
seems a bit large...
exact .config or more data available, if needed.
Otherwise this kernel is very stable for me, and it feels really
good in interactive performance. 
Regards
Ingo Oeser
