Modern busses can tell which hardware is currently connected without
speculatively loading drivers. PCMCIA, USB, and PCI are examples. I
thought that modern devices connecting to the parallel port supported
that too, but I might be wrong of course.

It could be created at device detection time -- that is right after
the device is connected.

You just populate it with the devices from /proc/bus/*.
