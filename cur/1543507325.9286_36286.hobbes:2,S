	Yes, although not *quite* what you were expecting when writing
	to this forum...
	You need RMON or SNMP support at the network devices, and then
	monitoring software doing polling of the devices at regular
	intervals, and then counting deltas in between successive polls.
	One of much used free SNMP based monitoring/plotting tool is MRTG.
