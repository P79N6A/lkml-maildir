Hello,
We have a 2.4.26 system, just installed.  In top, I see the value for
buffers permanently at 4k.  The cached value often is up in hundreds of
megabytes, but buffers stays at 4k constantly.
This seems bad, and I'm wondering why it's doing this and how it could
be fixed.
Hardware is a HP/Compaq Proliant ML350 G3 server with dual P4 Xeon CPUs
and 2GB RAM.
Thanks,
John
