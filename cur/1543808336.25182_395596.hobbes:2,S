Hi 
I have been following this thread for quite a while, would just like to
point out that you are quick pedantic about accuracy.  
so even though it might be a bit of a pain to create a file called
/dev/hd*, I believe with mknod you could assign this name to any device
you wanted to or even symlink it to any device so you could use you
/dev/hd* the same way as you used /dev/sda etc
