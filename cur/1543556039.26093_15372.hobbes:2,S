Alone, it is not.

Oh, bullshit. We break the C standard left and right already.
This is the kernel, and the kernel can initialize BSS any damn
way it feels like initializing it. The kernel isn't ever going
to be standard C.
Choosing an initializer that tends to catch unintended reliance
on zeroed data would be good. Too bad it is too late to fix.

Go back and read the rest of this thread. Examples have been
provided (not by me) of such code leading to latter mistakes.
