Ugh, you should at least be checking if you've built the kernel with the
same config options :-) Of course, if you did a simple "make oldconfig"
but still lost some config options, then that's definitely a regression...
(was that the case here, btw?)

Well, DM_CRYPT /is/ a device-mapper target first. "Cryptographic options"
is for _actual_ crypto code, such as algorithm implementations etc. Users
such as encrypting file systems / IPsec / dm-crypt are better off at their
logical places, I'd say.
