I ran into this the other day myself and when I investigated the kernel 
code, I found that writes to /dev/random do accept the data into the 
entropy pool, but do NOT update the entropy estimate.  In order to do 
that, you have to use a root only ioctl to add the data and update the 
estimate.  I am not sure why this is, or if there is a tool already 
written somewhere to use this ioctl, maybe someone else can comment?
