Sorry for this late respond
Is sound/oss/emu10k1/ really ready to be replaced? According to a friend 
of mine, who got the hardware, the ALSA still lacks feature provided by 
the OSS-driver. He mentioned some sort of programmable memory (forgot 
the name for that) with whom you can run small programs to manipulate 
the sounds (adding echo and such). Also, he got problems with getting 
more accurate control of the volume (guess this is more a userland issue).
He seems to have done his homework but only got to pages where other 
peoples had the same problem.
If this is really implemented, please let me know so I can forward it to 
him. Also, any good site on ALSA with detailed information on this stuff 
would be much appreciated!
Thanks and good night
