I created such elf.h file and placed it into /usr/include under Cygwin in Z:
It works (the problem is solved) - so consider it to be tested now !
Thanks to everyone for help !
Best Regards,

PS But the compilation did not complete, the next error is:
make[3]: *** No rule to make target
 `net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_ecn.o', needed by `net/ipv4/netfilter/built-in.o'.
Stop.
make[2]: *** [net/ipv4/netfilter] Error 2
make[1]: *** [net/ipv4] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
