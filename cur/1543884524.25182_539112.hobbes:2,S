I didn't know that this was the plan.
The problem I have with this is that once we've merged one part, we're
committed to merging the other parts even though we haven't seen them yet.
What happens if there's a revolt over the next set of patches?  Do we
remove the core markers patches again?  We end up in a cant-go-forward,
cant-go-backward situation.
I thought the existing code was useful as-is for several projects, without
requiring additional patching to core kernel.  If such additional patching
_is_ needed to make the markers code useful then I agree that we should
continue to buffer the markers code in -mm until the
use-markers-for-something patches have been eyeballed.
In which case we have:
