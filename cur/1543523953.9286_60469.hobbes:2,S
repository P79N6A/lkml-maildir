With this stress-test you could have hit the problem
window in __get_free_pages(). Could you try 2.2.15pre5
+ my boobytrap2 patch?  That one should probably work
and if it doesn't it'll give us the error messages we
need to track down the bug for you and make sure that
the next kernel version will be stable.
