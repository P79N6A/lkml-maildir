- FreeBSD will display kernel print messages with syslogd not running, and 
linux will not.
- FreeBSD doesnt (seem) to have the buffering problem that linux does, in 
that exceptionally long messages (like decoding a Frame Relay LMI frame 
with 1000 elements) work just fine.
-  FreeBSD will display messages immediately without a newline
- FreeBSD messages 1) can be redirected and 2) are printed without a timestamp.
which implies that you are wrong about just about everything.

We are talking about the kernel. What are you talking about? The external 
view is meaningless.
the device driver interface changed substantially in 2.0. The module 
interface changed, as it is changing again in 2.4. The PCI interface has 
changed and is changing again.

Usually my customers want to upgrade because of some security fix or bug 
fix, not to get new features.

The eepro100 driver is an ongoing project, still with lockup problems. the 
tulip has issues as well.

Right. So your answer is that linux is OK if you modify all of the broken 
stuff yourself. Im glad we are in agreement on that, if nothing else.
