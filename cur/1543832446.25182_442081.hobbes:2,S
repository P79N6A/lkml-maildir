:-)  I love your logic...  Can I quote you on this?
Your thinking: "We don't know the future, until it happens",
leaves you unprepared for that future when it actually happens.

Impeccable logic, wouldn't you say?
How would you know that there will _not_ be any users unless you
give them the opportunity to use it?
Your logic is not only the chicken-and-the-egg problem but is also
the classical example in political history:
   Since there are no current users of "facility X", don't give
   it to the people.
How would you know?  How?  When it is not available in the first place?
I know subsystems' developers go through _great_ strives to keep
the kernel thread names to fit 15+1 chars.*  This is why you don't
see any "users".
If TASK_COMM_LEN _were_ 19+1 chars, I bet you users of that facility
will spring up.

* At least that was the case for me 6 years ago when developing iSCSI
code... Those iSCSI threads can certainly make use of something larger
than 15+1 chars.  And it's not only iSCSI.  You have to keep an
 _open mind_ to the future.
