Subject: LVM and lilo: a problem!

I am using LVM for a couple of weeks.
No functional problems at all.
However, I needed to run lilo and got the
following message:
Warning: '/proc/partitions' does not match '/dev' directory structure.
    Name change: '/dev/dm-0' -> '/dev/VSDB/gtpalma'
'/dev/VSDB/gtpalma' is a logical volume I created and is
working fine anyway.
What does this mean?
Should I do anything to avoid the message?
Thanks.
