Well I stared at these diffs for a long time.  They don't really add a lot
of value to the kernel and they do risk breaking other people's patches. 
Generally they have a high hassle/value ratio.
I could merge them up and see how it goes, but given that there are many
more kmem_cache_t->struct kmem_cache conversions to go, and that I hit
seven rejects in mm/slab.c, I think I'll duck the patches, sorry.

See the inconsistent coding style there?  This would have been a zero-cost
opportunity to fix that up.  (Nuke the space after the asterisk).
