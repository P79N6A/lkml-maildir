With my patchset I don't believe there is any ambiguity in how nodes are 
numbered anymore.
The node remap is suppressed on policy rebind if MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES is 
passed by the user either on mbind() or set_mempolicy()[*].  So in that 
case, the user is always referring to absolte physical node numbers; 
without the flag, the user is referring to relative node numbers since it 
can be remapped when the mempolicy context changes.
 [*] Or with tmpfs by appending '=static' to the policy mode at mount
     time.

That's a good question; when I prepared this patchset I simply based it 
off Linus' latest git + V3 of Lee's contextualize_policy() patch that was 
posted to LKML on February 8:

Lee has talked about another patchset that he hasn't posted (at least not 
lately) based on Mel's two zonelist work.  I'm not sure of that status of 
that right now and since Lee is idle this week I would recommend applying 
V3 of his patch plus my five (there was a fifth patch posted in response 
to KOSAKI Motohiro's findings of a mpol_new() memory leak:

Sounds good.
