Yeah, I thought about that possibility too, but the struct didn't need
that (in my opinion ugly) annotation before. Oh well, here you go.

Commit 89ec4c238e7a3d7e660291f3f1a8181381baad77 introduced a discrepancy
between the struct screen_info which is used by the C code, and the
PARAM_* offsets which are used in the real-mode kernel. As hpa suggests,
adding __attribute__((packed)) to the struct fixes it.
