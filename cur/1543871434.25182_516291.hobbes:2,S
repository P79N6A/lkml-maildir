Just a few comments on changes like this in general. Prompted by, but 
not otherwise related to the subject.
When any new feature in the kernel requires significant changes in 
userspace, attention should be given to documenting the user items which 
must change. Now "attention" doesn't mean handwaving b.s. like "user 
programs which depend on sysfs will need to be modified." It means a 
list of which common user features need to be updated and where to find 
new ones. That's what the whole Documentation directory is for, but it's 
rarely used for such a purpose.
In the most recent case, a user tool is needed which doesn't even exist 
as a release.
The other issue is to avoid "trap door" changes, which occur when a 
kernel change requires new user tools, and the user tools will not run 
with older kernels. That includes missing major features like having a 
display and being able to mount filesystems, even if the kernel is 
technically running. When there were stable and development kernel 
series that was not so much of an issue, now that every kernel is an 
adventure it would be nice to ensure that testing a new kernel is not an 
irrevocable step.
