Hmmm, it seems that the matter is so complicated that even you don't know what's
going on ;-)  The latest issue of Debian Weekly News explicitly mentions that
cdrecord has to go to non-free unless the license additions get changed.
> Let me comment what SuSE is currently doing with cdrtools:
You accuse Linux distributors of being non-cooperative, but I think that the
major cause of not cooperating is that just everybody in the Linux world does
not share your set of dogmata, the recent discussion about addressing devices
being a prime example. Although I very much appreciate your experience with
CD recording, I feel that the ways of referring to devices should be best
left to Linux developers.
(BTW: I am not sure I haven't missed anything in the long cdrecord-related
threads on the LKML, but I still haven't seen what is exactly so broken on the
cdrecord shipped by SUSE.)
				Have a nice fortnight
