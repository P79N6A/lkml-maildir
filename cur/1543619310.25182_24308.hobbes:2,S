It's not related to the client at all. It's reproducable with
dd if=file00 of=/dev/null &
dd if=file01 of=/dev/null &
dd if=file02 of=/dev/null &
dd if=file03 of=/dev/null &
dd if=file04 of=/dev/null &
.
.
.
dd if=file99 of=/dev/null &
It's reproducable on all 2.4.x I've tried. That is - with slight
differences
