You are correct. Many processors can not increment a memory location
directly. They have to read into a register, modify, then write it
back. At the bus level, even processors that do it all in one op-code
are really reading/modifying/writing. However, such processors are
not interrupted between these operations so they are atomic (for
that operation on that CPU only).
