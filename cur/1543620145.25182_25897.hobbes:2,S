IANAL either, but I don't think you're right.  Since somebody has distributed 
the bzImage to him, that somebody is obligated to provide him the source code 
- the full source code - if he requests it.  In my opinion, the .config has 
to be considered part of the source code since it's needed in order to 
compile the binary he received.  This issue needs to be clarified.
