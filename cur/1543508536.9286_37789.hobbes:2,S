I just noticed this in our logs (it was sufficiently important to pop up
on my virtual console):
Sep  8 08:15:14 central kernel: TCP: **bug**: copy=0, sk->mss=0 
Sep  8 08:15:14 central kernel: tcp_new_window: mss fell to 0. 
Sep  8 08:15:16 central kernel: tcp_new_window: mss fell to 0. 
We're running 2.0.37, doing IP firewalling, transparent proxying and the
whole works - I'm just raising this in case anyone is interested, because
it doesn't mean anything to me. Nothing seems to have broken here as a
result. If anyone wants more details, I can try to provide them.
