I strongly disagree. Moving this back into the architechture code for
some micro optimizations is the wrong way to go and a big step back from
Johns patches.
As John correctly analyzed we have dozens of gettimeofday/settimeofday
implementations which are roughly the same and I dont see a benefit to
keep it that way.
The timekeeping is a core functionality which should and can be
completely abstracted. This way we can ensure that the timekeeping is
consistent across architectures. So improvements and extensions to the
core code are immidiately available for all architectures rather than
updating 26 architecture implementations every time.
This allows to handle generic problems like suspend/resume, dynamic
ticks and others in a central place rather than scattered all over the
architecture code.
Same applies for clock source management and switching clock sources.

This is a question of implementation details rather than a design
question. 
Can we please concentrate on a clear and generic design model before
discussing optimizations of 20 lines of code?
