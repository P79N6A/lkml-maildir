RTFPOSIX...
Short version:
	* immutable files are immutable, including metadata
	* append-only files may be touched (when you write to the end), which
means that you can touch them.  Which is what utimes(file, NULL) does.
	* you can not truncate append-only file, overwrite already written
data or set timestamps to arbitrary values.
That's where the difference between utimes(file, NULL) and utimes(file, p)
is - the former basically is a write-without-write ("touch foo") and the
latter directly assigns to timestamps.  Permissions needed for these are
obviously different.
Please, read POSIX/SuS when modifying behaviour of syscalls.  Really.
