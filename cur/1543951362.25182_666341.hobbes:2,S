Subject: [RFC][PATCH] n_tty : Loss of sync following a buffer overflow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/11/289

From: Rupesh Sugathan <Rupesh.Sugathan@gmail.com>
There seems to be a synchronization issue with the n_tty.c driver when
working in canonical mode.
The n_tty rightly discards data received following a buffer overflow and
hence the tty->read_cnt is not updated. However, the newline characters
received following a buffer overflow seems to increment the tty-
>canon_data index. This may result in a loss of sync between the tty-
>canon_data & tty->read_cnt while processing read in the read_chan().
This loss of sync might be irrecoverable even when the data is later
received at a slower rate.
----
I am not very sure if there is any deliberate rationale to process the
newlines even when the buffer has overflown. Please comment and review
the patch
