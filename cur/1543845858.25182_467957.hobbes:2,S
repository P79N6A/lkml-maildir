In some more rational parts of the world (presuming they exist
evidence to the contrary) this approach might work. This requires
a people and government that are rather libertarian with the people
taking full responsibility for their own actions. Now, I live in
the country that awarded a woman millions of dollars because she
was stupid enough to put a hot container of coffee in her lap as
she reached over to her purse to make change. Of course it spilled
and scorched her in a "nasty place to be scorched." This is also
the country that awarded two drunken idiots who decided to trim a
hedge with a rotary lawn mower. They tried to pick it up by the
skirts and lost their fingers to the spinning blades. They sued
the manufacturer for allowing them to be stupid - and won. So the
blunt answer is "Product Liability."

Those warnings probably are not enough in a US court of law. But
they are enough to discourage most idiots who do get blinded by
their own stupidity from trying to sue.

The bozo has to go through enough effort to build such a jammer
that it'd (mostly) insulate the parts manufactures from liability.
It's a little more work than pulling some CDROM screws and blinding
people in the room as a result. (Yeah, I darned well know how little
actual work is involved. But actual knowledge is also involved so it
would be hard for that jammer to escape personal responsibility. Of
course, there is the spark gap jammer.... Anecdotal evidence shows
that the spark gap noise can motivate the Los Angeles FCC office to
get off their lazy asses in a hurry, though.)
