This was previouly discussed on this list, but there wasn't really a helpful
answer that I could find on the archives.
Anyway, I'm running an Asus A7M266-D with a single Morgan core Duron
(default everything, no overclocking).
I get this repeatedly:
APIC error on CPU0: 04(04)
This happens with APIC or SMP enabled in the kernel. I recompiled the kernel
without APIC support, and the errors are gone (no surprise there! :-) There
doesn't appear to be any instability, or other negative side effects. I've
basically recompiled the kernel ~5 times without problems.
What I'd like to know is, what are those APIC errors - causes, etc? Do they
matter? (Are these actual errors caused by some hardware malfunction that
may be damaging my CPU/Board?)
Any information anyone could give me would be great,
Thanks,
jon anderson
