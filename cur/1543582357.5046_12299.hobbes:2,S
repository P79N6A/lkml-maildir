Just installed 2.4.2pre4, seems to be stable for now (testing it ATM,
running dnetc, several kernel compiles etc.). On 2.4.1 even su segfault'd if
the server were loaded. But, the problems have never appeared before after
one or two days uptime, so we'll just have to see what happens later on.
As the BIOS settings are the same on both servers, and the CPU temperature
peaked at +43.5C on the crashing server, I might just think it's a software
bug. Well, time will tell :-)
Thanks for the input
