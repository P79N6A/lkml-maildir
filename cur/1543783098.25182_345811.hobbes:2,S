vermagic is very crude and there are zillions of other details and 
.config flags that might make a module incompatible. You can use 
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS to get a stronger protection that vermagic, but 
that's far from perfect too. The right solution is the module signing 
framework in Fedora. Until that gets merged upstream just dont mix 
incompatible modules, and keep things tightly packaged.
