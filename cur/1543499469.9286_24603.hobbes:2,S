I guess I should have been more clear. I copied that section of code and
explicitly executed it on the matrox card. It was rather futile anyways,
the exercise I put myself through didn't fix the problem.

Okay. I simply looked at how the matrox video card was configured when it
was configured as the "primary video card" and tried to have it's PCI
setting match when it wasn't the primary.

Your function worked for all practical purposes. I needed to stuff the
resulting bases in dev->base_address[idx], but other than that, it
worked (I also added a "base++;" line at the end of the function).

I'm in the process of pestering Tyan right now... (They haven't responded
to my message yet.)
I'll take my other fbcon experiences to the linux-fbdev list.
Thanks!
