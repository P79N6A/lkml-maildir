We had the same problem with openGL applications here at the university. Suse 10
uses a daemon called resmgr that changes the /dev files ownership to the current user
who logs in. check /etc/resmgr.conf.d/*, /etc/resmgr.conf and the docs for
resmgr on how to add yourself to the, I think is the "desktop" group in resmgr
terms, in order to change ownership.
