Actually, I've tried both the 3-way and the 2-way merge tools ...

... and I prefer the one which is chosen with 'f2', nothing beats
the [left] [right] buttons!
I guess maybe 10% of the time I need to edit something by hand,
but by far the most of the time I can just choose the code variant
on the left or on the right.
One mouse click is so much easier and faster than editing 5 lines
of code.

Rik
