A few important bugfixes have come up in the last few days so I'm offerring an 
incremental bugfix patch for ck7. 
http://kernel.kolivas.org
The current updates include
fixes to my vm hacks - one corner case would make it swap out when it needed 
not to.
Update to supermount due to bug making ro disks unreadable if fs mounted rw 
and vice versa.
The elevator fix is in. Read latency2 is out.
If you do use the update, check the date versioning to tell you if you have 
the latest.
