Ahh, that was about when I subscribed, I must have just missed it.

Well that was interesting.. I started X, told the battery monitor not to 
start on X startup, stopped X and re-started it, and the machine totaly 
hard locked. No Alt-Sysrq, no external ping.. no nothing..
After a hard re-boot, I can confirm that not running the ACPI battery 
monitor solves (works around) the problem. Problem being I now have no 
idea when my battery is going to die :p)
Thanks for the quick response.
