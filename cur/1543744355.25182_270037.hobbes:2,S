Several definitions are possible, this is really a source of
confusion. Any of these can be reconstructed if one has access to the
constituents: node-to-node latency (SLIT), cache-to-cache
latencies. The later ones aren't available and would anyhow be better
placed in something like /proc/cpuinfo or similar. They are CPU or
package specific and have nothing to do with NUMA.

This should be done by correctly setting up the sched domains. It's
not a question of exporting useless or redundant information to user
space.
The need for some (any) cpu-to-cpu metrics initially brought up by
Jack seemed mainly motivated by existing user space tools for
constructing cpusets (maybe in PBS). I think it is a tolerable effort
to introduce in user space an inlined function or macro doing
something like
   cpu_metric(i,j) := node_metric(cpu_node(i),cpu_node(j))
It keeps the kernel free of misleading information which might just
slightly make cpusets construction more comfortable. In user space you
have the full freedom to enhance your metrics when getting more
details about the next generation cpus.
