I totally agree with you, it could be great to fix netlink to support
multiple queue.
I like to be able to use projects like snort-inline or nufw together.
This will make Netfilter really stronger.
Furthermore, there's a repetition of filtering capabilities with such a
solution. Netfilter has to filter to send to netlink and this is the
same with the queue dispatcher. I think this introduce too much
complexity.
