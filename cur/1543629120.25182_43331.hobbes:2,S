Doesn't everyone reserve more than the write asks for?
Delayed allocation as implemented in XFS means that during a write
call which has to make more room in a file, a super block counter
is changed, and the extent information is recorded in an in memory
structure associated with the inode.
Yes, if you have all your metadata buffers sitting in memory and are
not journalling changes then all you are doing is a different set of
memory manipulations which are noise on modern cpus when compared with
actually moving the file data out to disk.
