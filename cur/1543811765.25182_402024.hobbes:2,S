Right.

Nope. The "why a FS might want it" part is pretty clear (we do have
symlinks to directories as a poor man's substitute, after all), the "why it
can't be allowed" part is the tricky one...
- It creates the possibility of loops ==> The garbage collection of unused
  stuff can't be done just by reference counts (as today), and gets very
  hairy... and needs a /lot/ of memory.
- Loop detection/breaking in a general graph /can't/ be done while it is
  being updated, and they thake a long time (and lots of memory)
- Can't just assume that by locking in the directory/subdirectory/... order
  no deadlocks are possible, and traversing the filesystem for surgery gets
  to be one operation at a time, not concurrent as today
- A while back (in one of the recurrent ReiserFS flamewars Re: Files as
  directories, which creates exactly the same situation when linking to a
  file-is-a-directory) somebody (Linus? Ted T'so?) showed that certain
  simple operations would potentially require exponential time or memory (I
  forget which), and thus the idea was out of the question.
Sure, the situations that give rise to the problems are rather clear-cut,
and could be disallowed, but the result for the user would have seemingly
random restrictions. IMVHO it is much better to have a restricted system
with a simple conceptual model than a more relaxed one, but with hard to
understand corner cases it doesn't allow.
