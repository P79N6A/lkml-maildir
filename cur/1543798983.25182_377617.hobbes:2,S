While the ISDN is indeed called a network, devices connecting a computer
to it are nevertheless not commonly referred to as network devices.

There's more to it than that. The notion of a "network" is a rather
broad one, including such diverse phenomena as Ethernet, ISDN, TV cable
or even roads or TV stations. The notion of a "network device", on the
other hand, is a quite specific one, at least in the computer world, and
it certainly doesn't include ISDN TAs.
In fact, the operation of an ISDN device is much closer to a modem or
even an answering machine than to that prototypical network device which
is the Ethernet card. This is of course the reason why the Linux kernel
puts them in a subsystem of their own. Making them net_device-s just
wouldn't work.
