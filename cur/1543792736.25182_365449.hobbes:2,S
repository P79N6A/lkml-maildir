Correct because bar() could have modified (it's global).

Maybe you tried to trick me by showing the variable was not going
to be changed (const *). In that case, the compiler may not re-read
the variable. However, it can re-read the variable.
A "smart" compiler might just do: write(1, "0\n", 2);
... for the first printf() as well. Such compilers make
debugging difficult.
