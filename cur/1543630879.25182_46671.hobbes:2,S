Is supermount compiled into kernel or as a module? What drive, what media did 
you mount, what command did you issue? 
I tested it with supermount compiled into the kernel and
# mount -t supermount -o dev=/dev/hdb none /mnt/cdrom
# ls -l /mnt/cdrom
and
# cd /mnt/cdrom
# ls -l
# cd
# umount /mnt/cdrom
and it works fine for me, patched against 2.4.19-pre8-jp12, and /dev/hdb is 
an ISO 9660 CDROM in my DVD drive. No "stale NFS handles", clean mount and 
unmount, and with "debug" option I can see it works as a charme.
ftpfs is fixed in the same way but I did not reboot yet.
