Hi,
   I am trying to write a driver which uses double, float. I am using
an arm11 with gcc 3.4.4
   When i try to compile my modules (with float variables) i get the error
   WARNING: "__extendsfdf2" undefined!
   WARNING: "__mulsf3"undefined!
   WARNING: "__fixsfsi"undefined!
   WARNING: "__floatsisf"undefined!
   Can we use float, double in kernel modules?.
  Obviously it is a linking error, I am using soft-float. I tried with
-msoft-float but got the same   result.
  I suspect that its a toolchain issue.  However i am able to compile
my applications
  with float, double variables.
  Please do advice.
Regards,
sriram
