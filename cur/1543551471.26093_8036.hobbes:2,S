When I copy a file from my linux partition to my windows partition 
and the filename is not in 8.3 format I get an error when I check my 
disk for errors saying that the long filename is no longer associated 
with a file.  After fixing this the filename is in 8.3 format.  Files 
already wine 8.3 format filenames do not have this error.  
I've had this error with other 2.4.0-test kernels also. I'll download 
the patches today and try to find out when this started happening.
You do not need to send me replies since I am on the list.
