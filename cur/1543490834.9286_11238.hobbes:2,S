I am experiencing random errors involving a server with a Adaptec 2940UW
controller. I have an Asus Pentium II motherboard with 256 Megs non-ECC
memory, an Adaptec 2940UW controller and a Quantum 8 gig drive. I'm sure
its not a broken SCSI controller or drive, as I moved both (individually
and seperatly) to another PII machine and they worked flawlesly. I get
random errors from the drive, usually happens when there is a medium
amount or higher of disk activity. This is the only drive on the system.
I'm using 2.0 kenrels when this happens. If anyone has any ideas, let me
know?
Geoff
