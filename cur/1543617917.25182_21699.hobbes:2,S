Hi Ingo,
while debugging the IA64 race-conditions with the new scheduler some
question/suggestion came to my mind.
In the load_balance() function the initial value for max_load should
better be set to 1 instead of 0 in order to avoid finding 'busiest'
runqueues with only one task. This avoids taking the spin-locks
unnecessarily for the case idle=1.
Another issue: I don't understand how prev_max_load works, I think that
the comments in load_balance are not true any more and the comparison to
prev_max_load can be dropped. In the loop where you compare wit hit it
will never have another value than 1000000000. Or am I completely
misunderstanding the code?
Thanks,
best regards,
Erich
