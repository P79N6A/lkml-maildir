So the proper defect management would be to simply initialize the broken
sector once a fsck hits it (still, I've never seen disks develop so many
bad blocks so quickly as those failed DTLA-307045 drives I had).
Note, the specifications say that the write cache setting is ignored
when the drive runs out of spare blocks for reassignment after defects
(so that the drive can return the error code right away when it cannot
guarantee the write actually goes to disk).
