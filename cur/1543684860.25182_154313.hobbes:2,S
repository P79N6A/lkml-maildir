Actually I think that is the crux of the problem.  If I do:
    touch a
    ln a b
then a and b are both links to the same file.  It is not like a is the
real file and b is a link to it.  The situation is indistinguishable
from:
    touch b
    ln b a
When you say that you want hardlinks to work on directories I believe
people are making the assumption that you want this to hold true for
directories as well.  The difference between hardlinking directories
and using symlinks or mount --bind is that there IS a difference between
a directory and a link to the directory.
Thanks,
Jim
