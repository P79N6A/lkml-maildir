Which box did you get?
I have a relatively new Netserver which has two 53c896 controllers on
it. However there is a problem with the PCI bridges which makes all
motherboard mounted PCI devices show up twice in the PCI lists, Martin
Mares sent me a patch for this, but it's not in the Red Hat install
kernel.
To get the thing installed I plugged in an Adaptec 2940 and used that
during installation. I then compiled a new kernel where I hacked the
53c8xx driver to only look for two controllers (it goes boink when it
tries initing the same controller twice - in parallel) and now it runs
fine.
