Well, I'm running Debian 2.2 (with a few recompiled newer packages, as well
as a recompiled glibc 2.1.3 obviously), which comes with bash 2.03.
Compiling & installing bash 2.05, and commenting out that line in
/etc/pam.d/ssh that was mentioned in the web page you provided unfortunately
didn't change anything - the ulimit for file size was still unlimited, and I
still couldn't write >2GB files.

If you use an older distro, bash will not handle the changed getrlimit
syscall in 2.4, for details check the Red Hat entry under:
