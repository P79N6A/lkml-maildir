EXPORT_SYMBOL(pidhash) or something. Make sure you included sched.h

How early are you trying to do this?

I'm afraid there's only so much help that can be given. Some effort may
be required on your part to make this work. Help with basic concepts

#kernelnewbies or the kernelnewbies@nl.linux.org mailing list.
Cheers,
