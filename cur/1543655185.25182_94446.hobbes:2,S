There are several causes of an NMI depending on the system - hardware
failures is one, some systems do it for things like PCI errors, a few
boxes you see them on power management events (notably old 486's)

Then buy better ram ;)

Take a sample set of machines which have been crashing and run memtest86
on a couple. That should tell you if it is RAM. From a sample you can
then figure out how to handle the rest (things that come to mind if
memtest86 fails on the test machines include replacing the ram in a few
more then taking the old ram back to test)
