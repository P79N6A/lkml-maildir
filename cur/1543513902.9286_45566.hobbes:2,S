If you are able to mount your file-system, i.e., you booted with a
floppy, look in /boot/ for a file called /boot/boot.####, where ####
is the major/minor number of the device used to boot. This is the
first 512 bites that existed on your boot drive the first time you
installed LILO. If the partition(s) were not extended, and if
they were not changed since then, just do:
	cp /boot/boot.#### /dev/boot_device 
	The boot device is the boot device shown in /etc/lilo.conf,
	__NOT__ the root partition.
Then execute lilo with no command-line parameters. It should no longer
complain and the machine should be bootable. If you have multiple
extended partitions, this won't work. In any event, you won't
hurt the rest of the file-system so recovery tools can still be
used.
