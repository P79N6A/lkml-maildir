The client has krb5 authentication support, the server doesn't.  Patches
are available from the citi web page for server-side authentication and
client-side integrity.

The test1 patches probably apply (possibly with some manual
intervention) up to about test6.  At least one of them (the first gss
patch) is a fairly critical bugfix.  I'm just updating to test7 myself
right now; I'll try to post new patches soon, but in the worst case it
might not be till after we get back from testing at Connectathon (in two
weeks).
