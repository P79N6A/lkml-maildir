No Linux doesn't grab 0x3f6 - what it grabs is 0x3f0-0x3f5 and 0x3f7 -
exactly as reported by w98 - however 0x3f0-0x3f1 have already been
reserved by the pnpbios code, since they are listed in the bios as
motherboard resources, while 0x3f2-03xf5 and 03xf7 are listed as floppy
-> the problem is that the floppy reserves ports that it does not need (in
fact it could skip reserving 0x3f3 also...)
