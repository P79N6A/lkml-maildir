Hmm.  This is going to be subject to random compiler padding.  It would
be much better to have:
	__u8 mode;
	__u8 namelen;
	__u16 flags;
	__u32 lkid;
	__u32 parent;
which should be less subject to compiler padding.

Ditto - though maybe following this by:
	__u8 unused[3];
would be a sane solution.

Ditto.
