Well it turns out that I was having a less-than-usually-senile moment:

: 
:     implement flush_work()
: 
:     A basic problem with flush_scheduled_work() is that it blocks behind _all_
:     presently-queued works, rather than just the work whcih the caller wants to
:     flush.  If the caller holds some lock, and if one of the queued work happens
:     to want that lock as well then accidental deadlocks can occur.
: 
:     One example of this is the phy layer: it wants to flush work while holding
:     rtnl_lock().  But if a linkwatch event happens to be queued, the phy code will
:     deadlock because the linkwatch callback function takes rtnl_lock.
: 
:     So we implement a new function which will flush a *single* work - just the one
:     which the caller wants to free up.  Thus we avoid the accidental deadlocks
:     which can arise from unrelated subsystems' callbacks taking shared locks.
: 
:     flush_work() non-blockingly dequeues the work_struct which we want to kill,
:     then it waits for its handler to complete on all CPUs.
: 
:     Add ->current_work to the "struct cpu_workqueue_struct", it points to
:     currently running "struct work_struct". When flush_work(work) detects
:     ->current_work == work, it inserts a barrier at the _head_ of ->worklist
:     (and thus right _after_ that work) and waits for completition. This means
:     that the next work fired on that CPU will be this barrier, or another
:     barrier queued by concurrent flush_work(), so the caller of flush_work()
:     will be woken before any "regular" work has a chance to run.
: 
:     When wait_on_work() unlocks workqueue_mutex (or whatever we choose to protect
:     against CPU hotplug), CPU may go away. But in that case take_over_work() will
:     move a barrier we queued to another CPU, it will be fired sometime, and
:     wait_on_work() will be woken.
: 
:     Actually, we are doing cleanup_workqueue_thread()->kthread_stop() before
:     take_over_work(), so cwq->thread should complete its ->worklist (and thus
:     the barrier), because currently we don't check kthread_should_stop() in
:     run_workqueue(). But even if we did, everything should be ok.
Why isn't that working in this case??
