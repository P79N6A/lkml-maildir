From my reading of Intel specs, these priority decode rules apply only
to legacy VGA aperture (which doesn't have a BAR anyway) - that's why you
cannot have both internal and external VGA working together on these
chipsets. But for any normal BAR classic PCI bridge decode still works
as expected.
However, mapping a BAR outside the decode window of a PCI bridge
can be dangerous for another reason - it could clash with DMA from
a sibling device. Either with DMA to system RAM, if you put that BAR
below the parent bridge window, or with MSI, if you put it above...
So disabling memory or IO decode in a command register seems to be
the only safe option. This depends on architecture, though.
