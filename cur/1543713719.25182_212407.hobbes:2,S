Subject: [PATCH 2.6] net/sk98lin: correct buggy VPD in ASUS MB
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/6/317

The following patch to net/sk98lin/skvpd.c was put together by Marc
Bouget, mbouget at club-internet.fr.  He currently doesn't have time to
interface with linux-kernel so I offered to work that front.
This patch works around a corrupt EEPROM (VPD?) in the ASUS K8V Deluxe
SE motherboard ethernet chipset and allows the network driver to work
correctly.  We have written to ASUS and the sk98lin maintainers but have
not heard anything back.
Does this have a chance to be included in mainline or is there a
preferable way to fix these kind of issues?
