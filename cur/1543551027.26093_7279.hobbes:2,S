this is such a special case it is not worth considering - rather
leave it up to the designer of the router floppy to get his stuff
right.
the one thing that is clear from the many OOM flamewars is that no
OOM reaper algorithm will satisfy 100% of conditions 100% of the
time. So all Rik can do is optimise for the common case.
(roll on beancounting and proper resource limiting - the true but
heavyweight solution)
