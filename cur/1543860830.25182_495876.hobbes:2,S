Believe it or not, but server companies like Panasas try to follow the standard
when designing and implementing their products while relying on client vendors
to do the same.
I sincerely expect you or anybody else for this matter to try to provide
feedback and object to the protocol specification in case they disagree
with it (or think it's ambiguous or self contradicting) rather than ignoring
it and implementing something else. I think we're shooting ourselves in the
foot when doing so and it is in our common interest to strive to reach a
realistic standard we can all comply with and interoperate with each other.
