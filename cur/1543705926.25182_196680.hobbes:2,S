Nope.  This is a bug in the 2.4.x ide driver.  I sent in a patch
for it a while back that made it into 2.6, but not into 2.4.
Basically, the 2.4.x ide driver always asks the drive if it
supports HPA.  In this case, your drive is old and doesn't know
what an HPA is, and complains.  Some older drives get confused
and have to be power cycled when this happens.
