Hi,
I have a problem with the new version of bttv in 2.2.0-pre8. I had no
problem using my Hauppauge WinNT card with the previous pre versions. This
evening I tried using the pre8 release together with XawTV, but the
machine was unusable because the msp3400 processes was using 99.9% CPU
time (under pre7 it uses 0.1%).
Under pre8 I get the following output:
bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 18) bus: 0, devfn: 144, irq: 17, memory: 0xeecff000. 
PCI: Enabling bus mastering for device 00:90 
bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found. 
bttv0: Hauppauge eeprom: tuner=Philips FI1216 MK2 (5) 
bttv0: model: BT848(Hauppauge old) 
msp3400: init: chip=MSP3410D-B4, has NICAM support
While pre7 logs:
bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 18) bus: 0, devfn: 144, irq: 17, memory: 0xeecff000. 
bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found. 
bttv0: model: HAUPPAUGE 
msp3400: init: chip=MSP3410D-B4, has NICAM support, registered as sound mixer 
bttv: PCI display adapter: <3>bttv: Unknown video memory base address. 
bttv: Video memory override: 0xe5000000 
(the same).
In both cases the MSP is identified correctly (ITT MSP 3410D-PS-B4 on
chip).
This is on an SMP machine.
