You snipped the part where I said that the intel compiler is likely to be 
more interesting to a number of people, since it's at a higher level. So 
no, I'm not religious about licenses.
But the real issue is "does it do what we want it to do?" and "do we have
a choice?". There are no open-source SCM's that work for me. But there
_is_ an open-source compiler that does work for me. At which point the
license matters - simply because there is choice in the matter.
Gcc mostly works. But it's slower then I'd like. And it prioritizes things
I don't care about. And competition is always good. So I would definitely 
love to see some alternatives.
And if you have issues with BK, maybe you can try to encourage the SCM
people to see why I consider BK to not even have alternatives right now.
