I don't know much about Softupdate myself, but I have heard rumor of a
patch for ext2 fsck which supposedly speeds it up.  It was on one of the
lists I frequent.  Haven't looked into that myself either.  I gather it's
probably not gonna be THAT much faster with hundreds of gigs of data
though either.
