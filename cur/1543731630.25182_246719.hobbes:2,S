I'm thinking of two options for removing the gamma drm
1. Submit a Kconfig patch to mark it broken, see if anyone shouts..
2. Submit a patch to nuke it.
We believe it it has no current users, and it probably is broken but no
one knows.. it allows the drm reorg to me an easier job if the gamma
doesn't have to be worried about..
Dave.
