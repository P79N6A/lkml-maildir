Well, how about this as a compromise?  We define a new superblock
field which reserves a certain amount of space in the EA block for
"system" attributes.  The default will be zero, but if we want to
reserve space for the ACL, we can do that by adjusting the superblock
field.  (I'll add support into tune2fs for that purpose.)
I'll then remove the CONFIG #ifdef's and the user_xattr mount options.
(I hate having too many mount options, and this sort of thing should
be a per-filesystem run-time decision, not a compile-time option.)
Andreas, does that sound good to you?
