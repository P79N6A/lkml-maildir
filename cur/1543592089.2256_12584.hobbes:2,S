Linux is the os where you often, but not necessarily will get help form
newsgroups and mailinglists.  Particularly, try finding the _right_

Why would anyone lift a finger for you?  Did _you_ ever help someone?
I (and many others) couldn't help because we don't know anything about
your driver and havent used UDF.  Seek out those few who knows.
