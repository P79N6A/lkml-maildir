It seems like it would best be done at the class level, rather than the
core driver level, if you wanted to do it all. For things like
communication devices going out of range, you would probably want to
easily support multiple drivers of the same type, so you might as well
abstract it to the class. And, I don't see a reason for it to be
synchronous, since any apps trying to communicate over it will soon
realize it's not available; and any policy in userspace shouldn't by
definition be that critical to the health of the system.
Display blanking is based on user input inactivity, and already works on
most systems.
