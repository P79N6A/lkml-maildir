Don't use errno in the kernel. EVER. This is a bug, we should get rid of
it.
Please fix "mount()" instead.
"errno" is one of those few _really_ bad stupidities in UNIX. Linux has
fixed it, and doesn't use it internally, and never shall. Too bad that
user space has to fix up the _correct_ error code returning that the
kernel does, and turn it into the "errno" stupidity for backwards
compatibility.
(If you care why "errno" is stupid, just think about threading and
performance)
