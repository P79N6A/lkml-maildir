You do not want to be too specific though - a kernel with features
X, Y, and Z in the current setup can boot using any of those features
by just supplying the appropriate command line.
The reason HPA wanted to go down the userspace route, btw, was to
support additional add-ons for bringing other stuff up - remember this
is part of the initramfs spec that was reviewed by this list many
months ago?  Or has that now gone completely out of the window?
