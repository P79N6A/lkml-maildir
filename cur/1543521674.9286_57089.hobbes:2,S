Hold on. Inode is not a good thing here - if (_big_ if) you need per-file
data - refer to it from struct file (that is, if you really need it on
per-opener basis; _very_ rare situation). If you need it on per-device -
keep it in the driver. Inode gives either too coarse or too fine
granularity here - there may be a lot of independent openers of inode and
there may be many inodes pointing to your device. In effect, device inode
acts as a sort of symlink - just that it points into other namespace.
