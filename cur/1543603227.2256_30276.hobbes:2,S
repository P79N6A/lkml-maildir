Subject: NFS atime problem in ac kernels

In fs/nfs/inode.c, the function __nfs_refresh_inode() has a
line removed (see below) from all recent ac kernels.  This
may be the reason why, in ac kernels but not in Linus kernels,
the atime of a file in an NFS mounted directory does not get
updated after file access.  Putting the line back has solved
the problem for me.
