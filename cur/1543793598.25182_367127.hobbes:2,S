hey, great, that's farther than I got.

any chance you could obtain additional debugging output by turning on
#undef ATA_DEBUG                /* debugging output */
#undef ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG        /* yet more debugging output */
in include/linux/libata.h?  this would help us see where it is stuck in 
'D' state.
Also, you might try turning off CONFIG_PCI_MSI, in case MSI is 
problematic on your machine, or on this card.

That's expect, as we just use a simple counter to create a unique id:
         host->unique_id = ata_unique_id++;
