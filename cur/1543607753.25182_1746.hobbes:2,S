The Scyld drivers have only recently started working with the 2.4 series,
and there is some unholly war between Becker and the rest of the kernel
hackers...so I don't think you'll ever see his drivers in the standard
kernel again...  RH usually tries to load the e100 (Intel's driver)
instead of the eepro100.  The e100's license is close to compatible
with the kernel, and I've heard rumors that the remaining issues may
be worked out...  I've also heard the code is ugly as hell...but it
does seem to work.  If only the e100 supported MII IOCTLs then I'd
use it all the time!
