FWIW, I've updated the ftp area now.

Is this a large filesystem?  Any chance we can get access to
it somehow (e.g. xfs_copy to a sparse file, then send me a
pointer to it) to reproduce the problem locally?

Once you save a copy of it for further analysis of xfs_repair,
if you can, you can clear out this problem by directly poking at
the device using xfs_db in expert mode.  "xfs_db -x /dev/xxx";
then "inode 1507133580"; then "write core.mode 0"; and then try
another xfs_repair run.  Please try capture the fs for us first
though (if possible) else we're going to struggle to improve on
this aspect of xfs_repair.  Send me some private mail if you do
manage to grab the fs and put it someplace for me.
thanks.
