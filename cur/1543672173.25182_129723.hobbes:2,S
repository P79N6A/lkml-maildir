ok, thanks to all folks for help,
i'm now using 2.5.68 with linux-isp patch for qlogic support, system is
working nice, i see all 8 processors but cpuinfo shows only 199 bogomips,
but system performance is much much higher :), so meaby this is some kind of
not important bug.
as for now i will try to swich to 2.4.21-rc1 as Keith Mannthey gave me
working kernel config for 2.4
so now  i've got one of them (servers) for kernel testing :)
from the battle field - i tryied to run on 2.5.68-mm3 tree but system hangs
on processors recognition.
as for qlogic support with linux-isp - is this driver with failover support?
regards
WS
