Last evening I got my hands back on that machine,
checked the kernel-config, and saw that GPT was 
already *unselected*!
Actually, the whole "Advanced partition..."-bundle
was unchecked.
While I can't tell whether the disk has such a thing,
(The kernel used at partitioning time might have had
GPT enabled. the tool used was either fdisk or cfdisk,
I don't remember exactly, but never use anything else.
It's about 3 years since.)
Turning off GPT in the current kernel obviously
*does not* solve the problem. :-(
Anything else I could do, short of patching ide-disk.c?
