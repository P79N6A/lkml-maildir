Agreed. I do not really think that it makes sense to move "drivers/net" to
"net/drivers" even if it _would_ be the logical way to group all net
things together. Whatever potential incremental advantage (if any) just
isn't worth the disruption.

No, I hate to create structure abstractions for their own sake, and a
"subsys" kind of abstraction doesn't really add any information.
I have no problems with making the linux "root" directory a bit larger,
it's certainly not problematic (what, 22 entries, and no new ones
generated dynamically - fits on one screen even on an old vt100).
That might change if we end up creating _more_ subdirectories, of course,
although even then I'd really want to group them according to some clear
goal or property of the grouping (ie not "subsys" kinds of things).
