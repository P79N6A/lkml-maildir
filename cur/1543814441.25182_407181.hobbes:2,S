I have not seen anything resembling such a lockup.
However you are doing something odd here.
While you created a subcpuset 'a', you changed the
cpus and cpu_exclusive in the root cpuset.  This
changed -all- tasks to only be allowed to run on
cpu 7.
I'd guess you have some kernel thread or such that
really, really wants to run on some other cpu.
When I read you transcript, I expected it to say:
	# mkdir /dev/cpuset
	# mount -t cpuset cpuset /dev/cpuset	# s/none/cpuset/ - clearer
	# cd /dev/cpuset
	# mkdir a
	# cd a					# the missing step
	# /bin/echo 7 > cpus
	# /bin/echo 1 > cpu_exclusive
The s/none/cpuset/ in the mount command is just a nit.
That field shows up in various mount command error
messages, and 'cpuset' is alot clearer than 'none' in
such messages.
When I do your commands (without the 'cd a'), I don't
see any problem or hang on my Altix test box.  But that
probably just means I am not critically depending at that
moment on some kernel thread running on any particular cpu.
