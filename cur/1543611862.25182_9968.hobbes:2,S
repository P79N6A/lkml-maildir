The schedule I heard from Linus at the kernel summit was that both changes 
were to go in between 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.   I would prefer sooner than later 
because I'm *really* *tired* of maintaining a parallel rulebase.

A ``decay in the social contract'' is detectable; there is a growing
feeling, particularly among middle-income taxpayers, that they are not
getting back, from society and government, their money's worth for
taxes paid. The tendency is for taxpayers to try to take more control
of their finances ..
