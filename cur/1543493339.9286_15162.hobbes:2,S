Hi!
I've a problem with my ALPHA-box. It's running with a 2.0.36-kernel (Debian-Kernel)
But I DO have problems upgrading kernel to 2.2.5. The system boots up, but the 
SCSI-Driver says CACHE INCORECTLY CONFIGURED -- is that a problem in kernel
or in my system-configuration?? If system-configuration, would someone please help 
me??
Bye, Nils
