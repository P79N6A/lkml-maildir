Hmm. I guess that your and my definition of 'Joe Six-Pack' is different. In
my world, Joe Six-Pack won't be compiling and running disk2brick.c on a
Linux box. Joe Six-ack has difficulty even leaving X without hand holding.
But that is a moot point. I think, idealistically, your position is correct.
What I think you are incorrect about is the urgency with which you advocate
your position. The fix is not urgent, it's minor. There are ways of frying
hardware in userspace, a real where Joe Six-Pack is FAR more likely to be...
protection in the kernel against one specific hack adds little security.
As someone else pointed out, now is not the time to be adding changes like
this (just before a stable release). Offer the patch after the next stable
kernel, when less urgent changes are easier to get in. Remember that you're
not patching a gaping hole... you're blocking one of a hundred ways that
root can fry hardware. There are many other ways still to go, so having 99
ways to fry the system, instead of 100, is not that big of a fix. Eventually
we may get down to 0, but until we get close to that ideal, each cemented
hole is a minor change not urgent enough to risk destabilizing an even
release.
