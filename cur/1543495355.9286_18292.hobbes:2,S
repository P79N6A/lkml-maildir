Subject: Can't mount ISO images via loopback driver in 2.2.7-ac2

I am running the 2.2.7 kernel, with the second Alan Cox patch. I noticed
last night that the loopback driver was apparently not working. I checked,
and it apparently was compiled into the kernel during my last build. IS
there a way to check to make sure that it is available in my current
kernel? When I try to mount a CD image, I get no error messages; but if I
then try to ls the contents, there is nothing there. Is there anything
that could cause this besides a kernel problem, or not having the loopback
driver in the kernel?
