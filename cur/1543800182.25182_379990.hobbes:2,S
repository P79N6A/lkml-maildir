The breakage issue is ridiculous, assinine, and unnecessary. I have been 
porting dsfs to the various releases over the past month,
and the breakage of user space, usb, nfs, memory management, is beyond 
absurd. Instead of constantly breaking the
interfaces in Linux, why not tell people **NO** every time they try to 
rewrite the memory management, etc.
Instead of creating new capabilities and features, everyone seems hell 
bent on rewriting the same stale, mouldy, boring sections
of the OS over and over again. So how many times does the memory manage 
and slab allocator need to get rewritten. Or how many
times does the vfs need to get broken over and over again.
This bullshit is killing Linux, it's too much work to keep up with 
breakage, most of which is INTENTIONAL and NEEDLESS.
STOP STOP STOP!!!
I can't even apply a kdb patch between . releases of the kernel without 
seeing major breakage between Kprobes and some other
BS someone decides to change for no other reason than THEY CAN DO IT. I 
have seen memory corruption in the rrecent kernels.
When a component of the OS is finished, then leave it the hell alone.
The only NEW features in Linux are more drivers and more processors. 
Most of what's been going on in the development over the
past few months has been unnecessary breakage. If you are trying to get 
people to stay off Linux as a stable platform, you are all
succeeding.
