I'm reading this, and looking at a patch from Russell King that entirely
nukes several functions, and adds several new ones:
-static int setup_socket(socket_info_t *);
 static void shutdown_socket(socket_info_t *);
-static void reset_socket(socket_info_t *);
-static void unreset_socket(socket_info_t *);
 static void parse_events(void *info, u_int events);
+static void sm_init(socket_info_t *s);
+static void sm_exit(socket_info_t *s);
And yes, that's in something that could be a module (pcmcia/cs.c).
(Yes Russell, I'll test it when I get home - the offending card is there
and I'm here at the moment.. ;)
