The Coverity checker spotted the following NULL dereference of "skb" in 
drivers/usb/gadget/ether.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int
rx_submit (struct eth_dev *dev, struct usb_request *req, gfp_t gfp_flags)
{
        struct sk_buff          *skb;
        int                     retval = -ENOMEM;
...
        if ((skb = alloc_skb (size + NET_IP_ALIGN, gfp_flags)) == 0) {
                DEBUG (dev, "no rx skb\n");
                goto enomem;
        }
...
enomem:
                defer_kevent (dev, WORK_RX_MEMORY);
        if (retval) {
                DEBUG (dev, "rx submit --> %d\n", retval);
                dev_kfree_skb_any (skb);
...
<--  snip  -->

       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
