Hi,
I would like to get the time delay that a packet suffers from the time it is
ready to be sent (with all the headers, TCP, IP, Ethernet...) till the time
the first byte of it is actually sent. I guess that for this, several steps
have to be done:
(1) the packet, which is stored in memory, has to get the bus mastership
(2) once it has the bus, it has to be sent to the Network Card
(3) at some time, the packet also has to wait for the network card to be
idle
(4) any other ... (?)
Can somebody give me some light on how this process is actually done and
what part of the code do I have to look at to put some timers and to get the
delays for each step?
I'm also interested in the upstream way, this is, the time that takes for a
packet which is in the network card to get into an sk_buff in the memory.
For the code that I should look at, I'm assuming that we are using and
ethernet card.
Thanks in advance.
Sincerely, Ziad Sayegh
