Odd, I can do a 'make menuconfig', do a /EARLY_PRINTK, and see:
 Symbol: EARLY_PRINTK [=y]                                               x  
  x Prompt: Early printk                                                    x  
  x   Defined at arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:33                                  x  
  x   Depends on: EMBEDDED                                                  x

Hey, I didn't make up that logic. ;)
A large percentage of the kernel config options are things that really *could*
be one way or the other for any given system.  Maybe you want ext4, maybe you
don't.  Maybe you need process accounting, maybe you don't.  So they don't go
under EMBEDDED.  But we can be 98% sure that they probably want PRINTK.
