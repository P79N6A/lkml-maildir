You mean the 'p' for pointer?  Well, loosely speaking, I guess you could
call it that.  Why do you ask?
Well ... I am not being straight forward.  I likely know why you ask.  I
find an occassional 'p' in a variable name to be helpful.  For example,
in this case, I am flipping between referring to the same datum by
reference and by value - so it is useful to reflect that distinction in
the variable names - it's _the_ key distinction.  If you wish to state a
case to the contrary, you're welcome to do so.

In certain cases, yes.  I had a version of these particular macros that
used inline logic instead, but this looked easier to read to my eye.  If
I spoke out against ifdef's carte blanche at some point (which likely I
did) then I was being incautious in my speaking.  The question is more
how best to make the code readable, maintainable, robust, fast and small.

Thank-you for your review comments.
