Wrap the reference to the parent task structure with exception table
recovery code, like copy_from_user().  If the dangling reference points
to valid memory the worst that will happen is that you read and report
gibberish for one output.  If the reference causes an exception then
recover and treat it as NULL.  For a read only case, the only important
thing is not to die, one occurrence of bad data is tolerable.
