| Yeah, Alan adds mm to the interfaces and leaves us the question of

Well, as I see, it seems the Alan's patch is correct. We pass
newly created mm to security_vm_enough_memory_mm() and get no errors
here even for overcommit = 2. But my question was that mm->total_vm
= 0 for this case and that is probably valid too I think. What about
the thing you pointed about? Well I think security_vm_enough_memory
should never be called from kernel thread (we have secrurity_vm_enough_memory_mm
for this). But I will check it more closely. Dont get me wrong - I'm not
VMM expert and may do errors ;)
