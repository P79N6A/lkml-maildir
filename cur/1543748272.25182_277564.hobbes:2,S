The real way I'd like to handle this is via hotplug.  The hotplug event
would transmit the HCTL in the environment.  Whether the drive actually
gets incorporated into the system and where is user policy, so it's
appropriate that it should be in userland.
This same infrastructure could be used by fibre channel login, scsi
enclosure events etc.
We have some of the hotplug infrastructure in SCSI, but not quite enough
for this ... you'll need an additional API.

Since The sysfs device name contains H:C:T:L surely you can just do a
find on /sys?
