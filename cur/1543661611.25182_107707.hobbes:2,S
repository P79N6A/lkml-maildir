They can change their licence agreement, but this relates to the
entire licence (e.g. switch from GPL to proprietary licence, but only
if they authored the GPL'd code.)  I am not sure of the difference
between purchase agreement and licence.  Retrospectively
adding/amending an existing licence when it has already been issued
with customers is another thing - it probably depends on what a court
is willing to allow.  As far as I know, there is little to go on when
trying to figure out if something is legal or within their rights or
not as far as software licences go.
One thing is for sure.  The law provides for copyright protection and
no more.  If something is outside the scope of copyright protection
*and there is no contract* (and a licence is *not* a contract) then
those licence agreements are not enforcable at law.  This is why
Microsoft's licences are not enforcable in a court of law (at least in
Australia anyway, I am not sure if they have been tested in court in
America.)

Then they must honour the GPL licence terms with respect to the GPL'd
code, and it is their responsibility to comply with this.
