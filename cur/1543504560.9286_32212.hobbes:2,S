[1.] One line summary of the problem:
cdrecord has problems under 2.3.12
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
cdrecord starts recording, and after some variable amount of time it
errors out.  See section 7.5 for program output at point of failure.  It
appears to my untutored eyes to be related to timing or buffering since
the program output says loss of streaming.  I made three coasters trying
to determine if the problem was with hardware or media.  Even with no
user processes running except cdrecord, the problem persisted.  Booting
back to a stock 2.2.10 appeared to solve the problem and allowed me to
record the cd.  Any pointers in diagnosing the problem would be
appreciated.
