I've got a couple of servers running 2.2 that have long rolled over (one
206 days ago and the other 314 days ago) without any trouble.  Another
six months and the second one will roll over a second time.  We're
looking at moving them to a new location, and I'm trying to figure out
how to splice an UPS in the power cord. :-)
