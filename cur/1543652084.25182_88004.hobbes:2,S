the crc32 table was defined because the same driver works for 2.4 
kernels, there we need our own crc32 implementation. I'll check if we 
can use the generic code in the kernel and then move the dvb_crc32 code 
into the 2.4 compatibility file compat.c
That the crc32 check is currently not called by the software 
demultiplexer is a known bug, it's already fixed in local CVS and will 
get into the kernel with the next patchset. I'm currently preparing this 
patchset but want to test it a little more.
Alan: do you have doubts or is there a reason not to apply the last 
patchset I sent you on Tue, 29 Oct 2002? (well - it was kind of huge, 
but all the namespace fixes and cleanups should justify the patch's 
size, not?)
