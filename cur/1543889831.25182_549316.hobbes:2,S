I guess how nasty or not it is depends on interval over which fairness
is expected. Longer the interval, better the scope to provide good fairness
based on load-balance schemes like sched-domain/smpnice ..

Basically, lets say that there are 2 CPUs, each with two threads
	    --------------------
	   |			|
	------              ---------
       i      i            i         i
     CPU0   CPU1         CPU2      CPU3
     
CPU0/1 and CPU2/3 are siblings.
Lets say that CPU0 has two or more tasks while CPU[1-3] are idle. Then the HT
optimizations in sched domains based load balancer ensures that CPU2 or
3 picks up one (or more) task from CPU0 rather than CPU1 picking it. The same
logic works at higher packaging levels (core, package, node? etc).
How would the virtual cpu scheduler achieve such optimizations? My
thought was such optimizations (if they have to be retained) has to be
introduced at virtual cpu schedule time ..?
Not just this, the sched domain based load balancer has other (nice?)
properties that it balances less frequently across nodes than across cpus
inside a node. This lets tasks execute longer on same node.
Essentially what I wanted to know was : what will be the role of sched
domain based load balancer on top of virtual cpu load balancer? Do you
disable sched domain based balancer completely? Or does it balance tasks 
across virtual cpus? Given that virtual cpus can run anywhere, then it needs 
to be significantly changed to understand that (for ex: the HT/MC
optimizations in sched domain balancer needs to becomes aware of this
virtual->physical cpu relationship).

Is this namespace different inside kernel context too?
To illustrate, consider my previous example:
       CONTAINER1 => VCPU0 + VCPU1
       CONTAINER2 => VCPU2 + VCPU3
Lets say that T1 in CONTAINER1 is running on VCPU0/PCPU0 at the same time 
that T2 in CONTAINER2 is running on VCPU2/PCPU1. As we discussed
earlier, they both can see themselves running on same (virtual) cpu 0. Lets say
they make system calls now and what does the kernel see this cpu id as
thr' smp_processor_id()? Hopefully it is different for the two threads
when they are inside kernel ..

Hmm ..what if some user space app maintains per-cpu stuff and (now that
we return same cpu id to both tasks running simultaneously on two different 
physical cpus) they collide writing to the the same per-cpu area?

I believe there is a syscall (vgetcpu?) in works to get a cpu id.

That may break other things. What if task had bound to (virtual) cpu0 and 
now its call to vgetcpu returns different values at different times,
based on where that virtual cpu0 was running at that moment!
IMHO introduction of virtual cpu for cases which require global cpu
id space will be a pretty complex thingy (both for user space and for
kernel). Not sure if it is worth the benefits.

Again it depends on the application I guess. Even under high load, it
may be the expectation of the user to run on same cpu for correctness
reasons.

Good example :) USER2's single task will have to share its CPU with
USER1's 50 tasks (unless we modify the smpnice load balancer to
disregard cpu affinity that is - which I would not prefer to do).
Ingo/Peter, any thoughts here?  CFS and smpnice probably is "broken" 
with respect to such example as above albeit for nice-based tasks.
