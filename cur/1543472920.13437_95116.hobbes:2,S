Reading from /dev/full gives bytes=0, error=ENOSPC, as recently reported 
(after I conflated it with another /dev/full I've seen somewhere).  A 
program which gets the same result from /dev/full as /dev/null is a program 
without proper error checking; a program which gets the same results from 
/dev/full as /dev/zero has a bug.
