If I'm not mistaken, the EeePC ACPI bios plays tricks with the USB ports 
during suspend/resume. You should really test suspend/resume with the same 
camera chipset on a proper computer. If the camera still crashes, we have a 
buggy chipset which needs a reset quirk. If it doesn't, the EeePC ACPI bios 
is probably at fault. Adding quirks and hacks to the Linux kernel (either in 
the USB stack or the uvcvideo driver) is pretty pointless if the bios tries 
to make the system crash. The ACPI code should be fixed in that case.
