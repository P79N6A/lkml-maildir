I'm not sure...but my guess is not. Who ever "just knows", could you
please submit a patch to Documentation/MSI-HOWTO.txt ?

Yes. Assuming the device supports multiple MSI-X messages.

Yes. One is allocating IRQ vectors from a finite number of vectors.
But this normally isn't a problem until one gets to larger machines that
have more than 4-8 PCI-e or PCI-X slots.
Typically, one will limit the number of vectors to the number of CPUs
in the system or to how many different events the device can signal.

pci_enable_msi() will fail if the system doesn't support MSI or something
else goes wrong with the call (e.g. already setup).
