Hi all,
I am trying to active bluetooth on a Vaio Picture Book C1-MZX
(
http://www.japanrush.com/pcg-c1mzx.asp
). 
I have first compiled bluetooth with the following options:
# Bluetooth support
#
CONFIG_BT=m
CONFIG_BT_L2CAP=m
# CONFIG_BT_SCO is not set
CONFIG_BT_RFCOMM=m
CONFIG_BT_RFCOMM_TTY=y
CONFIG_BT_BNEP=m
# CONFIG_BT_BNEP_MC_FILTER is not set
# CONFIG_BT_BNEP_PROTO_FILTER is not set
#
# Bluetooth device drivers
#
CONFIG_BT_HCIUSB=m
...
(the rest is set to "no")
Then, I followed this web page:
http://www.holtmann.org/linux/bluetooth/vaio.html
At the end, I have the following lsmod:
Module                  Size  Used by
hci_usb                11168  0

ac                      4812  0
Unfortunately, I have the following error message when trying to
activate the device (hciconfig hci0 up):
Can't get device info: No such device
And hciconfig -a doesn't give any output.
I have to add that I am using this with udev on my system (I don't know
if it is relevant to say it but as the system is complaining about a
missing device...).
Does anybody have some clue to get this to work ?
Regards
