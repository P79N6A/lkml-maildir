So _which_ case should abort read()?

Alexey, you are mixing files and descriptors. Look: you want to add some
strange state to the whole thing. Fine. Where should it live? If it's
associated with file - too bad, dup() will prevent aborting read() by
close(). If it's on descriptor - WTF does it have struct file?
