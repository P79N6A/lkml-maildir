I was under the impression that the problem in bkcvs was a design issue: it 
converted a BK repository to a CVS repository by creating a fresh CVS 
repository from scratch each time.  It didn't modify an existing CVS 
repository, which would be a bit more work.
It's not impossible, I suppose.  If you can feed bk the tree version that the 
old CVS was created against, there's existing logic to create create a 
gnu-style patch that gets the tree from point B to point C.  The only problem 
with creating a series of CVS entries instead of a patch is keeping the 
changes seperate when you do it...
Dunno how big a problem that is, I haven't looked at the BK source.  I'd like 
to keep my options open if I decide to work on subversion or some such in the 
future. :)
