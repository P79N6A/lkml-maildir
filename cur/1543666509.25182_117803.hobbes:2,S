Patch from Martin J. Bligh and Dave Hansen
People with ordinary PCs are accidentally turning on NUMA support,
and people with NUMA machines are finding the NUMA option mysteriously
disappearing. This patch sets the defaults to sane things for everyone,
and only allows you to turn on NUMA with both SMP and 64Gb support on
(it's useful for the distros on non-Summit boxes, but not on their UP
kernels ;-)). 
I've also moved it below the highmem options, as it logically depends
on them, so this makes more sense. For those searching for NUMA support
on *real* NUMA machine, Dave has provided some guiding comments to 
show them what they messed up (it's totally non-obvious).
Hopefully this will stop people's recent unfortunate foot-wounds
(I think UP machines were defaulting to NUMA on ... oops).
