I guess the one thing I really don't see supported here (apart from the
system/laptop joins the network after spawning a job which has been
mentioned) is restarting multiple simulatenous instances of a single
checkpoint.  In the pidspace approach, each restarted instance would
have a different pidspace id, but use the same vpids.  In the
preallocation scheme, only one pid has been reserved at checkpoint for
each process instance.
Is there a simple way to solve this?  (And how valid a concern is
this?  :)
Other than that, I guess your approach is growing on me...
