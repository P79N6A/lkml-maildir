Thanks - I had missed that - and it is a little cleaner to call it
"user" than "mount_uid" in the line in /proc/mounts, and there are no
existing parms returned that are similar (except "username" which should
be easy enough to understand). Interestingly I did not see other
filesystems returning that in /proc/mounts (I slightly prefer having it
stored in the filesystems kernel code and returned in showopts not just
put by userspace in the file mtab) - the only minor annoyance is that /
etc/mtab returns the username (rather than the uid).
