Unfortunately, the phone companies don't allow you to connect to
the network with uncertified hardware/driver combo's. Opening up
the ISDN development could bring all sorts of legal trouble with
it :(
At least, this is what I gathered from various sources. ISDN
development is just as opaque to me as it seems to be to you
so I could be very wrong on this one...
