Anand,
You need to send Petr the sources for the server namespace modules and
the NLS files so he can get his client working properly with all the
international character sets and NetWare clients.  He also needs some
help with NDS client support since he's trying to do something Novell
even has trouble with, which is support all the patch releases of 4.X
NDS with a single client.  WIth seeing a Network trace of the problem, I
am guessing the customer has a configuration problem and may be using
different release levels of 4.X NDS.  Also, when I was porting the
NetWare File System to NT in 1999, MS and I ran into all types of
problems with French and Italian unicode translation with characters
above 127, and asked Dana about it and he relayed some of these issues. 
You also need to get the NFS server up to modern levels so the
permissions "pipe" and "fifo" won't cause NetWare NFS to hang the server
after either ncpfs or nwfs write them into the namespace.  I've
discussed some of these issues with Craig Miller (your boss) and Dana
and they've been of some assistance.
Also, as per Eric Schmidt, you are not allowed to approach me or anyone
at TRG directly if you are a Novell employee unless Craig Miller or
Stewart Nelson have given you permission.  I think they are afraid I
might sue them again or something.  As such, I am copying Craig on this
email so he will know we are talking.  I don't think it will be a
problem, but TRG and Novell are both under a settlement consent decree,
so I have to follow the rules, and so do you.
:-)
