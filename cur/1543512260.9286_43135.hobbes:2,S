Great!!
   From the information I've seen, the best thing is probably to use a
   struct with two 32 bit values in it. Is there agreement in this area?
   If so, I'll start working this weekend.
Yup.  See the comments in /usr/src/linux/include/linux/kdev_t.h; there
are some fairly detailed design notes there.  Note the date on them:
