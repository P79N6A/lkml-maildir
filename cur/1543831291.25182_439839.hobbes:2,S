Have you looked at enabling write-intent bitmaps on your raid-1 arrays?
With all the grief I have been having with RAID-1 recently, bitmaps have saved 
me very very serious amounts of time resyncing the array.
Typically after my raid array has had devices/partitions kicked out (such as 
when loading -mm5) it takes only 2-3 seconds to bring each non-fresh 
device/partition back into the array and back up to sync (as opposed to 18 
hours...).
