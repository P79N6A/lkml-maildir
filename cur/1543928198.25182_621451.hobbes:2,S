Well, x86-32 and x86-64 are surprisingly similar here, for very 
different reasons (x86-64 is because there are only seven clobbered 
registers that aren't destroyed by the syscall instruction itself.)
However, on both of these we could make the user-space side cheaper, by 
making sure that we don't have to do additional copies in user space. 
For both these architectures, anything more than 3 parameters (i386) or 
6 parameters (x86-64) will be already in memory on the stack, so if we 
can use that image as-is then we at least save the intra-user-space copy 
that goes along with it.
x86-64 requires some minor thought, since the obvious way of doing it 
(using arg register 6 to push in a pointer) would end up with a 
discontiguous frame.  One can do it with something like this, although 
it's not clear to me it is a win at all (the more obvious sequence using 
XCHG isn't usable since XCHG locks unconditionally):
	pop	%r10			# Return address
	push	%r9			# Argument 6
	movq	%rsp, %r11
	push	%r10
	movq	%rcx, %r10
	syscall
	cmpq	$-4095, %rax
	jae	...
	pop	%r10
	pop	%r9
	push	%r10
	retq
The number of registers do vary, obviously, with s390 being the smallest 
number (5).

True, of course, although we're talking here about different ways to 
pull arguments out of userspace memory; *definitely* agreed with that we 
don't want to have any additional indirection necessary.
