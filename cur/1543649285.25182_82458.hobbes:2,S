Excellent - thanks for that ... will try it.

Well, it's a multi-gigabyte partition. IIRC, I just ran it until
it died with "input/output error" ... which I assumed at the time
was the end of the partition, but it should be able to find that
without error, so maybe it just ran out of ZONE_NORMAL ;-)

That'd make a lot of sense (to me, at least). I presume you mean
occupancy on a per-slab basis, not global.
