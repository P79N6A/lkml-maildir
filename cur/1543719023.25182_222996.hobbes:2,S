It's worse than that.  Way worse.
The speed of hard disks doesn't grow anywhere near as
fast as the size of memory and applications. This means
that over the last years, swapping in any particular
application has gotten SLOWER than it used to be ...
This means that even though the VM is way smarter than
it used to be, the visibility of any wrong decision has
increased.
I wonder if there's a way we could change the VM so it
could recover faster from any mistakes it made, instead
of trying to prevent it from making any mistakes (those
will happen anyway, the VM can't predict the future).
