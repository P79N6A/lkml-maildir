Hello Andrew,
thanks a lot for looking at this patch.

I should have read the latest version of SubmittingPatches :-(
I didn't expect you to pick up this patch so quickly, if I did
I'd have cleaned it more thoroughly. I apologize.
I expect this patch to go through a few more iterations in discussions
with Vivek and other people on this list.

OK. I thought this might make the patch itself too long, that's why I put
it into the header.
Thanks, Martin
