Messing about with conditional compilation because the link order is
incorrect is the wrong fix.  The mtd/Makefile must link the objects in
the correct order.
cfi_probe.o needs to come after cfi_cmdset_000?.o.
doc_probe.o needs to come after doc200?.o.
nora.o, octagon-5066.o, physmap.o, rpxlite.o, vmax301.o, pnc2000.o need
to come after cfi_probe.o.
octagon-5066.o, vmax301.o need to come after jedec.o.
octagon-5066.o, vmax301.o need to come after map_ram.o.
octagon-5066.o, vmax301.o need to come after map_rom.o.
2.4.0-test13-pre2 almost does that, the only obvious problem is that
cfi_probe appears before cfi_cmdset.  Move cfi_probe to link after
cfi_cmdset, do you still get link order problems with the 2.4.0-test11
version of include/linux/mtd.h?
