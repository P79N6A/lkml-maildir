Why is the normal load balance path not enough (or not be able to do the
right thing)?  The reblance_tick and idle_balance ought be enough to take
care of the imbalance.  What makes load balancing in wake up path so special?
Oh, I'd like to hear your opinion on what to do with these two flags, make
them runtime configurable? (I'm of the opinion to delete them altogether)
