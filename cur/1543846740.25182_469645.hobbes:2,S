Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: fix kernel panic in initialization of mpu401 driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I am getting kernel panic (NULL pointer dereference) on boot, with kernel 
compiled with CONFIG_SND_MPU401_UART=y, on machine which does not have 
this piece of hardware.
I have traced the problem down to 
sound/drivers/mpu401/mpu401.c:snd_mpu401_probe() returning EINVAL, when 
either port or IRQ parameters are not specified.
In such case, the drivers/base/bus.c:bus_attach_device() does not perform 
klist_add_tail() call, but rather sets dev->is_registered to 0. This flag 
is however not checked by the driver, so later on, when 
alsa_card_mpu401_init() is called and platform_device_register_simple() 
fails, the following callchain happens, causing NULL pointer dereference: 
alsa_card_mpu401_init() -> platform_device_unregister() -> 
platform_device_del() -> device_del() -> bus_remove_device() -> 
klist_del() -> BOOM (the entry was not added to klist in 
bus_attach_device()).
Proper solution is returning ENODEV from the ->probe() routine, which will 
be correctly handled then by the rest of the device-driver attaching 
subsystem (namely the retval check in bus_attach_device()). The following 
patch fixes the problem, please apply.
Patch against current Linus' git tree.
