Yes, it seems that too many real-world applications are accidentally
triggering this problem.
Could you please run an strace of the boosted process, find out what it is
doing to get itself boosted in this manner?  Wait until things are in
steady state and the process is boosted, then run `strace -tt <pid>' so we
see the timing info.
Thanks.
