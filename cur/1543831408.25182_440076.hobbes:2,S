Please consider UPEK reader.
It is available on all new Thinkpad laptops, and the vendor provides
only binary drivers.

I hate when vendors like ATI, Conexant and UPEK publish binary drivers
without publishing the chipset spec... They should decide whether
their IP is on the software part or on the hardware part, if it is on
the hardware part, they are making money in selling the hardware. If
it is on the software part, there is no reason why not providing the
information for others to write software to work with the primitive
hardware. So in either case there should be full hardware interface
disclosure.
Best Regards and Goodluck!
