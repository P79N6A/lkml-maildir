He is using XF4.0.2 with Matrox large-blob driver, not with XFree one.
I'm 111% sure that this module contains code which is not freely 
available to mortals.
XFree4.0.2 mga driver does not work with G450 at all. I'm not sure whether
you (or RedHat) applied G450 patches flying around. But it is still first
head only, no digital LCD...
