Sure.
Although, an (almost) equivalent userspace code would be:
mount_fooat(int fd, const char *path)
{
	char tmpbuf[64];
	int tmpfd = openat(fd, path);
	sprintf(tmpbuf, "/proc/self/fd/%i", tmpfd);
	return mount_foo(tmpbuf, ...);
}
Or is there something (other than not requiring proc) that the *at
variant gives?
