The change is a small one and both the cost and benefit aren't big.

I'm in full agreement here but the cost / benefit equation doesn't seem
quite right to me.  If we're gonna convert all callbacks to take native
pointers, I'm fine with the irq handler part too.  If not, it just adds
confusion which is much worse than any benefit it can bring, so I think
the question is "do we want to change all callbacks to take native
pointer type instead of void pointer?".
