well, deadline is a little bit better. I'm trying to read from disk opening
maildir with 20000 mails with mutt. If I open that maildir, mutt shows
progress. With cfq or anticipatory scheduler, progress is 0/20000 until scp
finishes. With deadline, progress is 150/20000 after scp finished. So I would
say, it is better but I doubt it is OK.
