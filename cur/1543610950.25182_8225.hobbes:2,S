Could you quickly explain an use case where it makes a difference if 
CPU affinity settings for multiple processes are done atomically or not ? 
The only way to make CPU affinity settings of processes really atomically 
without a "consolidation window" is to
do them before the process starts up. This is easy when they're inherited --
just set them for the parent before starting the other processes. This 
works with any interface; proc based or not as long as it inherits.
