 Hi,
AMD's CodeAnalyst is the right tool for you.  It is based on Oprofile.
It can be free downloaded from AMD website.
Best Regards

Subject: Hardware Perfromance Counters
Hello everyone,
The system I am working on is a single processor Athlon. In the kernel I need to detect a cache miss (L1/L2) and trigger an event/function (inside the kernel). Now we have performance counters for detecting/counting cache misses. Among the various tools/patches available for accessing performance counters, which one do you guys recommend. Or do you think it would be easy to write code for this myself, as i just need this one event detection. Can you give some links where one can read about programming performance counters or some book on it.
Thanks a lot.
please cc reply to me too.
