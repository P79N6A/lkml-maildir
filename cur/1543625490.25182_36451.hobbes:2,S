Hello Oleg,
I just re-created the questionable fs (both) with a freshly compiled
util-package (reiserfsprogs-3.x.1b) and now things are even more weird:
It now works, depending on which fs I mount first. Remeber both are completely
new 3.6 fs. I can really reproduce mounting "a", then "b" works, but first
mounting "b", then "a" has the problem. Did you try something like this (play
with the mounting sequence)?
Regards,
Stephan
