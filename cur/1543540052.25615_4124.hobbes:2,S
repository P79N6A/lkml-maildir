   If $$MODLIB already exists and is a directory, you'll be creating a
   link inside that directory which is probably not what you want.
   Perhaps:
     test -e $$MODLIB/build || ln -s `pwd` $$MODLIB/build
Umm, did you notice the "rm -f" command before the "ln -s"?  
This was to take care of the case where $$MODLIB/build exists, but
doesn't (necessarily) point to the right place.  In your suggested case,
if $$MODLIB/build is present by points to the wrong location, it won't
get fixed.
