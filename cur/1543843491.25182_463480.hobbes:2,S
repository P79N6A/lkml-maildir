To explicitly send things through a specific interface, you need to use 
some magic, like PF_RAW. ping for example is one program that will do 
this (-I option).

One cannot have the same subnet on multiple interfaces, because ARP 
queries will only be sent through the first one. You need br0 (or bond0 
- depending on how you plan to plan your network) to make them one 
interface.
