Hmm.. I don't know why. I'm using x86 cpu machine.

Ah, sorry for quite insufficiency explanation.
Since INITIAL_JIFFIES is -5 minutes, so I though tv.tv_nsec should be 0.
The cause of this is
     INITIAL_JIFFIES % HZ (4294667296 % 1000)
because INITIAL_JIFFIES is unsigned long.
So, I guessed this is not intention.
Looks like this should be (-300*1000) % 1000.
What do you think of this?
