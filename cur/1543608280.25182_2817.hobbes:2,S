That might simply be the inclusion of various "freeware" packages --
shells, gzip, apache, samba, and so forth, not necessarily kernel code.
All of those packages come with full source as well, so they should be
compliant with the GPL if that's how they happen to be licensed.
Of course, the line should probably be connected to Solaris 8, since
that's when most of these things started shipping with it.
