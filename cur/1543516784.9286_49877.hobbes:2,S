Well sometimes they are but not always. Some times a driver needs to schedule 
of some tasks at a later time without resorting to using interrupts. Linux
does this by two ways, task queues and kernel timers. They are useful when
writing interrupt handlers. Kernel timers are used to run at a specific
time later. Usually task queues are used to manage hardware that can't
generate interrupts but still allows blocking read. You need to poll the
device but yet not eat up the CPU with unnecessary operations. So a task
queue are used to store task to run at a later time. Take a look at
/usr/include/linux/tqueue.h for more details. 
 Bottom half handlers are half of a interrupt handler. Most interrupt
handlers schedule part of their work to be executed when task queues are
run. Why is it half a interrupt handler? Well a interrupt task could be
very long. So linux splits the interrupt handler into two halves. The top
halve is the routine you register with request_irq and teh bottom half
("bh") is a routine that is scheduled by the top half to be run later when
it will be "safe". This means other interrupts can run while the bottom
half is executed including another interrupt of the same kind. The top
half is usually very very fast. Usually filling a data buffer and marks it
bottom half and then exits. So you can see a bottom half is very similar
to a task queue. So you ask what the difference is? Task queues are always
dynamic while bottom halves are limited in number and predefined in the
kernel. Of course bottom halves have now evolved in time from a static
nature to a dynamic nature with the use of task queues. As you can see 
task queues actually evolved from bottom half handlers. Note bottom halves 
exist as a array of function pointers and a bitmask. Thats why you can't
have more than 32 of them. Look at <linux/interrupt.h> for more info.
