Because IRIX has certain design flaws doesn't mean the entire OS is 
crap. I have heard nothing but good things about XFS.

  I'm not talking about implementing Thread-private mappings for the
entire system. What I have done is when the process mmaps the accel region
set a flag. This way if the process creates new threads or forks it will
have a private mapping. The impact of private mapping is thus minimized.
Once a process unmaps the accel region the flag is turned off. The only
way preformance can be killed on the system is if the process that
mmapped the accel region creates a bunch of threads and none of the 
threads use the accel region. I just don't see that happening. Also how
many threads will a well designed OpenGL library have. You don't want to
go crazy here creating a bunch of threads. 
  The question we have to ask why do we want private mapping. The reason 
DRE (Direct Rendering Engine) needs this is to ensure a page fault
happens. If you don't want private mapping for thread in this case then
tell me a way to ensure every thread or forked process that uses the 
accel engine page faults. Why do you need a page fault? Because the page
fault is what I used to serialize access to the accel engine on SMP
machines and to save and restore the graphics context. As Jon Leech
pointed out each threads need to refer to *different* graphics contexts. 
OpenGL is based on the graphics pipeline. Ideally each part of the
pipeline would be used by a different process. Say we have SMP machine 
with one video card. Ideally a different process on each CPU would be in
different places in the graphics pipeline. The problem is one thread 
could have the hardware in a state that could alter the desired results
for the other threads since the other threads most likely need the
hardware in another state. 
  Also as Jon pointed out the API requires that these contexts be 
identified by some thread-specific mechanism available to the graphics
library, not by explicit stack pointers in the application. Either
the threaded OpenGL API is broken or DRE for linux-SGI is. If this the
case then linux will need its own special threaded OpenGL library
compared to all the other platforms which don't require this special 
rewrite.

So are you suggesting if anyone wants to program DRE to have a
README.nothreads warning file. Also we should have to rewrite the native
threaded OpenGL library for SGI machines to use just fork instead of
easly porting over to linux-SGI.

One I'm suggesting this only for process that mmap the accel region not
the entire system. The ratio of these special private mapped for DRE 
with OpenGL to total shared threads in the system will be small. 
Second the small performace decrease for private mapping threads in DRE 
is worth it for stability on SMP machines. Its along the same lines as 
having a virtual file system. If you wanted maximum performace from a 
hard driver you could just write and read from the hard driver directly.
Instead we have virtual filesystem that provides stablility and security
in a mulituser SMP machine.

All I do inside fork that if the process creating children mmaped the
accel region be treated as a regular fork even if its a thread.
The bottom line is once the code is done I will test to see how it
compares to the other graphics soultions out. If DRE is a poorer soultion
then DRE will die away. If not then it should become the standard way to
handle graphics in linux.
