Well right now we set it to 32...
I think out-of-the-box Linux, with SMP set, should support the maximum
number of CPUs.  While we do save some memory I do not think it is going
to be huge with 8 vs 32.
But whatever you, Linus, and the arch maintainers say... all my boxen
are 2-way so I don't care ;)

Or ask Andrew...
