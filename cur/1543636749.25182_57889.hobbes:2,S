Hi,
include/linux/input.h:457:1: warning: "KEY_PLAY" redefined
include/linux/input.h:310:1: warning: this is the location of the previous 
definition
include/linux/input.h:461:1: warning: "KEY_FASTFORWARD" redefined
include/linux/input.h:311:1: warning: this is the location of the previous 
definition
I don't know which keys are correct, but currently KEY_PLAY is defined to 
407, and KEY_FASTFORWARD is 411. We previously defined them to 207/208.
