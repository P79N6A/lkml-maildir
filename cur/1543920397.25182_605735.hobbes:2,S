PREFETCH* doesn't change program semantics. The processor is allowed to 
ignore prefetch instruction if it doesn't have resources needed for 
prefetch. It not ordered wrt. fences.
PREFETCHNTA was implemented as prefetch into L1 cache and omitting L2 
cache on Pentium 3 and M --- and it is implemented as prefetch into L2 
cache on other --- do it doesn't really use any special buffers.
