Update: We (Google) set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retrans_collapse to "0"
on our webservers.  Now, instead of a kernel panic, they seem to
spontaneously reboot without any errors or explanation in
/var/log/messages.  For us, this is a significant improvement over the
previous sitation: at least we don't have to manually reboot them.  But
it still leaves unanswered the question of what is causing it.
It also seems that the reboots are now happening significantly less
often than the crashes did.
Any suggestion on how we can collect more information about why the
machines are rebooting?
