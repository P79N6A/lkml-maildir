Well, the .modinfo section should only be generated for objects build as 
modules, not into the kernel. So it very much likes some object has been 
compiled with -DMODULE, though it gets linked into the kernel.
(Which one is it? Obviously it has MODULE_PARM(minor/flash_base/size) in 
it)

Well, discarding .modinfo would only hide errors like this, so I wouldn't 
think it's a good idea.
