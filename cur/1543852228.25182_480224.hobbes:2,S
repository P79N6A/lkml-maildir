nice!
small detail: i'm wondering why 'distance' is needed explicitly? The 
dependency graph as it is represented by locks_after should be a full 
representation of all locking dependencies. What is the intended 
definition of 'distance' - the distance from the root of the dependency 
tree? (Maybe i'm misunderstanding what you are trying to achieve.)
