thanks for testing it! (for the record, Gene tested sched-mike-4.patch, 
which is Mike's patch from 4 days ago.)

this is pretty hard to get right, and the most objective way to change 
it is to do it testcase-driven. FYI, interactivity tweaking has been 
gradual, the last bigger round of interactivity changes were done a year 
ago:
 commit 5ce74abe788a26698876e66b9c9ce7e7acc25413
 Author: Mike Galbraith <efault@gmx.de>

     [PATCH] sched: fix interactive task starvation
(and a few smaller tweaks since then too.)
and that change from Mike responded to a testcase. Mike's latest changes 
(the ones you just tested) were mostly driven by actual testcases too, 
which measured long-term timeslice distribution fairness.
It's really hard to judge interactivity subjectively, so we rely on 
things like interbench (written by Con) - in which testsuite the 
upstream scheduler didnt fare all that badly, plus other testcases 
(thud.c, game_sim.c, now massive_inter.c, fiftyp.c and chew.c) and all 
the usual test-workloads. This is admittedly a slow process, but it 
seems to be working too and it also ensures that we dont regress in the 
future. (because testcases stick around and do get re-tested)
your system seems to also be a bit special because you 1) drive it to 
the absolute max on the desktop but you do not overload it in obvious 
ways (i.e. your workloads are pretty fairly structured) 2) it's a bit 
under-powered (single-CPU 800 MHz CPU, right?) but not _too_ 
underpowered - so i think you /just/ managed to hit 'the worst' of the 
current interactivity estimator: with important tasks both being just 
above and just below 50%. Believe me, on all ~10 systems i use 
regularly, Linux interactivity of the vanilla scheduler is stellar. (And 
that includes a really old 500 MHz one too with FC6 on it.)
