I think the problem is that any block_write_full_page(WB_SYNC_NONE)
that hits a page that has a buffer in process of being written will
get PageWriteback cleared even though the i/o has not completed.
(The buffer will be locked, but buffer_dirty() is cleared, so
 __block_write_full_page() will SetPageWriteback(); unlock_page();
 see no buffer were submitted and call end_page_writeback())
Any subsequent filemap_write_and_wait() or filemap_fdatawrite() /
filemap_fdatawait will never wait for that i/o.  So this could
potentially be a problem for more than just DIO.
BTW: 2.4 __block_write_full_page() always did a lock_buffer(), so
it waits for i/o in flight.
I agree though, it would be best if non-sync __block_write_full_page()
would not block on buffers in flight.  Somehow we need to move the
clearing of PageWriteback() until after the buffer has been written
even for the case where ll_rw_block() is called.
Thoughts?
