Before I get writing, I want to be clear on what tests are considered
useful.

Would tiobench --threads be suitable or would the IO skew what you are
looking for? If the IO is a problem, what would you recommend instead?

Is running a kernel build over NFS reasonable? Should it be a remote NFS
server or could I setup a NFS share and mount it locally? If a kernel
build is not suitable, would tiobench over NFS be a better plan?

If it was expensive in absolute performance, then the aim9 figures would
have suffered badly and kbuild would also be hit. It has never been shown
that the list-based approach incurred a serious performance loss.
Similarly, I have not been able to find a performance loss with zone-based
unless it kernelcore was a small number. As both approaches reduce
fragmentation in a way without a measurable performance loss, I disagree
that defragmentation is "useless simply because for big areas it is so
expensive as to be impractical".
For "big areas", the issue is how big. When list-based was last released,
peoples view of "big" was the size of a bank of memory that was about to
be physically removed. AFAIK, that scenario is not as important as it was
because it comes with a host of difficult problems.
The scenario people really care about (someone correct me if I'm wrong
here) for hot-remove is giving virtual machines more or less memory as
demand requires. In this case, the "big"  area of memory required is the
same size as a sparsemem section - 16MiB on the ppc64 and 64MiB on the x86
(I think). Also, for hot-remove, it does not really matter where in the
zone the chunk is, as long as it is free. For ppc64, 16MiB of contiguous
memory is reasonably easy to get with the list-based approach and the case
would likely be the same for x86 if the value of MAX_ORDER was increased.
Both list-based and zone-based give the large chunks that could be
removed, but with list-based memory can be added that is usable by the
kernel and zone-based can only give more memory for userspace processes.
If the workload requires more kernel memory, you are out of luck.
The ideal would be bits of both would be available but I find it difficult
to believe that will ever make it it. I believe that list-based is better
overall because it's flexible and it helps both kernel and userspace.
However, it affects the main allocator code paths and it was greeted with
a severe kicking. Zone-based is less invasive, more predictable, probably
has a better chance of getting in, but it requires careful tuning and the
kernel cannot use hot-added memory at run-time.
I'd prefer the list-based approach to make it in, but zone-based is better
than nothing.

One distinction is that memory reserved for huge pages is not the same as
memory placed in ZONE_EASYRCLM. Critically, pages in ZONE_EASYRCLM cannot
be used by the kernel for slabs, buffer pages etc. On the x86, this is not
a big issue because ZONE_HIGHMEM cannot be used anyway, but on
architectures that can use all memory (or at least large portions of it)
they would use ZONE_NORMAL, it is a big problem.

Right now, they are the main reasons for needing low fragmentation.
