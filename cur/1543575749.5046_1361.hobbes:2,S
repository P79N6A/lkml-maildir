hi all,
i'm using test12 to perform a clean linux install.  as soon as i get to
a command prompt, ps axufw shows swapper at 99.8% CPU usage.  this
didn't repro with test11, and doesn't repro if i don't use an initrd.
my load avg stays above 1 even if nothing [a couple gettys and a shell]
is running.
what can i do to debug this?  any ideas?
