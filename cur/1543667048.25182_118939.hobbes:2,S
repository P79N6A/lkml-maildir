I know it's already been said, but IMHO it needs to be underscored.  Local
root holes are just a simple non-root remote exploit away from being
remotely exploitable root holes.  Both are often considered
insignificant, and that is scary!  As far as fileutils...couldn't agree
more ;-)  But that doesn't make a locally exploitable root hole in the
kernel any less significant.
