..and? I'm using this NIC family with this driver in all my diskless setups 
with kernels since 2.0.* up to 2.4.20, and I never experienced the problem
you describe, so I would check for some hardware, bios, chipset, cable, hub
or switch problem.
From about 30 NICs currently in production for 6 month up to 5 years, I had 
one failure (3c905b). I haven't found Don's driver failing since ages ;-), 
through the b versions created me some headaches for etherbooting and the
newest 3c905cx-txm has a problem with software bootprom flashing :-(.
