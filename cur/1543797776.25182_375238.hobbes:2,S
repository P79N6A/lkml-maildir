If it's easily repeatable, doing a "git bisect" to see when it starts 
happening is the obvious big sledge-hammer thing to try. Even if you don't 
bisect all the way, just narrowing it down a bit more might help.
Also, enabling DEBUG_PAGEALLOC might help, but that's not available on 
powerpc.
There's a raid1 use-after-free bugfix that I just merged and pushed out, 
but I doubt that one is relevant. But you might try to update.
