I'll use bugzilla to report any problems with 2.6.13-rc6.
But since I've included the "usb-handoff" option at boot time,
all my problems (except the long dhcp/eth0 connect time) are
now gone.  Right now I'm using 2.6.13-rc5.
I understand the need to pinpoint the kernel version, but the
"usb-handoff" option has even corrected some problems that
started in linux-2.4.x.  For example, my PS/2 mouse now functions
normally.  It has not worked with this motherboard since some time
in the 2.4.x series.  Also, my keyboard lights were malfunctioning
under X-Window since early 2.6.x, but with the "usb-handoff" option
they are working normally now.
If I had known about the "usb-handoff" option earlier, this thread 
probalby would not even have come into existence.  As long as "usb-handoff"
keeps working, I would consider the issue closed.
