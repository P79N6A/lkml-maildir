You probably need to just load ip_conntrack_standalone and make sure it runs.
It has a higher priority than ipchains in the prerouting chain and should just defragment 
things. 
Better would it be to just write a small netfilter module with a higher
priority than ipchains that always defrags. 
Actually I thought I've once seen such a beast, but it doesn't seem to
be included in the main kernel now that I look for it.  It's all only a few 
lines of code anyways.
