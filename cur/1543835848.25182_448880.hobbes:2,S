I know you can't use huge pages if your physical address is not
properly aligned.   Which can be a performance impact if nothing else.
Not something I want to encourage in a general purpose kernel. 
If it is actually a problem once we get past the user confusion
aspect of this I will happily revisit it.  The big confusion in all of
this is that with a 4MB alignment and a 1MB offset the useable cases
are: 1MB, 5MB, 9MB, 13MB, 17MB, 21MB... 
What I did that is rather unique is I actually enforce this in misc.c
so there is no way we can slip by our alignment requirements.
I'm not terribly comfortable with the 8K alignment number as we only
tell the linker we need 4K alignment.  So there might be other
implicit things out there as well.  Although I admit head.S may be
the only place we can get away with that kind of thing, as the linker
can move everything else around.  Groan yet another kernel audit if
we go this route.

Yes. I have that check.  Except now the check really is
(CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START & 0x1FFFFF) == 0 because the x86_64 kernel lives at
2MB by default now, so it can really get the benefit of huge pages.

( As opposed to the unuseable CVS I presume :)
I guess I should just post them so we can have a sane conversation :)
