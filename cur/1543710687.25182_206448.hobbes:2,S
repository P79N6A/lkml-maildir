A different but related problem: rsync cannot backup my kernel
development directory from one hard disk to another, because it
contains lots of kernel trees mostly hard linked to each other.  rsync
falls over, trying to keep track of the roughly half a million links.
You might see similar problems trying to backup a strongly "copyfile"'d
filesystems.
