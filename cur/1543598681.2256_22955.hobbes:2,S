Nobody except for a few really obscure drivers use SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM
with their interrupt handlers (none on ppc as far as I can see) On
i386 all the gathering is normally done via the keyboard/mouse drivers
and the blk interface. The reason e.g. Macs normally do not gather
entropy is that they're using the new input layer for keyboard and
mouse which for some reason doesn't feed its events into the entropy
pool. I believe Wojtech did a patch for it, but I don't know if it has
been merged into the ppc tree yet.
