NeXT had something like this. You could open a file as memory mapped.
They also had things called streams and Named Streams that were 
sort of like pipes but could be to memory buffers or files or
whatever.
It was not built into the kernel though, it was all libc (or libNeXT)
stuff in userland. Still, with the good VM stuff they had, mapped
files and streams worked well.
It was some very powerful stuff. You should get some old manuals
and look into it.
