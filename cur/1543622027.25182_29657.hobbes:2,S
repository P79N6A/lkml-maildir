I also used to receive that error with ide-scsi, but it turns out I had
just forgotten to add SCSI-generic support, which is required to use
cdroms through ide-scsi for some reason.

I got this problem also. Similar config, ATAPI Plextor CDRW using
ide-scsi.
The system would refuse to read/mount CDs unless I did it as root. (eg,
cds wouldn't mount, cdparanoia wouldn't work) Upgrading to -rc2-ac1
seems
to have "fixed" it, have you tried -rc2? (I should try to figure out why
after class, when I actually have time :3 )
