Subject: [PATCH] another minor bit of cpumask cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ingo Oeser pointed out to me in private email that one of the cpumask
macros was broken - the macro for for_each_online_cpu() starts its loop
with _any_ cpu from the provided mask, and only worries about restricting
itself to _online_ cpus when looping to the next cpu:
include/linux/cpumask.h:
> #define for_each_online_cpu(cpu, map)                                   \
>         for (cpu = first_cpu_const(mk_cpumask_const(map));              \
>                 cpu < NR_CPUS;                                          \
>                 cpu = next_online_cpu(cpu,map))
Looking further, I see this macro is never used, and its subordinate
inline macro next_online_cpu() used no where else.  What's more, it's
redundant.  Calling it with a map of "cpu_online_map" (which you have to
do, given it's broken thus) is just as good as calling the macro right
above, "for_each_cpu()", with that same "cpu_online_map". Indeed the
only uses of "for_each_cpu()", in arch/i386/mach-voyager/voyager_smp.c,
do pass "cpu_online_map" explicitly, in 5 of 6 calls there from.
So, having found a piece of code that is broken, redundant and unused,
I hereby off the following patch to remove it.
Thank-you, Ingo.
