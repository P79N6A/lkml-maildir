Ever heard of TCP checksums? Ever heard of ethernet checksums? Which
transport doesn't use checksums nowadays? The digest makes only sense if
you can generate it for free in hardware or for debugging, otherwise
it's only a waste of cpu time. This makes the complete ERL 1 irrelevant
for a software implementation. With block devices you can even get away
with just ERL 0 to implement transparent recovery.
bye, Roman
