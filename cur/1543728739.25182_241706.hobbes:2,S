Pass in a pointer to the struct pci_dev ->dev structure.  Something
like &pci_dev->dev should work well.  Then you will see the "device"
symlink show up in your class device directory in sysfs, which makes
tools like udev much easier to use.

Not needed, as it should be pulled from the fops structure.

Not needed anymore.

You might want to move the class_simple_add_device() line after the
cdev_add line, just to handle the error conditions easier.
Other than those minor things, this looks good.
