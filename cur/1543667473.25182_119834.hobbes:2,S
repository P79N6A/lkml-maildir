Hi All
I am trying to find the gethostbyname() equivalent function in kernel space. 
Does any one know that.
The reason is...
I am using UDP to transfer data from one machine to another. It is not one 
time transfer. Once I get a message from machine A; I need to send some 
message back to Machine A from Machine B. For that I was using the following 
lines in user space program. I need to do the same in kernel space. Could 
any one help me out in this.
struct hostent *data;
struct sockaddr_in server;
int sock;
  sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM , 0)
/* binding and all are done here */
  data = gethostbyname("158.168.1.1");
  memcpy (&server.sin_addrs, data->h_addr, data->h_length);
  retval = sendto(sock,msg,sizeof(msg), 0, (struct sockaddr *) &server, 
sizeof server);
Thanking You
Shesha
