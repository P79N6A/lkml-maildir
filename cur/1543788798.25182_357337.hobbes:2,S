I was rather expecting that the various groups which are interested in
crash dumping would converge around kdump once it was merged.  But it seems
that this is not the case and that work continues on other strategies.
Is that a correct impression?  If so, what shortcoming(s) in kdump are
causing people to be reluctant to use it?
