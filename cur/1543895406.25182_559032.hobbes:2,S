You are wrong.  Look in unix_release_sock():
	if (atomic_read(&unix_tot_inflight))
		unix_gc();		/* Garbage collect fds */
unix_tot_inflight is the number of AF_UNIX sockets currently being
transferred over some AF_UNIX sockets.
That means that just sending (non-unix socket) fds over unix sockets
will never invoke the gc.
