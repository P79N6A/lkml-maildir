From: Bryan O'Sullivan <>
Subject: [PATCH 1 of 2] Introduce __raw_memcpy_toio32
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/11/424

This arch-independent routine copies data to a memory-mapped I/O region,
using 32-bit accesses.  It does not guarantee access ordering, nor does
it perform a memory barrier afterwards.  This style of access is required
by some devices.
