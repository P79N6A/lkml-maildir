   Let's be accurate: both fat and ext2 CAN use serial numbers. However,
   neither is forced to, and certainly with fat partitions, there are
   plenty that don't have any serial numbers in place - any formatted
   prior to MSDOS 6.00 and never reformatted, for example.

   SCT is probably far more au fait with ext2 tools than I am...
Actually, if you're a version of e2fsprogs newer than 1.05 (and if
you're using anything that old, you've got other really serious problems
problems), e2fsck will automatically generate and assign a UUID to a
filesystem that doesn't have one.
So we can pretty much count on all ext2 filesystems have a UUID.  The
only time it won't be unique is if someone copies a filesystem using
dd.  This admittedly does happen with floppies from time to time, but
there's not much we can do to prevent that.

   Personally, I believe they are so high that anything that can't give a
   rock solid guarantee that it has correctly identified the disk that
   was removed shouldn't even be considered.
Well, if the UUID is different from what filesystem was mounted
previously, that's a guarantee that we *should* do soemthing.  Yes,
there is some chance of type II errors, but it's not like there's any
chance of a type I error.  That means that it really can be a useful
test.
