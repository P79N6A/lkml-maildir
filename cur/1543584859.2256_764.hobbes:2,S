Hello,
make bzImage gives this:
ld: cannot open drivers/net/pcmcia/pcmcia_net.o: No such file or
directory
with the following .config:
#
# PCMCIA network device support
#
# CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA is not set
CONFIG_PCMCIA_NETCARD=y  
I'm not sure how the 'CONFIG_PCMCIA_NETCARD=y' got set as my `make
config` only shows:
*
* PCMCIA network device support
*
PCMCIA network device support (CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA) [N/y/?] 
Hmm, I did a `make config` again and just presed 'enter' on all of the
lines and the CONFIG_PCMCIA_NETCARD=y was no longer in my .config -
though it still is in my .config.old.
It's late, maybe it was me - but I don't believe so...
(I do notice that CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA is in arch/i386/defconfig. Perhaps
it should not be)
