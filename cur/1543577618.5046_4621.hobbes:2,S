A 2.4.0.1 should be on ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/crypto/v2.4/. But
it has been heavily re-worked. I haven't got my hands on that one and
will keep quiet as to what extend that patch is produiction-ready, but I
remember that the loop driver in 2.4.0 still can stall your box. Since
the kerneli crypto relies on loop, this would count in favor of "don't
do that yet".
BTW: You might want to join linux-crypto@nl.linux.org (majordomo) if you
are interested in kerneli.
