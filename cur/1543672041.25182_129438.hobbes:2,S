What happens if the ASCII-armor area is full, i.e. sum(PROT_EXEC sizes)

Thanks. However, that brings me to the next question:
01000000-01004000 r-xp 00000000 16:01 2036120    /home/mingo/cat-lowaddr
I was wondering why the executable parts of the binary start at the 16
MB boundary. Is this always the case or just something that happens with
cat? In the first case, that would be bad for any binary with a
contiguous executable area bigger than 64K.
Thanks for answering,
Carl-Daniel
