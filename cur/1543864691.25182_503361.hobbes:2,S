I have two problems. First suspend to disk.
After suspend to disk (before resume) I check time in bios, and it's
correct, but during resume, I have this message:
"Suspending console(s)"
system wait 20 seconds (or more) until finish resume. Also system clock
was slow about this 20 seconds.
Second problem, power button doesn't work. When I pressed it, I has this
error:
ACPI Error (evevent-0305): No installed handler for fixed event
[00000002] [20070126]
