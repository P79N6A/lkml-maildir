It's me again. And I have bad news.
I have figured why it works for you and did not worked for me.
Try following patch (inspired by Ingo) to get nice BUG on bootup again.
Without the patch ext2 works with your fixes, but reiserfs is not working,
so it seems there are constant preempt counter underflows that later gets
corrected.
