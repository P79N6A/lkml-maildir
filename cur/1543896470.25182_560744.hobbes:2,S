Yep, this one-liner solves all acpi related compile errors/warnings
that I've reported.
Additional it resolves anoter problem that results from
dependencies between CONFIG_PNP and CONFIG_ACPI.
One problem arises:
If PM is deselected, the PNP menu is empty on x86_64.
So I suggest to add the attached patch to hide the PNP-menu
if no PM (and thus ACPI) is selected.
Regards,
Andreas
--
Make CONFIG_PNP a menuconfig to hide the submenu if neither
ISA nor ACPI is selected.
