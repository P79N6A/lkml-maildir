On a related note, if one would, say, rewrite csum_and_copy to use DMA HW
based copying + IP checksumming, one would want to sleep the process until
the DMA is finished (and not busy wait for the DMA). If the above is ok,
is it also safe to explicitely sleep the process (like, sleeping on a
waitqueue awoken by the DMA done IRQ), and would it work on 2.0 (non-SMP)?
