Note that the function that started this thread weren't removed with nwfs
in mind - in fact I doubt anyone here has seen the module or it's
requirements.
Arjan and I have produced lists of unused exported symbols and went through
the list what made sense and what not, and these exports were up high on the
doesn't make sense and any use we could imagine would be harmfull list.
The explained use only seconds that opinion - it has caused constant trouble
for years where IBM has been pushing the big distros to relax VFS sanity
checks and add additioal exports for their totally broken kernel driver.
That no beeing enough I know of at least two propritary Unix variants where
it cause exactly the same trouble.
