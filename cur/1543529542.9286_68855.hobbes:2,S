I just made a quick test prog using statfs.
You appear to be right, at least for /proc and /dev/pts.  Both have a
f_bsize field of 1024 and f_blocks of -1, so df shouldn't be showing
those.  /var/shm, though, has f_bsize of 4096 and f_blocks of 1048576
(thus the 4gig figure from df).  So maybe both is abit wrong ;)
