That's ok (right now). Application of it should only be considered after
discussion here and after the maintainer responds.

Should I have sent the first two patches to linux-kernel, the ATM SAR to
linux-atm-general and the SpeedTouch driver to linux-usb-devel?
How should I have handled the fact that the SpeedTouch and ATM SAR
patches depend on main kernel patches and the fact that the SpeedTouch
patch includes ATM code (since it is for an ATM device attached to the
USB bus)?
