AFAICS, most of memory related problems in darcs are not necessarily a
result of using Haskell.

With those languages, you often have no other choice than resorting to
C. GHC is quite a good compiler and I've often been able to get my
programs run almost as fast as programs written in C++ - however, if I
were to write those programs in C++, I would never do that, despite
being quite a good C++ programmer.
Also, in Haskell you can use extensions written in C, as easily or even
easier than in Python or Perl (I've done this in Perl, heard the battle
stories about C extensions in Python). Haskell's FFI is quite good,
there are also many supporting tools.
