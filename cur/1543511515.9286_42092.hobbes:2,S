Hi,
I have a short question, but I lack the expertise to answer it.
I am creating a thread in a custom system call, through a call to
kernel_thread().  When this thread finishes, it becomes a zombie and
persists until the user program which called the system call exits.  Is
there any way to all to make the kernel thread die cleanly when it
finishes?  (Without doing something like waitpid()).
Thank you very much.
