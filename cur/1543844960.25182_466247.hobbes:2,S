Would it be useful to use the logarithm for the + and -? Like
  #perl
  print $filename, " | ",
        "+" x log($additions) / log(2),
        "-" x log($deletions) / log(2);
That would print 'small' changes with more or less (might want to 
tune log(2)) their regular amount of +/-, while 'large' changes (say, 
1000+?) do not create extremely long lines.
