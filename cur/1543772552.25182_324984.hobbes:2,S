Can somebody please point me to the latest patches?
ATA pass thru should be a good thing to play with
I am waiting for SATA ATAPI support so that finally i can start
playing DVDs again under linux.
I have ICH6M chipset with DVD/CD-RW drive on my laptop. So if you need
some testing on that i am willing to do that.
Currently i am running on 2.6.11 with JG's 
"2.6.11-libata-dev1.patch.bz2 " patch and ATAPI tunred on in libata.h,
but apparently it still is not in working condition, are there
experimental patches which have atleast half working ATAPI in libata?
Or should i just wait for some more time ?.....
Thanks and reagards,
BAIN
