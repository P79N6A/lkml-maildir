I just upgraded from 2.6.11.3 and now my /proc/acpi/button directory
doesn't exist...
$ gzcat /proc/config.gz | grep BUTTON
CONFIG_ACPI_BUTTON=y
And the kernel is detecting my buttons....
$ dmesg | grep LID
[4294668.236000] ACPI: Lid Switch [LID]
$ dmesg | grep PWR
[4294668.235000] ACPI: Power Button (FF) [PWRF]
[4294668.235000] ACPI: Power Button (CM) [PWRB]
$ dmesg | grep SLP
[4294668.236000] ACPI: Sleep Button (CM) [SLPB]
$ find /sys -name "*LID*"
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LID
$ find /sys -name "*PWR*"
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/PWRB
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/PWRF
$ find /sys -name "*SLP*"
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/SLPB
All the directories found are empty.
My dsdt is a bit screwed (damn microsoft.. I'm gonna fix it and see if
it make a difference) but it did work before.
$ dmesg | grep DSDT # fyi
[4294667.296000] ACPI: DSDT (v001 Clevo     648FX 0x06040000 MSFT
0x0100000e) @ 0x00000000
Also, sleep doesn't work and has never worked, but that could be
because of the dsdt maybe.
