Ok.  Then I will see if I can review these in the next couple days
and give some feedback.
At a quick skim through the code it appears there is some more infrastructure
then we need and things can still be simplified.
Since this applies in particular to the user space interface I'm not comfortable
with these patches going in just yet.
The unused KEXEC_PRESERVE_ flags especially give me pause.  Having something
like that, that isn't currently wired up sounds like a bad place to start.
