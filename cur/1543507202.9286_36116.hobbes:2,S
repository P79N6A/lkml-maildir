Compile it by hand.  Something like
cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/net
kgcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer  -pipe -fno-strength-reduce  -DCPU=686  -DMODULE
-DMODVERSIONS -include /usr/src/linux/include/linux/modversions.h
-DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c ppp.c
cp ppp.o /lib/modules/2.3.15-UP/misc
depmod -a
