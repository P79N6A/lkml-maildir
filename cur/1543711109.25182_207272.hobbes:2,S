Here is the history. Patches for wacom.c in 2.4 was majorly modified by John
Joganic. Specially, the reset thread was added by John to deal with the case
when the tablet is set/reset to HID mode. Otherwise the driver will have to
be reloaded. The code was tested by users. Patches for wacom.c in 2.6 was
made by myself.
The reason I didn't add the reset thread to 2.6 patch was because I don't
know exactly how to do it in 2.6 and I didn't find proper examples from
other device drivers in 2.6. Basically, I don't want to introduce any new
"feature" before I can convince myself.
The reason I didn't remove the reset thread code in 2.4 was because it was
tested by many users and there are no negative feedbacks. 
So, we need the reset thread. Please let me know the proper approach to
implement this feature in 2.4 and 2.6. I'll update the patches accordingly.

I didn't remove it - it was not present in the 2.6 patch.
