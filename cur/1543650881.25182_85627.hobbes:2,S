You got to hear my comment now, several times: convince somebody _else_.
But no, it wasn't the answer you wanted.  So you refuse to listen.  And
yes, I get irritated too.  So right now I won't touch LKCD with a
ten-foot pole, if only because I've been mail-bombed by people who argue
for it when I have better things to do than to explain myself over and
over again. 
What's so hard to understand about the "vendor-driven" thing, and why do
people continue to argue about it?
