The obvious candidates would be all those items currently read by
simple syscalls like gettimeofday(), time(), getpid(), getppid(),
getuid(), getgid(), etc. so those operations (where the syscall
overhead strikes most) become simple reads (with an adapted libc).
This would especially rock getpid()-based benchmarks ;-) but also good
for X11 applications, etc. which frequently call gettimeofday().
Perhaps it would even be beneficial to map (parts of?) the task
structure there.
