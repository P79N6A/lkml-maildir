Subject: Linux 2.6.17.11 -- compilation failure on alpha

On alpha compilation fails because arch_mmap_check() is not defined -- 
mm/mmap.c does not include include/asm-generic/mman.h, the only place 
where it is defined as (0) for architectures that don't have it. The 
problem disappears if that definition is copied into mm/mmap.c itself 
or, better, include/asm-alpha/mman.h
