I think you're essentially on your own if you eject a card with a
mounted and active filesystem on it.  I consider this to be abusive
enough that fixing it isn't even on my to-do list.  If anyone with
more IDE interest wants to work on it, the issue boils down to making
ide_unregister() gracefully deal with a device that is already long
gone.
