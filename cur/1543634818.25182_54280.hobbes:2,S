That is what happens with PCI devices. They're not appearing as meaningful 
names probably because CONFIG_PCI_NAMES isn't set. Whether or not that 
information belongs in the kernel is another debate. 
I believe the SCSI people mentioned something about being able to set 
those from userspace. I'm not opposed to such an idea. You just need a 
writable name file.

Those are in the devices themselves, right? There is nothing stopping the 
USB people from doing that... ;)
