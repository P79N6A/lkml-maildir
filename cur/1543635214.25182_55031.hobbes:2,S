It makes me very unhappy too. There are a number of horrible things
there, mostly for the sake of convenience and performance.
sys_call_table is just the most obviously foul thing.  I'm glad to hear
there is interest in getting some kernel support for such things to be
done tastefully.

How do you see such dentry names being exported to user-space for the
profiling daemon to access ? The current oprofile scheme is, um, less
than ideal ...

I'm interested in doing so but I'd like to hear some more on how people
perceive this working. It essentially means a fork for a lot of the
kernel-side code, so it'd mean a lot more work for us (at least until I
can drop the 2.2/2.4 versions).
