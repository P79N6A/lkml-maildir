mmap()ing a device file for that driver, and accessing the memory.

OK, I'll try to keep it straight ;)

Fair enough, I just didn't want to gamut of reactions from maintainers
to my cleanups ;)

The file offset given to mmap must be page size multiple, and thus vm_pgoff
is in units of page size (see the fault handler, where it gets shifted).
Removing this restriction would allow the use of offset in mmap(), but if
you want to disallow it for other reasons, then I guess the comment
should be changed to explain why.
