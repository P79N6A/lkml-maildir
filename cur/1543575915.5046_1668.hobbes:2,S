Hi all,
OK, this now assembles the full outstanding set of raw IO fixes for
the final 2.2.18 kernel, both with and without the 4G bigmem patches.
The only changes since the last 2.2.18pre24 release are the addition
of a minor bugfix (possible failures when retrying after getting colliding
kiobuf mappings spanning two separate process virtual memory spaces),
and the addition by popular demand of the ability to unbind raw
devices (just bind them to 0,0 to unbind).
kiobuf-2.2.18.tar.gz has been uploaded to:
	ftp.uk.linux.org:/pub/linux/sct/fs/raw-io/
and	ftp.*.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/people/sct/raw-io/
