I'd say send something simple (SIGWINCH?) to all apps opening fbdev, and
for legacy apps (e.g. current Xorg) use an userspace helper listening to
this signal and sending X (or Y or Berlin) an expose event (perhaps
after waiting for the proper input device, depending on some policy).
Otherwise I like much your other idea of allocating memory by freeing
non-dirty pages if possible, but that doesn't solve the problem that the
restoration of the previous state (or the expose event) has to wait for
user input or a timeout or something. That kind of decision belongs to
userspace.
