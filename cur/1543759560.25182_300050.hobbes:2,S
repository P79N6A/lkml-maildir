I see gross screen corruption without the full patch on 2.6.6, but this
is gone in 2.6.11. 
I suspect I am preempting someone elses work, but they haven't (yet)
come forward, and as I said I haven't been able to get in touch with the
drivers maintainer.  I'll ask the framebuffer layer maintainer about it.
I've not CC'd him in this email because my habit of stripping quotes has
left it without context.
