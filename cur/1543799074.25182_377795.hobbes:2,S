Right.

Nodz. That doesn't mean they don't have their strong points, which we

"With some drawbacks" is the point: It has been determined that the
drawbacks are heavy enough that the 8KiB stack option should go. Given
there is /no/ compelling argument /against/ 4KiB stacks, even very minor
drawbacks are important. So first make 4KiB the standard (popular
distributions work that way for /years/ now, with no measurable downsides),
then axe 8KiB stack as an option. Also note that 8KiB stacks really only
gives 4KiB to the process (plus (or minus!) a random ammount depending on
the interrupts being serviced ATM), and this has been so forever.
Oh, well, one of the larger drawbacks of 4KiB stacks is the inevitable
flamewar, each time with /less/ data (this round I've seen none) supporting
the need for larger stacks, into which all kinds of idiots* are suckered.
