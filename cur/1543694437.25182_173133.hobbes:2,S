true, but one advantage of useing multiple hashes is that once you already
have the data in the CPU you can probably do multiple cheap hashes for the
same cost as a single one (the same reason that calculating a checksum is
essentially free if you are already having the CPU touch the data) when
the CPU is 12x+ faster then the memory bus you have a fair bit of CPU time
available for each byte of data that you are dealing with.
