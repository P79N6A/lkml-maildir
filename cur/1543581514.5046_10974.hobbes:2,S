Sorry, no time to test, neither I have cisco cards.
However, general notes:
	1. Aironet did (cisco may do) weird tricks on bus.
	2. insmod driver  -> leds go out, that may be  normal.
		ifconfig up should bring leds on.
	3. People who fail with both drivers (Bens and mine), have
	 had weird BIOS or BIOS settings in most of cases. 
	  IO conflict with bios configuration port (ICL  486 ),
	  old PCI BIOS (Intel Pentium 200Mhz board) , etc.
