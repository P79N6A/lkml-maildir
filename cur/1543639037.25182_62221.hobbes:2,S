   The changes to drivers/net/tg3.c in -pre1 broke the compilation:
 ...
   /home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.4/linux-2.4.19-full/include/linux/if_vlan.h:186:
   warning: implicit declaration of function `netif_receive_skb'
   tg3.c: In function `tg3_poll':
Because Marcelo took the tg3 NAPI changes but not the NAPI
infrastructure. :-)
I'm hoping since he's decided to take the generic NAPI changes
this compile failure will go away in -pre2
