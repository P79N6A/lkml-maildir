higher priority (numerically lower) branch and create the whiteout there.
(Starting a sentence with 'and' is like telling fairytales^W stories.)

Either:
  Modifying a Unionfs branch directly while the union
  is mounted is currently unsupported.
Or:
  Modifying a Unionfs branch directly, while the union
  is mounted, is currently unsupported.

For written text, non-shortened forms (should not) are preferred. At least
that's (<- that's texified speech not documentation) what we were told back in
