I remember Jim Houston used a hack of just loading the old stack into a register
and defining that as a base register in CFI. I guess i would be willing 
to trade a few moves for that (should be pretty much free on a OOO CPU anyways) 
You think that trick would work?

UNW_PC() is instruction_pointer(&frame->regs), isn't it?
