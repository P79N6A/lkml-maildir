I'd have thought this had already been asked many times before, but 
google didn't show me anything.
My problem is that mails in a large maildir get temporarily lost. This 
happens because readdir() never returns a file which was just rename()d 
by another process. Either new or the old name would have been fine, 
but it's not returned at all.
Is there a chance this could get fixed? Every OS/filesystem I've tested 
so far has had the same problem, so I'll have to implement some extra 
locking anyway (so much for maildir being lockless), but it would be 
nice to have at least one OS where it works without the extra locking 
overhead.
I have a test program if someone wants to try it:
