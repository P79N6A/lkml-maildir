I'd agree (long term even more strongly), although along with that I'd
like to be able to pick and choose my subarch. So I can have a kernel
that supports say, PC and BigSMP, but not NUMAQ or whatever. I believe
this is doable with your infrastructure, but I'm not sure how much work
it will take. 
And before we make any larger changes, I'd like to just get stuff
compiling first (Keith's apic patch landing about the same time and
broke generic, and generic broke summit so right now neither subarch
builds properly). 
thanks
