How about feature regressions?  What made me think of this is the thread 
about the 8x0 alsa breakage in 2.6.11. 2.6.10 and 2.6.9 worked well for 
people, but 2.6.11 is aparently broken for some. When that bug gets fixed 
would such a fix be appropriate for 2.6.10.y (assuming it doesn't violate 
any of your other guidelines) ?
