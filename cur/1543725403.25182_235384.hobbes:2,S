so is 2.4.x and problems i mentioned can occur there too but are
harder to hit

it's not really a workaround, it just makes the problems harder to hit
a real fix is going to be hard, it's partly the fact there are
insanely long complicated paths and partly the fact for ia32 gcc
spills register space badly and bloats functions (afaik amd64 uses
significantly less stack in some functions)

neither address the real problem though
