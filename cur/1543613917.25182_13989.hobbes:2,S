    I've using gcc-3.0.1 to compile the kernel since it was released
and my linux 2.4.16 runs without problems. In my experience, the only
problem is the ICE raised by the 8139too driver, although this seems
to have been corrected on gcc-3.0.2 (I haven't updated my compiler
yet). I haven't found any bug yet running my linux box, but this
doesn't mean that gcc-3.0 is safe for the kernel. It's safe for my
configuration of the kernel, at least.
