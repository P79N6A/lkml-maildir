This looks really ugly. PAGE_OFFSET is usually a macro.
I looked in patch 29/52 where PAGE_OFFSET is defined (unsigned int 
PAGE_OFFSET), which got me wondered: PAGE_OFFSET can be a runtime 
variable when it is a constant on most other arches?
That being said, I'd use
#define PAGE_OFFSET __page_offset
in some header file and in the .c file:
	unsigned int __page_offset;
	EXPORT_SYMBOL(__page_offset);
that is how arch-frv and -uml seem to do it.
