Turning on hyperthreading effectively halves the amount of cache 
available for each logical CPU when both are doing work, which can do 
more harm than good.  Number-crunching applications that utilize the 
cache effectively generally don't benefit from hyperthreading, 
particularly floating-point-intensive ones.
On the other hand, hyperthreading is excellent for streaming integer 
work, like compiling.  Whether or not you should use it depends entirely 
on your workload.
