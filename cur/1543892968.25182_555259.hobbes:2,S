So, user with `diff` will see that and fix or a way of usage spaces in
strings, or will update BRE, used for that kind of match ;)
Still, better job:
|-*- 
olecom@flower:/tmp$ ls -l ipv62.h.clean
-rw-r----- 1 olecom root 10591 Jun  8 22:47 ipv62.h.clean +2 bytes
olecom@flower:/tmp$ ls -l ipv66.h

But there will be two shifted words, because it doesn't calculate
tabstops. I've choose to remove spaces before tab, so it will be visible
and easy to fix by hand. Only spaces up-to next tabstop - 1 after
possible tab is OK.
