So?!? This ATA100 and ATA133 standards do not make any sens? It is not
possible to have more than 66 MB/sec with on drive and is seems that it is
not possible to use more than ~30MB/sek of 100 or 133 MB/sec ATA100/133
bus speed with two HDDs. Oh :(((
Another question - why ATA100/ATA66 HDDs are so slow with UDMA33?
With new IBM 60 GB IC35L060AVER07-0 I have much more than 33 MB/sec with
ATA100 and only 24 MB/sec with UDMA33 (Asus P2B with IntelBX). New 80GB Seagates
(Baracuda IV) have the same problem.
