   Hmm I would have thought that it's way easier to do it now,
   since LFS is getting integrated as well.
Is LFS support getting integrated for 2.3?  I would really like that to
be the case; two of the most often requrested features are support for >
2GB files on ia32 platforms, and support for 32 bit uids.
