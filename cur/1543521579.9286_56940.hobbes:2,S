Subject: Oops in 2.2.13 (in __brelse) and ksymoops is obsolete?

Last night the unthinkable happened, Linux got an oops :).
It happened while I was gccing a file. And before you say 
anything, I've been using this exact hardware for over a
year and this is the first problem, so it's not that.
I got a nice oops report in the logs (below) but ksymoops
doesn't seem to do anything with it. It also complain that
it is obsolete. The ksymoops that comes with 2.2.13 is
obsolete? How can that be?
Anyway, ksymoops seems to get the addresses wrong. There 
is a version of ksymoops numbered 2.3.3. Is that likely 
to work here? There's also a mention of a patch about 
klogd preserving information. Is this relavent?
I'll be upgrading to 2.2.14 now, but I've been using this
kernel since November 25 iirc so it doesn't look like
it's repeatable.
I was gccing a file in /tmp. After this, any process that
tried to do anything with /tmp froze in D state. Which
make me wonder again if it would be possible to have locks
cleaned up after an oops.
Please CC any replies.
