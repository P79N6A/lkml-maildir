Actually, VSYSCALL_BASE is defined as an absolute symbol in
arch/i386/kernel/vsyscall.lds, so it's not as broken as one might think.
The bug is that the script cannot find symbols defined by the linker
and used only as a constant in the same linker script. Fortunately, this
isn't done in many places.
