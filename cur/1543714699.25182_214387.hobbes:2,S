No!  This is address space, not RAM. Whether or not a PCI device
or whatever has internal RAM that's mapped makes no difference.
I told the kernel that it has 500m of RAM. It better not assume
I don't know what I'm talking about. I might have reserved that
RAM because it's bad or I may have something else important to
do with that RAM (which I do).
