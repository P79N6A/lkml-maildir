Agree. We can calculate smp_num_siblings from phys_proc_id[n] as the kernel
does, although it would be just nice or double-checking (but if the
application cannot calculate it correctly how can one expect it runs fine? I
mean it's very easy.)
So this is sufficient:
+#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
+	if (cpu_has_ht) {
+		seq_printf(m, "physical id\t: %d\n", phys_proc_id[n]);
+	}
+#endif
For a multi-core system, one could do:
	seq_printf(m, "physical id\t: %d\n", phys_proc_id[n]);
	seq_printf(m, "core id\t: %d\n", core_id[n]);
This would support multiple SMT processor cores on one chip. "core_id" is
the id of the CPU core in a chip die that the processor belongs to.
"physical_proc_id" is the id of the CPU die in the system.

Not really. We print out the 'duplicate' info because it's read that
way from different CPUs. The smp_num_siblings is a single global
variable. Theoretically, the other stuff /could/ change in an
asymetrical system, but the num_siblings thing is constant.
