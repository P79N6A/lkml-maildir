That's perhaps not a terribly effective way of multiplexing keventd cycles.
If someone has done a schedule_work(), that will stick an entry onto
keventd's worklist, but it won't necessarily set need_resched().
We'd need to extend the workqueue API to be able to determine whether
there's other work pending.
