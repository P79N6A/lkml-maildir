Now you are talking complete crap. If init crashes what happens. If I
have the wrong root fs listed what happens ?
Gee it breaks. Early userspace actually does have to be correct.

Please read the code: that is what we do. That is *WHY* you got the
runaway modprobe message. It was caught but despite that the broken
initrd failed to recover. We've had that feature for years.

Its an incredibly obscure corner case. It is not appropriate to totally
trash years of kernel testing by panic re-ordering some init functions
just before a release. You will undoubtedly harm more people than you'll
please.

That would be an interesting experiment for 2.6.29 however we do requests
in lots of different formats so it might be a bit more complex. You could
store the last few strings. However the existing runaway code caught it
and will have resulted in the -ENXIO path occuring anyway so I don't see
what your "change" will achieve.
