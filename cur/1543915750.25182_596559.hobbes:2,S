Can you please disable the patches, which I sent Linus wards:
timekeeping-access-rtc-outside-xtime-lock.patch
xtime-supsend-resume-fixup.patch
acpi-reevaluate-c-p-t-states.patch
clockevents-enforce-broadcast-on-resume.patch
clockevents-do-not-shutdown-broadcast-device-in-oneshot-mode.patch
clockevents-prevent-stale-tick-update-on-offline-cpu.patch
Without those patches you get the state of rc4-mm1. It would be
interesting to know which one interferes with the acpi stuff.
