Subject: 2.6.2 scsi host reset success but all device are offlined

I am running 2.6.2 linux on i386. During the error injection test, eh_device_reset, eh_bus_reset and eh_host_reset were called by scsi_error.c in sequence.  For each reset, HBA driver returned SUCCESS (0x2002, I specially traced the host reset case). 
The quesion is why scsi_error.c failed to react properly according to the returned reset status.
The scsi_eh_host_reset() calls scsi_try_host_reset() and further calls hba eh_host_reset_handler. Upon the retuned status SUCCESS (0x2002), it shoud not call function scsi_eh_offline_sdevs().  Inmy case, every time host reset SUCCESS will lead to "Device offlined" situation from scsi_eh_offline_sdevs(). All available device are lost.
I thought I might get quick answer for this issue from commmunity before debugging into scsi layer code.
Thanks!
Eddie
