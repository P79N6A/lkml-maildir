the problem is we do this..
    command_put(sp->current_command);
	exec_next_command(sp);
command_put drops the refcount of the kobject in sp,
which then gets freed in the .release (free_command)
which ends up kfree'ing 'sp'.
unsurprisingly, it goes bang the next time something
tries to access it.  (Ie the 2nd line above)
It's totally busted.
