I have problem with Matrox G400 framebuffer. After turn
on computer, kernel freez durning boot with snow on my monitor.
When I start it with options video=matrox:disbled, and run XFree86
4.0.1 with official drivers from Matrox web page, and reboot my
computer again - everything works fine.
From dmesg:
matroxfb: Matrox unknown G400 (AGP) detected
matroxfb: MTRR's turned on
matroxfb: cannot set xres to 800, rounded up to 832
matroxfb: cannot set xres to 800, rounded up to 832
