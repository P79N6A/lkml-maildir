see our website at 
http://ltp.sourceforge.net
.
This release contains many enhancements and bugfixes.  The following
testsuites have also been contributed to this release:
Multithreaded floating point stress suite developed by Bull and IBM
dealing with:
 -Trigonometric (acos, asin, atan, atan2, cos, sin, tan)
 -Euclidean distance function (hypot)
 -Computes the natural logarithm of the gamma function (lgamma)
 -Functions that manipulate floating-point numbers (modf, ldexp, frexp)
 -Exponential and logarithmic functions (exp, log, log10)
 -Hyperbolic (cosh, sinh, tanh)
 -Bessel (j0, j1, y0, y1)
 -Power functions (ceil, fabs, floor, fmod, pow, sqrt)
Apple's fsx-linux NFS test suite
This test does various operations over NFS such as seeks, IO, and changes
to a test file to try to confuse NFS.  It watches for data corruption
while doing these operations.  This test has been set up to work over NFS,
or on local file systems.
