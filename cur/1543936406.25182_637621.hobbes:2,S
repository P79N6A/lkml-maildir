The common scheme used elsewhere in the kernel for handling more than
one device in a single driver is aliases. The i2c code's existing
driver_name/type combination is a different way of implementing the
same feature. But there is no real need for driver_name/type on any
platform if aliases are used. Back in version 10 or 11 I had code in
there which replaced the two fields with aliases on all platforms but
too many people objected so I removed it..
IMHO, driver_name/type should be removed in new style drivers and
replaced with aliases on all platforms since aliases are the standard
kernel mechanism.
