Hi,
I am running 2.6.5-rc2 on a Dell Latitude D600. If I boot with the USB
keyboard and mouse attached, those devices will not be found and they
will not function. If I plug them in after booting, they are found okay.
After unplugging and plugging back USB devices several times, now the
events/0 process is using more CPU than normal (~7%) and keyboard/mouse
use is sluggish.
Raf.
