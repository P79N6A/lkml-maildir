Hello Willy,
sorry, you probably misunderstood my flaky explanation. What I meant was not a
cached block from the _tape_ (obviously indeed a char-type device) but from the
3ware disk (i.e. the other side of the verification). Consider the tape
completely working, but the disk data corrupt (possibly not from real reading
but from corrupted cache).

Very likely not the same block size, with tar I use -b64.

It does. There's no head repositioning.

Very unlikely, how do you create an overrun in a synchronuos single read
operation?

I doubt that. Reason is that though the tape is pretty fast for a tape it is
still pretty slow compared to a disk. Since I use the box for months now I
would have expected such a hardware problem to show up for disk access, too.
And there was none.

Hm, interestingly the former freeze bug (solved by marcelo through backout of
some patch in rc8) did not show up in UP. Since then I did not test UP any
more. The problem itself does not necessarily point to flaky hardware, as I
would have no idea how bad cache can only show up during a tape verification,
that does not sound all that reasonable.
More likely could be a SMP race anywhere from nfs-server, 3ware disk driver to
page cache, or not?

Stephan
