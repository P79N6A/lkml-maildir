which is wrong. so?

excuse me, pete, but being sarcastic does not suite you well:
in Message-Id: <200108311322.PAA12269@nbd.it.uc3m.es>
you write:
> #define MIN(x,y) ({\
>    const typeof(x) _x = ~(typeof(x))0; \
>    const typeof(y) _y = ~(typeof(y))0; \
>    if (sizeof(_x) != sizeof(_y)) \
>      MINMAX_BUG; \
this is just not right. you don't  even honour if x and y are of the
same signedness! if x and y are of the same signedness, a comparison
can be done at absolutely no risk regardless of the size!
and even *if* the sizes differ, there are cases, where the comparison
still can be done at no risk. namely:
 signed short / unsigned char       ->  OK
 unsigned short / signed char       ->  OK
 signed int / unsigned char         ->  OK
 signed int / unsigned short        ->  OK
 signed long long / unsigned char   ->  OK
 signed long long / unsigned short  ->  OK
(I don't know about signed long long / unsigned int, I'd have to ask the
compiler/assembler. but I guess it will be okay, too)
but:
  unsigned int / signed char        -> fails.
  unsigned int / signed short       -> fails.
  unsigned long long / signed char  -> fails.
  unsigned long long / signed short -> fails.
  unsigned long long / signed int   -> fails.
I haven't really verified all cases, they are a conclusion from seeing
the code gcc generates.
if we follow your minmax-macro code:
>    if ((_x > (typeof(x))0 && _y < (typeof(y))0) \
>    ||  (_x < (typeof(x))0 && _y > (typeof(y))0)) \
>      MINMAX_BUG; \
>    __MIN(x,y); \
>  })
if I see this right, after requiring the size be the same, you also
require the same signdness?
but:
 : 	char a; unsigned char b;
 : 
 : 	a=-1;	b=255;
 : 	if (a<b) ....
will work perfectly. same applies for short a/unsigned short b;
