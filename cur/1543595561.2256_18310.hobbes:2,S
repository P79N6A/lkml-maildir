Hi,
I do not fully unterstandt the printk code, so perhaps somebody can answer
me this (probably stupid ;) ) question:
If I do a printk, is there a packet (aka a sk_buff) created? If I turn on
debugging in my code, I see a huge pile of sk_buffs which are allocated but
which do not get in touch with the "essential" parts of the network-code
(e.g. ip_rcv) where I have modified some code. I can't explain it to me
fully, but perhaps someone of yours has a suitable answer.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Jens Hoffrichter
