I applied the patch and the problem seems to have gone away, where it was
fairly reproducable beforehand. It waits a little longer (about 4 seconds)
during the NFS daemon shutdown before [  OK  ] pops up, but it could be my
imagination because I was doing it on the 166 and I was used to the 866's.
But what matters is that I can stop and restart NFS just fine now whereas
before I couldn't. Thanks for the patch.
