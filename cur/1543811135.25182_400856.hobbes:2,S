	What version is this patch against?  This line was removed from
mainline a while ago.
	As to why it was removed, the discussion happened back then.
Basically, if something requires CONFIGFS_FS (eg, OCFS2) and is a
module, then a user is asked whether they want configfs as a module or
built-in.  Text saying "say N" is completely incorrect there.
