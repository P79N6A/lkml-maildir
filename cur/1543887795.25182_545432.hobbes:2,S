Try these:
# echo anticipatory > /sys/block/.../scheduler
# echo 0 > /sys/block/.../iosched/antic_expire
# echo 192 > /sys/block/.../max_sectors_kb
# echo 192 > /sys/block/.../read_ahead_kb
These give me best performance, but most noticeably antic_expire > 0 leaves 
the IOScheduler in a apparent limbo.
