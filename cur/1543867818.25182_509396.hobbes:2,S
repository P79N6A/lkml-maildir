Subject: [patch 00/21] Xen-paravirt: Xen guest implementation for paravirt_ops interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andi,
This patch series implements the Linux Xen guest in terms of the
paravirt-ops interface.  The features in implemented this patch series
are:
 * domU only
 * UP only (most code is SMP-safe, but there's no way to create a new vcpu)
 * writable pagetables, with late pinning/early unpinning
   (no shadow pagetable support)
 * supports both PAE and non-PAE modes
 * xen console
 * virtual block device (blockfront)
 * virtual network device (netfront)
The patch series is in two parts:
1-12: cleanups to the core kernel, either to fix outright problems,
      or to add appropriate hooks for Xen
13-21: the Xen guest implementation itself
I've tried to make each patch as self-explanatory as possible.  The
series is based on git changeset
ec2f9d1331f658433411c58077871e1eef4ee1b4 +
x86_64-2.6.20-git8-070213-1.patch.
Changes since the previous posting:
- rebased
- addressed review comments:
 - deal with missing vga hardware better
 - deal with Andi's comments
 - clean up header file placement
 - update netfront, and move it into drivers/net
I looked at linking in xen-head.S rather than including it into
xen-head.S, but it seems to provoke linker bugs, so I've left it as-is
for now.
Thanks,
	J
