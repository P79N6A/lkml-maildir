have you all gone nuts??? It's not an option to break perfectly working
binaries out there. Hell, we didnt even reorder the new NPTL
syscalls/extensions 1-2 kernel releases after the fact. Please grow up!
the interface should have been gotten right initially. We are all guilty
of it - now lets face the consequences. It's only a couple of lines of
code in a well isolated place of the file so i dont know what the fuss is
about. I havent even added FUTEX_REQUEUE to the old API.
