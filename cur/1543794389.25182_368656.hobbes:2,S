The continued dumps wouldn't be the problem, the walker is allocated
on the initial dump call. It was a mistake though, nlk->cb_lock spin
lock is always held for cb->dump() even though it should only be
required during the nlk->cb != NULL check. netlink_dump_start()
guarantees to only allow one dumper per socket at a time.
