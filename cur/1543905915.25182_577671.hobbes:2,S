"Summary screen" will do, but yes, I understood. Perhaps your BIOS isn't 
fond of the state the Linux drivers leaves your DVD-ROM at. Judging by your 
"nv_pata", you are probebly usiing the pata (pata_amd) driver, not the old 
IDE driver?
Does it boot through if you disable booting from the DVD-ROM?
