When encoding mp3s on a dual processor system, naturally I try to
encode two at once.
Most of the time this works as expected, one processed more or less
sticks to each CPU.  However, I have noticed that if for some reason,
a third process has to be scheduled (which is inevitable if you
actually want to do anything), then these two processes seem to bounce
back and forward for a few seconds, _even_ after this CPU spike has
gone.
Now, I'm not sure if I'm imagining this or not, as I said, I have two
CPUs and two CPU-bound tasks, to instrument this as all, I really have
to affect what I am looking at (rather like the uncertainty principal)
so I assumed that perhaps my programs to read and process
/proc/<n>/cpu was simply eating several cycles and each process was
yielding more or less at random causing what I saw seeing.
