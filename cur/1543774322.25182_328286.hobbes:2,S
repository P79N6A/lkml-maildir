> The patch also removes the atomic_dec_and_test in dst_destroy.
That is the only part of this patch I'm willing to entertain
at this time, as long as Herbert Xu ACKs it.  How much of that
quoted %3 gain does this change alone give you?
Also, please post networking patches to netdev@vger.kernel.org.
Because you didn't, the majority of the networking maintainers
did not see your dst patch submissions.  It's mentioned in
linux/MAINTAINERS for a reason:
	NETWORKING [GENERAL]
	P:	Networking Team
	M:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
	L:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
	S:	Maintained
Thanks.
