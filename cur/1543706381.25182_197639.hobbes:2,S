At risk of sounding stupid, how can a user space program check the type of
media (DVD vs. CD) that's in the drive?  I think that's what magicdev is
trying to do.
Thanks

I'm rather anxious about applying anything like this, in my experience
it's much much safer to simply let the command fail. I don't see
anything technically wrong with your approach, I'd just like it tested
on 100 different dvd drives :)
magicdev should be checking the media type itself first.
