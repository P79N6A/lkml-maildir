When you declare a variable volatile, you don't actually tell the compiler where 
you want to override its default optimization behavior, giving it some freedom 
to guess your intentions incorrectly.  When you put the cast on the data access 
itself, there is no question about precisely where in the code you want to 
override the compiler's default optimization behavior.  If the compiler doesn't 
do what you want with a volatile declaration, it might have a plausible excuse 
in the ambiguity of the C standard.  If the compiler doesn't do what you want in 
a cast specific to a single dereference, it's just plain broken.  We try to be 
compatible with plausibly correct compilers, but if they're completely broken, 
we're screwed no matter what.
