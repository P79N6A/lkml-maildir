Hi all,
This version should fix all the outstanding issues I know of. Get it at
ftp://ftp.kotelna.sk
:/pub/mato/tgafb-1.11.diff.gz. Please test it as much as
you can, I think it is now stable enough to consider including it in the
kernel Real Soon Now.
Also in that directory is alpha-memmove.diff.gz which you may want to
use/read/whatever but be warned it's correctness is questionable :-).
Cheers,
mato
