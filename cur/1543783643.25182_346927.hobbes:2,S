Someone may like to deal with this.  Maybe the file should be placed
in the Documentation/serial directory?

           Summary: file:Documentation/jsm.txt  is missing
    Kernel Version: 2.6.13
            Status: NEW
          Severity: low
             Owner: rmk@arm.linux.org.uk
         Submitter: h.rueter@gmx.de
Not really a bug,
but i'm missing this file.
Help in "make menuconfig"
{
-> Device Drivers                                                   
  x       -> Character devices     
  x         -> Serial drivers    
}
says it could be found in "linux-2.6.13/Documentation/jsm.txt"
Probably just a little copyjob for the developer ...
