By "async futex" I mean FUTEX_FD; sorry if that wasn't clear.
By "sync futex" I mean FUTEX_WAIT.

I don't see a problem, as long as it is documented.  Anybody grokking
the old futex code would expect futexes to move with mappings.
It's a mild surprise whatever behaviour, because:
   - if it's a MAP_SHARED, then the program doesn't have to move futexes,
     and this is a good thing (think locks in a remap_file_pages
     database mapping).
   - the old (page pinning) version moves FUTEX_FD futexes "automatically",
     in the sense that they're attached to the page which moves.

That would work.  An mm isn't that huge once everything's been
unmapped by exit.  Alternatively, mm-private futexes can be woken when
the mm is destroyed.
I just implemented the latter, but come to think of it a reference to
a dead mm is light enough not to bother with a list of "futexes
attached to mm to destroy on exit".
So I'll throw that away and provide a patch which just takes a reference.
(Also, takes inode references).
