Hello, 
I noticed that the bogomips results for the two cores on my machine are 
consistently not the same, the second one is always reported slightly 
faster, it's a small difference and I saw the same in a posted dmesg from 
somebody else on the list. Which made me wonder: 
Shouldn't they be the same, as the cores run from the same clock? 
Could it be a bug in the bogomips calculation which could make some of the 
short time-out stuff fail?
Could this be related to the tsc synchronisation stuff mentioned in the 
lost ticks - TSC timer thread? 
Regards, 
Robert Boermans. 
PS nothing actually fails on my system because of this, I just thought it 
was odd. Although I do sometimes get the clock runs at double speed 
problem but only after at least one day uptime, but I reboot most days for 
games anyway.
