It wasn't all that big a change for the i386 arch either. Most of the changes
to assembly actually involved cleaning up and various assembly sources and
sharing constants (something that should probably have been done a lot
earlier).
What might be worth doing is to move the task_struct slab cache and
(de-)allocator out of fork.c and to stick it in the arch somewhere. Then archs
aren't bound to have the two separate. So for a system that can handle lots of
memory, you can allocate the thread_info, task_struct and supervisor stack all
on one very large chunk if you so wish.
