There is a userspace rarpd that works in
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/dhcp.bootp.rarp/
There is just one problem with it, it doesn't really compile on a
2.3.x/glibc2.1 based system, and making it compile doesn't seem to be
a trivial job either.
I made a statically linked binary with libc5 of it that works 
(atleast with my sun3/60) in 2.3.18, if anyone needs it I put it in
http://www.netppl.fi/~pp/rarpd
