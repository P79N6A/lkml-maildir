Well the basic problem is that for any piece of code that can be modular
we need a way to ensure all threads it has running are shutdown when we
remove the module.
Which means a fire and forget model however simple is unfortunately
the wrong thing.
Now we might be able to wrap this in some kind of manager construct,
so you don't have to manage each thread individually, but we still
have the problem of ensuring all of the threads exit when we terminate
the module.
Further in general it doesn't make sense to grab a module reference
and call that sufficient because we would like to request that the
module exits.
