On my system it lives in /etc, but you can place it anywhere you want, see the 
part below which I copied from the microcode README
***************************************************************************
>>> updating every system boot
***************************************************************************
A simple script has been included for systems to apply the microcode
update on boot. The script is a good illustration on how to use the
utility but it may be useful to run through some basic usage.
Without using the provided startup script, to update your microcode and
free the internal buffer on every system boot you'll need to add a line
like the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local (where prefix indicates the
location of the binary)
prefix/microcode_ctl -iu
or to specify another microcode file
prefix/microcode_ctl -if /etc/microcode.dat
Simple as that. Problems? Contact either myself at simon@veritas.com or
Tigran at tigran@veritas.com
