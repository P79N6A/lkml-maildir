	A thought, that I'm sure has been said before, but...
/devices -- devfs mountpoint
/dev -- symlinks in to /devices
	devfs then adds option to have /devices just be a crapload of
files named 'major,minor' in the old fashion. ;)
	The problem here is, how do you give permissions to symlinks?
That's really the kicker, but fix that, and you may have something...
	I realize this is ugly, but some way to store the permissions in
the symlink, or have something in there devfs can read real quick to determine
if you have permission?  I somehow fear a hardlink-type thing wouldn't work
too well either, but this seems like something that should be possible to
do, perhaps not, tired, end of day, time ta go home. :)
