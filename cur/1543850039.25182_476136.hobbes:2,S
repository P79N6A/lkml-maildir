I don't have one at hand right now but I suspect it's 1.1. I'll ask
paulus tomorrow. They are cells inside an Apple ASIC but on a PCI bus
(on-chip PCI bus).

Well, the old Apple ones support power management but not the PCI PM
states. However, there are separate magic bits in the Apple ASIC that
can be used to toggle the clocks on/off (which is that the ppc specific
bits do basically, along as turning off power on the bus).

Well, the question is wether we want to make the whole machine suspend
fail because there is a 1394 chip that doesn't do PCI PM in or not...
I can send patches "fixing" it both ways (just ignoring the result from
pci_set_power_state in general, or just ignoring that result on Apple
cells).
Ben.
