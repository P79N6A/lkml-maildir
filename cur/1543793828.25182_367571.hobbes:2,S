Sure but I haven't worked out the details of the changes yet. All I am fairly certain at this point is that 
1) New Trackpad sends in more data than the old one. ATP_DATASIZE has to be increased from 81 to 256. (The original code was dying with EOVERFLOW from the URB complete routine. 256 is the minimum value it is happy with.)
2) The 15" also has 26 x 16 sensors - not sure how many the 17" has - most likely same
3) The FUZZ, PRESSURE, XFACT and YFACT, along with the button reporting all needs to be reworked - this is my preliminary opinion, might be wrong but with the original code, the mouse moves erratically and the button events don't seem to be delivered right.
Will post complete details once I have it working.
Thanks
Parag
