Oh crap, yes.  If need_resched() and system_state==SYSTEM_BOOTING then
cond_resched_lock() will drop the lock but won't schedule.  So it'll return
true but won't clear need_resched() and the caller will lock up.
So if cond_resched_foo() ends up dropping the lock it _must_ call
schedule() to clear need_resched().
So, how about this (it needs some code comments!)
