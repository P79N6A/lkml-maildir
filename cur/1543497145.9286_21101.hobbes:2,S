Subject: /dev/random and /dev/psaux: too much entropy assumed?

Using a small test program which first reads all pending data on
/dev/random, and, after that, reads byte by byte from /dev/random and
counts the total number of interrupts occurred (summing up the second
column in /proc/interrupts) until a timeout occurs, I obtained the
following interesting results:
First run: single-user mode, no activity during the sampling phase:
Sampling time:      15.006219 (in seconds)
Interrupts:         1501
Random bits:        0
(The 1501 interrupts are probably timer interrupts.)
Second run: single-user mode, cat < /dev/psaux > /dev/null was running
in the background, I kept moving the mouse during the sampling phase:
Sampling time:      15.000942
Interrupts:         5931
Random bits:        40216
After subtracting the timer interrupts, we get an average of over
nine bits added on each /dev/psaux interrupt to the /dev/random pool.
I don't think that there is that much entropy involved to justify this
high value.
The same might be the case for other interrupts, but I haven't looked
at them.
