It fails for me.

No, then something is wrong. When new mail gets delivered, the atime
on the mailbox shouldn't be updated. Why should the delivery agent
want to read the mailbox first? It just appends to the mailbox, so
only mtime gets updated, and atime stays the same.
Ah wait, I understand. Your mail program probably rewrites your
mailbox - so atime and mtime both get updated. Mine doesn't.
(In fact, it's not an mbox, but a maildir-style mailbox).
Now when I read my mail, atime doesn't get updated so the mailcheck
routine doesn't know I read my mail. When new mail comes in I don't get
a message "You have new mail" since it already told me that before, and
it thinks I still haven't read my mail.
Mike.
