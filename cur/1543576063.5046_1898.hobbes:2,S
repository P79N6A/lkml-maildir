serverworks requires you not only to sign an NDA, but also do all
development on-site at their santa clara HQ under their direct
supervision.
I think it's rather stupid to have to take several days off work to fly
down to their HQ just for code that will take maybe 5 minutes to write.
If someone in santa clara wants to do it, fine.
