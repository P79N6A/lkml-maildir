FWIW, Riley's second patch made no difference for me either. (Bash 1.14.7(1),
in case that matters.) Strangely enough, the unalias -a seems to have no
effect in the subshell! :|
Here's an alternate patch. This one puts a backslash before the ls statements,
so that the alias is bypassed. It's not as conceptually clean as Riley's
approach, but it works (for me, at least). 
Also, invoking the ver_linux script as "./ver_linux" (assuming correct
permissions) or "sh ver_linux", instead of ". ver_linux" seems to fix the
problem for me, regardless of whether any patch has been applied. Perhaps,
if there are no disadvantages to this approach (I don't have time to give it
serious thought right now), it would be better to make a patch that refuses
to run and gives an appropriate error message in the presence of aliases, or
that runs itself again using an explicit "sh" command in the presence of
aliases. I probably won't have time to implement either of the above for two
weeks or so, however...
