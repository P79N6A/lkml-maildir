I've often found symbolsize useful.  Not when looking at an oops
from my own machine.  But when looking at an oops posted on LKML,
from someone who most likely has a different .config and different
compiler, different optimization and different inlining from mine.
symbolsize is a good clue as to how close their kernel is to the
one I've got built on my machine, how likely guesses I make based
on mine will apply to theirs, and whereabouts in the function that
it oopsed.
