People who use udev can make sure they have it built into their kernel
if they have such a dependency.
Not everyone uses udev, and therefore needs AF_UNIX non-modular.
I keep seeing this crap patch get submitted and I'm going to keep
dropping it because it's bogus.
It seems to stem from some filesystem interface or whatever that the
VFS folks don't want to export or one they want to now stop exporting.
But that is a really cruddy reason to want to force AF_UNIX to not
be allowed to be modular, and the udev thing just makes it more of a
joke rather than a good technical reason.
