I used to have a small system with 96M RAM and no swap, only OpenSSH 
and bash and some kernel threads were running, when I got a big BK 
pull, it would catch sig 11 and die. Maybe this is unrelated. 
Indeed, at first I had only 64M RAM installed, only after some sig 
11, had I got more RAM installed. But this probably has nothing to 
do with your situation.
