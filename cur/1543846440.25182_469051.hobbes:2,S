Then I am puzzled by the function declaration:
static int orinoco_hw_get_essid(struct orinoco_private *priv, int *active,
                                char buf[IW_ESSID_MAX_SIZE+1])
Do you mean that this function is called with a buf parameter which
doesn't have the expected size? (as far as the function declaration is
concerned) Shouldn't the declaration be changed to
static int orinoco_hw_get_essid(struct orinoco_private *priv, int *active,
                                char buf[IW_ESSID_MAX_SIZE])
then to reflect the reality? (it won't change the code but would be
clearer from a documentation point of view)
