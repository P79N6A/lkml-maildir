hello,
Thanks rolf & roland.
pci_iomap() is not doing something extra. only it is some kind of
abstraction for IO-mapped OR memory mapped.
I know that my BARs are MMIO, so using ioremap() & readl()/writel()
combination should be fine.
But for the problem as explained in my first mail, any
help/suggestions will be helpful.
