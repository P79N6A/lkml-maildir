100% agreed.
However, for our purposes, TinyCC is only missing two pieces needed for 
successfully building a bootable kernel:
* __builtin_constant_p
* function inlining
Given the existing TinyCC source base, function inlining is a big step 
(since tcc doesn't do AST-like things currently), so don't expect that 
very soon.  TinyCC is a fun little project to watch and play around 
with, though, and can compile most major open source projects, as well 
as itself.
