Is that actually CodingStyle?  Don't see it much in the kernel code...
The much more common (AFAICS) style to split long function definitions is
static void foo_long_function(struct long_struct name *foo, struct bar *bar,
                              int val, long *err)
The only reason (AFAICS) for putting the return type on a separate line
is the (ancient) ansi2knr script, which just throws the return types away
for pre-ANSI compilers.  Given that the kernel code doesn't even conform
to ANSI-C, there is no hope in hell of it compiling with a pre-ANSI compiler.
Cheers, Andreas
