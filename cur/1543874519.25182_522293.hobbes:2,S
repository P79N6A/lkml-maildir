I'll summarize/rephrase what I've already said in the thread James Morris linked to:
You need a way to protect your kernel binary, or else this whole thing becomes a joke.
(Modify kernel, reboot...)
Assuming you have a secure kernel binary that is tamper proof, why do you need
slow and complex asymmetric encryption again? If you can write protect the kernel,
you can also read protect it (or let the boot loader pass the key to the kernel).
So what stops you from using a simple symmetric key cipher for signing?
