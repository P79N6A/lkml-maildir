Subject: [PATCH 0/6] UML - small fixes and cleanups for 2.6.17
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/3/129

The following patches are small changes which either fix important bugs or
which have no functional effect.
The first one, which adds include/asm-um/irqflags.h should go to mainline
when (or if) the lock validator does.
