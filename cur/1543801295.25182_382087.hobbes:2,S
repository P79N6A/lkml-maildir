JSFD is a block device so tha majors are ok. I'm not just sure if the
PP_MAJOR from linux/ppdev.h should be moved to major.h.
The patch by Jason however is not ok. He had another problem and this
is not the fix. What he tries to do is already in lp and ppdev, where
I think they belong.
There is also something weird: why does RedHat create these nodes in
/dev when udev already does that.
