Ah - a simpler API, more user friendly, more "cpuset API style"
friendly:
    A read-only, per-cpuset Boolean flag that indicates whether the
    scheduler is fully load balancing across all 'cpus' of that cpuset.
    Internally, the kernel would answer this by seeing whether or
    not the cpusets cpus_allowed cpumask was a subset of one of the
    members of the scheduler domains partition.
Call this per-cpuset flag something such as:
    sched_is_fully_load_balanced	# read-only Boolean
This goes along with having the control flag named something such as:
    sched_ok_not_to_load_balance	# read-write Boolean
If a task was in a cpuset that had 'sched_is_fully_load_balanced'
False, then it might not get load balanced.
