Load first sector. Is it an MBR/partition table, or a boot sector?
If the former, add an offset of 32 sectors to all subsequent accesses.
This way, we get consistent behaviour from both types of drive.
You then always mount /dev/sda (or whatever).
(Alternatively, if there is some way of "unhiding" the first 32 sectors
reliably, we should do that - is it possible??)
