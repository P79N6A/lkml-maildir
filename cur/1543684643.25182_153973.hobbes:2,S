It seems that /dev/epoll support will be included in 2.6.  Is this the
official way to solve the problem, or is there another, preferred
interface I have missed?  Is the current /dev/epoll edge-triggered or
level-triggered?
Is the patch for 2.4.21 in sync with 2.6, API-wise?  Can I run
libevent with both kernels?
