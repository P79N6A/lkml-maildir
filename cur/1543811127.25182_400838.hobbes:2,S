Without even looking at the code a strong NACK here.  This is polluting
the namespace which is not acceptable.  Please implement a second
filesystem type gfsmeta to do this kind of admin work.  Search for ext2meta
which did something similar.  Or use a completely different approach,
I'd need to look at the actual functionality provided to give a better
advice, but currently I'm lacking the time for that.
