  Hi, Linus. FYI: 2.5.3-pre2 hangs during boot. The last couple of
messages I get are:
Based upon Swansea University Computer Society NET3.039
apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.15)
apm: disabled - APM is not SMP safe (power off active).
Going back to 2.5.2, the next boot line is:
Starting kswapd
