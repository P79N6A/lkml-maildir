     Has anyone noticed that keyboard repeat doesn't work anymore? (Or
     at
     least under conditions I don't yet understand). Here's some salient
     facts,
     1. If you hold a key down, first two keystrokes come back at normal
         speed. Subsequent keys that are recognized are returned,
        at the rate of one per second.
     2. I've seen this on my Gateway 2000 with a P60 and Mercury
     motherboard.
        Have a PII450 where everything continues to
         run fine. Only certain PS/2 keyboard/mouse interfaces?
     3. Seen this on 2.2.0-pre8 - 2.2.1 (ac)
     4. Naturally things have worked fine with previous versions. I'll
     have
         to go back to when keyboard.c/pc_keyb.c were reorg'ed
         to know when the fault began.
     5. With all kernel messages in keyboard drivers allowed, there's no
          obvious timeouts.
     6. Am comparing this to 2.0.36 drivers. (man is it different). The
          enable_keyboard() inline: the only architecture that might
          expand this into a useful macro is an SGI/mips. Do those boxes
          support 101/PS2 style keyboards (i.e., should the macro be
     re-instated?)
