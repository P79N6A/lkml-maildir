I was getting all sorts of funny reportedly code errors with RH GCC:
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.2 2.96-112.7.1)
It used to build ok, then report an error somewhere.. but never in 
the same place/file.  Funnily enough, a kernel built with 5 or 6 of 
these errors (i.e. just 'make'ing again from where it 'broke' to 
carry on the build) is OK.
Well, for me it turned out GCC gets very _flakey_ if CPU (K6 233) 
gets too hot...
...I just put on a bigger heatsink, and it fixed it!
The machine had/has never shown any other symptoms of overheating 
until/unless I build a kernel.
