Hi Alan, everyone,
Changes to the black and white QuickCam driver in this patch:
1. Fix for missing camera parameter update if the grab size is
   changed with VIDIOCSWIN.
2. Lazy updates of the camera frame data. Only update the camera
   brightness/image size when we need to.
3. Addition of parameters to control the frequency of yields to the
   scheduler when grabbing a frame from the quickcam. This should
   avoid having 'freezes' for 1-2 seconds while a frame is grabbed.
Todo:
1. Memory-mapped grabbing support.
2. Further work on the lazy update scheme.
3. SMP protection ??
4. Camera detection scheme improvements?
Cheers,
Mark
