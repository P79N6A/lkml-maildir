The moment you do serial console, the user needs to know. I would hate
having to have console=ttyPZ0 in my kernel command line. Does that even
work? I didn't see a change to the console setup in your patch. Serial
is for much more than modems and PDA sync. In fact, I would think that
many more Linux systems these days use serial for console than for any
other purpose due to the use of such setups in large data centers and
the reduction in serial peripherals for desktop computers.

The TTY_MAJOR should have never belonged to 8250.c in the first place.
I know it's just my opinion, but I think this major device should be
owned by the serial core, and it shouldn't matter what chip drives each
individual port. Each hardware driver should just register with the
core how many ports it has and should be allocated from the same range.
This situation is purely a side-effect of the fact that all the
original Linux supported hardware used the 8250 driver and everyone
who didn't use 8250 was marginalized enough that they got ignored.
