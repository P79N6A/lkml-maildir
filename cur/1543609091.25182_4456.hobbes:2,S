Don't be surprised if all that printing will degrade the performance of
your router.

Printk doesn't write to disk, syslogd does.

Change /etc/syslogd.conf. Put all kernel messages into a separate
logging file and put a '-' before the log file name so syslogd will not 
sync the file after each write. See man syslogd, klogd, syslog.conf
