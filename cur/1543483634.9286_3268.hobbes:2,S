forgive me for asking what is probably a stupid question, but I was under
the impression that the cache management was a hardware/chipset issue, not
a user/kernel process or are you talking about reprogramming the hardware?

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
