Hello:
I sent the following message to the kernel newbies mailing list, and it
was suggested that I send it to the kernel mailing list.  I am not a
subscriber of this mailing list, so I would appreciate any replies being
sent to me directly.
-----------------------
I have found that after upgrading from 2.2.19 to 2.4.6, I can no longer
read CD-ROMs that were created under Windows.  Since they work fine on
2.2.19, I assume there is some configuration option that has changed,
but I did not see anything that looked suspicious.
I can mount the CD and list the files on it, but when I try to access
one of the files on it, I get an IO error.
When I created the disk on Windows, I selected the option to "Organize
the disc so it can be read in most standard CD-ROM drives...".  On
Linux, I selected the kernel options for ISO 9660 and the Joliet
extensions.
Does anyone have any ideas about what I am doing wrong?
Thanks,
Bruce
