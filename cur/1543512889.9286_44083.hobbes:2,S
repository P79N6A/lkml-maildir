The card I have at home says audiopci 9937, but this one has a model number
at the top which is ct5803

The smaller chip has the numbers:
SIGMATEL
SIAG9721T
CB3S41
9935
There is a symbol above those number sets, it looks like the 'E' math
symbol and sorta looks like a T on top of it.
The other board that I looked at had 'ensoniq' stamped on the board.  This
board has no brand stamped on it, but 'creative' is stamped on the biggest
chip (same number, es1373)
