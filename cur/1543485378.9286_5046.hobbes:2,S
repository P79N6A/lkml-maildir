In 2.0.35, (a p90 laptop, 8Mb) badblocks -w slows everything down to
a crawl, but it all still works, at this moment, a kernel compile is
proceeding s l o w l y, and that's with the kernel image and swap on the 
same spindle as badblocks.
Everything is maybe running at 1/20th speed, of which the cospindlarity
probably accounts for some.
However, running slowly is much better than any user being able to 
effectively kill a running machine. (with access to a block device larger
than memory?)
