sorry about, but that wasn't an intend.
This action has been done by one or more of the apps I am using (editor, 
mailer...). I assume it is a feature of Kmail, inserting plane text seems to 
be converted to space separated text, discarding tabs.

This address was in the original file I got from the net. Perhaps this file 
have had spaces instead of tabs, too.

Ok. that should be ok. I am not used to the rules on the kernel traffic list.

I did add one on last request.
Was this wrong ?
Perhaps I need an Howto about mailing to kernel list. I read the main 
documentation, but didn't found this amount of request rules in a way that 
would be sufficient to publish a patch which I just wanted to make useable by 
the whole community.
I will try to verify how I could generate the patch in a way that it might be 
acceptable.
