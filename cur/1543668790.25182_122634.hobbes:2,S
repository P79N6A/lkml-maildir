I think acpi_handle_t is "an opaque type specific to the OS on which the APCI
code happens to be running".
It is presently `void *', implicitly pointing at a spinlock_t.
If the above guesses (I'd prefer not to look) are correct then
	struct acpi_handle_t {
		spinlock_t lock;
	};
would make a ton more sense.
