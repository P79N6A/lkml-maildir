Subject: VGA text console display problem with kernel 2.6.23-rc5/6

i've 2 servers with old PCI VGA cards, one using X86_64 kernel 
version 2.6.23-rc5 and one with i386 kernel version 2.6.23-rc6,
both wired into the same CRT via a KVM switch.
No matter what text screen size i set on both these machines (using 
resizecons) the shell line where i type in commands is past the 
bottom of the screen, invisible.
Another box connected to the same KVM displays fine, and it runs 
2.6.22-rc7.
i also have a box running kernel 2.6.23-rc5 where the console 
display is fine: it uses a GeForce 8500 PCI-E vidcard driving a LCD 
screen.
