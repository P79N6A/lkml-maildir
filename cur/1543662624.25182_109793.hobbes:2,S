Larry,
A possible solution to this is to provide the equivalent of the
"Download Message Raw" link which marc.theaimsgroup.com provides, e.g.
here: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-net&m=104524036019392&q=raw
BTW, thanks for creating and providing BK.  It seems to me that the
positive contributions you've made far out-weigh the negative aspects
which some perceive.
