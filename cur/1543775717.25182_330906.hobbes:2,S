Both cases?

They were part of my previous submission attempts as indicated in the
first message [Patch 0/3]. Last time I sent them people were discussing
whether or not we should have this likely/unlikely, so I left this out
this time, as I'd rather prefer discussing the other patches.
Still, the 3% perf. increase measurement that has been done was with
patches 4 and 5, so claiming otherwise would not be right.

For completeness, find both attached.

Subject: Consider the capability case the likely one
References: SUSE40217, SUSE39439
The case that security_ops points to the default capability_
security_ops is the fast path and arguably the more likely one
on most systems. So mark it likely to tell the compiler to
optimize accordingly and increase the chances of having this
predicted correctly by the CPU.
This is patch 4/5 of the LSM overhaul.

Subject: Test security_enabled var rather than security_ops pointer
References: SUSE40217, SUSE39439
Rather than doing a pointer comparison, test an integer var
for being null. Should be slightly faster.
I consider this patch as optional.
Note that it does not introduce a (new) race, as we still set
the security_ops pointer to the capability_security_ops. So no
wmb() is needed for the module unload case.
Sidenote: A wmb() in the module load and unload cases might
actually be useful to ensure that the other CPUs start using the
new LSM pointer ASAP. It's still racy, but that's by design of
LSM. Introducing locks would hurt performance tremendously.
One could do RCU ... but that's not for this patchset.
This is patch 5/5 of the LSM overhaul.
