  This seemed to fix the problem for me as well.  I have had DMA turned
on since then, and I have experienced no file system corruption anymore.
Thanks!
  Maybe the help message for this kernel option (CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS)
should report in big blocky letters that disabling it might cause major
data loss with some drive/bios combinations?..  I was not aware that I
was touching such a sensitive parameter when I rebuilt the kernel, and
the help message didn't warn me in any way.
