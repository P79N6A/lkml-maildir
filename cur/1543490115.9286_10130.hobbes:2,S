And, to clear up all the confusion, the version of unfsd I was testing
against (beta19 at the time, I believe) was denying the request. If newer
versions have been "fixed", well..
For root there isn't much that can be done. Perhaps we could try to use
the original (broken) behavior and only if that fails to revert to the
correct behavior. I don't know if this strategy would work against
non-unfsd servers, I don't have easy access to solaris anymore.
BTW, unfsd should be fixed, not the kernel.. at least for 2.2.x.
