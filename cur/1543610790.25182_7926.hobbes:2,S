	There are some issues with netfilter+routing but it depends on
your setup. There are patches for this. You have to explain your
problem with the routing because Netfilter uses both pre- and
post-routing for different things. Your statement is ambigous. Do
you mean using the filtering in post_routing or what? I assume it
should be something with NAT but better you to explain.
