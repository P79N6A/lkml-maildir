That is of course the other problem with this approach - you can't
really get the intended results without some extremely heavyweight code
(using an IPI to halt all CPU's, doing the access and then resuming
them)
The bigger problem (and certainly with some of the cmov emulation hacks
I've seen) is getting the security checking right when you need to
reprocess the user data - another reason to do it in userspace with a
