It's not added now - Michael started the development about 5 years ago,
in 1998 he stopped working on it.  In 1999 or 2001 I started hacking on
it, only adding what I needed.  Now I finally found the time to make a
formal release.
The tool mconfig parses CML1 rules, and does so _much_ more strictly
then any other parser.

The current cml1 scripts are _very_ ugly, and even if cml2 makes it in
2.5 (yes, I don't like it - but I don't have to decide it..) kernels
using cml1 will be around for a long time.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
