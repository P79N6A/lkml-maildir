Hello,
I'm trying the pmdisk suspend on a Dell Latitude laptop.
All device drivers seem to be suspended correctly,
just at the and a text screen is displayed saying:
  Suspend-To-Disk Failed
  No Suspend to Disk Partions
and after few seconds the laptop reboots.
Strange is, this screen I remember from some older
dell laptop where I was using the APM-bios to do
the suspend. So probably the text screen is displayed
by bios.
Do you have any idea how to overcome this problem?
thanks,
Michal
