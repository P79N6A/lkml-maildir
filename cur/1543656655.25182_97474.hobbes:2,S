It's not coded to reject stuff.  Just parse it and point out obvious mistakes.

I do see what you mean, but that's not how I see it working:
user submits bug report
[it gets stored]
robot generates messages similar to compiler *warnings*.

What about that data corruption bug that was pointed out around
2.4.18, and brought up again, when it was discovered that the patch
wasn't applied.  That is a case of a bug report getting lost.  Not
exactly what I meant, though, but it's relevant.

Well, that's what the automated warnings would protect against - at
least the user would get a response, telling them how to submit a more
useful response.

Well, if we never get above that rate of bugs being entered in to the
database, then we might as well not have it, and go back to having
everything on LKML.

Good point :-)

I mean make it easier for people to identify dupes.
I've got loads of ideas about how we could build a better bug database
- for example, we have categories at the moment in Bugzilla.  Why?  We
already have a MAINTAINERS file, so say somebody looks up the relevant
maintainer in that list, finds them, then goes to enter a bug in
Bugzilla.  Now they have to assign it to a category, and different
people may well assign the same bug to different categories -
immediately making duplicate detection more difficult.
If the number of bugs is always going to stay low, then my idea is
probably a waste of time, but I think that we are eventually going to
have loads of bug reports.  We _want_ more bug reports, especially in
the development tree.  Few enough people are testing it as it is!
John.
