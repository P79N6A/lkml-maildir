Erm, but that's why it's an rsync archive.  You're supposed to have a
copy of the kernel archive already.  The one at
rsync://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/torvalds/kernel-test.git
Then, the few additional files I have rsync across very fast.
Take a look at how git works:  files, once added to the object tree by
sha1 hash stay there forever.
