Ok, and I'm suggesting general method for the "unwanted defaults"
problem. Just have a /sys/.../terminal_init_string.
During reset, let console code interpret terminal_init_string, to set
_wanted_ defaults. So you'd do:
echo -en "\e[11;0]" > /sys/.../terminal_init_string... and I'd do
something similar with softcursor settings. (Which are currently reset
to compiled-in defaults, and that is "unwanted defaults" to me).
