this seems reasonable, I can reroll the patch for this.  As I think about it I'm
also going to update the patch to make this check occur for any pci class 0600
device from vendor AMD, since its possible that more than just nvidia chipsets
can be affected.
I'll repost as soon as I've tested, thanks!
