I assume you mean on the server.  In which case I do have it running.
But for kicks I started it on the client.  Then ran the program and 
it took a awhile, but it eventually got the lock.  Every subsequent
time I ran it the lock was obtained "immediately".  I killed statd
on the client and it continued to work.  I then stopped and restarted
the knfs suite (mountd, statd, nfsd) on the server and found the
following in the logs
Feb  7 19:53:17 styx /usr/sbin/knfs/statd[3411]: recv_rply: can't decode RPC message! 
Feb  7 19:53:35 styx last message repeated 3 times
Feb  7 19:53:41 styx /usr/sbin/knfs/statd[3411]: Can't notify 192.168.1.2, giving up.
However, I can still get the locks.  Again the first time was slow but
after that it is fine.  So now it seems fine.  Rather odd.  I don't
know what will happen next time I reboot.
