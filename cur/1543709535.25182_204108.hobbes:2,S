I, for one, never had any such concerns.  My concern was about the 
unpriveledged user begin unable to run certain applications under load 
without prior approval.
Two philosophical points:
1) Perhaps we are trying too hard to please everyone.  As Linus said, 
perfect is the enemy of good.  A good scheduler won't work perfectly for 
everyone's application, but it will work very well for the most 
important ones.  Perhaps people writing schedulers should compete based 
on overall throughput and latency, rather than on how well it runs xmms 
(and other such apps).
2) Perhaps certain apps like xmms are 'broken' can be rewritten to 
behave better with the new scheduler.  For instance, more buffering, 
separating the mp3 decoding thread from the thread that feeds 
/dev/audio, more efficient decoder, a decoder that voluntarily sleeps 
when it's 'done enough', so that it doesn't get knocked down to a lower 
priority, a decoder that 'cheats' on audio quality just to maintain low 
CPU usage when it finds itself being preempted, etc.
It bears mentioning that many applications work well with 2.4 because 
they evolved to work well with the 2.4 scheduler.  The 2.6 scheduler is 
different.  We shouldn't constrain 2.6 for the sake of old apps.  Those 
old apps should be rewritten to adapt to the new environment.  "Working 
well under 2.6" doesn't require any more adaptation than with 2.4, but 
it does require _different_ adaptation.
This isn't to speak negatively of Con and Nick and others who have 
attempted to improve upon the 2.6 scheduler.  If they can make old apps 
work well without impacting the potential that new apps can get out of 
2.6, then more power to them!
