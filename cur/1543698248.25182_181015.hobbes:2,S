Hmmm. Can any of the cpufreq folks comment on this? I'm guessing
time_cpufreq_notifier() isn't updating fast_gettimeoffset_quotient
properly. I've never had a laptop that did cpufreq properly, so I've
never been able to test this.

If the cpufreq code isn't working right, the system will seem to loose a
massive amount of timer ticks, which will be noted and we'll fall back
to using the PIT as a time source.  Although if you're seeing such heavy
skew, I'm surprised we don't trip that code earlier.

The "sane timesource" is the PIT (programmable interval timer). The TSC
is the Time-Stamp-Counter which is basically a cycle counter on the cpu.
If you want to boot using the PIT instead of the TSC, you can override
the default time source by using  "clock=pit" as a boot option. However
hopefully the problem can be fixed by adjusting the cpufreq code. As I
don't have any such hardware, would you be interested in testing
possible patches?
thanks
