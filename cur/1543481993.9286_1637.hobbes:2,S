The driver can be found at:
http://www.insync.net/~frantzc/cpqarray.html
However, this is only the kernel driver, it won't help you install RH
on your machine. The way i do it, install RH on a disk attached to the
onboard SCSI controller, then mount the RAID Array and copy.
If you have the time, i am busy trying to adjust the RH install, so it will
support the Smart raid controller.
Greetings, Eric.
