Georg, while desirable its very tricky if possible at all.
You need to stick your pid or so into the lock and do it 
atomically. So let's assume we only stick with architectures that can do 
cmpxchg-doubleword, still its not fool proof. 
First, the app could still corrupt that count or pid field of the lock 
In that case the whole logic get'ss crewed up.
There is no guarantee that you ever know who holds the locks !!!
Secondly, what guarantee do you have that your data is kosher ?
I tend to agree with the masses, that hand waving might be the best
first approximation
