I believe they do, since the kernels desing obviate the need and use
of several diferent tools (that shouldn't be needed) like for instance
for having raid5 with snapshot and dinamic partition resizing we will
allways need:
md-raid5
lvm
some FS.
This md-raid5 and lvm separation is the evidence of how the kernels
design & API affect usability and userspace tools that the user is
obliged to use. I cannot have those features without "bumping" into
this kernel design issue.
 This is also a problem for any developer who tries to improve
usability in this area by creating some unified userland tools to
manipulate MD & LVM. (Imagining myself implementing some userland tool
to create some "storage devices" + mount points.. doesn't  seem easy
nor fun..).
