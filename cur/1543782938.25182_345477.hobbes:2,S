afaik, as soon as we hit a p2p bridge, we just blindly re-allocate
everything in my experience.
I have a lot of cases on ppc64 where calling
pci_assign_unassigned_resources() will simply screw everything up and
lead with a bus in a completely unuseable state, with things half
relocated, conflicting bits, etc... Ok, that was about 2.6.12 timeframe,
I never had time to fully debug that. Part of the problem was some
assumptions about the existence of a prefetchable range in a given
position in the resource array, or the kernel having a different idea
than the firmware on where such things should go.
I'll try to go back to it sooner or later. The problem on macs for
example is that we can't afford to have some devices moved at all (like
the Apple ASIC that contains the interrupt controller etc...). Those
bits are probed & the drivers are setup before we touch the PCI bus,
based on the open firmware device-tree. If we move them around, we are
screwed. There are other issues with the fact that the PCI probe will
temporarily cut access to thsoe devices during BAR sizing or bus
numbering, thus if you take an interrupt at the wrong time, you are
toast.
Finally, on ppc64, we also have the case of partitioned machines where
we aren't allowed to touch some busses at all (and the kernel really
tries to reconfigure p2p bridges all the time).

I'll try to find out.

Yes I know that part, I'm not sure yet why it gets reallocated.
I suppose paulus and I need to spend again some serious time on the PCI
code. We have to anyway with the pending merge of ppc32 and ppc64 so it
might be a good opportunity to try again getting the common code in
drivers/pci/setup-* working for us.
