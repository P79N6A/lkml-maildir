So do you see the problem with fragementation if the hypervisor is
handing out, say, 1 MB pages?  Or, more likely, something like 64 MB
pages?  What are the chances that an entire 64 MB page can be freed
on a large system that has been up a while?
And, if you create zones, you run into all of the zone rebalancing
problems of ZONE_DMA, ZONE_NORMAL, ZONE_HIGHMEM.  In that case, on
any long running system, ZONE_HOTPLUGGABLE has been overwhelmed with
random allocations, making almost none of it available.
However, with reasonable defragmentation or fragmentation avoidance,
we have some potential to make large chunks available for return to
the hypervisor.  And, that same capability continues to help those
who want to remove fixed ranges of physical memory.
