Thanks, unfortunately there was this huge delay before your email was answered. Sorry for this inconvenience.

Yes, I am aware of this project.  In fact, Lennert did a presentation about 
this on the netfilter developer workshop in Nov 2001

That would be acceptable.

no, it will not work.  It clashes as soon as you want to use connection
tracking on a bridging firewall.

This is, of course, possible.

I don't see any big problems.  If master stays the first member in struct
nf_ct_info, it should even work if there is a mis-use somewhere in the code,
referencing directly to nf_ct_info instead of nf_ct_info->master.

It's great seeing that the bridging stuff finally gets included.

I have read the new (2.5.44) patch.
The only issue that comes to my mind is:
ip_packet_match is getting a way too long argument list.  Can't you write the
matching against physical in/out devices as iptables match extension? (like
ipt_physdev.c?)

Mh. Since bridging firewall is cool, but not something everybody will
use by default [and it adds code as well as enlarges the skb], I think it 
should be a compiletime kernel config option.
