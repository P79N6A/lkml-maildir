This cli-sti removal seems exactly as broken as all the ones i've NAKed on
kernel-janitors.  There's no evidence that I can see for locking in the
interrupt handler.  Here's a race example:
CPU 1				CPU 2
sony_sleep();
spin_lock_irq(&sonycd535_lock);
enable_interrupts();
				cdu535_interrupt();
				disable_interrupts();
				if (waitqueue_active(&cdu535_irq_wait)) {
prepare_to_wait(&cdu535_irq_wait, &wait, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
spin_unlock_irq(&sonycd535_lock);
Either you need to move prepare_to_wait before enable_interrupts or
grab the sonycd535_lock in interrupt context.
Hang on a minute.  This driver is always polled, and never interrupt
driven.  There's no problem because this code path is never executed :-P
Nevertheless, it's probaby worth fixing so other more complex drivers
(eg cdu31a) don't copy it wrongly.
BTW, I bet sony_sleep() shouldn't be calling the new-and-improved yield().
