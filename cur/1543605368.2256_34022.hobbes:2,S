However, this means that if anyone has write permission into a tree, they
can "offload" their quota to another user and keep more files than they
ought to.  Also, depending on the permissions of the file/directory, the
"tree" owner may not even be able to delete the files that are causing
their quota to be exceeded.

Hmm, we already have group quotas, and (excluding ACLs) you would need to
have group write permission into the tree to be able to write there.  How
does the tree quota help us in the end?  Either users are "nice" and you
don't need quotas, or users are "not nice" and you don't want them to be
able to dump their files into an area that doesn't keep them "in check" as
quotas are designed to do.
Cheers, Andreas
