Subject: [patch 0/5] PNP: convert x86 legacy serial to platform devs, add SMC IR PNP probe
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series converts i386 and x86_64 legacy serial ports to be platform
devices and prevents probing for them if we have PNP.
This prevents double discovery, where a device was found both by the
legacy probe and by 8250_pnp.
This also prevents the serial driver from claiming IRDA devices (unless
they have a UART PNP ID).  The serial legacy probe sometimes assumed the
wrong IRQ, so the user had to use "setserial" to fix it.
Removing the need for setserial to make IRDA devices work seems good,
but it does break some things.  In particular, you may need to keep
setserial from poking legacy UART stuff back in by doing something like
"dpkg-reconfigure setserial" with the "kernel" option.  Otherwise, the
setserial-discovered "UART" will claim resources and prevent the IRDA
driver from loading.
