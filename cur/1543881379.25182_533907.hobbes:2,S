The small attached script does a nice job of showing animation glitches 
in the glxgears animation. I have run one set of tests, and will have 
several more tomorrow. I'm off to a poker game, and would like to let 
people draw their own conclusions.
Based on just this script as load I would say renice on X isn't a good 
thing. Based on one small test, I would say that renice of X in 
conjunction with heavy disk i/o and a single fast scrolling xterm (think 
kernel compile) seems to slow the raid6 thread measurably. Results late 
tomorrow, it will be an early and long day :-(
