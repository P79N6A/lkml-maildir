Hmmm.. The dualcore AMD TSC usage issue should be resolved now, so
please let me know if you can provide any further info on what you saw
(dmesg, config).

They should be cross-arch safe. Exported from ktime.h

Even so, if I recall, your earlier PPS kit patch had both cleanups and
new features. Breaking that up and pushing just the cleanups might be an
easy way to reduce the patch size you have to maintain until its beta.

Agreed, although interfaces can be added if necessary, so let me know if
you find anything specific that is lacking.
