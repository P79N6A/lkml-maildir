With PCI_GOMMCONFIG enabled and PCIE Port Bus driver included, I got
kernel 
panic at boot time on a non-pci express box. Similar to your case, I 
observed something down in the ACPI subsystem. I tested the other case 
where the kernel is built with PCI_GOMMCONFIG and without PCIE Port 
Bus driver being included, same kernel panic occurred at boot time. I
tested 
another case where the kernel is built with PCI_GOANY and with PCIE Port
Bus driver being included, the kernel boots fine. Based on these test
results, 
it seems that PCI_GOMMCONFIG, not PCIE Port Bus driver, is a root cause 
of kernel panic.

It seems that it is ok to apply the patch for now. What do you think?
Thanks,
