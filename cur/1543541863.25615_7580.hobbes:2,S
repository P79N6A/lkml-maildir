I'am trying to get my plextor IDE cd-writer to function in write mode
but I have some ploblems.
kernel version is 2.4.0-test7-pre5 and Cdrecord 1.8.
The drive is detected by the ide-scsi
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: PLEXTOR   Model: CD-R   PX-W8432T  Rev: 1.05
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
  Vendor: PIONEER   Model: DVD-ROM DVD-104F  Rev: 2.02
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr1 at scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0
scsi : detected 2 SCSI cdroms total.
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 32x/32x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.11
sr1: scsi3-mmc drive: 0x/0x cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
But when "cdrecord -scanbus" tries to open the sg device to scan the bus
none is working.
A regular mount of sr0 or sr1 works OK.
I have never tried using a cd writer under linx before so I don't know
how it's supposed to work but this looks like some type of kernel bug to
me.
ps. is not the scsi system a bit to easy ? I mean after two three hours
you almost get it. we have  sd sg st scd nst devices that I could find
all with interesting indexing, The concept of naming a device d: lookes
in comparison like a stroke of genius.
