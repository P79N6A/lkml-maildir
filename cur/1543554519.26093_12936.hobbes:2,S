Ok, well the patch I've just submitted _ought_ to fix stuff, and certainly
works with my own socket drivers for an embedded board I'm working on.
I have an i82365 eval board kicking around somewhere. I'll see if I can
dig it out tomorrow and verify that it now works, and then perhaps we can
consider re-enabling the config options.
I may add code to handle non-CardBus PCI->PCMCIA i82365 devices again
while I'm at it - because I disapprove of having to specify
"i365_base=0xc800 cs_irq=17" for a PCI card.
