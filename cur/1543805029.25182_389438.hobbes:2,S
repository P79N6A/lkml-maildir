As the patch description said, the i386 defconfig hasn't been updated 
for some time, and I'm therefore updating it with the semantics "the 
kernel that successfully runs on my computer".
I have no problem if someone wants to maintain the i386 defconfig with a 
different semantics, but as long as noone steps up to maintain it, 
I plan to occasionally update it with the semantics "my .config".
