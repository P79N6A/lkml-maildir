this does :) I have seen even more incredible races during boot recently. It 
affects other modules as well, like input loaded by hotplug triggered by USB 
load. depmod on current 2.6 takes some not negligible time.
anyway here is patch against 0.9.13-pre that makes depmod output in temp file 
and rename it after. It fixed the problem for sure for me (like commenting 
out depmod in rc.sysinit did but most people seem to object to it).

would be nice.
