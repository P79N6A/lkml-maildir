It is not practical. One listener never know who else are listening
to the fork connector.
We also need to protect yet another global variable "cn_fork_enable".
Also, in order to implement "cn_fork_enable" as a counter, we need
some sort of registration to prevent an application from sending
repeated "off" notification. One can only turn off its own switch.
