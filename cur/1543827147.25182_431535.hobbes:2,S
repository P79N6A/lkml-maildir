Consider a blkdev of size S1.  Using LVM we increase that value under 
the hood to size S2, where S2 > S1.  We perform an online resize from 
size S1 to S2.  The size and alignment of any new groups added will 
different from the non-resize case, where mke2fs was run directly on a 
blkdev of size S2.
