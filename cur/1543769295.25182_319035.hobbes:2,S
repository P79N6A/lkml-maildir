I'm pretty sure that most drives out there will immediately attempt to
safely retract or park the heads the instant that a power loss is
detected.  There's too much potential damage that can occur if the
heads aren't able to safely retract to a landing zone or ramp, that
trying to save "one more block of cached data" just isn't worth the
risk.
