And FWIW, Christoph was also not able to fix the OLTP problem although
I think it has been known for nearly two years ago now (I remember we
talked about it at 2007 KS, although I wasn't following slab development
very keenly back then).
At this point I feel spending time working on SLUB isn't a good idea if
a) Christoph himself hadn't fixed this problem; and b) we disagree about
fundamental design choices (see the "SLQB slab allocator" thread).
Anyway, nobody has disagreed with my proposal to merge SLQB, so in the
worst case I don't think it will cause too much harm, and in the best
case it might turn out to make the best tradeoffs and who knows, it
might actually not be catastrophic for HPC ;)
