I think this would be a bug. If some another process can spin for
ourtask->sighand->siglock without holding tasklist_lock it can
read ourtask->sighand == oldsighand and spin for oldsighand->siglock.
Then de_thread frees oldsighand:
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&oldsighand->count))
		kmem_cache_free(sighand_cachep, oldsighand);
And we have use after free.
So I strongly believe we do not need to lock newsighand->siglock
at least.
And what about recalc_sigpending() ? Do you think it is needed?

Just for my education, could you please point me to the existed
example?
Oleg.
