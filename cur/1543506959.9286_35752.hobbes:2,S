We are using 2.2.11 in our production machines which all have root,
var and swap running on RAID1 mirrors.  When it became apparent that
the RAID code would not be supported in the near future I took the
time to port the RAID code from 2.2.10 into 2.2.11 so that we would
have a clean patch set.
The patch can be accessed at:
	
ftp://ftp.nodak.edu/pub/linux/ESD/kernel/raid0145-19990724-2.2.11.gz
It should drop very cleanly into a virgin 2.2.11 source distribution.
We are running the code without any problem on a pretty good sized NFS
server fueling a production WEB site for the state university system.
As with anything that sits in main data paths it would be prudent to
test things before entrusting one's data to kernels with this patch in
it.
Good luck and I hope that people find this useful.
