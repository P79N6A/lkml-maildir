Alan, I think you are mistaken here. 
When a device uses ISA DMA it is the DMA-controller that generates the
addresses. The DMA controller does not need to be connected though the
ISA bus it self. 
Actually the 8237 does only know of 16bit addresses, the higher bits of
the addresses are latched in the DMA page registers outside of the DMAC.
Nothing prevents a smart designer from putting 8 extra bits in the
latch. I think that some EISA chip sets had that feature.
This does not help ISA bus-master devices with their own address
generators on-board, however.
