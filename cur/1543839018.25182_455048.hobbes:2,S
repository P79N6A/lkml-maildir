A lot of those are part numbers for discrete chips, and some names are
for various ARM SOC families.
Seems to me the better question is what non-framework RTC drivers are still
in the tree ... and actually a good first pass at answering that is that
every platform touched in your original patch was NOT using the RTC class
framework.  (Not the answer you wanted, right?)  And drivers/char/*rtc* users.
There may be a few other RTCs elsewhere in the tree.
It seems all in-kernel ARM platforms except ARM Ltd's own "Integrator" use
the new framework instead of the older arch/arm/common/rtctime.c code (from
which the RTC framework evolved).  And I know there are other RTC drivers
and patches in the queue.  ARMs that haven't yet merged to mainline will,
as usual, pay the price for their perfidy.

Right; not something addressed in your original patch, or by many current
drivers AFAIK.  For the longest time, swsusp resume got that wrong...

{save,restore}_time_delta() in
	include/asm-arm/mach/time.h
	arch/arm/kernel/time.c
The rtc-at91.c code is layered classically ... RTC is the first platform
device registered, and thus resumed, but it's resumed after the jiffies
timer sysdev (thus with IRQs enabled).  So it will restore the time delta
very early in the resume sequence.  (PXA uses a different approach.)
Presumably this is stuff that should be done by the RTC class resume()
method, probably for the CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE clock (though there
could be a better RTC ... one that's being NTP-corrected).  That'd
be no sooner than 2.6.19, which adds new class-level suspend()/resume()
calls to help offload individual drivers.

Glad to hear it!  Though strictly speaking it _ought_ to make sense to
declare RTCs as clock sources.  They are clocks, after all.  I can even
imagine systems where the RTC issues (non-dynamic) tick interupts; some
RTCs (like those on PCs) are happy giving e.g 256 or 1024 irq/sec.
