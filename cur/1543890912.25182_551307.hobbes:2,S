kbuild: add "Section mismatch" warning whitelist for powerpc
This patch fixes the following class of "Section mismatch" warnings when
building powerpc platforms.
WARNING: arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to 
.init.data:.got2 from prom_entry (offset 0x0)
WARNING: arch/powerpc/platforms/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference 
to .init.text:mpc8313_rdb_probe from .machine.desc after 
'mach_mpc8313_rdb' (at offset 0x4)
