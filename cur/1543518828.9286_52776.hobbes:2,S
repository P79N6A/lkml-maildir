Sorry to reply to myself, but:
I forgot to mention that if you disable this stupid translation,
you get the same AT keyboard protocol as on the PS/2 port, on the
Sun PCIKBD port, and on many other architectures which use AT or PS/2
style keyboards. This way you can use *one* AT keyboard driver for
all these architectures ...
