The problem with user space drivers is that it encourages binary only 
drivers, drivers which work only for a limited set of hardware, and 
other means to reduce choice for the user. There's a reason why binary 
modules make the kernel tainted, I have to feel that this is more and 
worse of same.
Linus will have an opinion, no doubt.
