Nope.  They present a hardware interface to various devices.  Some of those
devices are block devices, but not all of them (eg. tape drives, scanners,
printers, SCSI-IP :-))

Because they aren't.  Alot of the structure is historical... 15 years ago,
all you could plug into IDE were block devices and there you are.

Heh, well, I2O is it's own problem. (And it's eye-two-oh, not zero.) In
most respects, I2O is more like "pci support" than a "driver" per se. (It's
just one more layer.)
