After being burnt a few times in forgetting something that I should
have done when releasing a patch against the kernel, I've created a
Kernel Patch Release Checklist at
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/IA64wiki/PatchReleaseChecklist
 
If you want to you can add new stuff I haven't thought of to this
list:  but you need to register on the Wiki to do so.
