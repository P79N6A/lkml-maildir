Its going in AFAIK. Need to resort my patches and then I will push it 
back.
kzalloc will continue to exist as a shorthand notation. So no problem with 
continuing the conversion. kmalloc with GFP_ZERO may be more advantageous 
in allocator type functionality where the caller may want to specify if 
the allocated memory should be zeroed or not.
