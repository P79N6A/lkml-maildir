I think we have a winner:
/proc/interrupts
------------------------------------------------
           CPU0       
  0:   17321824          XT-PIC  timer
  1:          4          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:   46490271          XT-PIC  soundblaster
  9:     400232          XT-PIC  usb-ohci, eth0, eth1
 11:     939150          XT-PIC  aic7xxx, aic7xxx
 14:         13          XT-PIC  ide0
Approximately 4 times more often than the timer interrupt.
That's not nice...

SoundBlaster 16
A change of hardware should help verify this.
