This is a different question from what I had in mind. There are some
controls in 2.6.x to control the relative tendencies to evict unmapped
pagecache vs. unmapping etc. anonymous memory. I'd try adjusting
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness and reporting how (in)effective that is, then
if that still doesn't work, various things can be adjusted.
