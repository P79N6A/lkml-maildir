Well, I didn't look thoroughly, so it might. But - it uses stat and

But you really don't care about tail -f neither with device, nor with
/proc file. Because you can do cat and block the reads in kernel.

AFAICS (from source), neither can you with character device. You can't
set size for character device at all.

AFAIK You have a control of both file and inode operations for proc file.  It's
your inode and you can set whatever you want there. On the other hand with
device you can only set file_operations (you can't touch the inode structure or
you might confuse the fs driver).
Just there are default proc file and inode operations that are used for
most purposes (there is the /proc/kcore, which is like /dev/kmem - they
work simlarly (neither can create it's content to a buffer), but only
/proc/kcore has meaningful size.

That's why you can't get tail -f (nor tail) work on a device.

AFAIK, that's possible with /proc file too.
