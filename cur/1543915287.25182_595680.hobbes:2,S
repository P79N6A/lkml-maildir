Hello, 
I got a bunch of these into dmesg:
EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,2)): ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory #323880: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0
EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,2)): ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory #323888: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0
EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,2)): ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory #323882: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0
The kernel is 2.4.35 SMP, dual-processor. The scsi driver is Fusion MPT SCSI
Host driver 2.05.16.
The device is /dev/sda2, root fs.
One line per each directory had dropped into dmesg each night (I think
during updatedb) before I noticed.
The directories in question have not been written to for ages:
>debugfs /dev/sda2
debugfs:  ncheck 323888
Inode   Pathname
323888  /usr/share/doc/logcheck-1.1.1
debugfs:  ncheck 323882
Inode   Pathname
323882  /usr/share/doc/dev86-0.15.5
debugfs:  ncheck 323880
Inode   Pathname
323880  /usr/share/doc/mod_put-1.3
The hardware _should_ be solid, although I can never 100% sure rule out disk
level corruption.
Does this ring any bells to anyone, short of block level corruption?
