Is cool.   Thanks for doing this.

The 30% improvement in pagecache-buffered reads is somewhat unexpected.
The blockdevs are not using multipage BIOs - they're still using
buffer_head-based I/O for both reads and writes.  Are you sure that
the 2.4 QLogic driver is using block-highmem?

OK, so there's nothing there at all really (or there may be.  Hard
to tell when the interface has saturated).
But on my lowly scsi disks I was seeing no change in read bandwidth
either.  Only writes benefitted for some reason.   Can you do
some write testing as well?   If you test writes through the pagecache,
use ext2 and not direct-to-blockdev please - that'll take the multipage
BIOs, buffer_head-bypass route.  Plain old read and write of /dev/XdYY
isn't very optimised at all.
Thanks.
