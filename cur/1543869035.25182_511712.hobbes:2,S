Please send patches to the list for review if practical?  In this case it
was.  I trust davem has had a look at the non-trivial changes to
sys_socketpair().
Looking at the changes to audit_receive_msg():
				if (sid) {
					if (selinux_sid_to_string(
							sid, &ctx, &len)) {
						audit_log_format(ab,
							" ssid=%u", sid);
						/* Maybe call audit_panic? */
					} else
						audit_log_format(ab,
							" subj=%s", ctx);
					kfree(ctx);
				}
This is assuming that selinux_sid_to_string() always initialises `ctx'.
But AFAICT there are two error paths in security_sid_to_context() which
forget to do that, so we end up doing kfree(uninitialised-local).
I'd consider that a shortcoming in security_sid_to_context(), so not a
problem in this patch, as long as people agree with my blaming above.
The coding style in there is a bit odd-looking.
The new __audit_fd_pair() has unneeded braces in it.
