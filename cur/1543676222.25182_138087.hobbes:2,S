Please don't remove this one.  Its there for stuff like:
drivers/pcmcia/cardbus.c
struct resource *
cb_alloc_io(unsigned long base, unsigned long num,
            unsigned long align, char *name, socket_info_t *s)
{
...
                ret = pci_bus_alloc_resource(bridge->bus, res, num, 1,
                                             min, 0, cardbus_adjust, &ca);
}
ie, so cardbus can decently allocate resources from the parent bus.
(Unfortunately there's a huge pile of other changes which the above
cardbus code relies on, and I fear that its getting rather late to
get them into 2.5.)
