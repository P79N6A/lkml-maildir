The JVM's extensive use of sched_yield(), plus the HT scheduler causes
some pretty undesirable behaviour in SPECjbb(tm) (see disclaimer).  It
starves some pieces of the benchmark so badly, that the benchmark
results are invalid.  We also start to get tons of idle time as the load
goes up.
In case anybody is curious, we're trying to share more of the data that
we collect when we run the benchmarks.  Most of it us useless, but
someone might find a gem or two.  Here are two runs, one with HT, and
the other without.  There's also a pretty busy gnuplot graph in there:

The benchmark results can be found in:
<run-name>/benchmark/SPECjbb.*
