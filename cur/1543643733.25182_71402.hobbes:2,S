Robert,
I applied the modified patch you sent at 04:51 plus the above and
had to change dump_stack() to show_stack(NULL) in sched.c due to
kernel/kernel.o: In function `schedule':
kernel/kernel.o(.text+0xf13): undefined reference to `dump_stack'
I used plain vanilla 2.5.35 to patch against.
I booted that so-patched kernel and it got much further than before,
up to where syslogd was able to write some stuff to /var/log/messages.
There were many instances of "error: scheduling while non-atomic!",
and the traces were similar.  Here is a decoded one:
[steven@spc5 linux-2.5.35]$ ksymoops -K -L -O -v vmlinux -m System.map <non-atomic.txt
ksymoops 2.4.4 on i686 2.5.35.  Options used
     -v vmlinux (specified)
     -K (specified)
     -L (specified)
