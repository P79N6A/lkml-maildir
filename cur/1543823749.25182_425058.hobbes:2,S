Quite possibly, I started from the assumption that we liked the current
behaviour. Inverting the logic, ie. CON_NEEDS_CPU_ONLINE, would be ok
with me, but it would be a much more intrusive change. All of a sudden
we'll be calling into all sorts of drivers that we didn't previously.
I'll trawl through the console drivers tomorrow and see if I can guess
what percentage look like they will/won't work, then we can decide which
way to flip it.
