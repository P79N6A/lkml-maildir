I think it's fine that your low-level driver can work without ib_core,
ib_mad and the rest loaded.  But I still (after all this discussion)
don't understand why you need to have two SMA implementations to
handle this along with the code to switch between the two modes like:
 > +	list_for_each_entry(dd, &ipath_dev_list, ipath_list) {
 > +		if (!(dd->ipath_flags & IPATH_INITTED))
 > +			continue;
 > +		*dd->ipath_statusp &= ~IPATH_STATUS_SMA;
 > +		if (ipath_verbs_registered)
 > +			*dd->ipath_statusp |= IPATH_STATUS_OIB_SMA;
 > +	}
You also have all the functions like recv_subn_get_nodeinfo() etc. for
handling SM queries.  Presumably all this is duplicated in the
userspace SMA.  Why can't you get down to one NodeInfo query handler?
