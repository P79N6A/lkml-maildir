Differences with `Kernelver':
o	inode leakage fix (syncing back dirty inode when there's noting
	of freeable in the inode-inuse list.
o	fixed kpiod (PF_MEMALLOC) and improved
o	complete /proc race fixes
o	my latest VM with nr_freeable_pages balance. It should work very
	well on low memory and the system should run smoothly also under
	intensive swap operations.
o	improved tqueue.h (better scale in SMP and removed a cli())
o	My new update_shared_mappings() code. This will greatly improve
	performance while handling shared mmaped files from different contexts.
o	irq_state array is PII cache aligned (32byte to decrease bus traffic
	under intense irq activities in SMP)
o	dynamic buffer hash table size (big improvement for high memory
	machines, and saved memory for low memory machines)
o	final fix for the disable/enable_bh I fixed some weeks ago
	This patch fix also a possible not critical race in remove_bh(),
	btw note the wmb() to take care of SMP ;).
o	latest IEEE1284 parport code from Tim Waugh.
o	get_wchan() moved in arch specific section and CTRL+SCROLL-LOCK
	use get_wchan() to get the PC filed information.
o	fixed page bound limits and the case of a new forked not
	scheduled yet process in get_wchan()
o	some still pending (not yet merged from Alan) jiffies wrap update
o	reimplemented hopefully completly wrap compliant time
	to jiffies/msec (and reverse) functions
o	little vmalloc fix + vmalloc SMP thread safety
o	bttv doesn't generate 50 irq per sec even if not used
o	some other thing
