There are many things that can go wrong, and most of them are very
dependent on the NIC's architecture.  A few minutes of thought would
lead to the understanding that a enforced-common list of error/problem
messages is equivalent to a set of error counters.  We have had that
since the initial Linux network hardware layer design.  (Note: BSD of
that era had only a single "error" counter. )

The NETIF_MSG_* enable bits classify the status message types.

Most Ethernet drivers should already do this, right around the message

The (physical) interface name, dev->name, should prefix every error
message.  This is a recommendation, not enforced, so not every driver
does it.
