A better solution is to group the various per-cpu data into a single
structure instead of having them scattered as they are now, and then allocate 
as many of these structures as there are CPUs.  This allocation can be done
automatically by the CPU detection and boot-up code, you don't have to
specify manually the number of CPUs.  This also allows the same compiled
kernel to be used on machines with different numbers of CPUs.  Have a look at 
my PDA patch at 
http://reality.sgi.com/dimitris_engr/pda_patch-2.4.0-1
 for
how this can be done.
