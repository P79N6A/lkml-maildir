     Is anyone else seeing problems with kernel 2.6.10 and usb keys
under the Gnome desktop? Fedora Core 2 and 3 has just had two kernel
updates to 2.6.10 (using the -ac8 and -ac9 patches respectively). In
each case, the updates seem to have broken the ability of the Gnome
desktop to present a Flash icon when a usb key is inserted. Oddly if
one boots the machine with the flash key inserted, the Flash icon
does appear in the Gnome desktop's Computer folder. However if one
removes and reinserts the key it disappears and doesn't come back.
I see the same kernel messages as I did under 2.6.7 when I insert
the memory key...

and if I add a line to fstab such as...

I can manually mount the usb key fine. Do you know if any other distros
are seeing this problem with 2.6.10 or if the breakage is likely specific
to Fedora's kernel builds?
