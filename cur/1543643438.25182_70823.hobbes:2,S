Hi all,
This may well not be bug, rather an intended feature, but please enlighten
me why the following doesn't work:
I have two scripts:
/home/pozsy/a:
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello from a!"
/home/pozsy/b:
#!/home/pozsy/a
echo "hello from b!"
Both of them has +x permissions.
But I cannot execute the /home/pozsy/b script:
[pozsy:~]$ strace -f /home/pozsy/b
execve("/home/pozsy/b", ["/home/pozsy/b"], [/* 25 vars */]) = 0
strace: exec: Exec format error
[pozsy:~]$
Isn't this "indirection" allowed?
