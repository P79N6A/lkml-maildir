But the above gives us nothing.
*If* any use of non-GPL symbols only by a binary module was ok then it
would make sense.

Not sure if the court would share this opinion.
Defendant: my module doesn't use any GPL-only export!
Plaintiff: but using XXX normal symbol is a violation too!
D: so why have you created that _GPL thing exactly?
Additionally:
D: top of the COPYING file explicity states binary modules are ok.
This is of course fine if we consider normal use of non-GPL-only
symbols ok.

Technically only.
I have to agree with Alan that the list of non-GPL modules only is
quite tiny nowadays. Madwifi is in terminal state, ATI is opening the
docs and working on GPL driver, modem drivers are mostly thing of
the past, NVidias will probably be supported by the open source driver
soon even if they don't open their code.
Embedded devices have full Linux, not just modules.
