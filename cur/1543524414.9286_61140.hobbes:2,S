   so i put this in the kernel 2.3.38 init/main.c
	   dma.BufferKernAdd = vmalloc( dma.BufferSize )       ;
	   dma.BufferPhysAdd = virt_to_phys(dma.BufferKernAdd) ;
It is illegal to try and run virt_to_phys() on vmalloc()'d buffers.
It only works for memory obtained from get_free_page() and kmalloc(),
or via traversal to the physical pages, so you could walk the kernel
page tables to obtain the kernel virtual address of the underlying
physical pages, then run virt_to_bus() on each page obtained from
that scan.
Look at drivers/char/bttv.c, it shows the supported way of performing
what you are trying to do.
