Path compression isn't a big deal for multiway branching. I've usually
done it by aligning nodes and or'ing the number of levels to skip into
the lower bits of the pointer.

That would be 40:1, which is "worse" in some senses. That's not
going to fly well when pid namespaces proliferate.

I can't quite make out what you mean by all that. struct pid is already
what's in the hashtable.

Define "normally;" 10000 threads and/or processes can be standard for
some affairs.

It depends on the sort of tree used. For B+ it depends on branching
factors. For hash tries (not previously discussed) with path compression
new levels would only be created when the maximum node size is exceeded.
For radix trees (I'm thinking hand-coded) with path compression it
depends on dispersion especially above the pseudo-levels used for the
lowest bits.

Comparisons vs. no comparisons is less interesting than cachelines
touched. B+ would either make RCU inconvenient or want comparisons by
dereferencing, which raises the number of cachelines touched.

I'll look into the data structure code, then.

Path compression is no big deal and resolves the radix tree space
issues to my satisfaction. It's actuallly already in lib/radix-tree.c
but in an ineffective form. It's more to do with numbers of cachelines
touched. Having to fetch pid numbers from struct pid's is not going to
be very good on that front.

Manfred's readdir code should've dealt with that at least partially.
B+ trees also resolve that quite well, despite their other issues.
Sacrificing fully lockless RCU on B+ trees and wrapping writes with
spinlocks should allow pid numbers to be stored alongside pointers
in leaf nodes at the further cost of a branching factor reduction.
TLB will at least be conserved even with a degraded branching factor.
Anyway, I'm loath to use lib/radix-tree.c but a different radix tree
implementation I could run with. I've gone over some of the other
alternatives. Give me an idea of where you want me to go with the data
structure selection and I can sweep that up for you. I'm not attached
to any particular one, though I am repelled from one in particular
(which I can do anyway even if only for comparison purposes, though if
it happens to be best I'll concede and let it through anyway).
I can also defer the data structure switch to you if you really want
to reserve that for yourself.
