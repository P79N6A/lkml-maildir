I don't know if this is normal but:
when using vmstat 1  in single user mode free memory drops while cpu is 100% 
idle. When using top the memory drops and buffered memory inreases. When I 
quit top and go back to vmstat the same memory stats are shown.  Will the 
kernel free this so called used memory back or is the buffered memory still 
usable by the system?
I'm not show how Linux's VM works with memory usage.
Shawn.
