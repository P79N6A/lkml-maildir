Citing from:

"NFS fails at the goal of allowing a computer to access files over a 
network as if they were on a local disk. In many ways, NFS comes close 
to the objective, and in certain circumstances (detailed later), this 
is acceptable. However, the subtle differences can cause subtle bugs 
and greater system issues. The widespread misconception about the 
compatibility and transparency of NFS means that it is often used 
inappropriately, and often put into production when better, more 
acceptable solutions exist."
I don't know of a proper solution, other then writing in big letters
in the documentation about the circumstances under which you can shoot 
yourself in
the feet.
Where is NFSv4?
