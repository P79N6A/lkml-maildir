Hi,
I needed to add the line
  #include <stdarg.h>
to get util/config.c in modutils-2.3.14 to compile
I though that this was because I am using an old distribution from
slackware (still libc5), but then I tried it on a SuSE 6.1
and got the same errors.
would you consider adding
  #include <stdarg.h>
to the list of includes in config.c?
Do you have any idea why this would compile on your systems,
but not an older traditional linux system or even a new SuSE?
Before sending this I reviewed the linux-kernel recent postings,
and I see that you have been flooded, so in case you miss this,
and it may be valueable to others, I'm cc'ing linux-kernel.
Thanks,
  David Dyck
PS. the previous insmod I had installed was insmod version 2.3.5
    and I think the change was just put during the changes
    from 2.3.13 and 2.3.14
