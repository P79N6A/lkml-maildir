Interesting. This is not a theoretical problem though. I've got traces of 
the oops showing the bio getting freed before the bio_sync(bio) test. 
When you say driver here what level do you mean? scsi_request_fn at 
least drops the queue lock. 
What if it's merged instead of added directly? That could also get to
the same place.
The end_io callback _is_ getting called before __make_request 
does its "if(bio_sync(bio))" test. 
Cheers,
Phil
