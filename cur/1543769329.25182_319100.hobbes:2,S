How about this patch?  It tries to solve this race without additional
locking.  If refcount is already zero, it will increment and decrement
it.  So be careful to only call grab_namespace() with vfsmount_lock
held, otherwise it could race with itself.  (vfsmount_lock is also
needed in this case so that mnt->mnt_namespace, doesn't change, while
grabbing the namespace)
Compile tested only, please review carefully.
