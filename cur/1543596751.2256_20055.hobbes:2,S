Well, my box seems to think I'm a somebody.  If it changes it's mind,
I'll let you know.  I'll throw whatever rocks I can find at it to get
it all angry and confused.  You sneak up behind it and do the stake and
mallot number.

seems 100% repeatable here.
'scuse me while I go recompile again and hope it just goes away ;-)
