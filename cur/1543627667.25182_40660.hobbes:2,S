  Hi, all. 2.4.19-pre7 has broken the serial driver. With 2.4.19-pre6
and before, my first serial port was ttyS0 (4, 64), and I got these
kernel messages:
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A 
ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A 
With 2.4.19-pre7, my first serial port is ttyS1 (4, 65), and I get:
ttyS01 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS02 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
Was this broken by the HCDP serial ports changes?
