Just as a FYI, I had similar trouble using usb-uhci (440BX chipset) to 
a 680K using pwc/pwcx.  I had to add a bunch of error recovery (close 
/ open device, ignore open() failing and retry, etc).
I get a group of EMC messages logged , then the reset seems to take 
quite a while.
(2.4.19-pre2-ac2, but have seem this will many recent 2.4.x kernels)
