Deeply nested doesn't mean unreadable or badly structured. 1 tab in the
function, 1tab a switch, 1 if, 1 for, 1 if and you have already lost
half of the available space. It's not difficult to find lines compressed
towards the 79th column in the kernel sources.
I propose to change "hard limit" to "soft limit" to avoid things like this:
                                rc=idefloppy_begin_format(drive, inode,
                                                              file,
                                                              (int *)arg);
IMO we should try to keep function calls on the same line. btw it's
only a matter of taste and the compiler accepts ugly code too :))

Code has only one instruction per line.
