allright, I should have read the code more closely :-)
I saw drive->dn being 2 on ide1, so the code misbehaving because of
that, and thus drawn an incorrect conclusion.
Still.. the code is bogus and having an helper to get the paired device
makes sense, so all we need to do is fix the implementation of that
helper. The good thing is that I think my patch is still correct, though
the comment is not :-)
