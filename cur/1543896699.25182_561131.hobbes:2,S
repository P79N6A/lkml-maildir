Still need to run through testing, and I still don't have distcc
working. So it may take a while ;-)

I had two BUG_ON's and they were both for not having the ktaskletd_wq
allocated. If we just put a WARN_ON, we will right afterward get a BUG
from a bad memory reference, and put the system into an unknown state.
Are you sure you still want me to convert them to WARN_ON?
