I hasn't been able to make my Compaq Presario 12XL410 to work with either APM 
or ACPI. I have compiled 2.4.12 with APM and ACPI support.
With APM I can put it into standby (suspend hangs) and power it off but in no 
way I can monitor battery status.
[root@Voyager /root]# cat /proc/apm
1.14 1.2 0x03 0x01 0xff 0x80 -1% -1 ?
That "-1%" appears even when powered by battery.
As for ACPI, the /proc/sys/acpi doesn't show up even when I answered Y to all 
config questions regarding ACPI (I tried module with identical results).
The notebook is based upon VIA's Apollo chipset:
