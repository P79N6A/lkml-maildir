Even better: the zoned allocator makes it pretty easy to reserve (say)
the top 25% of memory for use only by freeable (ie. page cache and
anonymous) pages: just make a separate zone for that.  If there is
memory that you know you can reshuffle, then a slow, swapout-style
exhaustive VM search will eventually let you allocate any page you
want from that zone (barring only mlock()ed pages).
That's maybe more work than we want for a problem which may disappear
eventually of its own accord: a lot of AGP chipsets these days have a
GART which is visible from the PCI side, and that lets you map
discontiguous physical pages into a virtual region which looks
contiguous to the PCI hardware.  There's similar hardware on the Sparc
and Alpha PCI boxes (is it universal on PCI buses on those platforms?)
