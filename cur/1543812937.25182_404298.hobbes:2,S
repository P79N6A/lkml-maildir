Subject: [patch 0/4] net: percpufy frequently used vars on struct proto
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following patchset converts struct proto.memory_allocated to use batching
per-cpu counters, struct proto.sockets_allocated to use per-cpu counters and
changes the proto.inuse per-cpu variable to use alloc_percpu instead of the
NR_CPUS x cacheline size padding. 
We observed 5% improvement in apache bench requests per second with this 
patchset on a multi NIC 8 way IBM x460 box.
