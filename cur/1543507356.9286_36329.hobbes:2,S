Andrea,
if you are modifying the semaphore code, perhaps you could add something
similar to the WinNT ERESOURCE:
* single writer, multiple reader.
* schedules other threads when busy.
* you cannot call "up_rsrc()" before you called "down_rsrc()" [this is
possible with semaphores, at least on NT], so wake-one should be possible.
IIRC, Alexander Viro wrote that he might need that to fix the VFS
read()/write()/truncate() synchronization.
