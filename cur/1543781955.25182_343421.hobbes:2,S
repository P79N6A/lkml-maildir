The point is, with SCHED_OTHER scheduling, sched_yield() need not
do anything. It may not let any other tasks run.
The fact that it does on Linux is because we do attempt to do
something expected... but the simple matter is that you can't realy
on it to do what you expect.
I'm not sure exactly how you would solve the above problem, but I'm
sure it can be achieved using mutexes (for example, you could have
a queue where every thread waits on its own private mutex).... but I
don't do much userspace C programming sorry.
