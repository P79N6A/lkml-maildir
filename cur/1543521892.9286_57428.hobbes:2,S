There are already two file-systems for CD-audio on Linux :
 - cdfs at 
http://www.elis.rug.ac.be/~ronsse/cdfs/
 - audiofs at 
http://fly.cc.fer.hr/~ptolomei/audiofs/
Are you sure there is a need for a third one ?
The audiofs uses the CDROMREADAUDIO for reading the data and uses the
page-cache for caching.
I personally added the page-cache code , but I don't believe it makes a lot
of sense,
because when ripping audio, you read data sequentially , so the cache just
eats all free RAM
( possibly throwing out other more usefull  cached data ) and gives almost
no gain.
By the way , when there is a "normal" FS on a "normal" block device, does
the data get
cached twice, once in buffer-cache and once in page-cache ?
