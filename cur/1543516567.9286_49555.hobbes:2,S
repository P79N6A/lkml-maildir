Correct.
First as emploee of security company I can not discuss that here
Second I have the statistics for HPUX 10-20 715 ( 1processor) with some
security feature. The statistics is:
4500 system calls/second for UDP/IP sendto/recvfrom without context switch.
300 system calls/second with context switch. See difference ?
