It is not quite the same.
bor@itsrm2% cd foo
bor@itsrm2% sudo rmdir /tmp/foo
bor@itsrm2% ls -la .
.: No such file or directory
how do I access this? OK I could have opendir on it ... but then,
directory contents is (mur be) still there just like with any
open unlinked file.
OK, not "possible to return" - it was wrong. Is it allowed? :)
