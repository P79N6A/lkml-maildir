Obivously I spoke to soon...this doesn't fix my problem (maybe because I
don't have a p4 and cpufreq ISN'T enabled). Instead it floods my screen
with the oops now instead of staying their but from hard looking at
it..it's the exact same thing..what an annoying bug!
PS: Paul I've attached my config, any chance you could do a full serial
output on it? Hopefully that would reproduce the problem and shed some
light on it.
