Rik and I are pleased to announce version 2.0.11 of procps, the package
that contains ps, top, free, vmstat, etc.
Newer versions of procps are required for 2.5 kernels.
Most notable in this release is a handful of bug fixes, support for
/proc/pid/wchan, and an all-new free(1) implementation.
Source tarball and RPM packages are available from:
