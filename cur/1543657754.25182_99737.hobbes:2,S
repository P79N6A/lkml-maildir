In that case the thing should be within my body specifications :-)

Given what I see on sales (various out of spec drives/cables and maybe 
even controllers) I'm suspecting that some of these vendors might use 
plain trial and error cable testing...
This is why I'd prefer to have real electrical specs at hand to make my 
own checks.
