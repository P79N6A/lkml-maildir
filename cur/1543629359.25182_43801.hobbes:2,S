No no! I'm not talking about the physical address spaces. Many
CPUs have separate address spaces for separate functions. I'm
taking about the virtual address space that the process sees.
There are no holes in this virtual address space of SunOS, and
no "separate stuff" (I/O space) seen by a user-mode task.
