On overlay mode? Weird!

If bios can safely configure PCI2PCI data transfers, maybe we can
identify what bios do different and include at kernel. It is really bad
to have OOPS or data corruption if using some bad BIOS. IMHO, if we
can't safely have a way to tune pci2pci stuff at chipset, it is better
to include the hack and let the no_overlay parameter (or maybe instead a
quirk parameter at pci quirks.c) to allow user to force it.
