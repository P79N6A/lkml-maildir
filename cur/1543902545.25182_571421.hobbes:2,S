 Kernel developers like to be seen as literate. Do mind the spelling
 of kernel messages to make a good impression. Do not use crippled
-words like "dont" and use "do not" or "don't" instead.
+words like "dont"; use "do not" or "don't" instead.  Make the messages
+concise, clear, and unambiguous.
 
 Kernel messages do not have to be terminated with a period.
 
 Printing numbers in parentheses (%d) adds no value and should be avoided.
 
+There are a number of driver model diagnostic macros in <linux/device.h>
+which you should use to make sure messages are matched to the right device
+and driver, and are tagged with the right level:  dev_err(), dev_warn(),
+dev_info(), and so forth.  For messages that aren't associated with a
+particular device, <linux/kernel.h> defines pr_debug() and pr_info().
+
+Coming up with good debugging messages can be quite a challenge; and once
+you have them, they can be a huge help for remote troubleshooting.  Such
+messages should be compiled out when the DEBUG symbol is not defined (that
+is, by default they are not included).  When you use dev_dbg() or pr_debug(),
+that's automatic.  Many subsystems have Kconfig options to turn on -DDEBUG.
+A related convention uses VERBOSE_DEBUG to add dev_vdbg() messages to the
+ones already enabled by DEBUG.
