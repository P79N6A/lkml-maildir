This would be an optimization.  You could possibly _set_ values, but
obviously an 'associate' command would fail, and so it should.  But
there's really not that much of a point to doing this, because cfg80211
should support "packaging" up all the config for a particular
association request into one call, and then just blasting that to the
card.  Ideally configuration wouldn't be pushed to the card piecemeal.
As WEXT stands right now, setting the SSID on the card is essentially
the "associate" command, which obviously wouldn't work when the card is
down.  cfg80211 can fix that, you're right.

For anything other than unencrypted and WEP-only networks, you already
need a userspace program to configure your wireless card.  Dynamic WEP,
LEAP, WPA, WPA2, 802.1x all require much, much more handshake and
validation that should _ever_ be in a driver.  You should _never_, ever
be configuring your wireless card with module parameters.  I'm sure
something like iwconfig would be fine to configure your card with.
When the card goes down, it normally looses it's association to the
access point anyway, and you need to start the assocaition and
authentication over completely.  At that point, it's no longer
guaranteed that you could ever get a previous IP address back.
What does downing an ethernet device do?  It clears out routes
associated with that device, and clears assigned addresses (I think?).
Wireless is and should not be any different here.  When you bring the
device back up, you need to go through some amount of renegotiation
anyway.

That's how it should work.  If you want to change the MAC address, the
card shouldn't probably be down.
