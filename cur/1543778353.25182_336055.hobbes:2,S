Usually netlink is easily extendable by using nested TLVs. By hiding
this you basically remove this extensibility.

Netlink users don't have to care about shared or cloned skbs. I don't
think its a big issue to use alloc_skb and then the usual netlink
macros. Thomas added a number of macros that simplfiy use a lot.
But my main objection is that it sends everything to userspace even
if noone is listening. This can't be used for things that generate
lots of events, and also will get problematic is the number of users
increases.

You still have to take care of mixed 64/32 bit environments, u64 fields
for example are differently alligned.

Then fix it so we can use more families and groups. I started some work
on this, but I'm not sure if I have time to complete it.

You can still built this stuff on top, but the workarounds for netlink
limitations need to be fixed in netlink.

Wasn't me :)
