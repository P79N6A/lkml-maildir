1) Please use char arrays of some fixed size.
2) Please modify scripts/mod/file2alias.c in the kernel source, not the
module tools.  The modules.XXXmap files are deprecated: device tables
are supposed to be converted to aliases in the build process, and that
is how userspace tools like hotplug are to find them.
3) I will still accept patches to module-init-tools if required for 2.4
compatibility, but they will be going away at some point!
Hope that clarifies!
Rusty.
