No. The whole point is we should not care what it is at boot time.
It should be based on recent history of what is going on.
At boot time we read the partition table and we superblocks to mount
file systems.
That's fine to start with. So I don't see any need to add some synthetic test
to establish initial values.
The rest of the code should work regardless of what the values start out to be.
This is true for the previous proposed patch too when user space has
to decide what the right policy is.

maybe CONFIG_AUTOTUNE_RWCOST.
