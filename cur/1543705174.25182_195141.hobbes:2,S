That'd rock.  It's a very important thing nowadays.

Hmm.  Do I have to be a *new* person to ask, or can I just keep

Oi!  I'll give you five (US) dollars.  Is that near enough?  :)
Actually, in all seriousness, is there some sort of tips place
  to give you money to fund the project?  Although I don't have
  much time (working on yet another cpu governor, amongst other
  things), I can not eat at a restauraunt for lunch a couple of
  times and send the money your way.  :)

Ah.  Thankye.
A few last questions while I'm at it.  (I'm struggling to get it to work
  with my new Dell Inspiron 8600.)  Is it alright to have the different
  swsus/pmdisk versions enabled in the same kernel?  Finally, is there
  any specific way to create the swap space for saving the state to?
  I created a swap partition (/dev/hda8 fwiw), made it type 82 and
  ran mkswap on it.  However, after I tried to suspend, it didn't
  recognize the saved data.
