gcc-2.7.2.3/x86:
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
        foo(42);
}
foo(int a)
{
        printf("foo: %p\n", __builtin_return_address(0));
}
With gcc -O2 -S -fomit-frame-pointer:
foo:
        pushl 4(%esp)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^    Pushes the value of the first argument
        pushl $.LC0
        call printf
        addl $8,%esp
        ret
