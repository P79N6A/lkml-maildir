More testing on more platforms actually lead me to a slightly different 
patch, which makes a lot more sense as far as phys_cpu_present_map is 
concerned:

This has passed my testing on the following platforms:
* P3 (I820 chipset, no IO-APIC, APIC originally disabled by BIOS)
* P3 (440BX chipset, no IO-APIC, APIC originally disabled by BIOS)
* single P3 (ServerWorks OSB4 chipset, one CPU in dual CPU MB)
* dual P3 (ServerWorks OSB4 chipset, both CPU's present)
* dual P4 Xeon (I7500 chipset, both CPU's present, HT enabled)
* K7 (VIA KT400 chipset, IO-APIC present)
* K7 (VIA KM133 chipset, IO-APIC present)
* dual K7 (AMD 760MP chipset, both CPU's present)
* dual K7 (AMD 760MPX chipset, both CPU's present)
As a matter of fact, I got very interesting numbers from that printk() I
added:
- all the Intel and single proc AMD printed "0".
- all the dual AMD machines printed "1".
So the reason it was crashing on the dual Athlons is two-fold:
- It would try to write 1 into APIC_ID, when instead it should have
written (1 << 24). So it was effectively setting the APIC ID to 0.
- It would unconditionally set bit 0 in the phys_cpu_present_map bitmap, 
but later on it would check bit number boot_cpu_physical_apicid and BUG() 
if it found it clear.
So I think the patch above is safe. We could maybe replace the 
old apic_write_around() with something like
	apic_write_around(APIC_ID, (boot_cpu_physical_apicid << 24))
but it's probably unnecessary, as you said.
Ok. Enough for today. Zzzz catching time for me too...
Thanks,
Ion
