History has shown that EXPERIMENTAL tags in many areas of the kernel 
have not been maintained in a way that they would be usable as a guide.
And as soon as you need _one_ driver or feature depending on 
EXPERIMENTAL, you anyway lose all benefits it might have had.
The latter is the point where it makes sense if a user or distribution 
e.g. enables CONFIG_ATA_EXPERIMENTAL for getting all hardware supported 
but not CONFIG_CRYPTO_EXPERIMENTAL because he doesn't want to use
(resp. support usage of) experimental cryptographic algorithm 
implementations.

That's not about consensus, it's more that the number of submissions 
required until Andrew includes a patch into -mm seems to be related to 
the number of files touched...
