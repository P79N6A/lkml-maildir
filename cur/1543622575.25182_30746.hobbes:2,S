Uhh, no.
You have a configurable size for the undelete dirs and you delete a file.
Now, that file gets moved to $mountpoint/.undelete.  The daemon gets
notified through a socket, and it can check to see if it needs to delete any
older deleted files to make sure .undelete doesn't get bigger than
configured.  
We're only scanning the dirs upon daemon startup (reminds me of
quota... ;), and all other daemon actions are triggered by unlink() writing
to a socket.  The worst thing that can happen is not seeing your free space
immediately, but a few seconds later.
