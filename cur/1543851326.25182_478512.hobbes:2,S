Trivial kevent web-server can handle 3960+ req/sec on Xeon 2.4Ghz with
1Gb RAM, epoll based - 2200-2500 req/sec.
100 Mbit wire is filled almost 100% (10582.7 KB/s of data without
TCP and below headers).
More benchmarks created by me and Johann Borck can be found on project's 
homepage as long as all my sources used in tests.
