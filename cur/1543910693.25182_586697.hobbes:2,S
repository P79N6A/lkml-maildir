Forgot to answer about that: That means that the current design does not cover 
our requirement of showing process real time, even if we implement 
sched_clock? In that case I would suggest to merge my patch as a quick but 
correct solution and do it properly for 2.6.24. Of course better solutions 
are welcome :-)
