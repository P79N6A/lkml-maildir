On i386, the GFP_DMA flag controls _where_ the memory will be
allocated, namely in the low 16 MB.  This is really a relic of the
days of 24-bit ISA DMA.
On i386, the memory does not have to be non-cacheable, since in the PC
architecture the bus controller will maintain consistency by snooping
the CPU.  However, to be portable, your code should use
pci_alloc_consistent() to get memory for DMAing.  This will do the
right thing on all platforms, including making sure that the memory is
non-cacheable on architectures where the bus controller does not snoop.
(By the way, kmalloc() will always return contiguous memory, but you
should still use pci_alloc_consistent for DMA memory)
