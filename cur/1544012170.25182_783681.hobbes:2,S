Hi
I had a bit of an accident, and wondered if somebody already had to try to extract the initramfs image from an existing vmlinuz?
 I did try google, but either my search terms was not right, or nobody really touched on the subject before, because all the results mostly dealt with an external image.
Any advice will be appreciated.
Thanks
MS
