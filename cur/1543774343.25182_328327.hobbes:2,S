Nikita, I respectfully disagree with what you say about the state of our
atomicity code.   It is not so far away as you describe, and probably 6
man weeks work could polish it off.  You don't see the value in what I
define as useful, namely atomicity without isolation.  Since you don't
see that, it is harder for you to see that something is close to working
and just needs 6 weeks of someone who groks what I am asking for.
