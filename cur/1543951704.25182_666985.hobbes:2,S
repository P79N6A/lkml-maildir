Crazy idea. How about we add support for sym links to the cgroup fs ?
It's still much cleaner imo than dealing with complex irq grouping schemes.
In other words with symlinks we could do
`-- cpuset
     |-- A -> X/A
     |-- B -> X/B
     |-- C
     `-- X
         |-- A
         `-- B
The software that is used to the flat structure won't know the difference.
