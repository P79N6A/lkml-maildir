The Linux Security Modules project provides a lightweight, general purpose
framework for access control.  The LSM interface enables developing
security policies as loadable kernel modules.  See 
http://lsm.immunix.org
for more information.
2.5.71-lsm1 patch released.  This is an update up to 2.5.71 as well as
some module updates, and various cleanups.  In line with other struct
sock changes in 2.5.71, the sock->security field is now called
sk_security.
