Further info. This behaviour, although it is allowed by POSIX, is not
*specified*, as such, by it (ah! ambiguity! life would be so dull
without you!), and is not replicated by any other C library on the face
of the planet.
Further, it's not even the behaviour of glibc, as such.
It's the behaviour of glibc 2.6.x as patched with this Debian-specific
patch:

`----
This patch also breaks at least bash and zsh as well as nfs-utils (see
<
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=429021>
) and I sort of
suspect it's not long for this world as a result.
So this is much less nasty than we feared (well, and more nasty if you
happen to be a Debian unstable or testing user).
