Linas, the main consumer of error-log is events coming in from
event-scan.  We don't call event-scan until rtasd is up (eg they are
queued in FW until we call event-scan).  The only events I see us
missing are epow events, eeh? and anything coming from check-exception. 
epow is set up pretty late as well, and I don't think we even support
check-exception on 2.6.  eeh might be an issue.

Paul,
We can initialize nvram very early, but we shouldn't discard an event
stored in nvram until rtasd is up and can pull the event out as it might
have been the error that took the system down on the previous boot.
We could probably start rtasd up a little earlier, but I'm not sure it
buys us that much.
Thanks,
Jake
