It's a bug which was introduced months ago when we added struct
reclaim_state.

I had a patch which fixes it in -mm for a while.  It does increase the
number of pages which are reclaimed via direct reclaim and decreases the
number of pages which are reclaimed by kswapd.  As one would expect from
throttling kswapd.  This seems undesirable.
I'm leaving this alone until it can be demonstrated that fixing it improves
kernel behaviour in some manner.
