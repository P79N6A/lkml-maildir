A different personal opinion:  I'd prefer a compiler than can be told
either to run fast and produce correct but suboptimal code or to
produce the fastest correct code it can.
While developing, the compile/test/think/edit cycle is dominated by compile
time for me.  So fast compilation is important while developing
algorithms.
