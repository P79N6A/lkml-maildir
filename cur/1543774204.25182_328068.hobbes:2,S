Since this did not get an answer, and since it is the technical email in
the flamefest, I thought I would resend it appropriately labeled.
Correct me if I am wrong:
What exists currently in VFS are vector instances, not classes. Plugins,
selected by pluginids, are vector classes, with each pluginid selecting
a vector class. You propose to have the vector class layer (aka plugin
layer) in reiser4 export the vector instance to VFS for VFS to handle
for each object, rather than having VFS select reiser4 and reiser4
selecting a vector class (aka plugin) which selects a method.
If we agree on the above, then I will comment further.
