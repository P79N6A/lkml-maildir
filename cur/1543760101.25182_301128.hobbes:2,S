I don't think so. The latest patch (2.6.11.2 now) is on the frontpage of 
kernel.org, so IMHO the user should not need to search the kernel.org/pub 
archives to get 2.6.11.1 patch before he can start working with 2.6.11.2.
I think it's a small problem too, that 2.6.11 source isn't directly accessable 
through the kernel.org frontpage while there is no "full tarball" of 2.6.11.X 
trees.
