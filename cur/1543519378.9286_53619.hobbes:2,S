Hi,
    Here is some more information on the register spill problem mentioned
for FD_ZERO() macro and the sysvinit v2.76 tarball.
    In addition to the above problem, the spill is also occuring for
wu-ftpd-2.6.0    and libgcj v2.95.1 tarballs which require this
FD_ZERO() too.
    If this is occuring for the i386 Intel platform, it probably is
occurring for the other various platforms too.
