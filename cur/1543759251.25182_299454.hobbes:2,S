elinks doesn't show any of the "fail" in the matrix as links - this
seems to be using javascript.
In fact there doesn't appear to be a reason to use javascript for
this - it seems to be implementing a standard link to:
	
http://l4x.org/k/?d=<number>
which can be done just as well with standard HTML without need to
resort to javascript.  Plus it works with a wider range of browsers.
Including those used by certain blind developers in this community
who are completely unable to use any form of GUI.
