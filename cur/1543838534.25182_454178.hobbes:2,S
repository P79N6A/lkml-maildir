(these oopsen would be a heck of a lot easier to look at if the
timestamp junk was stripped off)

The oops doesn't help much.  Once again, eip is in lala land, not the
kernel.
Given that you're the only person posting this kind of explosion, I
would cast a very skeptical glance toward my hardware.  I'd suggest
reverting to a known good kernel first, to verify that you really don't
have a hardware problem cropping up.
After I did that, I'd enable stack check thingies under kernel hacking,
and if that didn't turn up anything, I'd try slab and page allocator
debugging options and hope to catch someone scribbling where they're not
supposed to.
