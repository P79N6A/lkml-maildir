Just a quick note to say that 2.6.0-test7 is the first kernel I've been
able to successfully suspend to disk with and then resume. Using
"echo -n disk > /sys/power/state" now works just fine and I haven't
needed to reboot my laptop (a Compaq Evo N200) since I started running
the kernel last week. Thanks!
