Funny (not), I noticed almost the same problem with a Firewire 250GB HD
(Maxtor). The data has been written to it (FAT32, 200gb-Partition), but
large files (IMO >= 1GB) got zero size and the data disappeared.
Scandisk from Windows could not find any errors, however the displayed
free space on this FAT filesystem has been lowered by the ammount of the
data written too it :(
I will try fsck.vfat later.
MfG,
Eduard.
