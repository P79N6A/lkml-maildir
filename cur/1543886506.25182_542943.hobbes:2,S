Davide Libenzi has a testcase which can essentially do this sort of
test involving sleep/wakeup behavior for you.

Usually things appear fairer over longer than shorter intervals. One
could regard the rate of convergence as a sort of performance metric
for the fairness of a scheduler, provided it converges to fairness at
all.

Bear in mind that bandwidth credits have soundness issues. Crediting
bandwidth in exchange for sleep will certainly flunk ringtest.c
Crediting latency in exchange for sleep at least has different problems
if it has any at all. I actually expect it to be sound to credit
latency (the l_i in EEVDF) in exchange for sleep, but the experts have
yet to weigh in on the subject.
