Thanks Andrew,
yes I'm using RAID:
# cat /proc/mdstat

This is a pretty standard configuration for me here, I use it almost
everywhere as a mean to protect data from simple disk failures (that are
way to common these days). I have at least 5-6 servers at hand, all with
disk mirroring. Some of them match the version exactly, and the hardware
is very similar, but there was only one host showing the leak. Two
things are different on the affected server:
- it uses the dc395x driver (only a DAT device is attached);
- it's a database (PostgreSQL) server (that is, with some shm usage).
The dc395x sometimes spits some error messages:
Jun 28 05:37:47 xxxx kernel: dc395x: Interrupt from DMA engine: 0x63!
Jun 28 05:37:47 xxxx kernel: dc395x: Ignoring DMA error (probably a bad
thing) ...
I have to live with those for now. They seem to be harmless. The same
messages occur with 2.6.12.1, but the bio leak is gone (or so it seems
after 1 day of uptime), I guess they may be unrelated (the dc395x driver
used to be my suspect #1).

I'm sorry, but I'm missing something: I'm not able to locate that piece
of code in neither the (FC2) linux-2.6.10 tree nor the (unpatched)
linux-2.6.12.1 tree. There's no super_written() function at all, BTW.
The code looks completely different.
[...google digging...]
Is it related to this patch?
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-raid&m=111155701929593&w=2
If so, I don't think I'm using it.
But the symptoms looks like the same.
Anyway, it seems solved in 2.6.12.1, so I'm not that worried. I'll wait
and see if after the upgrade to FC4 the problem is still there (with the
official FC4 kernel). I'll bring the issue to the Fedora lists, in case.
As far as I can see, the problem is already solved in mainstream. Thanks
again.
