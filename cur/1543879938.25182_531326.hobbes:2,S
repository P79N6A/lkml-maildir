(Note that this problem will be a lot harder to provoke once Tejun's
changes to sysfs are in place.  But it will still be possible, unless we 
make similar changes to all the other filesystems as well.)
There are three possible approaches to this problem:
     1. Ignore it, as we do now.  If someone actually tries running your
	example above, an oops will result when the kobject's release
	method is called after my_module has been unloaded from memory.
     2. Do what Cornelia suggested, and allow the example to deadlock.
     3. Change the module code so that rmmod can return _before_ the
	module is actually unloaded from memory (but after the module's
	exit routine has completed).  This will lead to more problems.
	For example, what if someone tries to modprobe my_module back
	again before it has finished unloading?
My feeling is that either a deadlock or more complications with modprobe 
would be preferable to an oops.  Your opinion may differ.
(Also, doing this might be a good way to expose a lot of hidden 
refcounting bugs.  They will become very obvious when rmmod hangs.)
