That is the truth! No one would have complained if they went away in 2.5. 
But now people are using ipchains (it was the default Redhat firewall for
a while even after iptables came out).

Actually one of the reasons I use 2.6, in many cases it resists hangs
which occur in 2.4. Thank Ingo, Nick and Con for that (and others) making
the scheduler far better at "plays well with others." Between the O(1)
scheduler and the HT fixes, and the various large and small tweaks of
everyone, 2.6 runs well on both large and small machines compared to 2.4.
Yes, there are exceptions.
