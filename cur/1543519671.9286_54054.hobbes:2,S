Running less than 5 minutes, I got:
Dec 17 10:04:42 perfect kernel: hdc: multwrite_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady
SeekComplete }
Dec 17 10:04:42 perfect kernel: hdc: buffer list corrupted

SeekComplete }
Dec 17 10:04:42 perfect kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:01 (hdc),
sector 163900
Dec 17 10:04:42 perfect kernel: IO error syncing ext2 inode
[ide1(22,1):000028a1]
Kernel built with gcc 2.7.2.3. 
Is it possible this is connected with using "hdparm -W 1"?
