Some things will panic there, just deeper in the call chain.

Other functions can also panic on failure after this, e.g. tcp_init().
I think ideally it'd be best if components did not panic during 
initialization unless it _really_ meant that the kernel should not 
continue executing.  Although, it's not entirely clear how to determine 
this, e.g. perhaps the system should panic if netfilter initialization 
failed, as it might mean that the systems comes up without a firewall. But 
how do we know precisely which components are being used for security 
critical purposes?
It seems like a signifcant overhaul of existing code, so probably best 
just to leave yours as-is (which I suspect is the correct behavior 
anyway).
