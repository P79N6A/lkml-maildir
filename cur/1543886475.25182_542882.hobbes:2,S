The req->hard_nr_sectors is specifically marked block layer internal and 
since nr_sectors is what we're requesting and reading (we can't deal with 
partial transfers anyway since the drive won't tell us where it failed as 
far as I've been able to see and we do want to make read requests for as 
many sectors as possible at a time for speed) I believe that in our case the 
nr_sectors is fine.
