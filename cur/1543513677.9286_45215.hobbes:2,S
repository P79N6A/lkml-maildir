Hi,
this is a re-re-re-repost. I hope someone hears me now.
I have EXTREME problems with NFS under a mixture of 2.2.1{2..3} machines.
First symptoms were that mount -at nfs would segfault or throw an oops. (I
posted this here about a month ago.) Now, nothing oopses, everything mounts
ok, but EVERY NFS LINK dies after a couple minutes (~10). I get "NFS server
not responding" in the syslog, and every process accessing /home (or NFS
mounted dir) gets stuck, is unkill-9able, unstoppable, and doesn't wake up
any more, even if I restart the NFS server - although the syslog would
print "NFS server <<<>>> OK" after some time.
This is extremely annoying, partly because I am in the process of migrating
a Windows network to Linux+NFS and certain people start snickering at Linux
mumbling things about stability etc.
PLEASE tell me what I am doing wrong. Except for the above, I cannot print
any syslog output, and I have posted to the list about three or four times
with 20k of system information and logs, so I don't really want to do it
again.
Thanks a lot!
