Yes, the old 2.6 radeon driver works, but has the transient screen
corruption problem that you fixed in 2.4 a while ago:

Backlight is enabled. It is possible to change the backlight intensity
using Fn-F8 and Fn-F9, but it is not possible to completely turn off
backlight from the BIOS/keyboard. Changing the intensity works both
from within X and from the black console, but doesn't cure the
problem.

It's a "Clevo 5600P" sold as a "Best 5650". More details at:
