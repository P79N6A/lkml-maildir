I don't think that LAN is of any importance for our problems. 
But I was told (see previous messages) that the fact that all memory slots
are connedted to one CPU makes a non-NUMA board of it (S2875).

I see.

IIRC [I might be wrong], Andrew is running this board (S2885) with exactly
this memory configuration without problems.
