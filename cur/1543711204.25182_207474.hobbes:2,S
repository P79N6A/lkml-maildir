triflex.c driver is converted but pci_device_id table is in triflex.h.
cmd640.c may be hard to convert due to fact that this chipset
doesn't support config write cycles (more details in cmd640.c).
You missed cs5520.c, cs5530.c and freshly added atiixp.c.
Anyway I corrected the patch and pushed it to Linus, thanks!
