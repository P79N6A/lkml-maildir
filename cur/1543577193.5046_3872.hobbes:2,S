Alan,
    I have linux 2.2.19pre5 on a UMSDOS based Dell Optiplex Gx1 using
libc5 v2.0.7. Below is my "lsmod" of all modules loaded.
Note: the  cpuid module when it isn'tloaded and oopsing the kernel is
fixed now. However, I found a new problem in /proc.
A). Problem:   If you "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush" you'll get
     Invalid argument as an error message. This is a zero length file
     (as expected) and I'm not sure what it is supposed to contain.
     I can send my kernel ".config" file if you can't duplicate this one.
     Note: I do have a regular T1 internet connection, even though I have
     the ppp and slip stuff loaded -- these modules aren't being used.
