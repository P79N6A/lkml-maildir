Well that looks closer to the iterator here than some of the eariler
links.  The apply_to_page_range is pretty trivial, will have to look at
Paul's patches to see if there's something we can use.  This is just for
Xen's use ATM, so we can always revert to keeping it Xen local if Paul's
changes are heading upstream, and use them once they're in.
