Subject: Wanted: small number of crazy highpoint IDE  (HPT366-372N/374) controller owners
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've been debugging and chasing down various HPT IDE problems. I've done
some cleanups, fixed the PLL tune and little bits like that. These are
the kind of changes that turn your disk into a random number generator
if they go wrong but OTOH the HPT372N crashes should be fixed.
Now it needs some testers...
