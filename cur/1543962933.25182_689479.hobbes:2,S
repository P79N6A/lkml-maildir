i just used the existing precedent of doing the #ifdef: it's not _that_ 
bad as it surrounds a single function most of the time so it's rather 
apparent what is happening - and that is what is done in some other 
drivers as well.
btw., when i fixed this i almost implemented it the way that you 
suggested, but there's also a code size argument to when the suspend 
callbacks are not used: the extra dummy function takes up text space, 
and people turn off PNP when they build some specialized thing and try 
to reduce the size of the kernel.
but in any case, i have no strong feelings in either direction.
