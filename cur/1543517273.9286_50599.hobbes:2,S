No problem.

In the driver you will see
/*
 * Debug flags.
 */
#undef DEBUG
Change that to #define DEBUG. This will give extra output. Also boot with
vgacon and have atyfb built as a module. Then do a 
/sbin/insmod atyfb.o vc:0-0 
This way you will only lose the first console if the driver bombs. Then
you can switch to another console and look at the log files debug info to
see what happened.

I have one question. The linux console system has no real multihead
support. So even if you have more than one framebuffer device all the 32
possible virtual consoles will be allocated to the first
framebuffer. Their is program called con2fbmap that maps VCs to a another
framebuffer. Most likely even with both framebuffer compiled in they are
all allocated to the same to the one fbdev that crapping out on you.

Ah. Sounds like what I said above. Sounds like your atyfb is the problem.

If you mean at boot time then yes. Read linux/Documentation/fb/modedb.txt.

From what you said it sounds like your problem is the atyfb driver and not
the aty128fb driver. Try teh atyfb driver as amoduel and insmod it with
DEBUG enabled.
