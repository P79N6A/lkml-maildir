This is clearly a bug, but due to (almost) no one
ever checking the return value, it has gone unnoticed.

I agree with this change.  I think it fits with how
the size is returned from printf in user space,
which can be greater than the length of the format
string when values are replaced in the string.  So
at least for printf, there is a precedent for returning a
number greater than the length of the submitted string.
