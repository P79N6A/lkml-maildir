experience report :
In June 2004 we migrated to CF after bad hard disk crashes experience...
Most of the CF do NOT do wear leveling, you have to ask the manufacturer
if it does it or not, generally it is called industrial... and normally,
cost much more .
So, for low cost cf I assume you have to do wear leveling with the
kernel ...otherwise it is already "wear leveling inside"
Since the technology evolves very fast it may be possible today that the
production's cost of wear leveled CF will be the same as standard one
and wear leveling will be a standard ?
I think it should be possible to know if the Cf supports wear leveling
using the the identify device command (0xEC) and look at words 82 to 87 
(cf. CF specifications 
http://www.compactflash.org/specdl1.htm
)
Depending on the application, some system hacks like noatime... need to
be setted up.
we use  silicon systems CF  with wear leveling inside  , we write a few
kb data back each 1/4 h  on it.(log /tmp files  are redirected to ram)
Since June 2004 ALL  hard disk  systems based replaced with CF (env. 100
units)   have not failed.
If somebody could report experience with other brand CF including wear
leveling , it will be fine
some other brand I know only the name :
www.apro-tw.com
http://www.afaya.com.tw/
 (spec tells it supports wear leveling)
