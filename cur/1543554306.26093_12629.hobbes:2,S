[This goes out of subject]
I have learned that load avarage means
	"Processes on run queue" + 
	"process waiting disk (or short-term) I/O"
That was before Linux times.
I have seen a workstation go to show load-average 100.
That happened when NFS-server (or network) died. These
workstations were diskless, so all processes ended to
waiting of "disk" I/O.
These were Sun's diskless workstation models.
So it is not new that load average includes something else than
processes waiting for CPU.
