Hmmm ... I'm not sure that being that restrictive is going to help.
Whilst bugs against any randomly patched version of the kernel
probably aren't that interesting, things in major trees like -mm, 
-ac, -dj etc are likely going to end up in mainline sooner or later
anyway ... wouldn't you rather know of the breakage sooner rather
than later?
Recall when some random idiot broke sparc64 by mucking with 
free_area_init_node? Those changes had been sitting in -mm tree
for a while ;-) (and yes, that was me).
