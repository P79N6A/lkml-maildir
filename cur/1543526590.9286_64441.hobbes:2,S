Yes, but none of this will result in the data being revealed, and that was
what MIke wanted to achieve:
encrypted_file(fs) -> read_encrypted_chunk
encrypted_chunk -> send_over_encrypted_link 
remote_end -> receive_double_encrypted_data -> decode_the_transmission_data
encrypted_chunk_decode -> real_data
The data is out of reach of the local root.
