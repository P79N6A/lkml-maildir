	I`ve experienced a very strange relationship between
ISA sb card generated interrupts and network NIC perfomance.
	The situation was the next: i`ve performed a data transfer from
a remote samba share to the local box thru a 10Mbit ISA NIC.
What has been varying was the interrupt load of the sound card.
With esd started the sound card generated 500-600 interrupts/second,
with no esd, it didnt generated interrupts.
	Theoretically the sbcard interrupts should make the NIC starve
and reduce the NIC performance. But the situation i`ve experienced
was weird as hell.
	With esd started the samba transfer maxes out at 400kb/s.
	With esd stopped it immediately drops down to 30-35 kb/s.
This is also well reflected by the NIC interrupt rate cutting down
by 90% with esd stopped.
	Info: linux-2.4.17-rmap12e, NE2k ISA NIC, SB16 Vibra ISA
