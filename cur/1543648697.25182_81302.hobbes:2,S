I'm a C-programmer. I've looked at C++ a long time ago. 
Turns out that my system also supports C++. I still don't care. 
Turns out that C++ specifies that some code should be run before main
starts. 
It seems that if I happen to link with a library that uses C++
internally, some code in that library can get run before my first
statement in main.  Suddenly it IS my problem. 
NOT GOOD. 
If capabilities are correctly implemented, having "all" capabilities
will mean that it's equivalent to "setuid-root". Nothing worse than
what we have now. I can currently decide to take the setuid-ness of
mount away. I can currently decide to install a setuid bit on "lilo".
That is the flexibility of having it in the filesystem.
