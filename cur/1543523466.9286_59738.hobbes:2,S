I'd like to ask, why? Even double is only 8 bytes. Does this mean that 12
bytes is wasted each argumentless call and -fno-omit-frame-pointer, for
saving ebp?
And as we got into gcc flags for compiling kernel (or anything) i'd like
to mention that aligning code has no effect on plain Pentium. Should use
-malign-loops/jumps=0 instead of 2 (is this still 2 for newest kernels?).
