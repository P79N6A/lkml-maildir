Yes, that's true - the contexts would be subjected to a permission
check.  But that's separable from the act of setting it as the task's
acting security state (and needs to be separated, as the precise check
will vary depending on the situation - cachefiles is going to apply a
different sort of check than nfsd).

LSM is an in-kernel interface.  Here we are talking about a userspace
interface for obtaining the right security label to use.  There is no
equivalent to LSM in userspace as of yet.  Feel free to invent one, but
don't ask the rest of us to do it or wait for it to materialize.
