I keep hearing this without a reason. Assuming you filter incoming
packets and don't allow random insecure machines on your network,
just how is NFS insecure? You'd have to attack it with some kind of
multi-machine hard link race condition I think. (but inode generation
numbers might seal that too)

With ACLs, stuff does break a bit.
Capabilities are no problem though, as long as you keep them out of
the filesystem. The executable header method won't break with tar.
