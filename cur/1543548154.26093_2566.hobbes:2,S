Just had an ext2 filesystem on SCSI that was corrupt.  The first two
words of the group descriptor had been overwritten with 0xdeadbeef,
0x00000000.  The filesystem is fixed now but trying to track down the
problem is difficult, there are 50+ places in the kernel that use
0xdeadbeef.
I strongly suggest that people use different variants of dead beef to
make it easier to work out where any corruption is coming from.
Perhaps change the last 2-3 digits so magic values would be 0xdeadb000
to 0xdeadbfff, assuming it does not affect any other code.
