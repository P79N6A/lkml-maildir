	There are modules outside of the drivers directory, so I mean
to mirror /usr/src/linux.   For example, I might want to be able to
specify "all networking modules."

	Probably.  In any case, this way, future changes of the
/usr/src/linux directory tree layout would only have to be made in
one place and would not require new releases of modutils as such
changes were made.

	Such an XML file would have to keep track of the names of
new modules as they are developed, and it would create two places
where such information would have to be updated instead of one.  By
making the /lib/modules/<version> tree mirror /usr/src/linux, that will
enable programs that only need to be updates when the actual directory
layout changes.
	Thanks for your input, by the way.
