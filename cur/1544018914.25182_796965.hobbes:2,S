Yes, but that's fundamentally fragile: anyone who happens to stick the 
wrong thing into keventd (and it's dead easy because schedule_work() is 
easy to use) will lock up work_on_cpu() users.
work_on_cpu() is an important (and lowlevel enough) facility to be 
isolated from casual interaction like that.

This fixes lockups during bootup caused by the cpumask changes/cleanups 
which changed set_cpus_allowed()+on-kernel-stack-cpumask_t to 
work_on_cpu().
Which was fine except it didnt take into account the interaction with the 
kevents workqueue and the very wide cross section for worklet dependencies 
that this brings with itself. work_on_cpu() was rarely used before so this 
didnt show up.
