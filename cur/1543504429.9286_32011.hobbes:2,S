Bummer that we just duplicated all that work; I've been sitting on a
patch that does the exact same thing since late 2.2. :)
(check the l-k archives or

)
Doesn't seem like anyone is too interested in applying it yet though; I've
brought it up here on l-k two or three times without much support.
Ah well, at least I know now that I'm not the only one that despises as86.
