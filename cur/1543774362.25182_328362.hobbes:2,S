Subject: Finding what change broke ARM

When building current git for ARM, I see:
  CC      arch/arm/mm/consistent.o
arch/arm/mm/consistent.c: In function `dma_free_coherent':
arch/arm/mm/consistent.c:357: error: `mem_map' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/arm/mm/consistent.c:357: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
arch/arm/mm/consistent.c:357: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [arch/arm/mm/consistent.o] Error 1
How can I find what change elsewhere in the kernel tree caused this
breakage?
With bk, you could ask for a per-file revision history of the likely
candidates, and then find the changeset to view the other related
changes.
With git... ?  We don't have per-file revision history so...
