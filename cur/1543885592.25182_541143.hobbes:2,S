I'm not getting what problem you are trying to solve.
Kconfig has always printed all symbols in the dependency circle, and 
with this information it was never a problem to locate what went wrong.
The only thing that was missing was that the error often wasn't detected 
since it scroled away, so we need to error out.
I have no problem with more information being printed, but at least for 
me it isn't required since grep'ing for it is trivial.
