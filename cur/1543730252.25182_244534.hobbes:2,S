Yes. It *is* for debuging/tracing in kernel space but like DTrace is 
*also* in user space.

Look on some time stamps both projects.
Seems KProbes is clone DTrace ..

The same is KProbes but you can combined with small programs associated 
with called probes. Again: DTrace/KProbes is much more than traditional
profiling/tracing/measuring tools.

KProbes patches was annouced on lkml few times.
