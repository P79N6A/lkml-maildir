Hummm.. shmem_alloc_pages version only uses the vma as a placeholder 
for memory policies. So we would put the page on a vma that is on the 
stack? That would mean changing the mapping of the page? Is that safe?
And then later we would be changing the mapping back to the old vma?
What guarantees that the old vma is not gone by then?
