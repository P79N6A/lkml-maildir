I really don't like this change. It is completely useless because you
can get the pt_regs as well from the stack.  Please don't add it.
George's stub also didn't need it.

Similar. No such crap please.

This should be a notify_die.

That's complete crap. You have a debugger hook and you add your own
hook one line before it. Please fix that.
I note that the old stub in -mm* didn't need such wards.

Same issue here. All the CHK_DEBUGGER are redundant with notify_die.

This should not be needed

That's completely broken too. We have a full CFI description in the kernel
now, so this isn't needed anymore.
