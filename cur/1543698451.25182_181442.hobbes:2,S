Hi,
With 2.4.22, my Supermicro X5DPL-iGM-O (E7501 chipset) with 2 
xeons@2.4ghz and hypertherading enabled shows 4 cpu's in 
/proc/cpuinfo|proc/interrupts, with:
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY=y
The same config with 2.4.23 only shows 2 cpus, even with:
CONFIG_NR_CPUS=4
Also, I believe this has been reported before, but the system only seems 
to interrupt on CPU0 with either kernel, unless I apply a patch I found 
here:
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/2.4.22/irqbalance-2.4.22-MRC.patch
or run the `irqbalance' program.. which I don't care to do.  This 
problem _seems_ to be isolated to the Supermicro, as HT does seem 
properly detected on several other SMP systems I have at work (compaq 
ML370/ML380) with 2.4.23
