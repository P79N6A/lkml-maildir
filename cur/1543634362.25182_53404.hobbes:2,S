It's intensely useful.  It changes the whole character of the VM discussion 
at the upcoming kernel summit from 'should we port rmap to mainline?' to 'how 
well does it work' and 'what problems need fixing'.  Much more useful.
Your timing is impeccable.  You really need to cc Linus on this work, 
particularly your minimal, lru version.
