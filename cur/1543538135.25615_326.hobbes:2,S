    My question is: is there any tools under Linux that can automatically
    repair such kinda of disk failure and recover the windows98 system
    (someone needs it to send email coz I got a motorola soft modem). I know I
    can do it by "dd" and partition table correction. Just wonder if there is
    such a cool software that does the job already. 
I don't think so -- doesn't w2k do bad thing to bootsectors if your
not careful?
    P.S. any bios function call C library available for Linux? That way, I
    might just write code myself to do it? Or do I have to start from assembly
    code? :-\
BIOS functions are not available -- and you don't need assembly.
Under linux, you open the device and seek/read/write like any file.
Check out the source code to fdisk or something.
