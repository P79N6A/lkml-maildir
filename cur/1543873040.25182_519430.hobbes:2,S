Subject: [PATCH] Remove CHILD_MAX
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The CHILD_MAX macro in limits.h should not be there.  It claims to be the
limit on processes a user can own, but its value is wrong for that.
There is no constant value, but a variable resource limit (RLIMIT_NPROC).
Nothing in the kernel uses CHILD_MAX.
The proper thing to do according to POSIX is not to define CHILD_MAX at all.
The sysconf (_SC_CHILD_MAX) implementation works by calling getrlimit.
