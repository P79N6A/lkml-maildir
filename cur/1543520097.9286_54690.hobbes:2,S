Right. I'm just so used to the internal kernel logic that I no longer even
remember how it was done in user land..
The kernel way of returning errors has obviously shown itself to be the
much nicer one - imagine how much easier threading UNIX would have been if
we didn't have that one "errno" global - it's one of the few fundamental
globals used in standard libraries. But I'm not going to re-make all
existing programs and standards ;)
