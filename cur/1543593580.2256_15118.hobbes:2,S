Just FYI (I think it's S3 Virge specific, but maybe not), I solved my RX
packets loss on my ADSL interface after I read the message
        
http://www.xfree86.org/pipermail/xpert/2000-November/003402.html
and used
Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Generic Video Card"
        Driver          "s3virge"
        Option "fpm_vram"
        Option "fifo_aggressive"
        Option "pci_burst" "on"
        Option "pci_retry" "on"
        Option "XaaNoCPUToScreenColorExpandFill"
EndSection
in my XFConfig-4.
(The whole thread seems to be worth a read.)
Best regards,
Pierre.
