I've actually seen that before on different systems. Sometimes
under some IO loads writes can be really starved for that long
and they block the calling process. Normally it only happened
when a very slow IO device (like slow USB storage) was involved
e.g. typical trace:
sshd          D ffff810001072b20     0 11554   3381         11556 11127 (NOTLB)

I've got quite a lot of processes in journal_start -> start_this_handle.
I suppose they're waiting for the transaction to finish.

Nothing in dmesg except for the sysrqs I triggered.

And print something, yes.
I assume it wasn't the driver for now.
Thanks for your work.
