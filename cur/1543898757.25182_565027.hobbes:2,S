This whole stuff (and calls to netconsole_target_get and _put from code
below) is not necessary. All the access to the netconsole_target objects
(that are present in the target_list) happens inside
spin_lock_irqsave(target_list_lock), so there's no need to do a
config_item_get() on these as there is no race window in which userspace
can delete (and thus release) these items from under us. Note that
drop_netconsole_target() removes target-to-delete from target_list
(under spin_lock_irqsave) _before_ free'ing the objects, and that both
_get() and _put() are balanced *inside* a spin_lock_irqsave /
spin_unlock_irqrestore pair -- so all this business is quite pointless.
I've kept this stuff in for now, but would like to get rid of it, really.
It's an unnecessary #ifdef-#else-#endif kludge. Comments?

[ Such code exists in all the store() operations for all attributes other
than "enabled" itself. ]
Anyway, the problem is that the error does not show up violently in the
shell. The write fails, of course, values are unchanged, and dmesg shows
the diagnostic outputted above -- but "echo" does not complain about
-EINVAL returning from write(2) for some reason, neither did -EACCES.
I guess "echo" needs to be fixed. BTW would -EACCES be more appropriate?
