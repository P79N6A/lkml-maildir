Okay and agreed.

Well, let's put it this way.  In general, would you agree that the bulk
of Linux servers on the internet run apache?  It's also not hard to
assume that many of these also run apache+php or apache+mod_perl.
Apache has lots of modules and code that can easily be shared between
processes.  Especially when you use mod_perl or php.  This sharing
significantly effects the memory footprint and saves us all from having
gigabytes of memory that we don't really need.  My apache2 processes
have a VSS of around 120MB!
The capacity of a web serving machine is some combination of CPU,
Memory, and IO bandwidth.  Being able to measure the copy-on-write pages
for processes is a key variable to determining a machine capacity.  This
figure changes over the life of the process as well, and can be used to
tell children to exit once they reach a certain point.
Now, about keeping it in the vanilla kernel:  AFAIK, the only way to
acquire this information is from the kernel.  It's useful to developers,
and available on most other platforms.  Copy on write pages make sense,
why waste tons of RAM when there is no real need?  It makes sense to be
able to observe this behavior, and the information can guide developers
to make their applications more efficient.
In many organizations developers do not have the ability/skill to make
custom kernels.  They are given development platforms, told to write
their applications, and so on and so on.  Patching the kernel for
keeping track of cow's and subsequently maintaining that patch really
doesn't help them much.  I could go on but this is getting a bit off
topic.
Best,
Richard Rebel
