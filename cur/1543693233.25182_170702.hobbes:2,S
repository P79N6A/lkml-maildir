You could do all of this from an LSM, except that the LSM exits are restrictive
rather than authoritative.  The upshot is that if an open() syscall fails due
to file permissions, the LSM exit is never called, so you won't get an audit
record that way - you need a more invasive patch for that.
Read the LSM archives, there's a lot of discussion of doing auditing in there,
much of it revolving around the fact that proper audit makes for one hell of an
invasive patch.  Now that LSM is in for 2.6, it *might* be feasible to discuss
audit for 2.7/8.
You probably want to port your patch to the 2.6 tree, as more development is
going on there.
