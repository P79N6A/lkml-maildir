ec_intr=0 is a reasonable workaround for this box,
if we couldn't root-cause and fix the real problem on time.

No, don't do this.  There are other laptops need this. And I didn't
get regression report that is root-caused to enabling ec_intr=1 by
default. If you argue bug 5989, 6075 could be,  I think
the truth is, for 5989, we need to fix thermal and processor driver
issue.
for 6075, we need to fix interrupt issue.
So far, I don't think we need o fall back.
Thanks,
Luming
