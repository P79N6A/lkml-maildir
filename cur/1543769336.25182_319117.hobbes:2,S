Probably. It might be worth defining an atomic_cmpxchg() op to formalise it
though:
	int atomic_cmpxchg(atomic_t *p, int old, int new);
The main reason for this is that atomic_t is mostly a 32-bit value, I think,
and cmpxchg() may sometimes enforce a 64-bit value.
It can be made to work on PPC, PPC64, x86, x86_64, frv. I imagine it'll work
on MIPS, sparc and alpha too without too much trouble. Dunno about the rest.
