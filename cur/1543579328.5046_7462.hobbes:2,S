Just a little FYI, I wanted to point out that 6.08 BETA fixed a problem 
I've been having since the 2.4.0-test series on a machine with the 
following adaptec integrated controller:
   Bus  4, device   7, function  0:
     SCSI storage controller: Adaptec 7899P (rev 1).
       IRQ 19.
       Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=40.Max Lat=25.
       I/O at 0x5000 [0x50ff].
       Non-prefetchable 64 bit memory at 0xf7e00000 [0xf7e00fff].
   Bus  4, device   7, function  1:
     SCSI storage controller: Adaptec 7899P (#2) (rev 1).
       IRQ 16.
       Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=40.Max Lat=25.
       I/O at 0x5400 [0x54ff].
       Non-prefetchable 64 bit memory at 0xf7f00000 [0xf7f00fff].
This is an Ultra160 controller I believe (or at least thats what it says 
during bootup.)
Before I applied this patch it would print garbage for the 
Vendor/Rev/Type/ANSI SCSI revision of my hard disk.  With this patch it 
does not.
I unfortunately know very little about SCSI drivers, so I can't say 
exactly what causes this problem with the stock 2.4.0 adaptec driver.
