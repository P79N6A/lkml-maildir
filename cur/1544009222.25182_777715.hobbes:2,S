USB doesn't use that for PCI suspend-resume, it uses it for suspend-resume of
USB devices behind the controller.

Yeah.  Or simply use pci_prepare_to_sleep() and be done with it.

OK
But then we will save the device's registers in the "sleeping" state.  Is this
going to be entirely correct in all possible cases?  [pci_save_state() doesn't
save the PM registers, so that _should_ be correct, but I don't have _that_
much experience with these things.]
