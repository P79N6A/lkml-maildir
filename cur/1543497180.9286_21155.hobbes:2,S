   The guy you qualify as ideolog has promoted things that _really_ exist and 
   are used and useable nowadays. Could it be possible he just is a pragmatic 
   ideolog ? ;-)
You mean things like the GNU Hurd?  It wasn't all that long ago that
Stallman was putting down Linux and promoting the Hurd as the true GNU
operating system.  These days of course, he's changed his tune and is
going around demand that people call Linux "GNU/Linux".  
   So was probably Linus and perhaps you at the beginning of the Linux
   project. But time may have cleared part of your memory.
No, we wanted something which was useful.  That's the difference.  If
you look at the history of Linux, you won't find any of the original,
major developers saying, "we think intellectual property is evil
incarnate and so we're going to work hard to put all propietary software
companies out of business."  Instead, it's people wanting a useful
kernel and a useful operating system, which is a very different
emphasis.  
Linus has said that he doesn't like dictating to people which software
license they should use; this is another demonstration of how most folks
in the Linux community are not ideologues.
   You seem to speak as some representant of the whole Linux community.
   Did I miss some election you won or perhaps what you call 'Linux
   community' is very different from what I understand from.
I don't pretend to speak for the Linux community, but having been at the
Linux Expo with a *large* number of booths of hardware and software
vendors, it's pretty clear to me that the Linux community is more than
just free software fanatics.  As such, I was merely stating my opinion
that it might not be a wise chose to transfer copyright ownership of the
Linux kernel to folks who very clearly have a single, very tightly
focused agenda.   It may coincide with the beliefs of some of the folks
in the Linux community, but certainly not all of it.
