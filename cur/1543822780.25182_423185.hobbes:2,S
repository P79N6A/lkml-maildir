The standard doesn't require that a close on a socket should report 
POLLHUP. Thus this behavior may differ between UNIX implementations. If 
your software is requiring a POLLHUP to indicate the socket is closed I 
think it is being unnecessarily picky since read returning 0 universally 
indicates that the connection has been closed. Such are the compromises 
that are sometimes required to write portable software.

This may be a bug somewhere.. however, once again if you don't want read 
to block under any circumstances, set your sockets to non-blocking!
