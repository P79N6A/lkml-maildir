You mean in the kernel? %gs prefix is a lot faster than this.
Also the limit is only 20bit, not enough for a full address.
For user space it's useful though, but I don't see any immediate uses
other than cpu number and node number. For most purposes glibc TLS
(which uses %fs) is probably sufficient.
