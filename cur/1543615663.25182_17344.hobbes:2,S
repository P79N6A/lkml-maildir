Certainly not.  However, the Lindent style I'm trying to achieve is that
dictated by Linus.  However, CodingStyle doesn't give all of the details
of how code should be formatted, so I have to look at the code to see
what is actually there.

Well, that's what I was trying to do when I found out that lksr.org
(hosted by innominate.de) was not available.  It seems the -ncs
change is incorrect then (although my preference is to add it - there
doesn't seem to me to be any benefit of having the extra space).
