Petr,
It ran fine on my stock Mandrake 7.2 system - linux-2.2.17-21mdk and 
glibc-2.2-5mdk.  The program ran fine in both environments - command line 
and gdb-5.0.  Loadavg creeps up slowly as the program continues to run.  At 
thread #37000, loadavb is 3.65.  The ps command indicates 4 threads for the 
program (including gdb).
