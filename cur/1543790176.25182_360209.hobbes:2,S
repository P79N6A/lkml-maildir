this would be a bug - the jiffy tick should be processed every 1 msec, 
regardless of whether there are any ktimers pending. (in the future we 
want to use a special ktimer for the jiffy tick, but that's not 
implemented yet.)

this will be useful for tickless stuff - but right now 'no APIC timer 
irq for 5 seconds' is a 'must not happen'.
