Built on all the i386 configs here:
http://sr71.net/patches/2.6.11/2.6.11-rc1-mm1-mhp1/configs/
Booted on x440 (summit and generic), numaq, 4-way PIII.  I would imagine
that any problem would manifest as the system simply not booting.  The
most likely to fail would be systems with DISCONTIG enabled, because
that's where the greatest amount of churn happened.  The normal !
DISCONTIG case still uses most of the same code.
Anyway, I think they're probably ready for a run in -mm, with the "if
the machines don't boot check these first" flag set.  Although, I'd
appreciate any other testing that anyone wants to throw at them.
