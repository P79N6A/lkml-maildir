there are a few explicit calls to __delay() in drivers/*, so i'd assume 
so. A grep also seems to suggest so:
 ./ppc/xmon/xmon.c:extern inline void __delay(unsigned int loops)
 ./x86_64/lib/delay.c:void __delay(unsigned long loops)
 ./sparc64/lib/delay.c:void __delay(unsigned long loops)
 ./sh64/lib/udelay.c:void __delay(int loops)
 ./m32r/lib/delay.c:void __delay(unsigned long loops)
 ./i386/lib/delay.c:void __delay(unsigned long loops)
 ./s390/lib/delay.c:void __delay(unsigned long loops)
 ./sh/lib/delay.c:void __delay(unsigned long loops)
 ./powerpc/kernel/time.c:void __delay(unsigned long loops)
but yes, this is a non-specified thing so far, so there could be 
problems on some platforms. Worst-case we never time out - which could 
be detected via the NMI watchdog or the soft-lockup watchdog - so it's 
not like they would go unnoticed.
