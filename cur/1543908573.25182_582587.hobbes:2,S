This is getting dangerously close to an XML discussion.  ;)
ISTM (from reading the IETF mailing list) that the recommended tools
for generating plaintext RFCs are either
a) xml2rfc (from 
http://tools.ietf.org/inventory/author-tools
)
or
b) an MS Word plugin/macro/whatever.
There is also an xml RFC to pdf/ps converter here:
