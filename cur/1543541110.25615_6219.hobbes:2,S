Hello Linus,
you are our man.
There was discussion on DRI-Devel-List and
linux-fbdev@vuser.vu.union.edu about it, too.
All pointed to XFree86 4.0.x...
Your patch fix the X server shutdown case, at least for me with
2.4.0-test6-pre8 on a Voodoo5 5500 and DRI CVS.
Unresolved cases are:
Switch from graphics mode (vt 7) to any textmode console as the X server
goes on.
The reverse case is fine.
Thanks,
    Dieter
