Indeed, private futexes are by far the most common.

Your lockless pagecache work would solve most of that, no?

one could do something like this:
 struct address_space *mapping = page_mapping(page);
 if (!mapping || mapping == &swapper_space)
   do_private_futex();
 else
   do_shared_futex(mapping->host, page->index, addr % PAGE_SIZE);
But alas, it seems I overlooked that the mmap_sem also protects the page
tables as pointed out by Hugh, so this is all in fain it seems.
A well.
