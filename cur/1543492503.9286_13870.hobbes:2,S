No, being "tied to the UID" is most of the problem that capabilities
are designed to solve! If you tie capabilities to an admin account,
then you might as well call that account "root" and just forget about
all this screwing around.

Program capabilities could be greater (granted by an admin), as long
as the user is blocked from editing them.

Duh. Don't even worry about that. Nobody would be that stupid.

These are not currently considered capabilities. That would require
starting normal users with capabilities by default.

Yes, but an admin user may add capabilities to a user's executable.

Mostly true...
Users can "ask" root to manage an executable.
The admin could grant extended privs on a setuid-foo executable,
even beyond what user foo would normally have.
The kernel can not tell what privs a user should have. That info is
stored in a file somewhere in /etc, /rsbac, or /tcb. (the kernel does
not read your /etc/passwd or /etc/group files either)
