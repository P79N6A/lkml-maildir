It will certainly do so if _truely_ interactive tasks are using
significant cpu.

How would that help if the cause of starvation is "interactive" tasks
being requeued?  At present, EXPIRED_STARVING() will initiate an array
switch, but that only gives you one slice every nr_running seconds.  For
one non-interactive task (group A) to achieve parity with N interactive
tasks (group B) which are doing round-robin requeue, you'd need an N
second slice.

A group scheduler (array of arrays) would solve that as well as the
above.  You can kind of implement such a scheduler within the scheduler
via priority twiddling, but I don't think you can't get there from here
via timeslice modulation alone.

Yeah, I'm currently requeueing based upon latency, and it does have both
promise and some interesting rough spots.  I've eliminated the massively
painful to interactive tasks array switch when busy successfully, but
requeueing starving tasks within the active array itself still needs
work.

Good luck.
