Yes, your are right. gprs[2] holds the syscall number for the debugger to
change.
So (!entryexit & regs->gprs[2] < 0) translates to the debugger changed the
guest
system call to something illegal on the first of the two ptrace calls. So
the
patch doesn't hurt for normal, non-ptraced operation but it might hurt
other
users of ptrace.

Ok, I think I've understood the problem now. What you are basically have is
a process running in a UML guest that happens to have -ERESTARTXXX in grp2
when it gets interrupted. A signal is delivered and on return from that
signal
with sys_(rt_)sigreturn >another< signal might be pending and then
do_signal
gets confused because of -ERESTARTXXX in grp2. For normal, non-uml
operation
restore_sigregs resets regs->trap to -1 which avoids the confusion. With
UML
the host intercepts sys_rt_sigreturn and does whatever needs to be done for
the guest >except< resetting regs->trap to -1. So the problem seems to be
that you need a ptrace interface to do that. I don't think it is a good
idea
to kludge syscall_trace to reset regs->trap under some conditions.
