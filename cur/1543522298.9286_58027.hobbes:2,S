Here are some results from Bonnie on dual WD 10G UDMA/66 drives, separate
HPT366 controllers on an ABIT BP6 dual Celeron-433 motherboard running
Linux kernel 2.2.14 + ide.2.2.14.20000108.patch + raid0145-19990824-2.2.11

The first line is a single drive to establish a baseline.  The second line
is running two drives striped with 8k chunks, which shows the expected
performance improvement.  However when running the two drives mirrored
there is a significant performance degradation - not just on writes, which
is expected, but also on reads which should still be faster, not slower!
Any ideas?  (l-k readers, please copy replies to my email address)
