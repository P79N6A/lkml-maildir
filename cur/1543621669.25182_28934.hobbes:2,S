  If you are willing to code in assembler instead of C you can do better,
at least on x86. You just need to do a 32 bit increment on the LS word,
and if you get a carry you can incr the MS word.

  I doubt it, the problem is that the software which expects jiffies is
not all going to work well 64 bit. I think that's more the issue, and why
Alan et al are fixing it piecemeal, I don't think there's some magic fix
they're missing.

Absolutely. But not as often ;-)
