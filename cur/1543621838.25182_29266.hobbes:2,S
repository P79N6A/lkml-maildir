I ran into the same problem with the natsemi driver in 2.2.x (and
rtl8139 as well). I gave up trying to fix the 2.2 drivers and instead
ended up backporting the 2.4.x drivers to 2.2.x which seems to behave
much better.
You can find the backported drivers at
http://www.wildopensource.com/proj/download/SG_drivers.html
 if you
find they may be useful to you.
Cheers,
Jes
