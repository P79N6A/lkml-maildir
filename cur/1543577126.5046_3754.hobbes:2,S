    This oops occurred just a few minutes ago under no particular load.
There were actually two oopsen, but I've included only the first as I've
heard that successive oops really aren't helpful.  Nonetheless, if
anyone's interested in seeing it, I have it captured.
    These oops were processed by syslog, if that's a problem.  Not sure
if its repeatable.  This is these are the first and only oops I've had
with -prerelease, otherwise it has been very stable.
    The system is 500MHz K6/2, 64MB RAM.
