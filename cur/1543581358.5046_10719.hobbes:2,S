 The delivery status bit gets only set if an interrupt got accepted (that
implies it was unmasked at the moment) but its delivery is held pending
due to some reason.  It may happen when the target CPU has its interrupts
masked or the target local APIC cannot accept it due to a higher task
priority or no free slots.  The semantics of the bit is the same for both
local and I/O APIC interrupts.
