I have a xircom cardbus card, that is not working unless i put it in
promisc mode.. i got a patch to fix it but it seems its already in
there... i did notice however, that using the same kernelconfig as my
2.4.4 kernel that cb_enabler.o is not being installed.  A BROKEN symlink
exists in /lib/modules/2.4.5/pcmcia/cb_enabler.o ->
../kernel/drivers/pcmcia/cb_enabler.o  Anyone know why its not being
installed?  (Its under a RH 7.1 box.. the 2.4.4 kernel was fine.)
thanks!
