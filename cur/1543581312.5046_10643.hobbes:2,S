Personally I find it puzzling what's wrong with MX -> CNAME at all; it
seems like a useful setup without the pitfalls that either NS -> CNAME
or CNAME -> CNAME can cause (NS -> CNAME can trivially result in
irreducible situations; CNAME -> CNAME would require a link maximum
count which could result in obscure breakage.)
