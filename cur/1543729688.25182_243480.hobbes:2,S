Richard,
Here you go....
#define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 0x10000
                                                                                
                                                                                
NOTE:  This code barfs in kmalloc while allocating 64KB blocks.  I
allocate a large number of these blocks from this routine.  2.6.4,2.6.7,
and 2.6.8 all crash in kmem_cache_alloc when kmalloc gets called and
I have exceeded the 1GB memory space in the kernel.  I am using 2.4.20
kernels with the userspace/kernelspace patch that allows the
kernel page space to be increased from 1GB to 3GB to allow me
to allocate 2.5 GB of memory in the kernel.  I am not using
this patch at present, but was testing 2.6.8 to see if it returned
proper failure states when large amounts of memory were allocated
and kernel memory was exhausted.
                                                                                
Jeff
   for (i = 0; i < (32 * 2048); i++)
    {
       buffer = kmalloc(MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);
       if (!buffer)
       {
          P_Print("could not allocate data buffer (%d bytes)\n",
                  MAX_BUFFER_SIZE);
          break;
       }
       P_Set(buffer, 0, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE);
    }
                                                                                
Pretty easy to make it fail.
