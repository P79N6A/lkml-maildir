Would anyone actually do that? About the time of the first patch usually 
do something like:
   cd linux-2.6.11
   cp -rl . ../linux-2.6.11.1
   cd $_
   bzcat ../Patches/patch-2.6.11.1.bz2 | patch -p1
   make oldconfig
By doing copy with links for all unchanged files you use virtually no 
extra space for each revision, and that encourages creating a separate 
tree for testing patches from -ck, or -ac, or Nick.
I use it to compile with various options as well, I usually build test 
versions for P-II, P-III, P4-HT and Athlon depending on what I'm testing.
