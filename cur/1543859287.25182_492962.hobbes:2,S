Oh well maybe I suck at writing exact definitions in one-phrase phrases.
Anyway, what was intended:
(1) Catch casts where they are usually not necessary, because the value
    would be anyhow discarded
    (void)strcpy(b, a);
    (Does not apply to e.g. cmpxchg -- that's why I mentioned (b)!)
(2) Catch casts which do not change the type of an expression, e.g.
    void *x = (void *)kmalloc(...)
(3) Catch casts which do not change the outcome, because from-to-void* is
    warningless
    struct foo *bar = (struct foo *)kmalloc(...)
    Quite often seen in kernel code.
(4) extension and truncation, implicit conversions - unneessary casts
    func_taking_u32( (u32)some_u16 );
    func_taking_u16( (u16)some_u32 );
(5) Slightly harder one: Where the evaluation process changes, but the
    outcome is the same
    #define V_FL_BASE_HI(x)  ((x) << 8)
    #define V_FL_INDEX_LO(x) (x)
    #define M_FL_INDEX_LO    0xFF
    static void t3_write_reg(struct adapter *, u32, u32);
    int t3_sge_init_flcntxt(struct adapter *adapter, unsigned int id,
                        int gts_enable, u64 base_addr, unsigned int size,
                        unsigned int bsize, unsigned int cong_thres, int gen,
                        unsigned int cidx)
    {
        t3_write_reg(adapter, A_SG_CONTEXT_DATA1,
                     V_FL_BASE_HI((u32) base_addr) |
                     V_FL_INDEX_LO(cidx & M_FL_INDEX_LO));
    }
    (Note that this is not exactly code found in the cxgb3 driver, but
    tweaked for this example)
    As far as I can see, even if base_addr was not truncated to u32, the end
    result would be, when the u64 value is passed to t3_write_reg.

__attribute__((used)) would be more appropriate, I think.
