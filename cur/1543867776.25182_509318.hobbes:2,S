I disagree.  Linux needs popularity at the moment.
Otherwise, Linux may be in for a hard time once manufacturers standardize on TPM-enabled 
processors that only allow 'authorized' code to run.  And it looks like this is going to 
happen.
Unless there is a sufficient user base (ie a market) for Linux, what incentive are Intel, 
AMD, etc going to have to make their hardware run anything except code signed by Microsoft?
When taken off modern CPUs, Linux will be relegated to hobby cpu fabs, legacy hardware and 
maybe a niche back in the embedded market.  Then watch development all but stagnate. 
Something I'd rather not see happen.
