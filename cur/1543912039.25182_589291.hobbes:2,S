Only NICs interrupts are suposed to be stopped, system will continue to
work as usual, since all others are alive.
Having hrtimer to reshcedule NIC procesing can work only if number of
timer's interrupts are much less than NICs and if rate of the timer's
starts/changes (presumbly in NICs interrupt) is small too, otherwise
having too many NIC interrupts will not gain anything (actually it is
what is supposed to be dropped noticebly).
