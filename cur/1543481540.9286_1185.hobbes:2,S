Indeed. My experience is that mechanisms which attempt to "describe" stuff
falls prey to complexity (and tend to invoke the halting problem if you
take them too far). An nioctl call with a length would be several orders
of magnitude less complex. (Quite literally.)

Which amounts to the same thing, save that in the kernel you can query for
end-of-target-memory in a somewhat efficient manner.

Mainly: how to implement UNIX style syscalls without memory protection. 
uClinux currently doesn't have any mechanism for efficiently finding what
memory a user process owns (this is partially a simple implementation
issue, and partially the lack of an MMU). 
Actually, I'm interested in the entire aspect of checkpointing, ptrace,
etc., for uClinux and in general. uClinux adds a few interesting twists,
among them: binaries are executed directly from ROM whenever possible, and
ptrace needs some additional concepts to indicate the base address space
of a process. The first means ld.so style fixups are not an option, and
the second means any debugger will need a bit of tweaking. (On that note,
I wanted to set gdb up for this, but was sorely disappointed at the
quality of its ptrace-based remote server.)
