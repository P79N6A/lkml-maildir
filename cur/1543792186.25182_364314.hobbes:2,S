While this is at least no worse in the nested fault case than earlier 
kernels, I really wish I had one of those weird 486s so I could test the 
faulting mechanism.  It seems the trap handling code has gotten quite 
complicated now, with notifiers adding nice functionality, but making 
the ordering of potential fault paths difficult to reason about (in 
particular when considering functionality like kexec, kprobes, NMIs and 
friends).

So some 486 processors do have CR4 register.  Allow them to present it in
register dumps by using the old fault technique rather than testing processor
family.
Thanks to Maciej for noticing this.
