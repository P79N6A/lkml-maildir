Agreed. I'll get something like this done for the next release.

Hmm. In my code, I move the interval delta (similar to your pre-scale
offset) to system_time (seems to be equivalent to the post-scale) at
each call to timeofday_interrupt_hook(). So while 64 bits are normally
used, you could probably get away doing the interval delta calculations
in 32bits if your timesource frequency isn't too large. This would only
be done in the arch-specific 32bit vsyscall code, right?

Great, thats what I was hoping.
