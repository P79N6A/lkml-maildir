 nope.
 not in the slightest bit: i wish it did!!!
 i'm using 2.6.8 [.1-selinux1 from 
http://sf.net/projects/selinux
]

 please tell me how i enable such functionality!
 i remove a usb media, HAL does a umount -lf, konqueror still has
 directory handles open (see report i sent earlier with the little
 program opendir.c which duplicates what konqueror does), then HAL
 does an ioctl("/dev/sdc1", Block_Re_Read_PARTition) which returns 
 an error message "Device or Resource Busy".
 david (hal developer) considers this to be a serious bug in the
 linux kernel because a user action can cause hotplug events to
 not be generated.
 the above ioctl is supposed to cause a hotplug event that will
 allow HAL to remove the volume from its records.
 and it can't.

around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
