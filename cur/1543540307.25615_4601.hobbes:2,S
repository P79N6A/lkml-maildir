So you just try your exploit n times, in order of decreasing popularity.
Or you just scan a large net, trying Redhat exploit on all of them and be
content to own only the machines running Redhat. Or.. (etc.)

That's fine for a proprietary program, but not for one that's distributed
for free in source and binary forms. The attack model we have to assume is
that the attacker knows everything about your system configuration except
for passwords.

We're not talking about single holes. We have n exploitable buffer
overruns. The non-exec patch will leave us with n exploitable buffer
overruns next week and a false sense of security. Meanwhile the patch
is disgusting complex - it's like putting four deadbolts on your front
door while leaving your back door open..

But the exploit would still be there. Progressively crippling the system
in a vain attempt to cover up holes in poorly-written applications is not
the way to go.
Look, _auditing is a must for security_. Even languages that do
bounds-checking and taint checking or work in a sandbox are not
automatically safe. There are many other security flaws besides buffer
overflows with new classes of them being discovered regularly. There is no
substitute for regular audits.
