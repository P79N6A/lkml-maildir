Hi,
Me again with some NFS problems.
I have setup a Linux box running 2.2.1-ac3 with knfsd-981204.
The NFS client is a Solaris 2.5.1 writing on the Linux NFS serveur.
It writes a 1,8 Gb file, rereads it, then unlinks it and exits (iozone
test program).
Once the file has been unlinked, I verify that it has disappeared on
both ends (serveur and client). But a 'df' indicates that the space
is still used (ie, there is still 1,8 Gb used on the serveur partition).
If I umount the NFS partition on the Solaris client, there is no
change ('df' gives me the same result). When a remount the NFS partition
on the Solaris client, the space is freed on the serveur side.
The fact is that if I do not umount the NFS partition, I run out
of space as soon as I run the iozone test program again.
Has anyone already seen that ?
Thanks,
