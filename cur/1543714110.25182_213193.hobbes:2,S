Building the (binary) nvidia driver I got this warning:
In file included from /lib/modules/2.4.26-rc2/build/include/linux/vmalloc.h:8,
                  from nv-linux.h:62,
                  from os-interface.c:26:
/lib/modules/2.4.26-rc2/build/include/linux/highmem.h: In function `bh_kmap':
/lib/modules/2.4.26-rc2/build/include/linux/highmem.h:20: warning: pointer of type `void *' used in arithmetic
Looking there I see:
static inline char *bh_kmap(struct buffer_head *bh)
{
         return kmap(bh->b_page) + bh_offset(bh);
}
And in /usr/include/linux/highmem.h I see:
static inline void *kmap(struct page *page) { return page_address(page); }
So we really are doing 'void *' math, which is not right. Maybe a cast is
called for in bh_kmap(), like:
	return (char *)kmap(bh->b_page) + bh_offset(bh);
