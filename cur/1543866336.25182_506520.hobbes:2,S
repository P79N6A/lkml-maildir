If physical devices are registered before class devices then when
suspending class devices are naturally suspended first. It is still
not clear to me why we need to convert everythign to struct device, I
believe I've shown (with patches) that it is possible to integrate
struct class_device into PM framework and avoid reshuffling half of
the kernel code.
