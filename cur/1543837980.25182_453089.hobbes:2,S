FWIW I saw FC4 do the same thing with the first 2.6.17 kernel. Didn't 
have time to investigate, so didn't report, just a suggestion that it 
may be something which happened earlier. I was going to look for a more 
recent version of the firmware, but the 2.6.16 is working fine, so I put 
it on hold, for a cold winter day.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
