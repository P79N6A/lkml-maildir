ps is reading System.map probably because reading /proc/<pid>/wchan 
directly was very slow. It used to take an average of 1.3ms (on a P4 
2.8GHz) and now it takes less than 0.5us (that is miliseconds and 
microseconds!)
If this is the case, then after the changes to kallsyms go in, procps 
could start using wchan directly and avoid reading the System.map 
altogether.
I'm adding Albert Cahalan to this list since he should know a little 
more about this :)
