Hi Norman,
I just tested make menuconfig/xconfig/gconfig and got the same results
from all 3 of them.
| In the .config generated by make xconfig, the following lines exist:
| 
| #
| # USB Human Interface Devices (HID)
| #
| CONFIG_USB_HID=m
| CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
| # CONFIG_HID_FF is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV is not set
| 
| #
| # USB HID Boot Protocol drivers
| #
| # CONFIG_USB_KBD is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_MOUSE is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_AIPTEK is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_WACOM is not set
| [...]
USB_KBD and USB_MOUSE show up here (above) because USB_HID=m.
Somehow it got changed to USB_HID=y in the config file below,
and that changes the rules for some of the items under it.

| CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV=y

| # CONFIG_USB_WACOM is not set
| [...]

I think that Roman Zippel already replied to this, but you won't
find USB_KBD there because USB_HID=y and they are mutually
exclusive.
In summary, I checked again and still don't see a problem.
