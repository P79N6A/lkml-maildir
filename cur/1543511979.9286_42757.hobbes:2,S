Hi,
  I have a bunch of Gateway ALR 8200 hundred servers.  They have bult in
Intel EtherExpress Pro100 network cards.  Since I have upgraded to 2.3.18
kernels I am getting alot of 'Transmit timed out:' messages.  All of the
servers are pluged into a cisco 2924 switches.  This problem is
reproducable very easily especialy if you do ping -f on both receiving and
sending side of the link. I have tried repacing the switches and can
reproduce the problem both on a Bay Networks and Cisco 1900 switches. Also
I tried changing network cards and this hapens only on a builtin
EEPRO100, both Netgear and EEPRO100-PCI are working great.
thanks fil
P.S.
I Looked into the EEPro100 Mailing List archive and saw quite a few people
with the same or similar problem, but wasn't sure about the outcome or the
solution? Any suggestions?
