I didn't find any of these problems on our machine. The *only*
problem is that the machine can't make network connections to
another Linux 2.2.1 Alpha or to any Irix box. If we didn't have
these other boxen around we'd never have noticed anything. 
Telnet, NFS, NIS, etc are working fine from all other machines.
X is running all the time, mostly with KDE and lots of terminals.
2 cpu-intensive jobs are running.
Maybe later kernels introduced additional problems?
