Yes. In fact, I got two warnings, another one is in drivers/lguest/hypercalls.c.
If I understand you correctly, you mean we can do nothing useful to fix it?

I have sent a mail which described the errors I got when comipling Documentation/lguest/lguest.c. But it seems that you didn't receive it (it didn't appear in lkml.org neither!). It is that, I have already made my .config as you suggested, but I still can't compile Documentation/lguest/lguest.c, errors are:
lguest.c: In function 'add_to_bridge':
lguest.c:779: error: 'SIOCBRADDIF' undeclared (first use in this function)
lguest.c:779: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
lguest.c:779: error: for each function it appears in.)
Can you help me out?
Thanks!
