Ok, I'm definitely not going to apply it right now, though.

Exactly.
The only way to handle that case is to make sure that the person who 
*gets* the spinlock will slow down. The person who doesn't get it can't do 
anything at all about the fact that he's locked out.
A way to do that (as already mentioned) is to have a "this lock is 
contended" flag, and have the person who gets the lock do something about 
it (where the "something" might actually be as simple as saying "When I 
release a lock that somebody marked as having lots of contention, I will 
clear the contention flag, and then just delay myself").
Side note: that trivial approach only really helps for a *single* thread 
that gets it very much (like the example in wait_task_inactive). For true 
contention with multiple different CPU's that can *all* have the bad 
behaviour, you do actually need real queueing.
