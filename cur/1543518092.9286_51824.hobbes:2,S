I use mulipath routing for that.
Install ip program from Alexey Kuznetsov
iproute-2.2.4-2 package (on RedHat 6.1)
then
entablish all your ppp links WITHOUT default route set in ppp configuration.
then
/sbin/ip route add default nexthop via gateway.number.1.ip dev ppp0 nexthop via gateway.number.2.ip dev ppp1 nexthop via gateway.number.2.ip dev ppp2
all these things I handle by scripts in
/etc/ppp/ip-up.local /etc/ppp/ip-down.local
when you do
/sbin/ip route list
you will see default routing as multipath routing:
default
        nexthop via 10.65.60.12  dev ppp1 weight 1
        nexthop via 10.65.60.12  dev ppp0 weight 1
It works, but it is not perfect.
Some times it does not do good balancing.
