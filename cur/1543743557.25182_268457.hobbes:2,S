Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This code has not been ratified on the LSM list, there are still several
open issues, including opposition to the idea of arbitrary stacking of
security modules by myself.
I don't think that the kernel should provide such a service.
This is the initial LSM thread:
http://mail.wirex.com/pipermail/linux-security-module/2004-October/5567.html
Here are posts where I explain my objections:

Please don't apply.
