Please acknowledge that you understand how inappropriate
and problem causing your huge patch bomb was today to this
mailing list.
It is nearly 8 hours later, and vger.kernel.org is still
trying mightily to spit out all of your patches to the
5000+ people subscribed to linux-kernel.
There is about ~6 hour posting latency as a result of all
of this.
