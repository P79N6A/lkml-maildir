Serial console perhaps?  There is documentation on how to do that in the
Documentation/ directory.

Ugh, I really wish I knew which ddevice acpi was trying to add here.  It
looks like it is addding 2 pci busses with the same address, which would
be very odd.  How about creating a bug in bugzilla.kernel.org and
assigning it to the ACPI group?  They should be able to figure it out :)
thanks,
