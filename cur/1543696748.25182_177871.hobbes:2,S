My Toshiba P25-S507 P4 2.8 running vanilla 2.6.0-test9 occasionally
freezes.  The freezes occur during events such as closing or opening
the lid or removing/inserting the power adapter and sometimes during
halt.
The freezes are reasonably rare. Occuring perhaps once every 3
days or so.
On the other hand, I have not been able to force one.  Purposely playing
with the power or the lid switch I have not been able to cause the
freeze.  However, everytime it happens it has been associated with one
of the actions listed above.
I believe the freezes do happen with earlier 2.6.0-test kernels,
but they seemed more rare then.  
I don't recall a freeze ever occuring with 2.4.20-gentoo-r5.
