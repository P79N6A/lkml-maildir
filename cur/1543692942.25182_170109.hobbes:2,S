Hello,
I'm using a logitech scroll mouse (USB) and I just upgraded
to kernel 2.6-test6 (which works flawlessly on my AMD system
btw). But I seem to have lost the scroll capability of my mouse...
Is this already a known issues? Or am I forgetting something trivial?
I could not find usefull information on the Internet.
Please CC me on any follow-ups, as i'm only reading the linux kernel digest,
thank,
    grtz  Miek
