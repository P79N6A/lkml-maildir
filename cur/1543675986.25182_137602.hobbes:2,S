Subject: [PATCHSET] prerelease of 2.4.21-rc6-dis3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a new pre-release of 2.4.21-rc6-dis3 for laptops (specifically
Inspiron 8500, but its a lot more general these days) on my site. 
http://www.gotontheinter.net/kernel/
 has all the details, but the
biggest change is that non-8500 users don't have to patch it before use
(yay) and there are a couple of patches that should make nvidia users
happier.
Basically anyone with ACPI-only systems can take advantage of at least
some of this (eg swsusp) and laptop users should -really- like it.
Testers very welcome, especially those of you with nvidia cards..
In addition to the rest of the community, big kudos go to Con for his
-ck set (from which some of these patches originated) and both Graeme
and Mike for their work on the i8500.  I think that with -dis3 (and a
solid AML debug pass, since the DSDT it ships is junk) we'll have this
thing beat yet :)
