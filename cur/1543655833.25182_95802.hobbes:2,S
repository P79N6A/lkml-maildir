The module changes basically left me unable to do any further 2.5.5x
work at an acceptable rate. My time is now allocated to other projects
until January. At that point hopefully the module stuff will be usable
again, parameters will work etc and I can go back to work on 2.5.
Rusty is right that the ide stuff has dependancy loops right now. His
new module stuff shouldn't have crashed but the fundamental work to be
done is in the IDE layer. There are also some locking problems to
address before modular IDE becomes useful.
