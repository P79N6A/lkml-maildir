  Hmm, the code is quite "inventive" in the way it uses struct
buffer_head - does anybody know if we have this documented anywhere BTW?
  In b_size it keeps the size of area it would like to map, filesystem
on the other hand returns in it how much it managed to map from the
required area. This number is in bytes, thus it has to be divided by the
size of the block ( >>blkbits is just a more effective way to code
division). Variable first_logical_block keeps offset (in blocks) at
which the last call to get_block() happened.
