What happens if I have a device that can be either ISA or connected 
directly to a local memory bus? The driver should be able to 
ioremap(some resource) and then read/write the device without
having to have ugly #ifdefs to deal with different bus types.
Example in point is the CS8900a device which is hooked up directly
to a FPGA on the local memory bus with the bytelanes backwards.
The ammount of hacking done in the driver to get around that is
ugly. It would be much nicer if the driver still just did read*/write*
and the platform level code could deal with all the translation
issues. This requires a generic API for all I/O devices.
