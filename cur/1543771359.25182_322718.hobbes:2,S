Although it's unclear by the kernel output, this is a reiserfs panic due
to an i/o error in the journal, not a BUG. Kernels prior to 2.6.10,
unless specifically patched, could not handle i/o errors in the journal.
This functionality has not been backported to 2.4 kernels.
I suspect that perhaps klogd was matched against the wrong kernel symbol
table, and that's why you're seeing odd output in your syslog. The
entire call chain, after sync_supers, should be in reiserfs if you're
getting that panic.
