Hi
Can anyone there help me
I am able to compile and download the kernel (2.4.19) on to my Assabet board
, same thing when i am trying to compile 2.6 test10 with .rmk10 patch i am
not able to make it up at the same board.
What are the differences made in 2.6 when compared to 2.4
I tried modifying the foll. values in different files based on my
requirement.
1. include/asm-arm/arch-sa1100/memory.h
TEXT_SIZE 0xC8000000UL
PHYS_OFFSET 0xC8000000UL
PAGE_OFFSET 0xC8000000UL
2. arch/arm/Makefile
 ifeq((CONFIG_ARCH_CPU32),y)
  MACHINE = sa1100
 endif
The above value is available in 2.4.19, but in 2.6 i am not able identify
it.
In arch/arm/mach-sa1100/arch.c
 a) In fixup_assabet
i  Changed
  i)t->u.mem.start = 0xC8000000 from 0xC0000000
  ii)t->u.mem.size = 16*1024*1024 from 32*1024*1024
  iii)t->u.initrd.start = 0xC8300000 from 0xC0800000
