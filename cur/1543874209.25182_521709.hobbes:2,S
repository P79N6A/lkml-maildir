Yes, it can span multiple MTDs which spreads the wear-leveling even
more.  Yes, it can create/resize/remove volumes.  It does that
differently than LVM, but the ideas are related.  I don't see the issue
here I guess.
(UBI also has static volumes which LVM doesn't but that is an aside.)

Ok, but what I'm saying is that using device mapper on top of mtdblock
is not a good solution.  mtdblock caches writes within an eraseblock to
a DRAM buffer of eraseblock size.  If you get a power failure before
that is flushed out, you lose an entire eraseblock's worth of data.
Oops.  And if you constantly flush the buffer, there's no point in
having it in the first place because it doesn't help or hide anything
then.  UBI doesn't have this problem.
That's why I suggested fixing the MTD layers that present block devices
first in the part of my reply that you cut off.  It seems to me that
you're really after getting flash to look like a block device, which
would enable device mapper to be used for something similar to UBI.
That's fine, but until someone does that work UBI fills a need, has
users, and has an existing implementation.
