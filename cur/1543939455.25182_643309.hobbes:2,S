Good.  Then this case gets easy.
We just need a pgd that has pgd entries that duplicate the kernel pgd entries
at both address 0 and at the normal kernel address.
In 64bit mode we make this part of the trampoline because we need a pgt below
4G so that we can point a 32bit %cr3 value at it.  We can either use that
technique for the 32bit kernel (and be consistent) or we can have a single
trampoline/wakeup pgd that we use.  As all pgd entries must be below 4G in
32bit mode.
Although if we really wanted to be restrictive we could have a much more limited
set of identity page table entries that only map the low 1M, or possibly just
640K.
