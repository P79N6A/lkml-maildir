Al,
  Is there somewhere one could see what you are planning to merge?  
I was following the klibc dicussion list, but the archiver went slient after
August.
I like the idea in general, but I wasn't sure where this was going.   It
looked like the discussion there was going for replacing the do_mounts with
the kernel uncpio/uncompress followed by a bunch of small utilities and
scripts.  I had some other ideas that I played with, but depend on starting
with a single binary to make a lot of sense (going for the multi-call binary
base approach).   (This would leave the initrd file for the user space).
If there is some place to get a preview I would appreciate it.
Thanks,
milton
