BTW.  The above attitude was fostered by informing the Changes
maintainer that the recommended NFS userspace server was on the
exploits list (back in the 2.0 kernel days when knfs was new) and
getting a "I don't use that, so what" response.
...and the documentation continued to recommend an exploitable NFS
server... in short: you must cross-check to be sure, at least in linux
you have a few more options.
