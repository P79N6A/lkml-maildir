I'm planning on getting x86emu support into vbetool in the near future,
mostly because AMD64 doesn't have vm86 support. It's worth noting that
attempting to re-POST many (most?) laptops will fail miserably - the
code simply isn't available after boot. Saving/restoring state with VBE
code tends to be more reliable, but there are some machines that need
POSTing.
In the long run, it's the sort of thing that needs a hardware database,
which effectively requires it to be in userspace.
