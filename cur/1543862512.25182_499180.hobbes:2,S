Still can't understand you. Probably you missed what singlethread_cpu is.
singlethread_cpu is just a "random" bit from cpu_possible_map. Single
threaded workqueue is not bound to any cpu. We only need it to be sure that
percpu_data.ptrs[singlethread_cpu] is populated by __percpu_alloc_mask().

As I said already __create_workqueue() needs a fix, schedule_on_each_cpu()
is already broken, and should be fixed as well.

Srivatsa, why do you think this would be better?
It add to the complexity! What do you mean by "stopping that thread" ?
Kill it? - this is wrong. Make it TASK_STOPPED? - very untrivial and I
can't see how this helps.
Oleg.
