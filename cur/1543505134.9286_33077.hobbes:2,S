Hello!

Yup. And to add code to calculate MSS from estimated path mtu,
taking into account IPsec overhead.

Alan, the world is not such happy place 8). IPv6 has no DF flag,
so that path mtu discovery is not an option.

Path MTU discovery is run to IMPROVE things. If we do not use
path MTU discovery we must use mtu of 576. The period.
The only security problem of pmtu discovery is when someone
blocks icmp. Well, it is curable. And if without IPsec we may
blame on stupid network admins, blocking them, with IPsec we will
have to work it around.
