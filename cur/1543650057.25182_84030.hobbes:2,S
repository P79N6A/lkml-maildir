Let me get the gist of the idea.
To accelerate UML, and wine type applications:
1) setup segments with restricted limits, so their children cannot
   write into their supervisor process even though they share a mm.
2) load a special system call table that switches processor modes
   when any system call is activated.
Unless I am mistaken all of the above can be accomplished without
using the cpus multiple rings of privilege.  Which would allow nesting
only limited by the address space reduction of each task.
