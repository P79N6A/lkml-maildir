Hi!
Is the ext2 filesystem of 2.2.12 (hadn't had time to upgrade) known to cause
problems? My root file system developed some errors (all of them in
/usr/bin). fsck took care of most of them, but one remains. I can't really
understand this one:
<root> /usr/bin# ls -l pwgen
s---rwxr-x  21 21       49214       65548 Jan  2  1970 pwgen=
<root> /usr/bin# lsattr pwgen
lsattr: Innapropriate "ioctl" för device While reading flags on pwgen
<root> /usr/bin# rm pwgen
rm: cannot unlink "pwgen": Operation not permitted
Trying to run fsck on this ends with:
Ferrari: 63626/257000 files (5.0% non-contiguous), 772771/1024001 blocks
Segmentation fault
(don't know if this is a Debian bug, though).
This is an excerpt from my syslog:
