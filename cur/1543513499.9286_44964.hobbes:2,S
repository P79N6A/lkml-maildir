So are you saying that the empty value is the same as "y" in this
case? Certainly to my way of thinking, that's the wrong way round for
this particular variable - the whole idea of CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is
surely that one has to positively state that one is interested in
experimental values before one gets offered them?
Remember, CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL = "m" is meaningless, so the normal
argument based on that being a possible value is also meaningless.
Best wishes from Riley.

    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
