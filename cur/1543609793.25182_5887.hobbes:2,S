Hey,
I've been running 2.4.14 for a few days now.  I needed LFS support, so I
recompiled glibc 2.1.3 with the new 2.4 headers, and after that I could
create large files (e.g. using dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1M count=0
seek=3000) just fine.
However, as of yesterday, I couldn't create files bigger than 2GB anymore.
I did not change kernels, nor did I mess with libc or anything else (I did
some Debian package upgrades/installations/recompiles, but I don't think
they should affect this) - I'm not quite sure what happened.  Now commands
such as the dd command I mentioned above will die with the message "File
size limit exceeded", leaving a 2GB file behind.  Rebooting didn't solve
anything.  My ulimits seem to be fine (file size = unlimited).
The last few lines of the strace on the dd command above shows the
following:
open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY|0x8000)      = 0
close(1)                                = 0
open("test", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|0x8000, 0666) = 1
ftruncate64(0x1, 0xbb800000, 0, 0, 0x1) = 0
--- SIGXFSZ (File size limit exceeded) ---
+++ killed by SIGXFSZ +++
Also, cat'ing two 2GB files together into one big 4GB file (cat file1 file2
> file3) just dies after creating a 2GB file, whereas it used to work fine
(if I remember correctly).  Doing an strace on it ends with the following
lines:
write(1, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 4096)
= 4096
read(3, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 4096) =
4096
write(1, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 4096)
= 4095
write(1, "\0", 1)                       = -1 EFBIG (File too large)
--- SIGXFSZ (File size limit exceeded) ---
+++ killed by SIGXFSZ +++
I'm doing this on a ReiserFS filesystem, but trying it on an ext2 partition
yields the same results.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Alex
