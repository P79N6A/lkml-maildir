This isn't quite the same scenario, but it's similar - using an MPI
ping-pong test between two machines, I get latencies of ~140
microseconds UP kernels and ~180 microseconds with SMP kernels. I
can't remember the bandwidth figures, but they were also higher with a
UP kernel unless the amount of data being transferred was very large.
