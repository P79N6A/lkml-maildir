Please CC me if you reply to the list as I am not on the list.
Andy Grover, ACPI Maintainer, I am CCing you directly as I think this is your 
bug at this point. When I compile a kernel without ACPI, the bug does not 
show its face. When I compile with ACPI in modules and load none of the 
modules, the bug still happens. I think that the bug exists in the base ACPI 
support code as a result. The bug is described below. I have not tried the 
latest linus bk patches. This current round of tests was performed on 2.5.66. 
2.5.63 is the last version of the kernel that does not have this bug.
Thanks, Warren
