Hi,
It took me about an hour to find out why my keyboard didn't work in 2.5.45. 
Well... after all it seemed that I need to enable 4 ! options inside the 
input configuration, just to get my default, nothing special PS/2 keyboard up 
and running. Oh, and I didn't even have my not so fancy boring default PS/2 
mouse configured then. Guys, being able to configure everything is nice, but 
with the 2.5 kernel, things are definitely getting out of control IMHO.
