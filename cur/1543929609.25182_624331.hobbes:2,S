We've talked this one before on netdev.  It's on my todo list to fix.
The correct solution is to untangle this so that __dev_set_promiscuity
does not get called in the first place on BH paths.
Unfortunately I've been busy so I haven't completed the patches yet.
But as this problem is not urgent let's not just put on a bandaid.
Thanks,
