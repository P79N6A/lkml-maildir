More reason why you should not be moving stuff all around the tree...
Really, file structure is one of the LEAST important issues around -- 
while moving files around introduces a non-zero amount of pain.
New files -- like that godawful and nearly empty samples/ directory -- 
sure, fix that up before release.  But let's not break diffs of existing 
architectures without good reason.
