Subject: [BK PATCH] One more USB update for 2.4.22-pre5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Right after I send out the last USB updates, I got this one from the
usb-storage people.  It seems pretty serious, so I'm sending this one
out as a single patch.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/marcelo-2.4
The individual patch will be sent in a follow up message to this email
to you and the linux-usb-devel mailing list.
thanks,
greg k-h

  [PATCH] USB: usb-storage US_FL_FIX_CAPACITY fix
  
  Pat LaVarre uncovered a bug where you could throw a well-formed (but
  arguably meaningless) INQUIRY command at a device via the sg interface
  and OOPS the usb-storage driver.  This prevents that from happening.
  
  This has been in 2.5 for a while now.  A 2.4 backport is probably a good
  thing.
