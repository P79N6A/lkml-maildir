This patch set includes two patches against linux-2.6.21-rc1:
- dynamic add / remove port:
  Interface has been discussed and approved by John Rose
  (see: 
http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg25327.html
)
- NAPI multi queue TX/RX path for SMP:
  Integrated comments from mailing list (R. Dreier)
  As soon as discussions about "splitting NAPI from netdevice"
  have settled and this functionality is in kernel, we'll provide
  a patch for the new interface.
  (see: 
http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg25647.html
)
please apply.
