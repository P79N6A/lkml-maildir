I must to point You to the fact that releasing all tasks as was done 
previously is the same issue I do without the extra cost of wakeups 
and schedules.
I think that the goodness implementation solves the mm and smp precendences 
as long as the way to exit for every task queued.
This is my opinion, if I'm crazy let me know.
Cheers,
	Davide.
