Hi Scott
The device tree already has a brg-frequency  property in qe node which
is the value of BRGCLK. The function get_brg_clk uses this property to
find the value of BRGCLK.
In case this value is 0(some older u-boots populate bus-frequency
property of qe and not the brg-frequency), get_brg_clk  uses
bus-frequency/2 as BRGCLK.
With Regards
Poonam

Should also have a clock-frequency property to specify what BRGCLK is.
