(your mail client is replacing tabs with spaces)
I think this is actually a bugfix.  The code you're removing doesn't do the 
	if (priority < zone->prev_priority)
thing.
otoh with this change, the only thing which will cause prev_priority to
increase (ie: lower priority) is kswapd, which seems odd.
So:
a) this is a functional change and needs more thought and lots of runtime
   testing.  I'll duck it for now.
b) the prev_priority stuff is still screwed up.
