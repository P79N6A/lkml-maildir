Yes, that would work. However, I don't feel comfortable with setting
fops->owner to anything else than THIS_MODULE. In particular, this
causes problems when multiple watchdog drivers register with the
watchdog base module.
The sequence I had in mind was:
chrdev_open()
   try_module_get(fops->owner)
   watchdog_open()
      try_module_get(wdops->owner)
      wdops->start()
vfs_write
   watchdog_write()
      wdops->keepalive()
...
fput()
   watchdog_release()
       wdops->stop()
       module_put(wdops->owner)
   module_put(fops->owner)
This would practically do the same for the watchdog layer that we already
do for inside vfs for the file_operations.
