Sure, there are systems with multiple root buses (I'm a bit fuzzy on 
how well Linux handles that), and bandwidth is important, but it's 
simply wrong to assume that a particular root bus will never have 
more than 6 or 8 devices. There are legitimate cases (firewalls 
spring to mind) where port count is driven by other considerations 
than aggregate bandwidth.
