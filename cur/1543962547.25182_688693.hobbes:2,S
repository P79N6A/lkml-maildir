I think this is normal; PCIe defines transactions in terms of dwords, to a 64 
bit write would indeed be a transaction packet with a length of two (it can 
go up to 4k).  AFAIK though transactions are processed as a whole, so even a 
4k write (as long as it's generated as a single transaction) won't result in 
the device seeing e.g. 2x2k writes.  I'd have to double check the routing 
rules to be 100% sure though, maybe in some cases the fabric is allowed to 
break up transactions (?).
