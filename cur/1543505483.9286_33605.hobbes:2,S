Hi all,
All of you that are having this problem. Could you reply to me with:
a) type of ISA cards (as specific as possible, especially SCSI and
sound)
b) verify that you do not run SCSI/EIDE in non bus master mode.
c) attach a output from vmstat 2 > vmstat.out 
   (play sound, start this command, wait 5 secs, start disk activity,
    wait 5 secs, stop vmstat with ^C
    This was checked on Wakkos machine, and it indicated that no bus
    mastering / DMA was used.
    Note: my SB16SCSI II does not have DMA enabled by default... and
          ISA cards can not do bus mastering on their own.)
   
[I will make a summary]
PS.
I do think that this is related (until proven otherwise)

But make sure that you are using Bus Master EIDE / dma transfers since
it does not handle that yet !
