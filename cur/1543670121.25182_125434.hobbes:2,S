I get an Oops (Cannot dereference NULL kernel pointer) for the ls 
process in the following series of  commands:
cd /proc/
cat stat
ls
I am running vanilla 2.5.67 on a Duron without ksyms, so I'll need to 
recompile before I send a ksymoops, but the stack trace looked like it 
was coming from some filesystem functions. Has this already been fixed 
or will I need to send a ksymoops report?
