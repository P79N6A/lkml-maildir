Ok, I should reformulate, that currently not every machine has support
in kernel. Obviously each machine has a clock which runs faster than
jiffies.
And as a side note - kevents were created half a year ago - there were
no hrtimers in kernel in that time, btw, does kernel have high-resolutin
clock engine already in?

Getting into account that system call gets more than 100 nsec, and one
should create kevent and then read it (with at least three rescheduling
- after two syscalls and wake up), it is not exactly the best way to
obtain nanoseconds resolution. And even one usec is good one for
userspace, and I can create an interface through kevents, but let's get
it real - if we still can not agree on other issues, should we do it
right now? I would like kevent core's issues are resolved and everyone
become happy with it before adding new kevent users.
If everyone says "yes, replace usual timers with high-resolution ones",
then ok, I will schedule it for the next patchset.
