So smbfs is still considered rock solid while no serious distribution 
would be crazy enough to ship the EXPERIMENTAL NFSv4 support to their 
customers?
I'm not claiming that all EXPERIMENTAL tags were wrong [1], but many

Plus the fact that CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL controlled so many different

The fact that Andrew has not applied a three times sent patch does not 
necessarily imply there was any problem with a patch - "no answer" on 
linux-kernel always translates to "continue patchbombing".
