I have a potential use for mmap()ing in the low 4GB on x86_64.
Sounds like your MAP_32BIT really is MAP_31BIT :-( which is too limiting.
What about a more generic way of indicating which parts of the address
space one wants? The simplest that would work for me is a single byte
'nrbits' specifying the target address space as [0 .. 2^nrbits-1].
This could be specified on a per-mmap() basis or as a settable process attribute.
