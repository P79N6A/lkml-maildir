Subject: [BUG] tulip:  promisc mode not restored after suspend

The tulip driver is really great, but after suspending the device, the driver 
does not restore the promisc bit when resuming from S1/S3/S4.
To work around this, an ifconfig eth0 up, on the already up device, restores 
it.
Is there an easy way to fix this?
Thanks!
