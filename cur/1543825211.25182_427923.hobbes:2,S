Well the web page for the mainboard does say Integrated 10/100 Mb MAC,
which would be part of the nvidia chipset.  Being 100Mbit certainly
means it should work with forcedeth.  At least if the kernel is new
enough to recognize the chipset.

Well I don't know if XP added support for nvidia's network feature in
any of the service packs.  I do know it works with forcedeth on all the
nvidia boards I haved used, although I have only used their 100Mbit
versions.  There seemed to be a problem with 2.6.8 on some boards where
the nvidia MAC would not be detected, but manually loading forcedeth
worked anyhow.  Later kernels seemed to have no such problem.
