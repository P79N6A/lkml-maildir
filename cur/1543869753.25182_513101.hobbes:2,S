Well, the thinkpad firmware doesn't know how to turn the backlight off, or
doesn't export that AFAIK.  It *can* do it in hardware (cuts power to the
inverter or somesuch in the lid switch, etc) but I know of no way to do it
using the firmware.  If I ever find a way, I will certainly add it.
The video card *can* do it, but we are talking either intel fb or radeon fb
here, I'd need a way to communicate with them, or they should be getting the
same events and doing it anyway.

I will implement that, and as usual I will request your ACK since it deals
with your subsystem too.
