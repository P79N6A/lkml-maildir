yeah, that would help. But generally it a big PITA to figure out such 
bugs where there's no specific 'smoking gun' in the oopses themselves. 
What usually happens is that people try to figure out a faster way of 
triggering the bug - and then bisection can be done. But the hardware 
must be eliminated first as the cause of the bug. Taking out half of the 
RAM (i know it's painful ...) can help too in isolating RAM problems.
