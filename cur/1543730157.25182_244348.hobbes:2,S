Hiya
Could you try the driver from 
http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~pp/b44-095-2.tgz
 ,
which has some fixes that have been submitted but not yet merged. If that
doesn't help, the broadcom driver 
( 
http://www.broadcom.com/drivers/downloaddrivers.php
 ) might be
worth a try.
Also if you have more than 1Gb of memory, booting with mem=1024m 
might help (although with standard kernels with a 3:1
memory layout this hardware bug shouldn't get triggered and the typical
symptom is a complete hang). But it's worth a try in any case.
The updated driver mentioned above contains a workaround, so this shouldn't 
be needed anymore in any case.
Anyway, please report whether any of this helped.
