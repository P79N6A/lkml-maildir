If he pushes the lock_kernels() into the cases then not.
But even a few refactorings are not that bad if they result in
a BKL less SCSI.

Which have had years to convert their drivers, but they mostly didn't
do it. They need more incentive.

Yes I argue exactly that.

Has been proven to not work.
I don't really blame the maintainers too much. The implicit BKL in ioctl
is actually pretty obscure. But making it explicit will force their
hand.
So in short I'm sorry, but you're wrong on that.
