Oh, if you're compiling then IDE is probably contributing to the
problem. However, I thought you said you lost time when idling as well?

Ah, good call testing 2.4 w/ HZ=1000. Yea, as for the difference between
2.4 and 2.6-test, I'm guessing something in do_timer_interrupt_hook()
has grown. Booting a 586+ system w/ "clock=pit" and instrumenting that
function w/ rdtsc calls would probably show what has slowed down. 
Regardless, as you've demonstrated, it seems 486s just can't keep up w/
HZ=1000. Maybe we need to look into some sort of processor specific HZ
config option?
thanks
