Subject: [PATCH] fix floppy.c to store correct ro/rw status in underlying gendisk

Evgeny Stambulchik found that doing the following always worked:
# mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy/
mount: block device /dev/fd0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
# mount -o remount,rw /mnt/floppy
# echo $?
0
This is the case because the block device /dev/fd0 is writeable but the
floppy disk is marked protected. A fix is to simply have floppy_open
mark the underlying gendisk policy according to reality (since the VFS
doesn't provide a way for do_remount_sb to inquire as to the current
device status).
