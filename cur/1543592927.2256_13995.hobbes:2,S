Nice bit. One other bit from aa I think perhaps is usefull for SMP
(don't understand fully the difference, but if it makes cache usage better...)
is 00_pagetable-fast-2.
And one other thing (that has not appeared on the list again) is
the patch for single-copy-pipes. I have
been using it since it was out on ac kernels without problems (well, a small
one in the beginning).
Both attached (against 2.4.5-ac5).
