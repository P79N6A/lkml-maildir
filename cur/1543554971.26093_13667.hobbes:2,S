_MUCH_ better now!!!  no lockups anymore, no memory leak(s).
BUT:  there is still this small performace and memory usage issue:
each of these CDs contains >80k files in ~110 directories each
(the full db consists of 18 CDs!) and running "find" or "du"
on one CDROM (or 4MB isofs loop mount from hard disk) takes
a huge amount of time (real and system cpu) with cold cache:
	time find /cdrom
	0.610u 97.250s 1:40.58 97.2%    0+0k 0+0io 98pf+0w
flush cache...
	time du /cdrom
	0.470u 97.220s 1:40.29 97.4%    0+0k 0+0io 112pf+0w
whereas with hot cache (takes ~45MB memory off the value
for "free + buffer/cache" for a 4MB isofs image!) gives (PPro200, 128MB):
	time find /cdrom
	0.460u 1.280s 0:01.79 97.2%     0+0k 0+0io 102pf+0w
	time du /cdrom
	0.270u 1.260s 0:01.54 99.3%     0+0k 0+0io 108pf+0w
so it seems to work  (data still not checked, can do this only next week)
but performace really sucks :(
anyway, thanks a lot for your help and quick patch !  
now at least we can copy all the data to some hard disk
and use it that way.  
a patch for 2.2.x (the real production machine can't run 2.4.x yet)
and/or fixes for the bad performace would be appreciated anyway ;^)
thanks!
Harald
