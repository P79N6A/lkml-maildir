Dear All,
I have a problem with a program named Gaussian (
http://www.gaussian.com
)
(versions g98 or g03) and FC 4.0 (default kernel 2.6.11): I am used to take
Gaussian binaries compiled on the RedHat 9.0 version, and used them on FC 2.0
or FC 3.0. If I try to do so, on FC 4.0. (with the default kernel) Gaussian
stops (both g98 and g03 versions) with the following error message:
[fyd@localhost ~]$ g98 < toto-g98.com> toto-g98.log
[fyd@localhost ~]$ g03 < toto-g03.com> toto-g03.log
Erroneous write during file extend. write 208 instead of 4096
Probably out of disk space.
Write error in NtrExt1: No such file or directory
And obviously, I do _not_ have any problem of space and no NFS server on my
machine...
Now if I compile and use the kernel 2.6.12, this message dispears and the
program Gaussian g98 works fine, but I still have problems with the version g03
which stops without providing any message...
From my tests, it seems to be a problem relative to the kernel. Being not a
programmer, it is difficult for me to imagine the problem, and even to describe
it...
Any idea what could be the problem ? Any suggestions about options I should
use/not_use in the kernel, or about a specific kernel 2.6 version I should use
?
Thank you, best regards, Francois
