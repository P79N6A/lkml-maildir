Subject: [PATCH] Make sure UART is powered up when dumping MCTRL status
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/9/233

Since serial devices are powered down when not in use and some of those
devices cannot be accessed when powered down, we need to enable power
around calls to get_mcrtl() when dumping port state via uart_line_info().
This resolves hangs observed on some machines while reading serial device
registers when a port is powered off.

FYI: I've posted the above to the linux-serial mailing list but have not
received any additional feedback after reworking to incorporate changes
recommended via that mailing list.  That thread ends here:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-serial/msg00196.html
I'm now posting this reworked version to linux-kernel to move this along.
TIA for comments/feedback!
