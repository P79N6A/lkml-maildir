The code behaves in exactly the same way with the bit depth set to 32
and without the patch reversion (ie forces a reboot).
With the parch reverted there is a flicker of output on the screen
before a reboot is forced (it will boot with 16bpp though the colour
is a bit iffy)
With the patch reverted and 24bpp, it oopses before freezing (with two
odd looking boot logos on the screen):

In short all versions of the driver seem to be broken in some way, but
it won't boot at all unless the patch is reverted
