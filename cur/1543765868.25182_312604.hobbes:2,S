Not really.  I don't see how it makes it any better or easier, just
different.

Probably under 1 ms.  Not long anyhow.

it requires magic like a compiler and knowledge of the original

if the application was written sensibly someone without access to the
application code could change this live taking over the previous
applications state even more easily --- and the code would be more
