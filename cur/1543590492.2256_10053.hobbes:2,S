The ext2 indexing patch is apparently stable but it's still pre-alpha 
until the hash function is finalized.  I could see using it to run 
performance tests of ext2+indexing against the alternatives, but only 
if you are prepared to rerun mke2fs later.  Then there is the matter of 
making fsck index-aware.  As it stands now, if fsck finds an index it 
will remove it.
But by all means please test the patch:
  
http://nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/dx.testme-2.4.4-4
It would be great to see a table of ReiserFS/XFS/Ext2+index performance 
results.  Well, to make it really fair it should be Ext3+index so I'd 
better add 'backport the patch to 2.2' or 'bug Stephen and friends to 
hurry up' to my to-do list.
