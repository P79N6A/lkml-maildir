Hello,
I am not shure that this is the correct list for my question.
I am trying to find out how to re initalise a pci card after its 
identity has been programmed in. I think this could be similar to hot 
plug PCI functions but have no experience with this.
We currently reboot the computer after running insmod with a module that 
programs the identity eeprom attached to a PLX 9050 PCI bus interface 
chip. We then run production testing.
Any assistance would be wellcome, How to or where to look etc.
Thankyou in advance.
Peter Wintulich
