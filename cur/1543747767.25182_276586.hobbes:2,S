Grr. This appears that .32-0 is MUCH WORSE than 31.15 at
keeping the relatively small (100 usec) latencies down.
Probably due to the CPU task switch that prevents the
longer ones from occurring. The MAX CPU latencies are down
in most cases (over 4 msec down to about 3 msec) which
is a good result.
The long elapsed times appear to indicate that we are
starving the "stress test" application (and likely
running the niced, non RT cpu_burn instead).
