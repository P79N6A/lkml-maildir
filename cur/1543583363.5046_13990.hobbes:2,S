Yeah, mount --bind is cool, I've been using it on one of my projects
today.  But - maybe I'm just not thinking creatively enough - what are
the advantages of mount --bind versus just symlinking?
Also, I tried mount --bind fileone filetwo, and it fails if filetwo
doesn't exist. ('mount point filetwo doesn't exist').  Is that supposed
to work?  (using mount from latest redhat beta)
BTW, pivot_root is nifty, too. ;-)
