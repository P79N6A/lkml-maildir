The problem is that it appears to the casual observer as if they can
then add information to the bug through the web interface.  But that
information will never be forwarded to the mailing list.  Unless there's
a way of marking bugs as 'unchangable through the web interface' or 'all
messages appended to this bug need to be forwarded', Bugzilla just
doesn't fit our needs.
The Debian BTS fits our way of working much better.  Perhaps somebody
should investigate a migration.
