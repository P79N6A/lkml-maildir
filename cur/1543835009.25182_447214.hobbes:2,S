Ok, this seems to be related to the changes in:
	vdso-hash-style-fix.patch
Backing this out reverses the new behaviour.
It looks like the check to see if the options are valid, use -o 
/dev/null -xc /dev/null and that is causing the compiler to remove 
/dev/null.
The machines affected do not seem to have such old compilers:	
	gcc version 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-3)
Yeah, yeah I know I should not be running my builds as root, but then we 
should not be eating it either.
