Sorry but in 2.5.2 pre9 (i make a mistake in the topic, is 2.5.2pre9 , no 
2.5.1pre9):
kernel.h:
#define BUG_ON(condition) do { if (unlikely((condition)!=0)) BUG(); } while(0)
So i don't understand Alan's complaims, if i understands it well, BUG_ON() is 
just a optimization of BUG function. 
So in simple "if (condition) BUG()" cases i think it will allways be replaced 
, of course in "if (condition) someWork; BUG()" we can't.
