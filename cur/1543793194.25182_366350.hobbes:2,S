Well if ipw2100 works on one machine for one person, obviously ipw2200 
must be correct as well. I never said they didn't work anywhere, and I 
have no old 2100 hardware.
But the new {firm,soft}ware works and gives the same results as XP, 
while the default says there are no usable signals in range. And like it 
or not, it has to work at least as well as Windows on the same machine 
to be considered functional. Many devices work better.
