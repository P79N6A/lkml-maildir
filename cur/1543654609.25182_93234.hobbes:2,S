Does the kernel work if data structures are in ROM?  I would think that
lots of variables in the kernel would have this problem :)
And yes, patching other people's data structures isn't the nicest thing
to do, but it was the simplest proposal I've come up with so far (we've
had a lot of other pretty "odd" proposals for this problem in the past.)

Oops, forgot that, I'll go fix it up.
