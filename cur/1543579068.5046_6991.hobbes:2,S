Currently mount(8) supports mounting by '-L <label>' and '-U <UUID>'. 
Most modern mke2fs proggies will assign a UUID to each newly created
filesystem.  For /etc/fstab, you can specify LABEL=xxx or UUID=xxx
instead of a device name.
The one thing I don't know is... can the kernel mount the root fs if
only given the uuid?
