I agree. "clone()" says "I want to copy these things".
"unshare()" says "I want to un-copy these things". So it makes sense that
a "unshare(CLONE_FILES)" basically _undoes_ the sharing of
"clone(CLONE_FILES)".

Not unreasonable.
Anyway, this is all 2.5.x..  I'd like to get at least some basic support
for pthreads compatibility if we can do it trivially in 2.4.x, but these
kinds of changes are not necessary for that at this point.
