Hi Rene,
Can't think of any reason why we can't keep alignment uppper limit to
16M. That time I had kept 4M as upper limit as that seemed to be only
practical usage.
Rencetly I have restored back CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START option. That patch
is still in -mm. IMHO, your case will fit more if we set
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START to 16M rather than increasing alignment upper limit
for CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN.

Andrew, Can you please push this patch to 2.6.20-rc3?
Thanks
Vivek
