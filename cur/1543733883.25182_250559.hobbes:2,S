these traces happen if you forget to do 'dmesg -n 1' to turn off console
output. One CPU does a latency-printout with interrupts disabled, and
this CPU keeps waiting in flush_tlb_others(). The second do_nmi() entry
(which is a special one, showing the other CPU's activity) indeed shows
that the CPU is executing in kallsyms_lookup() - possibly it's in the
middle of a latency printout.
i havent seen such type of traces with 'dmesg -n 1'.
