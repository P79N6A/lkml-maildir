However, results are similar. 
2.6 seems to work better than 2.4 in "early stage of stable branch" but
It's quite impossible to set up a production server on 2.6.x, optimize
it and keeping the same performance with 2.6.(x+2).
Iosched has a lot of flavours, with performance worse than 2.4 (at least
for databases). 
Swap is a misterious thing and It needs a degree in swappiness to
understand how it works and how it changes.
I see a lot of efforts in making a top-performance kernel but these
efforts are not compatible with a stable-tree.
Stable means not only that the kernel does not hangs, but that features
remains (almost) the same for a reasonable amount of time.
