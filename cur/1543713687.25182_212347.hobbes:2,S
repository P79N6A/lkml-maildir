Well a simple but dumb way is to poll using the timer list, i.e. set up a timer 
at the first entry were things "might" work and if the driver is not yet, do a 
timer to come back in 1 tick, and keep doing it for each tick until it is 
available.  This puts it all on the kgdb side.
The other way is with a call back list which would be managed by common OE code. 
  This would put most of the code in that area.  I tend to like call back lists 
that one registers for by passing in a structure which contains a "list_head" 
member.  That way there is no memory allocation on either end.  The manager, on 
a register call, just puts the new structure in its call back list.  The struct 
would have the list_head member and a function member, and the function would be 
called with the struct address as its only parameter.  This allows for an 
expanded struct if more complex info is needed.
