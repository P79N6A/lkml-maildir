Try powertweak (text mode version), that can also yield pretty verbose
DMI etc. data. Might just provide that extra bit of information you need.
But with DMI info about the board manufacturer it should be very easy
to find on the internet what RAM type the board supports anyway!?

Yes, iff the board has both DDRAM and SDRAM slots (ECS K7S5A comes to mind,
most popularly).

Almost all boards are *either* SDRAM *or* DDRAM, to my knowledge,
only a couple boards during the transition phase offered both slot types.
