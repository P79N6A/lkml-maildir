Just tried 2.4.0-t9p8 + t9p8-vmpatch: No change here. Box appears
to hang upon "init 2" (or higher) when starting several things (sendmail,
xfs e.g.) with (according to SysRq+p) idle_task being the only one R.
However, if I just wait for some 15 minutes or so it finally reaches
the console login prompt - but I'm unable to login, since this seems
to require the same duration, so the login timeout is killing me.
Things seem to speed up, when *continously* pressing SysRq+[tpm]:
Besides screen scrolling there is some minor disk activity, but always
EIP in idle_task. Looks similar to what somebody else reported.
Problem appeares for the first time when switching from vanilla t9p7 to
t9p8+t9p[78]-vmpatch (Haven't tried vanilla t9p[89]).
Will try 2.4.0-test9 (final).

Willing to try the patch for this when available.

Martin
