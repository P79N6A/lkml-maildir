Hi all,
I have been trying to set up network booting with Kernel 2.6.18.2 and have the problem that IP: kernel level autoconfig seems not to work, I tried both DHCP and BOOTP.
I cannot see any dhcp or bootp requests beeing issued to my dhcp server except the initial one by the network card. When autoconfig should happen (the card is recognised, and the driver loaded), the kernel prints the following:
IP-Config: Guessing netmask 255.0.0.0
IP-Config: Complete:
  device=eth0, addr=10.110.169.221, mask=255.0.0.0, gw=255.255.255.255,
  host=10.110.169.221, domain=, nis-domain=(none),
  bootserver=255.255.255.255, rootserver=255.255.255.255, rootpath=
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up
10.110.169.221 is my servers address, the client should get .116, but as I said no BOOTP od DHCP request is sent ...
Best regards,
Marco Schwarz
