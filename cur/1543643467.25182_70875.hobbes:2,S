I just had an idea: There are the periodic discussions about 
dumping the oops-report somewhere where you can log it on the next 
boot, right?
Disk drivers may be unreliable etc etc. 
Main memory is probably cleared on boot, right? (would have been too
obvious). 
I'm pretty sure that my system has 16M of non-cleared memory: The
video RAM. The state of my screen  before the crash always shows up 
while X is starting.... (I was running a foolishly old 2.4.3-ac3 until
a couple of weeks ago)
Is my system special in that it doesn't clear video RAM? Can we 
grab a pointer to video memory when we boot, check a magic 
value, if OK, print the oops report from last crash, put in a new
magic value ("No oops report"), and when we crash write in the 
crash report with the special magic value?
