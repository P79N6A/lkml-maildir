 I think the programming specs for a 3D graphics card can tell you
very little about it, the R200 specs are very good but I doubt anyone
would have a clue how to design the internals of the card just from
looking at them, and now that GPUs are getting more like CPUs in terms
of shaders and programming languages the specs are getting less and
less useful to tell what is actually going on....
The main reasons they don't like open source is from where I'm
standing, their IP lawyers and probably not being able to do sneaky
hacks in the driver because people can see them..
