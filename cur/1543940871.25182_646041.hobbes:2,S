While pondering ways to optimize I/O and swapping on large NUMA machines, I 
noticed that the numa_node field in struct device isn't actually used anywhere. 
  We just have a couple dozen lines of code to conditionally create a sysfs file 
that will always return -1.  Is anyone even working on code to actually use this 
field?  I think it's a good piece of information to keep track of, so I'm not 
suggesting we remove it, but I want to make sure I'm not stepping on toes or 
duplicating effort if I try to make it useful.
