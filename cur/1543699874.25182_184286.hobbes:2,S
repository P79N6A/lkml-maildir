Daube. Thanks for the work.
If you have some spare time, you can try the patches available at:
<URL:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.0-test11-bk5>
(a README describes the order).
They will not fix the issue but I would not be too surprized if something
breaks before "rtl8169_hw_phy_config" appears.
I'll be away from my computer until wednesday evening.
