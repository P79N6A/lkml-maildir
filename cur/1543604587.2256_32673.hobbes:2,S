It seems that the new EMU10K driver no longer has a PCM mixer channel.
Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.16, 15:28:05 Oct 12 2001
PCI: Enabling device 00:0a.0 (0004 -> 0005)
PCI: Assigned IRQ 5 for device 00:0a.0
emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 8 model 0x8027 found, IO at 0xa400-0xa41f, IRQ 5
ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: 0x5452:0x4123 (TriTech TR?????)
Per default I have the following mixer channels:
volume, speaker, line, microphone, cd, igain, line1, phonein, phoneout,
video.
Additionally I have added two mixer channels via emu-dspmgr userspace
tools: bass, treble
Does the new driver require userspace configuration for the PCM mixer
or has it just vanished mysteriously?
Regards,
-Udo.
