	By the way, I am completely ignorant of any platform besides the x86, but
	devhd.c seems to imply that DOS style partitions are also supported on the
	other platforms? Does Linux on these platforms actually live in these
	partitions, or do they allready use something a little more sane?
	Kind regards,

On alpha's it is quite common to find DOS style partition tables.
(Say, used by WinNT, and by ARC console boot.)
