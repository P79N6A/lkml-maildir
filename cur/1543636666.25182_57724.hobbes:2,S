Not from our experience from a cluster based application. Each node was 
a SMP in that case.
On a single SMP I could imagine for instance for parallel reendering
or similar tightly integrated parallel programs that need data 
synchronization.  Most of these apps assume a tightly coupled non-virtual
resource, i.e., scheduling of tasks is aligned.
SGI used to have that stuff in their base kernel. Read a paper about this some 
years ago.
Again, at the beginning I'd go with a user level scheduler approach that 
certainly would satisfy national labs etc. Most of the cluster schedulers, 
like PBS and LoadLeveler etc., already provide that functionality.
