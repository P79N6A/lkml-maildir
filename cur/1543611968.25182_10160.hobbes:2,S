I'm pretty sure that's true any more, Alan.  Red Hat shipped Python 2 in
7.1, so the RPM-based distros like KRUD and Mandrake have had it for
seven months. Debian had it before that.   
Requiring 2.0 looked aggressive when I did it, but it wasn't -- I could
safely project that it would be deployed everywhere except on a set of
measure zero by the time the actual cutover happened.
