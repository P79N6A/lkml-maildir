I'm just going to take your word on this since you have messed with far 
more video bioses than I.  I've just got a few too many scars over the 
years from trying to make the whole BIOS sub-system robust enough for 
embedded standards.

Exactly. Which is why I like your project and I think its a good thing. 
    The only reason I have to carry around the legacy BIOS baggage is 
for video.
How big is your in-kernel implementation?
