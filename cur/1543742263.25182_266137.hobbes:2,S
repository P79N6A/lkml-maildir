Naah.  I have a piix chipset.  My problem (per David Hinds) is that my laptop is 
even more b0rken than yours - IBM never hooked up the PCI INTx lines on the TI 
1130.  My laptop never worked with Cardbus stuff - even in Windows.
He reccommended the external pcmcia_cs package for my system - there's a dummy_cs 
module in there (2.4 only, though) that should fix my problem.
Thanks,
Jim
