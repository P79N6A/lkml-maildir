s/currently running/running now or in the future/
But apart from that, it does really reduce the window, agreed.
An alternative approach would simply zero all freed memory in the
system, with almost identical effects. Almost means you are missing
memory (that isn't cleared on reboot on all systems, ...) and this is
missing hard disk recovery that can read data already overwritten.
Arguments against this simpler approach?
