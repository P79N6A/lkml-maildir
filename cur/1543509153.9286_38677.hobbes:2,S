	64-bit kernel can DIRECTLY address entire 64-bit address
	range (and the processor can do 64-bit addresses).
	Processor isn't (with Linux kernels) considered 64-bit one,
	unless it can do addressing of large address spaces without
	resorting to tricks like (external) memory mapping hardware
	giving enlarged physical memory address spaces thru mapping
	windows.
	In case of dual-mode systems the user-spaces are often only
	32-bit (sometimes also 64-bit), while the kernel is definitely
	64-bit.  (As is the case with Ultra-SPARC systems.)
	With Alphas the userspaces has always been 64-bit, and now
	recently there has been some push to create functional 32-bit
	userspace.

	64-bit addressing is required.
	PCI-bus (addresses of the I/O) is usually 32-bit only, which gives
	weird problems when trying to address thru it to system main memory
	(or to other PCI busses.)
	Often e.g. Floating-point things are done in 64 or 80 or 96 bit
	resolution, and in such cases, would you want to call such processor
	e.g. 80-bit ?
	Consider 8087 floating-point co-processor used with 8088 processor.
	A weird system with segmented 64 kB memory blocks with segments
	providing address space enlargement to "whopping" 1 MB.  Yet the
	system ran with 8-bit data bus, and had 16 bit arithmetic registers.
	It was a precursor system for 80386, and much latter, Pentiums.
	What would that have been ?
	- 20 bit (complete segmented addresses) ?
	- 16 bit (addressing mode registers) ?
	- 80-bit (floating-point registers in the coprocessor) ?
	(Back then it was referred as '16 bit' per integer arithmetics it
	 was able to do in the registers.)
	(At the time Motorola had 68000, which was referred as 16/32-bit,
	 which had 24 bit external address bus, but 16 bit data bus, and
	 32-bit registers..)
