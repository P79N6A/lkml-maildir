Hmm, "sneaked"... Good start, Christoph.

They must be added in the same file and line to allow easy control.
It is not directory like char/.

What? Does following code also kills redzoning?
int *a;
a = kmalloc();
if (a)
{
	memset(a, 0, sizeof(*a));
	kfree(a);
}
Consider size of the dev_chain structure...

Because it is not just list_head, but special structure used for special
pointer manipulations,
which you are obviously saw in sc.c

Sigh.
Christoph, please read the code before doing such comments.
I very respect your review and opinion, but only until you respect
others.

Yep, it can be a problem, thank you.

Christoph, do you know what SuperIO is?
I doubt...
It is a small chip, which can include various number of devices.
SuperIO currently supports only GPIO and ACB, so this header only
includes
one define. I do not have hardware(sc1100 based for example) that
"exports"
other devices and which can be accessed from the outside of the board, 
so I did not add other defines.
But specially for you I can remove this file, will it satisfy you?

It is almost the same like after hand waving say that there is a wind.
Each lock protect it's own data, sometimes it happens when other data is
locked, 
sometimes not. Yes, probably interrupt handling can race, it requires
more review,
I will take a look.
Below is part of the announce in lm_sensors@ which probably will throw
light on your
claims.
************
Main goal was to be able to link any registered SuperIO chip with any
number of registered logical devices. Next step is to add ability to
communicate with SuperIO subsystem from userspace.
External kernel modules may access to logical devices using
sc_{get,put}_ldev() and in similar way to SuperIO chip drivers -
sc_{get,put}_sdev().
Driver writers shoud use sc_{add,del}_logical_dev() and
sc_{add,del}_sc_dev() to accordingly add/remove logical devices and
SuperIO chip drivers.
Any SuperIO chip driver must provite at least 2 functions:
->probe() and ->activate_one().
The former is called with different HW addresses and should return 0 if
device was found there or negative error value.
The latter is called each time new logical device being added with
pointer to it's logical device structure. It should return 0 if logical
device was found to be active or negative error value.
Any logical device must provide 4 functions:
->activate() - it is used to activate logical device.
->read()/write() - what do you think, it is used to read and write
from/to logical device registers.
->control() - it is used to control access to logical device. Actually
it is private combination of ->read()/write() functions but is providede
for convenience.
********************
Resume:
Cristoph, you rudely try to show that this code is badly broken.
It is not.
It was tested as opposed to your claims, and works as expected.
To be more productive please next time be polite and respect others, 
or you will be just ignored no matter how strong your knowledges are.
Talk is cheap, show me the code, that is broken, and I will fix it.
Thank you.
