 From the GCC manual: "The compiler assumes that dereferencing a null 
pointer would have halted the program. If a pointer is checked after it 
has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null. In some environments, 
this assumption is not true, and programs can safely dereference null 
pointers. Use -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks to disable this 
optimization for programs which depend on that behavior. "
