Subject: [PATCH] don't delete debian directory in official debian builds

Hi,
Somewhere along the 2.6 series, there was a change made that causes
distclean to automatically delete the debian/ subdirectory from the top
of the kernel tree.  This causes grief for the official debian kernel
packages; the debian directory shouldn't be deleted in the packages.
Please apply the attached patch; it causes the debian/ subdirectory to
only be deleted if there's no debian/official.
An even better solution would be to mark the debian directory as being
created by the kernel (touch debian/linus), and only delete it if the
kernel created it.
