that's why alloc_pages should return the same thing for every user.

100 kernel developers, who cares about saving some cycles in 100
machines? Get real.

Now I get a crash in swap resume (I cannot test swap resume yet, at
least now swap suspend works). Could be the same bug you triggered.
We'll see.

slab code may be using multipages too. Anyways I had no time to look
into it yet, so give me a bit of time, I need to fix swap resume now,
after that works I'll check if your bug can be explained by the same
issue that swap resume has right now, and if not I'll fix it, then I'll
do mprotect merging (for file mappings too!).
