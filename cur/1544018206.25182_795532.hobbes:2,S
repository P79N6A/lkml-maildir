Only if your router/firewall/webserver isn't hitting that code path
which bumps the counters you think aren't hot path.
It's a micro-DoS waiting to happen if we start trying to split
counters up into groups which matter for hot path processing
(and thus use per-cpu stuff) and those which don't (and thus
use atomics or whatever your idea is).
