Hi Patrick
I've tried those patches with 2.6.6 and I see the same behaviour,
packets do not traverse POSTROUTING chain in nat table (and thus they
are not s-natted).
What I did was to manually aply the following patches from
patch-o-matic-ng-20040621 to a vanilla 2.6.6 tree:
nf_reset
ipsec-01-output-hooks
ipsec-02-input-hooks
ipsec-03-policy-lookup
ipsec-04-policy-checks
did I miss something? (I understood from your email and from
patch-o-matic-ng-20040621/ipsec-*/info files that this was enough, maybe
it wasn't... O:-).

I can wait until then, no problem...
Thanks a lot for responding.
