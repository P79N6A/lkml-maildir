Hm, I complained about this last time, with no response...
I didn't think that git pulls were going to be allowed from subsystem
maintainers after -rc1 came out.  After that, patches by email were
required to be sent, not git pulls.  This does cause a bit more work
for the maintainer, but it ensures that they only send the patches they
really want to get in.
At least that was what I thought we decided on at the kernel summit...
thanks,
greg k-h
