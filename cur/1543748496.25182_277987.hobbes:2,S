Does it really? If /etc and /tmp reside on the same filesystem, only a rename()
is done as to my knowledge (and possibly, an fs-specific rebalance). And if
they are on the same fs, they might even keep the inode number.

(Your mentioning of hardlinks proves my assumption of you having /etc and /tmp
on the same fs.)
