I've got an Asus M2400E laptop, and have seen similar things.  After a
suspend, the extra buttons (I use them to fire up programs) stop
working.  Normally, they will generate an ACPI event, that is
processed by acpid etc.  After a suspend, each button will work once.
If I then close and open the lid, they will work one more time, and so
on.  Any way I can help?
