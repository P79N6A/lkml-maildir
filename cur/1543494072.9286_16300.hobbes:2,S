It's not really a bugfix but I think it's better. The only meaning of the
the referenced bit now has to be to reorder the lru list, not at all to
drive swapout or not. I did such change because it looked better in low
memory to swapout more, but it was not the right thing to do.
If somebody will try out 2.2.6_andrea4.bz2 with and then w/o the patch
above let me know (let me know the details of your memory too ;).
Thanks.
