Just didn't describe it in that summary ... like several other
standard attributes, like "uevent" and "subsystem".  The only
thing different about "device" is that when the gpio_chip doesn't
say what device it uses, that will (necessarily) be missing.
And again, that's just like all other class device nodes.

Yeah, gotta fix that.  Unfortunately "-0" == "0" ... I'll have to
handle any leading "-" by hand.  Trivial fix, in all.
