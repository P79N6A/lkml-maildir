	Nice to see somebody is pushing this. I am getting fed up wtih
	applying these to every 2.4.xx.
	Note that with GCC >= 3.x(Not sure about "x", definitely 3.2), the P4 
compile option correctly
	generates add/sub instructions instead of the "P4 killer" inc/dec.
	Of course, in include/asm-i386, we still have incs/decs in
	processor.h, atomic.h, rwsem.h, semaphore.h uaccess.h, system.h,
	string.h, spinlock.h and smplock.h.
	With the patches and changing the includes, I can get a 5-10% improvement
	with a hefty DB app on a UP P4 which isn't to be sneezed at.
	And perhaps somebody should take a squint at the "copy_xxx_user".
	IMHO, this really should be inlined.
	Try running a DB app which bounces semaphores at a terrific rate and what
	do you see at the top of readprofile ? Yep, you guessed it.
