Using very fast HDs and the sym53c8xx driver, the command overhead
(everything minus DATA transfer) can be lower than 70 micro-seconds for a
875, without disconnections and probably not more than 100 micro-seconds
with un single diconnection per transfer. 
(Btw, the ncr53c8xx should not have a significantly higher command
overhead with the 875, may be less than 20%)
The benchmarks that have been used basically are measuring sequential
access speed and given the read-ahead performed by the the kernel, actual
IOs size are in average larger than 64 KB.
Using your 2 drives on a single BUS, the bandwidth used is less than:
20 MB/sec = half of the BUS bandwidth (50%)
20 MB/64K = 312 tps.
Even if the total command overhead of your drive is as high as 250
micro-second (2.5 times the driver/HA pair capabilities), the total
command overhead per second will be about:
 312*250us = 78 ms.
that represents less than 8% of the total BUS bandwidth.
Result is that your benchmarks are not able to use more than 58% of a 
single BUS bandwidth. You cannot expect in this situation to get
significant better performances by using 2 BUSes instead of 1 for your
benchmarks.
(With the ncr53c8xx driver load should be not more than 60% of the
bandwidth)
On the other hand, performing RAID using disks and/or disk areas that
haven't exactly the same characteristics is very unlikely to give additive
performances. The fastest transfer rate will synchronize with the slowest
one, and latency due to additionnal disk revolutions for synchronisation
(8.3 milli-second for a 7200 rpm driver) will also slow down the actual
data transfer rate. 
In my opinion, you are wasting time by trying to get any relevant
informations from your results. Results that are just a bit reversed
compared to expectations donnot seem significant to me, given the load and
different disks used for RAID. IMO, the minimal configuration that may
give usable results should load a single BUS by at least 70% of its
bandwidth and for the RAID benchmarks should apply to identical disks and
using same areas of each disk.
(Since I intentionnaly used higher number than reality should have been
for the estimation of the BUS load, the actual BUS load for your
benchmarks should have been not more than 50%).
