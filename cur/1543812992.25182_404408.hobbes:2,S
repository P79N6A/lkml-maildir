Actually quite alot of them do it for work, including Torvalds and Cox.

Unfortunately the license (GPL) was chosen along time ago and can't
really be changed at this point.

The real question is: Why do binary-only drivers need to exist?

GPL.
You could try direct your efforts at *BSD which has a more liberal
licensing policy.
Microsoft, for example, has a version of .NET for FreeBSD, but not
for Linux. Presumably because of the license differences.

Already in place. The "Tainted" flag.
In general: Binary drivers == bad.
After that, there are several levels of bad...
Besides... Looking at Win64, it looks like hardware manufacturers
have problems coming up with drivers... If they had done them
open-source for Linux or any other opensource operating system
in the first place, they'd most likely have less problems with the 64
bit transition right now.... Binary-only just hurts everyone.

The same here.
