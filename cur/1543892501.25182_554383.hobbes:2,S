Generally yes, maybe, but see arch/i386/kernel/cpu/bugs.c,
arch/i386/math-emu/. Generally there is nothing to it. I think the
feature to allow the kernel to use [i387] FP without manually
saving/restoring the FP stack has been added some time ago.

Now, if we could detect superfluous parentheses and branches,
that'd be cool ;-) there are too many if ((a < 5) || (b > 6)) around.
