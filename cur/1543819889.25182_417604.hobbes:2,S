Yep, it doesn't use PFNMAPs (we can always user the underlying struct
 page), nor is it IO space. The only change that should be seen, as
noted in patch 4/5, is that get_user_pages will work on all mappings
now. I don't think there is a downside to this?

That's only for PFNMAPs. COW should continue to work fine.

I hope so.

I initially did that when coding the function in mm/memory.c, but when
adding all the vmalloc range checking I tried to stick with vmalloc
convention.

Should I?
