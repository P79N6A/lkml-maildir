> The primary effect of the patch is to remove the MAX_BITMAP_BITS
I'm all in favor of that, and this appears one of the two
reasonable alternatives to accomplish that.
The other, perhaps, would be a single bit loop, but one
that went directly into the destination buffer.
That would be slower, smaller and easier to see by
inspection that it was probably right.
This bitmap shift routines receive limited use at present.
Offhand, I see only one use -- a bitmap_shift_right() in
bitmap_scnprintf(), and a few physids_shift macros, that
are in turn themselves unused.
This might argue for the slow, stupid, small solution ...
