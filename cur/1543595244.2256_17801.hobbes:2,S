May I suggested an algorithm?
  - Write down what you think the optimization constraints are.
    (be specific, for example, enumerate all the flavors of page types -
    process code, process data, page cache file data, page cache swap
    cache, anonymous, shmem, etc.)
  - Write down what you think the current algorithms are.
    (again, be specific, use file names, function names, pseudocode and 
    snippets of existing code.)
  - Send it to Rik.  He'll tell you if it's right.
  - Because life is short and should not be boring, cc it to Andrea as well
    ;-)
This way you save everybody's time and ensure you understand what's really 
going on.  Not to mention coming up with a document worth its weight in 
dilithium crystals.
