Subject: File corruption when using kernels 2.6.18+

I am using kernel 2.6.17.14, and would like to use newer versions for the wireless code but I get file corruption with any kernel 
more recent than this. My system uses a SiS645DX chipset (it is a rebadged CLEVO D400E) with 5513 IDE.
I get this corruption with read/writes, i.e using "cp", "dd", when compiling software, writing to CD, etc etc. An example:
cp ../Changelog-2.6.18 .
diff Changelog-2.6.18 ../Changelog-2.6.18

I would suspect a memory problem but memtest86+ gives no errors despite numerous passes, and I get no errors in older kernels. Does 
anyone have any idea what changed in 2.6.18 to cause such an error?
I have tried some obvious things (see thread on linuxquestions.org: 
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=578200
), but I don't understand enough about the kernel to get any further.
Neil.
