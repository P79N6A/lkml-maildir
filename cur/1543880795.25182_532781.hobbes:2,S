I'm not sure I correctly get your point, but according to
this comment:
" * cancel_rearming_delayed_work - reliably kill off a delayed
keventd work whose handler rearms the delayed work."
there is a question, whether a function that "rearms only if"
- "rearms". It seems the author of this comment didn't think
so and it was obvious to him/her cancel_rearming_delayed_work
wasn't intended for this case. At first I thought it's only a
language question - now, I see it's probably logical, too.
Cheers,
