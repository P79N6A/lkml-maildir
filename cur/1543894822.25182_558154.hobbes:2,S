The Coverity checker spotted the following obvious check-after-use in 
drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/dvb_net.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int dvb_net_close(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
...
        struct dvb_net *dvbnet = dvbdev->priv;
        if (!dvbdev)
                return -ENODEV;
...
<--  snip  -->

       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
