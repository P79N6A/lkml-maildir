Hi,
	After giving people time to subscribe, I've opened the Kernel
Summit 2006 discussion mailing list.  For people who want to
subscribe, please visit:
http://thunk.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ksummit-2006-discuss
	So to kick off the discussion, here are some topics for which
I and the program committee would invite input:
* How could the kernel summit be improved this year?
* What did you like and would like us to make sure we do again?
	* What sort of attendee gift should we go for this year?
	* What sort of food should be served?
* What topics are important for us to include on the agenda?  (This
	last is the most important!)
	In addition, if you have anybody in mind that you think the
progam committee should definitely keep in mind as someone we should
consider inviting to the kernel summit, please send a note to the
program committee mailing list (ksummit-2006-pc@thunk.org), or to me
directly.
	Thanks, and let the discussion begin.  (Given how folks love
to rip apart^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H offer constructive criticism for
improvement regarding patches, I'm sure you won't be shy.  :-)
