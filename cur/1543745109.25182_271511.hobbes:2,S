You can't schedule from an interrupt because, if (when) the
scheduled task calls the kernel to do something, the return
address, context info, etc., of the previously-interrupted
task will be overwritten and lost forever.
Now, VMS (solved) this non-problem, at great performance penalty,
by having a context-switch for everything. A hardware interrupt
generated a context-switch so the hardware interrupt could
certainly directly context-switch to a user-mode task. The
kernel was, itself, a task (called SWAPPER). When you called
the kernel (trapped to), a context-switch occurred and the
kernel did whatever in whatever order it wanted because it
didn't have to return to the caller right away (if ever).
In fact, it didn't even have to return to whatever got
interrupted. That task was just put into the queue of
runnable tasks.
The performance was nice for a single task that used, for
instance, a DR11 parallel-port board. An interrupt occurred
and the task got control right away after the data was
DMAed. Add more tasks and the system bogged down.
If you had 20 people compiling FORTRAN of a 11/780, it
took MINUTES to log in.
However, with such a system a high-priority task could
take the CPU away from anything. That meant that SYSTEM
could usually get control, assuming it was already logged
in. A dead driver was just marked unusable and everything
continued. Even dead RAM was able to marked unusable.
Unix was invented to bypass all this stuff. The kernel
is not a task. It is just some privileged shared code.
Therefore, it can execute quickly. The trade-off is
that you need to fix bad drivers.

You can't. Once the kernel code starts executing, it must behave.
