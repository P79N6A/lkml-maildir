It is the known situation with the compiler since the dawn of time, yes.
It just writes the file directly, so if it dies in the middle, there's a
file with a fresh date.  For things like this done in makefile commands
with >, it has forever been canonical for the anal to use:
	... > $@.new
	mv -f $@.new $@
which avoids the problem.  The kernel makefiles are entirely haphazard
about places that do this or don't.  It uglifies the commands, but avoids
the problem of freshly-dated but wrong/empty files from botched make runs.
I did not do this in cmd_vdsosym (though I did in cmd_vdso32sym, go figure).
Thanks,
Roland
