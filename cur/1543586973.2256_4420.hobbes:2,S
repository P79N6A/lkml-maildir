Heh. These multi-I/O-cards come in a lot of different fashions. Let me
explain the NetMos chips a bit:
My card shows up with lspci like that:
lizard:~ # lspci -s 00:0c -vn
00:0c.0 Class 0780: 9710:9835 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: 1000:0012
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 11
        I/O ports at 9400 [size=8]
        I/O ports at 9000 [size=8]
        I/O ports at 8800 [size=8]
        I/O ports at 8400 [size=8]
        I/O ports at 8000 [size=8]
        I/O ports at 7800 [size=16]
as you can see, it's class is PCI_CLASS_COMMUNICATION_OTHER
There are 8 different chips from Netmos, they differ mainly in the
number of serial and parallel ports:
9705  -/1P
9735 2S/1P
9745 2S/-
9805  -/1P
9815  -/2P
9835 2S/1P
9845 2S/-
9855  -/2P
the chip id is the same as the PCI device ID. So there are chips with
only serial or parallel ports, and chips with both of them. A chip
without a parallel port (9845) does not really belong to
parport/parport_serial.c :-) On the other hand, a chip without a serial
port should have nothing to do whith serial.c.
At the moment there is a clean solution: serial.c contains only the
device ids of cards with serial ports, the same for parport_pc.c
to summarize the discussion, there are 3 possible solution. I wanted a
simple _and_ clean solution, this seems impossible. 
The simple solution: Gunters 'multifunction quirks'
clean solution #1: a new module according to Jeffs sample code
clean solution #2: 'invisible PCI bridge' from Linus
For both clean solutions I don't know how autoloading/hotplugging would
be handled. But they look good, especially Linus' one.
The simple solution would be _very_ easy to integrate, would not break
existing configurations, and would not require any design changes.
Suggestion: multifunction quirks for 2.4, one of the clean solutions for
2.5?
