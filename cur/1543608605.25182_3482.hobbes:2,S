IE if you put in code to queue a cache a subdirectory when it's
entry in the parent is enumerated (either in userland or
in kernelland), then you get far less seeking as it all
comes 'up front' and the seeks can be monotonic. However,
still the closer the directories are, the better.
But more to the point, if your directories tend to be cached
this way, you surely win by having the directories allocated
the same way as files (i.e. to be packed /all/ close together).
