Yes. Synchronous RPC calls should never be run by rpciod.
This is a known problem, and I'm working on a fix. I've already got
working code for nfs4_do_close(), but a similar scheme has be set up for
the byte range locking code.
At the moment I'm busy with my move from Norway to the US, so please
give me a week or 2 to get back to you on this one.
Cheers,
