Yes, it wasn't a good comment. Basically we can't hold the page lock and
then enter the page fault handler. mm-fix-pagecache-write-deadlocks.patch
has quite a lot of comments to explain it.
I don't believe filemap_xip holds the page lock, so you don't need to do
the atomic copy, and you don't need to do the fault_in_pages_readable.
