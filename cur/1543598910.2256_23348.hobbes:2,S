There has already been **much** discussion about this, but I think
that the bottom line is that the new version is safer and more
robust than the old version, and thus is not likely to be changed
back.
Consider what happens if someone writes min(++x,y) - the old
version expands to (without some of the extra parens):
	++x < y ? ++x : y
which will increment x twice if the condition ++x < y is true.
There's all kinds of nasty side effects possible with the old
version, including having x > y at the end of the statement, which
definitely violates the semantics of min().
The new version avoids these side effects by only evaluating
the given arguments once (assigning them to temp variables,
which will be optimized away in almost all cases anyway), but
in order to do that, the macro needs to know the variable type,
hence the additional argument. In C++, this can be done using
typename or templates, but the kernel's not written in C++
for a number of very good reasons.
Bottom line, I think the new version of min() and friends is
here to stay and is definitely a positive move. One of the down
sides to that is that a lot of people have a lot of cleaning
up to do.
