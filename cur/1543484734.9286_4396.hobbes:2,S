    It means that either you've got a struct file leak or something is playing
    bad games with filp->private_data. In theory it may be any other subsystem
    using the same field. IIRC tty code more or less blindly assumes that
    meaningful value in private_data means that we have a tty-related struct
    file. Potential candidates: AFFS, CODA(?), drivers/net/cosa.c(?), ISDN,
    APM(?), MTRR(?). Do you have any of those beasts?
Five years ago we saw precisely the same messages,
long before any of your candidates existed as part of a default kernel.
Sounds like a flaw in the tty code.
I do not know whether it is harmless, but it happens occasionally.
