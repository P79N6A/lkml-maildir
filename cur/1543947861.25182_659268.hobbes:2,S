It must first go into the 2.6.25 tree and then into -stable.
And the patch must be considered to do The Right Thing (tm).

Heh, wait. Larry is neither the bcm43xx maintainer [1], nor does this
code touch bcm43xx code. It does touch ssb and b43 code, which I
am the maintainer of.
Though, as I said, if somebody else is familiar with the code does really
understand the patch and does ACK it (which Larry did), I'm probably
OK with applying it. As long as I'm not bothered with any followup
regressions caused by this. So if the one signing off the patch will
handle all this, I'm fine with it.
[1] bcm43xx is unmaintained. Larry used to be the maintainer until
he dropped it a few months ago.
