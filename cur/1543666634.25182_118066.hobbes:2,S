ps. The 2.5 kallsyms code is incompatible with modutils 2.4,
backporting the incomplete 2.5 kallsyms would only get debugging
symbols for the kernel, not for modules.  Changing modutils 2.4 is not
an option, I will not introduce an incompatible change in the middle of
a stable kernel series unless there is no choice (e.g. to fix a
critical bug).
