Hi,
I'm looking for a driver, or a person who write driver for the $subject,
because my friend has this type and Hi wants to get work with his
favourite OS. I've searched all the net to a contact person who can help
me about the description of this modem, but nothing found.
I'm not sure i could write this driver 'cause i've never wrote drivers
before, and i've never used any ISDN modems, so i've no idea how i can
help him.
Thank You
TiTaNiC
