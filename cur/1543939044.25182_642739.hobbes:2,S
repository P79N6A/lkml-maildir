Ah, my non-existent knowledge of Hungarian wasn't up to interpreting

It should be secure if done properly.  Of course, if you set the 
"poweroff" executable to something untrustworthy then you'll have a 
problem, but there's no inherent security problem there.  And if you 
want to do an orderly shutdown, you need to have some amount of help 
from the userspace side of things, and invoking a command is the normal 
way to do this.
