Fast and clear! Thank you so much.
Just a last question: The conversion function, should I code it as a
"exported function" via ioctl (copying the boolean matrix to kernel
space, converting it and sending it back to user space), or as a
second special device (like /dev/cfag..matrix)?
Because of the problems I explained of waiting for all the matrix to
start converting and sending it, I think the first option is better:
The user-space program can ask for the conversion via ioctl and then
send it to the normal device it whenever it wants.
