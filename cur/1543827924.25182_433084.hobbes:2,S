Hi Erik,
(1) Yes layout was just like you have mentioned, yet I put user names so 
that it is easy read in the e-mail
-Why do you want to tell the load per user? Just the CPU and disk load
-should be sufficient.
This is the answer:
The reason for the division of load signal along the "user lines" is that 
in the Grid computing the users submit jobs separately.
Therefore if we are to collect a historical data of a particular user, then 
we have to collect it separately free from system/root load.
In a grid, which is implemented through Globus, a user will have to 
register himself with the provider and needs to be allocated a separate 
login account. Thus the user is only allowed to submit his HPC jobs to this 
particular account. Therefore if we can measure the load under that 
particular user-login, such collection of historical load profiles could 
show very high epochal behavior, which is related to the user's operational 
habits. This fact further emphasizes the importance of the Division of the 
load signal.
After applying the Division of load at the kernel level, we have developed 
a Prediction model called "Free load profile model for load and run time 
prediction"
Erik our load prediction system has given very good results as well.
(2) Now about the tests
As I have documented all this yet need to perform some standard tests for 
the sake of completion.
What tests should I carry out to prove that the system is still intact?
Please tell me whether the below is correct?
(a) As suggested by the 
http://kernel-perf.sourceforge.net/
 the lmbench and 
re-aim-7 test packages can be used to test the performance of the kernel 
before making changes and after. (Not done as yet)
(b) Further tests have been carried out to check the response time of short 
tasks before making changes and after making changes. The results indicated 
that there was no difference in the response time after introducing the 
changes to the kernel (done)
(c) Thereafter the tests have been carried out to check the runtime of long 
tasks before and after making changes. The results of the tests revealed 
that there is no change in reported runtime in both occasions.(done)
Thanks
