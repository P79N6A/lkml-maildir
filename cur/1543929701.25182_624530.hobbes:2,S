BTW, note that it would be a polite thing for GnuTLS when it is
encrpyting data, which represents information which might not be
available to an adversary, and SHA1 hash it (out of paranoia) and feed
it to /dev/random.  
This won't give any "credits" to the random entropy counter, but to
the extent that is information that isn't available to the adversary,
it adds additional uncertainty to the random pool.
