Kernel process/thread has access to all hardware capability. No security can 
be envorced.
User process is limited to the memory the kernel allocates to the process. No
direct device access, no access to all system resources. All hardware access
is mediated by the kernel. Some privileged operations can be delegated to a
user process (see X server running without frame buffer support).
