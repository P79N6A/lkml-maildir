2.3.
PCI 2.2 defines bits 0-9 only (bit 7 = Stepping Control)
PCI 2.3 and 3.0: bit 7 = Reserved, bit 10 = Interrupt Disable.
OTOH many devices have "interrupt disable" bit somewhere else, in
their specific PCI config registers or in regular config registers
(accessible with normal Memory Read/Write cycles).
MSI was first defined in PCI 2.2.
Perhaps I can check NV (MCP55) for that problem with a module claiming
all free interrupts. Tomorrow maybe.
