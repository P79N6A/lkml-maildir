My personal opinion
Sound is mainly integrated on boards. Since developing a high end card is not 
an easy job, and the market is pretty small for that (enough competition), I 
think the wireless card is not too weird to do
Plus wireless is hot. What we can do is implement the standard and add a 
little extra once we are done with that, linux a nice encryption layer for 
linux to linux communication, thus giving linux (or a windowsbox with the 
right drivers), a nice edge.
