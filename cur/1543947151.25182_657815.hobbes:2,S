Subject: [PATCH 2.6.25-rc2 7/9] Kconfig: Improve init/Kconfig help descriptions - EMBEDDED etc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/21/476

Rewrite the help descriptions for clarity, accuracy and consistency.
Kernel config options affected:
  - EMBEDDED
  - SYSCTL_SYSCALL
  - KALLSYMS
  - KALLSYMS_ALL
  - KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS
  - HOTPLUG
  - PRINTK
  - BUG
  - ELF_CORE
  - BASE_FULL
  - FUTEX
  - EPOLL
  - SIGNALFD
  - TIMERFD
  - EVENTFD
