Nope, yield is terribly bad when there are busy processes running: it can
stall for a very long time indeed,
Is this hardware not capable of generating an interrupt when BUSBUSY gets

I guess not, in which case you're stuck with having to poll it - probably
use a cond_resched() in the loop, and an angry comment.
