Sorry it took a few days...
So I'm testing throughput for the full pagecache lifecycle, insertion
to reclaim. Reading from a sparse file much bigger than memory.
On my 2 socket, 8 core Opteron setup:
Single dd from a single file:
vanilla:  687.01MB/s
patched: 1037.17MB/s (151%)
8 dds from a single file:
vanilla: 1458.04MB/s
patched: 5898.65MB/s (405%)
Not sure how well that translates to real world workloads, but it
might help somewhere. Admittedly some of the patches are pretty
complex...
Anyway, have a good christmas and new year :)
Thanks,
Nick
