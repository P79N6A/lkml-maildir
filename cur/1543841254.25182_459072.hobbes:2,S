>The new implementation considers the full menu of available c-states.
>Just as the previous implementation, decisions are primarily based on
>the residency time of the last c-state entry.  This is generally an
>effective metric because it allows for detection of interrupt activity.
>However, the new algorithm differs in that it does not promote 
>or demote
>through the c-states in succession.  Rather, it immediately jumps to
>whatever c-state has the best expected power consumption advantage for
>the predicted residency time (i.e. the previously measured residency).
>If the residency time is too short during a deep c-state 
>entry, then the
>cost of entering the state outweighs any power consumption advantage.
>Similarly, if a shallow c-state is entered and resident for an
>excessively long duration, then a potential opportunity to save more
>power is missed.

>The bus master activity mechanism has undergone similar improvements.

Nice changes. Will test and let you know how it goes.
While we are at cleaning up the code, I think it will be much better to 
move out C-state policy out of this acpi code altogether. We should have
just a generic interface, where any low level driver (acpi) can 
register/unregister a idle routine with latency, power and other 
characteristics (BM_STS). That way the policy can be generic and 
out of ACPI code. We had a patch earlier that does something like this
here:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org/msg00129.html
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org/msg00130.html
But, that did not go anywhere at that time. Probably we can do some 
cleanup like that, along with this patch....
Thanks,
Venki
