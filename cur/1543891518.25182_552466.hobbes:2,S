No, the camera is fast when I use acpi=force and pci=routeirq.
It does not matter which USB port I use. I am attaching
the dmesg output with acpi=force and pci=routeirq appended to
the kernel command line.

Originally I have been using the USB ports on the front panel of
the computer. I had not tested the USB ports on the rear panel
of the computer. I have just tested the USB ports on the rear
panel of the computer with acpi=ht, and surprise, the camera is fast!
From this we learn that the problematic ports are on the front
panel whereas the "always-working" ports are on the rear panel.
The problematic ports work when acpi=force is appended to the
kernel command line.

I would prefer to patch the kernel to prevent IO-APIC when
ACPI is not enabled by using the "acpi_disabled" variable.
But since you are the kernel developer among you and I,
I guess you should have the right choose what the best
option is.
> In fact, I thought that patch already existed in the -mm tree?
Yes, I had made an attempt to get it out of the blacklist a
couple of weeks ago. The patch is in the -mm tree. Could we
please get that patch into the main tree?

As I said above, with acpi=ht, the camera works
fine when connected to the USB port on the back
side of the computer. (Not the ports on the front
side.)
Thank you for spending time on this problem.
I really appreciate your efforts.
