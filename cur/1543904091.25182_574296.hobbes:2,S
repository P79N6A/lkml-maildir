Can we at least assume the submitter is sane in some ways?
i and j are picked for obvious iterater values - you would not want
verbosify that to fruit_iterator and process_iterator or whatever
because it's a hell lot more typing.
It takes more than a few Perl regexes to actually grasp the semantics
of whether "i" is useful or not.
