By the way -- I notice you have said you need i2c_get_client for your
RTC driver to locate the i2c chip it wants to work with. 
Just a thought -- perhaps it would make sense to reverse the roles and
for the rtc driver to export a 'register_rtc_device' type call which the
specific i2c chip driver could then call to hook itself up to /dev/rtc
