   I've been known to be silly now and then, for sure.  Apple says
this about the next version of OS X, due next year:
"Tiger provides a standard, Darwin-level API for managing resource
forks, filesystem metadata, security information, properties and other
attributes in a consistent, cross-platform manner. For example, common
UNIX utilities such as cp, tar and rsync can properly handle HFS+
resource forks."
    That's marketing copy, but I think it's worth noting.  It seems to
be that resource forks aren't deprecated across the board,
just... changed.
    Apple has found a way to make this work, at least partially.  I
don't know if it's a good way, but there it is.
    I'd like to be able to keep my Macintosh stuff on my Linux
fileserver, without losing the resource forks.  That would require
that the network fs support it of course, and whether I could use tar
to back up my linux box would depend on how streams might be
implemented there.

    Can't we have both?
