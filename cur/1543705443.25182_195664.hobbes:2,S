This is what free reports after the build
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        516396     215328     301068          0      85084      68364

then after starting 10 instances of the above program
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

and then after those programs finish
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

It looks OK to me.

Yes, it is.

Not much difference, these are times for a build straight after a
reboot:
2.6.
246.22user 120.44system 3:34.26elapsed 171%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (468major+3769185minor)pagefaults 0swaps
2.6.1 elevator=deadline
245.61user 120.31system 3:39.29elapsed 166%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (463major+3770456minor)pagefaults 0swaps
I note that the number of major pagefaults is not zero, I did not spot
that before.  In the past I have concentrated on builds when the
system has been running for some time, often having already built the
software one or more times, and in those cases the number of major
pagefaults was always zero, typically
2.6.1

0inputs+0outputs (0major+3763670minor)pagefaults 0swaps
When running 2.4 the total number of pagefaults is about the same, but
they are split over major and minor
2.4.24
242.27user 81.06system 2:44.18elapsed 196%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
