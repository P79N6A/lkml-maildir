Sure. I helped develop a Kalman Filter that would run in real-time.
It was first implemented in Matlab (which is awful to interpret).
I rewrote it in ix86 assembly, using synthetic division (where you
save the remainder and use it in a subsequent division for the same
element in the polynomial). The result being that the filter generates
no error even though it performs multiple divisions of non-integral
numbers.
These techniques are great for continuous functions. Early filtering
techniques, using classical methods (average, r.m.s, r.s.s, etc.)
develop a bias because of round-off. The synthetic division bounds
the bias to one less than the last divisor.
If you filter enough stuff, over a long enough time, you can make
gold out of shit. The onboard GPS software has a very long time
to tune. Its a good candidate. In principle, the ground standard
doesn't have to be very good as long as it averages correctly
with low residual bias.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
