Rusty's plan to standardize boot and module parameters needs the
overall "module name" in the code, whether the code is built in or a
module.  KBUILD_MODNAME defines the overall module name based on the
linkage data.
Sometimes KBUILD_MODNAME is used quoted, sometimes it is used unquoted.
We can quote it easily (__stringify) but AFAIK there is no way in cpp
to strip quotes from a string, so KBUILD_MODNAME has to be passed as a
bare word, without quotes.
af_unix.c is linked into unix.o so we have -DKBUILD_MODNAME=unix.  Alas
we also have -Dunix=1.  __stringify(KBUILD_MODNAME) -> __stringify(unix) ->
"1" instead of "unix".
