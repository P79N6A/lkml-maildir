Wait a second, I thought proc was here to stay.  Wait another
second, device nodes are already magic.  Magic is magic, just
choose your color ;-)
This set of magic dirs is supposed to clean things up, not mess things 
up.  We already saw how the side-effects-on-open problem in ls -l goes 
away.  There's a much bigger problem I'd love to deal with: the 'no 
heirarchy can please everybody' problem.  In database terms, aheirarchy 
is an insufficiently general model for real-world problems, in other 
words, they never worked.  Tables work.  That's where I'm trying to go 
with this, so please bear with me.  This is not just a solution in 
search of a problem.

Well, actually no, ls -R, tar, zip, etc, work pretty well with the 
scheme I've described.

No, no, no, agreed and sometimes magic is good.  It's not deep magic.  
The only new thing here is the interpretation of the O_DIRECTORY flag, 
or rather, the lack of it.

Thanks, two good points:
  - libc5 will get confused when doing ls in /magicdev
  - POSIX specifically forbids this
I'll put this away until I've specifically dug into both of them.  OK, 
over and out, thanks for your commentary.
/me peruses man pages
Oops, oh wait, there's already another open point: your breakage 
examples both rely on opening ".".  You're right, "." should always be 
a directory and I believe that's enforced by the VFS.  So we don't have 
an example of breakage yet.
