Hmm, this may be a kernel bug also, in a way.  I don't know if ext2
allows you to set attributes on char/block special files, but if it
does, then the "immutable" attribute should _probably_ apply to
changing the device inode, rather than writing to the device itself.
In any case, it is also a bad thing to leave garbage in unused parts of
on-disk data structs for just this reason, so mkreiserfs should zero
everything that is unused inside allocated structs (and the kernel too,
because reiserfs allocates inode tables dynamically, right?).
Cheers, Andreas
