I had another look at my config as well after finding that the problem 
seems to have gone away with a rebuild
I hadn't configured any D chanel protocols (looking back I can see
"HiSax: protocol euro not supported" messages in my logs but I must
have been smoking something because I missed them even though they
were staring me in the face.
Even though I think it was probably my fault I'm a bit dubious that a
missed configuration option should hang the kernel so easily. Perhaps
the isdn code could be made to refuse to compile if the choices aren't 
"sensible"
