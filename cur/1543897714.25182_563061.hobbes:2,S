hm, i agree with you that this is problematic. Especially on an SMT CPU 
it would be a big architectural restriction if prefetches couldnt cross 
cache misses. (and that's the only way i could see Nick's scheme 
working: MESI coherency coupled with the speculative use of that 
cacheline's value never "surviving" a MESI invalidation of that 
cacheline. That would guarantee that once we have the lock, any 
speculative result is fully coherent and no other CPU has modified it.)
