well, if/when there's a concensus i'll do the type checking change in a
'second wave' patch, since it's a distinct issue not directly connected to
the naming cleanup.
there are some more IRQ subsystem cleanups for which i have patches: such
as the removal of the pt_regs parameter from the irq handler function,
it's unused in 99% of the drivers - and the remaining 1% can get at it via
other means.
