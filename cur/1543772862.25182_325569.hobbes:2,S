You're right, we need to serialize access to 0x43, since it selects
which of the timers will be accessed next. I had to refresh my memory on
how that piece of hardware works.
Regarding 0x61, it's rarely used elsewhere (in MCA case, and for NMI
traps). We may need to modify the other code, but I doubt there is much
worth in it. Anyway, we do a read-modify-write, so locking would be
appropriate.
So I agree with that part of the patch.

Indeed, input_grab() doesn't work on events _to_ the device. And
unfortunately, it probably can't be made to work, since there is no way
to figure out in input_event() which handler it was called from.
It might be desirable to separate the in/out paths in the input layer in
the future.
So indeed, you can't use it.

I don't have a problem with the naming, but indeed the concept. The
SND_* events are for generating sounds, SND_SUSPEND (or _STOP) would be
for enabling/disabling the driver. If anything, it would fall into the
EV_SYN class, but still that doesn't seem like a clean solution.
I don't want to pollute the input API with ad hoc stuff like that.
I think that it'd be best, if you need to share the PC-speaker hardware
with a different driver, to just provide an interface between the two
drivers that doesn't go through the input subsystem.
