Ah that's true -- i missed that indeed. I don't actually 
remember why it was hardcoded like this on x86-64. I don't think
there is a good reason for it and if there's a bit for this
in the CMOS it ought be better checked.

In theory it would make sense with the followup change to
do the extended century on 32bit too, but in practice all these
systems should be BCD anyways (I hope)
