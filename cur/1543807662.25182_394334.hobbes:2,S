Subject: Broken NFS (perhaps Cache invalidation bug ?)

I have a problem which appears to be very similar to a cache invalidation 
bug previously reported: 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0510.1/0582.html
With a conventional nfs mount (not automount), c0-0 a client node, 
running on the nfs server:
echo 10 > Probe
ssh -x c0-0 cat Probe
echo 11 > Probe
ssh -x c0-0 cat Probe
Will give, most times, 10 & 10 rather than 10 & 11.
I've tried a wide range of things (including consulting local experts), 
so far nothing. I'm not a kernel developer, so please be gentle. This 
problem has occurred ever since we moved to the 4.X releases of rocks 
(
http://www.rocksclusters.org
), X=0 or 1 although it's hidden by their 
default use of automounting and it's taken some time to reduce it to 
something simple.
