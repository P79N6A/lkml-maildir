Oh so you need cache coherency to make it a machine.  That being the only
difference between that and a NUMA box.
Although I will state that there is a lot more that goes into such
a system than a network, and a library.  At least there is a lot more
that goes into the manageable version of one.

Oh wait none of that comes with cache coherency.  So the difference
cannot be cache coherency.

Cool so the SGI Ultrix is not a machine.  Nor is the SMP box over in
my lab.  They are separate machines wired together with a network, and
so I better start calling them a network of machines.
As far as I can tell which pile of hardware to call a machine
is a difference that makes no difference.  Marketing as you put it.
The only practical difference would seem to be what kind of problems
you think are worth solving for a collection of hardware.  By calling
it a single machine I am saying I think it is worth solving the single
system image problem.  By refusing to call it a machine you seem to
think it is a class of hardware which is not worth paying attention to.
I do think it is a class of hardware that is worth solving the hard
problems for.  And I will continue to call that pile of hardware a
machine until I give up on that. 
I admit the hard problems have not yet been solved but the solutions
are coming.
