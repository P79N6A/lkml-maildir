Try the one-liner against ialloc.c.  You'll need to rebuild
each filesystem to remove the inter-file fragmentation which
ext2 put in there though.
Fortunately I made all the partitions on my laptop the same size,
and there is a spare one.  So I'm busily doing a `cp -a' of each
filesystem onto a newly created one, then mke2fs -j'ing the old one,
then moving on to the next one.  It's boring.
All the other changes make basically no difference once the ialloc.c
change is made.  With that workload.  It's all a matter of utilisation
of device-level readahead.
