I've posted a bugfix update for 2.4.21-ck1 that includes a fix for the long 
standing interactivity bug that I've been battling with. This patch reverts 
timeslices back to normal length as well. It makes a massive difference to 
system responsiveness under very heavy load, and eliminates audio skips in my 
testing. I highly recommend anyone using any -ck patchset up to 2.4.21-ck1 to 
update.
