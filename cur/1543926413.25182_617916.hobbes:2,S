Subject: [PATCH] [CIFS] fix potential data corruption when there are errors writing out dirty pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/15/220

The idea here is separate "conscious" from "unconscious" flushes.
Conscious flushes are those due to a fsync() or close(). Unconscious
ones are flushes that occur as a side effect of some other operation or
due to memory pressure.
Currently, when an error occurs during an unconscious flush (ENOSPC or
EIO), we toss out the page and don't preserve that error to report to
the user when a conscious flush occurs. If after the unconscious flush,
there are no more dirty pages for the inode, the conscious flush will
simply return success even though there were previous errors when writing
out pages. This can lead to data corruption.
The easiest way to reproduce this is to mount up a CIFS share that's
very close to being full or where the user is very close to quota. mv
a file to the share that's slightly larger than the quota allows. The
writes will all succeed (since they go to pagecache). The mv will do a
setattr to set the new file's attributes. This calls filemap_write_and_wait,
which will return an error since all of the pages can't be written out.
Then later, when the flush and release ops occur, there are no more
dirty pages in pagecache for the file and those operations return 0. mv
then assumes that the file was written out correctly and deletes the
original.
CIFS already has a write_behind_rc variable where it stores the results
from earlier flushes, but that value is only reported in cifs_close.
Since the VFS ignores the return value from the release operation, this
isn't helpful. We should be reporting this error during the flush
operation.
This patch does the following:
1) changes cifs_flush and cifs_fsync to use filemap_write_and_wait and
to check its return code. If it returns successful, they then check the
value of write_behind_rc to see if an earlier flush had reported any
errors. If so, they return that error and clear write_behind_rc.
2) sets write_behind_rc in a few other places where pages are written
out as a side effect of other operations and the code waits on them.
3) changes cifs_setattr to only call filemap_write_and_wait for
ATTR_SIZE changes.
4) makes cifs_writepages accurately distinguish between EIO and ENOSPC
errors when writing out pages.
Some simple testing indicates that the patch works as expected and that
it fixes the reproducer for the known problem.
