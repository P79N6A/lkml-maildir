Subject: kernel 2.6: can't get 3c575/PCMCIA working - other PCMCIA card work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I have an ancient laptop with a yenta_socket PCMCIA bridge and three
cards, each with Hinds' pcmcia-cs driver indicated:
  Orinico Wireless LAN (wvlan_cs)
  3COM 3c575 (3c575_cs)
  Psion Gold Card Modem (serial_cs)
I have compiled a 2.6.0 kernel with the following relevant options:
  CONFIG_PCMCIA=y
  CONFIG_YENTA=y
  CONFIG_CARDBUS=y
  CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI=y
  CONFIG_PCMCIA_HERMES=m
  CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA=y
  CONFIG_PCMCIA_3C574=m
  CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=m
  CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CS=y
Furthermore, I installed the following relevant software packages:
ii  pcmcia-cs      3.2.5-2        PCMCIA Card Services for Linux
ii  hotplug        0.0.20031013-2 Linux Hotplug Scripts
I can get the Orinico card working just fine, and the modem is also
detected perfectly. However, the 3c575 card won't be recognised. All
I get from the hotplug system is:
  pci.agent: ... no modules for PCI slot 0000:06:00.0
and that's whether I put "3c574_cs" into the $DRIVERS list of
/etc/hotplug/pci.agent  or not.
What's going on? Is the 3c575 not supported by 3c574_cs? Is there
any way to get this card working?
Thanks,
