No.  The behavior in Linux recently, and arbitrarily (IMO) changed:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111502547506310&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111755426027086&w=2
One of the developers of the file leases mechanism seems to have 
agreed that this change should not have occurred:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111512619520116&w=2
but the suggested patch did not (yet) make its way into the kernel.
Stephen -- what is your take on this now?
Cheers,
Michael
