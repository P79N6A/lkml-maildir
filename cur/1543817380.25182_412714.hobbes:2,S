For what its worth, these back/frontlight controllers are normally PWM
driven so the LED is always at full brightness and just the percentage
of time its turned on varies. These numbers in the driver control the
duty cycle of the PWM.
The original code for corgi/spitz only had a limited number of values
and I exposed the whole range into userspace. I doubt you can damage the
hardware with the different values. There are probably optimal points
for power consumption which is perhaps why Sharp limited the values
exposed. My view is that its up to userspace to limit the values for
optimal power consumption :).

This makes sense as on corgi/spitz there is also this magic bit to set
for the second level of brightness settings...
I'll have a look at these patches and perhaps combine/convert them to
the replacement backlight interface, then we can submit them to Antonino
Daplas/Andrew so all the backlight patches are in one place (currently
-mm).
Given what I've said above, would you be happy to expose the full range
of values to userspace?
