just curious, how does this work through 'su'? Does su check
logincap.conf too?
I certainly agree this can be fully solved in userspace, though it won't
be a few linear change in userspace and for the short term matter
there's not much time left to change userspace. For the long term if we
want to go with the userspace solution that's fine with me, I definitely
agree with that.  For the very short term I'm not sure, but then I
certainly cannot object if nothing is changed in the mainline kernel for
this.
