Evgeniy,
Thanks for your continued work on DST.  I'd like to know if you've
thought further about how synchronous mirroring would be best
implemented with DST.
You shared you views some time ago via comments on your blog:
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/blog/devel/dst/2007_11_05.html
At that time you were saying you'd add a sync bit to the request
structure that is sent to remote nodes.  I'd imagine this would also
require ordering of the block io, no?  Is order guaranteed when the
requests are submitted over the DST protocol?  Otherwise how can you
ensure a valid remote mirror (in the case of network disconnects,
etc)?
Guaranteeing consistent data on all members of a mirror is important.
The main question is: what mechanisms _should_ be used in DST to
provide this consistency?  And do you have a timeframe for when DST
might support such mechanisms for consistent data?
For the purpose of this discussion please assume that the disk cache
is either write-through or battery-backed.
regards,
Mike
