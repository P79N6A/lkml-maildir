Hi!
There's a problem in the include/linux/ixjuser.h file. It uses the
__user macro, but doesn't include the linux/compiler.h file. This
doesn't seem to be a problem for the kernel (I'm guessing since some
other file includes compiler.h), but it makes a difference when
compiling user-space programs that uses ixjuser.h.
Including linux/compiler.h in ixjuser.h solves the problem.
