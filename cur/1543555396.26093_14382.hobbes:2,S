Hi all,
    I've gotten a few emails like the one below since my original post about
seeing the bad slab magic corruption on a Linux server which I had been
running.  From the emails I've gotten this error now spans hardware.  Mine
was an Athlon.  This guy is a K6-2.  The only thing I am not sure of is if
one of those emails mentioned an Intel.  Could something be going on here?
