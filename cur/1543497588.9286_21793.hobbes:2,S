Just as my HiSax ISDN line was automatically hanging up after 240s
of inactivity on kernel 2.3.4:
"alloc_skb called nonatomically from interrupt c0186c0d"
appeared. Here's the nearest symbol:
c0186be8 t rtmsg_fib
I do have CONFIG_RTNETLINK defined in my .config. I'm afraid that I
have no idea what it all means, but thought you might like to know.
The machine continues to work: I'm writing this on it now.
