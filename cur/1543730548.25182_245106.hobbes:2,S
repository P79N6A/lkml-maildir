Yeah that is expected - so I guess it isn't exactly 'harmless' if
performance is critical.

The relevant patch is this one which is now merged into 2.6.

It would be nice if you can test that. It will give GFP_ATOMIC allocators
a larger buffer between starting memory reclaim, and failing their allocations.
However if it is a production system and you can't test patches, Marcelo
pointed out that you should be able to work around the problem by increasing
/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes. Then maybe you could try 2.6.9 with min_free_kbytes
back to its default setting :)
