I had a problem with getting tons of "kernel: svc: bad direction..."
messages.  Web searches resulted in many asked questions but few
answers.  I hope it's OK for me to post an answer in the hope that
it makes it into the archives.
My problem turned out to be a Sun host with a DNS domain name in its
"/etc/defaultdomain" file.  That file is supposed to contain a NIS
domain name.  So, the Sun sat there broadcasting what I assume were
"where are you, NIS server?" requests, which Linux didn't like for
some reason.
