Well, yep, you can view freezer as a head in the sand...

...but the moment you start blocking tasks that done driver request,
you _do_ have mini-freezer of your own, with pretty much the same
problems.
In another message I shown that removing freezer will not help with
FUSE in general case.
It probably does not help with firmware, too; as soon as udev attempts
to do something with your wireless card, it is blocked, and if the
wireless card needs the firmware from udev, you are deadlocked.
