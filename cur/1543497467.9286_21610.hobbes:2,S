Trusted Solaris and SecureWare implementations include this.
The saved set is a process privilege, and of the process privileges 
only the inheritable and effective can be raised and dropped (depending on
whats in the permitted set).  The permitted set can have privileges in it
dropped but not re-raised.  And yes you are correct that the saved set 
cannot be modified by an API, except in the fact that changing effective 
UID changes it (to the empty set).
