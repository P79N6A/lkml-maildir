Subject: NWFS [PATCH] File organization 2.2.18 and 2.4.0-7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Linus,
I at present have the NWFS utilities and File System drivers as single
source base.  Obviously, the way your tree is organized, the file system
driver proper should be in the kernel tree and the file system utitilies
somewhere else.  Where should I breakout the file system utils and where
do these go?  I noticed stuff for ext2 on www.kernel.org in a utils
directory.  Are the utilities something I should submit as a tar.gz and
the driver as a patch, or can I leave the utilities in the source tree
itself.  It's been coded to have dependencies on most of the files that
comprise the driver itself, but obviously, this is probably how someone
who lives on another planet would do it.  I also have a single source
base for all versions of Linux rather than a different file system code
base for each version, which is how you've got it organized today.  This
part I can get around.  What's a little harder is how the utilities
depend on the driver source files.  I can maintain a separate code base
for the Utilities, however, this means I have to maintain two code bases
and keep them in sync if bugs get fixed in one or the other.
Please advise,
Jeff
