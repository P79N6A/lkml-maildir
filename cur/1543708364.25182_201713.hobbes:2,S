   [ACPI] ACPICA 20040211 udpate from Bob Moore
   
   Completed investigation and implementation of the
   call-by-reference mechanism for control method arguments.
   
   Fixed a problem where a store of an object into an indexed
   package could fail if the store occurs within a different
   method than the method that created the package.
   
   Fixed a problem where the ToDecimal operator could return
   incorrect results.
   
   Fixed a problem where the CopyObject operator could fail
   on some of the more obscure objects (e.g., Reference objects.)
   
   Improved the output of the Debug object to display buffer,
   package, and index objects.
   
   Fixed a problem where constructs of the form "RefOf (ArgX)"
   did not return the expected result.
   
   Added permanent ACPI_REPORT_ERROR macros for all instances of the
   ACPI_AML_INTERNAL exception.
