Right; I get to pick between comcast cable, cox cable, and verizon  
dsl, all of which offer that same "feature" along with port 80  
blocking and a host of other invasive features (not to mention the  
hundred ARP "Who has 1.2.3.4?" requests per second).  My college does  
the same SMTP blocking and there is no "alternate ISP" there.
Cheers,
