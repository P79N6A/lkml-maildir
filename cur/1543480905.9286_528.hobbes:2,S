Deer kernel hacker,
I just upgrade my kernel from pre5 to pre8 and
module de4x5 is not longer loaded :(
I have track the problem: the patch of strstr()
in pre8 break gcc-2.7.2.1 :(
As I also have gcc-2.8.1 installed and the file
Changes don't said if I could use it to compile
the kernel, I need:
- a real patch for strstr()
or
- a status about linux-2.2.0-pre8 and gcc-2.8.1
As I am not in the mailing-list [and can't access
to archives since today :(], please send also your
answer to Edouard.Parmelan@France.NCR.COM.
Edouard.
