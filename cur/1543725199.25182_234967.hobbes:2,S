-	  Suspend-to-disk is a power management state in which the contents
-	  of memory are stored on disk and the entire system is shut down or
-	  put into a low-power state (e.g. ACPI S4). When the computer is
-	  turned back on, the stored image is loaded from disk and execution
-	  resumes from where it left off before suspending.
-	  This config option enables the core infrastructure necessary to
-	  perform the suspend and resume transition.
+	This option enables an alternative implementation of Suspend-to-Disk.
+	It is functionally equivalent to Software Suspend, and uses many of
+	the same internal routines. But, it offers a slightly different
+	interface.
-	  Currently, this suspend-to-disk implementation is based on a forked
-	  version of the swsusp code base. As such, it's still experimental,
-	  and still relies on CONFIG_SWAP.

-	  More information can be found in Documentation/power/.
