Of course but its not a generic way of timer acccess and
requires a fastcall for each timer. You still have the problem of
exporting the frequency and the time offsets to user space (those also
need to be kept current in order for one to be able to calculate a timer
value!). The syscall/fastcall API then needs to be extended to allow for a
system call to access each of the individual timers supported.
And how would this be supported from user space? We link in special
libraries to support for cyclone and any other supported timers into
each program? I thought a kernel would provide hardware abstraction?
The current IA64 fastcall timer interface is generic and is bound into the
clock_gettime interface of glibc.
