NAK -- every single one of these patches is wrong.  All you did was make 
the warning go away, while INTRODUCING new lifetime problems.
The ISDN PCI driver obviously continues execution after the setup 
function ends, yet you pci_dev_put() the device at the end of setup.  As 
a result, no reference is held even though we continue using the device.
