Hi,
I need some information about the TCP implementation. I didn't find any 
information in my Linux Kernel book or in any other tutorial about TCP and I 
do not really understand the tcp.c
The kernel should remove SYN packets if it doesn't recive the final ACK. But 
where is that implemented in the Linux Kernel?
example
host                       server
      -----SYN----->    remember SYN
      <----ACK------ 
 host shuts down
                               timeout for the threewayhandshake
                                 removing waiting status
