           Summary: clean-up: unneeded version.h in sound drivers
    Kernel Version: 2.5.66-bk2
            Status: NEW
          Severity: low
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: bwindle-kbt@fint.org
Problem Description:
There appear to be quite a few files in the 2.5.66-bk2 tree, in the sound 
driver area, that #include <linux/version.h>, but do not use any of the
three  things defined in it.
linux/sound/oss/cs46xx.c
linux/sound/oss/emu10k1/audio.c
linux/sound/oss/emu10k1/passthrough.c
linux/sound/oss/emu10k1/mixer.c
linux/sound/oss/emu10k1/main.c
linux/sound/oss/emu10k1/midi.c
linux/sound/oss/cs4281/cs4281m.c
linux/sound/oss/esssolo1.c
linux/sound/oss/ac97_codec.c
linux/sound/oss/ite8172.c
linux/sound/oss/btaudio.c
linux/sound/oss/sonicvibes.c
linux/sound/oss/cmpci.c
linux/sound/oss/msnd_pinnacle.c
linux/sound/oss/nec_vrc5477.c
linux/sound/oss/es1371.c
linux/sound/oss/i810_audio.c
linux/sound/oss/trident.c
linux/sound/oss/maestro.c
linux/sound/oss/es1370.c
linux/sound/core/wrappers.c
linux/sound/core/memory_wrapper.c
linux/sound/core/sgbuf.c
Because of this, if the kernel version changes, but nothing else is
modified,  these file would be forced needless to recompile due to
version.h changing.
Would a patch to remove these unnessary includes be accepted?
