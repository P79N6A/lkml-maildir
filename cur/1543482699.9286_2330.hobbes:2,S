It was fresh on one of my machines.

And I had over 2MB of allocated swap space.
Nothing happened. I might be wrong, but perhaps it's a bug with the RH5.x ldd
from the glibc package? AFAIR many people who reported the crash were using
RH5.x - some of them didn't mention which dist they use, but those who said
they're running Slackware or Debian dists didn't have problems. Perpahs that's
where one should look?
