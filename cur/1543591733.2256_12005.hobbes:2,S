The problem being: very few people actually read the code in drivers/*.
And crap accumulates. The messier it is, the faster it gets shitted.
So relying on the people finding crappy ->write() instances and ridiculing
the authors in public is... well, somewhat naive. There's more than enough
crap already and that simply doesn't happen. It _can_ be done, but it will
take more than just having the code sitting there.
