Because the 2.5.x code doesn't compile on 2.4.x, thus there are version
#ifdefs in my device driver tarballs.  You just don't see that because
some perl magic filteres out the 2.4 code when submitting patches for
2.5.x (and visa versa ...).  If you fetch the tarballs from bytesex.org
you'll see the #ifdefs in the driver code.
