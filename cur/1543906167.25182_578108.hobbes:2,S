An evpfn is an ending _virtual_ pfn right?  A virtual pfn is a vaddr >>
PAGE_SHIFT, right?  We're not calculating anything having to do with
physical addresses.  Having 64-bit physical addresses would be a reason
to use 64-bits as the entry size, but not to round down this "evpfn".
"src" in this case is "*ppos", which is the offset into the file.
Divide that by the entry size (sizeof(unsigned long)) and you get the
number of pages offset into the vaddr space that the user is attempting
to read.  There might be a bug here with it forgetting to offset the
header size, but oh well.
In any case, what _is_ the ((~0UL) >> PAGE_SHIFT)  operation there for?
Is it to make sure that a user reading at the end of the virtual address
space doesn't ask to read 10 pages starting at 0xfffffff0?

Are you working on this actively?  If not, I'd be happy to take whatever
you have and fix it up.  Care to post it, even in a slightly unpolished
state?
