Hi Jamie,
Along these same lines, I was using vmstat to watch vm performance
yesterday with both it and the shell for that console set realtime,
and noticed a large delay when swapping starts.  I also noticed that
the shell was being swapped out.  Should realtime tasks be exempt
from being swapped out?  It seems to me that they should, else it
may take too long for them to run.
