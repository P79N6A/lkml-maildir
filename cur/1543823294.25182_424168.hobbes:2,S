sata_sil, sorry, I thought I provided a good subset of the timeout message:

OK, upon further testing I believe the patch helps out tremendously, I
don't get the timeout message (yet), though I still get a netdev
watchdog. I've gotten this with two different ethernet ports/drivers
so I believe this not to be due to the ethernet driver.
Sample dmesg output:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth2: transmit timed out
The time that it actually takes to happen is variable, though it
hasn't happened to me in under 20 minutes yet.
