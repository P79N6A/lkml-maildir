Subject: mapping of pages out of upper 128MB into kernel address space

Hi,
in a kernel module I have to translate user addresses into kernel addresses. The user uses shared memory allocated with shm_open / ftruncate. This shared memory is allocated somewhere in the upmost 128MB of physical memory that is NOT permanently mapped into the kernel ( found in swapper_pg_dir ). How can I "smp_save" map this memory into the kernel address space ?
Kind regards
Peter Lezoch
