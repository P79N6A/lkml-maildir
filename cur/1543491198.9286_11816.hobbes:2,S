Dear Linus,
I am forwarding my patch to you as it seems that my suspicion that
__volatile__ is needed in get_cycles() of include/asm-i386/timex.h is
justified.
I understand that for the current usage thereof (in
kernel/sched.c/schedule() on SMP only) it may be irrelevant, but since the
macro is there, it is tempting to use it for other purposes (e.g. to
"pseudo-profile" various instruction sequences as per Intel's article on
RDTSC) whereby without __volatile__ one would get wrong numbers.
Regards,
Tigran.
