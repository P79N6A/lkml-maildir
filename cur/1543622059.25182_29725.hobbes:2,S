hmmm.  I can't really remember, but I'm pretty sure it was necessary 
when I started doing this 18 months ago, I wouldn't have added it 
otherwise.
IIRC, "CONSOLE=/dev/tty2" becomes an environment variable for init, and 
with the right intelligence in your startup scripts you get all your rc 
script output on tty2 as well.  On the other hand, my current startup 
scripts don't seem to use it or need it...   so I guess I don't know.
cargo-cult system management :-(   ("but I've always done it that way")
