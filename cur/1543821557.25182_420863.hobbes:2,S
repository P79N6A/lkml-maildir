I have all the interim steps in a private git tree also. I asked for a 
kernel.org account so I could publish the tree. However, if you wish to 
maintain the tree, I can send you my patches so you can recreate the full 
history. The first steps were produced by quilt on the original 
out-of-tree driver, though, so they're probably not helpful.
