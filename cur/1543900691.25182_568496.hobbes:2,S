There's more to it, though.  If devices are suspended, the hibernation kernel
will have to resume them (using platform, like ACPI, callbacks in the process)
instead and that will get complicated.
It's better if devices are quiesced, or even shut down, before we call the
hibernation kernel.

I'm not sure if I agree with that.  In any case, having to use two different
kernels for hibernation would be a big drawback.

Yes, but it will have to know _what_ to save, no?
Plus we need to figure out how to avoid corrupting filesystems and swap in use
by the "old" kernel and its processes (hint: a separate "hibernation partition"
is a no-go).

I think it's most portable to use initrd for that, which already makes things
complicated.  Then, we'll have to load the image and jump to the hibernated
kernel in such a way that it would be able to continue from where it stopped
before.  I don't think that is trivial.

Still, I believe that we should do our best to use only one kernel (meaning one
kernel image) here.
