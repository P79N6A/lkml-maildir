I have had a further 52 of these messages over the last day. No obvious
cause.
Mar 22 13:14:55 haze kernel: ata2: no sense translation for op=0x28
cmd=0x25 status: 0x51
Mar 22 13:14:55 haze kernel: ata2: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete
Error }
Most recently this happened:

no drives were kicked from the array.
