It's great that more attention is being paid to the use of Linux in
embedded systems. And the MAINTAINERS file is probably the right file
to add the above information. But I'm afraid that the way the above
information is formatted will cause confusion. As an example, recently
there was a driver added to the Linux kernel for the PCF8575 chip.
This is an I2C chip that is only used in embedded systems. Regarding
driver review, should any such drivers be sent to the I2C mailing
list, the embedded mailing list or both ? The MAINTAINERS file should
be clear on this.
Bart.
