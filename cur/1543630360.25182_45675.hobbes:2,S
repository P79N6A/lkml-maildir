This looks fishy...
static void i810_free_page(drm_device_t *dev, unsigned long page)
{
        struct page * p = virt_to_page(page);
        if(page == 0UL)
                return;
        put_page(p);
        unlock_page(p);
[...]
You get to unlock_page with p = %eax
void unlock_page(struct page *page)
{
        wait_queue_head_t *waitqueue = page_waitqueue(page);
[...]
The question now is... what is going on here???
static void i810_free_page(drm_device_t *dev, unsigned long page <-- )
{
        struct page * p = virt_to_page(page); <--
What exactly is unsigned long page supposed to be? I sure as hell hope its 
an address... if it is, thats a really strange variable naming...
