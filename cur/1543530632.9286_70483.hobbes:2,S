Hi,
I think a collegue of mine mentioned this problem on the list before
but so far we couldn't find a solution for this.
We are using ASUS P5AB motherboards in combination with IDE (not
ATAPI) ZIP drives in our company, which worked great with kernels <
2.3.40. Now we tried to upgrade to a newer kernel and noticed that all
kernels up to 2.3.51 fail booting - they stop with:
hdc: IOMEGA ZIP 100, 96MB w/16kB Cache, CHS=512/12/32
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 <hda5 hda6> 
 hdb: hdb1 < hdb5 hdb6 >
 hdc: hdc: lost interrupt
 hdc: lost interrupt
 [...]
If we use other mainboards, ATAPI drives or just put a ZIP disc into
the drive while booting the same kernel works.
Older kernels eg. 2.3.39 produced this output but continued
nonetheless:
hdc: IOMEGA ZIP 100, 96MB w/16kB Cache, CHS=512/12/32
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 >
 hdb: hdb1 < hdb5 hdb6 >
 hdc:hdc: read_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
 unknown partition table
If you need more info please tell me.
BTW: it doens't make any difference if I use ALI M15x3 chipset support or not.
