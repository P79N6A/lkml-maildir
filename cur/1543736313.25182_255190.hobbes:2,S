Make absolutely very very sure that you are *NOT* using SELinux --
reiserfs and SELinux do NOT get along right now (this is a known
problem). If you try to use the two together, you'll almost certainly
get freezes and oopses.
If you're seeing this type of problem even without SELinux, that's
interesting...
