Why?  It seems a lot cleaner to have all the information in the same
place.  It is highly unfriendly to userspace to have to gather
information in a lot of places, plus it adds race conditions.
It would be another matter if the format that we have now couldn't be
extended, but we need those fields (well, except the two zeros, but who
cares) *anyway*, so we might as well stick to the existing file, and
reduce the total amount of code and clutter.

Maybe I'm not following the uses of your flags well enough to figure out
 if that information can already been deduced.
