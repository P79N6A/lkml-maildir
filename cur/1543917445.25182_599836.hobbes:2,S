what matters is that only items should be displayed that i _can_ fix. 
With v8 i was able to make kernel/sched*.c almost noise-free, but with 
v9 and v10 that's not possible anymore. And the moment the default 
output of the tool cannot be made 'empty', we've lost the biggest 
battle. Seeing the same bogus (or borderline) warnings again and again 
destroys the biggest dynamic that could get people to use this tool more 
often: the gratification of having a 'perfectly clean' file/patch.
And this is not about any particular false positive. I dont mind an 
"advanced mode" non-default opt-in option for the script, if someone is 
interested in borderline or hard to judge warnings too, but these 
default false positives are _lethal_ for a tool like this. (and i made 
this point before.) This is a _fundamental_ thing, and i'm still not 
sure whether you accept and understand that point. This is very basic 
and very important, and this isnt the first (or second) time i raised 
this.
