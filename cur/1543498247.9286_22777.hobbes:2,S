This report refers to the inability to send large amounts (>64k?) of
data through an ISDN syncPPP connection after the machine has been
up for anything between an hour and a day.
Kernel: 2.3.4
The connection blocks, and appears to keep re-sending the wrong
packets to the distant end, in response to re-transmission requests.
Other TCP/IP data continues to work ok over the interface.
I find that unloading the ISDN module (hisax and isdn), then
unloading the ppp module and reloading the whole lot makes it go
away, but not for too long.
This has been around since 2.1.21x. It was mentioned a week or so
ago, and I wondered if anyone had any new thoughts?
My work-around is to re-load everything each time I connect via the
ISDN dial-up to my ISP.
