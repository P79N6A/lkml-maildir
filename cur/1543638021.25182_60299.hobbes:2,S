Does the average user know about code clarity and maintainability?  I
think I see his point.  I've seen what happens when non coders make
decisions as to what features need to go in.  Don't think it happens in
the open source world?  Go look at what most irc nets use for code.
It's why I actively avoid programming for a living.
