Yes.  Other processes can do spin_lock_irq(&ourtask->sighand->siglock);
without holding tasklist_lock.  If someone just did that, they hold
oldsighand->siglock but no newsighand->siglock, and may then be about to
look at ourtask->sighand.  By holding oldsighand->siglock, we ensure that
we can't be colliding with anything like that.

Yes.

NAK from me.
