Before patch for WARN_ON_ONCE we never had risk to get a cache miss for
__warn_once.
After patch we have.
> __warn_once is in cache and there are no more misses.
There is no insuerence that it is in the cache.
Next:
CPU 1Mb cache cache_alignment : 128  => -16% degradation of tbench
CPU 2Mb cache cache_alignment : 128  => -1%  degradation
CPU 4Mb cache cache_alignment : 64  => -70% degradation
An evictees depends from cache size and line size. last is more
essential in considered case.

That's one cache miss.  One.  For the remainder of the benchmark,
__warn_once is in cache and there are no more misses.  That's how caches
work ;)
But it appears this isn't happening.  Why?
