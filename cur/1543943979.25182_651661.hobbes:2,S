Many early computer programmers including myself, while writing
error messages in early software, did not understand that computer
programmers do not make law so we called bad operations "illegal."
Once you are called to testify in a court of law, about some
message your code wrote to the screen just before a factory
burned down, you start to be much more careful about the syntax.
I advise that, regardless of the rewrite of dictionaries and,
in fact, the rewrite of history, whenever possible we use
the correct message syntax. Dictionaries pick up "common usage"
in spite of the fact that it is wrong. See "irregardless" and
other abortions which now exist in the dictionary.
Cheers,
