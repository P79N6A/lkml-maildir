I think keeping it all under arch/ makes more sense.  drivers/input/
makes a lot of sense where we have keyboard controllers that are used
on various architectures with slightly different glue, or different
controllers for the same busses.  IF you have really totally architecture
specific input devices that require intimate arch knowledge it probably
makes more sense to keep them there.
