Subject: *** ANNOUNCEMENT *** LVM 0.8final driver included in 2.3.47
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Logical Volume Driver 0.8final has been included in Linux 2.3.47.
Thanks to Linus and to hundreds on the Web who helped to achive this!
Nevertheless some problems compiling 2.3.47 with LVM enabled arised
because some parts of the patch got lost during inclusion 8.{(
You'll find the necessary patch to fix this at
<
ftp://linux.msede.com/lvm/v0.8final/patch-2.3.47-lvm-2>.
The version 0.8final of the user space library and tools can be found at
<
ftp://linux.msede.com/lvm/v0.8final/lvm_0.8final.tar.gz>
 as well.
New features are:
   - support for multiple snapshot logical volumes per original
     logical volume to for eg. enable consistent online backups
     or recovery in filesystems and database systems.
   - sizes for eg. with lvcreate can be entered in fractions now
   - all errors now in plain text rather than numeric
   - variable VGDA backup history depth in /etc/lvmconf supported
     by environment variable LVM_VG_MAX_BACKUPS (see vgcreate(8) and others)
   - automatic backup can be suppressed by environment variable
     LVM_AUTOBACKUP (see vgcreate(8) and others) during bulk creates.
     (the possibility to use option "-A n" with all
      changing commands still exists)
   - enhanced debug tracing (Option -d of the tools) to show call depth
