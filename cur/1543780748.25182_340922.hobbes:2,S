Hello David,
you will have no luck. I also have this Mainboard in my test rig.
1.) The Super/IO Winbond W83627EHG-A is not supported yet by lm_sensors2 
or any driver I know of.
2.) I also can't get acpi temperature on Gigabyte 955X Royal and 925Xe 
Mobo, Abit 925XE, ASUS P5AD2-E 925XE, P5WD2 955X too.
The ASUS P5WD2 also has some **EXECUTABLE CODE*** in ACPI Table that 
cause some errors here..regarding ACPI stuff *sigh*
But on the Gigabyte they use a IT8212F Super IO so you can use lm_sensors2.
I hope I could help a bit.
