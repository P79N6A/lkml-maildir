Just check if they apply to current BK tree, in general it's just best
to do patches against latest -rc1-bkX (or just the bk tree, if you use
that).
But the patch looks good, the bio_set approach is the cleanest way to
fix it I think. It will be easy to fix the bounce deadlock as well, by
adding a bio_set_bounce to mm/highmem.c as well.
Thanks for doing this! I'll review the patch in detail, the concept and
solution is definitely good though.
