Subject: sc3200 cpu + apm module kernel crash

Hi,
I am currently trying to setup a fully functionnal linux on a Tatung
webpad (shipped with winCE), which has a AMD/NSC SC3200 CPU (more
details on my blog here: 
http://www.geek-fr.com
 ). So far everything
goes fine except one thing:
when I try to load the APM module, the kernel crashes. I have tried
different options, but always got the same crash. I have enabled some
verbosing and finally found that the crash is happening in
arch/i386/kernel/apm.c in function static void apm_mainloop(void) when
calling apm_event_handler();
I have thrown a bunch of  "printk(KERN_INFO "apm: I am here\n");" and
noticed the crash is happening just when calling apm_event_handler();
and does not even execute any instruction in this function... This is
the point I don't understand, how can it crash just on calling a
function and not executing the first statement in this function?
Moreover by enabling soft lockup detection I have managed to get those
informations:
==========================
apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x07 (Driver version 1.16ac)
apm: entry f000:51c8 cseg16 f000 dseg 40 cseg len ffff, dseg ken ffff
cseg16 len ffff
apm: Connection version 1.2
apm: AC on line, battery statys high, battery life 100%
apm: battery flag 0x01, battery life unknown
BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!

Any idea on what can be happening here?
