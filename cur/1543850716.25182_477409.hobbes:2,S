The issue was that I had a device_driver on the platform bus.
In a git bisect this error somehow didn't show up until
[386415d88b1ae50304f9c61aa3e0db082fa90428] PM: platform_bus and
late_suspend/early_resume
After turning the offending device_driver into a platform_driver,
everything works as expected.
