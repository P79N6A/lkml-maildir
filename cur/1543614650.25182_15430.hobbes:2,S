Humm, wouldn't it be the case to update MAINTAINERS? Or having something
like another file INTERESTED or other better name with addresses of the
right person/mailing list to send patches to?
But I like the idea of a web interface so that people interested in
specific drivers/files could register and receive it when patches are
submitted, maybe this can be coupled with the patchbot idea, that would
lookup this database (plain text file, don't worry) and send the message to
the interested people.
/me thinks... I think we have this in our linux distribution buildsystem,
for people to register interest in particular packages, but that may well
be coupled with bugzilla, and that would be too much for this simple
system... ok, I'll look into this with the distro folks here.
