I've been seeing this over the last couple of months, with
(at least) 2.4.28 and newer, and 2.6.9 and newer standard kernels.
But since I dual boot and switch kernels often, I can't point
at any given kernel or kernel series as being the culprit.
How recent was that fix? Maybe I'm seeing the aftereffects of
pre-fix corruption?

Absolutely. I use no xattrs, ACLs, or SELinux at all, and I always
disable those features in my kernels.
