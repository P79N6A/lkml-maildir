IIRC, you said that your proposed system should have one oslet per about 4  
CPUs. And I see many people claiming that current Linux locking is aimed  
at being good with about 4 CPUs.
Maybe I'm dense, but it seems to me that means current Linux locking is  
aimed at exactly the spot where you argue it should be aimed *anyway*.
What am I not seeing?
