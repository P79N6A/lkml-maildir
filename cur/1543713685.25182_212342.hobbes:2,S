Well...
- rtl8169_interrupt() acks all events before rtl8169_tx_interrupt() is called
- the count of descriptors handled in rtl8169_tx_interrupt() is only limited
  by the number of packets submitted for TX at the time rtl8169_tx_interrupt()
  is called
-> if there is a stream of Tx events, it is possible that Tx descriptors are
   processed before the relevant event is notified to the host by the network
   adapter.
