I don't know what BIOS SMM code is, or what you mean by "hardware fun".  But 
the worst audio dropouts I have are "cp file.wav /dev/audio" when I forgot to 
kill cron and updatedb started up.  (This is considerably WORSE than mp3 
playing.)  I take it "cp" is badly written? :)
And a sound card with only 1mS of buffer in it is definitely not useable on 
windoze, the minimum buffer in the cheapest $12 PCI sound card I've seen is 
about 1/4 second (250ms).  (Is this what you mean by "hardware fun"?)  Even 
if the app was taking half that, it's still a > 100ms big gap where the OS 
leaves it hanging before you get a dropout.  (Okay, some of that's watermark 
policy, not sending more data to the card until half the buffer is 
exhausted...)  What sound output device DOESN'T have this much cache?  (You 
mentioned USB speakers in your diary at one point, which seemed to be like 
those old "paralell port cable plus a few resistors equals sound output" 
hacks...)
Now VIDEO is a slightly more interesting problem.  (Or synchronizing audio 
and video by sending really tiny chunks of audio.)  There's no hardware 
buffer there to cover our latency sins.  Then again, dropping frames is 
considered normal in the video world, isn't it? :)
