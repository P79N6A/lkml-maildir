I have never understood the logic behind some of the fixes that seem to go
into the kernel TCP code. Some OS fucks up by either not conforming to
the standards (Sunos was the last one i remember being discussed here) or
by doing something unusual as in this case with the Push -- and a fix
comes around for it in Linux, and it seems OK for it to go into the
kernel. Should these fixes be put on some unofficial patch web page
somewhere like linuxmama.com? Why in hell should i be
running a few extra opcodes per TCP packet (in the fast path of all
places) when i dont talk to Apples? 
cheers,
jamal
