How do I confiure the this kernel to include IP chains support?
Using menuconfig, in the Netfilter Configuration section, checking only
the Ipchains selection means the kernel won't build because it needs
connection tracking support (as far as I can see).  As soon as I add
support for connection tracking however, the Ipchains selection is removed
as a possible choice.
