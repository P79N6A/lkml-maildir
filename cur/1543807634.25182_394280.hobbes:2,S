Yep, that's what I thought too. Read on...

Well, given that the kernel suspend is going to be kept for a while, 
wouldn't it be better if it was feature full? How would the users be at 
a disadvantage if they had better kernel based suspend for a while, 
followed by u-beaut-cooks-cleans-and-washes uswsusp? That's the part I 
don't get...
So, to be direct, let me ask:
Why is it so important to keep an inferior implementation of kernel 
based suspend, when a better one and field tested, exists?
