I also want updates from the dependency back end code, to remove the
phase 5 processing.  The "extract dependency" code runs after each
compile step so there can be multiple updates running in parallel.  My
gut feeling is that it will be faster to have one database server and
all the back ends talk to that server.  Otherwise each compile will
have overhead for lock, open, mmap, update, close, write back, unlock.
A single threading server removes the need for lock/unlock and can sync
the data to disk after n compiles instead of being forced to do it
after every compile.
If your experience says that doing updates from each compile step
without a server process would not be too slow, let me know.
