Why is this a problem?  It's just like someone did a write(), and we'll
invalidate the pagecache on the next direct-io operation.

eek.  truncate_inode_pages() will throw away dirty data.  Very dangerous,
much chin-scratching needed.
It also has security implications: if a user can force this shootdown to
happen against dirty data at the right time (perhaps with multiple
processes) then a subsequent read of that part of the file will yield
uninitialised disk data.
