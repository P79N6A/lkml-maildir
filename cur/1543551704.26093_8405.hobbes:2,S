Anyone who's been following this list for a while will know not to take any 
notice of Dick, especially when he's spouting about the C standards. This 
is probably why there's been no other response yet.
But just for the benefit of newcomers - the C compiler is _not_ free to 
re-order structure members. They must be in order, but may be arbitrarily 
aligned.
