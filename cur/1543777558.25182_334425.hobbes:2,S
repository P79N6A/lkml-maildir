Question for the AMD guys: is there a chance of getting
non-proprietary-bios ACPI tables from AMD directly? I.e. ACPI tables as
needed for power-now etc. could be released under GPL, making inclusion
into linuxbios a bit simpler.  Right now, the only ACPI table's I've seen
all bear "IF I COPY THIS PLEASE SUE ME UNDER THE DMCA" notices :-)
If such tables are available, and I'm just out of touch, I'd be very happy
to hear that; please send me a URL. 
It makes no sense at all to me that ACPI would be copyright anyone, since
they merely describe hardware, and even the OS guys might want to copy
them around from node to node in some cases. But that's the problem right
now.
