Andrew,
Thanks for the info.
5 microseconds is definitly a lot better than the number I got
with QNX.   Mapping the same region twice doesn't help.  Here's
why:	App A call my API() and my api use local variables as 
pointers to the read write region of share memory on stack.
App B has an un-init local variable in stack, it updates that 
pointer and the share memory is corrupted.  It is impossible
to track down exactly who cause the corruption in this case.
