For example? Do you plan on using "syscall strings" instead of
syscall numbers? I would not go for it. Comparing strings takes much
longer than comparing a register-size integer.

Umm, like with Internet addresses, you can't just reserve yourself
one you like. Including MACs on the local ethernet segment. Though
the MAC space is large with 2^48 or more, you can ARP spoof and
hinder the net.
In other words, if the vendor, or you, are going to use a
non-standard 301, you are supposed to run into problems, sooner or
later [Murphy's Law or Finagle's Corollary].
What you probably want is a syscall number range marked for private
use, much like there is for majors in /dev or 10.0.0.0/8 on inet.
