Hi,
The two following bug reports in the GCC GNATS system describe
problems compiling parts of the Linux kernel with gcc 3.0.2:
http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?pr=4529&cmd=view&database=gcc
http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?pr=4059&cmd=view&database=gcc
(Login: guest, PW: guest)
The problem seems to disappear if the -fomit-frame-pointer
flag is not used for compiling the problematic files in the
kernel.
Can anyone with kernel and/or compiler internals knowledge shed 
some light on what the possible problem is in either the
kernel or in gcc, and what the fix to either would be?
Thanks.
