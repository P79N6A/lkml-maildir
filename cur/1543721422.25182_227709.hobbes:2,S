Although I don't want to see another kernel thread added as much as the next 
guy, I think that minimizing the amount of time that irqs are turned off is 
probably a good thing in general.  For example, the patch to allow interrupts 
in spin_lock_irq if the lock is already taken is generally a really good 
thing, because even though reducing lock contention should be a goal, locks 
by their very nature are taken sometimes, and allowing other CPUs to get 
useful work done while they're waiting for it is obviously desirable.

Sure, for some applications, an RTOS is necessary.  But it seems like keeping 
latencies down in Linux is a good thing to do nonetheless.
Can you think of other ways to reduce the length of time that interrupts are 
disabled during cache reaping?  It seems like the cache_reap loop might be a 
candidate for reorganization (though that would probably imply other 
changes).
Thanks,
Jesse
