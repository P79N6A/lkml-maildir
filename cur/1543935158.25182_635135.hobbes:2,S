Thank you for caring this problem.

The resources of PNP device are obtained by calling the _CRS method.
Maybe some resources has been reserved. For example: Some system will
reserve the following resources.
   BIOS-e820: 00000000fec00000 - 00000000fed40000 (reserved)
   BIOS-e820: 00000000fed45000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
So the system will report that some resources can't be reserved.

The error message is harmless. It only tells us that the resource
definition of PNP device exceeds the predefined PNP constant and maybe
there will be potential problem if some important resources can't be
reserved. For example about 90 IOPORT resources are defined in some PNP
device. So it will print the message. Of course it is more appropriate
to change the message level from ERR to DEBUG.

It is more appropriate to use dynamic memory allocation for Pnp device
than to increase the PNP constant bigger. Now Thomas is working on it.
Maybe he will submit the patch very soon.
