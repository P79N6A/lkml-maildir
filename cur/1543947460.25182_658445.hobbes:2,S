Unfortunately, I missed your Bugzilla comment at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10030#c28
Well, in the face of it, I'm considering to remove the code that
acquires device semaphores from the suspend core for now.  Evidently, this
change turns out to be painfully premature.
Also, we have apparent problems with pm_sleep_lock()
being take in device_add() (see
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9874
).
Thanks,
