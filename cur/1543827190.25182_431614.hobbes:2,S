In May 2006 AMD updated their powernow/cool'n'quiet driver for Athlons 64 to 
1.60.1 version. In kernel 2.6.16.20 there is still 1.60.0. I thought you 
would like to know about it and update powernow files in kernel sources. I 
use 1.60.1 now with kernel 2.6.16.20 on Athlon64 3000+ Venice and seems to be 
working well.
