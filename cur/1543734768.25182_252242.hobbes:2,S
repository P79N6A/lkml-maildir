Quoting linux/Documentation/scsi_mid_low_api.txt:
*
*      Unfortunately some applications expect -EINVAL and react badly
*      when -ENOTTY is returned; stick with -EINVAL.
Looks like a documentation fix is needed then.
This is a hardware RAID device, with various graduations of sharing
possible between hardware and software.   It was originally written
pre-libata, and the RAID functionality in particular does not map
well to libata.  Nor do the host-queuing implementation and other features.
Thanks Alan.  I'll address the other points you brought up later.
Cheers
