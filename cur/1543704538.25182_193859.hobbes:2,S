You have the same drive I have.

sata_sil is the libata driver, it doesn't support "hardware" RAID.
Enable CONFIG_BROKEN to compile it, siimage is the generic ATA driver
(and supposedly the safer of the two, but I've had no problems (yet)
with sata_sil).

Try 2.6.2-rc1 using the sata_sil driver, it has a blacklist instead of
punishing all Seagate (and Maxtor) drives, and ST3160023AS is definitely
not blacklisted at all, regardless of chipset revision.  Revision 2 or
newer of the SiI3112 should be fine with all Seagate drives.
warning: your /dev/hdY will become /dev/sdX (probably /dev/sda, in your
case) if you go from the IDE (siimage) driver to a libata (sata_sil)
driver.
