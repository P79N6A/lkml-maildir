No, iocharset is used for user visible filename.
Is the following enough as example?
                     user

No. But multi-byte encodings has some problem on the letter case conversion.

Yes. But I think that we'll need to rewrite the NLS stuff and some
part of filesystems.

NLS_DEFAULT is used by befs, cifs, vfat, isofs, ncpfs, udf.

Yes. Sorry for my bad English.

Yes, but 8.3-alias is stored always even if it's long name.

Ok. Any suggestion?

Yes, but it's very old, is widely used in linux filesystems.
If it changed, old users may be confused instead.

Yes, I'll fix. How about the following?
