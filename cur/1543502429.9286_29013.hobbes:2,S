Hi, in recent threads on various amiga lists, there were made some serious
claims about Linuxes TCP/IP stack. Basically they said that it was worse
then MSes (as far as standards complience) and that it lacked many
important new features, such as QOS, multicast, IPv6 and such..
This struck me as crazy talk, but it's backed up by the author of the
Miami Amiga TCP/IP stack.. But lots of people are saying it now, and I'm
sure that some goofball in the press is going to see and and take it as
the truth..
Can anyone comment on this:
