It _was_ merged later. Con was talking about Andrew's -mm tree.

The scheduler interfaces are probably among the most stable
in the kernel. Con was talking about internal implementation.

It seems there are plenty of people who can do networking code
just fine.

I get the feeling your friend is making up some tall tales if he
says he rewrote the networking code to be much better than it is
now. But I can guarantee him that if he has it will be of great
interest to the network developers.

I'm pretty sure it isn't a scheduler slowdown, but rather the
system is getting disk bound. I think the reporter has
performance back to 2.6.10 levels - it is actually something I
still have to follow up on, but it is difficult because the
reporter isn't able to share his code, although he's otherwise
very helpful.

If slowdowns do get merged, it is generally because they either
haven't been reported until being merged or they make an accepted
tradeoff. Not that they haven't been tested.
Let's just get this straight, no amount of QA other than releasing
a kernel and asking people to use it is going to find all the bugs
that will be encountered.

I mostly agree with you apart from your specific examples I think
we could do things better, and most of us have made some big blunders,
However there is just no way that bringing any of that up will help
Reiser4 being merged.
