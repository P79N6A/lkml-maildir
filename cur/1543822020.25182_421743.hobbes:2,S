Having looked at this several times over the last couple of days, I've
come to the conclusion that I'm not the right person to fix this problem.
I've tried several methods of converting the code, but every time I
remain unconvinced that the changes are provably correct as far as not
missing something, so I end up throwing the changes away and starting
again.
Yes, I admit defeat.
Maybe someone who cares about this stuff[1] (or who sees the problem)
should look into it.

out the sched_clock() issue.
