OK, I've tested this patch but I still can easily make XMMS starve for
briefs periods of time and can also make X to start behaving jerky. If I
put the system under load (while true; do a=2; done) dragging a window
fast enough for a long time makes the X server priority decreases to a
point where the window moving is not smooth and very jerky. If I stop
dragging the window, after a while, the X server prority is restablished
and I can start all over again.
