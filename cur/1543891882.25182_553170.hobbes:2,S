The range "detected" was 0 to 255 but both X and Y axis are reporting 4096.
I think that the code in drivers/hid/hid-input.c:
if ((device->quirks & HID_QUIRK_BADPAD) && (usage->code == ABS_X ||
usage->code == ABS_Y)) {
  a = field->logical_minimum = 0;
  b = field->logical_maximum = 255;
}
should get what's being reported from the device instead of hard-code
to 0 to 255 (which might not even be an unsigned range).

Ok, so maybe in that case my automatic calibration is still worth to
put on joydev.c
and users from all joysticks in the quirk list would benefit.

Well, it did the trick if that's what you mean but would be better to
get the correct range from start... But I don't know how difficult it
is, so maybe we'll have to stick with the automatic calibration
afterwards...
