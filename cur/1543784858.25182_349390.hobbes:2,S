Why do people always remember us as using devfs, instead of being one of
the first distro's supporting it (if not the first) ? :(  I already
added support for udev to the initscripts back in Sep 2003, and added
the udev-0.2 package to the tree in Oct 2003.

Not entirely true, but he did start to maintain the udev package around
udev-022.
