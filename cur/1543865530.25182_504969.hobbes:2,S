I am not from Intel, but the article at

says
"Please note that currently the HECI driver is available for windows OS
and it will be made available on Linux OS in a future release."
Nice that it will be made available on Linux in the future, but I
  feel somewhat let down here, Intel.  Your support for your wireless
  and graphics chips on Linux is what has made you a top contender for
  my hardware purchases.
