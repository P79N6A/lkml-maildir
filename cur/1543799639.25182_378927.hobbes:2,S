OHHH! Your question is about __preemption__!!!
That's a completely different story, because if a process gets
preempted, it will _not_ be taken off the runqueue even if it's state is
in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE.  Otherwise, there would be lots of places in
the kernel that is broken.
from schedule in sched.c:
/* when preempted, the preempt_count gets "PREEMPT_ACTIVE"
   so the following if will not be entered */
	if (prev->state && !(preempt_count() & PREEMPT_ACTIVE)) {
		switch_count = &prev->nvcsw;
		if (unlikely((prev->state & TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) &&
				unlikely(signal_pending(prev))))
			prev->state = TASK_RUNNING;
		else {
			if (prev->state == TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)
				rq->nr_uninterruptible++;
/* Here we would have taken off the task from the runqueue
   but we don't, so the task _will_ wake up again when it is
   scheduled back in. */
			deactivate_task(prev, rq);
		}
	}
