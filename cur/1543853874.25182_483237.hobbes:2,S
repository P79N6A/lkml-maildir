I follow the instructions on my x86_64 with FC6, that you already know
(
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6419#c47
),
hangs on boot with or without notsc.
I would like try just the part of tglx (hrtimers dyntick)
cause PREEMPT part never works well on my computer (with spontaneous
reboots) 
Thanks,
