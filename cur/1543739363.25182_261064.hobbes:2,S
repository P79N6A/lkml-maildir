OK, I got this to build by enabling CONFIG_SMP, but it died during the
boot process.  It may have been network related, as it hung on when
running ntpdate.  I hit ctrl-C and the boot process continued, but as
soon as gdm started I got a blank screen, I could not get to X or the
console.

This was the last thing in dmesg.  I did not see any errors at all
during the boot process.
I suspect the network driver, via-rhine.
