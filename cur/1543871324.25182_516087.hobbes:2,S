i think you are missing my point.
paravirt_ops is a Linux-internal abstraction that tries to make our life 
easier but it has no relevance whatsoever to an external hypervisor - be 
that Xen, VMWare/ESX or Windows/Longhorn.
What matters is the /ABI/ that the hypervisor uses to talk to a Linux 
guest. In the VMWare/ESX case that's VMI. In the Xen case that's the 
hypercall page call-table ABI or the legacy int $0x82 ABI.
My suggestion would be for Linux to make only a /single/ external ABI 
promise: VMI. (and we can extend it with higher-level paravirt ops, 
etc.)
paravirt_ops has ZERO relevance here... Anyone who suggests that 
paravirt_ops somehow magically hides the ABIs that are behind it (and 
its effects on Linux) is smoking something real funny ;-)
