What about the case that the partition was formatted by another OS though 
and that other OS put something on the last sector? (eg. copy of 
bootsector) Would that be accessible just by setting the block size to 512?
And what about user space utilities? They can't read the last sector on an 
odd sized partition either even if the partition's fs had a block size of 
512 due to the vfs blockdevice support using 1024 bytes blocks. [Yes I know 
you can cheat and read it from the disk device file rather than the 
partition device file.]
All those problems disappear as soon as you change BLOCK_SIZE to 512. And 
yes, I know this is the default and not necessarily the actual size. - But 
that is irrelevant since it effectuates a minimum blksize_size of 
BLOCK_SIZE on most devices. - If BLOCK_SIZE was just a default and a 
smaller hardsectsize would result in a smaller than BLOCK_SIZE blksize_size 
then I wouldn't be complaining but as it is this doesn't happen and in fact 
hardsectsize is often 0 so that the default BLOCK_SIZE is used. - It just 
happens that the default is not quite compatible with devices where it 
should be 512.
Again, if there is a simpler solution which makes both kernel and user mode 
apps behave correctly then I would be glad to hear it...
