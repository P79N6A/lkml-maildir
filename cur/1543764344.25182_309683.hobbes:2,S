In the not-too distant past, one could disable Ctl-Alt-DEL.
Can't do it anymore.

Observe that reboot() returns 0 and `strace` understands what
parameters were passed. The result is that, if I hit Ctl-Alt-Del,
`init` will still execute the shutdown-order (INIT 0).
A side note, while researching this problem, I think I found
that LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2 is Linus' birthday (in hex). Maybe
the problem is that he no longer observes his birthday?
Cheers,
