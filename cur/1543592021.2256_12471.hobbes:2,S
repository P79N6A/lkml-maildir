This sounds like a bug I have heard before: some switches don't work with
the xircom card (well, our drivers for it) when doing full duplex.
Could you try the latest driver from 
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv
which forces the card to half-duplex? 
I manage to get 8Mbyte/sec with it without any problems.
