You guessed right.  Hot removeable memory can only be allocated
for uses that we can easily re-allocate.  So kmalloc() etc. have
to get memory from some area that we promise not to ever try to
remove.

There are some pages that will have to be copied (e.g. pages that
the user "mlock()d" should still be locked in their new location,
same for hugetlbfs pages).
