No, you read that gcc notices when the entirety of a source file is
wrapped in an #ifdef guard and won't re-read that file when it's included
again if the symbol is defined.

Yes, but you don't need to put them around the #include.  Just make sure
there is nothing but comments outside the multiple inclusion guards in the
header files and any competent compiler will do the right thing.
