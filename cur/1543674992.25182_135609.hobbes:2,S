Subject: SiS USB IRQ (Was: [patch] sis650 irq router fix for 2.4.x)

Not relevant to the 650, but for the 630: Going through the datasheet 
revealed that the 630 (with built-in Super South Bridge) does not know 
register 0x62 (of the "ISA bridge", speak the irq router, 00:01.0, 
1039:0008, revision 0) - it's reserved there, but the datasheets states 
explicitly that bit 7 should be set to 1.
The USB interrupts and their routing is determined by bit 8 register 
0x04 of the USB OHCI configuration space (00:01.2 and 00:01.3).
Perhaps some interrupt guru knows what to do with this information and 
is able to verify that the current implementation does this right...
