3ware Escalade Raid controllers are your best bet. They are supported in
the default kernel and provide web and command line administration tools
for linux.

Well when considering SATA last time I checked libata (library used by
open source SATA drivers) didn't support hotswapping. So really you can't
build a proper RAID 5 array without that. Some one can correct me if
Hotswap has now been added.
Some of the proprietary drivers may support hotswap, but I really don't
know. I know we played with the SIL3112a but never tried hotswap.
