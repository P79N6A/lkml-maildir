Basically, you do this:
$ set -o noclobber
$ git-rev-tree --bisect ^good1 ^good2 bad > .git/refs/heads/tryN
$ git checkout tryN
(Initially, "good" is v2.6.12 or whatever version last worked for you;
 "bad" is "master", thus:
 $ git-rev-tree --bisect ^v2.6.12 master > .git/refs/heads/tryN
)
Build kernel, test. If good, add tryN to the list of good kernels, above;
if bad, replace "bad" with "tryN". N += 1. Repeat.
