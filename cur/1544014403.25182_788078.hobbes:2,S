pulled most of it, thanks Steve, except this bit:

writing_enabled is at least as confusing as tracing_on - if not more so.
The user really does not care about all the deeper machinery that happens 
in ftrace - the difference between a 'light' disabling of a tracer and a 
'heavy' disabling of a tracer (which means it unregisters itself 
completely in essence).
To resolve this, we should probably hide this difference altogether (as i 
have suggested to do many months ago, when this first came up), by 
removing tracing_enabled.
A tracer can still be fully unregistered: by simply switching the current 
tracer to the 'nop' tracer. tracing_on/off remains the lightweight version 
that most users are interested in anyway.
