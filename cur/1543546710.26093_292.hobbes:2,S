Good afternoon-
Forgive me if this is not the proper place or if this has been mentioned before;
I checked the archive but didn't find any references. It's kind of an obscure
thing and I'm working around it by not using the mouse.
The situation: We have a cluster of 8 dual pentium II 400s, currently with Red
Hat 6.2 on them. They all share a single monitor/keyboard/mouse, but our console
switch recently died. Thus, for cases where we can't log in remotely (testing
new network drivers, etc) and need to use the console, we have to physically
unplug the monitor/keyboard/mouse from one machine and plug it into another.
The kernel: 2.4.0-test7 with SMP support
The problem: When the mouse (standard PS/2 2-button) is plugged in, the machine
dies. Sometimes it halts everything and no kernel dump is recorded in the logs,
other times the machine can still be logged into remotely and works. Doing this
with older kernels (2.2.14 is also on the boxes) works without problems.
To recreate (on these machines): unplug the mouse and plug it back in.
The details (if there isn't enough here, email me and I will be glad to tell you
more than you ever wanted to know... I just don't have time to track it down or
figure out what stupid thing I'm doing):
