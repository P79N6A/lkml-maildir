Kernel infrastructure changes, and drivers need to track that.  You
simply MUST expect changes across different -stable- versions of the
kernel drivers.

This becomes easier after the 2.3 changes, but a driver simply must
driver kernel versions.  There is no way around that.  Older drivers
might continue to work with newer kernels, but if they are not updated,
they do not work well.

The whole reason for incremental patches is that it makes it easier to
find and resolve bugs and other issues.  In development kernels, you
must also update (and test) for infrastructure changes.

Think about about the kernel is developed.  The odd series is
development, and would never go to a customer.  The even series is
stability, and does go to customers.  And you can be SURE that both the
customer and the developer will appreciate incremental changes when it
turns out that a stable bug fix is not really stable.
Changes are easier to isolate with incremental changes.  One big update
means things work, or they don't -- with the fallback (before the
update) typically being a far inferior, and more buggy version of the
software.
