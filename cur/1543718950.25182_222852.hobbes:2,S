Oops... I didn't notice the Pentium I stuff. This discards
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER and will probably leave the CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER out
as, AFAIK, it depends on ACPI. I don't know if your machine does have a
working ACPI implementation, even more if it will be able to support
CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER. So, I must confess my total ignorance on such an
old hardware. Anyone?
