How much bandwith does this require?
Currently, 2.6.12-rc3-mm1 requires 3.7 MB for the -rc3 patch (which can 
be used for several -mm patches) plus 2.6 MB for the -mm patch.
The 47 MB download for 2.6.11 are required only once for the many -mm 
kernels between 2.6.11 and 2.6.12.
Looking at these numbers, the average download required for every -mm 
kernel is currently far below 10 MB.
