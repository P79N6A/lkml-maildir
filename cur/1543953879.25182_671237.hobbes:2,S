Andrew explained that in_atomic() could deadlock if called in a
condition where it is unreliable (although I did not understand the
details). Documenting that a "yes" from in_atomic() can always be
trusted, would invite driver authors to still use it, when my
understanding is that they still shouldn't.
If drivers shouldn't use in_atomic() at all then I think that the
long-term solution is to move its definition out of <linux/hardirq.h>.
But of course this means fixing all the drivers that still use it first.
