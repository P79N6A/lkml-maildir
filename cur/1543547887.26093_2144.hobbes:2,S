Apparently you didn't bother to read past the sentence that you quoted.  I
understand quite well that Linus doesn't care.  I understand that he does
not think that those things are good.  I even agree with him that from
where he's coming from and the kind of development process that he's
trying to create that those things aren't good.
Take a valium and read what I wrote again.
