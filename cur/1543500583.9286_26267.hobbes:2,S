The userspace version already exists. It is called a compound document
file or structured storage. Users with large image-laden documents
tend to have performance problems. Users are forced to work around
the problem. (by putting each chapter of a book in a separate file)
From userspace, you only get the performance by using directories.
See my response to Theodore Y. Ts'o for why this is broken.

Some people still use libc 4. Some people have commercial software.
Some people have lost their source code.
Userspace should not suddenly break.

That was the only thing they could do from userspace, and it stinks.
It is a slow and unreliable way to identify a compound document.

So, what happens if the hidden name is ".albod" and my software
tries to use ".albod" as the name of a document component?

Sorry, but Microsoft isn't going to just go away any time soon.
Most of the world has to deal with Windows tools, Windows clients,
and Windows filesystems. It will take a _minimum_ of 20 years for
the world to get rid of Microsoft.
