OK, this one thing isn't going to be noticable. But why you really
must have the check for every page, and not in the logical place
where we batch them up? You're obviously aiming for the lowest
latencies possible *without* CONFIG_PREEMPT.
But I'm thinking, why add overhead for people who don't care about
sub-ms latency (ie. most of us)? And at the same time, why would
anyone in a latency critical environment not enable preempt?

No, I'm not worried about that.

OK.
Alternatively, I'd say tell everyone who wants really low latency to
enable CONFIG_PREEMPT, which automatically gives the minimum possible
preempt latency, delimited (and defined) by critical sections, instead
of the more ad-hoc "sprinkling" ;)
