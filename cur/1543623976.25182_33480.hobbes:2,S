I'll go for this (although it's probably a 2.5 thing rather than 2.4).  The 
key to making an effective split is to get the abstractions in the generic 
part correct.  I suspect that each of the different arch's has slightly 
different abstraction requirements of the i386 routines, but if we begin the 
split in one arch and pass it around to the others we'll end up with something 
that is roughly correct.
I'll look at doing at least a generic and voyager in the next week (if I get 
time).
