Has this issue been fixed?  Or is this not a kernel bug?

| Almost any suid binary may be used to create large files overriding quota
| limits.
| 
| When setuid-root binary inherits file descriptors from user process it may
| write to it without respecting the quota restrictions. This is because
| suid process has CAP_SYS_RESOURCE effective capability enabled during
| writing to the file. Quota does not know anything about who opened file
| descriptor and checks current process privileges only. This is bug in
| kernel and not in those setuid-root binaries.
