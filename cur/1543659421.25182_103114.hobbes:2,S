	A random driver like linux-2.5.57/drivers/isapnp/core.c, line
1128, which was changed _from_ referencing isapnp_protocol _to_
referencing isapnp_card_protocol?  Also, if isapnp_card_protocol is
supposed to be deleted, then presumably so should its extern
declaration at line 106 of the same file.
	Come to think of it, core.c is the only file that references
isapnp_card_protocol in 2.5.57.  _If_ isapnp_card_protocol really
should be deleted, then here is a patch for it.
