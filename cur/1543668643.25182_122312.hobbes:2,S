Depends on what you consider to be up-to-date. But I guess, you want
to have all the security fixes and important bug fixes and nothing
but.
James Bourne intends to maintain that and has put it somewhere on
www.hardrock.org (although I cannot find it right now).
James and H. Peter still haven't gotten around to put the stuff on
www.kernel.org, where most people would expect it to be. *hint*
