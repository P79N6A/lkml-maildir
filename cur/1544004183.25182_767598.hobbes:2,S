Well, at the moment I'm up to my armpits in alligators.  That said,
we're going to have to pull in this code regardless, ugliness and all,
since we're guaranteed to run into the soft lockup bug otherwise.  This
means that I'll have strong incentive to come back and readdress the fix
to remove the ugliness and address Peter's concerns.  I have no idea
when that will be, however.
