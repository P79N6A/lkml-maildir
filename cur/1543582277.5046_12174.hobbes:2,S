    Recently I came across two more things, that are possibly related to
IO-APIC problems:
1)
http://xfree86.org/pipermail/xpert/2001January/004751.html
    Someone with SMP that has problem with interrupt delivery (stuck
interrupt). Only in SMP mode and this is not NE2000 related.
2)

   It turns out, that there's an errata in early Pentium III revisions,
that could corrupt data written to IO-APIC. ( Only if SSE write is
followed by an APIC write)
