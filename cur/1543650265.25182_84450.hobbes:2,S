It seems an additional mechanism is needed to prevent LD_PRELOAD from loading 
non-standard libraries for executables that are not suid/sgid, if those 
executables have any effective or permitted capabilities that the calling 
process doesn't have already.
This shouldn't be too hard; perhaps Ulrich has an opinion on that.

Sorry, I don't know exactly what was your plan here. Could you please explain?
A perhaps unrelated note: We once had Pavel Machek's elfcap implementation, in 
which capabilities were stored in ELF. This was a bad idea because being able 
to create executables does not imply the user is capable of CAP_SETFCAP, and 
users shouldn't be able to freely choose their capabilities :-] We still want 
to be able to grant additional capabilities to a binary that are not owned by 
root though. Extended attributes to overcome this limitation.
There also has to be a mechanism to drop capabilities off binaries if they are 
written to (on write or perhaps on open).
The final goal would be the `incapable root user', i.e., we would not give 
suid root binaries any capabilities except those that are explicitly defined.
