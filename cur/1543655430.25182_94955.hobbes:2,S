Hi Andrew, George, Everyone,
This is derived from my "alternate Posix timers" patch.  It 
was intended to be a general purpose allocator and lookup
for user space ids (e.g. pids, timer_ids, msg_ids).
It uses a radix tree as a sparse array to map a user id value
to a kernel pointer.  In my version it did pid style allocation
avoiding immediate reuse of the same id values.  The goals
were to avoid hardwired limits, be memory efficient and fast.
I got started on this before Ingo did his magic for hashing
pids.  I prototyped in user space and did a quick hack to
make it work in the kernel.  Yes, it uses a recursive approach
for the allocate and remove path.  The recursion is limited 
to only a few levels and the stack frame is tiny.  For example
if there are 1000000 ids it will have 6 levels of recursion.
Here is my version of this interface:
void *id2ptr_lookup(struct id *idp, int id)
	This looks up the user id value in the idp name space
	and returns the associated kernel pointer.
int id2ptr_new(struct id *idp, void *ptr)
	This allocates and returns a new id and stores the 
	ptr value in the sparse array
void id2ptr_remove(struct id *idp, int id)
	removes the id from the idp name space.
void id2ptr_init(struct id *idp, int min_wrap)
	Initializes the idp name space.  The min_wrap value
	determines when to start reusing id values.
I think what I have done is useful and useable.  If/when I do 
this again I would separate growing the tree from the id
allocation.  I think this would avoid needing to keep 
the free list of preallocated memory.
