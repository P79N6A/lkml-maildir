Hi,
	This code snippet in ide_cdrom_register() seems really
strange...
	devinfo->ops = &ide_cdrom_dops;
	devinfo->mask = 0;
>>>	*(int *)&devinfo->speed = CDROM_STATE_FLAGS (drive)->current_speed;
>>>	*(int *)&devinfo->capacity = nslots;
	devinfo->handle = (void *) drive;
	strcpy(devinfo->name, drive->name);
devinfo->speed and devinfo->capacity are both ints.  So the casts are
just a disaster waiting to happen, if the types of capacity or speed
ever change?
