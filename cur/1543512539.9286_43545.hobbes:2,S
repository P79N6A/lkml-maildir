Sorry, no. Newbies want the system to take care of PnP, device-wise. How it
does so (a fully populated /dev, a dynamic /dev, Ouija chip, ...) is of no
concern to them. Our concern is different: How do we provide said black
magic efficiently. IMHO, a dynamic /dev is overkill (you want to have the
available devices, nobody says they have to be _just_ the available
devices), and underkill (no real persistence, no clean way to add ACLs and
whatnot) at the same time. Plus horrible bloat (the kernel will have to
contain code for every possible hot-pluggable device type, just in case one
of them happens to show up), and no reasonable way of notifying userland
about new devices (that being the _real_ need for PnP).  Rummaging around
under hundreds of devices, or dozens of device clases at least, isn't
"reasonable notification" in my book.

The major,minor representation of devices is completely orthogonal to a

Userspace will need the appropiate kernel notification anyway, independent
of /dev being dynamic or static. Automount works that way today. I've
played with automounting my CD (module!) via autofs, works silky. Just
unmounting doesn't work right. I'd want to unmount when I try to eject the
CD (if no users, that is). That can't work because on PCs the CD drive
doesn't notify of that fact. :(
