Then that person should double check their changes against
the problems reported, and re-convince themselves that the
breakage wasn't from those.  Simple.

Yup, but they're more specific than just that entire subsystem,
and the maintainers are actively pursuing the problems.
Exactly what should be happening.

If the code I'm touching breaks, then I'll fix it ASAP,
exactly what the users of that code might expect.

It's not about blame, it's about paying attention to breakages in code that a
person claims to be supporting, and then doing their best to resolve the issues.
Again, if one has the time to actively write/modify code such that something breaks,
then that person should also make time to fix the breakages.

For the third time, no disagreement here.  git-bsect can help in many cases,
but not in all cases.  And it requires a great time commitment from somebody
who's system used to work and now doesn't work.  The person who broke it has
a fair bit of responsibility there, too.
