I would agree.

This is an expected symptom of broken code not dealing with jiffies wrap
properly.  Something is waiting for a timeout that won't happen for another
1.3 years.
AFAIK, in the 2.1 kernel development days there was an audit
of all users of jiffies so that they properly used (there are macros
time_before() and time_after() which are supposed to handle jiffies wrap).
I imagine that if you did a grep on jiffies for the drivers you use, you
would find that lots of code is again doing "time + foo > jiffies" or
similar, which is broken for wrap.

Maybe not in the 2.4 kernel, but definitely in the 2.5 kernel Linus will
enable this as a "no-option option", just like he did with SMP in older
development kernels.  It _may_ be that the Chief Penguin will put his
foot (flipper?) down and enable it for 2.4 as well, just to get it fixed
ASAP.  Otherwise it just means that there will be an upper bound on how
long a 2.4 kernel can run.

I agree.  Do we need a 64-bit jiffies value for gettimeofday, or is this
handled by the CPU TSC these days?  I'm not really aware of other places
that would need a 64-bit value in a fast path (such that locking and a
function call to get_jiffies64() is unacceptable).
Cheers, Andreas
