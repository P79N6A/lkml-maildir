Subject: UP kernel reports SMP?

i haven't been able to use dosemu with a devel kernel in about a year. no
on my UP system, no matter which kernel (UP, SMP) i'm using, it always warns
me that i'm using an SMP kernel and it may be unstable. furthermore, dosemu
always compiles against the devel kernel cleanly, but freezes when booting.
i'm not sure if this is a dosemu or kernel problem. i've mailed the dosemu
maintainer, and got no reply.
