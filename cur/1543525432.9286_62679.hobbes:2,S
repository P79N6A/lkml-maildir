See another mail I just sent. Looking at the future picture, we are using
28/32 capabilties. The rate at which we are finding "holes" in the
capability list is admittedly small. However, I expect this to accelerate
as people are starting to use capabilities to de-priv programs.
I would be happier with 64 bit (or greater) capability fields in any
filesystem structures; it has the potential to save a lot of grief in the
future.
Cheers
