Subject: make allyesconfig broken in 2.5.70-bk10 and -bk11

make allyesconfig hangs just after displaying the following:
<-- SNIP -->
*
* Security options
*
Enable different security models (SECURITY) [N/y/?] (NEW) y
  Socket and Networking Security Hooks (SECURITY_NETWORK) [N/y/?] (NEW) y
  Default Linux Capabilities (SECURITY_CAPABILITIES) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) y
  Root Plug Support (SECURITY_ROOTPLUG) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) y
*
* Cryptographic options
*
-----
make allyesconfig works just fine for -bk9.
