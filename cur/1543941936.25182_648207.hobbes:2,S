Okay, I was assuming this is mapping heap..
  /* Calling set_brk effectively mmaps the pages that we need
         * for the bss and break sections.  We must do this before
         * mapping in the interpreter, to make sure it doesn't wind
         * up getting placed where the bss needs to go.
         */
        retval = set_brk(elf_bss, elf_brk);
If I add
+       elf_brk += random;
before set_brk() (and revert the brk randomization), it works,
including columns.
If I add
+//     elf_bss += random;
before set_brk(), I break everything.
