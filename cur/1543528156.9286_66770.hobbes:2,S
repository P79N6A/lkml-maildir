Ouch!  Yes that is very important that you configure your kernel
for the laptop, and not just use the one from the other machine!
I keep the .configs for all my kernel builds on my main machines
/boot directory.  They're all named uniquely by hostname/CPUtype
like:
K6-2.2.14-1asdf.capslock.lan
It is a good way of centrally keeping track of them all.
