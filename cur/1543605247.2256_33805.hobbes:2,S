Actually 3.5G per-process is theoretically possible using a careful
userspace as Rik suggested with -aa after enabling the proper
compile time configuration option. So for apps that needs say 3G
per-process it should work just fine. But of course for anything that
needs more than that 64bit is the right way to go :)
