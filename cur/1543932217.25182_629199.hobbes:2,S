It's more than weird.

The time, when we entered idle on CPU#0 is in the future.

But the tick is not stopped, that means CPU#0 has work to do
On CPU#1 idle entry just happened:

Again, idle_entry on CPU#0 is in the future.
On CPU#1 the idle entry was at:

which means: 0.257462802 sec. ago

Aarg. On CPU#0 this is consistently in the future:

I'm really confused.

Here is the next inconsistent data:

CPU#1 just woke up. That means the broadcast oneshot mask must be
cleared for CPU#1.
Some real strange thing is going on in your box.
I try to come up with some more debug patches tomorrow.
