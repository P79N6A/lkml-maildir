Yeah, that would be much better, and I don't like having something in
a header file including arch specific files like that. I target to get
lguest going on non x86, so I would like to encourage anyone to think
more than x86 when trying to seperate out something :)
IMHO we should avoid any header files with asm specific code in
drivers/lguest - in a way I prefer having arch/<foo>/lguest to
drivers/lguest/<arch>, would be more esthetically compliant with
the include/asm-<arch> approach too, but thats not a big deal.
Cheers,
Jes
