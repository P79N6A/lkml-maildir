[To:linux-kernel & CC:linux-fbdev-devel]
Hello,
I've written a framebuffer (fbdev) driver for the 3DLabs Permedia3
chipset, targeted at both kernel 2.2.x and 2.4.y, and available at:
<
http://www.irisa.fr/prive/dolbeau/pm3fb/pm3fb.html>
As mentioned on the page, the driver hasn't been thoroughly
tested except on my board, as even after two announcements
on the fbdev-devel list there hasn't been any answer beside
a XFree86 driver develloper. Fortunately that's two different
boards on two different architectures of different endianess.
The only _known_ remaining bug relate to depth switching,
going from 8 to 16/32 bpp give a wrong colormap (need to
go to X and back to restore). The only known current fix
is a small patch again driver/video/fbgen.c that probably
break something else, so I haven't included it in the
distributed patch.
If the driver is ever integrated, here's the MAINTAINERS
stuff: (not yet included in the linux kernel patches)
