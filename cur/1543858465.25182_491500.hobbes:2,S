What you suggest is not a "small kernel module". It's what we have now,
writing a complete driver.

That's what UIO does, plus some standard sysfs files, that tell you e.g.
the size of the cards memory you can map. There are standard file names
that allow you e.g. to automatically search for all registered uio 
drivers and their properties.

If the card already has that data in its dual port RAM, you do an
unneccessary copy.

Here you do the next unneccessary copy.

Implementing ioctls for everything is bad coding style and a has bad
performance. I said "high-end AD card", that means you have a 
signal processor on that board, want to download firmware to it 
and so on. You end up copying lots of data between user space
and kernel space.

Yes, that's a complete kernel driver that you'd never get into
a mainline kernel. Furthermore, the card manufacturer would have to
employ at least two experienced Linux _kernel_ programmers. That's
too much for a small company who's business is something different.

You can achieve 100 lines with uio, including sysfs and poll. What you
describe would never fit in 200 lines for a non-trivial card.
