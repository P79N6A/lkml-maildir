The code to disable prefetch on Athlon is 300 bytes and hurts your PIV?
Really? I'll dig back through the code, but I recall it as adding or
deleting an entry in a table to enable prefetch. If it's affecting PIV the
code to use prefetch is seriously broken.
And since this only buys 2-5% in the kernel, I really question your "ruins
performance" claim.

You mean you have a program which enables userspace prefetch and doesn't
handle the botch? Or that you have programs which you compiled for PIV and
which don't run properly on Athlon. It's called misconfigured, they won't
run on 386 either.
