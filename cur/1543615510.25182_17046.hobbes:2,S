I use smbfs to mount a visual sourcesafe database,
and run ss via wine.  The combination is very slow.
Don't know how much of it is wine, and how much is smbfs,
but any speedup would be greatly appreciated.
(Eventually, wine will bundle its own smb code, but for
now if you want to access network shares, smbfs is the only way.)
