The strategy I use for changing the protection in currently a bit ugly, 
since it
1) Flushes caches.
2) Invalidates all relevant PTE entries
3) Changes the kernel mapping caching policy.
4) Flushes tlb
5) Relies on nopage() to get called to map the page with the new caching 
policy.
Here I must set vm_page_prot, since that it what is used for the newly 
mapped page.

Yes. I've tried running mprotect() and it does indeed reset the caching 
policy.

Agreed. That would work unless also nopage() uses pte_modify to set the 
original caching policy. Then it will get masked away.

I'm not sure it will work in my case, since the caching policy is a 
per-page attribute and I rely totally on nopage() to get called for 
every new page attached to a vma mapping the region.

When nopage() gets called, I set vm_page_prot to 
modify_for_caching( protection_map[vma-> vm_flags & 0x0f])
Again, since someone might have called mprotect() to change vm_flags and 
I can't rely on previous values of vm_page_prot since it's changing all 
the time.
Anyway, thanks for looking at this and if there is something I can do 
(patch maybe) to
correct this behaviour plese let me know.
