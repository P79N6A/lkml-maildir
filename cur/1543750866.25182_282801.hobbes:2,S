Forward port of this patch to 2.6.10-mm1 here:

Obviously, you'll need to patch a plain 2.6.10 with -mm1 from Andrew Morton,
but folks should be able to do this by now. ;)
You'll have to apply Ingo's patch so that it gets rejects and then apply
this patch on top of it so that it resolves those issues. It's a bit
sloppy, but this'll at least be somewhat workable until Ingo comes back
and pounds us with patches. :)
