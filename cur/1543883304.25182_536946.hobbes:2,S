could the CPU have dropped speed for that bootup (some CPUs do that 
automatically upon overheating), or perhaps if you are using some RAID 
array, could it have done a background resync? Especially the bootup 
slowdown you saw seemed significant, and because bootup speed is 90% IO 
dominated, the CPU scheduler seems an unlikely candidate.
