Hi Riley, hi Dave,
I've found the main error, and it was mine.
If /sbin/init is dependant on shared libraries (and also /bin/sh), and
those libraries and the loader reside on /lib, which is on /dev/ram2,
then by re-mounting the root device /dev/ram1 while not having /dev/ram2
no dynamically linked program could be started.
The ram disk itself was completely correct.
It's sometime so easy and hard to find such an error !
After I've shuffled the programs and libraries a bit, now booting works as
never having done something else. The ramdisk version now works.
What's persisting now is the difference between 2.2.1 and 2.2.5 with
d_count and re-mounting the initial ramdisk, but that's an error which I
will report seperately into linux-kernel. May be I will report the
solution, too.
Thanks for your help and your ideas. If I could help you, feel free to
ask, too.
Regards
Frank
