Yes, this is fine, but is it worth writing the feature discovery code?  
I suppose it doesn't matter, as it gets jettisoned after init.  I guess 
it is just preference.
Considering run time code size, the alternative approach wins, has no 
extra branches, and is just nicer.  The faulting technique requires two 
extra dwords of space that can not be jettisonned.  So obviously, I must 
do it (the alternative approach).
Could we consider doing the same with LOCK prefix for SMP kernels booted 
on UP?  Evil grin.
