Subject: NFSCTL_LOCKD (0x10000) unimplemented? (2.4.0-test5-pre4)

Hi guys,
Looking at nfs-utils-0.1.9.1/support/nfs/lockdsvc.c:lockdsvc() function I
see that it makes nfsservctl(2) system call with cmd=NFSCTL_LOCKD
(0x10000) and looking at the kernel side in
fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c:handle_sys_nfsservctl() I see that it is unimplemented
and so starting /usr/sbin/rpc.lockd rightly returns EINVAL.
Is someone working on implementing it or does one have to start from
scratch today?
Regards,
Tigran
