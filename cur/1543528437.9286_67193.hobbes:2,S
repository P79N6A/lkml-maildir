Try to run this proggy in all CPUs at the same time while timetest is
running into the background. Also benchmark that it will take around
5msec on your machine (change the value of i to make it to run for such
time).
main ()
{
	volatile int i = 50000;
	iopl(3);
	asm("cli");
	while(i--);
}

No, lost_ticks is protected by the rw xtime_lock. You can read it with a
read lock, and you can write it with an exclusive write lock.
