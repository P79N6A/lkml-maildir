In discussions with some developers from JFS and CIFS, it was
suggested that the best thing would be to submit one patch with the
whole contents of the fs/ecryptfs directory, since it is a new
filesystem with no modifications to existing code.  What sort of
logical chunks would you consider to be appropriate?  Separate patches
for each file (inode.c, file.c, super.c, etc.), which represent sets
of functions for each major VFS object?
Thanks,
Mike
