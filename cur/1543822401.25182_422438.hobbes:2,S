Hello, Daniel.
This fix comes up every so often and I have submitted almost identical 
patch several months ago.  Unfortunately, it's not the proper fix and 
won't be accepted.  All those read/writeX()'s and in/outX()'s are 
scheduled (for a looooong time) to be converted to new unified 
ioread/writeX()'s.  Things are in progress (well, or halt) in the #iomap 
branch of libata-dev devel tree.  libata needs some updates in host 
initialization part for this conversion to complete.
Thanks.
