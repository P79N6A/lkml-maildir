You should have very good reasons for making a kernel thread. 
As in "it can't be done in userspace".
When running a kernel thread you have "process" that is 
a) using the kernel memory, not it own private
b) the CPU is in privilege mode, not user mode
c) libc don't exist
If you don't understand the difference between kernel mode and user
mode, your question suggest you don't, read chapter two in 
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/bookindexpdf.html
and please keep of lkml, and direct you questions to the kernelnewbie
