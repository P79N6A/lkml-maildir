Yes, it saddens me too. There really are a bunch of cases to check for
on each page that is shared with do_generic_mapping_read(), I'll see if
I can do something about that.

Putting the page in the pipe is a simple reference operations. However,
we can migrate a page from a pipe into the page cache in another address
space. If we do that, we will lock the page first though. And the actual
->index change is inside the tree_lock, outside of splice itself.
So with splice migrating pages, ->index and ->mapping can and will
change but only with the page locked.
