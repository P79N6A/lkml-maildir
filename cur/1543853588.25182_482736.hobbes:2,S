Subject: [RFC, Patch 0/1] OProfile for Cell: Initial profiling support -- new patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I will be posting a patch that updates the OProfile kernel driver to 
enable it for the Cell Broadband Engine processor.  The patch is based 
on Arnd Bergmann's arnd6 patchset for 2.6.18  
(
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/arnd/patches/2.6.18-arnd6/
), 
with Kevin Corry's cbe_pmu_interrupt patch on applied on top.  Kevin 
Corry's patch was submitted to the mailing lists earlier today and can 
be found at:
 http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116360639928471&w=2).
I will also post an OProfile userpsace patch to the oprofile-list that 
adds the necessary support for the Cell processor.
Thanks in advance for your review of this patch.
