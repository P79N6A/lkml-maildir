This is not a very good solution, since it requires all users of the
bios to know how to free it. Right now it is hidden.
And adds additional atomic check (although reading is quite fast) in the
end_io. And for what purpose? To eat 8 bytes on 64bit platform? This
will not reduce its size noticebly, so the same number of bios will be
in the cache's page, so what is a gain? All this cleanups and logic
complicatins should be performed only if after size shring increased
number of bios can fit into cache's page, will it be done after such
cleanups?
