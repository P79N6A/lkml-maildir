The original use case for these batch operations was in a fastpath -
setting data lines on a framebuffer.  Sure it's arguably not as generic
as may be, but it optimises for speed and current usage patterns - I'm
OK with that.  Other usage patterns which don't have a speed requirement
can be done using the individual pin operations and a loop.

I think the read/write operations should be able to fail if you give
them invalid chunks of gpio, sure.  Request/free are not really designed
for that operation - they just ensure exclusive access to a gpio if
that's what the driver wants.  In the batch case the
request/free/direction operations can once again be performed by single
pin operations and iteration.

Yeah the request/free operation doesn't deal with muxing or any other
platform-specific kinda gumph, that was an original design decision.
They're really just a usage counter.
An example which comes to mind is the avr32-specific userspace gpio
interface.  This takes a bitmask, loops over the set bits and fails if
any of the gpio are previously requested or have been assigned to
non-gpio peripherals.  I don't really see a need to streamline this.

Hmm, this seems a little overengineered for the basic use-cases I can
think of.  If this can be cranked up to the same speed as the current
proposition then OK maybe someone will like it but otherwise, once
again, I think most people will be happy with individual operations and
iteration.
