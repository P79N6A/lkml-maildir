It was preloaded.
Of course, there's an assumption here that the dead kernel doesn't scribble
on pages which were never available to its page allocator.  If DMA somehow
goes off and scribbles on the dump kernel we lose.

See above.  We assume that network RX DMA won't be scribbling in the 16MB
which was pre-reserved.  That's reasonable.  We _have_ to assume that.
