So let's rename 2.6.16 to 2.7.0, plus:
 - (implicitly with the *rename*) stop the 2.6.x series
 - never use 2.<even>.x again
   (some people still don't seem to get that <even> does not mean
   "stable" in the 2.4 sense)
   - or start 3.x with an overall new counting scheme
 - follow the current development model as usual
