Ah yes. I'll do that from next post. 
patch [1/4] and [2/4] doesnt modify memcg at all. So, I added Andrew to CC.
It's a new feature for cgroup.
for memcg part. of course, I'll wait for all Nishimura's fixes goes to -rc.
patch [3/4] will remove most of them, crazy maze of hierarchical reclaim.
patch [4/4] is written for demonstration. but the output seems atractive.
Thanks,
