It fixed it.
The problem was that pagecache data on the NFS client was showing
incorrect chunks of several k's of zeroes.  No particuar alignment,
either.  And it only happened when the machine is under page-replacement
pressure.  And only when the machine has highmem.
It'd be nice to understand _why_ it fixed it.  Do we know why NFS
was losing data when using KM_USER0?  As far as I can see the new
and old code look pretty darn similar.   Interested.
