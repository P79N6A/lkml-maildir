When one thinks outside the box one has to think about
evolving beyond what you are used to. When I moved
beyond DOS I have to give up the idea of 8.3 file
names. The idea here is to come up with a model that
can emulate the existing system for backwards
compatibility.
The concept behind my model is to create a new layer
where you can do ANYTHING with file names and
permissions and create models that emulate Linux, DOS,
Windows, Mac, or anything else you can dream of. Then
you can create a Linux/Windows/Mac template to emulate
what you are used to.
