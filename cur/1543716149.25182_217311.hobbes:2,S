Subject: [PATCH 0/5] I2O subsystem fixing and cleanup for 2.6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello,
here are 5 patches, which cleanup the I2O subsystem in 2.6.
The patches are as follows:
- i2o-config-clean.patch
   * Changes the formating of the header in i2o_config.c
- i2o-passthru.patch
   * Add a pass-thru ioctl to i2o_config, which is needed to work with
     the Adaptec management software.
- i2o_block-cleanup.patch
   * more than 3 "visible" disks (hda, hdb, hdc, hdd) lead to kernel
     panics.
   * removes some unused code with partitions.
   * I2O_LOCK was often called with the addresses of the controller, and
     not with the address of the device. Fixed.
   * the cleanup function for gendisk (del_gendisk) doesn't work if the
     queue is shared between different devices. To workaround the queue
     is removed before.
   * redundant code removed in module initialization and remove, use
     i2ob_new_device and i2ob_del_device instead.
   * removed atomic_t queue_depth
   * removed unnecessary and bogus code for queue handling
- i2o-64-bit-fix.patch
   * provides i2o_context_list_*() functions, which maps 64-bit pointers
     to 32-bit context id's in a dynamic list. On 32-bit systems the
     functions are replaced with a static inline.
   * i2o_scsi now uses the i2o_context_list_*() functions for transaction
     context, and therefore now work on 64-bit systems too.
- i2o-makefile-cleanup.patch
   * The Kconfig and Makefile in drivers/message/i2o still got a
     CONFIG_I2O_PCI entry, which is not used anymore. This one is
     replaced by a CONFIG_I2O_CONFIG entry, which now builds the
     i2o_config module.
Already posted the first 4 patches to linux-scsi with request for 
review, but expect of the i2o-passthru.patch there where no complains. 
And the request for using the SG_IO in i2o-passthru.patch isn't possible 
at the moment, because it is a char device node.
If you have any questions / problems, please let me know.
Best regards,
Markus Lidel
