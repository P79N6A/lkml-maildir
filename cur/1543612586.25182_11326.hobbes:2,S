Subject: [REQUEST] Linux Hacker Survey - Reminder

Hi LKMLers,
Just a friendly (first and last) reminder about a survey on your experience
with Linux development.
The survey is located here: 
http://www.bcglinuxsurvey.com
 
(It should not take more than 15 minutes to complete) 
All responses will be confidential.
All aggregate results and analysis will be made avaialble to this list and
the public.
We will be giving away 3 gift certificates valued at $200, $100, and $50
(USD) for Thinkgeek.com merchanidse. Winners will be notified by e-mail. To
enter you in the drawing, we will need your response by December 11, 2001. 
We plan to compare this survey with earlier surveys and a recently completed
survey of sourceforge developers.  Your responses will assure results
validity (so far we have over 90 responses from LKML and over 500 responses
from sourceforge developers).
Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns at karim@bcg.com
My original request to the list is here
