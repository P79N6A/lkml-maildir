Users are used to work on characters, not on bytes.

Sure, you can limit what is possible and what not.
But there are still many pitfalls, e.g. if someone would allow the 
construct "[abc]" in patterns for matching one of these characters you'd 
have to ensure that your syntax contains explicit character delimiters 
or a pattern might match something completely different from what was 
intended.
My opinion is that extended parsing of non-ASCII strings will cause too 
many problems, but it seems we can only agree to disagree on this.
