I would not be surprized.........
Since I have been asking for the info for more than two months from Intel,
and just found out that they white page booked it.........
http://developer.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/29065503.pdf
Given the orginal limited spec had it the other way.......
It is a fix that is simple ....... 
ide-pci.c
#define DEVID_PIIX4E    ((ide_pci_devid_t){PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AA_1})
#define DEVID_PIIX4U    ((ide_pci_devid_t){PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AB_1})
change from above to below.
#define DEVID_PIIX4E    ((ide_pci_devid_t){PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AB_1})
#define DEVID_PIIX4U    ((ide_pci_devid_t){PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AA_1})
piix.c
        int ultra               = ((dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82371AB) ||
                                   (dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AA_1)) ? 1 : 0;
        int ultra66             = (dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AB_1)
change from above to below.
        int ultra               = ((dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82371AB) ||
                                   (dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AB_1)) ? 1 : 0;
        int ultra66             = (dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AA_1)
However.......this blocks ata66 for PIIX controllers regardless....
unsigned int __init ata66_piix (ide_hwif_t *hwif)
{
        if (0)
                return 1;
        return 0;
}
hwif->udma_four = (d->ata66_check) ? d->ata66_check(hwif) : 0;
What changes were made to the code that were not original?
It is blocked regardless because of the lines........above.
