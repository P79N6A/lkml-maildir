If we kill only the tasks for which cpuset_mems_allowed_intersects() is true 
on the first pass and even then if we do not get out of oom, we could go over 
again with this expensive check. Using this scheme, could kill more no of 
tasks than required, if a task with lots of memory has moved to a different 
cpuset. But it should be rare and not that severe compared to killing a 
totally innocent task like the current scheme does?!
