Well, SuSE handles this just fine, but I do notice that RHEL 5 disables
the new_id stuff entirely, so I can see why you might get this
impression :)

This is the second time it has occurred that I know of.

I'm not disagreeing that it will help a set of users, or that it will
cause any harm at all.  It's just currently outside the scope for what
we defined -stable as, and it will slightly increase the workload that
Chris and I have in keeping up with these patches.
So, if there is an overwhelming majority of people that strongly feel
that this is a good thing, fine, we can try it out.
I'm just trying to point out that the new_id sysfs stuff is there
explicitly for this very reason, as people were demanding that (Dell
being the major company behind it.)
