If possible it would also be good to fix the misconfigured VPN box
that's breaking the PMTU discovery if you can (usually it's too
aggressive blocking of ICMP messages). Although a wsize/rzise of 1024
and using TCP probably makes sense for NFS over a VPN (avoid
framentation overhead and let TCP handle the retransmission).
My guess is the Watchguard is blocking ICMP "fragmentation needed"
messages (which is resulting in the PMTU discovery breakage).
Enabling ICMP "fragmentation needed" messages to pass through the VPNs
firewall if you can should fix your other problems aswell.
