Note that I think this patch will cripple our nice page table folding
in the unmap path, due to no longer using the 'next' from p??_addr_end,
even if the compiler is very smart.
I haven't confirmed this by looking at assembly, however I'd be almost
sure this is the case. Possibly a followup patch would be in order so
as to restore this, but I couldn't think of a really nice way to do it.
Basically we only want to return the return of the next level
zap_p??_range in the case that it returns with zap_work < 0.
