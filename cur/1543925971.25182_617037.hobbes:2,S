As far as being able to retrieve the slot number (which it seemed from
the HP manageablity application perspective is the goal here), that
information is available from userspace as well for at least standard PCI
and pcie based systems for occupied slots.  For standard pci, you have
to make something up anyway - for shpchp we just use an incremental 
number and combine it with the bus number to represent the slot.  For
pcie, you can get this info from the slot capabilities register.
