That's right.  And it's actually a good thing.  I'm sorry you find it so
hard to accept, but please stop telling us we're wrong and evil.

Nobody wants to see that.  People do want the SCSI core to evolve.
It has evolved substantially in the last few years that I've been paying
attention.  Again, I'm sorry that it's not evolving in the direction that
you'd like it to, but you're not doing a very good job at persuading us
we're wrong.

If the advice is couched in the same terms you've been using recently,
I'm not surprised.

Nope, just a prediction.  Perhaps I should have used 'shall' instead
of 'will'.  If you continue being abusive, you'll end up in peoples
killfiles, which would be a real shame.  If you think people are being
abusive towards you, please rise above it and don't attack them in
return.  We all want your cards supported by the SCSI layer in the best
possible way.  We just disagree about what that best possible way is.
I think we can all agree that the worst possible way is if somebody else
ends up writing a driver for your cards because your code isn't usable.
