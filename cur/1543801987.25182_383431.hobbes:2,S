Great! I really love this.
capable() was a great offender in the sched.h includes cleanup.

Header file detangling. capable() needs to dereference current.
Moving capable() to capability.h would mean that capability.h needs to 
include sched.h, which 1) is inefficient as capability.h is included in 
about 5885 files and sched.h drags in another 133 header files and 2)
results in a circular dependency.
