I'll admit that I don't _fully_ understand it either.  Another user
noticed related behaviour a couple of months ago, below is the patch
which I hope you find fixes yours too.  An equivalent fix (to fs/libfs.c)
went into 2.6.9-rc1-bk1, I'd been waiting for it to get more 2.6 exposure
(lest unwanted side-effects appeared) before sending Marcelo the 2.4 fix.
If it works well for you, let me know and I'll send it in for 2.4.28...
A tmpfs user reported increasingly slow directory reads when repeatedly
creating and unlinking in a mkstemp-like way.  The negative dentries
accumulate alarmingly (until memory pressure finally frees them), and
are just a hindrance to any in-memory filesystem.  shmem_lookup set
d_op to arrange for negative dentries to be deleted immediately.
(But I failed to discover how it is that on-disk filesystems seem to
keep their negative dentries within manageable bounds: this effect was
gross with tmpfs or ramfs, but no problem at all with extN or reiser.)
