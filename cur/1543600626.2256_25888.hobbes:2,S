It detects the AGP chipset fine, but when X starts,
it displays garbage and hard locks the console.
I know it's not an issue with the Radeon DRI driver,
as I compiled the radeon.o module directly out of the
same XFree86 CVS download I was using before I
upgraded my motherboard.
On load the agpgart module does give an odd message:
agpgart: unable to get minor: 175
I checked /dev/agpgart, and it is definitely minor
175.
What does it mean it can't get that minor?
Please CC any responses to me, as I am not subscribed

Thank you very much!
