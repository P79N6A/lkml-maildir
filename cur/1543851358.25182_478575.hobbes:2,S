Thanks again for the refactoring/review and optimizations to the code
base. Some of the earlier patches I'm still processing (to be sure the
timings etc. of signal clearing vs. task exit are right) but these later
ones are pretty straightforward and look good. Testing needed of course.

For stress testing, what we've used is to run
- one listener continuously getting exit stats (prototype listener
code in Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c)
- a multithreaded app where each thread does some disk I/O and some
cpu processing (incrementing a count etc.), threads get created and
destroyed in a continuous loop
- periodically query the multithreaded app above (print out its tgid first)
using another instance of Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c to see
if the delay data is getting incremented as expected by what the threads do.
- cerebrus and/or kernel compiles running in background just to create
a load
You can drop the cerebrus etc. if the load gets too much.
Running the above past a few hours has caught the kind of bugs seen so far.
