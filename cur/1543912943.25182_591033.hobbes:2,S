OK, I've got it figured out now. What happened is this -- alpine has this
nifty feature that (if not explicitly set) it will automatically adjust
the content-type encoding of outgoing mails depending upon the kind of
text it sees written in the mail. Now when I normally post (eg. the first
mail in this set), it naturally goes out as US-ASCII. What was special
about the other mails was that each contained GCC's error/warning output.
And if you've noticed it produces that totally pointless special non-
US-ASCII 'quotes' around wherever it points out the name of an identifier
-- and that confused alpine into thinking I was writing in Japanese (!)
Anyway, I've explicitly set all mails to be sent out as US-ASCII only
now, so hopefully things will be ok ...
