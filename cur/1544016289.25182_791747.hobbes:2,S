Commit d755fb384250d6bd7fd18a0930e71965acc8e72e added a call to
blkdev_issue_flush to ext4_sync_file, and looking at its ext3
counterpart it seems it might be needed there too.
I may be missing something, but is it possible to ensure the inode hits
the platter without the patch below?

Subject: ext3: call blkdev_issue_flush on fsync
To ensure that bits are truly on-disk after an fsync, we should call
blkdev_issue_flush if barriers are supported.
This is a straight port of a similar patch written by Eric Sandeen for
ext4 (commit d755fb384250d6bd7fd18a0930e71965acc8e72e).
