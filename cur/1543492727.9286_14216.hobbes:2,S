Hi Jakub.
I've just checked the format of the records in the quota files, and
there's NO way we could add a header to it that would reliably work
with both old and new tools - the format's incredibly stupid in that
respect.
If we wish to make ANY changes to the quota file format, we need to
define a NEW quota file with a new name, and get the file format
correct to start with...
However, assuming we're thinking of doing that, the following comments
apply...

Not if we do that right.
Basically, we need to ensure that the USERID field in the record or
records occupied by the header contain an invalid user ID for that
system, then the details in the header record will never be modified,
which is the important property.

Are you sure that strategy will work? I would expect it to result in
both old kernels and the old quota tools happily reading records that
consist of the end of one record and the start of the next, and really
mangling the file as a result.
To guarantee that the records in the file are read and handled OK, we
basically need to guarantee that any header we add occupies an EXACT
number of records, and also that the USERID or GROUPID field therein
holds a value that corresponds to an invalid user ID or group ID on
the system in question. Anything else is a non-starter in my opinion.

I'd agree, but we need to be able to DETECT whether the file is in the
format we expect it to be in, even if it should never be in any other
format.

Alternatively, and probably a much more sensible solution here, the
quota enabling tools could refuse to enable quotas on that partition
if the file is in the wrong endian format, and a separate tool could
be provided that runs through the quota file and rewrites it in the
correct endian format for that system.

I've never used UFS as I've had no reason to, so can't comment on
that...

Does the existing quota code do that? If not, then the situation still
needs to be dealt with...

In fact, the current format results in a file which is always a
multiple of 40 bytes, so any size of header that isn't a multiple of
40 bytes would do the job if your theory is correct...
**********************************************************************
A related problem occurs with NFS mounts, and I'd be interested to
know how the following situation is handled:
 1. User JohnDoa has user ID 1234 on the system exporting the
    NFS mounted file system, but has user ID 2345 on the system
    it's exported to.
 2. Both JohnDoa and the user with user ID 2345 on the exporting
    system have private files on that file system.
As far as I can tell, that would result in JohnDoa being able to
access files belonging to user 2345 on the exporting system, but NOT
being able to access his own files thereon...
Best wishes from Riley.
