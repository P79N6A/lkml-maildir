It is not caused by the BAR as it doesn't get changed in this case.  The
pci_restore_state() call is to restore the memory enable bit in the PCI
command register.  The tr32() call in tg3_interrupt() will cause a
master abort if it is called before the memory enable bit has been
restored.

This will break other things.  When we disable interrupts, we set the
irq_sync flag but allow one more interrupt to be generated.  The irq
handler will simply mask off the interrupt when it sees the irq_sync
flag.  With the above change, the irq handler can no longer mask off
this trailing interrupt and you may get screaming interrupts as a
result.
Thanks for reporting this.  I'll try to come up with a good solution.
