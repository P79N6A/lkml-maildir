Not having the kernel part of EVMS doesn't mean EVMS isn't
available to users. EVMS can get a lot of the functionality
using device mapper.

The work put into EVMS this far is maybe 20% of the work that
maintaining EVMS would cost once it's in the kernel.
Developing code is nowhere near as much work as maintaining it
indefinately. Using the device mapper framework makes a lot of
sense from many points of view.
