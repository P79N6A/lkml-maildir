It's not uncertain, the reiser4 people just have to address the issues
that were raised on LKML before it will be merged, just like everyone
else.

No one ever posted any numbers (to LKML anyway) so we don't know.
Maybe you could apply the broken out reiser4 patches from -mm and the
realtime preempt patches.  Testing with PREEMPT_DESKTOP and latency
tracing enabled will tell you whether reiser4 has any latency hot spots.
