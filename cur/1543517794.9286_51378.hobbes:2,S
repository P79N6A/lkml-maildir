I don't like posting a "me too", but Al catches the essence your
misconception. Pay attention.
You get full security by locking your directories. Restricting hard
links to inodes you can write to *does not* improve security. The
existing Unix semantics with uids and gids gives you full flexibilty
to implement a security policy as tight or relaxed as you wish.
