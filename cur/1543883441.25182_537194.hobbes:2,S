Usually there is other and then someone else figures it out.

The Novell bugzilla actually has that fixed. You have a search email button
to look up addresses.  Perhaps that feature will be ported someday into
the kernel.org one (I would like to have it too)

Anyways that are mostly all detail (except the registration requirement) that
could be probably all easily fixed.

The problem is we need a way to route those reports to the right people.
Routing it to a single person or broadcasting it just doesn't scale.
And the best way I know of is to use some database that keeps track of the state.
That is what bugzilla is essentially.

The only sane way to do that would be to save them somewhere and keep
a list and then let a group of people process them.
Hmm, wait... sounds like bugzilla, doesn't it?

I disagree. It works small scale but does not really scale well.
