Sorry for falling in late but we can't do that.
Win 98 (95 too?) shared can not be mounted with CIFS, it requires SMBFS. 
Furthermore, there seems to be a strange CIFS error when trying to do so 
(varying error codes)...:
13:11 shanghai:/etc # mount //wideland/hda1 /mnt/wideland -t smbfs -o password=realw
13:11 shanghai:/etc # ls /mnt/wideland
.               cygwin             DRVSPACE.BIN                      msdos.sys
..              tcpp               IO.SYS                            system.1st

13:11 shanghai:/etc # umount /mnt/wideland
13:11 shanghai:/etc # mount //wideland/hda1 /mnt/wideland -t cifs -o password=realw
mount error 2 = No such file or directory
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g.man mount.cifs)
13:11 shanghai:/etc # mount //wideland/hda1 /mnt/wideland -t cifs -o password=realw
mount error 112 = Host is down
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g.man mount.cifs)
It's certainly not down.
