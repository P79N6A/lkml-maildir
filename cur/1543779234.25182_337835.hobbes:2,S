Right, I thought this was actually a feature :)  This is how ps
continues to show expected output under stacker.  Given naturally limited
space, showing output for multiple modules may not be a good idea.  If
you want more detail, you go to /proc/pid/attr/current...
Clearly this is limiting, but then so is the one line per process you
get with ps - "fixing" that is obviously not acceptable.  Is there
another suggestion for how to handle this, in such a way that ps would
show info for >1 module?  Is there any example where the current
behavior is actually a problem - two modules which it makes sense to
stack, which both need to give output under ps?
thanks,
