Good idea. This part of the patch has to go into ondemand governor.
But, I think there is a minor bug in the code though.
With current ondemand governor, we poll at some X freq and check 
whether we need to increase the freq. And with some Y freq (Y > X and 
a multiple of it), we check whether we need to decrase the freq.
That is the reason I have two different variables 
prev_cpu_idle_down and prev_cpu_idle_up to store the previous idle 
times at these two different polling intervals (X and Y).
Now, you have previous idle time at only one point. So, this may 
not work cleanly. From the code I feel what will happen is
You will only see the CPU activity in last X time and decide on 
frequency down decisions (even though you check this with Y polling 
interval). Not sure whether I was clear with this explanation.
Note, I haven't really run your version yet. This is what 
I feel by looking at the patch. I may well be wrong.

OK. This has to be in ondemand governor as well.

Somehow, I feel quick response time for increased load is more 
important than smooth increase in frequency. As the CPU latency for 
doing the freq transition is lower, I think governor should use that 
and do quick adjustments to the freq depending on the load. Probably, I 
am thinking more in terms of places where performance is critical.
As Dominik pointed out, it's the time to fork put a new ondemand 
governor with this algorithm....

I again agree with Dominik's opinion on this :)
Thanks for all the experiments and all these improvements.
I will rollout a patch for ondemand governor soon, by 
stealing some code from your patch below :)
Thanks,
Venki
