Actually looking even further, we only introduced the extra lookup of the next 
task when we started unlocking the runqueue in schedule(). Since we can get 
by without locking this_rq in schedule with this approach we can simplify 
dependent_sleeper even further by doing the dependent sleeper check after we 
have discovered what next is in schedule and avoid looking it up twice. I'll 
hack something up to do that soon.
