Well, on Solaris running cdrecord root-less is possible since 2 years.
What you do is to add a line
joerg::::profiles=CD RW
to /etc/user_attr
and a line:
CD RW:solaris:cmd:::/opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: privs=file_dac_read,sys_devices,proc_lock_memory,proc_priocntl,net_privaddr
to /etc/security/exec_attr
or to just a line
All:solaris:cmd:::/opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: privs=file_dac_read,sys_devices,proc_lock_memory,proc_priocntl,net_privaddr
to /etc/security/exec_attr
the command then is executed via /usr/vin/pfexec and gets the listed fine 
grained privileges in addition to the basic privileges.
We plan to break sys_devices into more fine grained privs that
include several levels of SCSI rights in the near future.
If Linux manages to do something similar, I would be happy.
It is obvious that this is someting that could only be used if there
is not only kernel code to support fine grained privs but there is a need
for a user space infrastructure that allows to use a seamless integration.
