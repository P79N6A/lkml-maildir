In my opinion you don't understood the icache allocation code.

It's trivial not relaying on the 8k phys consecutive memory. Simply
vmalloc if __get_free_pages fails. To know if you have to free_pages or
vfree simply check of you are towards VMALLOC_START.
Here I never had fragmentation problems but I have to say that I usually
have plenty of memory free...

??? I think you have not understood the issue. Even if a page is 8k you
may like to defrag vmalloced memory at runtime. The implementation could
be difficult and the advantage minimal but it's something that can help
with every kind of page size. I am not telling you that it has to be done
and that it will be great, it's just something that could be done (I
think, maybe I am wrong) and could be useful whith any kind of page size.
