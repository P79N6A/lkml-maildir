Actually I did make a one-liner for 2.6, and found rather a lot (15 or
so if I remember correctly). I also went as far as hacking up something
in gcc, but it was too flaky to go in and I haven't got round to fixing
it up yet.
Some of them were right under our noses for ages:

If you like I can see if I can dig up the gcc patch or the one-liner.

john
