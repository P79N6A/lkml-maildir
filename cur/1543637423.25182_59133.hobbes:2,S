Of course. We do need a consistent ABI... But I don't see that as a big 
problem. There aren't that many places that take sectors as arguments that 
we need to fix AFAICS.
Both there and for user supplied byte offsets/sizes, we just need to check 
that user supplied values are not being overflowed on 32-bit sector_t 
compiled kernels... something like
         if (sizeof(sector_t) == 4) {
                 if (value & ~(((u64)1 << 32) - 1))
                         return -E2BIG;
         }
should compile out nicely for 64-bit sector_t and provide a simple, highly 
optimized check for 32-bit sector_t... (If gcc optimizes it well I should 
hope it will just do a simple 32-bit compare of the high 32-bits with zero...)
I have to admit that if it was just up to me, I would make sector_t 
unconditionally u64, so there don't need to be checks like the above all 
over the place... But that's just me... (-;
Best regards,
         Anton
