Well, from what I can see of the makefiles and sources they distribute, 
they
_don't_ distribute it as kernel+modules, they compile their drivers 
directly
into their kernel:
  ./arch/mips/brcm-boards/bcm96345/Makefile:EXTRA_CFLAGS += 
-I$(TOPDIR)/../../targets
  ./drivers/char/bcm96345/board/Makefile:EXTRA_CFLAGS += -I. 
-I$(HPATH)/asm/bcm96345 -I$(TOPDIR)/../../targets -fno-exceptions
  ./Makefile:SUBDIRS              +=modulesrc/drivers ../../targets
  ./Makefile:DRIVERS-y += modulesrc/drivers/kermods.o ../../targets/bp.o
They may call the directory "modulesrc", but it does _NOT_ appear to be
linked as a kernel module, but directly into the kernel.  I think that 
in this
case their build process is too tightly integrated with the kernel to 
_not_
be a derivative work.
Cheers,
