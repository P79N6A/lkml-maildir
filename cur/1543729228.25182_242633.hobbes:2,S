Subject: [PATCH] PPC64 Don't call scheduler on offline cpu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When taking a cpu offline, once the cpu has been removed from
cpu_online_map, it is not supposed to service any more interrupts.
This presents a problem on ppc64 because we cannot truly disable the
decrementer.  There used to be cpu_is_offline() checks in several
scheduler functions (e.g. rebalance_tick()) which papered over this
issue, but these checks were removed recently.  So with recent 2.6
kernels, an attempt to offline a cpu can result in a crash in
find_busiest_group().  This patch prevents such crashes.
