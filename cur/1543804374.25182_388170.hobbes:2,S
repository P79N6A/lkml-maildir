You'll need to dig back through the archives but this was discussed and
resolved when the M68K merge was done or shortly afterwards. There is no
obvious problem with the licenses either. I believe Jes Sorensen did the
merge in question.

All Rights Reserved is not a problem since there is a license with it
"Not evidence blah" is not a problem because we have permission to
redistribute it.
