It would be better than nothing, for SLQB, I guess.

From the data we have so far, I think SLQB is a "credible prospect" to
replace SLUB and SLAB. But then again, apparently SLUB was a credible
prospect to replace SLAB when it was merged.
Unfortunately I can't honestly say that some serious regression will not
be discovered in SLQB that cannot be fixed. I guess that's never stopped
us merging other rewrites before, though.
I would like to see SLQB merged in mainline, made default, and wait for
some number releases. Then we take what we know, and try to make an
informed decision about the best one to take. I guess that is problematic
in that the rest of the kernel is moving underneath us. Do you have
another idea?

I could have called it SL4B. 4 would be somehow fitting...
