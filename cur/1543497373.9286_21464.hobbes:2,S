Subject: 2.3.4: soft-lockup with SCSI-tape and NFS, NFS-related?

Hello,
while writing a backup using tar from NFS to a SCSI tape I had an soft-
lockup of the system after 1 minute, i.e. the only thing working was sysreq.
This effect is 100% repeatable. Doing a backup from a local filesystem
seems to be not affected, so I guess this is NFS-related.
I managed to capture some EIP values:
c01d4ec5 stext_lock+0x2331
c01d4ecc stext_lock+0x2338
c01d11e1 __delay+0x21
c01d11e0 __delay+0x20
c01d1216 __udelay+0x32
c010adc7 __global_cli+0xcb
c01d121b __udelay+0x37
c01d11c0 __delay
c01d120e __udelay+0x2a
The system is based on Dual-PentiumII, 233MHz,
Gigabyte GA-686LX2 motherboard. The kernel is compiled with
egcs 1.1.2.
The remote NFS-server is Linux-2.2.7, Universal NFS Server 2.2beta29.
