Dr. Rakotozafy was killed on his way to visit the family of the late president of Togo 
(Mr Gnassingbe Eyadema), who died of heart attack on the 5th of February 2005 on a 
good Saturday.
After the death of my father, my mother took us out of Madagascar to south Africa were 
I manage to enter a ship to Europe. I am seeking asylum now in Europe due to the fact I 
don't have relatives or friends in Europe to stay with before claiming our funds that made

 father before his death to your country for private investments etc.

investments now, and I am assured in me that you are a trustworthy person that can

good investments together, But if you already know a profitable business we can invest 
in please let me know also.
