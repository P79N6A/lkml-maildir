Ok, the FB_SIS driver _does_ work on this machine, but sends its output to
the external monitor connector (I see all but the leftmost characters,
which the monitor cannot fix), but sends garbage to the builtin screen.
Any simple way to fix this, or does it fall under the "SiS wont tell us
how to fix it" catagory? As noted, this seems to be the problem X has
with it too.
Cheers, Gavin Baker
