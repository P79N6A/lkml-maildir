Yeah,  you see, If you have about 100 Linux servers to maintain, part your own,
part installed by someone else, part standard installation, then this question
does
make sense too, but is still irrelevant to outcome which is needed "now, after few

principially wrong the whole setup of the question and path of your own actions
might be.
