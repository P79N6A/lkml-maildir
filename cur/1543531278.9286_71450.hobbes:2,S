We're saying the same thing: being out of swap implies being out of RAM.
If you're not out of RAM, the swap area is *empty*. On a Linux system
the swap space is almost never empty (unless it's 0-sized, of course)
because the kerner thinks it's a better idea to page-out some unused pages
to make room for more buffers/cache.
But paging is not "shuffle the memory around": you go either RAM -> disk
or disk -> RAM. In OOS situation, if a free page-frame is needed (because
of a page fault wants to do a "disk -> RAM" operation), AND none is 
available (so it's OOM, after all), you first need to do a "RAM -> disk",
which is impossible because swap is full. The problem occurs during
page-out.

So it doesn't make real difference. Everybody is used to write it's own
safe malloc() wrapper. The problem is: you accessed some page of yours,
and faulted. The kernel needs to page-in your data. To do that it needs
a free page-frame (RAM). There's none. So it looks for an used page-frame
that can be paged-out. It selects one. When it tries to page it out,
it fails, 'cause swap is full.  It kills a signal to you process.
How can you be sure that your signal handler it there, *in RAM*, and
won't page fault itself? Expecially if it runs some kind of garbage
collector (which is likely to touch most of your data pages)?
The whole problem arose not at malloc() time, but later when you're
accessing your address space. A page that has been previously allocated
to you (in RAM) when you wrote it, and later (you not being notified)
paged-out to swap.
