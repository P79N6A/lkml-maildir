Well, if the 2.4 version hasn't been ported by 2.6.24, maybe we'll check
back in *another* 4 years when we're up to 2.6.48.  There's a limit to
how much "eventually" we should drag along.
We (especially Adrian) remove stuff from the kernel *all the time* with the
notation "If anybody wants to get this hook back, it's easy enough to re-add it
when an actual user shows up".  I don't see why iBCS should be treated any
differently.
