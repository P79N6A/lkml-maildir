It was suggested to me in an earlier patch set to move RESERVE_HOTADD to
Kconfig.  I can make it a non-user option.  It seems that MEMORY_HOTPLUG
is a user options so I figured why not make RESERVE one as well.  Also I
don't think people should use reserve with sparsmem.

  srat.c as it stands is very reserve specific (understandably).
Changing found_add_area to reserve_add_area is extra change help the var
names be more clear with the sharing of the code path as to what is
happening.  reserve_add_area is used as a switch for the reserve path. 
Since the logic of the code was changing I thought it would be a good
time to change the name to help the clarity of the code. 
  If you see this as a waste/unneeded I will revert the name change.  
Thanks for the comments,
