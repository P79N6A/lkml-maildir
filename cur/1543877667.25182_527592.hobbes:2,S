As we discussed before, this obviously has a lot in common with my
walk_page_range code.
The major difference and one your above description seems to be
missing the important detail of why it's doing this:

..which is mentioned here:

But I'm not sure what the use case is that wants filling in the page
table..? If both modes really make sense, perhaps a flag could unify
these differences.

I'd gotten the impression that these sorts of typedefs were out of
fashion.

Seems a bit awkward to pass mm all the way down the tree just for this
quirk. Which is a bit awkward as it means that whether or not a lock
is held in the callback is context dependent.
smaps, clear_ref, and my pagemap code all use the callback at the
pmd_range level, which a) localizes the pte-level locking concerns
with the user b) amortizes the indirection overhead and c)
(unfortunately) makes the user a bit more complex.
We should try to measure whether (b) actually makes a difference.

I was about to say this do/while format seems a bit non-idiomatic for
page table walkers, but then I looked at the code in mm/memory.c and
realized the stuff I've been hacking on is the odd one out.
