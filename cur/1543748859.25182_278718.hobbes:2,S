[The following is all done booting into 0.7.32-19, interrupt scheduling
and priorities unchanged from the defaults]
I'm using PREEMPT_DESKTOP. I don't know how to force the kernel to not
thread hardirqs. What I did (maybe the same thing?) is to boot single
user, then turn off /proc/sys/kernel/hardirq_preempt, and then start the
network. It works (the network). And then I tried the same thing with
hardirq_preempt=1 and still worked when booting single user... :-(
So, these are the interrupts after booting single user:
           CPU0       
  0:      36426    IO-APIC-edge  timer  0/35956
  1:        143    IO-APIC-edge  i8042  0/143
  4:          0    IO-APIC-edge  KGDB-stub  0/0
  8:          1    IO-APIC-edge  rtc  0/1
  9:          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi  0/0
 12:        100    IO-APIC-edge  i8042  0/100
 14:         26    IO-APIC-edge  ide0  1/24
 17:         59   IO-APIC-level  libata, libata  0/59
 20:       1462   IO-APIC-level  libata  0/1462
 21:          0   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd, uhci_hcd, uhci_hcd, uhci_hcd,
uhci_hcd  0/0
NMI:       7544 
LOC:      36254 
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
Here's the extra one I have after I start the network
 16:          7   IO-APIC-level  eth0  0/7
(network works). I then telinit 3, no changes in interrupts (except for
the count numbers), network continues working. 
I then telinit 5 and the network dies. This is the added interrupt:
 11:          0    IO-APIC-edge  radeon@PCI:1:0:0  0/0
I tried repeating the whole thing but going through all the services in
the transition from level 3 to level 5 one by one, and nothing happened
to the network so it must be X. I then rebooted into single user,
started the network and loaded the radeon kernel module alone and the
network was not affected. 
So, this is what I get in dmesg when I go into level 5:
NET: Registered protocol family 10

Let me know if you still want the .config...
