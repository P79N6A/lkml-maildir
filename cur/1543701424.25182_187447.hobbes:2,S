hmm...
#ln tree1/sub/dir/file tree2/sub/dir/file
#watch_tree tree1 &
#do_something_to tree2/sub/dir/file
A dnotify can potentially know about open, chown, chmod,
utimes and possibly link of the files by watching the paths
and cwd; meaning it won't know about alternate paths.  How
is it to know about read, write, fchown, fchmod and
truncate?
Perhaps someone else has a more fertile imagination but
short of looking up all the file inode numbers of the tree
in question and watching that whole list this sounds futile.
