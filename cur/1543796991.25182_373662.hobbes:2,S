The helper is not necessary, I think.
What we can do is to skip blank pages while writing the image and only use
place holders for them in metadata.  Then we can make them blank again
when we load the image into memory.
Still, this would require some considerable changes in the swap-handling
part of swsusp and lots of testing.
Greetings,
Rafael
