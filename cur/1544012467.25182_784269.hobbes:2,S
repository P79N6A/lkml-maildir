Many of the RAID appliance/subsystem vendors format the disks to 520 or
528
Bytes/sector, but expose 512-byte blocks to the user.  The ECC logic is
done
by the firmware ... or if this ever gets implemented, would be done by
the
LINUX kernel.  True there are some issues with many of the cheap
consumer
class drives not supporting anything but 512-byte blocks, but we
shouldn't
code to lowest common denominator.
With 1TB SATA disks selling for $99, then it isn't as if the extra 8-16
bytes
for ECC on the disk drive is going to be a problem.
