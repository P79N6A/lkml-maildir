No, but I solved the problem yesterday at 3:00 in the night! A recompiled
kernel (this time: 2.2.19) did the trick. However, the previous kernels I
compiled with different options were not installed correctly. To be 
precise: I have a small /boot partition where I store the kernels to
boot, but unfortunately make bzlilo was not aware of that fact and so
running lilo always installed the old broken 2.2.17! 
Maybe the error had something to do with other problems mentioned
about a VIA KT133 bug (data corruption...something) but I am quite
happy that I can work again!
Bye,
Olaf
