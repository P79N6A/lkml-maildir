Confirmed. I tried both pre2 and pre3
2.4.7-pre2 + 00_ksoftirqd-7 + your last "bug" patch --> boot failed
2.4.7-pre3 + 00_ksoftirqd-7 + your last "bug" patch --> boot ok
BTW, is there some kind of doc regarding all the patches in
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels ?
Especially, what each of them is meant for.
Best regards,
Thibaut
