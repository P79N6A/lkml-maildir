Just a thought, but maybe double-buffering can help?

Making this RFC rather useful.
What we need now is an implementation, which should be easy.
Maybe something on these lines:
<< in ext3_ordered_write_end >>
  if (current->soft_sync & 1)
    return ext3_writeback_write_end;
<< in ext3_ordered_writepage >>
  if (current->soft_sync & 2)
    return ext3_writeback_writepage;
<< in ext3_sync_file >>
  if (current->soft_sync & 4)
    return ret;
<< in ext3_file_write >>
  if (current->soft_sync & 8)
    return ret;
As you can see soft_sync is masked and bits are ordered by importance.
It would be neat if somebody interested could cook-up a patch.
Thanks!
