Ok, from what i read, there are many-many similarities in objective but i think
that i take a different aproach in the solution
This is a mod for modular exponentiation only, and this is specific and simple,
cut-down and (as much as possible) overhead free. I don't use gpg structs and /or 
other code, don't depend anyhow on userland, don't care about elf formats, 
or where the signature is, or key management, i leave those up to the others 
to design 
this is just modular exponentiation as simple as can be
