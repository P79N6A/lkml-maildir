All of my complaints are real.  But yes I do think a reasonable
case can be made for merging them.  In several of the worst cases
simply calling memset before initializing the page is probably
sufficient to remove a test later on.
As that code sits right now you need way too much global context
to understand what is going on.  It is the kind of code that cause
obviously correct patches to fail, and I'm clever enough to know
clever code is very dangerous. :)
So before I get back to that I will probably look and see if there
is some more heavy lifting I can do to make that code less of a land mine.

Ok. I will take a look.
Having any patches merged on a simple request for comments was a bit of a surprise :)
