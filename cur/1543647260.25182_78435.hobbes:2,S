Besides which, I think it is ridiculous that one would have to download
and install a "kernel configurator" just to build a kernel.  Current
minimum requirements for compiling the thing are gcc, binutils and GNU
make.  The kernel can't very well ship a copy of any of those, because
(a) they're huge and (b) they're useful for many things other than
building kernels.  Roman's library is neither.
(And no, "modutils" isn't a counterexample - you can build, install and
run a kernel without it.)
