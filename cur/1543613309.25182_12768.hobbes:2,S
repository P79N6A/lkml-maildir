Oh, my! I am ashamed. I totally missed the fact that default idle task
alredy halts CPU. I must be getting old :(

Unfortunately, this patch does not works as I'd expected. This patch
does hide systime, but it does not cool CPU. With this patch system runs
4C hotter than it run when I replaced apm_do_idle() with apm_cpu_idle()
in original apm.c
I'll try to get a closer look at weekend; any hints how to debug it are
welcome.

Well, my vendor is ASUS and it is notorious for never answering bug
reports from mere mortals. I also do not know how important Linux market
is for them and Windows runs fine with ACPI (and Linux with ACPI does
not have this problem as well. But I run Mandrake and they currently do
not want to enable ACPI for different reasons). But I'll try anyway.
Thank you
