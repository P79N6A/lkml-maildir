It would be grand to fix this (it's, umm, three years since I promised to
do so a few days later), but I'm not quite satisfied by your patch as is.

You're adding a little overhead to every set_page_dirty, when the vast
majority (ordinary writes) don't need it: their mctime update is already
well taken care of.  (Or should we be deleting the code that does that?
I think I'd rather not dare.)
Perhaps it's so little overhead that it's not worth worrying about.
But writes to a file which happens to be mapped readonly at that time
are liable to end up with too late a last mctime on the file, aren't
they (if the readonly mapping is unmapped later)?
I think you'd do better to target those places where set_page_dirty is
called on a mapped page - and do the file_update_time at that point -
or as near to that point as is sensible/permitted given the locking
(vma->vm_file gives you the file without needing inode_update_time).
Calling your inode_update_time from unmap_file_vma is probably unwise:
at present we may have preemption disabled there, and it's not clear
what ->dirty_inode might get up to.  Calling it from the vm_file case
of remove_vma would be safer.
Peter Zijlstra has patches relating to dirty mmaps in the -mm tree
at present: I need to take a look at those, and I'll see if it would
make sense to factor in this mctime issue on top of those - you may
want to do the same.
In the course of trying that, I'm likely to discover exactly why you
made the decisions you did, and arrive at commending your solution.
