It seems like you stuck with existing toys forever, which can somewhat
indicate that your learning factor is extremely low
History knows many applications of such behavior. In short, it stops
improvements and breaks progress. And in a few words more, you can now
compile linux 2.2.(something) with egcs (something), and you will be able to
live in underground cave with stoneage tools *years* from now too.
