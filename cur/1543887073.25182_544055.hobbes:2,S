Subject: New version of shutdown?

 I've just shut down -rc1 on my ppc64, and got a big scary message
from the following code in libata-scsi.c:
ata_dev_printk(qc->dev, KERN_WARNING,
	"DISK MIGHT NOT BE SPUN DOWN PROPERLY. "
	"UPDATE SHUTDOWN UTILITY\n");
 So, I went to 
http://linux-ata.org/shutdown.html,
 but as far as I
can make out, every distro is expected to reinvent the wheel by
altering shutdown themselves.  For those of us who build from
source, (e.g sysvinit-2.86) is there an example of an up-to-date
released version of shutdown ?
