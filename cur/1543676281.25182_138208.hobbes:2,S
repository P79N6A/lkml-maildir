Subject: [PATCH][I2C] fix unsafe usage of list_for_each in i2c-core

Hi,
i2c-core.c contains 2 loops that iterate over the list of the clients attached 
to an adapter and detaches them. Detaching the clients will actually remove 
them from the list the loop is iterating over. Therefore the 
list_for_each_safe() method has to be used.
