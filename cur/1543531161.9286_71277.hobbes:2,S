Howdy,
a question from someone who is just entering Linux
newbiehood...  ;O)
I am in the process of porting a char driver from
kernel version 2.0.x to version 2.2.12.  While building
the driver against the new kernel, gcc tells me that
"struct no longer has a member timeout" (this is struct
current).
I believe I found a code sample that shows how to deal
with this build error however, I am wondering, where one
would look for any kind of information that documents
what happend to struct current between versions 2.0.x and
2.2.x?
Also, I am wondering if there is a document that talks
about how file_operations' select has been replaced by a
poll.
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks,
Paul
