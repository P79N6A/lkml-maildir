Hi,  Aaron
Nothing, just nothing...
That's final messages I see and nothing after it.
First 3-4 minutes I can still use "three fingers trick" :-) to reboot my
poor machine,
(so I have such an impression that kernel is like waiting for something
saying neither "yes" nor "no")
But If I make "Ctrl+C" - I can't account for anything but only for Reset
button :-(
That's all
Regards,
Mike
