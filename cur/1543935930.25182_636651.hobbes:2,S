by 'read graphics drivers' do you mean direct framebuffer access? In any 
case, a driver (or even userspace) can use cflush just fine, it's an 
unprivileged instruction. But this is about the ioremap() implementation 
using cflush instead of WBINVD, and that is a slowpath and is up to the 
kernel anyway - i'm not aware of many high-frequency ioremap() users, so 
robustness concerns control the policy here. So could you please explain 
your point in more detail?
