You clearly have been using Microsoft Windows (NT/9x) to much.  that
Microsoft OS does need regular re-boots, but there is no reason to re-boot
a Linux system just to re-boot it.  I can understand turning it off when
you aren't there without a UPS, but when you get a UPS, just leave it up
24/7. There is "almost" nothing that a re-boot can fix that cant be fixed
by using other tools like ifconfig, etc...  It is not uncommon to see
uptimes well in excess of 70 days.  I have heard of Linux 1.2.x systems
staying up for longer then a year ( and by this time, this might include
2.0.x systems also)
See you
