You're right, we have been discussing this privately and agreed we were both
talking about higher numbers ; Robert seems to have a good experience of very
high traffic ;-)

Why not ?
I've often been doing this to check the reliability of the network layer of
kernels that I distribute. I often use Tux for this, because it can easily
sustain 10k hits/s during months. But Tux is not in mainstream kernel, we have
to use other tools. Since I'm working on a task scheduler, I may soon have the
base to rewrite my injecter and a fake server to do these tests on mainstream
kernels. I think that several tools already exist for this. You can take a look
at the C10K project to find links. I don't have the URL in mind, google is your
friend.
Cheers,
Willy
