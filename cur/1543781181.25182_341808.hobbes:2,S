I actually read the thread, but patches with useless descriptions
like your previous one cannot be applied in general because you cannot expect
that people later looking at the <VCS system of the week> logs 
know about some obscure thread months or years before. Or rather
the person who applied it would need to write a better description
on his own, which is not their job.
My general feeling about the change is that it risks breaking programs
and doesn't seem to have any compelling advantages,
so unless there is a bug demonstrated I wouldn't apply it.
