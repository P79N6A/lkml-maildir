I'm worried about crap being pushed into libata, that's all.
Besides does current situation of ALSA and OSS bring any bells?

By reading linux-ide ML you will see that actually

Are you familiar with background discussions before Alan started

personal attacks and replying to eny post relating to IDE with either
FUD or "IDE driver is going away"...

my work...
