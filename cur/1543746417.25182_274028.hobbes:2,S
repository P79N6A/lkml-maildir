Of course you could do the monkeys on the keyboard thing and
eventually have something that shows it's not impossible. The
problem is that an IP address needs to be associated with that
hardware address. ARP is fundamental for any peer-to-peer
communication on Ethernet. Its even used in DECNET and NETBIOS,
although called RIP.
