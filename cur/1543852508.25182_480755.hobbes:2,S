This works for me in should want to known:
#include <linux/moduleparam.h>
int set_module_params(void)
{
   extern struct kernel_param __start___param[], __stop___param[];
   char module_params[]="rtc-ds1307.force=0,0x68";
   parse_args("hard module params", module_params, __start___param,
          __stop___param - __start___param, NULL);
   return 0;
}
arch_initcall(set_module_params);
