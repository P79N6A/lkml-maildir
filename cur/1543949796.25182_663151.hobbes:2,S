Oh well, I guess I'm the one with strange taste he
re.  My logic is that the only thing below the block layer is the driver
which requested size adjustment.  This means residual bytes calculation
is pushed to low level drivers which isn't anything major but still.
Anyways, I'll review FUJITA's modified patch.
Thanks.
