Hi, Thanks for your comments.

It's hard to prove that we can't implement the process-aggregation only
in user-space, but there are some difficulties on imaplementation, I think.
For example, each process must have a tag or another identifier to explain
what process-aggregation does it belong, but kernel does not support thoes
kind of information, currently. Thus, we can't guarantee associating one
process-aggregation with one process.
# /proc/<uid>/loginuid might be candidate, but it's out of original purpose.
We might be able to make alike system, but is it hard to implement strict
process-aggregation without any kernel supports?
I think that well thought out kernel-modification is better than ad-hoc
implementation on user-space.
Thanks.
