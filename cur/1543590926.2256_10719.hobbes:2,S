Your patch may allow bdflush or some other task to submit IO if kswapd is
looping mad --- but it will not avoid kswapd from eating all the CPU
time, which is the _main_ problem. 
If we avoid kswapd from doing such a thing (which is what we should try to
fix in the first place), there is no need for your patch.
