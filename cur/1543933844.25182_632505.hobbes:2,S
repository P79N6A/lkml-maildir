Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Since first posting I have updated the patch like this:
o Fixed a few bugs shown up by more extensive testing
o Avoided one ifdef group
o Added a few more comments
o Removed and/or updated a few comments
On top of that I did a few more patches:
Sam Ravnborg (5):
      x86: unification of arch/x86/Makefiles
      x86: share more options between 32 and 64 bit build
      x86: biarch support for 32 bit builds beautified
      x86: teach vdso to clean
      x86: teach vdso to clean
The resulting diffstat:
 arch/x86/Makefile      |  244 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-
 arch/x86/Makefile_32   |  181 -----------------------------------
 arch/x86/Makefile_64   |  141 ----------------------------
 arch/x86/boot/Makefile |    4 +-
 arch/x86/vdso/Makefile |    2 +
 5 files changed, 243 insertions(+), 329 deletions(-)
I'm pretty satisfied with the result.
But I hope someone can look into the cpu specific stuff
and merge the remaining bits from 64 bit to the currently 32 bit
only Makefile_32.cpu file.
This will benefit readability and UML I think.
The patches are made on top of the mm branch of the x86 tree.
Patches follows.
