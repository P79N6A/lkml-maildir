Yep... I had 'less' break too (you will find 'man' is broke also, rolling on 
from that).
It turns out to be a problem (typo?) in  /etc/udev/rules.d/udev.rules
Try changing:
# pty devices
KERNEL="pty[p-za-e][0-9a-f]*", NAME="pty/m%n", SYMLINK="%k"
KERNEL="tty[p-za-e][0-9a-f]*", NAME="tty/s%n", SYMLINK="%k"
to:
# pty devices
KERNEL="pty[p-za-e][0-9a-f]*", NAME="pty/m%n", SYMLINK="%k"
KERNEL="tty[p-za-e][0-9a-f]*", NAME="pty/s%n", SYMLINK="%k"
(change is in second line tty -> pty)
As to the missing /dev/ entries - remember you are using udev now - they 
appear 'on the fly' as and when you plug something in - ensure you have set 
'hotplug' to start.
