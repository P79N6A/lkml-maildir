It's not even that. There are two things that can happen:
case 1:
  intr_mask = 1;
            <interrupt occurs and is deferred>
  intr_mask = 0;
  /* intr_pending is already set and CLI is in effect */
  if(intr_pending)
case 2:
  intr_mask = 1;
  intr_mask = 0;
            <interrupt occurs and is processed>
  /* intr_pending remains cleared */
  if(intr_pending)
As this is all about local interrupts, it's all on a single CPU and
out of order issues aren't visible..

..unless the compiler is doing the reordering, of course.

I was actually worrying about the case where the interrupt came in
"late". But I don't think it's a problem there either.

It can only be worse than the current situation by the amount of time
it takes to defer an interrupt once. On average, it'll be a lot
better as most critical sections are -tiny-.
