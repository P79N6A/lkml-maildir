The point is that you have added blk_cleanup_queue() to the ide-disk
driver release function and it is perfectly fine for IDE layer to send requests
after unloading ide-disk driver.

Yes, that is why failing old requests is a preferred solution.

Yes, we should just fail all the requests if the device is not present.
[ What do you mean by the old physical device, old 'ide_drive_t *'? ]
