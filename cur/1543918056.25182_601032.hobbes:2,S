Not so good. But how could it work on the above archs, surely the
padding (and thuse resulting size of the structure) is different?

Fine with me.

And ditto for u16 and u32, I gather? If you notice, it's not padding in
front of the u64 that bites me here, it's before the u32.

OK, I will adapt.

I was pretty sure that we modified start_lba and end_lba and copied
those back as well, so it was a conscious decision to just copy
everything for safety. But checking we only do mangle and copy back
->name, so your suggestion is a good one.
