Have you checked that the drive is running the latest firmware release
for it?  Bad firmware causes all sorts of problems.
What other device is it sharing the cable with?  Which is master and
which is slave?
Is it a 40 or 80 conductor ide cable?  Most 8x+ DVD writers want an 80
conductor as far as I know (at least to operate at full speed).
