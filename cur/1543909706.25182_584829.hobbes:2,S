This would work well, although I would give write permissions to a group
so the entire dir wouldn't need to be re-ACLed when a user is added. I
may give this a shot; I've been avoiding ACLs because they have always
sounded incomplete/not useful, but the inheritance aspect sounds rather
nice.

This is ZFS' bailiwick, no? I'd love to see the licensing issues
resolved, because if it can control level of redundancy on a
per-file/directory basis, I would be a very happy man.

This might be pushing it, but hey, we *are* talking about the future here.

I'd really love to see distributed storage not suck. Everything I've
seen requires myriad daemons and ugly configuration.

Now you're just being silly ;)
