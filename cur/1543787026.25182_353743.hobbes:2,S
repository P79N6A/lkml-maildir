No way!  It needs to work the other way: allow the debugger to
short-circuit a signal for performance reasons if it wants to.  Ptrace
is supposed to report all signals and debuggers expect it to do so.
It'd be pretty confusing if, say, you were trying to debug the SIGSEGV
handler in an application which did this.
