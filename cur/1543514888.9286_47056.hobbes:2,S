Hello,
I'm wrapping up the user space mapping functions in bttv.c into a
single set of functions for a kernel patch, and I noticed that it uses
remap_page_range, but not zeromap_page_range for creating and
destroying the mmaped space. 
These functions seem to be symmetric, and so I would assume that if
remap_page_range is called to create the mapping, that when the file
is closed zeromap_page_range should also be called. In my application
it's possible that the user process calling mmap would survive the
close.
Or does it not matter, ie the map will be cleaned out when the memory
is freed?
