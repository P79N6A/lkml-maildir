It looks like a lot of data may have been initialized in the
newer kernel, i.e. int barf = 0; or struct vomit = {0,}.
If they just declared the static data, it would end up in
.bss which is allocated at run-time (and zeroed) and is
not in the kernel image.
You might want to check this out. There is 51204 - 39152 = 12,052
more data, but 134260 - 78896 = 55350 less bss.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
