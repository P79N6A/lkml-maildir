The call
	fd = dup2(fd1,fd2);
is equivalent to
	close(fd2);
	fd = fcntl(fd1, F_DUPFD, fd2);
except that
- if fd1==fd2 and both are valid, then dup2() returns this
  without closing fd2
- if fd1 is invalid, dup2 returns -1 without closing fd2
So, yes, it looks like there is no provision for returning
close() errors here.
