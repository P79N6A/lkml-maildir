NetWare Partitions always make a copy of the last valid partition table
(boot sector)  at sector offset (1) from the start of a NetWare
partition.  MS-DOS also used to do this as well (up to 6.22), though I
do not know for certain if Linux fat is set up to provide this.  You can
scan a sector at a time and look for 0x55AA at the end of each sector on
the disk and try to find an old copy of the partition table.  This
signature will occupy the last two bytes of the boot sector.  If you
find this pattern, then copy this sector to sector 0 and see if your
partition table comes back.
