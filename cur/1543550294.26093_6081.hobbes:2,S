there's already a F_GETLK fcntl.  however, it's not entirely suitable
for use as a debugging tool since it dosen't report the blocked locks
and it might not find all the locks in force (or if it does,it could
take 2^64 calls to fcntl to find them all).
given an inode, it's trivial to find the locks in force on it (and the
locks blocked on the locks in force upon it).  the difficulty lies in
reporting this data to userspace.
if fcntl took a 4th argument specifying the length of the buffer, i'd
recommend a F_GETLKS fcntl.  a horrid work around for this would be that
the first 4 bytes of the buffer pointed to by the third argument of the
fcntl is the length of the buffer.
i'd appreciate anyone coming up with a nicer interface.  How do other
unices provide this information?  grovelling through /proc/kcore?
