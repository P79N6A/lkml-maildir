No no no
There are several sets of numbers here
Each ethernet DIX frame has a "protocol" (its the bits used for length
in 802.*). IEEE at least used to handle the assignment of those. On top
of that you have IP, IPX, etc with their own numbering agency.
As he said "ethernet protocol (it's below IP level)", those are the
protocol numbering bodies he wants, or to whomever it was delegated.
