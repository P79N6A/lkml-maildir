Hi!
I was poking around looking for information on CD or DVD Packet Writing,
  and came across 
http://packet-cd.sourceforge.net
.  It looks like it's
  inactive atm.
Have these patches been absorbed into the vanilla 2.6 kernels (I recall
  UDF write in the kernel config).  If not, where is current development
  at?  Where can I find more information?
Thanks!
-Joseph
