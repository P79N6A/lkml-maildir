normally, resume takes place _before_ the initramfs is entered. If your
swap device depends on a module that is loaded from initramfs, you are lost.
This patch (or the version in the kernel i am running right now at
least) still does this (resume early), but if it does not find a device,
it allows resume to be triggered from initramfs after the module is loaded.
Excerpt from dmesg on my machine (i did boot and not resume this time):

unfortunately the errors did not get caught by dmesg, but the first
error is -6 (no such device), later it is -22 (-EINVAL, no valid suspend
signature). This is in fact ok since i did not suspend before ;-)
Hope this helps (and the patch is working fine in my extended tests, it
could get some documentation on how to set it up since it is not totally
trivial. Hannes?).
