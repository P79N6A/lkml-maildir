kernel 2.2.1-ac4 :
i'm working with up to 2000 network connections, and getting
ENOBUFS on connect(). my study of kernel source sais "whenever
network code cannot allocate or free some buffer, it returns ENOBUFS".
how can i tune the kernel to make sure this doesn't happen so often ?
is there network specific vm stuff i can tune ?
any recommendation for /proc/sys/vm/freepages ?
thanks for your help.
andreas
