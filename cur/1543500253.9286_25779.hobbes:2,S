It seems to me that the mmap/MAP_SHARED locks_verify_locked() check
and fcntl_setlk() have no synchronization. For example, a process
invoking fcntl_setlk on a IS_MANDLOCK inode can check that it has
no i_mmap vma list, then go on and sleep later before queueing a
file_lock on the inode i_flock. Subsequently, an mmaper can come
in, invoke locks_verify_locked(), see no file_lock on the inode
i_flock, and succeed. The file locker can then wake up and also
return success.
Am I missing some synchronization lock/algorithm?
