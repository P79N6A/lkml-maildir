	What's "too big"?  We certainly don't specify 128MB, but we will
specify up to 1MB.
	When we have large cluster size filesystems, we've seen backups
with O_DIRECT-enabled versions of cp(1) and dd(1) go way faster than
when they read/write 4K at a time.  This matters to folks who have the
files open O_DIRECT by other processes and cannot trust the page cache.
At least, that's is how it was when we originally did this :-)

	Well, Christoph points out we already have a valid getattr()
that calls generic_fillattr() and then overloads our stat->blksize.  So
I think we're safe.  I don't think we need sb->s_blksize, but I'll defer
to Mark for the final say.
