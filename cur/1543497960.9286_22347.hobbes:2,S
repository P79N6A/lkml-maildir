Wrong.  It is (AFAIK) never correct for an MTA to use a From: address
for any purpose.  That's why majordomo inserts a "Return-path:
owner-linux-kernel-outgoing@vger" to every mail, and any MTA ignoring that
is broken.

Matti /is/ the list owner and the point of his message was to point out
that some brain-dead person behind a brain-dead MTA has broken their
linux-kernel subscription.
