Sure, glad to. If the 2.5 numbers are much worse than 2.4, somthing isn't
working as well, another problem, go have a beer to drown your sorrow. On
the other hand if it runs much better, you have done a great job and can
go have a beer to celebrate.
Seriously, I would read the reasonably smooth curve of values as good
sign, as opposed to "gets real badd and improves under more load" or
similar. And the fact that it stayed up, and presumably didn't eat all the
filesystems indicates that the system is getting more stable IDE.
One more thing, if you have been fighting bad machines for 15 hours and no
one is looking, it's time to go get a beer. And cashews, and cheddar. I am
out of here (as in where I am working right now, not my office).
