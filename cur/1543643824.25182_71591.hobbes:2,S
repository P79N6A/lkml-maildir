It is true that on x86 you have only 8192 different segment selectors
at a time. Nobody says you can't modify segment descriptors on demand.
If I'm not mistaken, Linux kernel does precisely this. It has per-CPU
allocated GDT entries, not per-task. So there is no limitation
unless you happen to have more than 1024 CPUs ;-).
