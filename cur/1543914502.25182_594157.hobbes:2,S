iSCSI does not do passive listens, only active connections to the
target.  But you're right, the port space is still shared between iSCSI
and the main stack.  We currently rely on user apps binding to the main
stack to reserve certain ephemeral ports, and telling the iSCSI driver
which ports to use.
