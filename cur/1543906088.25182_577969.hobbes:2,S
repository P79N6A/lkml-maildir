Not programs - people. 
When you want to debug a large complex system with multiple setuid
applications it can rapidly get quite unpleasant. If you
set /proc/sys/kernel/suid_dumpable to 2 and /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
then it becomes possible to get hold of all the core dumps and debug the
system as a whole. The system is not secure in this state but while you
are doing that kind of debug on a devel system its usually acceptable.
Secondly we don't break userspace interfaces except in extreme cases -
proc/sys/kernel/suid_dumpable is a user space interface
