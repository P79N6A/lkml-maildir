It isn't used anywhere:
erik@zurix:~/git/linux-2.6 > find . -name Kconfig | xargs grep EXTRANAME
[nothing]
If there is a use for EXTRANAME, it should be included in the
KERNELRELEASE variable in the top level Makefile. As long as all
package scripts use the KERNELRELEASE variable, everything will be
fine.
