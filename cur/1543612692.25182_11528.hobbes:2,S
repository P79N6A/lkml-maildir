I'd be interested in the results: it'd certainly be neater.  Another
option would be to use the per-cpu region pointer where architectures
currently hold smp_processor_id(), and derive the current CPU from the
per-CPU area instead of vice versa.

Yep... Someone Else's Problem 8)

It could possibly be done with linker tricks in vmlinux.lds, and yes,
definitely worth doing.

Hmm... I'm working on a rewrite, but the interface should stay the
same:
