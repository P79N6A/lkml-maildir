That works too.  I made a similar change in the consolidation patch.  This
was just meant to be a very simple stop gap fix, while the consolidation
bits bake in -mm before they go to Linus.  I prefer to leave it as is,
only so I don't have to respin the patches, but it's not that big a deal.
Either way, Linus should pick up one of the mips fixes.
thanks,
