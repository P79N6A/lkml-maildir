You have one of the 32bit models of the athlon64. (Basically a crippled athlon64)
(See proc/cpuinfo..)
cpu family      : 15
I've not heard reports of whether powernow-k8 works or not on these cpu's,
but it should if the cpu reports the powernow capability bits.
My suspicion is that for some reason, your cpu is booting at a low speed.
Are there any powernow/power management settings in the BIOS that change
this ?
