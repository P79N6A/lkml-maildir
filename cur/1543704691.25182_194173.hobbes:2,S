I tried to use kernel 2.6.0 (the SuSE binary RPM), and I found some
problems with USB.
In particular, my USB mouse stopped working when I plugged in my USB
storage (external hard disk),and the same happened when I
plugged/unplugged the AC adapter from my laptop (Acer Aspire 1300 - AMD
Athlon XP 1600+).
Simply removing and plugging in again the mouse solved the problem, but
it's not a nice behaviour.
