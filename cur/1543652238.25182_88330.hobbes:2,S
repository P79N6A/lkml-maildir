that has still the bugs in 2.4.19 and all previous 2.4 that I found and
that I fixed first with an limited patch, not complete, and then Jens
fixed it competely after I showed him the bugs while explaining him why
I did the first limited patch (then Jens's patch gone in 2.4.20pre).
so a 8192 there, isn't comparable to a 8192 in 2.4.20rc, Jens was of
course aware and just lowered it to 2048 but that is probably still more
than a 8192 in previous 2.4, it would be possible to do the math to
calculate the exact value in some common case but I guess we want a sane
default, not necessairly the exact same behaviour, so I guess
benchmarking is more useful than doing the math to calculate the exact
new value to get the exact same behaviour.
