Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to report this; there aren't
any maintainers listed for the Linux Framebuffer stuff or mention of a 
framebuffer specific mailing list anywhere in the documentation.
The problem is that I have an ATI Expert@Play 8MB graphics card (it has a 
Rage Pro Turbo PCI chip), and the ATYFB driver locks the whole machine
when it tries to initialise it. Looking at the driver, it does seem to
support this chip.
Enabling debug mode in the driver and booting with two graphics cards
reveals (copied by hand so might not be perfect):
atyfb: 3D RAGE PRO (PQFP, PCI) [0x4750 rev 0x7c] 512K RESV, 230MHz PLL,
100 Mhz MCLK
BUS_CNTL DAC_CNTL MEM_CNTL EXT_MEM_CNTL CRTC_GEN_CNTL DSP_CONFIG
DSP_ON_OFF
80000101 06010080 00081838 00000000 04000000 00000000 00000000
PLL cc cc 24 df f6 04 00 fd 8e 9e 65 05 40 00 00 00
The machine is totally locked after this point; magic sysrq does nothing
and the only thing left to do is hit the BRS. This is with a 2.3.3 kernel,
but the same thing happened with 2.2.9. The card works in text mode and
with the VGA16 FB driver, but I haven't tried VESAFB yet. This is with a
Uniprocessor machine. I also tried passing "vga=792" as per the
Framebuffer-HOWTO, but that only changed the colour of the vertical lines
displayed when it crashes from green to grey.
Any ideas? I'd really like to get this working, as the only reason I
bought a new graphics card is that I wanted one which had a Framebuffer
driver (for my work on the Nano-X project). Is anyone else successfully
using this card with the ATYFB driver?
