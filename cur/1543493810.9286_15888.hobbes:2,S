That's basically a case of changing the value of HZ in the relevant
header file.

The obvious problem is that the clock will wrap round faster if it's
ticking at a higher rate. I believe this is being looked into by some
of the senior kernel hackers at the moment, for various reasons.
Another problem may be that some drivers have a hidden assumption that
the kernel HZ setting is 100, although I would expect any such to be
located in the arch/*/ tree as the Alpha port uses HZ = 1024 rather
than HZ = 100.
There could be others though - your proposal is pretty much uncharted
territory...
Best wishes from Riley.
