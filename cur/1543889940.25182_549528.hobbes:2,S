The MTU checks are self-explanatory. Just a comment above the function
stating that it tries to find out whether a packet needs to be
refragmented because it was defragmented by IPv4 connection tracking
and exceeds the MTU should be enough.

As I said, I don't think we should account for the VLAN header overhead,
the VLAN code itself doesn't even do it. And we should exclude packets
that don't have a connection tracking reference attached since we are
only undoing the damage connection tracking did by defragmenting it
and should avoid fragmenting other packets as good as possible.

It looks OK. But there is another problem, ip_fragment doesn't care
about the PPPoE overhead and produces a packet that will be too large
after restoring the PPPoE header. A second __fake_rtable that accounts
for the PPPoE overhead could probably fix that ..

Sure :)
