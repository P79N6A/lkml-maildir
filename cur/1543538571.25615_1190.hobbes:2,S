There are two things that need testing:
1- If there is a vga card and no mda, does the mdacon driver really not
   detect an mda card.
2- If on mda card, the tests do not "mess up the cursor" as Edward Betts
   reports on the original tests (which I changed a little). 
Any report should include the exact type of vga card or mda card (if can
be said).
