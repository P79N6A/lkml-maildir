This should really be a FAQ.
The problem is that you don't reduce any potential vulnerabilities at
all.  For every buffer overflow exploit out there you can modify it and
produce a version which will work against a non-exec stack page on an
x86.  It is not hard.  I was actually considering producing a "Smashing
the Stack for Fun and Profit, Part II: Non-Exec Stacks" text to show just
how easy it really is.  For now, I suggest you check out the VULN-DEV
archives -- a few very helpful people on that list walked me through how
to produce non-exec stack exploits.
If a non-exec stack ever got accepted into the kernel, then exploit
writers would simply start coding for non-exec stacks.  The end result is
that you would gain precisely nothing.  And what you would lose is that
you would have broken the x86 API -- for nothing.  So, yes, there is a
drawback, and no you don't reduce any vulnerabilities.  Linus has already
rejected such patches for this reason.  Check out the Libsafe
documentation for a little bit of background and references.
