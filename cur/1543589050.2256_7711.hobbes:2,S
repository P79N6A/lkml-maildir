This is just the label as defined by the entries in the top-level
Makefile, eg:
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 4
SUBLEVEL = 3
EXTRAVERSION = -ac5

You can edit the extraversion value if you want to label your smp kernels

You'll probably find you _have_ compiled an SMP kernel - see what
/proc/cpuinfo says, for example.
