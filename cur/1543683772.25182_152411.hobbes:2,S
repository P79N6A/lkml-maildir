Setting elevator=deadline results in wine+galciv loading without the 
horrible long pauses but there is still chugging and while the AVIs 
play, the rest of Gnome is unresponsive (ie can't switch windows by 
clicking etc) though I can switch to Alt-F1 virtual terminal. Still not 
as good as 260-test-2-vanilla
