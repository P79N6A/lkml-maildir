that's the regular spinlock case but it has nothing to do with the big
kernel lock during smp_call_function. holding the big kernel lock while
broadcasting the IPI with smp_call_function is perfectly legal. Infact
if something it's safer (and it can't explain any deadlock), and since
it's a so low performance path, where scalability doesn't matter,
leaving the BKL around that code can be acceptable.
The only illegal thing is to call smp_call_function with _local_irqs_
disabled (as Andrew noted above). the big kernel lock doesn't matter for
the smp_call_function callers.

the *real* bug IMHO is that machine_restart isn't shutting down the
other cpus properly in smp, it has nothing to do with lock_kernel in
kernel/, the bug is in arch/. Dropping the big kernel lock in kernel/
can hide the bug, but it will showup again later in any other spinlock.
The problem is that machine_restart in arch/s390 (and arch/i386 too) can
easily hang a cpu in the IPI handler while it had zillon of spinlocks
held, that may later interfere with the main "reboot" cpu.
So at the very least a better fix than the one that drops the big kernel
lock from kernel/ is to execute current->lock_depth = -1 before entering
the infinite loop in the arch/ code.
A real fix would be to use the unplug cpu framework to allow all cpus to
reach the quiescent point, in this case it's easily doable even w/o
using RCU and w/o the pluggable cpu framework in 2.4, by simply spawning
a kernel thread bind to interesting cpu, and having this kernel thread
setting the bitflag after it become runnable (cut and pasting the
spawn_ksoftirqd will do the trick). The kernel thread will only execute
the infinite loop then. Hanging a cpu forever in a IPI is simply
deadlock prone for all other cpus, and that's the real bug.
