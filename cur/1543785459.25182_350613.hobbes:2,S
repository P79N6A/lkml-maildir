Yep. We've got atomic_add, atomic_sub, atomic_inc, atomic_dec,
atomic_inc_return, atomic_add_return, atomic_dec_return, atomic_sub_return
to start with.
Not only that, but we can probably emulate all the atomic_ operations
with atomic_cmpxchg, not just atomic_inc_not_zero.
Roman: any ideas about what you would prefer? You'll notice
atomic_inc_not_zero replaces rcuref_inc_lf, which is used several times
in the VFS.
Thanks,
Nick
