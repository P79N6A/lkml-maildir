Hi,
Mostly for my own use, I prepared two kernel RPM's with Ext3 in them.
They are totally basic:  kernel + ext3 patch, config based on Red Hat
i386-smp config files.  They include an RPM for e2fsprogs based on
Stephen's code.
I am running them (very) happily.
Versions:
2.2.19 + 0.0.7a
2.4.5  + 0.0.6
PLEASE USE THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK - THEY CONTAIN EXPERIMENTAL FILE SYSTEM
CODE.
The RPMS's can be found at:
ftp://ftp.clusterfilesystem.com/pub/ext3
Have a good day!
