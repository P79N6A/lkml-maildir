Hello,
here my last patch of LinuxPPS.
Main differences from old versions is that now (finally) each PPS
source is a dedicated char device!
This thanks to an agreement with NTP people who suggested to me how to
interpret RFC 2783 in such a way even a dedicated char device is now
RFC complain.
Please, take a look at the code and report all suggestions and/or
needed modifications for kernel inclusion so I can provide a final
patch.
Ciao,
Rodolfo
