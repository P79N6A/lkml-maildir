Yeah, but Linus stating his position about a license doesn't mean diddly.
The kernel is licensed under a license, that license is a contract that
people enter into.  To the extent that it is enforceable, that license
determines what happens, Linus can't retroactively decide to interpret
the license a different way.  The license can't enforce things which
the law doesn't allow.  In particular, the law understands a concept of
a boundary.  And Linus' comments notwithstanding, modules are a pretty
clear boundary.  Even the GPL acks this, it knows that anything which
is clearly separable is not covered.
