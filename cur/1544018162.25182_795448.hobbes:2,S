I should have replied to this email :-)
Yeah, I'm working on making wakeup latency tracer work with non rt tasks.
The "wakeup" tracer will now trace all tasks where as a new "wakeup_rt" 
tracer will only trace rt tasks. I did it for rt tasks only because it 
only records the highest latency wake ups and the non rt tasks were always 
bigger than the rt tasks which made what I was tracing useless (the rt 
scheduling).
But by not having an option for all tasks, it makes the wakeup tracer 
useless for everyone else ;-)
