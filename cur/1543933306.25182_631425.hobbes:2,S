just to be clear, i'm not complaining about the quality of the
document above, but when i got started with git, what i really wanted
was a list of what i (as a simple, non-developer user) could do once i
cloned a repository.
to that end, i put together my own little reference list of git
commands.  for example, i collected ways to examine my repository --
git commands like branch, tag, log/shortlog, what-changed, show, grep,
blame, that sort of thing.  exactly the kind of stuff a new user might
want to know about, even without the ability to change anything.
just my $0.02.
