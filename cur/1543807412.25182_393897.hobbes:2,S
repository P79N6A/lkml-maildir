That you placed the namespaces in a separate structure from task_struct.
That part seems completely unnecessary, that and the addition of a
global id in a completely new namespace that will be a pain to virtualize
when it's time comes.

It is already in sync.  When the only interesting target is inside of
a cluster it is trivial to handle.  In addition frequently there is
only one job on a given machine at a time so there is no other
interesting user of UIDs.

The requirement is that for every global identifier you have a
namespace where you will not have a conflict in definition when you
restore that identifier.  (Either that or you have to update all
references to that identifier which is usually to hideous to take
seriously)
Virtualization has nothing to do with it.  It is all about
non-conflicting names.  The kernel already has everything virtualized.

If you have different pointers for each one that is sane.  I meant in
the api.  I did not see patches 4/5 and 5/5.  But I presumed since
you allocated a great global structure everything was turned on
off with that.

My not seeing your user space api is one of the problems with incomplete
patches which seem to plague this conversation.
