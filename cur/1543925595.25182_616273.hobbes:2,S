You miss the point that we want people to be able to use Linux in such 
situations.
There are basically two choices:
- Either tell them code won't get merged and offer some degree of API
  stability in exchange or
- allow all code with >= 1 users to enter the kernel. [1]
With the current development model (and the mere amount of changes 
merged), the first choice is not possible.
The only reason for not merging it [1] would be if it would be 
unmaintained and bitrot, but considering that David is already doing a 
good job at maintaining the frv port that's not an issue here.
