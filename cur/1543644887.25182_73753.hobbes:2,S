yep. This is the hardest kind of bugs to fix, since the oops (or a lkcd
crash dump) would be almost totally useless in these cases. I'm quite
relaxed about the core, I would look into either scsi driver or e1000
first.
While I got good reports about qla drivers, I'm not sure how many people
is testing the e1000 in pre10aa4, that's an old driver, 4.2.x, the new
one in mainline 2.4.20 is 4.3.15. So I would suggest first of all to
upgrade the e1000 driver, just in case (I will shortly upload a new -aa
with all pending stuff included, but the latest one against 20pre5
is just in sync with mainline in terms of e1000).
