this_slice was used in reschedule_idle(), to determine
whether it was worth it to interrupt the currently running
task or if it is better to wait a while until the currently
running task voluntarily reschedules.
The performance report by the Fujitsu guy (that was posted
here today) suggests that we really want to use the per-task
average time slice again to prevent cache thrashing...
