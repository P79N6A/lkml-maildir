Interesting, I didn't know that was possible already. However,
have you actually tried it for NFS?
I tried it on 2.2.11-pre4 and afterwards the "mount" shows all
kinds of duplicate options: this makes me very suspicious about the
information. Also, cat /proc/mounts does _not_ show the newly added NFS
mount option. A first test seem to indicate that it doesn't work
for acreggmin but this is not conclusive.
Still I think that a /proc/sys/nfs may be useful for NFS options
outside the list of the de-facto standard options: you don't want
to update mount(2), mount(8) and the man pages for some exotic
NFS fine tuning option.
