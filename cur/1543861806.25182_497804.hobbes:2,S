But there is nothing new?
insert_sequence = remove_sequence = 0.
queue_work(W1) sets insert_sequence = 1.
flush_cpu_workqueue(cpu1):  wait until remove_sequence >= 1
Now suppose antother thread adds a work to cpu1 before W1.func()
calls flush_cpu_workqueue(cpu1). insert_sequence == 2.
When W1.func() does flush_workqueue(), run_workqueue() fires
that work, increments remove_sequence to 1 and wakes up Thread0.
In other words: currently flush_cpu_workqueue() waits until N
works form the queue will be flushed. If some work also does
flush_workqueue()->run_workqueue(), it just needs to execute one
"extra" work to confuse the first flush_cpu_workqueue().
