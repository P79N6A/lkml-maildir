Perhaps, I should elaborate more on this to eliminate possible 
misunderstanding. Of course, both main initiator driver and target 
add-on driver directly use the same hardware, so they share all internal 
hardware-related data, e.g. hardware_lock, but this doesn't matter for 
our topic, because this sharing is on the different level. All such data 
are hardware specific, hence different hardware have different sets of 
such data, hence it is impractical to find something common in them to 
expose as a common interface, which all initiator drivers should expose 
to its target add-ons: the interface would be more complicated than 
direct implementation in each particular case.
