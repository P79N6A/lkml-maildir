You don't need the permission of maintainers.  You need the permission
of copyright owners.  The two groups overlap, but are not the same.
Dead people cannot own anything, even copyright.  Their estate
probably can.  I don't think it is theoretically impossible to get
everyone's permission, though it may be quite close to practically
impossible.

Dual licensing is no easier.  It means it is licensed to be used under
either license.  You already have permission to use it under GPLv2.
So to get a dual license, you precisely need to get access under GPLv3
i.e. to convince copyright owners to make that license grant.  A thing
that we have already agreed is at least "hard".
