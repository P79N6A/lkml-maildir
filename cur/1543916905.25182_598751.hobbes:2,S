Well then, now I guess I know why the FB isn't working...
Sorry to open up the can of worms this turned out to be {after reading
all the other replies first}...

No.  That code is required - the StrongARM 1100 framebuffer driver
*needs* to know what the CPU frequency is so it can set the pixel clock
divisor.
The real problem is the silly people who added this to cpufreq.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_CPU_FREQ
unsigned int cpufreq_quick_get(unsigned int cpu); unsigned int
cpufreq_get(unsigned int cpu); #else static inline unsigned int
cpufreq_quick_get(unsigned int cpu) {
        return 0;
}
static inline unsigned int cpufreq_get(unsigned int cpu) {
        return 0;
}
#endif
which utterly bogus.
