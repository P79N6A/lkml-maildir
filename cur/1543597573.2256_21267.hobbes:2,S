Subject: bug in asm/rwlock.h?

I was looking at the symetry in rwlock.h and noticed this:
	#define __build_read_lock_ptr(rw, helper)   \
		asm volatile(LOCK "subl $1,(%0)\n\t" \
		....
	#define __build_read_lock_const(rw, helper)   \
		asm volatile(LOCK "subl $1,%0\n\t" \
		....
	#define __build_write_lock_ptr(rw, helper) \
		asm volatile(LOCK "subl $" RW_LOCK_BIAS_STR ",(%0)\n\t" \
		....
	#define __build_write_lock_const(rw, helper) \
		asm volatile(LOCK "subl $" RW_LOCK_BIAS_STR ",(%0)\n\t" \
		....
Why is %0 used indirectly in __build_write_lock_const?
Shouldn't it be
		asm volatile(LOCK "subl $" RW_LOCK_BIAS_STR ",%0\n\t" \
like in __build_read_lock_const?
It doesn't look like many people use __build_write_lock_const.
