I expect to reintroduce the MOD_{INC,DEC} rules in 2.5.  Al Viro's
patches to bump the module use count in the caller work up to a point
but they are not a complete fix.  You cannot bump the module use count
from an interrupt, which causes problem for netfilter (ask Rusty for
details).
A module can have multiple associated areas including the code segment,
the exception table and arch specific data like the IA64 unwind lists.
Al Viro's fix does not cover all of these areas, Alan Cox added a
spinlock for the exception table but nothing covers the arch specific
data.  Adding more spinlocks is not the answer, it penalizes the
mainline code to guard against an unusual event (module unload).
