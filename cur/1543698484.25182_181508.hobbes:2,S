The windows can freeze for many reasons. You could be running X in a 
lower priority, painting X terms is heavy on X using that command and it 
can steal cpu from the terminal who's process is working in retrieving 
data from the fs. No dma on the hdds, Etc.  I ran this command using 
test11 with akpm's test10-mm1 patch applied and 10 were going just fine. 
  All going at the same time along with mplayer playing a divx movie. No 
skips in video or audio and all the terminals were updating as rapidly 
as they could with no pauses of noticable length.
The schedular is nothing short of incredibly better than 2.4.x and 
prior.  Despite the xmms croud's loud cries of trying to get the kernel 
to fix their player's performance which seems to always suffer more than 
any other player i've tried.

having to manually adjust the schedular is seen by many as a fault in 
the design of the schedular.  The perfect schedular would be able to 
adjust itself automatically on it's own.  If that's perfect, then even 
if it's likely impossible to achieve it, it makes sense to strive to get 
as close to it as possible rather than create a set of separate 
schedulars which the root user (which really shouldn't be doing anything 
on the system all the time anyway) has to select whenever their workload 
changes from one goal to another.
