That's the problem. It calls poll even when there is not any user-mode
select/poll active.

Yes. You've got it. Private data is a place to put the per-process
poll mask.

Yes. May not actually need counters because each interrupt
will cache a status that can be read by anybody.
The struct file_pointer.private_data is the savior.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (799.53 BogoMips).
    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
