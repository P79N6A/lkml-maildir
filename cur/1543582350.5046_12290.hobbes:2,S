pure marketing!  Last I checked, it didn't have quotas either (well, it
is available as an extra patch, but they might make incompatable
changes later I gather).
If you go to
  
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/patches/linux/2.4.2-pre3/
and pick up patch-B-nfsdops and patch-C-reisernfs
you should get reasonable nfs service for reiserfs.
Note that this is not final code though.  The format of the filehandle
will probably change shortly as it doesn't currently contain a
generation number.
A similar patch is available somewhere under www.namesys.com I
believe.
