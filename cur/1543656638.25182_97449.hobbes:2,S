Yes, it would be a problem.  But I don't think that's the problem
here, and I don't think it can actually happen (it's a pretty insane
idea).
BTW, I can't reproduce your problem, maybe because I can't unload
parport_pc here:
Module parport cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in drivers/parport/init.c:234
Module parport_pc cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:1239
A little confused,
Rusty.
