Subject: NFS client doesn't see changes in files from NFS server

Hi, all.
I have a problem with two SuSE Linux 6.1 (Kernel 2.2.5) boxes connected via
NFS: In the server, a program modifies data in a file, and if I look at the
contents of the file (with cat, for example), I can see the new contents,
but if I look at the contens of the file from the client side, I can see
them unchanged (with cat, again), at least for a long time (more than 5
min., which is a long time for me).
The changes that my program do in the file rewrite only a few bytes, but
don' t modify the size of the file.
Is possible that NFS client doesn't see small changes (a few bytes) in
server files ?
Is there some parameters that correct this behavior ?
I´ve mounted it with different options: noac, acregmin=0, acregmax=0,
different
values for rsize and wsize, etc, but with the same results.
I need that the client realize the changes in the file immediately, not some
minutes after. Can anybody help me with this?
Thank you in advance,
Enrique Bernal
