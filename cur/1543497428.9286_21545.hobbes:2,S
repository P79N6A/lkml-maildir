   Is there any projects out there to add XTP to the standard linux
   kernel?
There is someone who is working on XTP/Linux and keeps sending me
patches, but they always need massive formatting cleanups before I can
apply them and then he disappears again for a few months.
This is not necessarily his fault, he may not have the time to finish
up and submit patches cleanly, but until _someone_ does this work I
cannot even put his work in progress code into the tree.
Later,
