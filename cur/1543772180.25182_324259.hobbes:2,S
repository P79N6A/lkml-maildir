Hi Andrew, Andrew, all,

This patch looks broken to me, please discard it. You do not want to call
i2c_detach_client when the corresponding i2c_attach_client failed. The
original code was fine in that respect. I don't think there is any
problem in the asb100_detect_subclients() function.
I do however think that there is a problem in the asb100_detect()
function, where a call to i2c_detach client() is missing:
ERROR3:
	i2c_detach_client(data->lm75[1]); <-- HERE
	i2c_detach_client(data->lm75[0]);
	kfree(data->lm75[1]);
	kfree(data->lm75[0]);
If we take that error path, it means that both subclients have been
successfully attached, thus need proper detach.
The reason why the bug triggered on Andrew (James Wade) is probably that
hwmon_device_register() failed, due to an order problem in a Makefile.
See 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/8/338,
 which has an explanation and a
patch fixing it (I think).
This still doesn't explain why the error path triggers the BUG(), and
although applying the aforementioned patch will probably get the driver
working, I'd really like to understand what's going on there.
Thanks,
