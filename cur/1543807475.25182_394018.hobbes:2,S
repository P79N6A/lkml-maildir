I complained about this x86_64 behaviour ages ago.  Andi claimed it was
the only way they could get there merging algorithm to work.  It
actually triggered a bug in SCSI because in-flight I/O that was rejected
gets unmapped and then remapped (which was, originally, not working).
They finally fixed it by making the unmap put back the original
scatterlist.  Perhaps this should go to linux-arch just in case anyone
else copied x86_64?
