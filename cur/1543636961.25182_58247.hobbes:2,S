If you feel like doing 'warnings patrol', then there are a bunch of
more important regular warnings[1] that need fixing up without having to look
through the pedantic output. Last I checked the pedantic stuff flagged
a lot of bits that the fix ended up uglier than the warning
(which 99.9% of people won't ever see anyway)
