Not really.  Userspace still has a problem when run on older kernels,
so it will have to check for AMD and kernel version anyway before
deciding to use the prefetch instruction.  That, or install SIGSEGV
and SIGBUS handlers to do the fixup in userspace.

If the workaround isn't compiled in, "prefetch" should be removed from
/proc/cpuinfo on the buggy chips.
