    Out of curiosity, why do you refer to the Tulip clones as
    `abominations'?  I'm running a few of them in high-performance
    network servers, and, with the netgear tulip.c they seem to be (on
    the basis of performance and looking at error logs) about as nice as
    I would want any ethernet card to be.
