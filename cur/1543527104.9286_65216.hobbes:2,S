	It is also kind of silly.  The only PID that should probably be
left alone is 1.  Perhaps below 10 as those seem to be kernel threads, but
300?  On my systems when I upgrade daemons I tend to restart them, and so
they end up with a higher PID.  When the machine is servicing other items
just fine there seems little reason to reboot the machine for a simple
upgrade to one of the daemons.  In this situation (which would seem
reasonably common to me), the hardcoding to 300 doesn't actually get you
anything except less PID space.
