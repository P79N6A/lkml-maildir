Hi,
the specs for MOP are freely available, the URL is
ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/DECnet/PhaseIV/maintop30.txt
MOP seems to consist of three parts, loopback testing, remote dumping/loading of
system and remote console. Somewhere (written for the linux-vax project)
there are userland tools which perform some of these operations.
I've been asked by someone (at a talk I was giving on Linux DECnet) about
the possibility of having a MOP remote console client which runs on Linux
to control a terminal server which requires this, so I'm looking into the
possibilites of this. Also I have started to put hooks in the raw socket
layer of the Linux DECnet code for MOP, but much work needs to be done
before it will be useful.
If anyone is interested in taking this further, plese let me know or send
mail to the linux-decnet list at dreamtime.org. The linux-decnet project
home page is at
