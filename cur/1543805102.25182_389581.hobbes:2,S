I tried to avoid doing that for it required arch support as I recall, but I'm
not sure which arch I was thinking of. It looks like it ought to be okay...
it's no worse than mmap.

Can you use TAB chars here please.

And here.

You don't actually need to calculate key until after you've done all those
checks, so I'd move it further down the file. You can use the function to
release key references in the error handling or have a separate error handling
return path.

Do we really want to restrict the key type implementor to using the r/w
semaphore. Would it be better to let the type decide whether it wants to use
the semaphore or let it use RCU if it so desires?
