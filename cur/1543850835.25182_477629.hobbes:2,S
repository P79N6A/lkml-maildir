Hi,
I'm experimenting with splice and have run into some unusual behaviour.
I am using the utilities in git://brick.kernel.dk/data/git/splice.git
In splice.h, when changing SPLICE_SIZE from:
#define SPLICE_SIZE (64*1024)
to
#define SPLICE_SIZE ((64*1024)+1)
splice-cp hangs indefinitely when copying files sized 65537 bytes or
more. It hangs on the first splice() call.
Is this a bug? I'd like to be able to copy much more than 64kb on a
single splice call.
Thanks!
Daniel
