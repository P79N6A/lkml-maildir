Ok, thanks. Updated patch below.
[PATCH] pegasus: Remove bogus checks in urb->complete() callbacks
urb->complete() callbacks registered in drivers/net/usb/pegasus.c needlessly
check for urb->context != NULL, but that is not possible (the only way that
can be possible would be a kernel bug elsewhere, and these checks would
simply end up hiding that). So let's remove the bogus checks.
