Good point!  Also, RAIF can store different file types differently.
Therefore, it is possible to mount RAIF over file systems with lots of
storage space and a flash file system (with usually less space).  In this
case, RAIF can be configured to use flash to keep replicas of the most
important data only.   And yes, thanks to the stackable nature of RAIF no
explicit flash support is required.  RAIF can reuse existing file systems
designed for flash media (e.g., JFFS2).
