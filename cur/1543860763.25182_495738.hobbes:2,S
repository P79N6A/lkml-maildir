(a) I'm well of aware of this, and (b) that changes nothing.
I said "PCI BARs" for a reason.  libata was written according to the 
following model:
	1) Programmatically reserve /all/ resources associated with
	   our PCI device
	2) Manually reserve resources associated with our PCI device,
	   but are not listed in struct pci_dev.
You have changed this to:
	1) Manually reserve /some/ resources associated with PCI device
	2) Manually reserve resources associated with our PCI device,
	   but are not listed in struct pci_dev.
But then 2.6.21 goes back to:
	1) Programmatically reserve /all/ resources associated with
	   our PCI device
	2) Manually reserve resources associated with our PCI device,
	   but are not listed in struct pci_dev.
Maybe I can say it more clearly by telling you how to fix the regression 
you have introduced:  Loop through all BAR resources in struct pci_dev, 
and reserve them if they are not already reserved by libata earlier in 
the code.  There.  Regression fixed.
(but then we rewrite this code again in 2.6.21)

Yes -- that's a bug, one that existed prior to the "it doesn't boot" 
combined mode regression everybody complained about.  I'm talking about 
a new regression just introduced via 
dc3c3377f03634d351fafdfe35b237b283586c04, not a old bug that existed 
prior to the regression introduced in 
368c73d4f689dae0807d0a2aa74c61fd2b9b075f.
