According to Documentation/ioctl-number.txt,
XFS_IOC_XXXs (_IOWR('X', aa, bb)) are defined for XFS like below.
From Documentation/ioctl-number.txt:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code    Seq#    Include File            Comments
========================================================
:                 :
'X'     all     linux/xfs_fs.h
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So XFS_IOC_FREEZE and XFS_IOC_THAW cannot be lifted to generic code simply.
I think we should create new generic numbers for freeze and thaw
like FIBMAP as followings.
linux/fs.h:
#define FIFREEZE _IO(0x00,3)
#define FITHAW   _IO(0x00,4)
And xfs_freeze calls XFS_IOC_FREEZE with a magic number 1, but what is 1?
Instead, I'd like the sec to timeout on freeze API in order to thaw
the filesystem automatically.  It can prevent a filesystem from staying
frozen forever.
(Because a freezer may cause a deadlock by accessing the frozen filesystem.)
Any comments are very welcome.
Cheers, Takashi
