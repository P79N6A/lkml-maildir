You have my agreement on the craziness of this idea.  It's a lot easier for
the kernel to do smart things with write behind with write() rather than
mmap()-ed pages being touched.  SunOS is the only system I know which does
both "correctly" (correctly meaning the same way whether it is mmap or
write).
It's also a lose to do mmap() instead of read/write for small files.  Linux
is light weight enough that the cross over point is pretty small, probably
under 8K and certainly under 16K, but still.
