Having a sys_copy() syscall would be incredibly useful for Lustre
(distributed Linux fs).  We could start a copy from one storage node
to another (or more likely many to many for a file striped over many
storage nodes) at num_stripes * uni-directional bandwidth with no
impact to the client node.  Instead, we have to copy files at best a
single client's bi-directional network_bandwidth.
Cheers, Andreas
