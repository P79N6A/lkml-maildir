Two things to check first:  The memory (we've seen 2.4 find bad ram bugs
2.2 did not) and also that its getting the memory size right. 2.4 uses
E820 then E801 memory sizing, older 2.2 (< 2.2.18 or so) didnt do this.
So far I only know of one box that gets memory size wrong just with
E820.
Finally what is plugged into it ?
