Yeah, I have a patch that I've been kicking around.  It's working out
pretty well, though there are some kinks to work around.  Nothing fatal
so far.  I realized when I finally sat down to it that we can just or
together the ptr/len bits and cache them in the structure to help lower
layers with the alignment checks they're currently doing.

Cool.
I'll try and send something out the next few days.
