Still no go, stalled after the
ACPI: (supports S0 S1 S3 S4 S5)
line this time (probably statistical fluke though).
dmesg.log.gz attached.
# uname -a
Linux andi 2.6.19-rc4-mm1-hrt-dyntick4 #1 Fri Nov 10 03:19:06 CET 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
Note that the first boot became unstable somehow (net connections stalled,
eventually it hung completely while trying to switch to another tty;
Magic SysRq reboot worked). I'm working within second boot right now.
Anything I should investigate? I'll see what I can do for now...
Thanks!
