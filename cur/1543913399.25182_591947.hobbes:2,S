Okay, here's a possible fix: add ->lock() and ->unlock() callbacks, to 
be called when mmap_sem is taken either for read or write.  Also add a 
->release() for when the mm goes away to avoid the need to care about 
the entire data structure going away.
The notifier list would need to be kept sorted to avoid deadlocks.
