Subject: Implementing an "on demand" routing protocol?

I'm implementing the AODV routing protocol (RFC 3561) on Linux. One of
the protocol's salient features is being "on demand": rather than
receiving (and transmitting) regular updates on the topology of the
network, it waits until it needs a route to a given host (or network).
With AODV routing, in the following simple network
Host A <----> Host B <----> Host C,
it may be that A is unaware of its route to C. If A has a packet
destined for C, it buffers that packet and broadcasts a request for a
route to C.
Is there an interface whereby the kernel can be told "when you have a
packet, but lack a route to its destination, pass a message to this
daemon requesting a route and buffer that packet until the daemon is
done searching for route"? Any info would be appreciated.
