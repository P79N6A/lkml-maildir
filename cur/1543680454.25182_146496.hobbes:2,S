The bug is in xmalloc, meaning that it assumes that returning NULL is
always an error.  Presumably xmalloc should look *either* like:
void *xmalloc(size_t s)
{
	void *p = malloc(s);
	
	if ( !p && s )
		barf();
	else
		return p;
}
... or ...
void *xmalloc(size_t s)
{
	void *p;
	/* Always return a valid allocation */
	if ( s == 0 ) s = 1;
	p = malloc(s);
	
	if ( !p )
		barf();
	else
		return p;
}
