I'm sorry, but you're being an idiot if you think
that 16K interrupts per second and forwarding 75K
pps generate no cpu load. Its just that simple.
It also means that you've never profiled a kernel
because you don't understand where the loads are
generated. You've probably been on too many lists
with too many people who have no idea what
they're talking about.
The NAPI paper is complete rubbish because its
based on a principle which no longer exists: that
is the assumption that you'll get an interrupt
for every packet. Not only is that hardly ever
the case, modern controllers (such as Intel's
GigE controllers) can precisely mitigate the
interrupts in hardware. You *could* tune this on
the fly, but there is really no reason to,
because at low interrupt loads cpu overhead is
not a concern and lower latencies are preferred.
You'll never get an interrupt for consecutive
packets, and since packets usually arrive in
bursts, the mitigation model works even better
than if they arrived randomly.
With simple tuning the controller is more
efficient with hardware interrupts. None of the
arguments in the NAPI paper hold true when using
a modern GigE controller. 
Of course you folks could never really know that,
because the tools to measure things don't work,
and you all seem to be using systems that are so
kludged up that you don't even know what you're
measuring.
