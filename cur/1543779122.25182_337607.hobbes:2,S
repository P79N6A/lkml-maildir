Yes - I could (I did actually).
Something like that should be part of the record here.  Not everyone
has your earlier linux-mm email thread right at hand.

That was quick - thanks.
Once we have a clear description of this syntax in the record,
I anticipate raising as an issue that this syntax does not have a
single integer or string token value per file (or at most, an array
or list of comparable integer values).
But first things first.  Until any lurkers can easily see what is being
proposed, it is inconvenient to carry on discussions of alternatives
and their relative merits.
