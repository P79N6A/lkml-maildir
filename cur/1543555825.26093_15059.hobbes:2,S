Problem solved
I had to bypass the following instructions in arch/i386/boot/setup.S
#
#       You must preserve the other bits here. Otherwise embarrasing
#       things
#       like laptops powering off on boot happen. Corrected version by
#       Kira
#       Brown from Linux 2.2
#
        inb     $0x92, %al                      #
        orb     $02, %al                        # "fast	A20" version
        outb    %al, $0x92			# some chips have only this
Then my system worked without problems.
Now what I ask is:
1) Why did they disable my videocard ?
2) Whate are they supposed to do?
3) Would you answer me this time ?
Many thanks to Rasmus, Albert & Jo Geraerts, the only three who answered
me. I would have expected more response from the list, but it seems the
old gold days are over
	Bye
