For the -DMODULE case, 'module_init' becomes a public init_module()
which in turn calls the internal (ie. static) driver init function.
For the non-module case, module_init(func) evaluates to
__initcall(func), which is defined as below.  As the initcall_t var is
simply flagged with the __init_call attribute, the internal driver init
func can be static for the non-modules case.
#define __initcall(fn) \
        static initcall_t __initcall_##fn __init_call = fn
Unless I am missing something here, gcc seems to be emitting a bad
warning?
