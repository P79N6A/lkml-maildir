Alan,
Could you please tell me where I can find an example of this?? I searched
the whole drivers/net directory, and couldn't find any occurrence.
Is this really supposed to be done in the HW driver / support code level,
or is it supposed to be done in the protocol (IP / ARP) level??
Thanks for the reply!!
Later,
Ivan
