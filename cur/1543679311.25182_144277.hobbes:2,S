   People with PCMCIA cards have been reporting the same thing.  It sounds
   like something's up with the netdev layer, and it has persisted until
   2.5.73 thus far.
If there are bugs in pcmcia drivers, they are _really_ going to show
now.  The change is that 'rmmod' is allowed even if the device is
"up".  We don't grab/drop module reference counts when the device is
brought up/down.  We simply "down" up net devices at
unregister_netdevice() time.
So if a device is racey, it's going to be "really" racey now.
If people mention which devices give the problems (with current
kernels, we've fixed a lot of bugs as of late) the drivers can
be audited for register/unregister bugs.
