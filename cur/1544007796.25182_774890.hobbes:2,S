If it were to be set to me it would have to be S: Odd Fixes.  I don't know if this
is on Matthew's redhat-official "pile of laptops"...
Either way I've marked the webpage hosting the original code as depricated 
and added a link to linux-acpi's home.  I'll have to test the new patch too 
at some point but not this weekend.
