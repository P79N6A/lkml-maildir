No buffers are allocated if the volume doesn't support compression at all. 
But if it does support them then we allocate them, even if then there are 
no compressed files as there is no quick way to tell the difference.
Buffer allocation at use time is NOT an option because the buffers are 
allocated using vmalloc() which is extremely expensive and we would need to 
allocate at every single initial ->readpage() call of a compressed file.

The former is not possible for ntfs as there is no quick way to tell if use 
will use decompression or not. And the latter creates a lot of complexity. 
I gave an example using a callback of how it could be done in a previous 
post but I don't like introducing complexity for a minority group of users.

Exactly. However all is well, if you have read the whole thread you will 
have seen the cpu_possible() optimization which allows allocating for 
actual existing CPU slots which means there is no wasted RAM or at least 
very little... On a 32 CPU machine I agree that it is irrelevant if you are 
wasting a few MiB of ram, you probably have multiple GiB of the stuff anyway...
