Currently, it is like this:
ifconfig up: -> device is open. device remains open, no matter whether the
isdn connection is up or down.
isdn connection is up: -> Nothing special, tbusy (or the equivalent
	softnet stuff) is set in the usual manner. (tbusy set
	in isdn_net_hard_start_xmit() if internal queues are full,
	tbusy cleared when hardware irq signals that queue is empty
	enough again.)  
If isdn connenction is down and no pending traffic for the device:
	Tbusy is not set. Now, if network layer sends down a packet
	to the isdn netdevice, the interface triggers demand dialing.
	isdn_net_start_xmit() returns 1 and sets tbusy. Thus, network
	layer ceases sending down further packets. If network layer
	queues further packetes for the isdn netdevice, those packets
	will stay in the packet scheduler/device queues.
When in demand dialing stage (with tbusy set):
	if isdn connection is established, tbusy is cleared. The
	network layer will now restart sending the packets in the device
	queues immediately. If establishing the connection fails,
	all internal queues are purged, the qdisc is reset, and tbusy
	will also be cleared again such that the devide is in the idle state
	again.

Usually, it is not long. Might be less than a second for rawip encapsulation,
but with ppp it might take longer due to pppd negociation delays. With
interfaces configured for and waiting for a callback from the peer, delay will also increase.

Something like: If conenction is not up after a few seconds, clear all queues
and reset qdisc, but remain in dialing stage?
    kuznet> Another moment: do you really understand that now packets

Yes.

That's what I was wondering about, but did not try to figure out yet.
