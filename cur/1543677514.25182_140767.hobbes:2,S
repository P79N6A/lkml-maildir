Subject: [PATCH] use tty_driver.name as default .devfs_name

  Hi,
In 2.5.71 with devfs enabled my USB modem appears as /dev/<NULL>0
instead of the usual /dev/usb/acm/0.  I tracked down this problem to be
due to 
ChangeSet@1.1215.98.11  2003-06-06 08:54:35-07:00  akpm@digeo.com
(originally "[PATCH] Fix tty devfs mess" from Christoph Hellwig
<hch@lst.de>)
where a new .devfs_name field was introduced in struct tty_driver.
However, many drivers (including cdc-acm) haven't been updated to define
it.  OTOH they seem to be quite happy using their .name for devfs as
well.  This patch makes .name the default .devfs_name.  Since
tty_{,un}register_device() appear to be the only users of .devfs_name,
there should be no side effects.  WFM.  Please consider applying.
  Roman.
