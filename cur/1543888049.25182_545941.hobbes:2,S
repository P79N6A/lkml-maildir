Subject: [PATCH] Further update of the i386 boot documentation

A number of items in the i386 boot documentation have been either
vague, outdated or hard to read.  This text revision adds several more
examples, including a memory map for a modern kernel load.  It also
adds a field-by-field detailed description of the setup header, and a
bootloader ID for Qemu.

+
+For each field, some are information from the kernel to the bootloader
+("read"), some are expected to be filled out by the bootloader
+("write"), and some are expected to be read and modified by the
+bootloader ("modify").
+
+All general purpose boot loaders should write the fields marked
+(obligatory).  Boot loaders who want to load the kernel at a
+nonstandard address should fill in the fields marked (reloc); other
+boot loaders can ignore those fields.

+Field name:	setup_secs
+Type:		read
+Offset/size:	0x1f1/1
+Protocol:	ALL
+
+  The size of the setup code in 512-byte sectors.  If this field is
+  0, the real value is 4.  The real-mode code consists of the boot
+  sector (always one 512-byte sector) plus the setup code.
+
+Field name:	 root_flags
+Type:		 modify (optional)
+Offset/size:	 0x1f2/2
+Protocol:	 ALL
+
+  If this field is nonzero, the root defaults to readonly.  The use of
+  this field is deprecated; use the "ro" or "rw" options on the
+  command line instead.
+
+Field name:	syssize
+Type:		read
+Offset/size:	0x1f4/4 (protocol 2.04+) 0x1f4/2 (protocol ALL)
+Protocol:	2.04+
+
+  The size of the protected-mode code in units of 16-byte paragraphs.
+  For protocol versions older than 2.04 this field is only two bytes
+  wide, and therefore cannot be trusted for the size of a kernel if
+  the LOAD_HIGH flag is set.
