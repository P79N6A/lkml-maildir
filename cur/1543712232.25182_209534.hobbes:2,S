elf.h include is present in arch/ppc/boot/simple/misc.c and
arch/ppc/boot/simple/misc-embedded.c. The first one caused my warning
and the include can be safely removed from there. The other file is not
used in my config (prep) but I did try to compile it with elf.h include
removed (make arch/ppc/boot/simple/misc-embedded.o) and it failed. So
here is the patch against arch/ppc/boot/simple/misc.c. Nevertheless,
asm-ppc/elf.h can not be included by itself without a warning about
struct task_struct - is this a problem or not?
