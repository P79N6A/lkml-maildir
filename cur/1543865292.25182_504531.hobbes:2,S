Right. We should for example encourage people to use some kind of 
paralellizing construct. 
I know! We could even call them "threads", so to give people the idea that 
they are independent smaller entities in a thicker "rope", and we could 
call that bigger entity a "task" or "process", since it "processes" data.
Or is that just too far out?
