I've also experienced the "slow tar" problem with 2.2.1. I had this
problem with early 2.1.x releases, then went away ca. 2.1.86.
I've narrowed the problem specifically to tar, by gunzip-ing the
file as a separate step. The "top" command doesn't show significant
cpu or memory consumption. Could it be a problem with ext2fs?
