I stuck this in -mm (after fixing many tens of wordwrapping corruptions).
It does need many coding style fixes sometime.  80-cols, newlines after
`if' statements, macros->commented-inlines, fix a=b=c=d=e=<expr> statements,
etc.  Well-understood stuff.  So we'll need a version 2 sometime, please.  
Meanwhile, what we have here is OK for people to review-n-test.
