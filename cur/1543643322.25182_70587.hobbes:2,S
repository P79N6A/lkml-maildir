Hi all :
I'm using a linux box running RH7.3 (kernel 2.4.18-3).
I've inserted one kernel module and I need information
on how much code space and data space my module
has consumed.
Is there any way to know these statistics ? Doing a
cat  /proc/<process ID>/status (or stat or statm)
showed some information. But I'm not very clear.
Any pointers in this regard are highly appreciated.
Thanks,
Parthi.
