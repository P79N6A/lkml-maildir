    Yes, possible.

    A way how to verify the table completely would be to attach a mouse
    to the keyboard port, set in it echo mode (send 0xee), then send bytes,
    and see what comes, the mouse echoes back everything except 0xec - 
    echo cancel.
    I think you'll find different results for different i8042's with this,
    and that's one of the reasons I speak about the warped glass ...
    Because then you have to care not only about keyboard quirks, but also
    about i8042's quirks, and the result if you combine them ...
Do you have any evidence for this?
I have never seen any evidence that the i8042 translation was not constant.

    For some reason, most of the AT keyboards I have here generate 0x83 for
    F7. Don't know why - the documented value is 0x02. But it's translated
    correctly by the i8042.

    Oops? They are not.
Yes, sorry, I meant `That is why the values of Set 1 for the keys "2" and "3"
are anomalous'. To be more precise, in all cases the release codes for
Set 1 and Set2 (both with translation) are equal, except for these two keys,
where Set 1 has release codes 0x41, 0x54 and Set 2 has release codes 0x83, 0x84.
You see that this means that you can remove almost all question marks
in your table. We know for example that 81 and 82 are translated as 81 and 82.
In other words, with very few exceptions the translation is the identity
on bytes with high bit set.
