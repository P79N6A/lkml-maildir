Indeed. 
Some other UNIXes are broken in this regard, and there are cache coherency 
issues on some platforms that people who depend on this behaviour may need 
to be aware of, but in general Linux has always gone for coherenct mmap's.
POSIX doesn't require it, but quite frankly, non-coherent shared mmap just 
isn't worth it. You might as well not support it at all at that point.
[ I think at least HP-UX used to be broken in this regard, but HP-UX had
  such atrocious mmap behaviour _anyway_ that I don't understand how
  anybody could use it (you couldn't munmap partial mappings etc). I think
  they finally fixed it a few years ago and updated their source base from
  some totally ancient BSD to something a bit more modern. ]
