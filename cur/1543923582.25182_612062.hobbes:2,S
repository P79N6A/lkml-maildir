  Actually, wouldn't a generic netlink interface be more elegant? Then
we could connect it with DBUS and it would be much easier for
applications (Desktop) to handle such events.
  I agree that near-to-oom conditions are quite volatile and maybe we
want a technically simple (and thus more reliable) mechanism for the
notification but I anyway wanted to point to this possibility.
