This obviously needs to be
+static struct disk_attribute disk_attr_driver = {
otherwise the following part won't work:

Additionally, the naming "rawio_cmd_filter" and RCF_* seems a bit
confusing (after all raw IO usually refers to O_DIRECT file access).
"sg_cmd_filter" and SGF_* appear to be a better choice IMHO.
How should changes to the table be made? I suppose something like "echo
add 04 > ok_read_commands". But rcf_store doesn't seem to get called. Am I
missing something?
Regards, and thanks for this patch
