Tried all this on my Laptop but nothing seems to work for me. 
I do "echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep" and the systems seems to go into S3.
When I press some key to wake it up again it powers up but I get nothing
than a black screen. It's not only the video card that's not working,
because the only thing it reacts to is Sysrq (without screen of course).
One additional thing I found is that in this state the HDD led keeps
lighting all the time untill I reboot my system. After rebooting I
couldn't find anything interesting in my logs.
Is there any way I could get S3 working on my laptop?
some data:
Acer Travel Mate 661lci
Gentoo Base System version 1.6.10
kernel 2.6.11
I did all this testing with a minimal kernel that only had the
absolutely necessary drivers.
Thanks for help,
Maxi
