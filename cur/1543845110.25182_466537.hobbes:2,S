Most probably this is due to compiler optimizations, eg. the register is 
reused for another purpose. Recently I was pleased to discover that gdb 
6.5 is smart enough to tell the user that a variable has been optimized 
out (certainly with help from debug info produced by gcc).

Oh I only meant that *maybe* gdb deserved some optimizations that would be 
suitable for general use, but this is pure speculation. I agree that a 
custom modified gdb is in a way akin to crash.

This is exactly what I had in mind, for the very reasons you mentioned.
