For the TLB issue, higher order pagecache doesn't help. If distros
ship with a 4K page size on powerpc, and use some larger pages in
the pagecache, some people are still going to get angry because
they wanted to use 64K pages... But I agree 64K pages is too big
for most things anyway, and 16 would be better as a default (which
hopefully x86-64 will get one day).
Anyway, for io performance, there are alternatives, dispite what
some people seem to be saying. We can submit larger sglists to the
device for larger ios, which Jens is looking at (which could help
all types of workloads, not just those with sequential large file
IO).
After that, I'd find it amusing if HBAs worth thousands of $ have
trouble looking up sglists at the relatively glacial pace that IO
requires, and/or can't spare a few more K for reasonable sglist
sizes, but if that is really the case, then we could use iommus
and/or just attempt to put physically contiguous pages in pagecache,
rather than require it.
