As a gamer it really makes wonders. That's really all I can say because
swap prefetching is such a simple logical thing that one does not need
to go into details as its been said so many times over and over again
before. Having something like this is beneficial to desktop users.
I suppose support for 1000 some odd CPU's in the kernel is really useful
as well for most people....
One can go on and on with the examples, as I seen over the years it
seems to just depend on what the few major maintainers want and not
what the public finds actually useful.
