More info. I use a 56k dialup link and PPD to essentially become
my own ISP for my network at home. The machines at home are nodes
on the company's LAN. I have two dedicated machines, one at
work and one at home who's only purpose is to forward IP packets.
These machines are, otherwise, idle.
When I am using ftp to download some work to one of my other
home computers, it is functional impossible to do any useful
work on any other connection. The connections persist, but
no data will get through when a FTP transfer is in progress
except for the FTP data. Somehow the FTP data stream is able
to hog the entire transmission bandwidth. Attempts to "fix" it
be tuning Nagle off, Van Jacobson, etc., all off doesn't do
anything useful.
I have from time-to-time reported as far back as Linux 2.0, the
fact that there are TCP stalls when using PPP. These stalls
still persist with 2.4.20 and I've just had to accept the so-
called "fact" that 1 to 10 second stalls when using PPP are
"normal".
At one time I thought it was just that the modems had lost
sync so I set up a wire-to-wire PPP link here at work. The
stalls still exist when using the RS-232C link with a null-
modem cable. Evidence is that packets are lost, even with
a direct connection. It takes <too much> time for Linux to
discover the missing datagram and have it re-sent. When a
stream of data (FTP) is being sent, nothing seems to get
lost except the ACKs from the receiving end. It seems as
though RS-232C is not full duplex. If something is being
sent, nothing will be received and vice versa.
But... If you write to RS-232C with a test program, with
pins 2,3 shorted (loop-back), you can always read what
you wrote with no errors IFF hardware CRTCTS is turned OFF.
If I enable hardware handshaking, necessary for a modem,
with RTS jumpered to CTS, all bets are off. There are
many missing bytes, even at 9600 baud. However, when
connected through modems, this affect goes away. So,
it seems as though the PPP problem is related to RS-232C
problems, but I'll be damned if I can find it.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
