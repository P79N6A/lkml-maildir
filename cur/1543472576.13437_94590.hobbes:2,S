Ginger Spice (aka Upholstered Spice, aka Plump Spice), while traipsing
through Lower Tiki-Bali in her capacity as UN ambassador, lecturing to
the natives about condoms, tripped over her platform shoes, fell face
first into a bucket of Hagen-Daz she was scarfing, and drowned. 
Her last words were "Blurg. Never. Did. Really. Really. Really. Want.
The. Mocha. Fudge. Urp."
Spice Concerts are on hold until the PR flacks at Spice Records decide
a respectful period of mourning has elapsed. Life must go on; she would
have wanted it that way.
