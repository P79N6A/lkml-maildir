Ted, if I understand you correctly, I agree with you.  ;-)
What users need is for a window to pop up saying "the usb drive is
turned off" or "we are getting checksum errors from XXX, this may
indicate hardware problems that require your attention".
Now that GUIs exist, and now that more errors are possible because the
kernel is more complex, perhaps kernel error handling should be
reconsidered.  I don't have the feeling that anyone has felt themselves
authorized to take a deep look at how this ought to be designed.  I mean
sure, there are sometimes console windows that things get printed into,
but unsophisticated users basically want to be prompted if something is
wrong that needs their attention and to not have their experience
cluttered by a console window otherwise.  Also, it has long been
irritating having to make error codes conform to one of the existing
error codes when there is often no good connection between the name of
an existing error code and the new error condition one has just coded,
and there is no space left for new error codes.
Ted, what do you think?

Perhaps these policy choices should be mount options, what do you think?
