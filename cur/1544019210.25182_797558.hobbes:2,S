Hi Len,
The following patch fixes a long-standing bug in the hibernate code related to
swap, which causes the swap partition used for saving hibernation images to
become unusable after two consecutive failing attempts to hibernate.
Please add to the suspend branch as 2.6.29 material.
Thanks,
Rafael
