Thanks, Bjorn and Alan!
After thinking again here is a 3rd version to change quirk_via_irq().
Motivation is to cleanup the IOAPIC-case:
Currently as of 2.6.13-rc6 new_irq is wrong then,
as dev->irq isn't the PIN number.
Solutions: either calculate correct new_irq (= PIN-Number & 0x0F)
 or don't apply likely wrong value.
Following diff takes the 2nd way.
Well, VT8237 ignores the wrong new_irq in IOAPIC-Mode,
but its irritating to see dmesg print out nonsense then.
