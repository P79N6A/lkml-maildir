Well, this cable is only about 50cm long, or even shorter, and using a 
shorter one would be difficult there, even if I manage to get hold of one. 
But, in principle, if this is not a generic ahci problem that needs to be 
solved, I personally can somehow live with it. Having to wait 1 minute is 
not very nice, but so far not critical.
Thanks for your help
