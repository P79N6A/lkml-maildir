Subject: [PATCH] Hotplug PCI driver for 2.4.13-pre5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Another release of the PCI Hotplug core and the Compaq PCI Hotplug
driver for 2.4.13-pre5 is at:
 	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/pci-hotplug-2001_10_19-2.4.13-pre5.patch.gz
With a full changelog at:
 	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/pci-hotplug-Changelog
modutils >= 2.4.10 is required to use this version of the driver.
Changes since the last release:
 	- forward ported to 2.4.13-pre5
	- no longer needs ddfs.  The PCI Hotplug core is now the pcihpfs
	  filesystem.
	- some source code renames to the Compaq driver.
	- added spinlock to protect the list of hotplug slots.
TODO:
 	- Port the Linux PPC hotplug pci controller driver to the
	  hotplug pci core interface, whenever Anton sends me an
	  updated file...
thanks,
greg k-h
