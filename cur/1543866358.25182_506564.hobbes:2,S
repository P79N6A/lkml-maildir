You are interested in presents of `mkimage', but yet we discussing its
missing, or "Error -> Don't care" behavior.
uImage, as i can compare with other *final* targets, like bzImage on PC,
must be made in case of `make uImage', or if default rule depends on
it. Thus, if it fails it, must be error. It doesn't matter what cause
it, and what message was printed:

In this example `uImage' is required by final target, e.g.
,-*-
|all: prepare uImage modules_install

`-*-

So, are we ignoring our primary (default) goal?
OK, as you wish. As for me it's a plain bloat, but i have neither one
for-embedded setup to propose non-bloating change for _you_ (:.
