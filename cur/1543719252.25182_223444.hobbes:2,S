Single megapatch (1.5 Mb in size) is not the best way to merge something into Linux kernel.
Now quick look at the patch itself:
1)
diff -ruN linux-2.6.6.org/arch/m32r/drivers/8390.c linux-2.6.6/arch/m32r/drivers/8390.c

+#include "../../../drivers/net/8390.h"
Is this really needed ?
2) File arch/m32r/drivers/mappi_ne.c contains almost complete copy of drivers/net/ne.c
with lots of code probably useless for your systems (old style ISA probing, ISAPnP 
support etc.)
Also code like this is definetely unacceptable:
+#ifdef CONFIG_PLAT_MAPPI
+		outb_p(0x4b, ioaddr + EN0_DCFG);
+#elif CONFIG_PLAT_OAKS32R
+		outb_p(0x48, ioaddr + EN0_DCFG);
+#else
+		outb_p(0x49, ioaddr + EN0_DCFG);
+#endif
This fragment can be rewritten this way, with all  #ifdef mess hidden in the some header file:
+		outb_p(MY_MAGIC_OFFSET, ioaddr + EN0_DCFG);
3) arch/m32r/drivers/smc91111.copying contains GPL copy. Do you really need it ?
arch/m32r/drivers/smc91111.readme.txt can happily live in Documentation/networking.
4) Do you really need to reimplement Linux console subsystem in arch/m32r/drivers/video/console.c,
arch/m32r/drivers/video/fbmem.c, arch/m32r/drivers/video/fbcon.h ?
5) Any specific reason to implement read[bwl]/write[bwl] this way:
+unsigned char _readb(unsigned long addr)
+{
+       return *(volatile unsigned char *)addr;
+}
Why not to inline them ?
6) Lots of ugly debugging #ifdef's in arch/m32r/kernel/ptrace.c
7) arch/m32r/lib/clib.c contains slightly strange abs() function which
isn't used anywhere in the patch.
Best reards.
