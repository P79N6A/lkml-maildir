TCQ = Tank Commander's Quarters
I've no idea what it stands for in Linux-Kernel. It must mean
something important though, as it comes up so regularly.

SATA  = Serial ATA
PATA  = Parallel ATA
ATAPI = ATA Programming Interface
Question: What's ATA ??? I've no idea.
 > SCSI erm ... obvious
SCSI = Small Computer Systems Interface
IDE  = Integrated Drive Electronics
MFM  = Modified Frequency Modulation (ST-506)
RLL  = Run Length Limited (ST-506)
All forms of hard disk interface - that I do know.
ST-506 = Seagate Technology model 506 hard drive
         (which set the MFM and RLL standards)
Best wishes from Riley.
