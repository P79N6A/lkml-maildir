Indeed. Mesa will provide direct render acceleration on these cards without 
using the proprietary driver. Since the 9000 is really too old to run modern 
games, I suspect it will be more than adequate.
I'd investigate the open source solution, because ATI's proprietary driver is 
poor quality, even for your average binary vendor.
