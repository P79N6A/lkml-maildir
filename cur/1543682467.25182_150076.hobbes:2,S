That looks horrible.
In 2.6-test1 the following code is used:
RPM             := $(shell if [ -x "/usr/bin/rpmbuild" ]; then echo rpmbuild; \
                        else echo rpm; fi)
I would suggest to do it this way, avoiding a distro specific check.
Also there is no reason to export the RPM variable
