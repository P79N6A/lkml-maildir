Right. So maybe we could move the initialization parts of new_slab()
to __new_slab() so that the callers that are actually interested in
'reserve' could do allocate_slab(), store page->reserve and do rest of
the initialization with it?
As for the __GFP_WAIT handling, I *think* we can move the interrupt
enable/disable to allocate_slab()... Christoph?
