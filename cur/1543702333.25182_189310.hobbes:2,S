The basic thought likely to go through the head of someone first
thinking about this bit of logic is that arg has to be between 0 and
_NSIG to be valid.  It then requires a second thought to realize that
since arg is 0, you don't have to check explicitly for arg < 0.
Everytime we can avoid requiring 'a second thought', we (feable minded
humans) win.

No - such a comment doesn't remove the 'second thought' in this case.
Rather, it emphasizes it.
It is the sort of comment that (1) I find myself writing often, and then
(2) later replacing with code that renders the comment irrelevant.
It's one of those little "reader beware" (caveat lector) comments that
often mark places where a little code refinement can remove a comment.
Whenever a comment that explains why something is or is not done or is
special cased can be replaced with code that just does (or doesn't do)
it or doesn't need a special case, with no loss of form, fit, function
or performance, that's likely a win-win.
