Subject: [PATCH] ring_buffer: remove unused ring_buffer size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/17/116

struct ring_buffer.size is not set after ring_buffer is initialized
or resized. it is always 0.
we can use "buffer->pages * BUF_PAGE_SIZE" to get ring_buffer's size
