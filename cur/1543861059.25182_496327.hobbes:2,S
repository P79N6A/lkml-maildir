NO!
Specific cases of type mismatches may work on many machines
(say different pointer types as long as they aren't accessed),
but in general this won't work since types affect calling conventions.
Abusing aliasing like this is exactly like casting a function
pointer to a different type that it actually has, and then invoking
it at that type: all bets are off.
Don't do this. Ever.
