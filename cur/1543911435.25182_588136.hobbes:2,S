* So use integer math: (task->utime + task->stime) * 100 / jiffies
  and you get the 'common' percentage. In integer, that is.
* I am not sure about the use of jiffies when it comes to CONFIG_NO_HZ=y.

IIRC they are allowed since ... recently (2.6.16, .17? can't remember). When
the kernel tries to execute an FP instruction (and traps as a result), more
kernel code will enable that the FP stack gets properly switched when a process
changes between userspace-kernelspace.

That will give link failure for __udivdi3. Use do_div().
