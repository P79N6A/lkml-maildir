I've got 2 OSB4 machines here, one a Tyan HEsl 2567 board. MTRRs 
have been disabled on this board for a couple years now with 
every kernel release, which I'm told is due to the MTRR problem 
described in this thread.
00:00.1 PCI bridge: ServerWorks CNB20LE (rev 01)
Kimball, we chatted before about AGP on this board and a few
other issues, but I don't know if we discussed the MTRR issue.  
Could you confirm this problem?  If the problem is anything
workaroundable, it would be nice to have MTRRs working on this
box sometime as video is quite slow.  I'm willing to test any 
potential workarounds if something creeps up.
TIA
