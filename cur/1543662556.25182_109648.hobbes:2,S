Nope, if I just kexec the same 2.5.59 kernel+kexec patches that I'm booted
on it says: 
Synchronizing SCSI caches: 
Shutting down devices
Starting new kernel
Could you give me a high-level sketch of what you're doing? kexec -l loads
the new kernel, then what do you do? Drop back into real mode and jump to
the normal kernel entry point? Or decompress by hand, do some alternate
setup of the early page tables and try to jump in at the 32-bit entry point?
Is all I can assume from the above that I crash in the new kernel before
console_init()? Or should I expect something from the decompress code?
Thanks,
M.
