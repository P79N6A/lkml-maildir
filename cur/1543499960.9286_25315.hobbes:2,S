Hey Alan!

	Care to elaborate on this a bit?
	I've been tinkering with using a SmartMedia card with a pcmcia
adapter to do a smartcard/dongle kind of thing for some crypto work.  For
a laptop, this helps keep things like keys off the box and transportable
between boxes without leaving it sitting (yes, yes, I know about caching
issues and trojans and the whole nine yards).
	Sounds like a similar idea to the parallel port idea.
	What about 2.2?  I noticed that the capabilities stuff is largely
supplanting the securelevel idea.
