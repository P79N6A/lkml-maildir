I'm pretty sure you'll find SMP machine with broken ACPI cpufreq
(therefore cpu_init_acpi() will fail). And if user is perverse enough,
he might boot with one cpu then simulate hotplug of second one.
OTOH:
1) user is already doing perverse things at this point
and
2) machine BIOS is b0rken
...so... it is only theoretical and probably not worth fixing.
