This is not the real fix.
Allowing people to use up vmalloc() space by opening the /proc files would 
be a major DoS attack. Not worth it.
Instead, just make /proc/interrupts use the proper _sequence_ things, so
that instead of trying to print out everything in one go, you have the
"s_next()" thing to print them out one at a time. The seqfile interfaces
will then do the rigth thing with blocking/caching, and you only need a
single page.
Al - do we have some good documentation of how to use the seq-file 
interface? 
In the meantime, without documentation, the best place to look is just at 
other examples. One such example would be the kernel/kallsyms.c case: see 
how it does s_start/s_show/s_next/s_stop (or /proc/slabinfo, or vmstat, or 
any number of them).
