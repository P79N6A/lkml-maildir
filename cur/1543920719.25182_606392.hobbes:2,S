Darn. I don't read the mailing list for one day and there is a Comtrol related post. ;)
Anyhow, as far as the support address, Comtrol and Comtrol UK are now separate companies. I work for Comtrol. The address you will want to send Linux related Comtrol issues to is support@comtrol.com. You can also email me directly if you wish, as I handle Linux issues here in tech support at Comtrol. As far as changing the address in the rocket.txt file, it would be a good idea to change it to support@comtrol.com.

I've been wanting to get the driver that is included in the kernel up to date, and there is an active project here at comtrol to get the current code (driver version 3.08 beta) up to Linux kernel programming standards. The driver version that is included in the kernel (and has been patched a bit I'm sure since it's been in there a while) is version 2.09. The latest version (3.08 beta) can be obtained from: 
ftp://ftp.comtrol.com/beta/rport/drivers/u_pci/linux/rocketport-linux-3.08.tar.gz
If anyone has any helpful pointers (no pun intended) or comments on the code, I'd love to listen. 
Regards,
Nick
