You can either do
	git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
(git will set ORIG_HEAD before things like pulls or resets, so you can 
always go back), or, if you have reflogs enabled (and if you set up your 
repository with a modern git version it probably will be enabled by 
default), you can just do
	git reset --hard @{1}
where "@{1}" just means "HEAD ref state one change ago" (the same way you 
can say "@{2.hours.ago}" to mean HEAD state two hours ago).
In either case, double-check that that is indeed the version you want to 
revert to with
	git log ORIG_HEAD
 or
	git log @{1}
first, since obviously if you give "git reset --hard" the wrong version, 
it will reset to the wrong state. Although especially with reflogs, your 
previous state will always be logged, so you can always re-do what you 
undid by (again) doing "git reset --hard @{1}" to get back the previous 
state ;)
ALSO! Make sure that you don't have any dirty state in your working tree 
that you don't want to lose! "git reset --hard" will do what it implies: 
it will reset your tree. Very much including throwing away all your dirty 
state (and that you can't get back by going to a previous commit, since 
it was never committed!)
