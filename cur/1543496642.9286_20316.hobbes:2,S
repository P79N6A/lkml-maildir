What I was saying is, if you kill things with a signal when capabilities
fail, this signal should default to killing the process.  Then 
non-capability-aware stuff would just die when someone tried tricks on it.
Not the best behaviour, but possibly preferable.  I don't know if the current
behaviour is a signal or simply to fail syscalls with permission denied.
David.
