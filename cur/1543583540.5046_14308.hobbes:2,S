Yes, just as apps want <linux/*.h> files.
The kernel can have a copy. If the stack frame layout changes enough
to cause trouble with stdarg.h, then most likely there will be huge
trouble in 42 other places.
If you insist on using whatever random stdarg.h might be on the
system, then just copy it into the build area. The compile might
even run a bit faster without the extra directory to search.
