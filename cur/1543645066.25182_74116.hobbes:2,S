Ok, looks good. Except you make get_user_page() do a write fault on the 
page, and one of the points of this approach was that that shouldn't even 
be needed. Or did I miss some case that does need it?

And this makes no sense to me.
A read lock on the semaphore should give you all the same protection as a
write lock does.
To protect against the swapper etc, you really need to get the mm
spinlock, not the semaphore. And once you have the spinlock, you should be
totally safe.  Please explain what you saw?
