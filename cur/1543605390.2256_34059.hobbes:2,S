I really don't like the idea of sprinkling the magic all
around the VM subsystem, but prefer to keep the code
easier to maintain instead.
About the "undoes some inlining", I guess we might as
well mark __find_get_page() inline then so it gets
included into __find_lock_page(), after all it's the
equivalent code so it should end up the same as before.
regards,
Rik
