I'd like to clarify that I'm not trying to push this particular code to 
the kernel. I'm a researcher. My intent was to point out that we have a 
problem in the scheduler and my dwrr algorithm can potentially help fix 
it. The patch itself was merely a proof-of-concept. I'd be thrilled if the 
algorithm can be proven useful in the real world. I appreciate the people 
who have given me comments. Since then, I've revised my algorithm/code. 
Now it doesn't require global locking but retains strong fairness 
properties (which I was able to prove mathematically).
Thank you,
   tong
