Think so.  That's the only place where buffers are detached.  Otherwise,
fsync_buffers_list() looks at them all.
There's also the prune_icache() buffer-stripper remove_inode_buffers(). 
Nobody knows about the inode by that time, but there's a chance that the
inode will be rescued before it is thrown away, so remove_inode_buffers()
should propagate errors into the address_space as well.

See kswapd-writepage.c from
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/ext3-tools.tar.gz
If you run that over a filesystem which has only a few K of space, apply
memory pressure while it is sleeping then data loss will ensue.
hm, there's also enospc-writepage.c which is designed to exactly demonstrate
this problem.
