You missed the point!  Sheesh.
They know the issues and take into account the problem.
History in the past showed us the driver is superior to the BIOS setups.
This time it bites us in the arse, then kicks us.
As for OSB4 it is a dead product.
Since BroadCom killed two of my principle (trusted) contacts in
Serverworks (CEO and VP of Business) there is only one person high in the
food chain who may be trustable but I worry.
