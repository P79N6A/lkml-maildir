OK, fine.

Use what?  Would a sysfs relay file, or whatever they're called now that
relayfs is moving into sysfs, do the trick?  If so, what's a good place
to pull those patches from so I can compile-test my changes?  Should I
just grub through my archives and apply whatever Paul Mundt sent out a
few weeks ago?

If there's any documentation on what sysfs binary files are for, I
haven't seen it.  It's not in the include files, the source, or
Documentation/filesystems.

I'm fine with this rule, but accompanied how?  In a comment in the code?
In the patch description?  In the same way that sysfs binary files are
documented? :-)
Also, I'd suggest that you put a similar requirement on directories and
symlinks, if you're going to clamp down on files.
