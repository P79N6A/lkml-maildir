ap->cbl is not a reliable way to tell SATA from PATA at the moment. We
need to fix the real crashes too - right now no non PCI controller
actually works at all (crash on boot) because of the ACPI crap.
Please drop this patch as it will cause regressions on systems that do
not need the extra methods. Instead merge the one that fixe the non PCI
crashes and we might get further.

Agreed.
NAK the patch likewise.
