Well this is likely the result of the SLUB regression. If you allocate an 
order 1 page then the zone locks need to be taken. SLAB queues the a 
couple of higher order pages and can so serve a couple of requests without 
going into the page allocator whereas SLUB has to go directly to the page 
allocator for allocate and free. I guess that needs fixing in the page 
allocator. Or do I need to add a mechanism to buffer higher order page 
allcoations to SLUB?
