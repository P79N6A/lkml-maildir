0 is an EOF.

The spec says of write
DESCRIPTION
     For regular files, no data transfer will occur past the offset
     maximum established in the open file description associated with
     fildes.
     [EFBIG]
          The file is a regular file, nbyte is greater than 0 and the
          starting position is greater than or equal to the offset
          maximum established in the open file description associated
          with fildes.
Which seems to say to me that if we write > 0 bytes and we start at or
on the boundary we should error - which would agree with your change.
