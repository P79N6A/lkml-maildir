Subject: [PATCH] __crc_... is intended to be absolute
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

i386 boot/compressed/relocs checks for absolute symbols and warns about
unexpected ones.  If you build with modversions, you get ~2500 warnings
about __crc_<symbol>.  These suckers are really absolute symbols - we
do _not_ want to modify them on relocation.
They are generated by genksyms - EXPORT_... generates a weak alias, then
genksyms produces an ld script with __crc_<symbol> = <checksum> and it's
fed to ld to produce the final object file.  Their only use is to match
kernel and module at modprobe time; they _must_ be absolute.
boot/compressed/relocs has a whitelist of known absolute symbols, but
it doesn't know about __crc_... stuff.  As the result, we get shitloads
of false positives on any ld(1) version.
