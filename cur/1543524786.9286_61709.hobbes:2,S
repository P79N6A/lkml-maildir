Hello. Where are linux-kernel mailing list archives?
Absolutely no info is found from webpages of vger-machine, and
I will not request those archives which are available via e-mail,
too much trouble! FTP or www access would be fine, thanks.
I _strongly_ suggest to improve the webpages of vger-machine!!
They don't even tell how to _subscribe_ to those mailing list, nada!
