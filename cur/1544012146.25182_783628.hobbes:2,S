wait, why does this need to be changed?
People having problem with:
        u64 data;
        seq_printf(m, "%llu ", data);
This compiles fine with arch that defines u64 to unsigned long long
(like x86), but generate compile time warning on arch that defines u64
to unsigned long.
Isn't that you just need to convert format string to %llu for u64 type?
