You are entierly right. 
The primary reson of invention of /dev/random was the need
for a bit of salt to the initial packet sequence number inside
the networking code in linux. And for this purspose the
whole /dev/*random stuff is INDEED a gratitious overdesign.
For anything else crypto related it just doesn't cut the corner.
If you look at the archives I have objected it strongly in the history.
