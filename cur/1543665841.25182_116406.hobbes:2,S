I must have confused you.  I am woking on a get time of day sort of 
thing.  In time.c, the gettimeofday code calls get_offset() and then 
adds in lost ticks (ticks clocked by the PIT interrupt but not yet 
rolled into the wall clock (xtime).  I was thinking that get_offset 
might be defined to add this its result.
But, back to the problem I am trying to solve.  The posixtimers code 
is in the common kernel and needs the result returned by get_offset 
OR, we could define a new function, get_monotonictimeofday(), which 
returns the jiffies since boot + get_offset() + pending ticks (i.e. it 
would be the same as gettimeofday except it would use jiffies_64 
instead of xtime to get its result.  The format would be a timespec, 
i.e. the same as xtime.
This translates directly into a system call and is also used in the 
timers code to convert from wall clock time to jiffies time for timers.
Either way, we have a bit of a mess due to the arch dependency.  I 
don't really care which way it goes, but I do think it should be 
resolved in 2.5.
thanks
