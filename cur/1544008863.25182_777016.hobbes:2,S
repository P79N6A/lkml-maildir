Not that I think this really matters, but imho this code needs more
little trivial reorganizations.
reparent_thread() (or whatever) needs the "&ptrace_dead" parameter
too, if the new parent (init) ignores SIGCHLD we should release a
zombie. So we should rename "ptrace_dead" and ptrace_exit_finish().
And imho it makes sense to create the new helper which does
"list_for_each_entry_safe(father->children) {}", to make this code
more symmetrical() with ptrace_exit().
