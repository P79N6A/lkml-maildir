perhaps.  all i'm begging for is that these attributes be defined
cleanly and clearly, and following those two conditions i suggested
earlier:
1) all attributes are orthogonal to one another, and
2) values within an attribute are mutually exclusive
if you violate either of those conditions, i think you're going to
find it very difficult to design sane Kconfig entries around them.
if you don't believe me, give it a try.

p.s.  rather than saying that maturity can be defined "also" in
another way, you should say that it can be defined "instead" in
another way.  i don't want to think what it might mean to define
something like maturity in two different ways simultaneously, if
that's what you were suggesting.  that just makes my brain hurt.
