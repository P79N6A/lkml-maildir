Hi,
      As a part of my project on an 'enhanced VPNs', I am planning to
create multiple IPs (private IP addresses) on the same workstation (eg.
each terminal has a separate IP).  I am contemplating on replicating the
network data structures like the sk_buff queues to accomplish this task. I
would like to know if anybody knows of other alternatives to do this. 
Thanks in advance,
Vijay
