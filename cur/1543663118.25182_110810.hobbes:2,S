I've got a raid that I was running w/o a spare disk.  One of the drives
was being flakey and I restarted the machine and I was wondering if I
can recover the data on the raid.  It did not have a spare disk.  There
are 12 drives in the stripe set.  According the the logs one drive isn't
listed as a raid drive (sdi1) and the other's (sdb1) event counter is
behind.  Is there anything I can do or is it a loss and I should rebuild
the array with a hot spare :)?
I attached the logs.
Thanks for any help,
Rob
