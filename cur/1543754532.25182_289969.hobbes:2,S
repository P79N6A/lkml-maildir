Hi again,
  This may sound like a dumb idea, but I decided to remove all the disks
from the SATA controller and fiddle with the module a
bit... So... Interestingly enough, the module loads without a peep both at
the command line AND when autoloading from rc.modules AND when builtin to
a monolithic kernel!! So... The interrupt problem is coming when the
controller tries to enumerate its disks... I have verified this by
unloading the module, installing one disk, and then reinserting the
module... I get 200,000 additional interrupts on IRQ3 in /proc/interrupts
and the normal error message shown above logged to syslog for the one
disk... 
  What do you think about that??
