That can't be done just within fuse, a process might be sleeping on a
VFS mutex.  Do we want to hack VFS as well?
I guess I know your answer.  But it ain't gonna work.  Suspend code
really doesn't belong in VFS, and I'm pretty sure the maintainers of
that little piece of code would agree with me on this.
