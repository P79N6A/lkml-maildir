The problem was that foreign.h wasn't in HiSax on the time we make the
kernel update in 2.2.11, so my patch removed it because here wasn't any
reference in actual isdn code for it. 
I think foreign.h was included with some update from sparc people (Brent
Baccala) before 2.2.11.
If it 'll needed by isdn and sound in future, it should go to include/...
I think.
