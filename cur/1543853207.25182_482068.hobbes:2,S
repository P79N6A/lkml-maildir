I initially had it after the HLT in the idle loop, but realized there 
would be a small race: We could get switched away from the idle thread 
after the HLT but before doing the resynch.
It seems like idle notifiers would do the trick, except that they don't 
appear to include the id of the CPU that went/exited from idle.
Do you want me to also send a patch that addresses this?

Does the LSL from the magic GDT entry return the APIC ID or the 
smp_processor_id? If it's the latter, I can avoid using the 
smp_processor_id->apic id table completely.

Another way I could fix this would be to just touch the seqlock, in 
switch_to(), if we happen to be in vgettimeofday. Would this be acceptable?
