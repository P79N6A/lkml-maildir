I was talking about getdosattr and setdosattr (and the corresponding
pair for every other filesystem with it's own set of special
attributes).
getfattr and setfattr are standard tools already provided with the
distro.

They can. Non-ASCII xattrs are either base64 encoded or octal escaped.
Try
getfattr -n system.posix_acl_access some_file_with_an_acl
getfattr -e text -n system.posix_acl_access some_file_with_an_acl
for a quick example.

I responded to this in the other thread already.
