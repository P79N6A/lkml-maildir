Hi John,
Thanks for this exciting code. A few questions:
- Where do you intend to put the "delay" code to? Generalize it as well?
- cpufreq hooks to tsc.c and i386_tsc.c[*] can easily be added. For them to
  work _better_ than current code: can timeofday_hook() be called (with IRQs
  disabled) _anywhen_ from kernel context? 
   [*] actually, only one of them needs the notifier, AFAICS...
- what about keeping lower-priority timesources still "active" in some sort to
  a) enable loading _and_ unloading timsources (even modularizing them
	becoms possible which should make testing easier...),
  b) call them every couple of seconds to verify the currently used
	timesource is still sane (and if not, call cpufreq_delayed_get() for
	example or disable the timesource). This would mean that e.g. pmtmr 
	and pit can be used to "verify" and "backup" tsc, or otherwise... 
	The "clock=tsc" override would only affect the priority of the 
	timesource then, making it so large that no other timesource can 
	"preempt" it, but doesn't avoid making other timesources available
	for backup and verification purposes.
Thanks,
	Dominik
