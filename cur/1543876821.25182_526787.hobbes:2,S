There is one possible speedup :
- If an user app does a madvise(MADV_DONTNEED), we can assume the pages can 
later be bring back without need to zero them. The application doesnt care.
A page fault is not that expensive. But clearing N*PAGE_SIZE bytes is, because 
it potentially evicts a large part of CPU cache.
If I recall well, mysql bench Ulrich mentioned was allocating/freeing large 
areas (100 Kbytes or so) in a loop.
mmap()/brk() must give fresh NULL pages, but maybe madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) can 
relax this requirement (if the pages were reclaimed, then a page fault could 
bring a new page with random content)
