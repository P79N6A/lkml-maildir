Hi
      I have redhat6.2. I have to add ntfs support to it(defaultly
   it do not have). I know to do it by changing the configuration and
   recompiling the whole kernel. I want to know , is there any method to     
register ntfs file system without recompiling the whole kernel
   Thanks in advance
