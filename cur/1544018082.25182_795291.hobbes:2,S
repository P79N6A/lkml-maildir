Yes we should handle SIGSTOP fine if it sent from the parent namespace.
Also. Currently it is possible to ptrace the global init, but even
ptracer can't stop it (but ptrace_stop() works). With these patches
ptracer can stop init.
I forgot to mention this behaviour change, imho this side-effect
is good.
