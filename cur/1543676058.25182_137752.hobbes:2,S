Yes, with -rc6, and this:
rei $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/mwilson/largefile bs=16384 count=131072
The mouse starts skipping soon after the box starts swapping.  It
eventually catches up, but then when I start up another application, it
starts again.
I have the test running as I type this e-mail in mutt (with vim as the
editor), and there are noticeable pauses where I'm typing, but there isn't
anything happening on the screen.
It's *much* better than it was with my prior kernel (-rc2), but it's most
definately still there.
Anyone got any other test they want me to make on the box?
