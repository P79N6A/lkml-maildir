It would be precipitous to endow the IEEE definition with significant
meaning.  There is no agreement among computer scientists, engineers,
programmers, or tape-monkeys about the essential components of an
operating system.  For UN*X, a kernel without a shell is not very
useful.  It is the shell that is responsible for much of the user
experience, including the execution of programs.  Yet, the shell may
be exchanged for another piece of software.  Some people may believe
that the OS includes all of the software packaged together and
distributed as a single entity.  Others would say that the kernel and
drivers are the only true OS components.  These points of view
approximate the extremes between which most observers stand.  It is no
more likely that readers of this list will come to a consensus than
will a clutch of professors.
