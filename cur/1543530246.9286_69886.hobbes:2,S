Those 20 Apache processes each have 40Mb exclusively allocated to them.
To honour that allocation without overcommit requires 20*40 = 800Mb of VM.

The problem is, that fork() allocates memory - the same amount as the
parent process has allocated. If you want to honour this without
overcommit, you must disable COW - otherwise you've overcommitted your
memory.
