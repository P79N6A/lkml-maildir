As far as UDP HW acceleration is concerned we need to modify/verify that
Linux TCP/IP stack capable of:
1) Partial checksumming on receive
2) Checksumming over fragments on transmit
And find the NIC which capable of doing that. s2io/neterion hw do
supports those features.

Dima
Without those two, I doubt you will
