Perhaps, but I think that form is still fairly slow.  It takes an
"uncomfortable" amount of time to remove a complex directory structure
using, eg. "rm -rf /usr/src/linux-obsolete" or "rm -rf
downloads/XFree86-old-and-buggy".  I'm not sure, but I would guess it's not
as much quicker than removing each file individually as you might think.
If I had more time on my hands, I'd run some quick benchmarks on some of my
systems.
