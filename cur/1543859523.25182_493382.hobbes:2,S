Yes. I think the XFS routine should just use "clear_page_dirty_fir_io()", 
since that matches what it actually wants to do (surprise surprise, it's 
going to write it out).
HOWEVER. Why is it conditional? Can somebody who understands XFS tell me 
why "clear_dirty" would ever be 0? I can grep the sources, and I see that 
it's an unconditional 1 in one call-site, but then in the other one it 
does
	xfs_start_page_writeback(page, wbc, !page_dirty, count);
and that part just blows my mind. Why would you do a 
xfs_start_page_writeback() and _not_ write the page out? Is this for a 
partial-page-only case?
Anyway, your patch looks fine. It seems to be the right thing to do. I'm 
just wondering why we're not always cleaning the whole page, and why we'd 
not set it unconditionally dirty?
