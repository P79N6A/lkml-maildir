  Hello, guys.
  I'm curious about the cost of local_irq_enable/disable()'s on various 
architectures.  I found a freebsd discussion thread by googling which 
says that each takes 3 cycles on i386 (very cheap), but for Pentium4, 
people are talking in the order of several hundreds cycles.  Are these 
correct?  How about other architectures?
  TIA.
