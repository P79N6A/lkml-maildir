Hi list,
I can't seem to get the new 2.4.0 kernel running on a 386 CPU.
The kernel was built for a 386 Processor, Math emulation has been enabled.
I tried three different 386 boards. Execution seems to get as far as
pagetable_init() in arch/i386/mm/init.c, then it falls back into the BIOS as
if someone had pressed the reset button. The same kernel boots fine on
486 and Pentium Systems.
Any ideas/suggestions ?
Rob
