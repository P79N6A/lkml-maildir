  This check really isn't needed for shrink_dqcache() function. This function can
never recurse into fs so there's no need to have __GFP_FS set.

  OK :). If I remeber well I saw 'priority' could be 0 somewhere in the comment
and so I added +1 to avoid division by zero. But you're right that code in vmscan.c
actually never calls the functions with priority == 0.
