Is this the in-kernel driver or the one from pcmcia-cs?  I use the
in-kernel driver and pcmcia socket driver (yenta), and just use the
userspace tools from pcmcia-cs, and everything is good for me.  I never
was able to get a pure pcmcia-cs (userspace and drivers) working with my
2.6.0-test1 kernels when I tried it.
