this is the last known to me bit of compile breakage that was caused by
commit e8edc6e03a5c8562dc70a6d969f732bdb355a7e7 aka
"[PATCH] Detach sched.h from mm.h"
And after you'll check diffstat and build current kernel for different archs
yourself, I hope you'll take that "all over the place" back.
P.S.: Al may know more because he is building different set of configs, but I
      was larted about frv only.
