I presume page scanning to be rare outside memory-starved systems. I
would expect lru_cache_del() in the scanner to originate from evictions
of inodes in some odd cases, and from process or virtual area
destruction in the case of anonymous memory.

Pathetic and not particularly intelligent on the cpu designers' parts.
The L1 cache should be large enough to cover at least two base pages
and have at least as many entries as the TLB.

A large stream of faults to map in a file will blow L1 caches of the
sizes you've mentioned at every kernel/user context switch. 256 distinct
cachelines will very easily be referenced between faults. MAP_POPULATE
and mlock() don't implement batching for either ->page_table_lock or
->tree_lock, so the pagevec point is moot in pagetable instantiation
codepaths (though it probably shouldn't be).
O_DIRECT writes and msync(..., ..., MS_SYNC) will use pagevecs on
->tree_lock in a rapid-fire process-triggerable manner. Almost all
uses of pagevecs for ->lru_lock outside the scanner that I'm aware
of are not rapid-fire in nature (though there probably should be some).
IMHO pagevecs are somewhat underutilized.

Sorry, 4*lg(NR_CPUS) is 64 when lg(NR_CPUS) = 16, or 65536 cpus. 512x
Altixen would have 4*lg(512) = 4*9 = 36. The 4*lg(NR_CPUS) sizing was
rather conservative on behalf of users of stack-allocated pagevecs.
