Think so.  If an object is in its own cacheline then it won't be pingponged
around by writes to unrelated nearby objects.

A tiny bit, because the bitmaps might straddle one more cacheline than they
strictly need to.

I think readmostliness and alignment are mostly-unrelated concepts and
should have separate tag thingies.  IOW,
__cacheline_aligned_mostly_readonly goes away and to handle things like the
cpu maps we do:
char foo[8] __cacheline_aligned _mostly_readonly = { whatever };
(I shall now go away and quietly tear my hair out.  Those mostly-readonly
patches caused a mountain of grief:
optimise-storage-of-read-mostly-variables.patch
optimise-storage-of-read-mostly-variables-fix.patch
optimise-storage-of-read-mostly-variables-x86_64-fix.patch
optimise-storage-of-read-mostly-variables-x86_64-fix-fix.patch
optimise-storage-of-read-mostly-variables-x86_64-fix-fix-fix.patch
move-some-more-structures-into-mostly_readonly-and-readonly.patch
kexec-x86_64-optimise-storage-of-read-mostly-variables-x86_64-fix.patch
Once this is sorted I'll drop the lot and we start from a clean slate).
