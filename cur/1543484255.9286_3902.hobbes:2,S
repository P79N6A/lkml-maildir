A lot of swapping is going on. Perhaps someone has an idea of what is
the problem. And when I do a shutdown, I get tons of swap errors on the screen.
The problem doesn't exist with 2.2.0, if it is I haven't noticed.
It is worst with Netscape loaded but not too bad shortly after a reboot.
It takes 15 to 20 minutes to get the heavy swapping.
I have a 686 with 40meg of ram and one 64 meg of swap. I was getting
attempt to write past the end message on my other swap partition (end of 2G drive)
so I disabled it.
I am currently not on the newsletter.
