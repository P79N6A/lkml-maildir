Sam,
how can I include the "legal way" includes for comedi? Just now comedi 
has set up a "linux/include" path in its directory but I think this not 
the elegant way and it also dosn't work right now.
snoopy:/home/bp1/c/usb/2.6/comedi/comedi# make -C 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.0-test2 SUBDIRS=$PWD V=1 modules
make: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.6.0-test2'
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=scripts
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/i386/kernel 
arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
*** Warning: Overriding SUBDIRS on the command line can cause
***          inconsistencies
mkdir -p .tmp_versions
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=/home/bp1/c/usb/2.6/comedi/comedi
