Hate to hear this - 2.0 is said to work _flawlessly_ on 2.4.24 and
on 2.6.2 within the bounds of more complex PM/driver issues.
2.4.25 and 2.6.3 patches are undergoing testing.
If you like to try again, please have a look at 
http://swsusp.sf.net
.
There is also comprehensive FAQ and Howto on the site.
You also will find a lot of user support wrt specific HW.
Myself is running 2.0 on 2.4.2[345] without any stability issues
whatsoever this year.
In short, I am confident we can make it work for you!
Regards
Michael
