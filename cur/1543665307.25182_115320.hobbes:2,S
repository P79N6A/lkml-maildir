The 5Mb example is AIX.

I said userspace.  I did not say existing binaries.

You are asserting aesthetics instead of benefits.  I asked about benefits.
Specifically, what is the benefit of compact?
I'm sure you have a very good technical or business benefit to compact, 
but those of us in the world of workstations and servers have zero clue 
what it may be.
Another individual has already indicated a very valid technical merit to
having it all in one file.  I have the same problem myself.  AIX and *BSD
have a working approach to that problem.

User space solution is not the same as a solution implemented with
multiple user space apps.

Perhaps you could explain why today is not the day.
(ie, soon to be shipping product that requires it.  desire to see a viable
userspace solution working before it is removed).
