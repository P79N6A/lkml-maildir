There is more going on than this, XFS suffered a major slowdown in some
metadata write only benchmarks - the file create/delete phase of 
bonnie++. Now thats a single app only doing writes. Slowdown on the
order of 500% to 600%. Since we did not follow the pre kernels in
2.4.20 we do not really know when it was introduced and there is
a possibility XFS itself has not followed some api change.
