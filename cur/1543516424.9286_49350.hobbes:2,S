I am trying to use an iomega buz board in my linux box (running 2.3.28).
The board has a NatSemi PicoPower PCI-to-PCI bridge on it, and a Zoran and
Advansys SCSI controller on the far side of the bridge.  However, the
latter two devices are not getting detected by linux, as the pci-pci
bridge does not appear to be getting setup.
lspci -v for the bridge:
00:0b.0 PCI bridge: PicoPower Technology: Unknown device 0004 (rev 01)
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32
        Bus: primary=00, secondary=02, subordinate=02, sec-latency=32
        Memory behind bridge: e8000000-e80fffff
lspci -n for the bridge:
00:0b.0 Class 0604: 1066:0004 (rev 01)
How can I get linux to scan the far side?  I assume this used to work in
2.2.x, as the drivers (drivers/char/buz.[ch]) for this board do not
include any fiddling with the bridge itself.
