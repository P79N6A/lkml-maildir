works fine here now. The whole NUMA code is still quite hackish in 
general, (including most of arch/x86_64/*/*.c), so i'd not judge based 
on that.

well. 32bit itself is broken by design, if you consider RAM larger than 
say 1GB.

it's an enabler of a feature-set that i couldnt test on these boxes 
otherwise. Look at it like the highmem= boot option. Or consider it a 
primitive form of NUMA emulation.

maybe due to the zone alignment problem?
