That's not my argument.  I realize that external hardware on a PCI bus
_has_ to be asynchronous, simply because it is so slow. 
The question I have is whether such external hardware is even worth it
any more for any standard crypto work.  With a regular PCI bus
fundamentally limiting throughput to something like a maximum of 66MB/s
(copy-in and copy-out, and that's so theoretical that it's not even
funny - I'd be surprised if RL throughput copying back and forth over a
PCI bus is more than 25-30MB/s), I suspect that you can do most crypto
faster on the CPU directly these days. 
Maybe not. The only numbers I have is the slowness of PCI.
