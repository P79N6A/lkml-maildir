Hi,
Is there is any way to use a robust futex without an associated mutex?
In the kernel, exit_robust_list only handles futexes associated with a mutex (through futex_offset).
Implementation of pthread_cond_xxx (broadcast, wait, ...) functions uses several futexes (lll_lock) in glibc which cannot be handled as robust.
However a thread locking one of these internal futexes can be killed while there are other waiters.
Am I right?
Thanks.
