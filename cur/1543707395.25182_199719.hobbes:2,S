x86-64 it is. Maybe you can remap one of your function keys to send the 
sequence ;)
This whole "ia32" crap has always been ridiculous - nobody has _ever_ 
called an x86 anything but x86, and Intel is just making it worse by 
adding random illogical letters to the end.
In contrast, x86-64 tells you _exactly_ what it's all about, and is what 
the kernel has always called the architecture anyway.
