And ... what do we do when we reach that point ?
It's obvious that we need load control to make the machine
survive at that point; load control is a horrible measure
which will make interactivity very bad, but will cause the
box to survive where otherwise it would be thrashing.
Having a better paging system would mean having the 'thrashing
point' (where we need to kick in load control' much further
out and being able to keep the system behave better under
heavier VM loads.

Rik
