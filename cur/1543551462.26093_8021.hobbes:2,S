	RTFM. Take any manual on x86 architecture and stare at the
pictures. Ones that describe how segments work. Real mode: 16:16 ->
21 or 20. Real mode with undocumented twists: 16:16->21->32 (you _can_ get
paging with real mode style of segments). 286 protected mode: 16:16 -> 24.
Ditto with twists: 16:16->24->32. 386 protected mode: 16:32->32.
Ditto with paging: 16:32->32->32. Ditto with PAE: 16:32->32->36.
In _all_ cases you are limited by the size of linear address. I.e. all
address modes are limited to 4Gb. All you can get from PAE is placing of
these 4Gb in 64Gb of physical memory.
