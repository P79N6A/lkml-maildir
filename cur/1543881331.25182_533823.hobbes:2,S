containers is actually relevant because everything not being converted
to a kthread API is actually show stopper issue for the development of
the pid namespace because of the usage of pids by kernel_thread, and
the apparent impossibility to fix daemonize to sort this out.
Now I do agree linux-ia64 is also relevant.
