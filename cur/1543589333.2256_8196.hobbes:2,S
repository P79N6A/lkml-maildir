Would it make sence to have libc use the magic page for all syscalls? Then
on cpus with a fast syscall instruction, the magic page could contain the
needed junk in userspace to use it.
(i.e. that really should be in libc, but we don't want libc to contain all
sorts of CPU specific cruft.. or is there a more general way to accomplish
this?)
