Infact people is starting to report that its machine clock is losing time.
I am fixing it right now. The inserted code is
really minimal and I think that it worth to have at least the timer irq
relialable even if irq are disabled on both CPU for a long time.
I think the main irq bottleneck right now is the scsi subsystem locking
that according to me has to be rewritten using failsafe mechanizm (not
spinning spinlocks).
