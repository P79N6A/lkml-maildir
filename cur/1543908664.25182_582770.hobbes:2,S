Hmm, it was really worth of it, I did:
$ git-fetch linus
$ git-reset --hard linus
[...make & install & boot...]
...and voila, the problem went away, so something else seems to have
fixed it between: ac07860264bd and 963c6527e0a0e. As you can notice,
I didn't even have to revert it (I was just double checking current
mainline first).
Is there a need to get a more detailed view about the cause or something, 
or are details of this issue clear enough to everyone? I can do some more 
research if necessary, though expect a bit longer latencies during the 
next week...
In case none, thanks everyone, this issue seems solved. :-)
