Indeed, that looks pretty subtle. 
James: Brian's patch looks obviously correct to me (scsi_alloc_sdev() will 
have called scsi_sysfs_device_initialize() which will set up the release 
function to free the queue). 
This code has been like that forever, though, which makes me wonder. Can 
anybody see what has changed to make the bug trigger? Or is there 
something I'm missing?
