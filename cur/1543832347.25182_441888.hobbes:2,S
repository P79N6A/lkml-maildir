Why not? You use libextfs or how is it called to read the file from
the disk directly (read-only access), then you write it back using
regular calls.
Of course, you can end up with "deleted" data being corrupted if
kernel reused the area before undelete, or while you were doing
undelete... but that's expected. They were _deleted_, right?
