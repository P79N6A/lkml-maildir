I would consider 2.0.111 to be of GAMMA quality myself... it's certainly
more stable than 2.2.0 has proven to be. ;-)
Ulrich wanted to do a real release for a few weeks now, but you know how it
is... all those pesky little bugs creeping up at the last minute, partly
because there are features glibc needs to track; the vfork() mess, for
instance -- people did end up with kernel+glibc combinations which were
dead ends, which is a big no-no.
