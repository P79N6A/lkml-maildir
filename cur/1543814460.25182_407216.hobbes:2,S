Let see:
0 is an interger zero. It is not a null pointer.
1 is an interger one
NULL is an null pointer
We agree so far?
And you say:
0 is also false
1 is also true
But others say:
0 is not false, only false is false.
1 is not true, only true is true.
Thats more readable. No magic = 1; assignments or return 1; things.
Then we will have the case where a 1 is transformed to a true, and
likewise a 0 to a false. But thats just normal type conversion.
I assume that when you are not used to see 'bool', 'true' and 'false'
then they hurt the eye, but when used to it it looks natural.
