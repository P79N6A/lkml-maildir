I tried an old and two new disks, all showed massive corruption. I don't
use the Zip drive much, so I really don't know when it started. At first I
thought I had screwed up and got the stuff again (RedHat updates).

No, I'm quite aware of that, and have (had?) my setup working (mtools and
mounting as VFAT). I usually use Zip disks to transport stuff between a
RedHat-5.2 system at work (works flawlessly) and my hacked RedHat-6.0
system at home (massive corruption on writing, even just mounting the disk
and trying to copy something off it triggers it). I'll check the RedHat-6.0
updated kernel later, will see what happens. Haven't been able to try the
latest breaking kernels (2.3.9 up to 2.3.10pre3), as either ppa or the SCSI
modules get undefined symbols on loading. Will check 2.3.10-pre4...
Thanks!
