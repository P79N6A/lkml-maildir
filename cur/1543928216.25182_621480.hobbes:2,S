Exactly.  Why exactly should someone not write a new TCP congestion module?

He didn't justify those though, either.

Right.  So presumably there will only ever be two drivers using this core 
code, so no new users will ever be written?  Now we've found one use case, is 
it worth the complexity of namespaces?  Is it worth the halfway point of 
export-to-module?
What problem will it solve?

No, we've seen the solution and various people applying it.  I'm still trying 
to discover the problem it's solving.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
