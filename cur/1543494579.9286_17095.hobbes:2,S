You are not allowed to sleep there, exactly as you are not allowed
to sleep during hard_start_xmit. Essentially, set_multicast_list status
is equal to hard_start_xmit.
If the operation cannot be complete without delay, you must defer it
to timer. If you need make some post-processing after IRQ from card,
you can start task queue in irq handler.
