in my world, we design stuff, calculate bigO, then
implement and finally measure. we don't write code at
inspiration and then measure and if kinda s*x we apply
patches then measure again, etc etc etc, that's _all_
i meant... (keep measuring something not really
designed for this O or that O may be a huge waste of
time). even in qa, the best engineers find
short-cuts... even in black box testing, but then you
get gray box, and white box testing and finally us
(r&d).

correct, but you should measure something which you
first designed then implemented... not the other way
around...

hey, absolutely... i was about to add that too (last
night) but it was kinda late... but how would you
define "secure"... it's kinda like huge, eh? in my
$0.02, secure means secure enough for the purpose
(whatever that may be...) and it's way over the scope
of this email... when this is equivalated with "oh,
it's kinda slow, but it's worth cause it's safer"...
well, i kinda have doubts on that... (check for a
second oppinion in your sec strategy, etc...)

well, yes and now... it's a long story...

yeah... remember the old days (running around with
floppies because networking was "unsafe" blah blah
blah...)
nice talking 2u bill,
