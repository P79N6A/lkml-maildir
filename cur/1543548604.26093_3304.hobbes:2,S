If you're logging in as root, this is probably a result of the VT not
being named in /etc/securetty.  Devfsd mucks up the names, so you can
either include "1," which would allow root logins from pseudo-terminals
and other insecure places, or upgrade your util-linux to a newer
version; I'm not sure what is new enough.
