Whats wrong with the existing MGEODEGX1 define (other than it doesn't
say AMD)

Is this correct - last time I benchmarked it the older GEODE was better
off using non MMX copies ?

This is wrong - a GEODE kernel can support APIC even if the Geode itself
doesn't. Remeber it is *optimised for at least... * not "xyz only"

Kernel space enables Cyrix MMX on the processors it knows about that it
can. Some userspace will use the extensions if present. The Cyrix init
code you unplugged it from knows how to do this which your unfinished
patch doesn't.
