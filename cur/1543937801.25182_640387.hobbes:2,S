Well, sorry for consuming your time with this very small change, but I'm
not sure I understand what you're suggesting... Here's what I'd do:
    * I'd define  CONFIG_PCSPEAKER for x86 (typically in
      arch/x86/Kconfig), to be set to "y"  when CONFIG_INPUT_SPKR is
      set. This is what minimizes the changes to make.
    * This way, we can just have:
      obj-$(CONFIG_PCSPEAKER) += pcspeaker.o
Did I understand things right? Anyway, the current situation is not so
bad either.

Sounds fine! Don't hesitate to let us know about the lower-hanging fruit
you're thinking about. Here are the main things I have so far:
    * Ideas in the existing Linux-Tiny patchset.
    * Disable support for non-Intel processors in x86 (cyrix.c,
      centaur.c, transmeta.c, nexgen.c, umc.c in arch/x86/kernel/cpu).
      As far as I remember, I saved 15 KB when I first experimented with
      this).
    * Disable support for readahead, page writeback, pdflush and swap
      when we have no storage at all (typically booting from an
      initramfs). This corresponds to 69 KB of source code!
So, more ideas are welcome!
Thanks for your time,
Michael.
