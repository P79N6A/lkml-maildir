Theodore,
Will you please check to see why recent kernels won't hang up the
modem when the baud-rate is set to B0.
I've tried every-possible user-space combination including zeroing
the whole 'struct termios' structure.
Looking at the code, I think old_termios->c_flag will always be
zeroed (can't see where it is ever set). This will prevent
your transition into/out-of B0 status (line 2173 of serial.c)
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
