Normally you obtain access to your devices' memory-mapped RAM
(or anything else) by using ioremap_nocache(). If you want to
leave it cached (for speed), you use ioremap(). In that case,
you can do a single dummy read from the same page that you
want updated, just before you do whatever required the
synchronization. This often gives better overall performance.
With shared RAM, the CPU (and its cache) doesn't know that
the RAM was written by some other device. Therefore, if this
is important, you need to leave it uncached.
FYI, the "nocache" doesn't affect the PCI FIFO. Therefore stuff
on the PCI Bus remains cached (sort of) anyway. Because of this,
you may need to force all PCI Bus writes to complete by doing a
dummy read before any important stuff anyway.
