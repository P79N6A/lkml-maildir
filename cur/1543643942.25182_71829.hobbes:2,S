what's the point of moving rx handling into rx_poll then running it in a
tasklet? I've tested an older variant of that scheme from D-Link and it
doesn't perform as well as my patch. It looks to me like an attempt to
keep this version synced with the NAPI version of the driver, but it
doesn't actually work very well.
The functional part of my patch was just taking the tx handling from
d-link's driver and ditching the rx part.  That and merging in the
cleanups from Becker's driver; most notably ignoring the broken
IntrRxDone bit.
