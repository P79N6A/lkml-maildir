Hello!
At last I fixed my problem! I changed source to not enable "Host
Protected Area". This means that on 2.6.10 I have 33,8GB disk, not
40GB, how on "true" 2.6.10. And now my BIOS detect my disk. But
question is, what does "true" kernel do, and why influence to BIOS?
Maybe this is kernel BUG?
Here is my diff's file. Maybe my patch is primitive, but it works.
Maybe somebody will do better patch.
My patch:

I want to thank all who helped me and I wish a Happy New Year!
