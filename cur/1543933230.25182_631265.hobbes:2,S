I don't see where srp_cleanup_module() is calling srp_remove_host().
That is the likely way that transport devices should be made to go
away.  Something on the order of srp_remove_work().
Or srp_remove_one() except with a call to srp_remove_host() may be
necessary.  In fact, maybe just adding that call will fix it, as
ib_unregister_client should drive the remove function.  Guesses, all
this.
