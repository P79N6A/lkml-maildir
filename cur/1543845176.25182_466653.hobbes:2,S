Subject: [SYSFS] Add a declaration for fs_subsys
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The fs_subsys of sysfs does not have a declaration in any header
file, despite it being an exported symbol. This patch adds one so
that modules don't have to add their own. This is something used
by GFS2 (and already in the GFS2 tree) but I think can safely be
considered generic infrastructure.
