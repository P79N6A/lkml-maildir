Is there anything in the kernel that shifts the physical pages for 1024
physically allocated and contiguous virtual pages together physically
and remaps them as one huge page?  This would probably work well for the
low end of the heap, until someone figures out a way to tell the system
to free intermittent pages in a big mapping (if the heap has an
allocation up high, it can have huge, unused areas that are allocated).
 It may possibly work for disk cache as well, albeit I can't say for
sure if it's common to have a 4 meg contiguous section of program data
loaded.
Shifting odd huge allocations around would be neat to, re:
{2m}[4M  ]{2m}  ->  [4M  ][4M  ]
