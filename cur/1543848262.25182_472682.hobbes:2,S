I also tried to gdb the vmcore file but I got errors too.
gdb vmcore.test
GNU gdb Red Hat Linux (6.3.0.0-1.96rh)
This GDB was configured as
"x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu"..."/scratch/vmcore.test": not in executable
format: File format not recognized
Could someone here points me to the right directions or links to
troubleshoot kernel panic?
Thank you very much.
