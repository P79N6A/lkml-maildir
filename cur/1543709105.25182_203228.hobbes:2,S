I can confirm that it is not highmem related because today we had the same 
lockup on 2.4.25 wo/highmem. Only thing left to be ruled out is grsec patch. 
It will be tested soon and then I will inform you.
What is the status of megaraid2 driver? Is it safe to use it in production or 
that isn't recommended?
