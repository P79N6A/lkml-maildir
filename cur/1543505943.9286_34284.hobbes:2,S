Subject: [patch] possible SMP races all over the place in wait_event interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Maybe I am dreaming, but it seems to me that the wait_even interface has
SMP races. To make it SMP safe we should enforce read and write ordering
in the wait_event code.
Take for example the wait_on_buffer/unlock_buffer code.
The wakeup interface should write to the bus the cleared bit _before_
reading the state of the current task in wake_up_process.
The sleep interface should write to the bus the UNINTERRUPTIBLE state of
the process _before_ reading if the locked bit is set or not.
The ordering is the basic rule of the wait_even interface and the way we
avoid deadlocking after missing an event.
So if I am not dreaming patches like the one below should be applyed all
over the place: (against 2.3.13)

Comments? If I am right I can start to fix such SMP race in all the
kernel.
