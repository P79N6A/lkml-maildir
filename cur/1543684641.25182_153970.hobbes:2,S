check /var/log/message, did you get something like:

it shows that even though the laptop "freezes", the
laptop is still functioning. i just can't bring it
back to life or resume it. network is down, evident
from my getmail logs.
radeontool is simply a userspace tool that turns off
your lcd backlight.
