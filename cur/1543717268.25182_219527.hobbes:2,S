This is true to a surprising extent.  A couple of weeks ago I observed my
256MB box freeing over 20MB of pages before it could successfully acquire a
single 1-order page.
That was during an updatedb run.
And a 1-order GFP_NOFS allocation was actually livelocking, because
!__GFP_FS allocations aren't allowed to enter dentry reclaim.  Which is why
VFS caches are now forced to use 0-order allocations.
