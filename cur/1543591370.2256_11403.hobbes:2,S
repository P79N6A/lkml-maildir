Most people have both.  However, if your distribution installs bison
and not yacc and does *NOT* install the "bison as yacc" wrapper, you
should complain to your distributor.
As far as "not always an option", that's ridiculous.  If there really
isn't someone around who can install it globally, then put it in ~/bin
and set your PATH.
The command "yacc" should be expected to work.  This is as insane as
the flamage in the cdrecord documentation about Linux installing GNU
make as "make".
