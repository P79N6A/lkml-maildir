I found this article pretty fascinating and gave me some new ideas for
kernel coding and other goodies.  Looks like the good ole ASUS P55T2P4
w/ the 200mhz K6 in the house will be getting a K6-3 eventually. You might
wonder 'Why bother?' but the current setup loves 83mhz bus and it's got
a decent chipset. :)
83 * 5.5 = ~456mhz
This compares the decode/execute engines of the K6 & PII.
PII is a faster decoder and K6 is a faster executor.
