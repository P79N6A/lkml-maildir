Just to be sure, something like this will work well, and bring you down
to one program executed per test:
        $(findstring /,$(shell gcc -print-file-name=libcurses.so))
You have to check for a "/" in the output, as -print-file-name will
print its input unmodified if it can't actually find the file you
specify.
