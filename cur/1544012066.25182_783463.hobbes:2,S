Think for a minute
a) you might have any number of links to given inode, *including* *zero*
b) any subset of these links may be in dcache (including empty)
c) any number of bindings might exist to file in question *or* to its
ancestors (again, including zero).
d) none of the relative paths from fs root to file has to be visible
as a path leading to file in question from anywhere (again, think of
bindings)
e) all of that can change before information reaches userland.

_WHAT_ interface without races?  Anything along the lines of "somebody had
done something to <pathname>" is racy by definition.  Simply because the
next operation might have changed the mapping from pathnames to files.
What are you actually trying to do?
