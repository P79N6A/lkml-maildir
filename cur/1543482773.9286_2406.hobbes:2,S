I got to this conclusion after reading more manuals.
In that case open(2) should have already failed with EOVERFLOW:
[EOVERFLOW]
        The named file is a regular file and the size of the file canno
        be represented correctly in an object of type off_t. 
(similar errors in stat, lstat and some other system calls)...
In theory, it is possible that a process will inherit a file descriptor
that already points to a file over 2GB or that some other process
will write to a file and make it over 2GB after it was opened. I
believe (please correct me if I'm wrong) that this can not (yet!)
happen in Linux (at least not on any 32 bit arch and with the file
systems that come with the kernel source.
