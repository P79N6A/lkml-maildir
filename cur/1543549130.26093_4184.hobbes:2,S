http://cscope.sourceforge.net/

I just tried it with the open sourced cscope, and it works on that line
just fine.  It (the cscope) still needs a little work in some areas, but
it seems fairly decent to me.

You can submit a kernel patch if you think it'll get accepted... it's
a trivial enough hack... but no guarantees.

Try using the open source cscope... this isn't a bug there, and if you
do run into any, you can always email me (or submit to cscope's
sourceforge site) patches to it.
Good luck. :)
