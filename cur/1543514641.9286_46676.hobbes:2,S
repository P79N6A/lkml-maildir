yes and no. It is probably too expensive to run every minute - yes.
But it takes less time than initialization of scsi bus (that happens after
you do insmod or some error occurs).
Face it - changing cpu speed is a _change_ in system configuration.
Also can someone remind me what rdtsc does ? I thought it counted clock
cycles. The point of bogomips calculation is to find out how many cycles
in a second there really are.
The other clock source might be memory bus - anyone heard of memory bus
changing speed on the fly ?
