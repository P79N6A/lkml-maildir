In the case of the LRW use in dm-crypt only plain- and ciphertext need
to be accessible through struct page (both are addressed through BIO
vectors). The LRW tweaks could simply be kmalloced. So instead of
passing "struct scatterlist *tweaksg" we could just pass a "void
*tweaksg".
Some of the hard work on the generic scatterlist walker would be for
nothing then. :(
