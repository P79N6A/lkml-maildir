Right. I'm just having a bit of trouble understanding what you're
really asking for. I think it's something along the lines of:
  * A light-weight interface for doing DMA transfers
  * Still, this interface must be able to handle all kinds of controller-
    specific bells and whistles
  * Those bells and whistles should be configurable per-transfer, not
    only per-channel.
So how about we provide:
  * A hook for changing the default channel settings (many of which may
    really be per-transfer; this depends on the specific controller)
  * A hook for changing the settings of a descriptor after it has been
    prepared with the default settings.
Both of these hooks may take a controller-specific struct, or possibly
a standard struct that can be extended by the controller. This would
ensure that transfers using default settings are still reasonably fast,
while clients with controller-specific knowledge can still tweak things.
We could also let the controller extend the dma_device struct to add
such hooks on its own.
How does that sound?

Ok, maybe I did. But I'm not sure if it actually matters to my
argument. A device supporting "logical" channels in hardware could
still have a driver that pretends it has even more "logical" channels.

Yes, I think this may allow us to move quite a few settings from
"per-transfer" to "per-channel" territory, which would simplify things
and reduce the transfer setup overhead.

Right, but such quirks tend to be very chip-specific, or even specific
to a certain chip revision. So I really think this information
ultimately needs to come from the platform code, but we should perhaps
think about how to pass this information through the client driver and
into the DMA engine driver.

What do we put in it though? The only thing we really need is some sort
of type id so that clients can know what type to throw at container_of.
If you mean "struct engine_type" should be controller-specific, we
still need a type ID to determine what kind of type it really is.

Not all drivers may need any platform data. The engine driver must be
able to distinguish between the dma_slave structs that have additional
data attached to them and those that don't.
But if container_of() turns out to make things cleaner, and these
issues can be solved some other way, sure.
