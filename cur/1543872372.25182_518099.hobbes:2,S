The device seems to be recognized properly.
Here's (part of) the dmesg output:

where stat was assigned as 'u8 stat=hwif->INB(IDE_STATUS_REG)'
It seems to me that the status is good until it tries to read the
partition table...
In fact, after I do
sfdisk -R /dev/hdc
every other reading from compact flash (if ever does not get 'lost
interrupt) generates the message
 hdc: status error: status=0x58 {...}

I intended:
I disabled 'Use PCI DMA by default when available' in the kernel,
because I did not know the ide=nodma option.
It works, of course.

I tried to #if 0 all the function, without changes.
I tried modifying the function:
static void ide_disk_init_mult_count(ide_drive_t *drive)
{
    drive->mult_count = 0;
    struct hd_driveid *id = drive->id;
    id->max_multsect = 0;
    id->multsect_valid = 0;
    drive->mult_req = 0;
    drive->special.b.set_multmode = 0;
}
with the same result:
> # hdparm -I /dev/hdc

I notice that sfdisk -R causes to read 8 sectors, while sfdisk -l will
read 32 sectors...
