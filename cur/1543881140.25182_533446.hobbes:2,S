Because if we remove the obsolete label the users are going to be
suprised when it goes away entirely with && BROKEN or && !HOTPLUG or
similar.

Want to be on that. There is nobody maintaining it. That isn't a
sustainable situation so it will break.

Ok then it should be marked "BROKEN" instead.

For simile changes they have kept it going (eg the tty changes), but the
code is too big and too messy for that to happen for all things. Thus
it will eventually break

No risk of deadlock. It'll progress to && BROKEN which will either cause
sufficient pain for someone to get off their arse and fix it, for enough
of a vendors users to get the vendor to do the work or for someone who
cares to pay a third party to do the work.
