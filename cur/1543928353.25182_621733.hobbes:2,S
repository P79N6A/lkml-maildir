Yes, I believe you are correct.  It is my understanding that 
expansion ROM space is not "required" to be non-prefetchable
but "can be" non-prefetchable.  Since it "can be" non-prefetchable
it is also my understanding that the BIOS can assume that the
kernel will allocate expansion ROM space from the non-prefetch
window if sufficient space exists there.  The BIOS does this to
conserve PCI memory to make more space available to other PCI
devices (already installed or may be hotplugged) in the large
number of other PCI slots that exist in a multi-node system.
For example, I believe the minimum p2p bridge window size is
1MB so if the BIOS determines that all the PCI memory needs
(including expansion ROMs) for devices below the bridge can
be satisfied from a 1MB non-prefetch window, it can provide
(via _CRS) only 1MB of PCI memory for the non-prefetch window
and nothing for a prefetch window.  If the kernel strictly
requires expansion ROM space to be allocated from a prefetch
window the BIOS would have to provide an additional 1MB of PCI
memory for a prefetch window.  So, in this example the kernel
wants 2MB (1MB for non-prefetch window, 1 MB for prefetch window)
but the BIOS only provides 1MB for the non-prefetch window.
I hope this makes more sense now.

Sounds like I better get to work. :)
Thanks,
