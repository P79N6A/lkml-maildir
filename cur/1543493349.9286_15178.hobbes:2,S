Alan hacked the MTRR driver in the official tree some time after I
wrote a patch which re-organised the MTRR driver to cleanly support
non-Intel MTRRs. I wrote the patch because I was being sent patches
for Cyrix MTRR (ARR) support by Zoltan Boszormenyi. I then noticed
Alan had added AMD MTRr support in his patches, so I contacted him.
We agreed that his changes would be merged into my patch which would
eventually make it into Linus' tree.
So, my patch has code for AMD MTRRs which is based on Alan's patch,
although the structure is different because the AMD code is now just
one "driver" amongst others (Intel and Cyrix), rather than a straight
hack.

Yep, AMD has only two MTRRs. Bugger. I don't know if we can do
anything (other than suggest a better CPU:-). You could help us by
benchmarking which region is more useful to set to write-combining.
We can then put it in a FAQ.
One trick: if the FB and voodoo2 memory are contiguous (or at least,
nothing sits between them), you could make a single MTRR region which
covers both. If you're paranoid, you can use the PCD and PWT bits in
the page tables to turn off write-combining in the intervening region.
