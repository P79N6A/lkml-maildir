it checks the remaining free memory every n seconds and creates
swapfiles by n size if needed
the README:
swapd 0.2 (May 21, 2000), copyright Neven Lovric <nlovric@linux.hr>
swapd is a dynamic swapping manager for Linux. It provides the system with
as much swap space (virtual memory) as is required at a particular time by
dynamicly creating swap files. This is more convinient than using
fixed swap
files and/or partitions because they (a) are unused most of the time
and are
just taking up disk space; and (b) provide a limited amount of virtual
memory.
