The answer is actually "all of the above". Axis has a CVS tree
that has gotten out of sync with mainline (although we've continued
to merge new releases regularly into our CVS).
This means that the CRISv10 architecture has gotten broken in mainline,
but we've done the corrections in our CVS.
My patches up to now has been focused on merging the ones that
makes the architecture compile.
There's the CRISv32 architecture for the Etrax FS chip (which I'm not
sure if it actually has worked at any time, since it is missing a
number of key drivers like ethernet and serial) which is a working
architecture here at Axis.
There's also a new chip Artpec-3 which is based on the CRISv32
architecture, and shares most (if not all) drivers with Etrax FS,
but has some different hardware configuration.
Lastly, there's a number of changes that are general bugfixes or
improvements but are not required to compile.
The ultimate goal is to get where our tree tracks mainline
as close as possible.

Yes, that would be great.

Yes, it is certainly so when the file defines __INLINE__ to be inline.
I'll submit a later patch that removes this.

Yup, I've actually used tabs on purpose to cut down on checkpatch
warnings, with just the intention of submitting the complete reformatting
as a separate patch later.

Ok, will do.
Thanks a lot for your time!
