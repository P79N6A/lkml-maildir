the buffering is the heart of the problem. some of us would like to
use linux in real time music performance situations (*). that means i want
to be able to twiddle some feature of a MIDI instrument, and get the
relevant audio output soon enough that if i'm working with other
people whose instruments are *not* routed through my computer, we
sound in sync with each other.
this means not much more than 5-10ms of buffering. by linux standards,
this is rather small, and in fact, would still be considered a delay
with a distinct name (flanging) in the audio world.

very true, but you still have to work like crazy to get linux to
cooperate with such low latency goals. ensuring that different i/o
subsystems do not block each other (e.g. disk, audio, serial port,
parallel port) will go a long way to helping this problem.
--p
(*) partly because it won't crash in the middle of a performance, and
partly because its a great platform for developing interesting
software on.
