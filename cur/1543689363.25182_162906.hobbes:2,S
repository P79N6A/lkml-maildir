Jamie,
	Just wondered if the store buffer is snooped in some 
architectures. In that case I believe the OS need not do anything for 
serialization (except for aliases, if they do not hit the same cache line). 
In x86 store buffer is not snooped which leads to all these serialization 
issues (other CPUs looking at stale value of data which is in the store 
buffer of some other CPU).
Pl correct me if I have got anything wrong/
Thanx,
tomar
