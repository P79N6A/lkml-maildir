How can this happen?  You're taking the address of dev->sdev_gendev, so it
can't be NULL:
struct device * get_device(struct device * dev)
{
        return dev ? to_dev(kobject_get(&dev->kobj)) : NULL;
}
(kobject_get returns its argument).

to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
