FUSE?
I don't see any advantage of holding it off any more.
I feel the slightest of distrust towards the usefulness or quality of
FUSE.  Anyway if the users aren't interested enough to complain about
inclusion, it's not really worth it for me to pursue.
So I'll just shut up now, and let nature take it's course.
