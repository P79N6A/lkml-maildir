Your point 2 isn't user space though.
Also, it's buggy.  Consider a SCSI PCMCIA card with SCSI disks attached.
When you eject that card, your SCSI disks disappear, yet they aren't
marked as removable.  If user space is relying on /sys/block/*/removable
to tell it if things may go away, then user space is buggy.
Maybe it's for devices which may be present (eg, floppy driver), but
which have removable media (eg, floppy disk), rather than removable
devices?
