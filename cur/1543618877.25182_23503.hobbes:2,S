Hi. As I stated before I get "Spurious interrupts on IRQ7" ony many
(all?) systems (from AMD-K62/Ali, over Pentium-II to AMD-K7-XP/SiS)
with the latest kernels. I started arround 2.4.14/15 ... - None system
has anything attached to the LPT port ...
I'll try to find some time to reboot some to see where it started ...
