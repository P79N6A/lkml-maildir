Ugh. If bandwidth is a problem, charge them by the Gb and let them save
money by reducing their usage via the W3 cache.

SMTP wasn't designed to expect people to 'steal' another persons machine
and bandwidth as a third-party exploder.

Alan was suggesting that providers use transproxy to filter mail.

Thats not true. I'm quite familiar with what ARIN wants, and I've got more
then a few IP addresses under my belt (GFM1-ARIN). They basically want you
to have a single address per possible simultaneous system. For broadband
users, that would mean every user. For dialup with a typical 8:1
user:modem ratio, it's a little different.
