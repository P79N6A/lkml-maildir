Any measurements to show that this is a real problem? My intuition
is that the simple Linux model has enormous advantages over
more complex schemes. For one thing, using irq levels  makes it 
very easy to introduce impossible to find synchronization bugs. 
Down in the interior of the scsi code, someone uses the wrong irq
level and the serial driver starts dropping bytes every now and
then.  For another, RTLinux depends on a Linux to have a sensible
and clear interrupt model.  I very much doubt we could have 
made RTLinux work if Linux was trying to be too clever about 
interrupt priorities etc.
