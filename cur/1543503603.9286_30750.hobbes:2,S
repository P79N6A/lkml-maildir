Hi
> o	Drop the kernel into /boot by default
I have RH on my machine, but I burned out the kernel provided by the
rpm a long time ago, so I am not familiar with the exact procedures of
the RH kernel building system, but if I understand this correctly, it
means that a newly compiled kernel gets dumped into /boot (presumably
in vmlinuz-x.y.z format?)
Does this strike anyone else as a bit of a stupid thing to do?
(Assuming I have not misunderstood, if I have, I humbly apologise to
all those with rouge headpieces).
