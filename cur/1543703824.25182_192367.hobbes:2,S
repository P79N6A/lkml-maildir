I've applied the fix part of it and pushed it out. If Andries wants to
re-send the whitespace fixes, I can apply those too, but I hate applying 
patches like this where the whitespace fixes hide the real fix.

I'd really like the ATA cdrom driver to handle different sector sizes 
properly. There really is no excuse for a block device driver to hardcode 
its blocksize if it can avoid it.
