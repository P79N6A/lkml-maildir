That's because, like x86, we've been ignoring each other.  ARM
doesn't handle dyntick SMP yet - ARM is fairly young as far as
SMP issues goes, and as yet doesn't include a full SMP
implementation in mainline.
Despite that, the timers as implemented on the hardware are not
suitable for dyntick use - attempting to use them, you lose long
term precision of the timer interrupts.

What's DYN_TICK_SKIPPING and what's it used for?  It looks like
a redundant definition left over from Tony's original implementation.
