Hi,
I have got a problem similar to the one discussed in the thread
"[BUG]linux-2.4.24 with k8 numa support panic when init scsi": When 
booting the 2.4.26 on a quad Opteron box, in most of the cases the 
kernel crashes when initializing SCSI.
It seems to me that this bug is caused by a race, as in a few
cases the machine is able to boot.
The machine always boots if I set maxcpus=1.
If I append numa=off to the command line the kernel crashes with a
"Machine Check Exception" (but is able to initialize SCSI; perhaps
this is another bug?)
Does anybody know how to solve this problem or is anybody working on it?
Can someone give me a hint where to start when debugging this race?
I will attach the config of my kernel, the syslogs and the output of
ksymoops.
Regards,
Jürgen
