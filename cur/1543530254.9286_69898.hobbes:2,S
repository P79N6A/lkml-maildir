Subject: what is a "writtable" fd in select?

I compared solaris, freebsd 3.2 and linux 2.0/2.2.
It seems when you go into select on a pipe (in this case a
named pipe), freebsd and solaris come out of select when you
can write some data to the pipe (i.e. 512-1k).   linux comes
out of the select when the pipe is empty.
I can't find a more meaningful requirement for this
(I looked on SUS V2, haven't tried the Austin group yet).
Comments on this?  Is this something tunable (I may like
the linux behavior better...)
