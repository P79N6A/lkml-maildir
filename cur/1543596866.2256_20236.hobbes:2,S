I have a strange problem, and I browsed the archives, but I don't see it 
being reported.  [God, what's the point.?  It's probably far too 
ambiguous to be useful.]
My System
HP Vectra VL8, 128 Ram, pIII 500, Matrox G200 [embedded], 2 Twelve-gig 
IDE drives.
Redhat 7.1 [Although, I don't think it matters]
I am using 'kgcc' [a.k.a. egcs-2.91.66] for compiling the kernel.
I have not located exactly [in which patch] the problem began, but if 
try to boot w/2.4.6-preX - 2.4.6,  the video goes away. And then it 
seems to lock up the computer.   At first I had APGART + DRI + MatroxFB. 
  So I removed the FB drivers, and tried again.   Same problems.   So I 
modularized Agpart, and DRI, [I need them for my X config].  No Change. 
  Almost immediatly after 'Uncompressing Linux.....'   I see a rush of 
the text across the screen, and then the screen flashes, and blinks, and 
then nothing.   I do not even have a  chance to see anything at all.  
I can't tell what's locking up, I tried a SysRQ, but got nothing.   No 
screen. *sigh*   I am not equiped to do this over a serial or parallel 
port.   I was hoping that someone would have a clue.  
In the mean time, I am expirimenting with different things. [kernel 
config's]   I will try to narrow it to a pre-release from 6.
thanks,
   Joshua
