Subject: [PATCH] compat_ioctl: fix block device compat ioctl regression
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/27/46

From: Philip Langdale <philipl@overt.org>
The conversion of handlers to compat_blkdev_ioctl accidentally
disabled handling of most ioctl numbers on block devices because
of a typo. Fix the one line to enable it all again.

Mea Culpa. This should have been found by my testing, as it's clear
that most of my big patch never worked at all. Sorry for causing
problems for everyone involved here.
I'm attributing the patch to Philip, as he's the one who pointed
out to me what the fix is.
