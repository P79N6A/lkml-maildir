Hmmm... It's possible that I've misunderstood what atomic_ops.txt actually
says.  For instance:
| 	int atomic_inc_and_test(atomic_t *v);
| 	int atomic_dec_and_test(atomic_t *v);
|

Note the last paragraph.  "It requires" should be "They require", but the
sense would seem to be obvious.  However, it's not clear on a second reading
as to whether this is an instruction to the _caller_ or an instruction to the
arch _implementer_.
I suppose from reading the abstract at the top:
| This document is intended to serve as a guide to Linux port maintainers on
| how to implement atomic counter, bitops, and spinlock interfaces properly.
that it is meant to be read by the implementor and not the user/caller, in which
case, Nick is correct.
It seems I need to adjust my memory barrier doc, and perhaps I should adjust
atomic_ops.txt too to make it clearer.
