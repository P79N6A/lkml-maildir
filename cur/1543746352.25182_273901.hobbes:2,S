I suppose the question is whether the VFS maintainer thinks that this
reiserfs private inode flag should be made visible in the i_flags, or
whether it should remain private to reiserfs and only explicitly
exported to the security modules via the new hook.  We can implement the
corresponding SELinux support for handling such private inodes either
way.  Would the VFS ever make use of the flag itself, e.g. to skip DAC
permission checking on such inodes as well?
