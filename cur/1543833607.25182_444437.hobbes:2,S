Don't bother: labelling superblocks with process-specific data is always
going to be unacceptable.
In order to avoid aliased superblocks, you would have to be able
guarantee to be the sole owner of the data on the device that it refers
to. You'd have to own the device in order to do that, in which case you
are better off just labelling the device instead.
