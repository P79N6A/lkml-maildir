Opcode 0xb0 is "WIN_SMART".
Error 0x04 is "command aborted/rejected/unsupported".
Something on your system is issuing S.M.A.R.T. commands from userspace
to the drive, and the drive either (1) doesn't support S.M.A.R.T.,
or (2) currently does not have S.M.A.R.T. enabled (smartctl -s on /dev/hda).
The "smartmontools" package is what normally issues these commands.
