There are various other subsystems which can cache substantial memory
under the right circumstances. Do you want to add all of them 
to /proc/meminfo? I'm not sure that will scale long term.
One more general possibility would be to integrate this with
with the shrinker callbacks. Everyone who caches memory should
have a shrinker. Perhaps that could be integrated with some reporting
facility that adds a dynamic counter field that is displayed
somewhere in /proc or /sys.
