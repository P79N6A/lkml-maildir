See the ext3 cvs tree at 
   
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel
[Jeff Garzik's CVS tree hosts the ext3 tree.]
Andrew Morton, being conscientious and methodical, has written lots of
filesystem testing tools during his work on ext3.  Some of these tests
are for specific ext3 regressions, but many are useful as general
integrity tests oriented toward journalled filesystems.  He has also
ported/improved several other tools, including a bunch of changes to
the notorious FSX, the File System eXerciser.
The Namesys folks also have a test suite for Reiserfs, see www.namesys.com.
