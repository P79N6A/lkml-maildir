Argh, no.  PF_NOFREEZE is inherited by the children.
So, I think that your patch is correct, but there's some suspend2-specific
stuff in it.  I've rediffed it against 2.6.23-rc6 and moved try_to_freeze()
before yield().

Commit 831441862956fffa17b9801db37e6ea1650b0f69 (Freezer: make kernel threads
nonfreezable by default) breaks freezing when attempting to resume from an
initrd, because the init (which is freezeable) spins while waiting for another
thread to run /linuxrc, but doesn't check whether it has been told to enter
the refrigerator. The original patch replaced a call to try_to_freeze() with a
call to yield(). I believe a simple reversion is wrong because
if !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP, try_to_freeze() is a noop. It should still yield.
