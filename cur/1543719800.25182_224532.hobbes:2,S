Can I read this as:
Linus himself will use strong words to enforce all recursions in the
kernel to be either removed or properly documented.
In that case, you have 273 recursions to deal with.  They are all in
the data I attached a few posts back.  Recursions would basically be
in the same league as huge stack hogs, sounds good.
