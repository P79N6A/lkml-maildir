One reason is that it makes it harder to locate the code.  I ctag each of
my architecture trees only with stuff from ./arch/that-architecture to reduce
duplicate hits.  So I end up with some x86 functions being unlocatable in
the x86 tree.  We end up with both x86_64 and x86 being broken in this
regard.
But that's a relatively minor point.  The major point is that it gives me
the creeps in hard-to-define ways ;)
