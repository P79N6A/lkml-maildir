Hi all,
I am getting the following out of fs/buffer.c immediately
after bootup.  The kernel is 2.4.11-pre2 when the message
was added.
Oct  2 17:35:08 continuum kernel: invalidate: busy buffer
Oct  2 17:35:08 continuum last message repeated 7 times
I assume this is an error though it doesn't seem to say so. 
It's consistent in that it happens on every bootup however
the repeat count can vary between 7 and 10 times.
Everything is ext2 here though LVM and MD (raid0/linear)
are both being used.
Regards,
Shane
