Basically, yes. Well not *exactly* rsync - your network drivers. I guess
rsync is showing up in process context most often because that is the
process causing most of the network activity.
Yep, it looks like fragmentation is indeed the problem here. See you have
a lot of memory that is able to be reclaimed, but the failing allocations
themselves can't reclaim any of it because they are happening from
interrupts. What they should be doing is telling `kswapd` to start freeing
memory for them - however this currently doesn't happen properly for
allocations which are order greater than 0.
Fortunately that is usually not a big problem, but as you have seen, it
can be. Anyway, expect 2.6.10 to be better (ie. good enough), and 2.6.11
should have even more complete fixes.

OK that should be fine. If you should upgrade to a 2.6.10 or later kernel,
put this value back to the default, and report further problems if they
occur.

Thanks Ralf.
