According to all the comersials, yes... I only have version 4.2,
but if memory servers correctly, there's a 4.4.1 out (and a demo
can be found at 
http://www.applix.com/appware/linux/index.htm
).
Exists for PowerPC, Alpha and i386 ... No m68k it seems though.. :(
I seriously recomend to try it out... It's only $99 US... That's
_CHEAP_ for the advanced features it sports... I love it, and use
it as main Office suit... It's a ____LOOOT___ better and faster
(and a loot more stable) than StarOffice!!!
