Thats close to what I want(restricting on pP). Restricting on pE doesn't 
work in the legacy situation ruid=0 euid=5, do an exec, then child decides
to flip the two uids and bam thats when you figure out it can't restore
the caps it should have inherited. SECURE_NO_SETUID_FIXUP still needs to
be unset for awhile.

almost always , but maybe not *always* . I have *some* support for that in
my patch already. It seemed cheap enough to do. Famous last words;->
I should release latest version to the list soon. Actually I should really
look into getting some place to host it. If I can find someone who doesn't
mind some of the controversy I seem to be generating around this issue.

When I mention capabilites I mean "soiled" capabilities not "pure draft".
Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
