We'll see.  Personally, I'm more worried about how people who don't speak 
english are supposed to choose function and variable names.  But translating 
_just_ the patch is not the end of it, and I wanted to make that clear.
I suppose a translator can always push back and ask for a _concise_ review, 
for the sake of translation.  But let's not invent problems before they 
actually occur...
