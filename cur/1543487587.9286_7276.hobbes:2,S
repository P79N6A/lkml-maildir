Make that a yes.  I have demonstrated to my satisfaction that the Solaris
TCP FIN bug very badly affects HTTP sessions (in my case going through a
Solaris 2.5.1-based firewall to get to a Linux HTTP server on which I could
conveniently turn the workaround on and off and see the results).
In HTTP, the symptom is sessions that hang forever just as they get to
100%.  I have seen this going to non-Linux sites too, but I'd recommend
using the workaround for major web servers as well as FTP servers.
I invite others to reproduce these results -- and remember that only
certain sized messages are vulnerable and it only happens if the packets
get out of order, so you won't see it on a local lightly loaded LAN.  The
client must be Solaris 2.5.1/2.6, and the server Linux 2.2.x.
