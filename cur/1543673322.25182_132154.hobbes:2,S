Just goes to show how quickly one gets used to 2.5... ;-)
Let me take a look at these.

OK, I believe the only other architecture that sets
"cant_use_aperture" is Alpha.  I asked some Alpha folks several months
ago about my patch, but never got a conclusive answer.  IIRC, on Alpha
the physical address itself determines cacheablity.  If so, we can use
PAGE_KERNEL (which is universal) instead of PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE.
Clearly the patch needs to be tested on Alpha.  The upside is that it
should let the Alpha folks get rid of a lot of ugliness in the
ioremap() code.
