How is this OK from an interface configuration view?  Yes, there are
multiple routing protocols that support CIDR, or subnet masks that are less
than the class of network itself.  But, AFAIK you can't have a subnet mask
on an >interface< that is less than the class of network.  194 is a Class C
right?  So the subnet mask must be at least 255.255.255.0 or 24 bits.  What
RFC and what section says otherwise?
