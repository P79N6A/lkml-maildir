Salut,
I've  got into  trouble with  the Linux  2.6 keyboard  layer  of Linux
2.6.0-test9* (That is, I've tested the  original as well as BK and the
mm1 and mm2 patches.) The problem is the keyboard buffer.
tty->filp.char_buf is filled correctly by my typings. The buffer state
goes  up,  and  once  I've   typed  255  characters,  of  course  it's
full. *But* the big deal  with the keyboard buffer is usually somebody
who's  reading  out  the  contents  and processing  it,  so  that  the
characters  I typed  are processed.  This is  *not* taking  place. The
buffer just fills up and there we are.
I'm of course trying to solve  that problem on my own (I remember that
last time I've  had a problem no  one even read my email),  but I'd be
glad if you'd give me some additional hints on what to do.
If I  use SysRq, the  whole thing works,  of course, as  SysRqs aren't
read from the input buffer.
(The input is  processed corectly all the way  from the keyboard (PS/2
or USB, doesn't matter, as it  works both ways.) into the buffers. The
up/down events are  handled correctly. The only thing  that's wrong is
that nobody is reading out the buffer afterwards.)
Thanks a lot for every helpful response.
