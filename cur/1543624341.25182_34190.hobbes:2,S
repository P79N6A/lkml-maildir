Just it might change immediately afterwards if you don't remove the 
object from public view first. An "atomic" value that you cannot depend
on is not very useful. The Linux convention of using atomic_dec_and_test()
is also only safe when you remove it first, but the dec_and_test encourages
this at least.  atomic_inc_and_read() could only be safe when you remove
the object first too, but I don't see how it could be ever useful assuming
you keep the convention that reference count == 0 means freeable object.

sparc32 at least. 
I think pa-risc32 too.
