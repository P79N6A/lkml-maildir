Hi
Compression is just one feature.  Each partition is wrapped in a package 
that has a header. even the kernel and boot loader are wrapped in the 
package.  Each package can be hashed and signed.  There is a patch for 
GRUB that boots CBD.  GRUB patch does 3 things, boot the kernel, find 
the latest version of each package, verify hash and signature.  This 
allow for in robust field update of packages.
