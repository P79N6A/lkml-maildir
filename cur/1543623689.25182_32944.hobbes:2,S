Thank for your attention and help on my disk io patch.  Here is the link
to the original post
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100570447604813&w=2.  I
re-submitted it a while ago against 2.4 kernels and 2.5.2 kernel.  You
can find patches related to disk io statistics at

My disk io patch sufaced a NULL pointer bug hidden in SCSI mid-layer. 
Peter Wong first reported this problem and submitted a patch which fixed
this problem scsi layer. See his patch and discussion at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101406625014323&w=2
