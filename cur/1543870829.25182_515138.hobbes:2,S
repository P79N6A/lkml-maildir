Yes it is useless.
1) There isn't really anything ethtool related implemented. Just the useless info stuff.
2) ethtool is rather useless for wireless in general (that's why there isn't
   anything implemented ;) )
Please remove the file, kill it from Makefile and remove the ethtool
ops set in main.c (one line).
