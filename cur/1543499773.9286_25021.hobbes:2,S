My opinion is that starting to put everything in the kernel is a very-very bad
idea. This thing startted with knfsd, now comes khttpd, kftpd, kraserver...
etc.. 
The more stuff will be "embedded" into the server, the more unstable will it
be. 
I think, the best solution for this problem would be to implement a clear
interface which would allow loadable modules to provide such services. Than
independent developers could make such a loadable httpd, ftpd or even in-kernel
web-browser :-)) 
but anyone using this facility has to know that he is risking his system's
stability for some speed improvement.
