This triggers me to ask about "io niceness" which has been on 
my mind for some time.
A disk intensive example is updatedb, which since the earlier 
days of linux on [34]86s, is usually reniced at 19. At that time a 
CPU did 10-50 bogomips and disks transfered  5-20MB at seek times of 
10ms or so.
Today, CPU's are 100 times as fast but disks are effectively only 
2-5 times as fast.
What I am getting at is being annoyed with updatedb ___saturating___ 
the the disk so easily as the "ancient" method of renicing does not 
consider the fact that the CPU pwrformance has increased 20-50 fold 
over disk performace.
Bottom line: what about assigning "io niceness" to processes, which
would also help with actively scheduling io toward processes 
needing it.
