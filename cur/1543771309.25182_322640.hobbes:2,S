This will be my next 2 cents.
The *natural* way to access any device is its device file in the /dev/
directory.
I've "straced" cdrecrod few times when it coundn't do scnabus properly.
What I have discovered is that cdrecord *just* tries to open several
devices that *might* be recorders. There is no need to use USB for this
to fail. For example if I had /dev/hda HDD and /dev/hdc CDR (no one
attaches both on one channel) cdrecord stopped as it faild to open hdb
while ther was no such file. Do I have to create device file if I ve got
no device?
The only thing we all ask is to make it possible to choose manually the
device node cdrecord is trying to detect. That is a 'mechanism not
polisy' thing. Let the other software insure the stabilit of naming.
Best regards.
