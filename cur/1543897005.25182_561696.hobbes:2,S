Well.  You're comparing something different.  Yes, this
thread is about linux software raid5 in the first place,
but I were commenting about [NT]CQ within a single drive.
Overall, yes, the larger your reads/writes to the drive
becomes, the faster its linear performance is.  Yet you
have to consider real workload instead of very synthetic
dd test.  It may be good approcsimation of a streaming
video workload (when you feed a large video file over
network or something like that), but even with this,
you probably want to feed several files at once (different
files to different clients), so single-threaded test
here isn't very useful.  IMHO anyway, and good for a
personal computer test.
