I'll likely poke around a bit more, but I can probably live with something 
along these lines.  My objection to exposing stuff like the HCC, ISOC, and 
ARBC registers is that my gut feel is that it would be a pain to handle 
them getting changed arbitrarily from userspace inside the driver,
especially if someone does the work to make it RSS capable.

PS: Are you still interested in changes to handle the ZT5550C versus 
    ZT5550D issues, or are things working to your satisfaction at the 
    moment?
