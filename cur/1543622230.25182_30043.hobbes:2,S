Like this:
function(...)
{
	char	*foo = 0, *bar = 0;
	int	locked = 0;
	int	rc = -1;
 
	try {
		if (bad args or something) 
			throw;
 
		locked = get_the_lock();
		foo = allocate_foo();
		bar = allocate_bar();
		more code....
		rc = 0;
	}	
	cleanup {
		if (foo) free(foo);
		if (bar) free(bar);
		if (locked) unlock();
	}  
	return rc;
}
Looks much better, IMHO.
The cleanup() block will run after the try block even if an exception 
did not occur, and will run also if the exception occured, passing the
exception to the next catch() or cleanup() block in stack.
