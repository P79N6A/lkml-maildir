The combined patch is too large (377KB) to be inlined. Reviewing it
will be made much easier if its broken down as was the case in the 
previous submission to lkml (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/29/152
)
We should be posting a readable breakdown of the next version (which 
will also incorporate feedback sent on the earlier submission) fairly 
soon and those will be inline.
