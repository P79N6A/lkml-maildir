It depends on what you want from a "general purpose" solution.  It is
general enough that you can support devices that can't be supported in
the current make-everything-look-like-a-PC framework.  And general
enough that Sun uses it for all drivers on all platforms (not that I'm
terribly happy with their implementation).  It is not general enough
to provide absolute maximum performance.
However, the cost is not as bad as you imply.  As far as I know, any
uncached memory transaction is going to have a latency of >10 cycles,
and perhaps much more, though write buffers will hide some of this.
So in most cases, the time to actually do the IO is going to dominate.
And I don't see the pipeline stall: the PII can predict and prefetch
across indirect branches, and for the simple case of a driver talking
to target(s) with just one bus primitive, the branch predictions
should be 100% accurate.

I don't know that much about I2O, but it seems like the impact of the
wrapper layer would depend on the relative amount of work that gets
done per I2O message.  If a wrapper adds a couple dozen clocks to a
message that causes the transfer of a network packet or disk sector,
then it would be much less intrusive than if the transfer time of
every byte were increased.
Anyhow, I don't think the IO abstraction layer would need to be used
for all drivers, and it probably wouldn't ever be used for something
like I2O.  I see it being used mainly in unusual situations where
specific hardware constraints (independent of performance) make it
impossible to use the native bus abstractions for certain devices.

I thought about doing something like this, but coming up with a
general coding scheme for putting the bus info in the address seems
tricky to me.  I guess I can just pretend that the device is mapped
into the normal IO space (and allocate a range of addresses as if it
is, as a placeholder), but then the macro for inb() would need to
reverse the mapping, which would be messy.
