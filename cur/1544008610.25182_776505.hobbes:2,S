Subject: [patch 087/104] jbd2: abort instead of waiting for nonexistent transaction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Duane Griffin <duaneg@dghda.com>
(cherry picked from commit 23f8b79eae8a74e42a006ffa7c456e295c7e1c0d)
The __jbd2_log_wait_for_space function sits in a loop checkpointing
transactions until there is sufficient space free in the journal.
However, if there are no transactions to be processed (e.g.  because the
free space calculation is wrong due to a corrupted filesystem) it will
never progress.
Check for space being required when no transactions are outstanding and
abort the journal instead of endlessly looping.
