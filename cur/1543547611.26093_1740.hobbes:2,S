The disk simply locks up the machine solid during boot at the point where it should report its IRQ (normally 'ide2 at 0x8890-0x8897,0x88aa on irq 7'). No Magic SysRQ or ATX-poweroff works. I have tried this under latest 2.4 kernels and on 2.2.16 with latest IDE patches (from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick
). Same result.

I tried the disk on a normal PIIX4 IDE controller where it works perfect. I tried the controller using a IBM-DPTA-373420 34 GB drive. Worked perfectly.
