   Even without that, the performance of fsck (and mount, come to that) is
   massively improved by doing a mke2fs with 4k blocks instead of 1k.
   Here are some figures I sent to linux-raid a few months ago:
Yes.  Disk has gotten so large and so cheap these days that the concern
about the last-block overhead is pretty much not an issues these days.
(Heck, even my new laptop has 6 gigs on it.  :-)
One of the things which I'm planning on doing is changing mke2fs's
defaults based on the size of the filesystem it's making.  If it's
making a large filesystem (where large is probably bigger than, say,
200-300 megs), I'll change it to use 4k block sizes and also reduce the
number of inodes created (since with a large filesystem, you generally
don't need quite so many inodes).
