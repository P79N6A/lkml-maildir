that's good!

well, it's kind of moot to demand a final solution just
to discuss the implementation ...
usually software design happens before the implementation
and the implementation details can be fed back into the
cycle later ...

although I could be totally ignorant regarding the PID
stuff, it seems to me that it pretty well reflects the
requirements for virtualization in general, while being
simple enough to check/test several solutions ...
why? simple: it reflects the way 'containers' work in
general, it has all the issues with administration and
setup, similar to 'guests' (it requires some management
and access from outside, while providing security and
isolation inside), containers could be easily built on
top of that or as an addition to the pid space structures
at the same time it's easy to test, and issues will show
up quite early, so that they can be discussed and, if
necessary, solved without rewriting an entire framework.

now that you mention it, maybe we should have a few
rounds how those 'generic' container syscalls would 
look like?
best,
