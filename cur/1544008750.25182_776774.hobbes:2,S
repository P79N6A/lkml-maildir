Applied to sparc-next-2.6, thanks.
I'm not going to add this to sparc-2.6 or stable, it doesn't
fix any real bugs on sparc (no hot plugged OF nodes, ever)
and adding it to sparc-2.6 would potentitally create some
difficult conflicts in sparc-next-2.6 since we're just finishing
a full merge of arch/sparc64 into arch/sparc there.
