Over here the your main one if not using oss emu is alsa-lib  I used
0.9.8 for most of the time, but latest 1.0_rc[12] works as well.
Also for completeness you might include the version of alsa-utils.
Then, what does lsmod give?  Also, does xmms use oss or alsa as output
driver - switching between the two may or may not improve things?
