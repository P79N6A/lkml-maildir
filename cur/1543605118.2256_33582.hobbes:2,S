That theory makes sense.  2.4.13-pre3aa1 seems more aggressive at 
making memory (swap) available to memory (swap) hogs.  2.4.12aa1
would be agressive from swpd (small) to about 130000 on this machine.
2.4.13-pre2aa1 was aggressive until swpd around 280000 on this machine, 
and 2.4.13-pre3aa1 is aggressive as long as swap is needed.
I say "aggressive" based on when mp3blaster starts to sputter.
The mp3 is on the same disk as swap and everything else.

I didn't find a user mlockall program on freshmeat or icewalkers.

I did 3 tests using "nice".  
1) nothing niced
2) mp3blaster not nice
3) mtest01 very nice, and mp3blaster not nice
mp3blaster uses about 11 seconds of CPU time to play a 3 minute mp3 on this machine.
Here is a bit of ps with mtest01 very nice, and mp3blaster un-nice

Changing nice values didn't really have any affect on mp3blaster's sound quality.

Note the total test time is around 400 seconds (wall clock * 10).
The mp3 would play just over 120 seconds by the time mtest01 completed
10 iterations.
I did a fourth run with strace -p 15645 (mp3blaster PID using most cpu time).
read(6, "\20Ks\303\303\222\236o\272\231\177\32\316\360\341\314z"..., 4096) = 4096
nanosleep({0, 200000}, NULL)            = 0     (5 calls to nanosleep)
time([1003288001])                      = 1003288001
nanosleep({0, 200000}, NULL)            = 0     (21 calls to nanosleep)
read(6, "\356$\365\274)\332\336\277c\375\356>+\234\307q\213\6\4"..., 4096) = 4096
When not running mtest01, strace is like this:
read(6, "\317W\234\311i\230\273\221\276J5\245\310A\251\226C?\202"..., 4096) = 4096
nanosleep({0, 200000}, NULL)            = 0     (4 calls to nanosleep)
time([1003287905])                      = 1003287905
nanosleep({0, 200000}, NULL)            = 0     (3 calls to nanosleep)
read(6, "$Q\17\357aL\264\301e\357S\370h{4\322L\246\344\273y\232"..., 4096) = 4096
Oddly, it appears there are more calls to nanosleep when mp3blaster is sputtering
(and fighting for i/o or memory?)
