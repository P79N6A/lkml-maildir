Hi,
You said you wanted something to  to try git on, so here you go. ;-)
The following series of patches contains some cleanups for swsusp.c.  IMO,
they are not very important, but at least the first two of them need to go
at some time.
In the order of decreasing importance:
1/4 - move the recalculation of nr_copy_pages so that the right number is used
	in enough_free_mem() and enough_swap()
2/4 - drop the unnecessary function does_collide_order()
3/4 - clean up whitespace
4/4 - make some comments and printk()s up to date
The first three patches are against 2.6.12-rc3 and they are mutually independent.
The last one is on top of the first three.
Greets,
Rafael
