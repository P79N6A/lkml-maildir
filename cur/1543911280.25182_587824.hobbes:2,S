I got it working by connecting the network card my old 100mbit hub. It
seems that the problem is only when it runs a 1gbit. So my setup is now
1gbit switch <> computers, 1mbit hub <> machine with broken netcard.
This is good enough for now, since I don't really transfer that much
data to and from the machine, but of course I would like to have 1gbit
working for when I actually do need it ;-)
