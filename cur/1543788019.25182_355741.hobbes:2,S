Let me repeat: LSI/MPT is not the norm and USB/SAS/SBP, i.e. having
an actual transport layer (handling transport tasks, and error recovery)
is the norm.
Don't make stupid bullshit generalizations that I "continue to
misunderstand basic stuff about the SCSI core".
I've probably misunderstood that LUNs are 32 bit (since SCSI Core
says so) and that REQUEST SENSE clears ACA?
I remember answering your questions on task set aborting several
years ago on linux-scsi.

Oh, I'm well aware of what you're trying to do.
But since the layers are completely upside down one compared
to the other, it would be quite messy unless you can separate
the implementations and at one or the other (but not both)
include a basic emulator.  If there is no basic emulator then
that part would have to be taken by the LLDD.
It would be messy.
