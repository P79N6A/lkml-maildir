It is. As I already mentioned in other messages, I already tested with JUST the
patched 8390.c driver, no other patches. It was stable. I then patched apic.c
AND io_apic.c, which did not introduce new instabilities. Unless you think that
reverting back to a stock io_apic.c would cause instabilities (which would be
weird, since I had no instabilities running only a patched 8390.c), I think the
patch to 8390.c DOES remove the symptoms all by itself. No other patches seem
necessary to get a stable box.
But I'll patch the mess again just fox kicks :-)
Cheers//Frank
