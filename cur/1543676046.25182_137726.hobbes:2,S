Subject: [KEXEC][2.5.70][ANNOUNCE] kexec for 2.5.70 available
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

A patch set for kexec for 2.5.70 is now available. This patch set is
based upon the stable 2.5.{67,68,69} versions of kexec. The most recent
set of kexec patches do not yet patch cleanly into 2.5.70. 
This patch was tested to work on a dual-proc P4-1.7GHz Xeon system. The
only known strangeness I have observed (YMMV) is that the VESA
framebuffer driver did not reinitialize correctly after kexec-ing a new
kernel, but the system rebooted correctly. 
The stable patches for 2.5.70 are available for download from OSDL's
patch life-cycle manager (PLM ) in pieces, or as a single unified patch.
