making symbolic link /etc/mtab -> /proc/mounts stops people from
triggering a bug in mounting loopback device (i.e. from supplying -o loop
option to mount instead of doing it properly, i.e. use losetup(8)
command). If there are other problems than this, I will switch to static
/etc/mtab. (I assume one also made a symlink /dev/root -> /dev/sdXY)
What are the other problems with /etc/mtab -> /proc/mounts?
Regards,
Tigran.
