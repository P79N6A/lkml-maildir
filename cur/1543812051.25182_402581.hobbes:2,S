Because you can't make a nameidata without a lookup, and file based 
operations don't do a lookup.  However you still have the vfsmnt and 
inode hanging off the file struct.
Either that or we make a dummy nameidata structure for this situation, 
possibly a filehandle relative lookup as used by openat() et al.

OK, so we either make it an extra parameter or 'properly' stack them 
into a single word.  Do you have any preferences either way there?
