Hi I compiled kernel 2.4.0-test5 on PowerMac 7200.  It compiled and linked
all OK.
But when I do a reboot with the new kernel, it doesn't go too far, and just
freezes.  It seems to print sort of diagnostic messages.
On the screen, it prints about 10 lines and freezes.  The last line of the
messages was
arch : exit
Any idea what this might be?
