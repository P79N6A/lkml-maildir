Not sure if this is related, but this happened twice to me as well with
pre4, both times while compiling kernels (between 5 - 15 minutes after
boot).  I don't have it in my serial console backscroll anymore,
unfortunately, but it was a "kernel BUG in ...".  I can't remember what
file it was in or line it was on, but I remember looking at it...ahh, I
see in the patch the code that looks like what I was looking at.  I think
it was this in pagemap.h:
+       if (!inode->i_nrpages++) {
+               if (!list_empty(head))
+                       BUG();
+       } else {
+               if (list_empty(head))
+                       BUG();
+       }
This starts on line 100 in include/linux/pagemap.h, and I believe it was
the first if the two "BUG()" statements there that did it (but not sure).
Nothing strange in my config -- the big/highmem stuff was set to "off",
SMP enabled, IDE disks.  I can send the whole .config if you'd like.
