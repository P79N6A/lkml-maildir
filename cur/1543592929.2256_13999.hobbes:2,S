Probably your best bet is to get the Makefile to pass a copy of the
real example source through sed to &entity;ify the bits that would
confuse SGML (<, >, etc), and into example.c.sed, make that into an
entity, and include it.
See <URL:
http://people.redhat.com/twaugh/docbook/selfdocbook/>
 for
instance, which does this with its own SGML source.
