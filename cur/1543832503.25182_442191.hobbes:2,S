Doesn't existing the the current kernel.

This info can be wrong due to udev renames.  For example tty1 vs tty/1
The info in /proc/tty/drivers describes hardware not processes, it
belongs in sysfs, not /proc.

This will be wrong because of udev renames. For example tty1 vs tty/1

Always good

This is what udev does, it maintains the mapping between devices and
names. Udevinfo is how you query the database. /etc/udev is where you
control how the device numbers are mapped into names.
Now we have a good example of the impact of pushing something (udev)
into user space and not shipping the binary as part of the kernel
tree. What is the API for converting a device node number to a name?
