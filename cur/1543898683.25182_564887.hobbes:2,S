We use this capability in XFS at the moment.
I think this is mainly for DMF (HSM) but is done via the xfs handle interface
(xfs_open_by_handle) AFAICT.
This sets up a set of invisible operations (xfs_invis_file_operations).
xfs_file_ioctl_invis goes on to set IO_INVIS which goes on to set ATTR_DMI
which is then tested in xfs_change_file_space() (which handles XFS_IOC_RESVSP & friends)
for whether xfs_ichgtime(ip, XFS_ICHGTIME_MOD | XFS_ICHGTIME_CHG)
is called or not.
