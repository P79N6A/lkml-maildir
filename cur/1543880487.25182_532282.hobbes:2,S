Subject: [PATCH -mm] workqueue: debug possible endless loop in cancel_rearming_delayed_work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
IMHO cancel_rearming_delayed_work is dangerous place:
- it assumes a work function always rearms (with no exception),
which probably isn't explained enough now (but anyway should
be checked in such loops);
- probably possible (theoretical) scenario: a few work
functions rearm themselves with very short, equal times;
before flush_workqueue ends, their timers are already
fired, so cancel_delayed_work has nothing to do.
Maybe this patch could check, if I'm not dreaming...
PS: of course the counter value below is a question of taste
