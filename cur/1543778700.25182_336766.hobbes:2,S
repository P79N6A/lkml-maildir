The most crucial thing is that all supported processors are v850e
derivatives (note the "e"), so please configure gcc/binutils for target
"v850e-elf".
[I usually use something bizarre and ancient, which appears to be a NEC
local derivative of gcc 2.9, but I've occasionally compiled the kernel
with gcc3 and it worked.]
