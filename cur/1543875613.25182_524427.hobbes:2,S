So people with z-axis mice need to redo their X config for each
kernel release when the device numbers change? Or should they
be using some other configuration?
People using this now have X crashes on kernel upgrade because
event1 became event2:
        Driver      "evdev"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/input/event1"
