I've noticed this on 2 things.  Sound and floppy (sound which I care more
about <g>)
Ok, here's what's happening (I guess you already know, but if ya don't...),
I have 256mb ram, and when I attempt to play anything, I have to swapout
anywhere from 10 to about 100mb just to get a dma buffer allocated.  My
machine at work (same problem) has 192mb ram.
Is there anyway to keep, say, a few K (~100k) of memory just for dma buffer
allocations (or it be configurable at startup or something)?  I mean, with
256mb ram, I can spare a meg or 2 for a buffer.
