I'll enable nmi_watchdog as soon as we can bring the machine down,
thanks for the excellent suggestion. I'd entirely forgotten about the
watchdog.  I'll try to switch to 2.4.33pre out as soon as poosible, it
certainly has several fixes we've been waiting for.  2.6 is still a
ways off, lots of qualification work to do.
Thanks,
Dave
