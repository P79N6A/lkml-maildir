I tried the same test, but starting closer to 4GB... here is the final lines from strace:
remap_file_pages(0xb7b55000, 2097152, PROT_NONE, 1047544, MAP_SHARED) = 0
pwrite(3, "\0", 1, 8564768768)          = 1
remap_file_pages(0xb7b55000, 2097152, PROT_NONE, 1048056, MAP_SHARED) = 0
pwrite(3, "\0", 1, 8566865920)          = 1
remap_file_pages(0xb7b55000, 2097152, PROT_NONE, 1048568, MAP_SHARED) = 0
pwrite(3, "\0", 1, 8568963072
The pwrite never returns.
So it seems to be a problem NOT with an absolute 4GB, but with a total of 4GB having been written.
Here are the first few lines from the strace to show all the options being used:
open("/mnt/bar", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_DIRECT|O_LARGEFILE, 0644) = 3
pwrite(3, "\0", 1, 4280287232)          = 1
mmap2(NULL, 2097152, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, 3, 0xff000) = 0xb7b8e000
pwrite(3, "\0", 1, 4282384384)          = 1
remap_file_pages(0xb7b8e000, 2097152, PROT_NONE, 2552, MAP_SHARED) = 0
pwrite(3, "\0", 1, 4284481536)          = 1
remap_file_pages(0xb7b8e000, 2097152, PROT_NONE, 3064, MAP_SHARED) = 0
/mnt is an nfs mount over GbE w/ jumbo frames (8160 mtu) cross-over directly to a netapp filer.
The mount options are: (from /proc/mounts)
 /mnt nfs rw,v3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,hard,intr,lock,proto=tcp,addr=x.x.x.x 0 0
The card is an Intel e1000 - default module options (NAPI-enabled)
on a 64-bit PCIX 100MHz.
Kernel is 2.6.15-rc w/ Trond's nfs patch.
Machine is a 2x Pentium 4 Xeon 2.66GHz (HT enabled), w/ 2GB ram and 4GB swap.
vmstat shows:

the sy of 25 is one virtual CPU with 100% system.
