acpi works great, for correct use I append "noapic" on the kernel boot
command line.

I'me using acpi since 2.6.0-test3 without problem, but never test with
io-apic before because, it's the first time I need an SMP kernel.
(2.6.6 kernel of Knoppix 3.4 has the same problem on my computer)

I'm not sure, but I think acpi works fine.
Thank you all for the good work with linux, keep up with it !  :)
