What is it worth? You have a few more files which you can't do anything 
with, and ifconfig output is much more greppable etc.
I remember these network devices from Solaris. There wasn't any good about 
them IIRC, the only sane way of working with them was to work around them, 
i.e. ignoring. Do you want a /dev/ignoreme directory?
We shouldn't introduce to ignore.

Thunder
