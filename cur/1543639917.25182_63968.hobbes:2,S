Helle there,
I've been, for the past days, setting up a fairly big diskless network
based on Linux. I've chosen to use 2.4.19 as the kernel because there
were some hardware requirements, and for most of the newer boxes, it
runs fine. However, for three of the older boxes, we have had some
pretty odd performance and stability issues. This message is about the
latest one, which is an ASUS P5S-B (has the infamous SIS 530 chipset)
on an intel eepro100 card. Details:
Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 530 Host (rev 2).
Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82557/8/9 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 8).
VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 6306
3D-AGP (rev a2)
We've been using NFS for the diskless boxes, of course, and for this
particular box, the CPU usage for everything is just so much higher its
amazing. It's so slow you can feel the repaints happening when running
X, even when listing directories using ls -lR. I'll show a summary of
bonnie runs on the root (NFS) partition:

Legend: hosts to the left, can is a K7-900 min and tri are K6-500s.
        v2 indicates mount options=v2
        v3 indicates mount options=v3
        v3+ indicates mount options=v3 and Trond's nfs-all patch applied
On tri, which is the referred SIS530 box, as you can see, for most runs
the CPU usage is just so much higher than minas, which has practically
the same setup: K6-500, old PCI (no AGP) board, eepro100 card. I'm
wondering if anybody has seen something like this before?
The server is a K7 with 2 3c905-TXM cards that is serving all other
boxes with no problems reported (beyond some lockd quirks I'm trying to
get my head around).
I've tried applying Trond's patches, using pci=biosirq and other tweaks,
but nothing has really made it better. Any idea what's going on?
Crossposting to reach the appropriate parties as I feel its quite a
cross-subject issue.
Take care,
