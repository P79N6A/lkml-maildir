I'm stunning we are even having this argument. You are talking about
what appes to be a hardware destruction enabling security level bug in
the 2.6 kernel and arguing about whether it is a feature or not.
In essence you are saying read access to any raw device node entitles
the opener of the file to destroy the attached device (device even not
just media). You are arguing that its ok that I can use raw scsi I/O to
subvert the read/write permissions too.
In the example code I gave

means there is no need to recompile anything, you just need priviledges
to do stuff the kernel doesn't *know* is safe. This is the correct
behaviour for people who don't live in cloud cuckoo land.
