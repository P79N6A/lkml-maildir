From a pure clock point of view. For some reallife performance rather look
at the SPEC numbers. Actually I don't care about the clocking of a processor
especially when vendors are pushing it with longer pipelines as this is
all marketing crap (and let's see what problems Intel will face with the
Centrino architecture to tell that lower clocks might bring higher performance
with a different design).
BTW: Distributed.net client has now an AltiVec implementation which makes an
G4/500 eat an Athlon/1.8GHz for breakfast...
