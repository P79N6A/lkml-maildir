wrong. 
It's "special" only a little bit when the kernel invokes it, but not
really. The *application* is what decides to use which file. And for
example LSB application use another ld.so than the normal one.
(So that the LSB ld.so can translate from the LSB abi to what is on the
system).
But when invoked manually.. there is even LESS special about it... it
could be ANY file on the system. And it's no different from any other
file in /bin, /usr/bin etc etc

denying PROT_EXEC of non-"x" files does (somewhat). It's never fool
proof obviously, as long as you need to allow jits.

this is just entirely a wrong assumption; one based on the assumption
that ld.so is something special, that it isn't.
