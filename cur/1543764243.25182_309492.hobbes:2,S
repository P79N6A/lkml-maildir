Yeah, that's a risk.  But gratuitous trailing whitespace changes shouldn't
cause a lot of downstream problems due to `patch -l'.
What I do is to ensure that we never _add_ trailing whitespace.  So
anything which matches
	^+.*[tab or space]$
gets trimmed.  My theory is that after 10 years of this, all the trailing
whitespace will be gone.  Problem is, I also see the hundreds of lines of
code in the bk patches which add trailing whitespace :(
Larry sent me a little bk script which would spam the user if they tried to
commit something which adds trailing whitespace, but maybe that's a bit
academic right now.
