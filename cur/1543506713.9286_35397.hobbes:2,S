So there's no problem firing up like 4000 threads (I know it's bad
programming style, but I need to port the original code fast) on a 2.3.1[x]
kernel?
Is that true for 2.2.11+ also?
Are there any numbers or limits I should know of, or is it like win32, you
can alloc as many threads you wan't but it will become sluggish (as hell)
after a certain number...
Thanks for the quick reply :)
