Hi,
can anyone update me on the status of this combination? I am using
2.1.131ac10 at the moment, and a step to 2.2.1(ac2) wouldn't be too bad
because it seems there is a better 2048-byte per sector support (my MO drive
could use that, I had a couple problems with mke2fs).
I don't want to be rid of ISDN, though ... I don't need the "disable
dial-on-demand" feature that 2.0.36 has, but I _need_ ISDN support.
So: should I upgrade? :)
PS: anyone actively using md devices with 2.2.x kernels here?
