I consistently get an Oops when attempting to install either of these on
my A7V133/Athlon 1.4GHz. It happens every time the install attempts to
create ext2 or ext3 file systems on the IDE drive. I boot with  nodma
option for both ide0 and ide1.
I've heard of threads relating to this before, but I thought I'd send
this e-mail for clarification. I'm wondering if I have a bad MoBo, as
I've also had problems running fsck on a Ultra 160 SCSI drive that has
RH 6.2 installed on it using the same system.
