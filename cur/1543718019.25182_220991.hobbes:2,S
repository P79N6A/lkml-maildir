Bart, could something like:
if (system_state == SYSTEM_RESTART) {
	ide_cache_flush_p(drive)
	return;
}
(as opposed to just the return in that patch and -mm3) possibly help? I 
sort of expect that ide_cache_flush_p() is already called further on up?
Alan, if you know, that drive fails ide_id_has_flush_cache()?
Note, very aware I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here (and equally 
aware I don't _want_ to be here :-) Having the drive spin down on each 
reboot is totally unacceptable though. Not only does spinning up again 
take significant time and noise, it's also actively bad for the drive.
If there's no sane way to fix this, an explicit blacklist for drives 
that really need to be shutdown? Eew.
Rene.
