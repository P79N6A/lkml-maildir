I tried it. No success.
dmesg: after the "bad" program I wrote some mail ago.
__alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x1d2/0) from c0123cc1
VM: killing process a.out
I forgot to mention:
c0123c60 t page_cache_read
c0123d10 t read_cluster_nonblocking
If you need  a backtrace, we should insert a panic into the code to get a 
full back trace for the debugging.
greetings
