I have an nForce2 w/ Radeon 9000.  No problems w/ DRI drivers (included
in kernel) or thi ATI supplied drivers, which ATI says successfully
compiled against 2.6.0-test6.

Make sure you have all the different module options turned on.  In 2.6
there are different options for loading, unloading and force unloading
modules.

I don't know anything about video input.  Did you try Google?

I don't know anything about telephony.  Did you try Google?

What CPU/chipset do you have?  There are timing issues with nForce2
and AMD CPUs.  A quick search of the LKML archives will yield lots
of discussion and patcheson this issue.

VMWare won't work (according to the VMWare tech support people), but
they will (probably) support 2.6 kernels in their next point release.
I assume you are talking about their workstation product.  SWSusp
works fine on my laptop.

But there is plenty of improvement for plenty of people.

I doubt I have the same hardware as the main developers, but I did
read the documentation.  Did you?  Even if it is stable enough for
most people, it is still a beta kernel.
