First, I think it is critical that we allow processes to run outside of
any container (unless we know for sure that the penalty of running a
process inside a container is very very minimal).
And anything running outside a container should be limited by default
Linux settings.

                           ^^^^^ This will force the "default" container
with limits (indirectly). IMO, the whole guarantee feature gets defeated
the moment you bring in this fuzziness.

It seems that a single notion of limit should suffice, and that limit
should more be treated as something beyond which that resource
consumption in the container will be throttled/not_allowed.
