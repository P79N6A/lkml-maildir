I've reenabled highmem(4g).
Seems to be working fine.  Has been running 11 minutes, without problems.
ps: Something that irks me.  During bootup, I get the high-latency traces for
    swapper/0.  These fill up the dmesg ring buffer, so the early messages get
    dropped.  Is there anything that can be done to fix that?
