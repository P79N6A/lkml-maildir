Both HFS and QNXFS has been in the kernel for quite some time, yet both
are flagged Experimental.
Is this still the case? Are they considered more unstable than other
filesystems in the kernel? If they are considered unstable, HFS should
be made if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" ] ...
I've CC'd this mail to the maintainers/creators of these filesystems.
