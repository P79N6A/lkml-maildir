You can't restrict the GPL.

How is that different from Logical Block Numbers with a fixed cluster
factor? (besides it wastes more bits)

Hopefully  optional.

IT-Security is about availability and reliability also.

How should  WE know? (For mount you might want to have versioning and uuids)

Think about optimizations like NTFS, where you can sort directories by
attributes and store often used attribtes in the dir, so you dont need a
inode dereference (MFT lookup in case of ntfs)

Dont forget to optimize  directories for all  4: insertion/deletion/lookup
and traversal.

Do you want to run old style NNTP Servers?

In fact I miss a bit a new idea, so what makes your FS better, why should
anyone use a non-open source implementation if it does not provide anything
new?
