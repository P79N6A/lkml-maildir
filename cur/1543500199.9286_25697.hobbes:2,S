Hi there.

Perhaps the following patch will help. It defines a kassert() macro
that reports the location where an assertion fails via printk with the
KERN_DEBUG reporting level, and should apply cleanly against ANY Linux
kernel release.
To enable it, define DEBUG before including it; to disable it, don't.
All that's required is for the relevant unit authors to add the
relevant calls to their units.
