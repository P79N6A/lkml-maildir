well... to be honest the more obvious problem will be that you won't be testing the RAM, you'll be testing the CPU's cache.. over and over again.
memtest86+ does various magic to basically bypass the caches (by disabling them ;-)...
Doing that in a live kernel situation, and from userspace to boot...... that's... and issue.
