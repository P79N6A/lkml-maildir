Actually that place simply was where I found how the
.: 188: .tmpver.eC4856.1: not found
dash error that happened when I replaced the bash-specific "source"
statement with its "." counterpart could be ""fixed"".

So this part seems to indicate that merely prepending ./ is problematic,
since ./ implies relative path resolution whereas $TMPFILE.1 could
theoretically be an absolute path already.
It would probably be best to add the ./ to mktemp already, to make sure
we source *exactly* the filename expression we originally mktemp'd.
OTOH prepending ./ to mktemp by default would deny mktemp any
"search for a temporary-capable directory and create the file there"
capabilities. Hmm. I should investigate POSIX shell sourcing
mechanisms more.

The variable manipulation seems bash-specific, the resulting dash error was:
linux-2.6.23/scripts/patch-kernel: 205: Syntax error: Bad substitution
which pointed at the
	if [ ${EXTRAVERSION:0:1} == "." ]; then
line.

They weren't strictly needed, what was needed was to add the missing $ sign
(you could perhaps say that I added the spaces to emphasize the $ sign).
Maybe they're best removed.

No. I should have started by looking at the opengroup.org site when
looking for POSIX specs...

I got 
linux-2.6.23/scripts/patch-kernel: 270: arith: syntax error: "SUBLEVEL"
thus I simply removed braces since that "fixed" the issue.
May be incorrect, though...
I'll think a bit more about these couple changed places (and whether
this still truly works as intended) and mail a patch then.
(and a big NOTE: I'm no POSIX vs. non-POSIX shell guru at all, only a
semi-versed shell script writer, thus these changes should be reviewed
quite thoroughly)
Thanks for your very fast review,
Andreas Mohr
