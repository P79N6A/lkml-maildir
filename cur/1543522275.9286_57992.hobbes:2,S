ORBS is also blocking mail relay from portions of the PacBell domain, so I 
was finding mail bouncing using that system.  Rather than try to get the 
giant monolith to fix its act (you would have been floored by the mail I 
received from Technical Support when I reported the ORBS block!) I decided 
to crank up sendmail and run my own SMTP relay.
A side effect of doing this is that my mail gets through *much* faster, and 
much more reliably.  I also have a log of all my mail activity, which I 
didn't have with the ISP-based mail provider.
This is a send-only SMTP server -- it does not accept incoming traffic from 
anyone outside of the local network.
