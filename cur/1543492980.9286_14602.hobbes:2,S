Hmmm, looks like you are already playing with the UID.

OK, this has to be ext2. That sucks. You don't have a good backup either.

Why run a shell? The exploit code could transfer an executable and
set any special bits needed. You can not rely on an exec() to drop
bits, since the exec() is not needed.
In case named is unable to set those bits, the exploit code could
just transfer an object file and do a dlopen() on it. Even without
any filesystem access at all, you could bootstrap a huge executable
through a tiny buffer overflow. No exec() ever happens.

I reject true setuid root, but not use of the setuid root bit.
Headers may be mangled to prevent execution on old kernels.
If something is dangerous, it ought to look dangerous.
Emacs may already be sticky and immutable.

The specification isn't a Standard, so that would be reasonable.

One could have a mount option like this:
      trusted=rootowned,sticky,immutable
By default, setuid-root executables are trusted unless mounting with
setuid executables disabled.
Option list:
rootowned    owned by root
setuidroot   setuid to root
sticky       sticky bit set
immutable    immutable bit set
system       system bit set
pgp          has a valid signature
...          ...
One could also add specific trusted executables in the VMS manner.
