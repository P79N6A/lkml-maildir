mmm. added complexity and interface clutter for little or no benefit
is what I'm trying to avoid - they did that in the IBM bugzilla and
it turned into a big ugly unusable monster. You can call me either
"experienced" or "bitter" depending what mood you're in ;-)
Not sure I'd agree that most of the bug submitters are all that
professional, it's a very mixed bag.

That should work now ... seems to for me.

Produces a metric-buttload of results. Go to the advanced search option
and do "A Comment" contains the string "VIA". By default "Status" is
only set to do open bugs, which you might want to change to all types.

Would be good, thanks. I tend to favour keeping things as simple as
possible though, we have very little control over our users, and they're
a very broad base. Making the barrier to entry for use as low as
possible is the design we've been pursuing.
