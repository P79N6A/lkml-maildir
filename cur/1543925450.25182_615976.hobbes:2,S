Great thanks for all this! I went through all of them,
put some comments in, ran tests and incorporated them
(nearly completely and unchanged).
They really catched a great number of issues.
I also added you to the header of the complete patch
(also with your Signed-off-by), is that ok?
After some final tests are through i'll repost the complete patch in
the review thread and in CC to Greg again.
