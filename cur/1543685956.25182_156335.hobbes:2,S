I can confirm this problem.  It happens on one of my newsservers as well,
currently at least once per day.  It is a dual PIII 650MHz, 1GB RAM,
200GB spool (scsi hardware raid array attached to adaptec aic7xxx), six
seperate SCSI disks attached to a seperate aic7xxx controller for
overview, running inn-2.3.2.
We've tried  RedHat kernels 2.4.18-3, 2.4.18-17.7, 2.4.20-19.7 and 
2.4.20-19.7bigmem as well as a kernel.org 2.4.20 - all with the same 
problem.
After the filemap.c / pmd_ERROR() printk, the box either hangs (no 
further printout, not that often) or has a stack overflow (most of the 
time):
filemap.c:2258: bad pmd c0003000(00000000000001e3).
do_IRQ: stack overflow: -864

The messages are always preceded by a '(scsi0:A:0:0): Locking max tag 
count at 64' message. The scsi device number is changing, so it cannot 
be a single device

Unfortunately I'm not very familiar with the linux MM subsystem.  But 
since I consider this now as a confirmed bug, maybe some of the other 
lkml folks have an idea what might be going on.

We don't use lvm, so the similarities seem to be:  Dual PIII, 
SCSI, INN
