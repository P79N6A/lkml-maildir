AFAIK only one driver (VIA unichrome) has had this problem recently. 
Thomas Hellstrom fixed it, so I added him to the cc: list.  Thomas, you
mentioned there was a performance hit associated with the fix; would
this be an improvement over what you did?
Also I should add that I was quoting a research.microsoft.com whitepaper
above.  But s/AccelStar II AGP/VIA CLE266/ and it applies exactly to my
results.  Just want to give credit where it's due...
