Hi Alan and folks,

gcc 2.95.2, I/O subsystem is PIIX4 IDE here. No problems with "pure" reading 
and writing however, so it really seems to be connected to something special 
done by patch. Build was fresh from a clean tree.

Perhaps - but strange both are only triggered by "patch"? Or maybe the 
reiserfs errors are later consequences of the same problem.

Will try this now, sounds possible - but does patch really use shared memory?
I will try to narrow it down a bit. There also were some changes to 
mm/memory.c between 2.4.18-rc2-ac2 and 2.4.18-ac1. Also a possibility?

Have bios enabled in all kernels, will try without. But there were no PNPBIOS 
changes between the working 2.4.18-rc2-ac2 and the failing 2.4.18-ac1, so
I would rule this out.

Not using sd driver or ps2 at all.

Use nothing at all of them, just compiled most things as modules, which are 
not loaded.
