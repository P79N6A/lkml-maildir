   Yes, and in principle it would be possible to make the sendfile
   completely asynchronous, essentially by doing the disk IO asynchronously
   from a dedicated kernel thread.
The other way of doing this is with callbacks; simply register the async
sendfile function with an IO completion hook, and keep all of the state
for the async sendmail in a structure.  Then you can handle the async
sendmail processing in a bottom half task, without having to dedicate a
whole kernel thread to it.
