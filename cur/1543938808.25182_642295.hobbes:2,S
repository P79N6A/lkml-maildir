The current code sets a bunch of vma flags (VM_RESERVED, VM_DONTCOPY,
VM_FOREIGN) so the VM doesn't try to handle those special mapping.  IIRC
one of them was needed to not make rmap unhappy.

Would not work.  Need to pass a pointer to the pte so the xen hypervisor
can do unmap (aka pte_clear) and grant release as atomic operation.
Thus passing the value of the pte entry isn't good enougth.
Another maybe workable approach for Xen is to go through pv_ops
(although pte_clear doesn't go through pv_ops right now, so this would
be an additional hook too ...).
