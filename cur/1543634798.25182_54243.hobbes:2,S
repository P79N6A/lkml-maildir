Did you look at sender or changed both of the functions?
After that accident TCP was changed and it does not use copy_from_user more,
it does copy_and_csum even when no checksum is required. So, his results
on sender side (except for strange anomaly at msg size 8K) just confirm
nil effect of copy_from_user.
What's about copy_to_user, we forgot about this at all,
worrying mostly about sender side. :-)
