It's not that its invalid, it just doesn't make much sense.  It points to
whatever task happened to be running when the interrupt happened.  So
any attempt to access it is 99% likely to be a bug.

Yes, on architectures that use current->processor that is an exception
to the rule.  After all, you know for sure that you're still on the
same CPU as the task currently running.
