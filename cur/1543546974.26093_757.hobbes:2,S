Okay. So you do know how it works. Some newbies look at the kernel code
and say; "Ahh this is written in 'C'. I know how to do this.....". The
next thing you know is that are trying to put databases in the kernel.

Don't use the big kernel lock. Put spin-locks around anything that
could possibly change, destroying the logic of your code. Do not do any
I/O to any user-context while holding a lock (needs to page-fault).
