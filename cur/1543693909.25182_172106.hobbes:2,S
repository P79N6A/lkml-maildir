I was going to just not bother about this wart.  After all, we get to write
the standard on remap_file_pages(), and we can say "the
truncate-causes-SIGBUS thing doesn't work".  After all, it is not very
useful.
But I wonder if this effect could be used maliciously.  Say, user A has
read-only access to user B's file, and uses that access to set up a
nonlinear mapping thereby causing user B's truncate to not behave
correctly.  But this example is OK, isn't it?  User A will just receive an
anonymous page for his troubles.
Can you think of any stability or security scenario which says that we
_should_ implement the conventional truncate behaviour?
