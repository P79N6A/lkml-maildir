2.4.6-pre3 and earlier.  fs/namei.c:lookup_flags() checks for O_CREATE,
it even has a comment saying that O_CREATE|O_EXCL is a special case.
But the only place lookup_flags() is called has
if (!(flag & O_CREAT)) {
	if (path_init(pathname, lookup_flags(flag), nd))
so O_CREATE can never be set.  Not a bug, just misleading.  It does not
help that path_walk() has a variable called lookup_flags.
