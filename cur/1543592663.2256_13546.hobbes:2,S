Subject: Kernel 2.2: tq_scheduler functions scheduling and waiting

All:
I have been diagnosing kernel panics for over a week and I have
concerns with the use of tq_scheduler for which I was hoping I
could get some assistance.
Is it considered acceptable for functions in the tq_scheduler
task list to call schedule?  Is it acceptable for such functions
to wait on wait queues?  What limitations exist?
As near as I can determine, the TTY driver code makes use of
the tq_scheduler list for such purposes.
In my testing, I am running with 96 TTY devices (talking to a
high-density modem card) and I consistently achieve kernel panics
when the system is under heavy swapping.  I am continuing to
diagnose the problem.  The kernel panics are triggered mostly in
goodness() and del_from_runqueue(), as indicated by ksym_oops and
gdb, and I suspect the run queue is getting corrupted.
In spite of this testing, I believe that I have an argument against
tq_scheduler functions waiting on wait queues, but I have not
thoroughly convinced myself that (a) this was not already known,
and (b) this is already happening in existing kernel code.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

     appreciate references to this material.  All of my searches to
     date have yielded few results and nothing definitive.
