FWIW, I've seen strange but hard-to-reproduce behavior with the PCMCIA
stuff in test6-pre6 and test6-pre9 on my laptop (Sony VAIO 505TX).  I'm
primarily using the wavelan_cs module, which may have something to do
with the problems (wavelan_cs seems to behave more poorly than the other
network drivers I've used on this laptop).  Here are the things I've
seen:
* wavelan_cs sometimes doesn't get unloaded when the card is removed
* after some time, the card services seem to get wedged, and don't find
any cards when I insert or remove them.  (restarting cardmgr doesn't
help)
* I got an OOPS while doing "insmod wavelan_cs" at one point.  I forgot
to save the current ksyms, though, so I couldn't get anything
interesting from it.
I hadn't bothered to send a note to LKML up to this point, b/c I haven't
been able to consistently reproduce any of these problems.  Given that
others are having problems as well, though, perhaps these additional
clues will be meaningful to someone.  I'll send a followup note if I
find any additional information (or if the problems seem to go away with
test6, which I haven't tried yet....)
Best,
