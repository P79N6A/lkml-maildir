This patch does not apply cleanly to linux-mips Git tree:
----> snip
patching file arch/x86/kernel/Makefile
Hunk #1 FAILED at 69.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file arch/x86/kernel/Makefile.rej
----> snip
I believe this is because the linux-mips tree and the -mm tree are not in sync.

It seems tempting to include at least Alpha in this patch, because they
have a device initcall identical to the one, which you're removing from
the MIPS and x86 arch code.
