Hi,
In the following two replies to this message there are two versions of
the same fix, one of which applies to 2.6.16-rc3 and the second to the recent
-mm.
The fix is needed to restore the compatibility with the older code that
allowed to suspend even if the kernel command line didn't contain the
"resume=" argument.  This feature is necessary so that swsusp can work
in the default Fedora setup where the swap partition is on an LVM.
I consider the first patch, against 2.6.16-rc3, as an urgent fix that should
go in 2.6.16, if possible.  It has been tested by Dave and evidently fixes the
Fedora issue.  Unfortunately it doesn't apply to the recent -mm, because
in -mm the code in question is split between mm/swapfile.c and
kernel/power/swap.c, so the other patch is needed.
Please apply.
Greetings,
Rafael
