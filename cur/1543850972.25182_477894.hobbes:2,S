Yes. I am not exactly sure if it's something in jiffies calibration 
(because of the 'WP bit/supervisor' thing too), so maybe I thought it 
was the newly-introduced SMP alternatives. I gotta check that.

Booting with 'time' shows that the virtual time increases as usual, i.e.
[ 9.00] checking if wp bit...
