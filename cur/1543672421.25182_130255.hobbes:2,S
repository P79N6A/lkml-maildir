Subject: 2.4.20: scheduler issue: bad scheduling latency case

Hi,
I have found a case which may introduce bad scheduling latency up to
10 msec (or 1/HZ sec) in task scheduler of kernel 2.4.20 at SMP machine.
In schedule(), if other CPU in the system set "need_resched" flag
of task struct within the section showed below in order to request 
rescheduling, this reschedule request can be neglected.
		case TASK_RUNNING:;
	}
*****	prev->need_resched = 0;  ***************   // begin section 
	/*
	 * this is the scheduler proper:
	 */
(Omission)
	/*
	 * from this point on nothing can prevent us from
	 * switching to the next task, save this fact in
	 * sched_data.
	 */
*****	sched_data->curr = next;   *************  // end section
	task_set_cpu(next, this_cpu);
This case seems to be very rare, but it was observed that this occurred 
several times while I compiled a Linux kernel in my environment (machine 
with 2 logical CPUs by Hyper-Threading enabled processor). 
A simple patch for this issue is attached.
Does it make sense?
