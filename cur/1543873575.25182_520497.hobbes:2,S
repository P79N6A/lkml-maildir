I don't think struct ff_envelope is a good candidate: Spring effects
don't have any envelope.
We have plenty of space for new effect types. Why not add a bunch of
new types, and add more structs in the ff_effect union?
The other option where you somehow manage to specify planes and
combine several effects is a good solution for devices where the
driver is responsible for storing effects, but it's wasteful for
I-Force-like devices where the effects are stored on the device. You
would be using two (or more) effects in the device's memory where only
one would be used if you used all the potential of the device. That
is, unless the driver is smart enough to merge effects, but that seems
hard.
