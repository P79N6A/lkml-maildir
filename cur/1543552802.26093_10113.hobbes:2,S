However all software is *not* written to use LFS extended versions
of things.  Often using defines of:
        -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
in the Makefile of said software CFLAGS is enough, but that may
still sometimes not be enough.  Specifically if the system will
then use some libraries which are not LFS compatible.
