On IRC he ACKed makeing it a bool.

We also need to make b_size an 32 bit quantity, otherwise 64k buffers
on architectures like ia64 will get us horrible overflows.  And yes,
people use that big pages - Nathan just added an ugly workaround to XFS,
for splitting 64k pages into multiple bh, because of that exactly that
limitation.

As the patch is already large enough I'd be happy if Marcelo applies the
current patch, once it's in I'll move the indicator to b_flags, okay?
