Either you use devfs, or you don't.  Why even support such
an odd case?  Those wanting devfs makes the transition once.

I use devfs and likes it.  Perhaps the current _implementation_ is bad,
the _idea_ is certainly good.  Seeing only devices I actually have
is so much better than seeing all devices I possibly could
connect.  And it is updated automatically whenever something
is added to or removed from the machine.
A cleaner smaller devfs increase the chance of better
maintenance.
I also like having subdirectories instead of a flat /dev, but
that is of course doable with the old way too.
