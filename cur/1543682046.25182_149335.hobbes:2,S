Thanks for your explanation.
The language of the SuSv3[1] seems a little vague:
  If there is a previous alarm() request with time remaining, alarm()
  shall return a non-zero value that is the number of seconds until the
  previous request would have generated a SIGALRM signal.
It leaves open to interpretation the question of what the return value
should be if the delta between calling alarm(1) and alarm(n) is near 0s,
about .5s, and near 1s.  I think the issue can be boiled down to an
implementation choice of floor(delta), round(delta), ceil(delta).
Linux 2.4, Solaris, OpenBSD take the floor() approach.  Running
alarm2.c[2] on them gives results similar to the following; where
'delta' is the difference in microseconds between calling alarm(1) and
alarm(2), and 'ret' is the return value of the alarm(2) call:
t1      t2      delta   ret
------  ------  ------  ------
940284  947913  7629    1
948336  57230   108894  1
57697   266358  208661  1
266826  576979  310153  1
577455  986953  409498  1
987447  497109  509662  1
497576  106690  609114  1
107173  817304  710131  1
817767  626956  809189  1
Alarm clock
That is, even when 809ms have passed between calling alarm(1) and
alarm(2), Linux 2.4/Solaris/OpenBSD report that there is 1s "until the
previous request would have generated a SIGALRM signal."
Since 2.5 is incrementing tv_sec if any tv_usec remain, it is much
closer to taking a ceil() approach: 1.000847848 gets converted to 2,
rather than 1.
I guess the question boils down to: does Linux 2.6 want to make a
different implementation choice than 2.4 and other Unix variants?
