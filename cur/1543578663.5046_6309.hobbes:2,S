It's a bit dangerous: _if_ one of the function is called with disabled
local interrupts, then spin_unlock_irq would enable these interrupts.
That could cause other problems, but I haven't checked if these function
are actually called with disabled interrupts - e.g. the transmit
function is called with enabled interrupts.
Frank, the 2.4.0 contains 2 band aids that were added for ne2k smp:
* From Ingo: focus cpu disabled, in arch/i386/kernel/apic.c
* From myself: TARGET_CPU = cpu_online_mask, was 0xFF.
Could you disable both bandaids? I disabled them, no problems so far.
Now back to the disable_irq_nosync().
