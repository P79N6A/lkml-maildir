I completely agree, a bad example is worse than no example.  Plus, an
opportunity to have you and hpa hacking on lguest is not to be missed.

Hmm, I railed for so long against Xen doing that, it feels... wrong...
to do that now 8)
I think I'll need to hack in a magic signature before the lguest start:
it's the only way it'll work with unpacking bzImages as well.  And it'll
be trivial to rip out later when we have the Right Way.
I'll spin a patch this afternoon (got to go to puppy training now).
Thanks!
Rusty.
