I'm no x86 expert, but I have the impression that
current_cpu_data.loops_per_jiffy will be invalid (probably 0) until
smp_store_cpu_info() is called in smp_callin().  If so, a console
driver using udelay() might not work properly.  I suspect there are
other issues, but this is just based on looking at the x86 source code
for 5 minutes.
