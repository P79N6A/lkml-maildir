If I try to route more than 40mbps (40% line utilization) through a 100mbps
port (tulip) on a 2.4.0-test kernel running on a pIII 500 (or higher)
system, not only does the performance drop to nearly 0, the system gets all
sluggish and unusable.  This is with or without Jamal's FF patches.
How are you managing to get such high throughput?
Jon
