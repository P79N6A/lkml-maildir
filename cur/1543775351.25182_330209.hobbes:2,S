I see it as a heavier incentive to do it by a framework that's in
the kernel.

If I want to access metadata with bash, do I patch bash to support
both Gnome's and KDE's solutions? Was there one of XFCE too?
And FooBarXyzzyWM that'll want to do it's own VFS next year?
I'd also guess that the upstream guys would much rather have
patches for their progs that conform to the kernel than some
obscure neighbor userspace system.
Sure looks like having this in the kernel makes it easiest; there's
just one common denominator to patch for.
This doesn't even invalidate the userland VFSs of the other guys,
they're still needed for systems whose kernels don't have a
metadata facility.
