Right. The current reroute code assumes that all interrupts use masking.
If you think about migrating the reroute code to new per-line (or
per-device) masking/threading: this means we need to hook into
request_irq() or some such, to find out if an interrupt handler requests
a masked/threaded IRQ.
The state of the mask bit in the IO-APIC RDL is not sufficient. It is
switched on in the initial IRQ handler and switched off when the IRQ has
been handled by the IRQ thread. A cleared mask bit does not mean that
the IRQ-line will not be masked.

IRQ sharing mainly has an effect on latency. I do not expect the latency
changes to be large, so this is not an issue for non-RT computing. But
for RT computing increased latency is an issue. So why would we increase
the latency for RT computing with our reroute code? Because it is the
only approach that reliably targets and fixes the problems caused by
broken hardware for RT. The only alternative to that is to use different
hardware.
Making the widely available broken hardware work at the cost of a bit of
added latency seems to be a good tradeoff (and the best tradeoff
available, as far as we know).
We have not seen any newer bridges that are broken, so we expect that
eventually the need for rerouting will go away. But this is probably
years in the future, when the broken hardware is not being used anymore.
We were preparing a paper which describes the problem and all the
approaches we considered and/or tried. We also have a presentation about
this. Unfortunately, due to the huge number of other interesting
presentations, we could not give our presentation at the LPC and the
paper was not finished. But we have a simplified version of the paper
and are working on making it and the presentation slides available
online.

Threaded IRQ handling masks the IRQ while the original IRQ is still
pending. This is done so that IRQs in general can be activated quickly
again (by leaving the initial IRQ handler) in order to minimize the
times where other, high-priority threads cannot run.
The masking then prevents the pending IRQ from re-activating the IRQ
handler. Later the IRQ thread will handle the IRQ and unmask the line.

Yes. To prevent this, the patent by Intel describes a bit that disables
boot interrupts. But this bit has not been implemented in several Intel
chips.

Yes, I agree: if I was a BIOS manufacturer and had to write the ACPI
tables for boot interrupts, I would not see a way to describe this
behaviour in the ACPI tables either.

Yes, preventing boot interrupts by completely disallowing masking in
software is not a solution either: masking is needed for threaded
interrupt handling and for disabling (!) interrupt lines (although this
also does not work as expected on broken chips, as the IRQ will then be
delivered via the boot interrupt mechanism -- in the case of screaming
IRQs this leads to a situation where both lines are disabled).

And this will happen every time. And as you (Stefan) reminded me, the
second of the two invocations of the ISR may not see the IRQ asserted on
the device anymore (e.g. if the boot interrupt line was masked, and if
it is unmasked after the threaded IRQ handler de-asserted the IRQ on the
device). So we may end up having screaming IRQs on one IRQ line, leading
to the nasty effects again that we needed to avoid. This failure mode is
also very difficult to reproduce and analyze.

Yes, we should better integrate this information and keep the
information in the ACPI tables available.
My suggestion is to add a "used_irq" field to acpi_prt_entry. If that
field is valid (i.e. not -1), we use that IRQ number instead of the one
reported in the ACPI table.
