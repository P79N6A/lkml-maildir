That case shouldn't be a problem, since when your device get discovered,
hopefully, the host controller is already there. Though in some cases,
host controllers just appear as a sibling device, and in this specific
case, it may be not have been "discovered" yet.
There can be other bad dependencies between "sibling" devices (especially
functions of the same physical devices), which is why I would make sure
that all devices on a given level have been probed (that is their
pci_dev structure created) before the various drivers get notified.
Ben.
