It doesn't get built on sparc64 any more.
If you look at the current tree:
1) we handle all of the sparc64 RTC stuff in arch/sparc64/kernel/time
2) all the __sparc_v9__ crap is removed from drivers/char/rtc.c
3) all the __sparc__ crap is changed to CONFIG_SPARC32 in same
4) CONFIG_RTC is not longer allows on sparc64, only sparc32 with PCI
