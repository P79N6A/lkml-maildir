Hi,
Since 2.4.4 the kernel says
PCI: Using IRQ router VIA [1106/0686] at 00:07.0
Applying VIA PCI latency patch.
on bootup. Is this the workaround for the 686B problems? I have a 686A board 
which should, in theory, be not affected by the bug. So why is this setting 
still applied? If it's something different, never mind.
Bye
Oliver
