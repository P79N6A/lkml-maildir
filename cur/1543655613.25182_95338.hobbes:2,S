With out going into a lot of detail, since I don't think I
need such an animal, one would need to keep the actual id
somewhere (either the node or in what it pointed to).
Perhaps a less costly way would be to keep a sequence
number, say the number of items allocated so far and
inserting that.  I think one would want to make sure this is
not a power of 2, but this may not be needed as the first
freeing would generate an indexing of the number WRT to the
id.
