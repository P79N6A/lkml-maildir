My intention was to verify which one of the two possible execution paths
was taken, and also to verify that swap_duplicate doesn't see any problem
(there's a missing error check here).  Note that we also definitively
eliminated your original theory since we didn't arrive at the
page_cache_release via the if (page->mapping) path.

Is there any such thing as kdb for S390?
