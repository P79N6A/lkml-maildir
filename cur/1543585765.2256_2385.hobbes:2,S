Ever thought about how you would kill a process: kill -9 127892752 doesn't
sound very appealing to me.
So you'd also need to implement a mechanism that allows for 'easy' selection
of processes to kill, for example giving every process with the same name
a unique identifier (like httpd_0, httpd_1, httpd_2 and so on).
