It's only going to paper over this problem, because a window scale
of 2 still gets edited by the firewalls yet doesn't cause the
kind of damage 7 does.
Also, using a value of 7 is very safe, because it handles even the
tinyest of MTU's in use today (512 byte SLIP connections, for example
can still advertise sub-MTU sized chunks in the window).  Since
a window scale of 7 allows a granularity of 128 octets.
