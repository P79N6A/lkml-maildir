It does not build anymore. It seems that someone thinks Debian has db3
(it does not, at least not the stable release which is all that
matters).
I already had two links:
	/usr/lib/libdb.so -> /usr/lib/libdb2.so
	/usr/include/db   -> /usr/include/db2
that made it work for the last few patches - why break it now?
Of course, the best thing is to remove the whole db3 dependancy from
the kernel build and leave it in a special driver developer rule.
