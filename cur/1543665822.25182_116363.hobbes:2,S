I just compile perl-5.8.0, and then install it.

Seems like its creating 'Hash::Util.tmp' as a directory for some reason,
while it should be a 'tmp' file when installing the man pages.
Is there some other hash algorithm I could try ?  Just to verify if it
is that ?  Problem is that If I try to recreate it without the make
install, I do not really succeed.
