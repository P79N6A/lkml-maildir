It _IS_ statistics info about the number of interrupts and has no fixed
meaning at all. It does not cause any user space regression, as the
interface is still the same. It produces different numbers, like the
clock_getres() syscall returns different values on highres and !highres
systems.

So it's a problem of user perception and not of a user space regression.
Please stop confusing things.

Ok. Each irqaction struct which is used to request/setup an interrupt
contains a name field. This is the one which shows up
in /proc/interrupts. The one which is used to setup irq0 has .name =
"timer".

Sigh.

No. No. No. clockevents has nothing to do with /proc/interrupts.
/proc/interrupts is the statistics interface for the IRQ subsystem.

Because local apic timer is better.
