Hi Stephen,
We have a software package that spawns lots of recursive make processes
and compilers when built.  We build it all the time, many multiple
times per day, and usually without any problem, but I've noticed that
the machine usually hangs up when someone is doing a build.
This particular Oops happened while doing a backup of another machine
via "rmt" and running a script that creates different packages of
our product.  I'm told that this script creates a lot of temporary
files and thrashes the disk fairly well.  The Oops listed the script
as the process that caused the crash.
I'm wondering if these previous "silent freezes" I've been having may
actually be giving Oops's, but I just can't see them because the
screen is blank and the kernel is too hosed to unblank it.  What is
it exactly that causes the console to blank after a while.  I'm sure
it's something easy, I'm just having a hard time finding it.  The
machine is running RH 5.2.
Any suggestions for tracking this sort of thing down are welcome.
Mark
