Note: it _is_ the people too, don't get me wrong. But in other areas we 
have people like Al Viro, who can drive grown men to cry (and drink) with 
his not-very-polite postings. And in those areas it hasn't been a huge 
problem, even though some people probably take a valium or two before they 
dare open emails from Al.
So the messiness and interconnectedness of the IDE layer just seems to
bring the people problem to a sharp and ugly point. The absolute lack of
communication skills wrt IDE among the people who have worked on it has
been stunning, and that probably _is_ because the code is so hard to even 
talk about.
