I'm totally against that.

The i386 clocksource had always trouble with that. e.g.  I have a box
where the TSC works perfectly fine on a 64bit kernel, but since the new i386
clocksource code is in it always insists on disabling it shortly after boot.
My guess is that some of the checks in there are just broken and need
to be fixed.

It's unrealistic and short term it will cause extreme pain in many workloads
which are gettimeofday intensive (networking, databases etc.)
