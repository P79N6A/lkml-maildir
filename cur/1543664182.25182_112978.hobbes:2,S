This patch shouldn't affect DM's interaction with sysfs.
The names in sysfs are generated by the DM core, and are all called "dm-x", 
where x is the device minor number.
The names referred to in the above patch are used only by the device-mapper 
ioctl interface, and are not seen by the DM core. These are the names 
generated by the user-space tools, and are the ones that are passed to devfs, 
which doesn't have a problem with embedded slashes.
