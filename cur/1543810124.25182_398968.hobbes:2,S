fine, agreed on this finally, same for OpenVZ.

also fine.

but why sys_waitpid? we can make it in many other ways,
can't we? moreover, sys_waitpid() is the most unnatural from my point of 
view, since container is not fully dead when the last process dies, it 
makes some cleanup postponed.
And we had issues in OpenVZ, that very fast VPS stop/start can fail due 
to not freed resources yet.

then it is not disjoin? :)

but should parent see pspace init? only one task from pspace?

disagree. why we need to introduce copy of existing syscalls?
do you want to fix all the existing apps? ps, top, kill etc.? How about 
third party apps?

agreed. Though I don't like a backdoor name :) It is just a way to get 
access to VPS.
