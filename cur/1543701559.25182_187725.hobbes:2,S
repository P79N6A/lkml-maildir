Repeat: This is a hack, nothing else.
*You* need it for your thesis, so go ahead.  The right solution for
the problem, which is research, rather than engineering.  But don't
think this mess should be integrated into mainline, much less tell
other people it should.
*Noone* needs it for real code that is supposed to do something
meaningful.  Some people feel they need it, but they just haven't
found the right solution yet and believe this hack to be right.  It
isn't.
Clear enough?
