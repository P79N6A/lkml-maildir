  The problem with BP6 and MPS1.4 also shows in Win2k, where the usb
root hub is not initialized properly (yellow question mark in device
manager, and error code: you bios does not initialize the firwmare
properly with enough information for configuration, contact your
vendor...) and on 
http://www.bp6.com
 it says: "Install Detail: Set youe
MPS to 1.1 when using Win2k to solve USB Root HUB problems. MPS 1.4
seems to cause the USB ports to not function.".
   And a question: isn't there anything to gain/loose when using MPS1.1
instead of MPS1.4?
