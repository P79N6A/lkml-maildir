Subject: reducing max segments expected to work?

Hello Jens et al,
Is reducing the max number of segments in the block layer supposed to 
work (as done in the patch below), or should i be sticking to mucking 
with MAX_PHYS_SEGMENTS?  I seem to get a kernel thatt cannot boot with 
the below patch applied, and was wondering if you're aware of any 
problems in this area.  I'll probably post something more detailed 
tomorrow after trying a few things.
