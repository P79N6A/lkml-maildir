Hi Paul,
	There seems to be a problem while booting with this patch applied
on an 8-way SMP (.config available). Here is where the boot process stops:
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 232k freed
INIT: version 2.78 booting
                        Welcome to Red Hat Linux
                Press 'I' to enter interactive startup.
Mounting proc filesystem:  [  OK  ]
Configuring kernel parameters:  [  OK  ]
modprobe: modprobe: Can't open dependencies file /lib/modules/2.5.6/modules.dep (No such file or directory)
