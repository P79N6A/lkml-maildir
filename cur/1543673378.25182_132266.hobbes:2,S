First much kudos goes to Jamies V. modem work which sped up my V.34 devel
quite a lot.
companies who use complex kernel functions are supposed to GPL, it doesn't mean they
do, and lets not tread down that path,lest Andre see me, proprietary modules suck
everybody knows it, they just keep quiet,
dare it desturb them making money.
Linus says in the credits file his position, although such a position is supposed to be taken
from the majority of users and not a few kernel hackers.
Anyway, as im selling a no license version of my software for £13,000 I can hardly complain.
The best opinion on their legality comes from RMS, and although im not a zealot, he did
write the license, Trawl MARC for lawyers, GNU, and RMS and see if you can find it.
Thanks for your help by working on V.
Cheers, Deano.
