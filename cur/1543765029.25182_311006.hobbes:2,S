Subject: [patch 195/198] serial: fix comments in 8250.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/12/121

From: Russell King <rmk+lkml@arm.linux.org.uk>
Fix the formatting of some comments in 8250.c, and add a note that the
register_serial / unregister_serial shouldn't be used in new code.
We do this here in preference to adding to linux/serial.h, since that is used
by a number of non-8250 drivers which pretend to be 8250.  It is not known
whether it would be appropriate to do so.
