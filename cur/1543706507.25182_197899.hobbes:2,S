Fully agreed. I did a grep on an entire tree, which produced a
list of sources dependent on hlist. Then I temporarily renamed
next, first and pprev fields and configured and built an image.
This brought up all references to hlists within dependent code,
I fixed what's needed and that produced patch #1. There's still
a chance something's left unnoticed.
