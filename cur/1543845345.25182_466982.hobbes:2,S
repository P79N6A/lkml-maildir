Followup:
Without the P-States driver (CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ) enabled, both
virgin 2.6.18 and 2.6.18 with this patchset suspend/resume just fine,
and cpufreq (p4_clockmod) works fine.
Why CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ blows my box out of the water with the
patchset applied, I have no idea.  Enabling suspend tracing didn't do
anything for me except cause fsck to check my drive, me to reset my
clock, only to have fsck then check my drive yet again :)
