Dear Friend,
I am sending you this email through the internet with reservations,basically 
because you may perceive my intentions wrongly. 
The issue I want to reveal to you is a very classified and sensitive one. On 
your response I will send you the details and more information about myself and 
this mutually beneficial business.
Yours sincerely,
Andres Olev
