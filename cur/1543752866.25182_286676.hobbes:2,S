Thanks very much.  I know lots of embedded folks who will be happy to
see this discussion take place.  (As an aside, I'll try to encourage
some of our more shy members to speak up and participate in the
discussion as well.  I know Hitachi has been doing some work on
tracing, and I'd hate to see duplicate effort.)
BTW - I agree with most of the relayfs comments.  It seems like overkill
for the kernel developer doing a "casual", ad-hoc trace.  I'll try to
work with Karim on the suggested improvements.
