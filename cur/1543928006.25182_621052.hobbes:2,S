OK
Who's supposed to be responsible for that?

I don't think that have to be only *one* medium as long as we're able to track
the bugs (see my last reply in the other thread).

That last solution doesn't scale very well ...
How about using the system in which it's possible to report bugs using both
email and a web interface?
We can request that the address of the bug tracker be added to the Cc lists of
bug reports sent by email and we can make it resend reports filed with it to
the appropriate mailing lists and with the appropriate email headers.  This is
technically doable.
