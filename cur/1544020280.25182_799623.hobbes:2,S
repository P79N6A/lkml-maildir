I agree. Personally, I never understood this too. But if we want to
remove this code we need the separate discussion, so I just moved it
to the caller's context.

It is always better to speedup things and to decrease the latency ;)
But I also think this and the next patch make the code simpler and
more clean. Now the only thing create_kthread() does is a plain fork()
and nothing else, this is imho good.

Great, thanks.
(btw, I thought about avoiding CPU_MASK_ALL_PTR too, but I didn't
 dare to mix 2 different things in one patch).
Oleg.
