Looks like I've found the error. My i386 assembler Blowfish module set
the D flag. Previous Linux kernels tolerated this, while 2.4 does
not. This also nicely explains the memset issue. With a cld at the
appropriate place it works now.
Is there any complete documentation on the assembler calling conventions?
