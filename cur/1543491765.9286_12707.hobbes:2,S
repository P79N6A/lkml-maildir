Or maybe he is just using old kernel without noticing it. That would
explain the parport strangenes and the need for kerneld.
To original poster:
What does uname -a report?
If you have redhat, did you put the kernel and System.map in /boot like
redhat wants? If they are in / like the kernel default is, redhat will
ignore it since it has lilo conf. pointing to /boot.
If so, uncomment the INSTALL_PATH line in kernel toplevel makefile and
make zlilo.
