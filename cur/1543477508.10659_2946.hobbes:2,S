You can expect linear scalement ONLY in very limited special cases -
and that is something you learn pretty early in lectures about parallel
machines. Although application and OS implementation, of course, also
have impact on the scalabilty. It can be supported or spoiled.
Hiding latencies that come from locks, however, is always important, UP
or SMP.
