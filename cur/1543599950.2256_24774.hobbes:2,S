The config is random but valid, it passes the CML1 validation checks.
randconfig is useful for finding errors in the CML1 checks, it also
finds errors in code which assume that a feature is always present.

At the moment, randconfig, allyes, allno, allmod only work for CML1.
Doing randconfig in CML2 is awkward, it may be added later.
