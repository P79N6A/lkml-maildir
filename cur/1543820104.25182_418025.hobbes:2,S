Where's the problem, if a developer does not know whether an object is NULL 
or not, he may call kfree(). If, on the other hand, he is sure it is NULL, 
there is no need to refree it, and if he is sure it is non-NULL, he can 
directly call __kfree(). So the readability can never suffer - you never 
need an if(x==NULL) anymore.
