Subject: [PATCH] fix cciss DMA unmap brokenness
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

   The CCISS driver seems to loose track of DMA mappings created by it's
fill_cmd() routine.  Neither callers of this routine are extracting the
DMA address created in order to do the unmap.  Instead, they simply try
to unmap 0x0.  It's easy to see this problem on an x86_64 system when
using the "swiotlb=force" boot option.  In this case, the driver is
leaking resources of the swiotlb and not causing a sync of the bounce
buffer.  Thanks
