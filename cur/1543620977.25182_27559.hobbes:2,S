I got these messages just a few minutes ago, while nothing else
interesting was happening. Hardware: Toshiba Satellite 2595CDS (it's a
Celeron, based on the 440BX and PIIX and all that), and my kernel is
2.4.17+O(1)k3+rmap12e. Dunno who this involves, or if it was just a
random thing, but I Cc'd rik considering that it's in mm/ and I've got
rmap in. :)

I'll try to supply more info if it's needed, but as nothing locked up
(in fact, the system seems normal so far, I'm still sending my mail on
it), I don't have any backtrace info or anything like that. [unhandled content-type:application/pgp-signature]
