We already have to handle this situation for direct-io read()s into
hugepages.  bio_set_pages_dirty() does
		if (page && !PageCompound(page))
			set_page_dirty_lock(page);
It's such a rare case that it's probably best to continue to do this in the
caller rather than in the callee.  That's access_process_vm().
Unless there's a reason why we actually want the compound page to be marked
dirty?  If there is, then direct-io has a problem.
