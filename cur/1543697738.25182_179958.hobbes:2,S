Dongles all use the same scheme! This means that if you've made
one program that uses a dongle, you can certainly emulate it!

It'll keep honest people pissed and others entertained. In the
DOS days, there were holes burned into the floppies in certain
sectors. This kept diskcopy and other DOS stuff from copying
the floppies.  I just made a TSR that emulated the burnt holes
for the application and a copy routine that didn't care about
bad sectors (it ignored them).
The result was that you didn't need a "key" disk in drive A:
anymore. To the user, you just executed the program.
