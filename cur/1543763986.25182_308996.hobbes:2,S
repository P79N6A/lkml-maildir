Because the keyspan headers seem to have a specific sequence of
operations, something like 'load these 5 bytes at offset 10, load this
byte at offset 0, etc.' I don't know if there is some magic in that
sequence. Without knowing what is in the firmware, it looks to me like a
little bit of bootstrap code is loaded first.
