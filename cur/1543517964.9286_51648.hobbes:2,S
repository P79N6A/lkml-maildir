In <linux/capability.h> this capability is defined
but in the linux-priv website it doesn't appear to
exist. I'm looking at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/doc/linux-privs.html/linux-privs-2.html
The code seems to be present but it also seems to 
masked out of every process from init down.
Any pointers?
