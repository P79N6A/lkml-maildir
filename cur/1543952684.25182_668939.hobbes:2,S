Hmm, I can see how that might be ugly.  On the other hand it doesn't
seem like the unix way for a process not to be able to do something
with a file if it has a valid fd.

I don't think it's super-urgent.  If you can't do it, say, by the end
of this week, then I'll apply Pavel's patch so we don't block his
progress on namespace stuff.  But I would still like to get a patch to
move this out of ehca at some point, so please don't drop it.
If you guys think there is value in having the checks, then please
send a patch to add the ownership stuff to the uverbs core and we can
argue about it then.
Thanks,
  Roland
