The long term writer and maintainer of advansys
drivers for Linux has moved onto another job. He
was working on 3.3A and I tested it with mixed
results on the mid lk 2.3 development kernel series.
On reflection the problems I encountered were
probably more attributable to the SCSI subsystem
(then in a state of flux) and kernel instability
than the advansys 3.3A driver. That driver supports
advansys's u3w cards [which don't seem to have
reached the market yet]. I was also told that the
3.3A driver has better (DMA) throughput on wide
cards compared to the 3.3M driver.
So now that things have stabilized I may try the 3.3A
driver again. There is also some work being done
on 3.3B driver.
Getting 3.3A into the kernel would require someone
at advansys (sorry connectcom [what a dreadful name])
pursuing the issue.
