Well, considering that I had to look at half a dozen web pages via Google  
to make sure that ethernet did, indeed, use decimal, despite having been  
in the industry for about a decade, I'd say that this *would* help.
And the newbie would at least recognize that there is something going on,  
learning about which just might be a good idea. And the answer would  
presumably come not out of a standard, but out of a FAQ.

A lied-about one. These abominations deserve to die, yesterday.  
Preferrably messily.

If you're selling it to me, I certainly do.
