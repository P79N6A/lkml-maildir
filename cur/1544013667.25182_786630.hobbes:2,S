As long as that's an open question, the ioctl interface shouldn't get
merged into the kernel, or should get in as btrfsdev, otherwise you
get stuck with the current ABI forever.
Is it possible to separate out the nonstandard ioctls into a patch
that can get merged when the interface is final, or will that make
btrfs unusable?
