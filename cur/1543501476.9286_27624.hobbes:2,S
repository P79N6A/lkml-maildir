We've written several drivers for the 9080 (and the 9060 before it).
If you get stuck I'd be glad to help.  (If you're not aware
of Rubini's _Linux Device Drivers_ book, it is very helpful.)

Well, I'm not sure how to do this, but the next best thing is
to provide simple ioctl()s for reading and writing the PLX registers
and the local bus, then call them from user space.  But even
kernel-level debugging is fairly quick and easy given printk()
and the ability to insert and remove kernel modules.
