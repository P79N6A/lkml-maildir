As I suggested in the original post, the problem can be triggered simply by 
executing ./configure - the kernel corrupts when gcc does its thing. I can 
boot into KDE, run Enemy Territory, execute a Java compile, and so on. But 
the thing absolutely and most definitely able to upset the cart is to execute 
gcc.
Oh, I've even recompiled libgcc etc using a variety of optimisation flags 
(Gentoo is my distro), from the sooper-over-the-top P4 flags down to simple 
-O2 -march=pentium3. With no effect.

Because I have exhausted my own meagre talents in the search for the cause (eg 
swapping hardware, altering config parameters, using different hard drives, 
etc) I felt the time was right to 'call in the experts'.

I've done that, too, oddly enough. The config, cpuinfo, pci, the works. It's 
all there in the original thread.

The nearest I've got is someone who has the same mobo but with different CPUs, 
no AGP graphics card and no SATA.
Like I said, as a software engineer of some 20 years (heavens! I had my first 
game published when I was 14, lovingly handcrafted in 65c102 assember), I am 
aware of the steps required to pinpoint an issue. The penultimate one - the 
last, of course, is to give up - is to enlist the help of others who know 
more. That is what I've done.
