It gets rejects in arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_binfmt.c and
arch/ia64/ia32/binfmt_elf32.c - someone has been dinking with your
put_dirty_page() prototype.  I dropped those bits.
And I added the missing bit:

Now, what should the kernel do if the executable requests EXSTACK_DISABLE_X
but the kernel cannot do that?  Is it not a bit misleading/dangerous to
permit the executable to run anyway?
