Let me repeat this, and call it an observation instead of a question,
so that you do not think I am in doubt.
If you have 20000 processes, and do ps, then get_pid_list() will be
called 1000 times, and the for_each_process() loop will examine
10000000 processes.
Unlike the get_pid() situation, which was actually amortized linear with a very
small coefficient, here we have a bad quadratic behaviour, still in 2.5.37.
