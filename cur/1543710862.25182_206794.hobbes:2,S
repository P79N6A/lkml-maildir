Hi.
Just wanting clarification; what are we thinking about the future of
suspend implementations? Let me throw my current
understanding/suggestion in for starters:
- Drop PM_DISK?
- Apply patches making swsusp into suspend2, leaving out freezer changes
until people are convinced the current solution is insufficient.
- Pavel keeps maintaining the end result? (I'm happy to maintain it if
he wants; I'm assuming when I say this he'll still be dealing with S3
and Patrick will be deal with PM support proper).
Nigel
