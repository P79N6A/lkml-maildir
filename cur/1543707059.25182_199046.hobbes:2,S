I don't think this is right.
It gets the same-tty case wrong, and the reason it gets it wrong is that 
it does its thing in entirely the wrong place.
The console layer already always calls "unblank_screen()" on any switch to
text mode, _regardless_ of whether it was switching from another console
or not. That should be the place where this is done, and perhaps by
changing the console layer to be a bit more helpful about things (mainly
re-name the damn thing, since it has nothing to do with "unblank" any
more).
"unblank_screen()" is really the same as "reset_screen" - it's also called
on resume. While "do_blank_screen()" is basically "go away".
So why don't you just reset the thing in "con_blank()" that gets called in 
all the right cases?
