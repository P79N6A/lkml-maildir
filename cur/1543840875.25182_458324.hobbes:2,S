Hehe, okay, going after them.
sparc64 lib:  this is actually LGPL, but I'm not sure what it applies
to. If specific files are under LGPL, I guess they should say that in
headers... Plus, not *all* files seems like LGPLed to me:
atomic32.c: * Based on asm-parisc/atomic.h Copyright (C) 2000 Philipp Rumpf
...I do not think atomic.h from parisc was LGPL. Dave?
oss/COPYING... I guess we can just remove that one. I do not think we
have maintainer for OSS. Should I submit deleting patch for Andrew, or
Andrew, can you just rm sound/oss/COPYING?
