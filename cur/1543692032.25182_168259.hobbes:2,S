Ok, well that is a start then.  I am running Redhat's latest kernel
2.4.20-20.9 though I also have 2.4.0test4 on the machine.  I haven't tried
it under 2.4.0test4 though.  I just didn't have enough time this morning
when the error surfaced.  Are they in 2.4.22?  Because looking through the
changelog, I see a bunch of AC's and other fixes for IDE items, but I don't
see anything about this boundrey?  Did it go in before then?
Thanks for the help
Brent
