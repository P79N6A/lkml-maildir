Not all (yet).
o It is one programm with multiple frontends:
	old,
	text,
	ncurses,
	random,
	maximum,
	minimum,
	syntax checking
	(X is still missing as my brain is not made for GUI programming)
o An 'show me all options and handle the rest' mode is still missing -
  my devel tree has something like that in the works, but I'll probably
  never finish it now that CML2 is official.
o it still has multiple top-level config.in.  Again that is easily fixable
  and in fact I did a patch for it (including {old,menu,x}config support
  in 2.3 times but never submitted it.
Something missing?

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
