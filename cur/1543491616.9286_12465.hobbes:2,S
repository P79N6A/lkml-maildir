Here's a hopefully useful bug report.  Someome please let me know if
I need to report more info.  I don't read l-k too regularly, so cc:'ing
me would be helpful.
Building 2.2.4 with process accounting turned on dies in the following
way:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -D__SMP__ -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686   -c -o acct.o acct.c
acct.c: In function `sys_acct':
acct.c:197: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
acct.c:203: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
make[2]: *** [acct.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make: *** [_dir_kernel] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/kernel
