Unfortunately I think there have been a lot of "we can't talk to them" 
on both sides of the kernel-gcc interface, which is incredibly 
unfortunate.  I personally try to at least observe gcc development, 
including monitoring #gcc and knowing enough about gcc internals to 
write a (crappy) port, but I can hardly call myself a gcc expert. 
Still, I am willing to spend some significant time interfacing with 
anyone in the gcc community willing to spend the effort.  I think we can 
do good stuff.
