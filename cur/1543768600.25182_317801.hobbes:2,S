The dirty pages will float about in memory until something causes them to
be written back.  That "something" could be
msync/fsync/sync/pdflush/journal commit or, eventually, the VM system
deciding that it wants to reuse that physical page for something else.
So yes, the page will eventually be written to the server, but not for
quite some time.
In the case where the page was dirtied by mmap and was then unmapped (via
munmap or via program exit), the page will be marked dirty in pagecache
when its pagetable entry is unmapped.  That makes the page's dirtiness
visible to the VFS and the page will be written out approximately 30
seconds later by pdflush.
