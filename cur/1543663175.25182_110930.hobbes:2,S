    Hi all :))
    I would like to know if adding the bits of information that
/etc/mtab has and /proc/mount doesn't needs a lot of work. The
problem here is that /etc/mtab, although traditional, does not make
sense in systems where /etc is mounted read-only. Usually, the only
reason for mounting it read-write is the mtab...
    Well, nowadays is very usual to see systems where /etc/mtab is
just a symlink to /proc/mounts, but then you lose some information.
That is, you can live without that info, but if it can be easily
added I think that it would worth the effort.
    Unfortunately, some of this information is obtained from
/etc/fstab but IMHO the kernel has that info too in some table, I
suppose...
    Well, if someone familiar with this part of the kernel gives me
the information I think I can write the code for the 'extra'
information ;))
    I give an example of this extra information:
    in /etc/mtab we have:
        pts /dev/pts devpts rw,gid=5,mode=620 0 0
    in /proc/mounts we have:
        pts /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
    Other filesystems, as tmpfs, has the size information, for
example, etc...
    Thanks in advance.
    Raúl
