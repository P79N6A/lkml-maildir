Maybe additional comment reminding that you most likely don't want this
interface.
Also, looks like there's same issue again:
drivers/usb/core/devio.c::usbdev_open()
	...
	ps->disctask = current;
drivers/usb/core/inode.c::usbfs_remove_device()
	...
			send_sig_info(ds->discsignr, &sinfo, ds->disctask);
