The patch looks good.  We will still flush everything in the
TLB that we used to flush before, but by not using struct
page in the buffer for non-existant and reserved pages we can
flush the TLB in much larger intervals.
Marcelo, could you please apply this patch for 2.4.22-pre ?
(I'll keep a copy here and will resend it to you if needed)
