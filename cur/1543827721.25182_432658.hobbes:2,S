Yes, that appears to be the case with Windows Vista:

*However*, they're also adding "black hole detection", for working
around broken boxes that drop ICMP. And that kinda makes me wonder how
long they're going to stick to their guns for enabling window scaling.
(For instance, if too many sites break, maybe they'll disable it again
with Vista Service Pack 1 or something.)
