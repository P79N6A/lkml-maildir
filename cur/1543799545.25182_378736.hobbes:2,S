Not to mention that when this gets into the kernel, Andrew's the one that
will have to deal with a ton of "switch semaphores to mutexes" patches
that will slowly update the entire kernel.  These patches will probably
continue to come in for a few years. ;)
IIRC, that was one of his rational reasons why he didn't want the timer
name change.
