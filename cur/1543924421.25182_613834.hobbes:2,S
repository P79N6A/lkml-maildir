I'll take your word for it, and apologize for my slur on slub!
(Slub has a great deal to admire in it, I should say.)

Mmm, I'd been doing slabinfo -v sometimes.  These are fine in some
situations, but it's always better when the observer can avoid
interfering with the observed.  Impossible, we know, but...
Also, many caches too quickly re-equip themselves
with cpu slabs which again obscure the numbers.

Gosh, that's a tighter corner than any I've been in.

I'll have to read up on that, thanks for the pointer.
