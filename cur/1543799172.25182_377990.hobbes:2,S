If you look at something like the early unix design books its very deep
into the design of the most basic behaviour and primitives. It would be
possible to fix that in Linux but probably not worth it. The 1 page you
need for stack is now cheap.
I did look at fixing it for ELKS where a big part of the 64K DS space is
kernel stacks but fortunately something useful needed doing instead ;)
