The bug appeared in mainline due to the latest x86 merge. The commit
that caused the bug is not faulty though:
commit 12c247a6719987aad65f83158d2bb3e73c75c1f5
    x86: fix boot failure on 486 due to TSC breakage
    1. arch/x86/kernel/tsc_32.c:tsc_init() sees !cpu_has_tsc,
       so bails and calls setup_clear_cpu_cap(X86_FEATURE_TSC).
    2. include/asm-x86/cpufeature.h:setup_clear_cpu_cap(bit) clears
       the bit in boot_cpu_data and sets it in cleared_cpu_caps
    3. arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:identify_cpu() XORs all caps
       in with cleared_cpu_caps
       HOWEVER, at this point c->x86_capability correctly has TSC
       Off, cleared_cpu_caps has TSC On, so the XOR incorrectly
       sets TSC to On in c->x86_capability, with disastrous results.

Now the commit fixed everything, and x86_capability shows the right
thing (TSC = off). 
On the lguest _guest_ side, 'cpu_has_tsc' is _always_ false (due to 
lguest using his own clocksource ?), thus a guest with a pentium+ 
cpu always panics with:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_TSC
	if (!cpu_has_tsc)
		panic("Kernel compiled for Pentium+, requires TSC feature!");
#endif
In older kernels (2.6.23), the problem was also hidden using 'tsc_disable':
tsc.c:
	if (!cpu_has_tsc || tsc_disable)
		tsc_disable = 1;
bug.c:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_TSC
	if (!cpu_has_tsc && !tsc_disable)
		panic("Kernel compiled for Pentium+, requires TSC feature!");
#endif
I've tried solving the problem with several tweaks including something like:
	/* If we're running on a pentium+, fake an enabled TSC to bypass
	 * kernel checks for processor bugs (see x86/cpu/bugs.c) */
	if (boot_cpu_data.x86 >= 5)
		setup_force_cpu_cap(X86_FEATURE_TSC);
with no luck at all. 
Any idea how to solve this problem in a right/mergeable way ?
Thank you,
