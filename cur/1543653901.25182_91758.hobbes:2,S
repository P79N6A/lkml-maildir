It may be honoured more in the breach than the observance, but it's a custom 
nonetheless.

No, look at e.g. SCSI.  We have a scsi.h file in drivers/scsi which defines 
subsystem specific things that we only use within SCSI.  We have 
include/scsi/scsi.h which defines things other subsystems can use.

Because the files are spreading.  I think there's value to keeping something 
tightly contained unless you're going to encourage others to use it.  
Interfaces are dangerous things: If you release them into the wild 
willy-nilly, they can come back and bite you (athough more often they just 
bite other people).
