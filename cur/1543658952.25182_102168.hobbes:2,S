I'm having trouble seeing the trouble.
From your dmesg:
| pnp: the driver 'parport_pc' has been registered
| pnp: pnp: match found with the PnP device '00:12' and the driver 'parport_pc'
| pnp: the device '00:12' has been activated

I'm not using PnP.  With 2.5.54, I see:
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [PCSPP(,...)]
lp0: using parport0 (polling).
Are you expecting to see the "lp0" line also?
