Ok ok ok, suspend-to-disk has some other uses, too.
But ... you are really using suspend-to-disk as a workaround for "my
desktop takes too much power when idle". Imagine pressing "lock
screensaver" combination, and your machine going to low power mode
(3W?), immediately. (Quiet, too; you can't generate much noise for
3W). In the morning, you'd just press any key, machine would power up,
immediately... ok, you'd have to ifconfig eth0 down, so that spurious
packets on the local net would wake your machine, with all its fans
etc.
