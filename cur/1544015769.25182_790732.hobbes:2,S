Complicated ;-)
There were two device drivers for the Axon PCIe endpoint (from Mercury
and IBM), but both were abandoned due to being too complex to get into
a mergeable stage, and all the original developers are doing other work
now.
I'm maintaining the IBM driver now, but have no plans to submit that
for inclusion. I hope that I can soon find more time to work on a
replacement driver that will provide the right abstraction through
virtio for kernel drivers, plus a ibverbs user interface for direct
application programming. It should also have pluggable backends to
support not only Cell hardware but anything with a similar hardware
implementation.
I did make a presentation about this at the Plumbers Conference, see
http://userweb.kernel.org/
%7Earnd/papers/plumbers08/plumbers-slides.pdf.
Since then, I have come to a much clearer idea of what needs to be
done, but not more actual code.
