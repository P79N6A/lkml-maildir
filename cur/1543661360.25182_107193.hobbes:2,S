Interesting.
So, what sw does one need for this CPU C state? Which kernels support it /
which patches are needed? 2.5 only?
Also, which CPUs support it? Am I out of luck with my measly 1.4 Celeron
Tualatin?
So far I've only been doing "Make CPU Idle calls when idle", which I gather
is far from optimal?
