It does half the job. You can make sure the driver is not asked to access
freed memory.
It is true that a driver will have to mark that device "disconnected"
and return errors if that device's attributes are referenced, but this can
be done internally.
Yes, this is a bit more complicated.

Who came up with the idea of making life simpler by adding a code path?
All these problems were already solved for device nodes. Ioctl is ugly, but
at least a known code path.

Yes, this is implied.
