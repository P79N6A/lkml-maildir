Ok, great.  Now hopefully everyone can cool their pants on the

Right, sounds fine to me.

I see.  Well that clarifies things quite a bit now.  Sounds ok to
me.  If there is one thing that I've noticed in some of these GPL
threads, it is that the SPECIFIC wording of ones words, or of a
license, or explanation - can be interpreted by many people in a
plethora of completely different ways - myself included.  In my
case it was the word "exceptions" which I interpreted as
"additional restrictions" - and now I understand that that
assumption was incorrect.
Take care!
Happy New Year!
