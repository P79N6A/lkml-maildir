Subject: IDE: PDC20275 turning on/off DMA dangerous?

Hello!
I am working on an embedded ppc (mpc8540) using a pretty common Promise IDE
PCI controller w/ a PDC20275 on it (it's called Ultra TX2).
I have an otherwise good Maxtor 6B120P0 (160GB) connected to it.
But sometimes (expecially with more than zero disk-i/o-load), when I
turn on DMA by
$hdparm -X69 -d1 /dev/hda
I get 
hda: task_out_intr: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: CHECK for good STATUS
And when I turn off DMA with 
$hdparm -d0 /dev/hda
I get sometimes a
hda: DMA disabled
which is fine but sometimes I also get:
hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: drive not ready for command
hda: CHECK for good STATUS
which is not so nice.
Can you tell me if this is dangerous?
$ uname -a 
Linux ecam.anagramm.de 2.6.13-rc7 #5 Thu Aug 25 15:33:38 CEST 2005 ppc ppc ppc GNU/Linux
I am about to update to the latest 2.6.15-rc5.
Thanks,
