I'm also curious as to why this had to creep back. Is there some reason to
set multmode on bootup in the kernel? Andre, if you're reading, please
comment ...
As far as I can see, this is totally unnecessary; my own faulting drive
(also a Seagate, but different model --> ST34321A) uses DMA for transfers
and multmode is actually set off later in the boot process.
