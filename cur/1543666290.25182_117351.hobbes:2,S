Question 1:
Larry - what would it cost to *buy* Linus and company a license?
Question 2:
What's the average pay scale for the people participating in this flame-fest,
in US$/hour, and how many hours have we spent on it?
Proposal:
Somebody start up a PayPal fund or something, and everybody contribute $N
to buy Linus a license in lieu of further bickering.
Geez. ;)
