I'm fine with the patch.
The above sounds x86 xen potentially has the same issue, though.
linux-2.6/arch/x86/xen $ grep __initdata *
enlighten.c:static const struct pv_info xen_info __initdata = {
enlighten.c:static const struct pv_init_ops xen_init_ops __initdata = {
enlighten.c:static const struct pv_time_ops xen_time_ops __initdata = {
enlighten.c:static const struct pv_cpu_ops xen_cpu_ops __initdata = {
enlighten.c:static const struct pv_apic_ops xen_apic_ops __initdata = {
enlighten.c:static const struct pv_mmu_ops xen_mmu_ops __initdata = {
enlighten.c:static const struct machine_ops __initdata xen_machine_ops = {
irq.c:static const struct pv_irq_ops xen_irq_ops __initdata = {
smp.c:static const struct smp_ops xen_smp_ops __initdata = {
