Hello,  
I have just installed and compiled 2.5.64-mm1 using gcc-3.2.2 and, when booting the system, I have found the  
following error on the kernel ring:  
Badness in request_irq at arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:475  
Call Trace: [<c010afdd>]  [<d08b3d3a>]  [<d08b18c0>]  [<d08b42c8>]  [<d08b024e>]  [<d08b42b0>]

[<d08b49e8>]  [<c0191eab>]  [<d08b49e8>]  [<d08a0019>]  [<d08b49c0>]  [<d08bb160>]  [<c01302cd>]   
[<c010969e>]  
This didn't happen with stock 2.5.64. I have attached the "config" file used to build the kernel along with a 
"dmesg" of the offending kernel. 
Please, contact me for further information :-)  
Best regards,
