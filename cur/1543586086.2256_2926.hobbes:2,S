Firstly, I'm relatively new to Linux (only about 3 yrs experience) &
don't claim to be an expert.  Secondly, I don't think I stated my point
very clearly.
No, I don't have write permissions set on an executable for any user
other than the owner.
What I meant was that if a file is owned by root with permissions of,
say, 555 (r-xr-xr-x), not setuid or setgid, then another executable
run as a non-root user cannot modify it or change the permissions to
7 (rwx).

I completely agree (even with the PEBCAK part :)).  UNIX security on
corporate networks or public-facing systems should be left to experts.
I, on the other hand, am a home-user trying to learn how Linux works &
how to secure it, I don't pretend to be an expert.
My policy is to give necessary permissions & no more.  I would set the
aforementioned permissions on the main system binaries which would allow
other users to get on with what they need to do without being able to
affect the workspaces of other users, only their own.
I'm open to contructive criticism on this.
