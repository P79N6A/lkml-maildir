Yep, sorry this slipped into the kernel. It's my fault for not giving
Andrew a fix for it.
As you might know, page refcounting in nommu was already broken, so
I'm working on a proper solution to fix it.
In the meantime though, this is a step backwards and reintroduces
NOMMU special-casing in page refcounting. As a temporary fix, what I
think should happen is simply for all slab allocations to ask for
__GFP_COMP pages.
Could you check that fixes your problem?
Thanks,
Nick
