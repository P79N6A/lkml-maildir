Which may not start at address zero either.
There are even ARM systems where it'd be useful to be able to say "only
allocate memory in region N where N = first 1MB of every 2MB region.
(Yes, I know, this broken hardware should die, but it just isn't going
away thanks to the marketing powers of large IC manufacturers.)
Maybe the generic solution could be something like the resource allocation
functions which are passed an alignment function?  /me hides.
