Yes, I recognised the patch because I passed Balbirs version over to
Micheal Cohen in early 2002. The patch originaly was intended for 2.4
Complexity of Stevens patch has gone, readability has improved, Steven
has taken advantage of context-code and the rationale has been
explained in the comment.
Sounds fine to me.
