We are talking about a kexec based hibernate.  All of the above just
doesn't apply in that case.
I'm not contending, that the current hibernation (epecially Pavel's
new userspace based one) needs a frozen userland.

The order in which tasks are relying on each other to be able to
finish a syscall.
Mount order says _nothing_ about tasks.
