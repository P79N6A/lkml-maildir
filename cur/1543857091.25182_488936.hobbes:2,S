This description doesn't match my experience.
The patch in #promise-sata-pata should work for 2037x chips.
It doesn't work on 2057x chips because it doesn't remove
ATA_FLAG_SATA from board_2057x. That omission causes libata
to consider all ports on it as SATA, including the PATA port,
and that's why sata_scr_read() etc get invoked.
Applying the patch below on top of #promise-sata-pata fixes
this, and is all I had to do to get working PATA on my 20575.
