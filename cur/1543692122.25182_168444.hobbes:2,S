Now that I've thought of it (aren't I humble), I rather like CONFIG_HT.
It's simple and it's effects should be obvious to both developer and
user:
	CONFIG_HT, CONFIG_ACPI == ACPI
	!CONFIG_HT, CONFIG_ACPI == ACPI
	CONFIG_HT, !CONFIG_ACPI == HT-only ACPI
	!CONFIG_HT, !CONFIG_ACPI == no ACPI
Following the "autoconf model", what we really want to be testing with
CONFIG_xxx is _features_, where possible. "hyperthreading: yes/no" is
IMO more clear than "do I want ht-only ACPI or full ACPI", while at the
same time being more fine-grained and future-proof.

Point; agreed.
