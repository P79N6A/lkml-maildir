Or just use the current running values for max speed. That will fail if the
system boots at lower speeds on battery though. And the BIOS checks will
fail on buggy BIOSes and when upgrading the CPU. So maybe use both checks?

Outch! I did not know that...
Are the middle values needed? What if you only use the min and max 
fid/vid values, and always recalculate the stepping tables from those 
values?

Maybe not, if the stepping table would get recalculated on init?
