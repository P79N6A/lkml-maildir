Yes, but that is just because the Xen hooks happens to be near the last 
part of the merge.  VMI required some special hooks, as do both Xen and 
lhype (I think ... Rusty can correct me if lhype's puppy's have 
precluded the addition of new hooks).  Xen page table handling is very 
different, mostly it is trap and emulate so writable page tables can 
work, which means they don't always issue hypercalls for PTE updates, 
although they do have that option, should the hypervisor MMU model 
change, or performance concerns prompt a different model (or perhaps, 
migration?)
