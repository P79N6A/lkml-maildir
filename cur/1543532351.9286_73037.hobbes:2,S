Whenever Ion and I wanted to understand the VFS-f/s interaction, we often
looked at the VFS code, and samples of three file systems:
- msdos/fat: it's a small block-level f/s.  small enough that you can follow
  most of the code and understand it.
- ext2: does much more, in case msdos is too simple, but often we didn't
  need to look at ext2fs.
- nfs: b/c so much of the VFS was "hacked" to support NFS.  This helped us
  understand things that we didn't need to worry about in our stacking
  templates, b/c they were specific to NFS.
