It'll piss a few people off but it won't create time, the only thing
stopping the drm from getting this stuff out of the way is time, there
are two uses in the DRM, one is the agp one, this is easy, Rusty
posted a patch for this and I'll probably merge it up after the next
kernel release.. the other use requries moving to some sort of DRM
in-kernel core, again I'd rather do this at the start of a kernel
release cycle as it'll require a bit of testing to make sure we don't
break anything....
Most of this stuff is easier if we weren't waiting on Alans vga class
support driver to turn up as without it the DRM CVS is blocked, and no
DRM developer really wants to start hacking on the vga class stuff as
we don't believe it is where our time is best spent until Alan gets
code merged into the kernel and gets the fb guys to convert all their
drivers... I've already got a patch for converting the DRM to a fixed
up version of his last patch...
Dave.
