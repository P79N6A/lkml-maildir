I somewhat think choice 2 is better. The pre-load can be invoked in any
order instead of in the device tree hierarchy order. And currently only
few devices need it, is it worth adding it in the device core?
In addition, the notifiers have better flexibility. We can easily add
more notifier types if needed, such as adding a callback between the
sysdev resume and regular devices resume. To tell the truth, we actually
have the case. An ACPI link device must resume before regular devices
but must be with IRQ enabled. I'm considering add a call back between
sysdev and regular devices resume for the issue. I guess the MTRR driver
in SMP has the same requirement. Anyway, notifier solution sounds like
easier to extend, but we can't extend device core casually.
Thanks,
Shaohua
