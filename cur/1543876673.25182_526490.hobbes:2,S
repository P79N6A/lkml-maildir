Subject: [PATCH] vt: Expose system-wide UTF-8 default setting via sysfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/2/422

Create a variable, default_utf8, that defines the system-wide default UTF-8
setting.  This variable can be altered via sysfs. If the variable is properly
set, this should mimimize breakage of UTF-8 encoded consoles when doing a
reset or echo -e '\033c' and of newly opened/allocated consoles.
This is based from patches by Jan Engelhardt and Paul LeoNerd Evans.

Okay, you convinced me. Hopefully this is acceptable to all parties.
Andrew,
If everybody agrees, can you drop the previous patch I sent to you, and use
this instead?
