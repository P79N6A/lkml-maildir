	In my opinion, programs that rely on special features of the system clock
should enforce those requirements themselves. This is especially true for
programs that are intended to be portable.
	I wrote a 151 line implementation of a monotonic, safe clock for the
company I work for. Any program that implements timers and such and doesn't
sanitize the clock will get what it deserves.
