It's not clear how you are making this safe.  You aren't using one
of the known solutions to this problem.  For GC lock-free based solutions,
you can't use RCU since notify_call can sleep.  You could use a
form of reference counting but you'd have to implement it yourself.
Ditto on RCU+SMR or some other form of proxy GC.  Not implemented.
You could use COR (Copy On Read).  Make a copy of the list while holding
a lock, release the lock, do the notifications, and then delete the copy
of the list.
The non-blocking schemes can do notify_calls after unregistration so you
need to take this into account.  Whatever you're calling against still
has to be there and has to be in a meaningful state.
