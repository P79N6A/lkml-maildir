Inflexible, rc.whatever doesn't add persistence; devfsd adds a daemon for

OK with me.

What for? Permissions stay put.

Great! That's another reason why /dev/c0t4d2s7 is bad naming...

I assume you mean connecting and disconnecting _the same devices_ a couple
of times a day. What is wrong then with allocating fixed names in /dev for
your devices? What difference is there with popping floppies/CDs/Zips in
and out, and connecting via phone to the 'net, and disconnecting? In each
of these cases the actual setting up of the device is a trivial part of the
setting up for use. If you are lazy, you write a script. I did, and it sure
isn't something I want to add into the kernel: Just too personalized, and
not used the same way always either.
devfs is touted as *the* solution for people that do that routinely to
hundreds of different devices, in random order, all day long. Again, I've
yet to see anybody in that bind.

But will be named differently when moved around among controllers. AFAIR,
some PC SCSI controllers/devices assign targets to devices in the order in
which they are on the chain. So this problem is solved halfway, if that
much. Mounting by UUID/label works even then, with much less impact.

You are adding them into the middle of the chain, and it hurts? Add them at
the end, case solved.

OK, and devfs automatically makes your CD with your distribution's source
appear as /dev/Source, the binaries as /dev/Install? Cool! How does it do
that?
Removable media present _exactly_ the same kind of problem as (realistic,
not "hundreds of devices that appear and disappear willy-nilly")
hotswapping.  No real workable solution forthcoming for removable media
after all these years should tell you something...

Assuming major/minor is really a bad idea, devfs is just one way to move
away from them. To do that, it adds quite a lot of complexity, which is
very bad.

devfs _has_ a cost: in the kernel, in each device, in daemons.

And I as a developer for gizmos have to go searching all over the kernel
source so my naming and major/minor don't conflict with anybody else's. I'd
assume updating MAKEDEV is a bit easier.

Well, many people complain that startup/shutdown takes way too long right
now... Also, in the case of quotas what is recorded in the quota file are
static limits, the in-core structure keeps track of actual disk usage. The
in core devfs structure will have to be written out _each time_ the system
goes down. Even by unplugging it. This because you want to record
changeable information in it, critical information that _has_ to survive
reboots. No buts or ifs there.

Several. And F00F costs nothing in runtime, a trivial amount in RAM. SMP
hast't gone through iterations, it started crude and is being refined. VFS
has been worked over a few times, getting faster each time.
devfs was considered and rejected. A solution for the hotplugging problem
is being sought right now, devfs clearly doesn't cut it by far.

"version 0.1" (devfs) came out far short, didn't get even to "1". Next
candidate for "version 1" is being sought.

I just wonder how screwing around with devfs is less work than distributing
a /etc/rc.d/rc.devices script that sets up all devices as you see fit on
bootup if that is what worries you so. What the extra cost over hundreds of
machines is of the wasted memory and CPU cycles that go into devfs. OTOH,
IIUC, this is exactly what you have to do anyway if you want devfs to work
at all...

You don't have to handle it, others do. I don't have to handle it either,
and Richard doesn't have to spend a minute a year on my problems right
now. If devfs becomes more than the current extraofficial patch that some
few use, the support load _will_ go up, and not be a few minutes a week
anymore. 
What class of servers is that? How much of a difference does it make? Each
call, overall as a percentage of the load of the server? Are you sure that
the latest workovers given to the filesystem don't make any differences
there dissapear in the noise?

Right.

IPX, AX.25, DECnet, SNA, SMB and such are forced on us to interact with
more or less broken other systems. The miriard device drivers in the kernel
are needed to be able to use various devices over which Linux has no
control. devfs isn't needed in any of those ways at all.
