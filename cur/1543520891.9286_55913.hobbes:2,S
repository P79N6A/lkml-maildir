We've talked about this sort of thing in the past.  Linus is quite
interested in the possibility of adding write ordering for pending
writes or to the writeback queues, but really wants the buffer cache to
lose, not add, functionality.  Adding more complexity to the buffer
cache for cases like this just isn't going to be accepted.
