Shouldn't we have a pass to discard on unmount instead?  ->put_inode is
a really bad interface and all usages including this one are racy (not that
it matters too much here, but I'd like to get rid of it eventually).
As a band-aid to avoid the corruption it's certainly okay (and needed), but
we should try to fix this for real.  Mingming, do you want to look into it
or should I put it on my TODO list?
