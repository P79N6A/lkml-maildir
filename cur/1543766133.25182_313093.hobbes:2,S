Certainly possible.  Maybe all their real IP is in the code, although if
that was true, letting opensource peope ahve the programing spec and
have to do their own drivers wouldn't expose that IP.  I have no idea.

At least as far as I have understood things, the 3D hardware in the old
SGIs was very simple.  Lots and lots of multiple and add units which the
drivers then used in clever ways to implement fast 3D.  nvidia certainly
employs many ex-SGI people, so perhaps internally it is still based on
that idea, although I doubt it's quite that simple anymore.
