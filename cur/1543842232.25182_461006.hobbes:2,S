Btw, is there some reason for the __ASSEMBLY__ check?
I'm not seeing any kernel users that could care, a quick
	git grep 'mman\.h' -- '*.[sS]'
doesn't trigger anything, and the other header files that include this 
seem to all either be mman.h themselves, or have things like structure 
declarations etc that wouldn't work for any non-C source anyway.
But maybe I missed some.
I'd rather not have more of those '#ifndef __ASSEMBLY__' than necessary.
