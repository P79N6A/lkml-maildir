This is the latest release of the -tiny kernel tree. The aim of this
tree is to collect patches that reduce kernel disk and memory
footprint as well as tools for working on small systems. Target users
are things like embedded systems, small or legacy desktop folks, and
handhelds.
Latest release includes:
 - update to 2.6.2-rc3
 - add latest netdrvr patchkit (Jeff Garzik)
 - numerous compile warning fixes from last release
 - work for compiling with gcc 3.4
 - smaller, cleaned up inflate code for kernel, initramfs, etc.
 - optional support for file locking
 - optional support for uid16 interfaces
 - enhanced CPU feature selection (Adrian Bunk)
 - selectable vendor support for MTRRs
 - optional TSC timer support
 - optional ramfs-based shmem/tmpfs support
 - minor space-saving cleanups
As always, I'm looking for more ideas for space-savings. Suggestions
in the TCP/IP area are especially useful right now.
Here's a test boot of my development config (console, ide, ext2, and
ipv4) with mem=2m, which is actually only 1664k after accounting for
BIOS memory holes:
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.

# cat /proc/meminfo
