I'm having trouble making sense of this sentence. You will not need to
install EVERYTHING from Redhat just to compile a kernel, you will at
least need the developer's tools. If you install those tools on one
system, you can configure and build a kernel there for another system
and then move the built kernel and it's associated modules to another
system that is not "fully installed".

modutils is used for handling kernel modules (drivers that can be
installed and removed fomr a running kernel) in the Linux kernel
version 2.4. The Linux kernel version 2.6 uses module-init-tools.
