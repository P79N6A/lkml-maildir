Isn't it nice that I do that already in treescan :-)
However it doesn't take effect because I call the getdents system call
directly instead of calling Glibc getdirentries, and getdents does not
return a d_type field.  Glibc's getdirentries does some extra, redundant
system calls and subsequent data shuffling.  The overhead is measurable,
but not very significant in the scheme of things.
If the new system call simply implements Glibc's getdirentries, so that
Glibc will eventually be efficient, I will make the new version of
treescan always use getdirentries on the assumption that the binary is
ready to take advantage of the new kernel capability even when compiled
on older kernels.
