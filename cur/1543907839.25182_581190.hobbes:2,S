  Thank you very much indeed. I'm kind of proud too that I dared to enter
  this dark realm without bricking the system (at least up until now).
  And thanks for the tip. I'll give it a try.

  Absolutely right (bad bad typo, have to control my trembling fingers)
  It's 16/17.
  So that's ok ? No misconfiguration ? And that setserial tells
  me the port is 0x000 ? I thought the dts file which
  comes with the linkstation kernel describes the ports and IRQs
  but poking there didn't change anything. It seems like the kernel
  is ignoring the serial settings in the dts-file (which I do not
  realy understand) all together.

   I started with a debian distro

   Hmm I tried my very best to eliminate this everywhere. Actually I
   resurrected the ARV00 device by creating a soft link to a ttySx
   with during bootup within the udev filesystem.

         if [ ! -e /dev/AVR00 ];then
          cat /proc/tty/driver/serial | grep 80004500 | grep -q 0:
            && AVR=/dev/ttyS0 || AVR=/dev/ttyS1
          echo "Making AVR00 link to "$AVR;
          ln -s $AVR /dev/AVR00
         fi;
   </snip>
Stole the trick from the avr_evtd startup script...
Thanks a 10^6 for the tips...
