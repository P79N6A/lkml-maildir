There seems to be much more in the package, more developer tools, source code 
for the broadcom reference design etc. Good for the linksys router hackers, but 
unfortunately there is still no source code for the driver.
I think the driver files are in /release/src/wl. This directory contains only 
object files, no source code. The wl driver directory in the kernel tree ( 
release/src/linux/linux/drivers/net/wl ) is empty. 
I've checked the WAP54G, WAP55AG and WRT55AG archives and none of these contain 
the source code for the driver.
