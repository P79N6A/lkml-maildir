With the interfaces implemented here, a userspace application can create a 
multiseat environment either with a single graphics card with multiple 
outputs or multiple cards.  It could do this by creating several frame 
buffer objects and associating them with whatever CRTCs were available, 
and managing input via existing APIs.  I don't know of anyone that's done 
this yet though...
