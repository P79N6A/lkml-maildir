The userspace part will be released under the GPL along with the
hardware itself, Q4 '08.  Have changed the Kconfig text to reflect this.
Of course this means for the next few months I will be the only direct
user of this driver, but I'm also submitting it in the hope that I can
convince others that it's a good thing to do.  I'm an active member of
AVRFreaks, an AVR32 support forum, and I spend far too much of my life
trying to convince people that polling the peripheral and
mmap'ing /dev/mem is not a good way to go.  Fingers crossed that this
driver at least serves to help educate until the SMX hardware is
released and it can serve it's main purpose :-)

On the hardware we have there is no possibility that the interrupt is
shared.  That said, it's little effort to allow the sharing and makes
the whole thing more future-proof, changed.

Ah yep, thanks.
Thanks for the review, shall send a rejigged patch presently.
