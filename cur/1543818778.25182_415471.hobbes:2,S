Sorry, I've gone through but, ...
So far, the driver has been working on various x86_64 platforms (both AMD64 and EM64T with more than 4 GB mem.). Is this first time x86_64 kernel on those platforms or, the systems have been running on previous x86_64 kernels?
If you send me console log file, I'll look into it. But, still the issue need to be handled by SE team for further investigation.
I've submitted a patch that addresses one problem in 'megaraid_reset_handler()', but I don't think the fix connected to your issue directly.
Thank you,
Seokmann
