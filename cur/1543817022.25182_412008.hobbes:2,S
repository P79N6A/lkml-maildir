Greetings all,
Core-iSCSI v1.6.2.5 and Core-iSCSI-tools v3.3 are now available from:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/nab/iscsi-initiator-core/core-iscsi-v1.6.2.5.tar.bz2
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/storage/iscsi/core-iscsi-tools-v3.3.tar.bz2
The changes a relatively minor relating to a fix for core-iscsi on ARM
(namely the Nokia 770), as well as some fixes related to using the
core-iscsi-tools scripts in a busybox environment.  v3.3 of the tools
should also fix the authentication problem that appeared with v1.6.2.5
of the stack.
On a related note, the wiki on 
http://www.linux-iscsi.org
 has been
filling in nicely, and I would like to thank everyone that has
contributed.  linux-iscsi.org will continue to move forward the
evolution of Linux/iSCSI on all platfroms along with the Open/iSCSI and
IET development communities.
Thanks!
