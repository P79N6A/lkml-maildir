Nope.
Historically it depended whether you had a PATA controller with SATA
bridge, a SATA controller with SATA drives, a PATA controller with PATA
drives or a SATA controller with PATA bridge.
Often the bridges are on the card or mainboard. So some VIA systems would
historically use /dev/hda for the first SATA device.
Even more fun is stuff like Jmicron where the BIOS settings determined
whether PATA or SATA was /dev/hda
