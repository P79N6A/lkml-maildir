OH COME FREAKING ON!!!!  Can you guys DROP it already?  There was NO  
VIOLATION because nobody actually changed the code!!!  The patch that  
Jesper submitted was a *MISTAKE* and was *NEVER* *MERGED*!!!  Nobody  
needs to argue/flame/spam about anything because there is no change  
in the code.
My god this has been said 30 times by 30 different people at this  
point.  I swear it feels like talking to a wall.

CONCLUSION:
You guys are spamming our mailing list for NO GOOD REASON!!!!  Can we
