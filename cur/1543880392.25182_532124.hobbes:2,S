I don't think it's completely fair [sic] to come down on it that hard.
It does largely achieve the sort of fairness it set out for itself as
its design goal. One should also note that the queueing mechanism is
more than flexible enough to handle prioritization by a number of
different methods, and the large precision of its priorities is useful
there. So a rather broad variety of policies can be implemented by
changing the ->fair_key calculations.
In some respects, the vast priority space and very high clock precision
are two of its most crucial advantages.

The name chosen was somewhat buzzwordy. I'd have named it something more
descriptive of the algorithm, though what's implemented in the current
dynamic priority (i.e. ->fair_key) calculations are somewhat difficult
to precisely categorize.
