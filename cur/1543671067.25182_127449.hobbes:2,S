We should be doing this _anyway_.
With open hardware designs, there would be no problem with
documentation not being available to write drivers.
With open hardware designed by Linux developers, we could have
hardware _designed_ for Linux.
Incidently, using the Transmeta CPUs, is it not possible for the user
to replace the controlling software with their own code?  I.E. not
bother with X86 compatibility at all, but effectively design your own
CPU?  Couldn't we make the first Lin-PU this way?
John.
