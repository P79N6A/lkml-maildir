Sorry, I misquoted -- the no was to the change in the code's if condition 
from >= 0 to <= 0.  As for wake_up versus a wake one, it is desirable to
wake up only one process.  As to whether that process is a reader or a
writer is another question that in some cases should be decided by the
scheduler.

It also prevents a race condition whereby the lock is left unlocked with
all contenders sleeping.  See below.

Half.  rwsem_wake_readers has to wake all readers plus a writer -- this is
right.  But, the way the down_read_failed case is currently precludes
waking only one process right now because it means that not all readers
will be woken if the lock is completely unlocked before a reader comes
along to bias the lock.  This is because the code only does a wake_up on
the state transitions involving a change to or from the biased state (the
locks only have 3 states: unlocked, locked and biased).
