Yes.
Allocating everything and just requesting the irqs you really want is
works as well.  So drivers like that would need to be common and the
savings significant before it would really be worthwhile to change
the API back the way it is now.

Agreed.

Sure.   But if we can kill msix_entry in the same time frame it would
be a good thing.
