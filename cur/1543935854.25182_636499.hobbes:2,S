No, it doesn't. The msync() system call called with the MS_ASYNC flag
should (the POSIX standard requires that) update the st_ctime and
st_mtime stamps in the same manner as for the MS_SYNC flag. However,
the current implementation of msync() doesn't call the do_fsync()
function for the MS_ASYNC case. The msync() function may be called
with the MS_ASYNC flag before "natural syncing".
