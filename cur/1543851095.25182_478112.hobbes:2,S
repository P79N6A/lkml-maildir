The discussion fizzled out without really reaching a definitive
answer, so I'm going to apply the original patch (below), since I
pretty much convinced myself that only the driver doing the config
access has enough information to fix this reliably.

    IB/mthca: Make sure all PCI config writes reach device before doing MMIO
    During initialization, mthca writes some PCI config space registers
    and then does an MMIO read from one of the BARs it just enabled.  This
    MMIO read sometimes failed and caused a crash on SGI Altix machines,
    because the PCI-X host bridge (legitimately, according to the PCI
    spec) allowed the MMIO read to start before the config write completed.
    To fix this, add a config read after all config writes to make sure
    they are all done before starting the MMIO read.
