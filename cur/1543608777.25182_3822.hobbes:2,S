Could you send me an oops?
I assume that a
	set_current(hard_get_current());
is missing somewhere.
The assumption is that get_current() is faster than hard_get_current(),
and that there are so many get_current() calls that the overhead for the
set_current() in __switch_to and do_page_fault is small.

I would be very surprised if that's a problem: the error handlers are C
functions, and they don't expect parameters in register %ebx.
