I just came back from vacation. The non linear growth of regression
indicates lock contention somewhere. Must be something special that was 
triggered by hackbench.
We have had a regression like that in 2.6.24 before due to order 1 allocs 
in the network layer. The .24 modifications for SLUB introduced page 
allocator pass through for allocations > PAGESIZE/2. Order 1 allocs could 
serialize on zone locks.
