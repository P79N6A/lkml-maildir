I think it really needs to be maintained alongside the block device/buffer
cache/page cache layers, as it's a pretty special case. Allocating resources
from a device's do_request function is always going to be fragile, because
of the number of places where we start I/O to free things (buffer memory,
buffer heads, requests..).
