Indeed, thank you Steve! I had not noticed this progression from the
changelog messages. I've since verified on a multimillion file share that
cifs indeed shrinks the cifs_inode_cache under memory pressure. I've turned
on updatedb again, hope that the box survives it now.

I've since moved some stuff back to cifs to see what happens. I'll try to
convince some other people so they can share/report their problems properly.

That may be so but the definite perception is that cifs is unstable compared
to smbfs. Then again, this may have been related to out of memory conditions
which generaly tend to make things suck.
Thanks for your thoughtful reply, I'll see if I can provide useful feedback.
