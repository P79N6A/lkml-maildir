Do you mean "almost nothing"? It still allocates and adds a platform
device, and the corresponding function always gets called at boot time.
I know that not compiling this piece of code just reduces the
uncompressed kernel size by just a few bytes (218). However, many small
contributions of this kind can have a significant impact on embedded
systems (or on boot media or on Linux based bootloaders).
As I said earlier, I'm starting to think that this trick should only be
used when CONFIG_EMBEDDED is set. In the non-embedded case, it's
probably not acceptable not to declare a platform device that is always
present in the system (while it's perfectly fine not to load the
corresponding driver).
Your comments and suggestions are more than welcome!
Michael.
