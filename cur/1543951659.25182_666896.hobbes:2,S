I assume this slipped in accidentally (though it would
eventually be needed for an x86 version of this patch).

This is a bit ugly ... I don't see how to make it better (but
I'm sure that akpm will say "You could just ...", and then
I'll wonder why I didn't think of that).

As the author you get to choose the license ... but there is
strong movement to make new exported symbols GPL only.
When I apply this patch and run it on my tiger, I see a slew
of
	ACPI: Invalid PBLK length [0]
messages on my console during boot and the see
	$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/slot
	-1
So I guess that the _SUN method isn't there on my machine.
