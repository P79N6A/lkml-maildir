While working on 1K/2K page tables for s390 I noticed room for
improvement in regard to some common mm code:
 - unnecessary tlb flushing in unmap_vmas
 - ptep_establish has fallen into disuse
 - ptep_test_and_clear_dirty / ptep_clear_flush_dirty are not used either
 - the definitions of mm_struct and vm_area_struct should be moved to
   mm_types.h
 - page_mkclean_one is giving false positives
