I'd say the full test (including anon_vma) is maybe slightly
faster on this test though maybe it isn't significant.
It is doing around 2.5% more minor faults, thought the profiles
say copy_page_range time is reduced as one would expect.
I think that if all else (ie. final performance) is equal, then
faulting is better than copying because the work is being
deferred until it is needed, and we dodge some pathological
cases like Ray's database taking 100s of ms to fork (we hope!)
However it will always depend on workload.
This is the condition I ended up with. Any good?
   if (!(vma->vm_flags & (VM_HUGETLB|VM_NONLINEAR|VM_RESERVED))) {
     if (vma->vm_flags & VM_MAYSHARE)
       return 0;
     if (vma->vm_file && !vma->anon_vma)
       return 0;
   }
