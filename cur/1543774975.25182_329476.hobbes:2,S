shouldn't be much of a problem if it's actually an _GPL export.

As discussed in a different subthread of the 2.6.13 merge plan we'd like to
move towards not having truncate_inode_pages in that place, because reiser4,
hugetlbfs and some other cluster filesystems don't like it either.
But that alone isn't going to help you a lot..

I don't think that's doable without a major rework of that area of code.
