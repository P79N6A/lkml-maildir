so _POSIX_THREADS_PER_THREAD_SIGNALS_1 is effectively true?
Is there some way to do SIGEV_THREAD?

I think yes. Perhaps it doesn't have to be the most efficient
threading API on Linux, but it should be reasonably efficient. There
are lots of developers/companies who build their software specifically
to POSIX API's, and I think there is a value add to having their
software run reasonably well (and reliably) on Linux. A case in point
is the blackdown group, who didn't so much have problems with
performance, but they did find that pthreads behavior was different
enough from standard POSIX that we had to wait years before there was
a stable native-threads capable version of blackdown-java on Linux.

It would be good to hear from some of the Pthreads guys on what
they've tried so far and what conclusions they've reached. It sounds
to me that Linus' requirements on what he'll except are eminently
reasonable (indeed, they seem like the only way to go). I have to
imagine there's a way to make this work.

I think so, so long as the pthreads solution is not prohibitively
slow. Keep in mind that a lot of people use POSIX threads to get
better performance than a process based model, so pthreads is only
useful to them if it's fairly efficient.

While this is a good point, there are disadvantages to this approach,
particularly with something as close to the system level as
threads. Having a portable way of dealing with Linux's divergences
from POSIX threads signals behavior is a non-trivial task, and there's
nothing your threading library can do to convince external processes
that all your threads have the same PID. So, so long as your
application doesn't need these kinds of things (and a lot of them
don't), so long as you're willing to invest the effort to learn the
specifics of each platforms thread library, and so long as your
application can live with a least common denominator implementation of
threads, you're ok.
Having a working POSIX threads means that people don't have to
implement their own (and potentially inefficient and buggy) thread
abstraction layer. This saves application developer time. So, as long
as this doesn't cost us kernel developer time (which I guess would
require that we live in a perfect world rather than the real one ;-),
it's a good thing to have.

I agree, with the caveats mentioned above.
