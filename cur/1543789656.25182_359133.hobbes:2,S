I've had great trouble understanding it too.
This mail was the most helpful, thanks.

I thought that the CPU never caches !present entries in the TLB?
Or is that true of i386 (and x86_64), but untrue of ia64?
Or do you have some new model or errata on some CPU where it's true?
Or, final ghastly possibility ;), am I simply altogether wrong?

When you say "purged", is that what we elsewhere call "flushed"
in relation to the TLB, or something else?

You seem to be saying that strictly, we ought to flush TLB even when we
make a page present where none was before, but that the likelihood of it
being needed is so low, and the overhead of TLB flush so high, and the
existing code almost everywhere recovering safely from this condition,
that the most effective thing to do is just fix up the hugetlb case.
Is that correct?

But not on i386 or x86_64.

Okay, I get that part of the puzzle.

But here you mention prefetching, and I think in another of these
explanations you mention that this only happens via speculative prefetch.
I thought prefetch was designed to have no such visible effects?
Same series of doubts as with !present entries in the TLB; but after
looking at the ia64 fault handler, that does seem to have stuff about
speculative loads, so I'm guessing i386 and x86_64 prefetch does not
cause faults (modulo errata), but ia64 does.

Testing against i_size is not good enough, but I'll explain that
in other mail against Andrew's latest version of the patch.
Once I started to understand this thread, I thought you were quite
wrong to be changing hugetlb fault handling, thought I'd find several
other places which would need fixing too e.g. kmap_atomic, remap_pfn_range.
But no, I've found no others.  Either miraculously, or by good design,
all the kernel misfaults should be seamlessly handled by the lazy vmalloc
path (on i386 anyway: I don't know what happens for ia64 there), and the
userspace misfaults by handle_pte_fault's pte_present check.  I think.
Even with Nick's PageReserved changes in -mm, where he might have chosen
to put a warning on VM_RESERVED higher in the fault path, it looks like
it needs no change for this issue.
