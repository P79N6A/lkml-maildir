Which is okay as long as it still fits in the kernel.  Remember that
lots of projects had to adjust so far despite the commerical aims of
their creators.

IT should, and in fact it actually is most of the part.  We can have
differnt operation vectors per object, but reiser4 is the only
filesystem in the tree not making use of that but provinding only a
single one and then dispatching internally.  Even XFS that carries
around and horrible internal dispatching layer as IRIX legacy gets
this right.

Umm, no.  In fact every filesystem does this.  There's not too many
objects with different namespace semantic: regular files and special
files vs directories vs symlinks basically, but as soon as you go to the
data patch you can have hundrets of different file_operations on a
single filesystems (for special files).
