Hi everyone, hope I don't disturb too much.
I'm developping a module which uses an entry in /proc (read-only)
Currently my (*read_proc) function just write a integer in my /proc entry  
and increments it. Here is the code:
static int number_read_procmem(char *buf, char **start, off_t offset, int 
count, int *eof, void *data)
{
        int len = 0;
        len = sprintf(buf, "%d\n", number_current++);
        *eof = 1;
        return len;
}
the function is registered in init_module with this:
create_proc_read_entry("number", 0, NULL, number_read_procmem, NULL);
Problem is:
when I 'cat /proc/number' multiple times, instead of getting
0
1
2
3
...
I get
0
2
4
6
...
I've searched the Net for an answer to this but in vain. I'm not sure I 
should post this to this list (and I'm very sorry if I indeed shouldn't have) 
but this list is my last hope :(
Please can you CC: me the answers to this post as I'm not on the list.
Then again, sorry if I'm intruding and thanks for any help.
Regards,
Laurent Sinitambirivoutin
