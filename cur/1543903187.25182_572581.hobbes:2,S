This is true.
Kind of makes me wonder if the right thing is to introduce an
"interface" 64-bit type, call it __iu64 (__is64) defined as:
typedef __u64 __attribute__((aligned(8))) __iu64;
typedef __s64 __attribute__((aligned(8))) __is64;
... and encourage people to use it when creating new interfaces.
Don't know if that would do any good.
