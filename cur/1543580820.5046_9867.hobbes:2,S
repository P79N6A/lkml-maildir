Rule 1.  Applications must not include include kernel headers directly.
Rule 2. Any glibc that has a symlink from /usr/include/{linux,asm} to
/usr/src/linux/include/{linux,asm} is wrong.
Relying on /usr/include/{linux,asm} always pointing at the current
kernel source is broken as designed.  /usr/include/{linux,asm} must be
real directories that are shipped as part of glibc, not symlinks to
some random version of the kernel.  Fix /usr/include.
