The preempt-kernel patch does keep track of the lock count, but it does
not include semaphores and those are what we need to worry about.
I also don't think it is enough that SCHED_IDLE only be settable by
root.  Regardless of what permissions it takes to set the scheduling
class, a "SCHED_IDLE" task should never be capable of harming an RT
task.
One solution I have come across is checking whether the task is
returning to kernel or user mode and acting appropriately.  As needed,
the task can be scheduled as SCHED_NORMAL.  This situation could even be
special-cased like ptrace and not impact normal scheduling.  Perhaps
this is what Ingo had in mind ... I hope he is still interested and
presents some code.
I know all this because I tried to implement SCHED_IDLE about a year
ago.  There were arguments against every approach, and SCHED_IDLE will
never be accepted until they are all satisfied.  If we want it, it needs
to be done right.
