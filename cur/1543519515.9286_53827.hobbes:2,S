Sure, but this patch was done against 2.3.33 which will not run on SPARC
anyway.
That change is done in vger CVS, which is at the moment at 2.3.29.
BTW: Can you add #undef RLIM_INFINITY into bits/resource.h in your patch?
The above patch is just needed so that folks don't have to upgrade glibc
just because they installed a newer kernel.
Cheers,
