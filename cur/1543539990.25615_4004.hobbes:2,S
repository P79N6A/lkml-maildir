Hi Mikael,
You write:
    C. Change the Linux kernel to work around this problem. We either:
       C1. forcibly remake modversions.h in each subdir's `fastdep', or
       C2. don't create modversions.h at all in the subdirs, but only
	   once in the toplevel Makefile after doing dep-files.
I prefer C2.  Both the existing code and C1 have races on modversions.h
in a parallel 'make dep'.  C2 fixes your problem and fixes that problem
as well.
