I might not look for the right thing, but there are only two places
where register_gifconf is used: in net/ipv4/devinet.c and
net/decnet/dn_dev.c.  There is no support for IPv6-only interfaces and
interfaces for other protocols.  So in addition to your change only the
DECnet stuff needs changing.

I'll try the patch asap.  Thanks,
