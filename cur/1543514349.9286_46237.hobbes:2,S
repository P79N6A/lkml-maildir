Instead of trying to verify that the kernel module is what you
expected, check that the module loader's checksumming is correct
(/sbin/modprobe).
You will either have to statically link the loader or check the
libraries and ELF interpreter too. Once the kernel knows it is running
the genuine module loader, it can give it the extra capabilities it
needs to install modules; /sbin/modprobe can then implement your
security policy. The module loader is in a much better position than
the kernel to check module signatures, which is an approach I'd much
prefer to simple checksumming.
Obviously, you will need to stop the module loader from being tampered
with once it has started running. You will need to prevent the use of
ptrace to gain privilege (even for root), and since binaries are
demand page loaded, you will need to prevent the image on disk from
being altered. Also, setuid 'root' programs will need to be given less
than the full set of capabilities, but that's required for other
reasons anyway (eg. protection of immutible files).
