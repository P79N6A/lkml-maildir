Hija,
is anyone currently working on the UFS filesystem. I'd be really
interested in getting a stable support for read/write on OS X native
partitions; the current code is more than flaky in this regard in
the sense that it doesn't work at all:
- It allocates space for not written data
- It writes empty files into the directory
- It claims to be read-only after filecreation but still the above
  mentioned items apply.
