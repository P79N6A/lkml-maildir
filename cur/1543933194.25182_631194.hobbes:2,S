Well, in that case even if you moved them to the upper level, then they would 
still be in the same menu, if that's what you mean.

You mean:
 		[ ] Host side USB
 		[ ] Peripheral side USB
Right?
All this does is loose the USB menu, which was used to group them and to 
un-clutter the Device Drivers menu.  Note:  They would still be sharing the 
same menu, only this time it's the Device Drivers menu.
I guess it's a judgment call.  Let's see what others think.
