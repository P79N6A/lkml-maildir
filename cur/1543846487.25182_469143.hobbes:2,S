Ivan makes a good point here. I understand that pragmatism is king in this 
community but it would be a mistake to forget that there are lots of happy 
users out there that care about the idealism too. And it would be a 
mistake to offend those users just to make good on your personal vendetta 
against Richard Stallman.
Thanks,
