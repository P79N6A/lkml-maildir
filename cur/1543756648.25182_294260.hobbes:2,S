What if a second thread does a fork() while the rawio is in progress?
The page will be again no shareable, and if you unmap it the rawio will
be currupt if the thread that executed the fork while the I/O is in
progress writes to a part of the page again after it has been unmapped
(obviously the part of the page that isn't under read-rawio, rawio works
with the hardblocksize, not on the whole page).
