Yes.
At server thread creation, you need to be able to
   kmalloc(NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE+1024)
(or close to that) once per thread.  On most architectures this is a
high-order alloc_pages and can often fail.
Also, on every UDP write request, the server needs to 'kmalloc' a buffer
to hold the whole request (actually on every request that is
fragmented, but write is most common).  On most architectures, this
kmalloc will again require allocative several contiguous pages, which
can fail.
So this patch is only safe if you have a large-patch arch or only use
NFS over TCP.
There was once a patch floating around which allowed a larger
NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE on architectures with large page sizes, but it never
got properly submitted I think.

There must be some other cause.  Increasing the NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE is
just hiding a real problem I suspect.
