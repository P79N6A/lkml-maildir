Version 1.07 (included in 2.2.11) of the rtl8139 driver is _evil_. 
Granted, older versions are far worse (if you generated > 95 Mbit of trafic,
your machine would lock up). I use version 1.08a, and it works reasonably;
this excludes the occusasional:
eth0: Oh Oh, simulatinous entry of interrupt handler
message.
Could you try to upgrade to v1.08a and see if the memleaks go away?
(v1.08 is available from Donalds site)
