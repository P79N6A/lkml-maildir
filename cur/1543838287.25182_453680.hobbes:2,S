BTW, polling battery status takes a lot on a Dell Inspiron 8200 too,
and all keypresses and mouse movements (and I think even network
IRQs?) are totally *dead* while polling.
However, The Other OS(tm) *seems* to do it right enough to have no
noticeable keypress losses, even when updating the battery status. Is
it using different system calls, or what?
