You could link to the latest version in Linus' git repository:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;h=2a7e338ec2fc6aac461a11fe8049799e65639166;hb=1604d9c8f8dffafe3a077dc5ae7c935d2318bcf6;f=COPYING
That's a link to a specific revision, though, and I'm not sure if you
can just link to the latest version of the file. Somebody else with
more experience regarding git's web front-end may be able to tell you
more.
