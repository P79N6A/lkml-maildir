FWIW, I really think that this sort of bugs ("oh, I call hotplug,
rootfs is there but kernel is not ready, woe is me") clearly show
that many, _many_ users of hotplug are BS.  The reason is simple -
if we have a call of hotplug that early, we have a driver that lives
with hotplug failures _and_ with different behaviour in built-in
and modular cases.  I would argue that any such driver is broken.
