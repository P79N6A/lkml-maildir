There shouldn't be anything all that interesting in the i386 code apart
from accommodations made for slab.c and pageattr.c. But yes, I can do
the grunt work there since I'm familiar enough with its history.
I used the i386 pagetable caching backout code to help verify that
nothing unusual was going on with generic code in this area. I can
debug the altered quicklist code in like fashion to what that was.
Basically, I'll help all this along.
