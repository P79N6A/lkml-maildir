yeah. And this is not a pipe dream and i think it does not need a 
'wakeup matrix' or other complexities.
I am --->.<---- this close to being able to do this very robustly under 
CFS via simple rules of economy and trade: there the p->wait_runtime 
metric is intentionally a "physical resource" of "hard-earned right to 
execute on the CPU, by having waited on it" the sum of which is bound 
for the whole system.
So while with other, heuristic approaches we always had the problem of 
creating a "hyper-inflation" of an uneconomic virtual currency that 
could be freely printed by certain tasks, in CFS the economy of this is 
strict and the finegrained plus/minus balance is strictly managed by a 
conservative and independent central bank.
So we can actually let tasks "trade" in these very physical units of 
"right to execute on the CPU". A task giving it to another task means 
that this task _already gave up CPU time in the past_. So it's the 
robust equivalent of an economy's "money earned" concept, and this 
"money"'s distribution (and redistribution) is totally fair and totally 
balanced and is not prone to "inflation".
The "give scheduler money" transaction can be both an "implicit 
transaction" (for example when writing to UNIX domain sockets or 
blocking on a pipe, etc.), or it could be an "explicit transaction": 
sched_yield_to(). This latter i've already implemented for CFS, but it's 
much less useful than the really significant implicit ones, the ones 
which will help X.
