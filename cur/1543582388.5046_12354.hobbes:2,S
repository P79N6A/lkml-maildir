Yesterday I got an oops in a Dell PowerEdge 4100/200.
It was almost idle (the process list is listed below).
There was no SysRQ, VT, hd work, network or keyboard response.
The oops was, obviously, copied by hand; and kernel is
plain 2.4.1 compiled with egcs 2.91.66.
uname -a:
Linux sol 2.4.1 #3 SMP Wed Feb 14 18:14:33 ARST 2001 i686 unknown
Hardware:
2xiPPro 200mhz
128Mb ram
Intel eepro100
(dmesg attached)
process list:
syslogd
klogd 
httpd 
 \_ 5x httpd
crond
atd
bash 
 \_ mailsnarf 
bash
agetty
agetty
agetty
bash
 \_ vmstat 1
inetd
Attached are the plain oops, the oops passed through ksymoops, the dmesg
output and the kernel config.
Thanks,
        Alberto
