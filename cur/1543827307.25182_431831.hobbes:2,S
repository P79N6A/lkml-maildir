There is no such userspace caller yet.
Note, the task of nodemgr, or of a hypothetical userspace replacement, 
is not only to scan the ROMs of nodes and initiate attachment of 
protocol drivers but also
  - to rescan the ROMs of nodes after bus resets (necessary for protocol
    drivers to reconnect, which has restrictions WRT latency),
  - IEEE 1394 bus management (which has hard latency restrictions too).
We also started using nodemgr to determine the correct speed at which 
IEEE 1394b nodes can be reached, i.e. for fairly low-level tasks. And 
there are further plans for nodemgr like optimization of bus arbitration 
gaps, or parallelized node scanning.
I am not sure that this can really be loaded off to userspace. And if we 
would do so, deployment would become painful.
