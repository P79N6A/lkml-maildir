Yes. But that doesn't mean that the "preempt_count()" macro necessarily
needs to reflect that.
In particular, we have separate macros for getting the irq bits from that
shared word ("irq_count()" etc). Right now they happen to use the
"preempt_count()" macro, but that's not really fundamental.
No big deal either way, I suspect.
