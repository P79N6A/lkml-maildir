Hi all,
I'm having some problems using a Nokia 6131 in 'Data Storage' mode, i.e. 
when it acts as a USB mass storage device. This is with a Gentoo patched 
kernel 2.6.18, but AFAICT there are no patches against the USB subsystem 
in Gentoo's version of the kernel.
The symptoms: The system scans the partitions fine, I can mount the 
device and see the directory contents fine, but when I try to actually 
transfer files the USB subsystem seems to be doing bus resets 
continually until either of the sides simply gives up; I think it may be 
the phone that simply goes out of data storage mode into normal mode 
after a number of resets (or a fixed amount of time with no data transfer).
I've done a run with all the above steps with USB mass storage verbose 
debug enabled, the log can be retrieved from here:
    
http://imada.sdu.dk/~bardur/usb-storage.log.gz
The thing I that my untrained eye noticed was that most of the small 
transfers seem to succeed (at least before the bus resets kick in), 
while all the large transfers fail. This of course explains why reading 
the partition table and directory contents works.
Here's the phone's lsusb -v data:

(I should note that the product ID changes to 0x47b when the phone is 
NOT in data storage mode just in case it matters.)
Does anyone have any clues to impart or anything I can try to make it work?
