Unlikely, it's got to lock the entire kernel to make sure that things aren't
changing under it. Getting measurements is useful at this stage, but don't expect
it to be a finished product any time soon and please keep that in mind. Stability
should be, if it's not already, the single most important things in this project
at this phase. Getting numbers now for a specific single application is going to
be of limit use until the system is stable enough for general characterization.
Keep doing it, but keep in mind that anything you're going to get at this time
is going to be very coarse. Don't put too much weight on it.
That's my take.
