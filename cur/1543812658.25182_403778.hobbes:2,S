My plan is to queue all of this stuff for merging in 2.6.17.
Is there any objection from netdev or openib-general people?
I just looked back, and the original "unexport ip_dev_find()" patch
was a de-Bunk-ing change.  Now that there is a modular user, is there
any problem with re-exporting it?
Thanks,
  Roland
