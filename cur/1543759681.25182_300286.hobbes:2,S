The unit on this graph is kilobytes. So 80000 there means 80 megabytes per second.

It should not matter. Low-memory is both just 1 GB if you have default 32 bit with 3/1 split.

Its a full-duplex. Its a download-service with 3000 downloaders all over the world.

No. It ranges from 3 kb/sec to 100 kb/sec. 100 kb/sec is the limit because of the send-buffer limits.

1000 MBit

Yes. send-buffer to 64 kbytes and receive buffer to 16 kbytes.

I am using sendfile-call every 100 ms per socket with the poll-api. So basically around 40 kb per round.

3000 different downloaders, 3000 different locations, 3000 different machines ;)

Yes.
