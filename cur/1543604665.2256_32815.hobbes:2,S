    I would suspect that it is actually looping inside the kernel, which
    would mean that there indeed was no way to kill it.  You could try
    alt-scrolllock on the console and see if you get a register dump of
    it, or maybe one of the alt-sysrq magic keys might give you some
    information.  But I suspect that rebooting is ultimately going to be
    your only solution.
    
You might find out if it's looping inside the kernel by doing strace -p
<pid>, if you're stuck in a syscall, I *belive* strace'll tell you.
You wouldn't by any chance be developing a kernel module??
    Paul.
