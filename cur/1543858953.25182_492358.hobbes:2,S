One of the touted benefits of Linux is that we run on old hardware.
Unless the driver is demonstrably wrong (and they do become so as the
APIs evolve) or it fails to compile because of bitrotting, there's no
real urgency to remove it, is there?
The reverse (how do you know if someone's still using the driver) is
equally hard to determine.
