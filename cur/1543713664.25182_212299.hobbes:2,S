Hi,
In a previous post, you clear me that Documentation logo is only used for 
documentation purposes. I think that it were more better if logo.gif have a 
non-patented (and non-expired in some countries) extension.
So, I transformed the logo.gif to logo.png for that the second can substitute 
the first in the next versions of kernel. Because png extension is more free 
(the page 
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngfaq.html#patents
 desconcerned me 
about if it's totally free)
Xan.
