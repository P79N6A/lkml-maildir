We have this code in arch/alpha/kernel/pci.c for ages:
...
static void __init
quirk_eisa_bridge(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
	dev->class = PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_EISA << 8;
}
...
struct pci_fixup pcibios_fixups[] __initdata = {
	{ PCI_FIXUP_HEADER, PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82375,
	  quirk_eisa_bridge },
...
I think it belongs in drivers/pci/quirks.c.

Actually I thought of replacing "i82375" with "pci_eisa" everywhere
in your driver and
static struct pci_device_id pci_eisa_pci_tbl[] = {
	{ PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID,
	  PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_EISA << 8, 0xffff00, 0 },
	{ 0, }
};
Ivan.
