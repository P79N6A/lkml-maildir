Well, re-reading his post, he has a point - one WOULD expect each of these 2 
tasks to have an equal share of CPU, and if RSDL doesn't currently take this 
pipe-thing into account, it might need some fixing. call it heuristics or not 
(after all, how could one NOT say a scheduler uses heuristics of some kind?).
Anyway, relax (you know getting angry won't help you getting better) and 
remember this is email - not exactly a perfet way to communicate, esp in the 
emotional area. I haven't said this anywhere else, as I'm waiting for RSDL to 
be a bit more mature, but I have irritations with it as well - I don't have 
the long full-system stalls I had with staircase (hail RSDL!) but I do have 
more frequent, shorter stalls, when one app doesn't respond for up to 10 
seconds, while others just continue to work. So it's not perfect yet, and 
when I have time, I'll try to find out what's wrong. BTW, nice seems to help, 
but not entirely.
