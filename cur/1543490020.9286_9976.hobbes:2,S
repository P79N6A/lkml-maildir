It's strange for __you__. And you are the one that complains about failed
process allocation due VM fragmentation. If you have 2gigabyte of memory
you _won't_ care about 4mbyte of static memory wasted. I __never__
suggested this as a `default' approch (and I am _sure_ not going to do
that here), but I thought at that as a possible _trivial_ and _final_
solution for very-high memory machines.
In the meantime please try to cause the kernel to printk the "failed
allocation due VM fragmentation" message with my last patch applyed. You
started to complain without ever know which is your problem. Once you'll
find a way to log such message in your logs, please let me know how to
reproduce and I'll start to think about that.
