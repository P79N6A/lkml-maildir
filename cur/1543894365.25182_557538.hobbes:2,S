It's not a straw man.  See, I was just showing that there's precedent
to ensuring that other tricks can't be used to deny users the freedoms
that the GPL is meant to defend.
By pointing out this is in the GPLv2, you acknowledge the point I
wanted to make.
So what is it that makes hardware so different that it can be used as
a trick to deny users freedoms, if other tricks can't?

That's the different between legal terms and the spirit.  And the
promise of the GPL is to retain the spirit, to defend the freedoms.

I'm not sure I agree with the reasoning here, but I'm already
convinced that the argument about modification by replacement won't
fly.
But then again I ask you: why do you think TiVO is making these
hardware locks?  What do they want to cause or stop?
