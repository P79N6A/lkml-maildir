Hmm, that should not happen. Normally the problems fixed by 
this are expected to be very rare and you also should not get 
sync flood, but just cache line corruption. While it might be possible
for random corruption to then cause sync flood that should be again
rather unlikely. If it's repeatable quickly something else
must be wrong.

That only applies to sequential prefetch. But speculative execution can
 prefetch pretty much any address. That is why the clear_kernel_mapping is 
needed.
