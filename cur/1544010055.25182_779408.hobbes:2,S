Subject: [PATCH 2/2] tracing/fastboot: include missing headers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/11/114

For now include/trace/boot.h doesn't need to include necessary headers
for its functions and structures because the files that include it already
do it.
But boot.h could be needed as well for further uses on other files.
So, this patch adds the necessary headers for future purposes...
