Thanks, I tried that but to no avail :(
To expand on the problem :
I have a creative DVD 5x drive and some unbranded CD-RW drive. The 
problem occurs on both when I try to rip audio.
I know for a fact they both have the capability to rip audio nicely, I 
have seen them do it under a 2.2.X kernel, but now I'm running 2.4.18 (I 
need 2.4 for my nvidia card)
However, hdparm returns this (on both drives, no matter what 
slave/master dma/irq combo I use)...
 HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Invalid argument
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 HDIO_GET_NOWERR failed: Invalid argument
 readonly     =  1 (on)
 readahead    =  0 (off)
 HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument
 busstate     =  1 (on)
 HDIO_GET_ACOUSTIC failed: Invalid argument
See the worrying "HDIO_GET_ACOUSTIC failed: Invalid argument" ?
I'm not sure who is maintaining that part of the kernel though.
Thanks for any help,
mikeH
