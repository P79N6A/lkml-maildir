	Configfs is designed for ascii or readable attributes.  It drops
the bin_attribute type that sysfs still supports.  So if you are looking
to fill a 64K binary attribute, configfs isn't the place you're going to
be going.

	Check out nfsctl.c and its transaction_file design.  process A
and process B get different buffers on filp->f_private, and cannot
influence each other's read/write operations.
