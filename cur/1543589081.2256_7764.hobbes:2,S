This seems to be the problem reported about a year ago, but never fixed.
It exists, even in early kernels.
mke2fs /dev/fd0
mount /dev/fd0 /mnt
cp stuff /mnt
lilo -C - <<EOF
boot = /dev/fd0
map  = /mnt/map
backup = /dev/null
install=/mnt/boot.b
image=/mnt/vmlinuz
initrd=/mnt/initrd
root=/dev/ram0
EOF
umount /dev/fd0
cp /dev/fd0  raw.bin
The disk image, raw.bin, does NOT contain the image of the floppy.
Most of boot stuff added by lilo is missing. It will eventually
get there, but it's not there now, even though the floppy was
un-mounted!
A work-around was to do:
	ioctl(fd, FDFLUSH, NULL);
... from a program  before copying the image.
Cheers,
