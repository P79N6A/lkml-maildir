<looks in MAINTAINERS. Shifts blame.>
In fact scsi is the area in which I have the most who-maintains-what
trouble.  I just don't believe what MAINTAINERS says about scsi drivers and
I tend to resort to git-whatchanged to find out who's really doing stuff. 
The number of people@lsil.com makes my head spin and I tend to cc as many
as I can get my hands on.
IOW: some care and attention to the ./MAINTAINERS file would really help
here.
