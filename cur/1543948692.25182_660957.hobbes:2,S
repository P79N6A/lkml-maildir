it was requested to be unified to 32 bit as well already - no patch yet. 
I'd gladly take a patch that does it - it fixing 32-bit Xen guests would 
be an added bonus. Perhaps this all should be done by injecting a very 
eary e820 filter instead of reserving it later on? 640k..1M being 
special is a deep PC legacy, i doubt we'll ever recover from it ;-)
