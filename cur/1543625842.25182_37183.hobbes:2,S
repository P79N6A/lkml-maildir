While I was attempting to debug a little bit, I installed tcpdump to see 
if it was even seeing the router advertisements...Apparently it was..
On top of that, if you keep tcpdump running, IPv6 works fine!
I noticed that when I had it manually configured, whenever any sort of 
routing was necessary, a neighbor solicitation was sent out, but never 
made it to the other end. However, if I let it auto configure, it worked 
fine, and as well if I added on the secondary addresss using "ifconfig 
eth1 add ....", so, with that being said, is it a MAC or IP address 
filtering problem?
Any ideas would be appreciated, I'd like to get this running, as I'm a 
big fan of IPv6... I have 1 IPv4 address, but a whole /48 to work with. :-D
Thanks again,
