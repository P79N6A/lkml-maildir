Subject: [PATCH 08/24] psmouse: dont leave mouse asleep
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It looks like quite a few mice out there treat PSMOUSE_RESET_DIS
as a powerdown request and turn off the light rendering the mouse
unusable.
Vojtech recommended to switch from PSMOUSE_RESET_DIS to full reset,
however we don't want to do that everywhere as full reset is pretty
slow. Instead we only use it before probing for "generic" protocols,
such as IntelliMouse and Explorer, to make sure that the mouse will
be woken up if it went to sleep as a result of PSMOUSE_RESET_DIS
issued earlier.
