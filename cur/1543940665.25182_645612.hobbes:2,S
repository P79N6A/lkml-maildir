I cannot speak for Wolfgang but I myself did not get extraordinary high
latencies running tests on system booted from flash. Neither I could produce
high latencies on nfs booted system. If my non-rt workload doesn't do heavy
filesystem/network accesses. i.E. running only hackbench. Hence we were
wondering if the problem is caused by rcu's in network layer or nfs
implementation.
