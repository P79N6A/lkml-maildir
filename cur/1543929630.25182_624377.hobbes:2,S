I finally got around to testing Linux 2.6.24 (2.6.24-rc4) and found
that the it87 driver fails to probe and consequently, my sensors no
longer work. This was fine with Linux 2.6.23.8 (the last kernel I was
using)
The necessary modules load, but:
it87: Found IT8718F chip at 0x290, revision 2
it87: in3 is VCC (+5V)
it87 it87.656: Failed to request region 0x290-0x297
it87: probe of it87.656 failed with error -16
Coretemp still works.
It appears it has something to do with the ioport range being
reserved for some reason:
system 00:01: ioport range 0x290-0x29f has been reserved
At least I don't see that happening on previous kernels.
In any case, the changes to it87.c itself don't appear to have caused
this. (CC'd hwmon maintainer anyways, my apologies if that was
inappropriate)
