As you say, the speed of lzf relative to gzip is impressive.
However if the properties of the kernel dump mean that it is not suitable for 
compression then surely it is not efficient to spend any time on it.

Are you sure? :-)
If we are talking about systems with 32GB of memory then we must be taking 
about organisations who can afford an extra 100GB of disk space just for 
keeping their kernel dump files. 
I would expect that speed of recovery would always be the primary concern.
Would you agree?
