Hi!
Sorry if this is OT.
I'm not sure if this is a kernel issue, but I'm running out of 
ideas on this....
I have a HP Omnibook XE3 with SuSE Linux 7.2 installed.
Everything works fine except suspend-to-disk.
(I have created the partition. It works under Winblows...)
I have tried Kernels 2.4.4 and 2.4.7 (with SuSE patches) as well as 
2.4.9 vanilla, but I keep getting the same messages:
When I do
	apm -s
I get 
	apm: Input/output error
and the Kernel log says:
apm: suspend: Unable to enter requested state
Any ideas what I could do?
TIA,
 Robert
