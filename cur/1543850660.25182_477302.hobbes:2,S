Hi,
    1) What is the synatx of call_usermodehelper()
function?
        I found out that it takes 4 arguments. But
what values  we have to pass as argumets.
I did searched in internet. But could not find out.
Sorry to post this question.
2) How to print something  using C code such that it
will be displayed when corresponding a.out file is
called in a kernel module using call_usermodehelper()
function.
Thanks in advance.
