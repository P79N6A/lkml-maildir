It's on metalab at
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/eql-1.2.tar.gz
The source will compile if you change the 
  #include "/usr/src/linux ...
line to
  #include <linux/if_eql.h>
and compile using:
  gcc -D__KERNEL__ eql_enslave.c -o eql_enslave
I'm in the process of updating the kernel docs -- school is keeping me
busy right now, but it will be done shortly.
