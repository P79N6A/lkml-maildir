I suggest that the current BK PULL methods be indirected.
Instead of "signed-off-by", how about an explicit email to the
author(s) and a pre-commit email list with required ACK(s) prior
to commit?  Email acks are perhaps a better chain of trust than
a signature line.
Use of BK has lost some of the "many-eyeballs" positives of the past.
Today's BkCommits-Head list only allows an after-the-fact review.
Frequently, the patch author and sometimes the maintainer are the
only parties to the change.  A pre-commit list could allow comments by
interested parties on patches that today are under reviewed.
