Subject: [PATCH] sysfs: Take sysfs_mutex when fetching the root inode.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

sysfs_get_inode ultimately calls sysfs_count_nlink when the a
directory inode is fectched.  sysfs_count_nlink needs to be
called under the sysfs_mutex to guard against the unlikely
but possible scenario that the root directory is changing
as we are counting the number entries in it, and just in
general to be consistent.
