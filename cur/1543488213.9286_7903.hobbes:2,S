If you are getting corruption several seconds after the  card is shut down
then I can't help. At that point the only person who can figure why a few
people still see corruption is someone with $15,000 of PCI bus analyser.
The driver is to spec, the fix I put in removed a real bug. I don't have
a system I can replicate the problem on. Feel free to try 10 seconds or
a week, whatever fixes your board, but there isnt anything I can do
