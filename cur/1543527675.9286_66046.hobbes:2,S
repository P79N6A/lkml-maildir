Exactly the same crash happenned again this morning - the EIP and code
were precisely the same - and other values I randomly compared also
matched.
Sorry I don't understand precisely how a "NULL pointer dereference" comes
about. Could some other code by jumping in error into the tcp_keepalive
code, which then is properly confused? Or does this point surely at
tcp_keepalive being bad in itself? I'm just wondering what's worth even
trying at this end - whether I should be worrying about the SCSI driver or
other seemingly unrelated things.
