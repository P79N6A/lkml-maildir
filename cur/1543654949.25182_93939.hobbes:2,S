Keep in mind that sometimes the actual _implementation_ is also highly
PCI-specific -- that is, what works for PCI devices may not work for
other devices and vice-versa.
So perhaps instead of just replacing `pci_...' with `dma_...', it would
be better to add new function pointers to `struct bus_type' for all this
stuff (or something like that).

How is the driver supposed to tell whether a given dma_addr_t value
represents consistent memory or not?  It seems like an (arch-specific)
`dma_addr_is_consistent' function is necessary, but I couldn't see one
in your patch.
Thanks,
