I don't believe anybody who relies on one simple test case will
ever be capable of evaluating a patch without breaking things.
Test cases can show problems, but fixing a test case is no
guarantee at all that your VM will behave ok with real world
workloads.  Test cases for the VM can *never* be relied on
to show that a problem went away.
I'll do my best, but I can't promise a simple test case
for every single problem that's plaguing the VM.
