I'm not sure I follow you here.  Compiling this code (gcc 2.96):
int foo1(void) { return sizeof(struct ext2_sb_info); }
int foo2(struct ext2_sb_info *sbi) { return sizeof(*sbi); }
yields:
00000b70 <foo1>:
      b70:       b8 dc 00 00 00          mov    $0xdc,%eax
      b75:       c3                      ret
00000b80 <foo2>:
      b80:       b8 dc 00 00 00          mov    $0xdc,%eax
      b85:       c3                      ret
The sizes are the same, so unless it makes a difference with another 
version of gcc then this is just a cosmetic change.
