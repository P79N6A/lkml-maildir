yes. sorry for forgetting to write it.

I don't expect it. But when I posted this before (as RFC), some persons
(Martin J. Bligh and Dave Hansen) had concerns about it.
I think the heaviest users of page_to_pfn() are the page allocator and
mk_pte(page_to_pfn(page), hogehoge).
So, tests like  "mmap -> touch all -> unmap" will be good test.
powerpc and ia64 is not a good test environment, because they don't use
page_to_pfn() of generic DISCONTIG definitions.
other NUMAs (i386, x86_64 etc..) will be good.
Thanks,
