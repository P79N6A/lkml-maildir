I was hoping someone would mention exactly this point.  I'm glad
I'm not alone with regards to what is and what is not "good" documentation.
From a practical standpoint, programmers often have to maintain code written 
by people who have since left the project/company.  In cases where the author 
is no longer available to answer questions, having documentation that explains 
why certain decisions were made makes code maintenance much easier and safer.  
If the routine is long or complex then perhaps even a brief outline of what 
is supposed to happen is helpful.
There is nothing worse than receiving a bug report and narrowing the problem
down to a chunk of code whose only comment is "This next bit of code is messy 
but it works."

I would go a step further and say that good documentation can also alert
people to problems that the author may have encountered or foreseen
that affected the final design.  Something like: "the obvious ways
of doing this are <stuff> or <stuff> but neither will always work
because of <reason>."  Again, this gets back to documenting the "whys"
and not necessarily the "whats".
