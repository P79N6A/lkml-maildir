We can hope, or try!  
I believe this sort of thing can be fixed even after feature freeze, after
all it is acknowledged as a bug, not a "missing" feature.

The "good" solution would be the better one.  According to Linus,
the bad latency is a bug, because something is using more time than
necessary.  Fixing that will be a win-only scenario, less time used
will improve all cases, both better audio latencies and even better
disk performance under cpu load.
Maybe it won't improve audio latency *enough*, in that case
insert some of the reschedule calls anyway.  But you won't need 
as many of them if the underlying bug is fixed.
