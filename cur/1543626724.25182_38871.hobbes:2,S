hey! i experience a weird IDT issue on kernels 2.4.x. what i want to do is
finding the address of a certain IDT gate but when i try to read memory
from ring0 at that location it segfaults. the code is in assembler.
.bss
idtr:
.double
.text
get_gate:
	movl	$0x80, %eax
	sidt	idtr
	movl	idtr+2, %ebx
	leal	(%ebx, %eax, 8), %ebx
	movw	(%ebx), %cx 	<- segfault
i cannot find out why is this happening.. i would apreciate any help that
i can get.
