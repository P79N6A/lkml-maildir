Hi Dan,
We use Exar ST16C654D chips on a cPCI 16-port mux we build and have not
(yet) had a problem report on it for this. Maybe I can reproduce the symptom
on this board. What vendor marking is on your UARTs? Could you tell me more
about your test setup and specifically how often data is dropped and how
many characters are dropped each time? What kind of device is receiving the
data and how much receive FIFO does it have left when it drops RTS to tell
the Blue Heat to stop? 
Best regards,
Ed
