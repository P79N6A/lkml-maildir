	Hi all,
I've been running 2.6.11-rc1 on my dual opteron Fedora Core 3 box for a week
now, and I think there is a memory leak somewhere. I am measuring the
size of active and inactive pages (from /proc/meminfo), and it seems
that the count of sum (active+inactive) pages is decreasing. Please
take look at the graphs at
http://www.linux.cz/stats/mrtg-rrd/vm_active.html
(especially the "monthly" graph) - I've booted 2.6.11-rc1 last Friday,
and since then the size of "inactive" pages is decreasing almost
constantly, while "active" is not increasing. The active+inactive
sum has been steady before, as you can see from both the monthly
and yearly graphs.
Now I am playing with 2.6.11-rc1-bk snapshots to see what happens.
I have been running 2.6.10-rc3 before. More info is available, please ask me.
The box runs 3ware 7506-8 controller with SW RAID-0, 1, and 5 volumes,
Tigon3 network card. The main load is FTP server, and there is also
a HTTP server and Qmail.
	Thanks,
-Yenya
