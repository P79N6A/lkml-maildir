Hi volks!
I just wanted to tell everybody that 2.5.62 works great for me on Alpha...
Thanks a lot to the alpha kernel developers!!! You did a great job...
OK now, why don't call the next kernel 2.6.0 and release it as soon as possible
:-))) The whole world is awaiting this moment. :-)
Best regards,
 Oliver
