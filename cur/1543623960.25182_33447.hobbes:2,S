I admit that I don't know the details of the x86 implementation,
but that sounds a little to large doesn't it?
I recently fixed the cris port to get 1 us resolution (by reading a
25MHz timer value within a jiffie).
My tests show that the time between calls to gettimeofday() typically
is 4-5 us on the 100MIPS ETRAX100LX - not that bad.
On my Linux PC i got 1us most of the time but never the same value,
but that is an old machine - PII 266 (reminds me I need to change machine:).
