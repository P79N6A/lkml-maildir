I would move this line
       if (p->flags & PF_VCPU) {
               account_guest_time(p, cputime);
------>                p->flags &= ~PF_VCPU;  <---------
               return;
       }
into kvm_guest_exit. Otherwise a guest that is running very long in 
guest context would only get the first tick accounted as guest time, no?
Besides that, this looks good and should work for kvm on s390 as well. 
Thanks Laurent.
