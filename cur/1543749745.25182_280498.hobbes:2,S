Hi.  Andi Kleene and you both ask why we're using the __cpu_to_be16
kind of byte-swappers.
I think it comes down to a semantics thing, and it's probably
controversial.  We are using fixed-size integers, so we specify the
size of the integers.  A short happens to be 16-bits wide on most
architectures, but it needn't be, esp. in the future, so it's more
clear to say what we mean.
