I opened the drive after BIOS didn't detect it on reboot (after
power-off).  There's one fired (burned? perished? how's that in
english?) chip on the plate, wich smells like fired silicone.
  It looks like a ~5mm pit in the center of square chip, full of
ache, and there's a crack across it.  The drive is dead.
I think it's a chip which controls one of the motors of the drive,
most probably the one which moves the head, because the head
motor connector is right near the chip.
When I turned off power, the drive was *hot*, and it started
"trembling" (or chattering) when I turned power off.
It was a dvd-cd combo (read dvd, read-write cd) Teac drive, I
don't remember the model (there's no label on the drive, and
I can't send inquiry/identify command to it anymore, obviously).
Yest it looks like a problem in the drive *too*, as it should
not behave like that in the first place.  But the thing is, I
did know something's bad going on, I saw it, but I wasn't able
to stop it from linux, only poweroff stopped things from going.
