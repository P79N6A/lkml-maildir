Please do not hit reply and change the subject when you really want to 
create a new message.  You apparently replied to to a message in the 
thread "ext2 on flash memory".  This causes your message to show up 
under that thread, which is confusing to people reading that thread, and 
will cause those ignoring that thread to never see your message.
