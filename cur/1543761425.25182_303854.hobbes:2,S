Oh no, not that page again ;)
Seems to say that prezeroing makes negligible difference to kernel builds,
but speeds up a big malloc+memset by 3x to 4x, yes?
Are there any real-worldish workloads which show an appreciable benefit?
The large speedup for a big memset seems odd - I assume it's simply
transferring CPU load from the user's process over to kscrubd.  Or is it
the fancy page-zeroing hardware?  How do we differentiate the two?
Are there any workloads which are seeing a benefit on a CPU which doesn't
have the zeroing hardware?
