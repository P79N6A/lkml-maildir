No.  There's much saner way to do that and it does not involve any gccisms
at all.  I'd posted such patches quite a while ago; normal C constructs
are quite sufficient, TYVM.
We don't _need_ that 'allow the old "unsigned long data"' junk.  There's
not enough users of setup_timer() to excuse it; other instances can and
should be converted to setup_timer() one by one, getting their types switched
to sanity as we go.
Let's not mix type safety with that ugliness, please.
