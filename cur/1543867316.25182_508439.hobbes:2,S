i think what you might be missing is that it's only the 6 syscall 
arguments that are fetched via indirect pointers - security checks are 
then done by the system calls themselves. It's a bit awkward to think 
about, but it is surprisingly clean in the assembly, and it simplified 
syslet programming too.

yeah, but 'small' is a dangerous word when it comes to adding IO 
interfaces ;-)

1024 (512 on 64-bit) is alot but not ALOT. It is also certainly not 
ALOOOOT :-) Really, people will want to have more than 512 
disks/spindles in the same box. I have used such a beast myself. For Tux 
workloads and benchmarks we had parallelism levels of millions of 
pending requests (!) on a single system - networking, socket limits, 
disk IO combined with thousands of clients do create such scenarios. I 
really think that such 'pinned pages' are a pretty natural fit for 
sys_mlock() and RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, and since the kernel side is careful to 
use the _inatomic() uaccess methods, it's safe (and fast) as well.
