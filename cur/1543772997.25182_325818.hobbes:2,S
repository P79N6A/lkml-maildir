IMA isn't an access control model.  Also, LSM is overkill for its needs
in many ways (IMA only needs a few LSM hooks) and is inadequate in other
ways (LSM lacks a hook needed by IMA for measuring modules, although one
might argue that there could be benefit in adding such a hook to LSM
itself for access control purposes).

If you look at the inotify patch, I think that they've moved the dnotify
hooks into a more generic set of fsnotify hooks that are leveraged by
both dnotify and inotify to reduce duplication in the core kernel.  The
same approach could be used for hooks that would be co-located by audit
and LSM or by integrity measurement and LSM.  Of course, you don't want
to blindly place the integrity measurement hooks at the same locations
if a different placement would be more optimal for your purposes, so
you'd want to give it some thought.
