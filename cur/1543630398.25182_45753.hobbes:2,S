I am having problems with building/resyncing RAID as well. Here's what I did
for my two RH 7.2 machines:
In /etc/sysconfig/ I created new file called hdparm.cfg with following
content
-d 0 /dev/hde
-d 0 /dev/hdg
-d 0 /dev/hdi
-d 0 /dev/hdk
In /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit right before root partition gets remounted r/w
(there may be a better spot for that, suggestions, anyone?) I added the
following:
# adjust hd parameters
if [ -e /etc/sysconfig/hdparm.cfg -a -x /sbin/hdparm ]; then
        action $"Adjusting hdparm:" /sbin/hdparm $(/bin/cat
/etc/sysconfig/hdparm.cfg)
fi
Crude, but works.
