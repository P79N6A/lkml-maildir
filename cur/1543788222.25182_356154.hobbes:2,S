They are namespaces which processes can join. Right now you can do
it by chrooting into /proc/{pid}/root, but this is, as Bodo said,
not a very sane API.
Without this, a user starting two sessions gets two namespaces,
which is profoundly counterintuitive from the user's POV.

Yes, but you can change them too (that's what e.g. mount() is for!)

I think that's the idea; a filesystem holding namespaces that you're
allowed to chroot() into.
