It handles vm migration, but not process migration.  The most compelling
thing (imo) which the latter allows you to do is live OS upgrade under
an application.  Xen won't let you do that.  Of course load-balancing is
also more fine-grained and powerful with process set migration, and
the overhead of a full OS per migrateable job is quite heavy.
That's not to say we don't also want to use Xen :) - it has it's own
advantages and I'm not intending to denigrate those.  We just hope to
get both!
