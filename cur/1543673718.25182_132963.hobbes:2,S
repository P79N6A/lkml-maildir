Yes, I'm also not very eager to make "core functionality" a config option. 
The confusion with the INPUT layer config options was mighty, and none of 
it pleasant. And the *BSD's have historically had totally stupid problems 
with programs like Wine etc requireing kernel recompiles just because they 
made code functionality like vm86 mode or LDT support be a config option.
I don't see the point in dropping futexes except perhaps in a very 
controlled embedded environment, but if that is the case, then a PC config 
should just force it to "y" and not even ask the user. 
We absolutely do NOT want the situation where a program will not work just 
because the user forgot some config option that mostly isn't needed.
And futexes _are_ going to be needed. Any sane high-performance threading 
implementation _will_ use them. No ifs, buts or maybe's.
