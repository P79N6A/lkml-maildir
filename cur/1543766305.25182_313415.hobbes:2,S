the shorter, the better IMO but i do not really care to be honest.
It should just express that this usually is no error, so "wrong
signature" and maybe "not valid image" may scare the users. "has no
suspend image" sounds 'mostly harmless', so it may be best.
All IMO, and i am no native english speaker, so some proofreading is
always a good idea :-)
