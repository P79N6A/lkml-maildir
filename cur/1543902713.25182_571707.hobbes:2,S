I think this is no longer the case, is it? With KVM updates already
merged in latest mainline -git, that modified smp_call_function_single()
behaviour ...

In any case, this is unsafe. smp_call_function_single() -- with the old
semantics, which is what this patch assumes, obviously -- is quite
pointless without its _caller_ disabling preemption around it. So the
put_cpu() must come after the smp_call_function_single, otherwise
you won't even detect the error that might happen, seeing you're
ignoring its return and this wrapper being void-returning.

... for the sake of API / behaviour consistency.
But probably you should just drop this ... with smp_call_function_single's
new semantics, I don't see this function growing any users.
