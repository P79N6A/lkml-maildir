Well, it turns out that maybe it is in fact untrue.  :-/
I need to look at all uses of PF_NOFREEZE -- as I understand the
code, processes marked PF_NOFREEZE will continue running, potentially
interfering with the hotplug operation.  :-(
I will pass my findings on to this list.

Hey, just ending the debates on how to do CPU-hotplug locking would be
worth something!  ;-)

:-(
But there can't be -that- many elements in that list...  But agreed,
separate issue.
							Thanx, Paul
