... and now that we've completed this step, the apt cache has suddenly
been reduced (see Gordon's mail for an explanation) and it segfaults:
sh-3.1# ls -l /var/cache/apt/
total 12524
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   12288 Dec 22 04:41 archives
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6426885 Dec 22 05:03 pkgcache.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6426835 Dec 22 05:03 srcpkgcache.bin
sh-3.1# apt-get -f install
Reading package lists... Done
Segmentation faulty tree... 50%
