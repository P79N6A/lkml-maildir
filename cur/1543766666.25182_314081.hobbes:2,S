Please stop the flaming.  You're adding the equivalent of "I've added
a suid shell, please make sure it can only affect the caller's files".
Do you really think we want to add such crap?
You're really falling into the Hans Reiser trap - if you just wanted to
add a simple userland filesystem you'd be done by now, but you're trying
to funnel new semantics in through it.  Which is by far not as easy as
adding a simple file system driver and needs a lot more though.
