To answer, the SCSI layer should tell you where it is.  In 2.5.x (in a few
more days, hopefully), devfs will tell you this.
As for queuecommand() trying to do something, this is all normal.  It's
showing you that it is properly throwing away things that don't make sense
for a USB device like this.  Turn off debugging if you don't like it.
