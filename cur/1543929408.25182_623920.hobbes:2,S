Yes, that is how it works.  Pretty confusing, so I figured I'd better
send in a patch to document it.
In the ip=::::::off case, the code in ip_auto_config() sees that
ic_enable is asserted but that ic_myaddr is NONE and proceeds to do
autoconfiguration.
I'd welcome comments from people on whether we should change how it
works instead of just document it.
