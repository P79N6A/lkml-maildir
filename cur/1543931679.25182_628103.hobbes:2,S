Thanks, Mel.  This is all with CONFIG_SLAB=y, by the way.
Note that it did appear to behave better with CONFIG_SLUB=y when I accidently
used that .config on my 4GB machine here.  Physical segments of 4-10 pages
happended much more common than with CONFIG_SLAB=y on my 3GB machine
Slightly "apples and oranges" there, I know, but at least both were x86-32.  :)
So I would expect CONFIG_SLAB to be well off with this patch under most (all?)
conditions, but dunno about CONFIG_SLUB.
Cheers
