That was me, but it wasn't this thread.  I was talking about building
glibc against the 2.5.x kernel headers, that caused problems.  glibc
2.3.2 with gcc 3.3 against the 2.4.20 headers is perfectly stable, and
passes all tests in "make check".  Even with "-O3 -march=athlon-xp
-mfpmath=sse", the only tests that fail are in the trig functions (SSE
on the Althon only has 32 bit precision so the values are truncated).
