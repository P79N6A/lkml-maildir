Well. Last time I looked they had something in the order of 512 entries
per MB of cache or so (ie 2MB of coverage per MB of cache). So it'll only 
cover it if you're using 2K of the data in each page (50%), but not if 
you're touching cachelines distributed widely over pages. with large 
pages, you cover 1000 times that much. Some apps may not be able to 
acheive a 50% locality of reference, just by their nature ... not sure 
that's bad programming for the big number crunching cases, or DB workloads 
with random access patterns to large data sets.
Of course, this doesn't just apply to HPC/database either. dcache walks
on large fileserver, etc. 
Even if we're talking data cache / icache misses, it gets even worse,
doesn't it? Several cacheline misses for pagetable walks per data cacheline
miss. Lots of the compute intensive stuff doesn't even come close to 
fitting in data cache by orders of magnitude.
