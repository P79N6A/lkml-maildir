Agreed.  I don't want my stuff going in without knowing it works.

This is what I'm curious about.  My personal guess is that there is a 
lot of ISDN hardware available, but not necessarily the telco ISDN 
availability.  But I have no way to gauge the Linux ISDN userbase size 
(beyond responses from isdn maintainers and list users), so I'm a poor 
judge.
