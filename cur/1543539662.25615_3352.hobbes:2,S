What sort of command did you think it was - telepathic toaster controls?
It's a kernel service. It's the kernel's problem if anything's wrong with
it.

Unfortunately, hardware cannot do this reasonably: that's the OSs job.

No: I do not allow the electrician to come in with a nuke. Destroying my
house with a screwdriver and a pair of pliers would be quite a challenge.

Exactly the point: I do NOT allow him to wire the bath taps up to the live
wire. He is allowed to replace a circuit breaker, or a broken light switch
or whatever, and that's ALL he is allowed to do. No nuclear weapons, no
plumbing tools, just access to the components he is permitted to service.
NOTHING should be permitted to get close to rewriting the firmware. If we
want a firmware rewrite facility, we'll provide one. If not, userspace
can't rewrite firmware.

No - you do not give that power to anyone, because it is never actually
needed.

At which point, there is NO legitimate use for raw IDE commands from
userspace.

If we are providing the correct API to userspace, and are given enough
information on the drive, there is no need for binary anything - just a
kernel firmware driver. Intel have supported this for their processors -
the HDD manufacturers will probably do the same.

Once the bypass option is removed, their program no longer works without
changes. I don't have the low-level info on how to write this interface,
only Andre does - and I think he's busy writing FreeBSD code now :-)
However, if and when I get the information and other resources to write
such support, I will do so.

Yes - so we need another solution for 2.4. Block off the suicide calls,
leave the necessary functions with a big "This is DANGEROUS and will be
REMOVED in 2.5.0" or similar.

The crappy interface will be completely replaced in 2.5.0 anyway, crap and
all.

"Guess" is the wrong word. However, yes, I know it selectively blocks out
SOME userspace IDE commands. I would prefer to block them all out, but
that's not practical now, so we'll have to settle for second best - block
what we can.

It can be done already using the framebuffer support, although that costs
you hardware acceleration access. Long term, X itself needs a major
overhaul anyway...

I never suggested it entailed "new OS design principles" - it's just a
matter of designing and coding a block to a dangerous API call, to serve
as a stop-gap until that API can be removed entirely.

It's a risk, yes. The current situation is complete shit, the proposed
stop-gap is pretty crap. Since you admit any more major improvement is
impossible, we should stick with "pretty crap" for the time being.

Andre's patch is far too big for what it is supposed to do. However, the
fundamental idea (block the API calls which shouldn't exist in the first
place) is fine.

No, MS just arms everyone to the teeth and hopes MAD will sort out any

If the sane replacement is actually needed, it will be written. Either
updating HDD firmware IS needed, in which case the support will be done,
or it isn't, in which case we leave a simple block in place. Neither route
leaves huge amounts of crap in the kernel. I don't know WTF was in Andre's
patch besides the block needed, but there's something BIG added...

The second part may not even be needed. One if statement is hardly the end
of the kernel.

Remove the "do arbitrary crap" API - it should never have existed. If some
other feature is needed, it will be added - that's another issue.

I'm not advocating a micro-kernel approach - quite the opposite, in fact.
I want the kernel to do all the hardware-related work, giving userspace a
nice, uniform, stable, secure platform to work on.

Remove the raw crap interface first. If someone needs a feature it used to
provide, implement that properly at a later date.

I doubt Netscape designed their browser with low-level diagnostics in
mind...
