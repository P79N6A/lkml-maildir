Adam,
Yes, this looks good.  The module loads and fails cleanly.  /proc/ioports is
then readable.  Thanks for this fix.
However, this doesn't fix the loading of the module without in-kernel isapnp.
# modprobe --verbose snd-sbawe
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.0-test1/kernel/sound/isa/sb/snd-sbawe.ko
sbawe: fatal error - EMU-8000 synthesizer not detected at 0x620
Sound Blaster 16 soundcard not found or device busy
In case, if you have non-AWE card, try snd-sb16 module
FATAL: Error inserting snd_sbawe (/lib/modules/2.6.0-test1/kernel/sound/isa/sb/snd-sbawe.ko): No such device
Specifying the parameters (port, irq, awe_port, etc.) doesn't seem to help.
In-kernel isapnp has been working though.
Thanks
-Chris
