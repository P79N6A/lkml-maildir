The init_cpu_khz patch is the one that displays the calibrated CPU
frequency. The two patches listed above address independent bugs.

Yes, Thomas pointed out that the sched_clock->monotonic_clock patch
didn't seem to work for pmtmr. I'm looking into if the pmtmr's
montonic_clock call is doing the right thing (didn't have my laptop
yesterday). 
For now Thomas' patch to switch on "use_tsc" is the best fix when using
the pmtmr.

No, its just cosmetic. Both Thomas and I have sent out a patch that
initializes the name field in the pmtmr's timer_opts struct.

I appreciate the testing and feedback!
