Power-of-two can be desirable when using a 32 KiHz oscillator, because
other values accumulate rounding errors ... you can't make 100 Hz, or
250 Hz, or 300 Hz, or 1000 Hz, by a binary division of 32 KiHz.
Other values were supported to help work around stupid software making
bad assumptions about HZ.  IMO, enforcing power-of-two would be better;
that software breaks with dyntick anyway, and needs fixing.

A better argument would be that GENERIC_TIME exists (and works
on OMAP and AT91), which avoids some flavors of rounding error.
ISTR those CONFIG_HZ options predate GENERIC_TIME support.
However, the issue remains that most kernel times are measured in
jiffies not ktime_t -- they're easier and more efficient, all
those 64-bit multiplies can hurt on ARM (32-bit, non-GHz) -- so
it's still good to be able to ensure that jiffies-centric logic
won't always be inserting easily avoidable errors.
