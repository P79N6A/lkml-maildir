Hello,
This is my first time posting on this list.  Currently, I am working
on a powerpc board and I encounter some problems.  When I do the
following:
1. Login to my card from pc as root
2. Run command (i.e. ls, ps, etc.)
3. Wait 30 min-1hr
4. Run command
After the fourth step, I only see the partial output of the command
and my telnet session becomes unresponsive and I have to connect
again.  This same issue occurs even on ssh leading me to believe that
there is an inherent network driver issue.  I am using the e100
drivers in the 2.6.16 kernel.  Are there any issues with this driver?
Are there any patches for it?  I am running on busybox 1.7.1 with the
eldk 4.1 toolchain.  I appreciate anyone's help.
Thanks,
Royous
