No. Giving a major and minor number is simple. 
Creating a device node means: you have to define a policy. Now the kernel 
has to think about:
- user id
- group id
- access rights
- naming
These are the reasons why devfsd was/is necessary for devfs.
A Kernel should only enforce a policy, it should not define it.
