With journalling filesystems you needn't worry _too_ much about losing 
data; depending of course on what you're hacking on. Having two separate 
boxen for development and testing is mostly valuable because you can keep 
working when you break it - it doesn't take your entire desktop environment 
down with it.

If you're developing device drivers and have the choice, pick something 
esoteric to enforce good behaviour. Something which does out-of-order 
stores, has non-cache-coherent DMA, is big-endian and preferably 64-bit. I 
think both mips64 and sparc64 boards can meet all those criteria - if not, 
get as close as you can.
