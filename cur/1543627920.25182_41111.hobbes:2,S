I took advantage of IBM's public mainframe system running Linux and 
compiled up a copy of BitKeeper on it.  Didn't have to change a single
line, just worked, thanks to gcc -Wall and friends.
This isn't a BK thing, it's a Linux thing.  It's amazingly cool to me
that Linux runs on stuff as small as all sorts of embedded devices,
up to tiny PC's like a netwinder, all the way up to mainframes.
I'd really like to see the IBM guys let the walls between the linux
instances down a bit.  If I could mmap the other linux instances
memory, that's a kickass system.
Anyway, kudos to the people who did the Linux/390 stuff, we'll
include it in our list of supported platforms next release.
