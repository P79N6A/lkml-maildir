Allowing drivers that can take advantage of large numbers of
irqs is part of this patch.  To be clear the method still supports
allocate a bunch of irqs and then falling back.
We have to kinds of drivers.  Those that allocate a lot of irqs and
allocate fewer if they can't get them, and those just allocate a
couple and fail if they can't get them. 
The policy I deleted tries to be fair, and give all drivers the
same number of irqs.  What I left us with is a simple first
come first serve policy.
To do better you need an accurate count and you need to separate
out the various kinds of drivers, and you need a shortage of
irqs.
Currently x86_64 hardware supports up to 244*NR_CPUS irqs.  I
don't expect we will exceed that limit any time soon even with
a first come first serve policy.  
The worst case I can think of with your proposed irq allocation
policy in the mthca driver is a 128 cpu machine with 128 IB cards
in it.  That would just barely fail with every driver allocating
3 IRQs per cpu, and it could be trivially fixed by putting in
dual core cpus :)
So when we exceed the limit on the number of IRQs we actually
have then it probably makes sense to see if a policy more
aggressive than first come first serve makes sense.  But until
then it is a waste of time and we should be concentrating
our efforts on making more IRQs usable.
