Subject: [oom]: [0/4] fix OOM deadlock running OAST

While running OAST to test 2.6's maximum client capacity, the kernel
deadlocked instead of properly OOM'ing. The obvious cause was the
line if (nr_swap_pages > 0) in out_of_memory(), which fails to account
for pinned allocations. This can't simply be removed. The following
patches attempt to give the kernel the ability to discriminate between
pinned and unpinned allocations in order to determine whether this
check is appropriate. They furthermore also add reporting of wired
memory on a global and per-zone basis.
