Well, for one thing you just made your USB modem useless for dialout,
since you can't set the proper permissions for whomever you want to be
able to access your device.  And they need to *stick* -- that implies
persistent storage.  I'm sure there are similar considerations for many
other peripherals.
/dev/pts is a unique special case, because pty's aren't actually devices
-- they are really just a weird kind of fifo or socket.  When they're
not actively being used, they don't exist, and any persistence is not
only unneccessary, but in fact undesirable.
