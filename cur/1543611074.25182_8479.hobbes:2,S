You may want to look into utilizing CVS for the check-in/check-out
mechanism and just virtualizing that layer on top of whatever FS is
being used.... 
This may be a good place to start looking.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cvsfs/
If you don't need all the sophistication of CVS perhaps RCS would do.
 
The way Coda does it is by "hoarding" files, you specify what files you
want to hoard, and it refers to those as local only, when you "un-hoard"
them it syncs them with the server  (I think this is the process, it's
been a while since I played with it.)
I think intermezzo has something similar, but neither does any revision
control.
