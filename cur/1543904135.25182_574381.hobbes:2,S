The third one would randomize __GFP_MOVABLE allocs from the page allocator 
since one __GFP_MOVABLE alloc may allocate a slab that is then used for 
!__GFP_MOVABLE allocs.
Maybe something like this? Note that we may get into some churn here 
since slab allocations that any of these flags will BUG.
GFP_LEVEL_MASK: Remove __GFP_COLD, __GFP_COMP and __GFPMOVABLE
Add an explanation for the GFP_LEVEL_MASK and remove the flags
that should not be passed through derived allocators.
