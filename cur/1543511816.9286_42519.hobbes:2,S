I notice that 2.3.19 contains part but not all of a
large-disk patch. In particular, fs/partitions/msdos.c
calls ide_xlate_1024 using the prototype
	extern int ide_xlate_1024(kdev_t, int, int, const char *);
while drivers/block/ide.c still has the old situation with
	int ide_xlate_1024 (kdev_t i_rdev, int xparm, const char *msg);
Thus, bad things may happen if your disk is such that ide_xlate_1024()
will be called. (Oops, or bad geometry, or ...)
