The following problem which I reported here on 2nd July seems to be fixed in
2.4.0-test5.  I've run bonnie++ all night on a RAID-1 array and it hasn't
locked up.
Tonight I will test running bonnie++ while a dirty RAID-1 array is syncing
and perform a variety of other tests.  If I find any problems I'll inform
you.  Otherwise please assume that this problem is fixed.
