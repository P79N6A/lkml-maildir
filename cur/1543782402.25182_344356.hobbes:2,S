root:sleipner:~# modprobe hotkey
FATAL: Error inserting hotkey
(/lib/modules/2.6.13-rc7/kernel/drivers/acpi/hotkey.ko): No such device
Not that I care, but it at least loaded in -rc6 and created the
/proc/acpi/hotkey directory with its content.
When the revolution comes, the author of acpi-hotkey.txt will face the
wall first.
