Oh god not this again.
We went through this cycle during 1.3 and during 2.1 and in both times ended
up back where we were.
Ok so how does a non setuid application receive the ICMP errors it needs to
make intelligent decisions about load balancing UDP queries in 2.3.x ? If
you can't answer that problem cleanly then your change is broken.
Not reporting the error is even more stupid than reporting it. Its always
been configurable before. Still it may explain why 2.3.x now hangs during boot
starting userspace apps here.
