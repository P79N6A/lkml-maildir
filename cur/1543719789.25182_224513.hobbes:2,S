hi,
last evening i had some major problems with my harddrive as described
below. since the harddisk is now working again and the errors did not
show up under liunx-2.4 i doubt it was a hardware problem at all.
while having lots of disk activity (try to find out how BK works :), at
some point i got "read-only filesystem" errors, and these in my logfile:
kernel: sym0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=3 DBC=11000e00 SBCL=ae
kernel: sym0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=3 DBC=11000e00 SBCL=ae
kernel: sym0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=3 DBC=11000000 SBCL=29
kernel: sym0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=3 DBC=11000e00 SBCL=ae
kernel: sym0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=3 DBC=11000a00 SBCL=ae
kernel: sym0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=3 DBC=11000600 SBCL=ae
kernel: SCSI error : <0 0 0 0> return code = 0x8000002
kernel: Current sda: sense key Aborted Command
kernel: Additional sense: Initiator detected error message received
kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 14806480
kernel: sym0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=3 DBC=11000e00 SBCL=ae
kernel: sym0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=3 DBC=11000e00 SBCL=ae
the messages repeat, but were not written to the logfile, because the fs
was mounted read-only already (although the ext3fs superblock said
"continue" in case of errors.) ok, halted the machine, i read some
news-threads with the same problems and they said these were mot likely
kernel-problems. ok, checked cabling/termination, plugged-off/-in again
the cables, booting again to the recent 2.6-BK. smartmontools revealed
no errors, passed all test. hd-utility from vendor said "all ok". but
then again compiling a kernel (read: lots of disk-activity) failed
because of the very same errors. booted to 2.4 and was finally able to
at least update 2.6-BK and then compile it again. i'm running this 2.6
now and the error seems to be gone.
was it really a kernel-error at all or just the scsi-hw going nuts for
2h and then again works flawlessy again?
Thank you for your thoughts,
Christian.
