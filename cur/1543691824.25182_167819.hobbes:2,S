Hi All!
just verified that the patches still apply on  
linux-2.6.0-test5-bk9 and linux-2.4.23-pre5  
without any issues ...
FYI, this patch (hopefully) allows RO --bind mounts 
to 'behave' like other ro mounted filesystems ...
AFAIK, it handles the following cases as expected:
 - open (read/write/trunc), create
 - link, symlink, unlink
 - mknod (reg/block/char/fifo), mkfifo
 - mkdir, rmdir
 - (f)chown, (f)chmod, utimes
 - ioctl (gen/ext2/ext3/reiser)
 - access, truncate
it doesn't handle update_atime() yet (Al Viro is still
busy ;) and it doesn't change current intermezzo code 
(but this would be easy to add, because it's almost the 
same as the vfs_*()s at least regarding ro --bind mounts)
you can get them at:
