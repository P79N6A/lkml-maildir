Because there is no generic definition of struct spinlock.

You're assuming:
 - a spinlock is an atomic_t.
 - Said atomic_t uses RW_LOCK_BIAS to indicate locked/unlocked.
This is true for m32r, but not for sparc.  SuperH looks completely
broken -- I don't see how holding a read lock prevents someone else from
getting a write lock.  The SH write_trylock uses RW_LOCK_BIAS, but
write_lock doesn't.  Are there any SMP SH machines?
