I don't recall ever seeing a PCI driver do that... and if it exists on 
the PCI side, I would be motivated to create patches to "fix" such 
behavior :)
That information is exported to utilities that expect that table to be 
static.  Messing around with it is just hacky, and bound to produce 
unwanted edge cases.
