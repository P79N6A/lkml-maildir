Well, it's always easy to point to userspace. However, unregister_netdev() 
initiates a lot of actions. IPv4 addresses and routes are removed, same for 
IPv6, IPX, Appletalk etc. Stacked VLAN devices are recursively unregistered 
(even though I have not tried yet if it works when I create VLANs over 802.3 
emulated wlan interfaces ;-), udev bloat runs. And all this stuff has to be 
restored by the nifty new configuration utility, possibly including ifindex 
and future protocols.
This is from my usage pattern that I want to go into monitor mode on current 
channel, look at some packets and return to the association without losing 
layer 3 configuration.
So after all, it is IMHO way less painful to handle a mode change in the 
kernel.
