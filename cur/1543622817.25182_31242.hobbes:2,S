  Hello Erik,
    I hope this is not to ignorant a question: From your post I do not
understand what costs around $15k (yes generally I understand protecting
source) but specifically, is this for patent, copyright or some strange
relicensing fee. Not that I am interested in that line of action, but just
the ambiguity piqued my interest. I would appreciate any level of
elaboration.
Thanks much,
Karl Tatgenhorst
