kdb v0.6 is out of date and no longer supported.  kdb v1.5 against
2.2.18 is in 
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/download/ix86/,
 it supports
modules correctly.  This patch is only there as a courtesy, SGI do not
support kdb on 2.2 kernels, all our debugging work is on 2.4 kernels.
If you want to use kdb on 2.2 kernels, you are pretty much on your own.
