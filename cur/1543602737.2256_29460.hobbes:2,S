Hello.
Thanks a lot for Your response.

Why? The next three lines is
	for (;;) {
		schedule();
		__set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
And if I misunderstand schedule()'s
still_running:
	if (!(prev->cpus_allowed & (1UL << this_cpu)))
		goto still_running_back;
Ingo's patch was buggy as well.

Again, I can't understand. The new loop
	for (;;) {
		schedule();
		__set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
		do {
			do_softirq();
			if (current->need_resched)
				goto preempt;
		} while (softirq_pending(cpu));
		continue;
preempt:
		__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
	}
seems to be _equivalent_ to Ingo's ... 
What i am missed? I apologize in advance, if it is
something obvious.
