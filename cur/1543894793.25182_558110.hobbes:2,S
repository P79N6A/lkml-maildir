You mean the bits against Tivoization in it, right.
You point out reasons you dislike the particular wording (good, can
you relay them to gplv3.fsf.org, please?), but nowhere do you show
where such provisions hamper the tit-for-tat goal that Linus likes
about GPLv2 and claims to be the reason he chose v2.  In fact, I've
shown evidence that anti-Tivoization increases this tit-for-tat.
Still, v2 is preferred over v3 under these grounds.  How can it be?

Yup.  I got your opinion.  Now I got it twice, and others got it
once.  How about others' opinions?
And, more importantly, how does that provision conflict with your
personal goals WRT Linux?
