I'd argue that the lack of standardization/integration was the problem.
MIME sucks, but it's still everywhere. If mailer hooks to PGP were more
universal and transparent, PGP's interface wouldn't have mattered. Receive
key with trusted signature? -> File it. Send a message -> recipient's key
in addressbook? -> automatically encrypt. Otherwise just sign.
