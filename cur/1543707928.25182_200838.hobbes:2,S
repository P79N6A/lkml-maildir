Yea, thats exactly the corner case which the last-minute tuner.c fix for
2.6.3 gets very wrong because the initialization code doesn't run :-/
Fix is already in the queue, I think both -mm and Linus' latest -bk have
that.

Thats just because tuning doesn't work at all and thus there is no
signal.

Use "options bttv card=16 tuner=5" instead, that should work.  I'll
probably drop the "tuner type=" insmod anyway in near future, just have
to check with other users of the tuner.o module that it wouldn't break
anything.
