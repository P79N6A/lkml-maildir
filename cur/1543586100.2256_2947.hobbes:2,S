I think, that's the same problem like the one i found in lxdialog...
  I've already sent a report+patch to
kbuild-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and to the menuconfig maintainer,
but nobody has answered yet. Here it is:
  I think, I've found a problem with the changes to
linux/scripts/lxdialog/checklist.c, which were introduced in Linux
2.2.19pre8. The problem is, that several calls to wrefresh() were
changed to wnoutrefresh(), but a doupdate() is missing. I'm seeing
broken dialogs here, for example in the 'Processor family'
checklist. I'm using libncurses 5.0 (5.0-6.0potato1). With the
following patch, the problem seems to be fixed. Is the Patch correct?
