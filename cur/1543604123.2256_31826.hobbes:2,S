Hi,
hopefully a simple question to answer: I get "cannot fork" messages on my
machine running some 20000 processes and threads (1 master proc, 3 threads),
where each (master) process opens a socket and does IP traffic over it.
Although there is plenty of memory left (4GB box, 2GB used, 0 swap), I get
"cannot fork - out of memory" when trying to increase the number of procs. (If
none of the procs does IP, I can start more [of course?!].)
Anything I can do to increase the number of active processes using IP? Any
kernel paramter, limit, sizing?
Many thanks for the help in advance!
Immanuel
