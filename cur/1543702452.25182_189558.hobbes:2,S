One side note I should warn of - my breakage (if such it be) was not
consistent.
To quote my original patch to Andrew:

This suggests that while I may well have broken the output side (what
the kernel displays when you read cpumasks in /proc/irq/prof_cpu_mask or
/proc/irq/<pid>/smp_affinity), it is less likely that I broke the input
side (the affect of writing a mask to these files).
