I'm not the official maintainer, but I have been doing ide-scsi patches
from time to time. But yeah, using playtrkind is just broken... It is
widely used apparently, and I can see that it is a more intuitive command
than the others, so we are probably not going to get rid of it just because
I say so...
So if you can do a clean patch for ide-scsi to support this, I'd be happy
to take a look.
