Very cool.

I bet qemu doesn't have a real descriptor cache unlike real CPUs.
So likely it is some disconnect between changing the backing GDT
and referencing the register. Reload %gs more aggressively?
Comparing with SimNow! (which should behave more like a real CPU)
might be also interesting.

per cpu data would be the prime candidate. It is pretty simple.

Please don't.
(weak point:)
- The stack protector code might work one day on i386 too.
