Can someone else look at this - I presently have no time for any
"community" work from the end of this week onwards, and shall be
bouncing all bugs to lkml.  I'm expecting this situation to continue
until maybe Christmas time.
I'm going to try to flush as much stuff from my patch queues as
possible for the remainder of this week, and then I think it'll
be up to others.
mbligh - please assign the default owner for:
- PCMCIA bugs to linux-pcmcia@lists.infradead.org
- serial bugs to, I guess, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
I'm not sure at present what's going to happen with "community"
ARM kernel work, but I think it will certainly not be progressing
very quickly.  I'll do what I can but I fear it won't be very much.

           Summary: pppd "IPCP: timeout sending Config-Requests"
    Kernel Version: 2.6.9-rc4
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: rmk@arm.linux.org.uk
         Submitter: vovan@planet.nl
Distribution: Gentoo
Hardware Environment: 
Software Environment: ppp-2.4.1 ( tested with ppp-2.4.2 - the same error )
Problem Description: With 2.6.9-rc4 I'm getting the error when dialing to my
provider. With older kernel versions everything works fine. After remote modem
cosed the connection (rcvd [CHAP Success id=0x29 ""]) pppd keeps sending
Config-Requests
sent [IPCP ConfReq id=0x1 <addr 192.168.1.2> <compress VJ 0f 01>]              
      
sent [CCP ConfReq id=0x1 <deflate 15> <deflate(old#) 15> <bsd v1 15>]
Steps to reproduce: 
1) Install kernel 2.6.9-rc4
2) use the following script to connect ( chap1 )
