I did this long back, and came up with an IMHO cleaner solution... I just
added a function kmem_cache_find() to mm/slab.c and exported it through
ksyms.c.  kmem_cache_find() just returns a pointer to an existing slab
cache. The code for it already exists in kmem_cache_create() (that's how
kmem_cache_create() checks if the cache already exists). 
So all my module had to do was call kmem_cache_find() and if it returned
non-NULL then use the existing cache, else create a new one.
Of course this assumes you can patch the kernel...
This was a long time ago - and I agree slab.c needs a cleanup, but I know
precious little about MM. I thought I was the only person using slabs from
modules...
