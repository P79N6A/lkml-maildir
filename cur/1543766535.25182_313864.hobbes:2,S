Hi Greg,
I think this could be important for any type of device, so the power
management subsystem and driver core should handle it.  I'm not really
sure if it's useful in pci alone, as it lacks the necessary ordering and
coordination.
I'm currently developing an interface for quieting devices without turning
them off in my Power Management model.  Pavel seems to also have plans along
those lines:
