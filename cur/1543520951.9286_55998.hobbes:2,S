I checked and you are right.  ANSI C just requires that it
be an arithmetic type [7.12.1] (and by other rules in the
document, a *standard* arithmetic type).
I'd look in the POSIX standard, but someone has borrowed
my copy and I've just noticed that it's not on-line [1].
I'd expect POSIX to at least constrain time_t's base type to
an integer type.
Note that an unsigned time_t would break a lot of code: all
UNIXen I know of will accept a mktime() with a date prior
to the start of the epoch.  Given that lots of people have
birth dates prior to the start of the epoch, calling mktime()
with such a value isn't unreasonable.
This strictly doesn't matter for the kernel, except that
implementing differing time types between the kernel and
C library causes surprises, and thus bugs.
Regards,
glen
