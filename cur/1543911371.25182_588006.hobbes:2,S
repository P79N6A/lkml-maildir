If you haven't had a patch accepted since 2.6.12, it's not really
clear you're still a contributor.
Giving various kernel janitors more votes than people doing more
difficult work might be frowned on though.
But I can see giving, say, the top N contributors by some simple
metric a vote. That'd broaden the base. (But given that only about 30%
of last year's KS attendees voted even though they were a more or less
captive audience, I'd be surprised if many bothered.)
The other part of the puzzle is including the wider Linux community.
