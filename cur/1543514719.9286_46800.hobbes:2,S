My design has one advantage: I need no global spinlocks, all spinlocks
are per-semaphore array.
The 'shortest path' for 'acquire a free semaphore' needs just one
spin_lock and one spin_unlock().
There is a global semaphore, but you need it only for array removal and
creation.

Which kmalloc() are you talking about? The spinlocks are allocated at
compile time, there is no kmalloc(). There is one spinlock per array,
not one spinlock per semaphore.
And which limit are you talking about?
* SEMMNI: (the number of semaphore arrays) currently 128. Is that really
a problem? With my patch, this means that 1Kb memory, allocated at
compile time. If you make this number 
* SEMOPM: <~ 160
* SEMMSL: < 512.
I think these 2 limits are problematic, but the first problem is the
stack usage, not kmalloc.
* SEMVMX: 32767. Should be ok.
all other limits are unused
