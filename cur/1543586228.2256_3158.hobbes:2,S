Hm... I found this somewhere near line 920 in opl3sa2.c. I am not a kernel 
hacker and this is first time I took a look into a kernel source code but 
this first "if" statement is not looking right to me. The initialization of 
the cfg[card] struct is what I need to be executed, but it is never executed 
because the variable "io" is never -1. I have removed the io == -1 condition 
from the first if-statement and now the driver is working. But it's still not 
the same quality as the one in kernel 2.2.17: I have no access to the mixer 
settings "bass" and "treble". But better than nothing and better than the 
8Bit-Soundblaster emulation. I hope this is working better in the next 
release.
                if(!isapnp && io == -1 ) {
                        if(io == -1 || irq == -1 || dma == -1 ||
                           dma2 == -1 || mss_io == -1) {
                                printk(KERN_ERR
                                       "opl3sa2: io, mss_io, irq, dma,  [...]
                                return -EINVAL;
                        }
 
                        cfg[card].io_base = io;
                        cfg[card].irq     = 0;
                        cfg[card].dma     = -1;
                        cfg[card].dma2    = -1;
                        [....]
