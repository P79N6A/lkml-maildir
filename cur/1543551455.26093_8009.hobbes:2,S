Sorry, I might not been clear enough, I meant the files are of size 0 in
the following file and also it's valinux mirror,
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/linux-2.2.17.tar.gz
I did not patch the sources, I was just extracting the tar file. 
Alan or someone who looks in the sources, please advice?
Thanks
Amit
