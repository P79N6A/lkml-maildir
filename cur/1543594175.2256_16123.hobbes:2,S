Disk speed is difficult.  I may enable and disable swap on any number of
very different disks and files.  And making it per-device won't help
that
much.  The device may have other partitions with varying access
patterns.
and sometimes differnet devices interfer with each other, such
as two IDE drives on the same cable.  Or several scsi drives
using up scsi (or pci!) bandwith for file access.
You may be able to get some useful approximations, but you
will probably not be able to get good numbers in all cases.
