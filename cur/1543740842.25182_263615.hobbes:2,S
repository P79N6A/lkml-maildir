Hrm... currently, those drivers just blindly go tap IO ports and ...
 - the isapnp stuff is _huge_, it's quite difficult to figure out what
to bring in and what not, and how to adapt it, especially since my
knowledge of the ISA stuff isn't that big
 - It's only about 2 or 3 drivers and none of theem uses isapnp at this
point anyway
It's really only about keyboard, floppy, and _maybe_ parport, I'm not
sure bringing in the whole isapnp stuff is worth it, but I'll have a
look. I'd appreciate if the workaround I posted could get in for now
though.
Ben.
