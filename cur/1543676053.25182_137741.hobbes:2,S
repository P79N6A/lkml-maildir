Yep, great catch! But, FYI, DaveM and Alexey, we tried
reproducing the stalls we (Dave Hansen, Troy Wilson) had
seen during SpecWeb99 runs and couldn't reproduce them on
2.5.69. (Same config, etc). So its possible our hang/stalls
were some other issue that got silently fixed (or more
likely, possibly the same thing but other changes minimized
us running into the problem).
thanks,
Nivedita
