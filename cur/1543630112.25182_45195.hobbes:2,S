Your initial premise seemed to include the offload of TCP
as well. Doesn't that mean:
application -> driver -> card [ creates full TCP/IP pkt ]
TCP is stateful, feature rich and highly configurable.
Do you expect that a fw/hw implementation will provide
an equivalent implementation?  Support for tuning, options,
network taps, diag, bug fixes, feature tweaks, ... ?
Very curious..
thanks,
Nivedita
