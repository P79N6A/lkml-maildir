Exactly.  In fact we can be more specific -- the "Macintoshes" in
question are the old-fashioned NuBus-based 68k toaster boxes, not the
more recent designs with a PCI bus.  Relevant stuff in the
Configure.help implies that MAC_SCC and MAC_SCSI enable support for
the on-board hardware built into those puppies.

You're really talking about a different issue here,  autoconfiguration
rather than static dependencies.  Giacomo Catenazzi is working on that.

Let us hope our weapons are never needed --but do not forget what 
the common people knew when they demanded the Bill of Rights: An 
armed citizenry is the first defense, the best defense, and the 
final defense against tyranny.
   If guns are outlawed, only the government will have guns. Only 
the police, the secret police, the military, the hired servants of 
our rulers.  Only the government -- and a few outlaws.  I intend to 
be among the outlaws.
