Think at file_operations as very simple example, and try to find out what 
is actually called when somewhere the code does f_op->*(). How would you 
build the graph down there. You'd have to record all the functions that 
have been assigned to such method throughout the code, and nest *all* 
their graph in place. And this will eventually trigger false positives. 
Similar thing with functions that accepts callbacks, either directly or 
inside structures. And this doesn't even start to take aliasing into 
account. Hunting stack hungry functions is very good, and having a tool 
that is maybe 60% precise in detecting loops is fine too. But requiring 
metadata to be maintained to support such tool is IMO wrong.
