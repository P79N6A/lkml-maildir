Hi,
Is anybody actively maintaining the Linux floppy driver? I tried to mail
Alain Knaff a question but he does not seem to respond.
In a momentary lapse of reason I decided to improve the floppy support of
the Linux adfs driver for which I have to use Alain's zeroBased.patch to be
able to read sector 0 of a floppy.
I was wondering whether this patch (or similar functionality) will be
included in the official kernel tree. This would mean I could send my
modifications to the adfs driver to its maintainer (Russell King) for
inclusion in the official source.
