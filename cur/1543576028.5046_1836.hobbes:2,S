In simple terms all four `case'es form a single entity and therefore a
statement is necessary AFTER them and not in the MIDDLE. That is why gcc
doesn't complain about the `previous' ones.

That is NOT the issue. It has nothing to do with the compound statement.
There should be a statement after ONE OR MORE "case"s, but here
case 0: case 1: case 2: case 3:
is NOT followed by a statement.

Again this is a similar case. But if you write
x()
{
  goto out1;
  goto out2;
out1:
out2:
}
GCC will complain the absence of a statement after `out1:out2:`, but not
two complains for `out1' and `out2', because they form a single entity.
