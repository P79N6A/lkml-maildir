Jens,
(Sorry it took so long.)
nVidia holds the interesting specs private.  I don't know if fbcon is 
possible without the programming information (tho it may be possible).
I've tried vesafb, just for kicks, and I was unsuccessful.
If you like, see the Riva Enlightenment Project's web site at
  
http://web.chad.org/dev/riva-tnt
 
for a campaign to nVidia for programming info.
