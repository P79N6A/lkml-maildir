Hi,
installed 2.6.12-rc5 and noticed some strange behavior..
# while [ 1 ]; do cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state; done
present:                 yes
capacity state:          ok
charging state:          discharging
present rate:            0 mA
remaining capacity:      1840 mAh
present voltage:         14743 mV
<and so on...>
After a few second i get the following:
dswload-0294: *** Error: Looking up [PBST] in namespace,

and so on...
Machine is an Acer Travelmate 291lci laptop.
