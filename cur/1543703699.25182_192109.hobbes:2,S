It crashes as well, same "Fatal exception in interrupt" behaviour.
I disabled NETFILTER and recompiled (the config_security option was off in
the original setup already):
# CONFIG_NETFILTER is not set
# CONFIG_SECURITY is not set
Crash! I made a picture (sorry, no serial connection here) but unfortunately
the cable to my camera is at home, so if you need the information, you'll
have to wait. However, I guess the problem is easily reproducable. I posted
my .config file at 
http://valentijn.sessink.nl/temp/config-2.6.1-yangtse-isdn
(this being the config with netfilter, the one that's normally running).
The other end is running 2.6.1 as well, config is config-2.6.1-router
Please note that the config file that causes the crash is wrong, so a
documentation item that says "the Linux kernel is programmed to commit
suicide on brain dead IPsec configurations" will do ;-)
Best regards,
Valentijn
