Yes. I didn't even see that. The code there makes me kinda sick.
Anyway, the kill_motor function executes "reset diskette/disk" function
which will never turn OFF the drive. Instead, it will restart
the motor timer because, as a condition of reseting the diskette,
it must make sure the motor is running.
I suggest that the FDC control byte be read, then the result be
ANDed with ~0x10, then written back. The ifed-out code clears
the whole control word which is inappropriate at a time the
diskette channel may be still be active.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
