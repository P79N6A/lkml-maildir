So that there is only one declaration.  That way if it is changed,
everywhere that uses it will notice.  Also, the same header must be
included by the file that defines the variable or function so any
discrepancy between declaration and definition will be obvious.
i.e. we are protecting ourselves against change and making maintainance
easier.
In this particular case, the type is probably never going to change, but
consistency is good.
