ok, great. Regarding power consumption: i suspect a real difference will 
only show up on multi-socket systems that can do deeper C modes, or on 
multicore systems that will benefit from longer idle time on another 
core. (i suspect most multicore CPUs today will only truly save 
significant amounts of power if all cores are idle.) In any case, not 
doing these extra IPIs is definitely a plus.
