Subject: [patch 0/6] PS3 Storage Drivers for 2.6.23, take 4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Hi,
This is the fourth submission of the new PS3 storage drivers:
  [1] ps3: Preallocate bootmem memory for the PS3 FLASH ROM storage driver
  [2] ps3: Storage Driver Core
  [3] ps3: Storage device registration routines.
  [4] ps3: Disk Storage Driver
  [5] ps3: BD/DVD/CD-ROM Storage Driver
  [6] ps3: FLASH ROM Storage Driver
They are based on:
  - the current Linux kernel source tree,
  - plus the PS3 patches already submitted by Geoff Levand on linuxppc-dev,
  - plus the shost_priv() patch in scsi-misc (commit
    bcd92c9fbcc679ee95003083056f0441a1f474fa).
All issues raised during the previous review rounds should be fixed.
There were no more comments after the third submission.
Paul already integrated Geoff Levand's PS3 patches and the first 3 patches
in this series in the for-2.6.23 branch in powerpc.git.
Maintainers of block/SCSI/misc, can you please ack the last 3 patches so Paul
can take them, too?
Thanks in advance!
With kind regards,
Geert Uytterhoeven
