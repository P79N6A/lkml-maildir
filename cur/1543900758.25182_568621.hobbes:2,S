All laptops we have here, and those of all people I have seen
with laptops, do suspend-to-RAM on lid-close, not hibernate.
And even then, I generally wait to verify that the machine actually
did shut down, simply because the one time I didn't wait, Linux failed
to shutdown.  Which was discovered hours later at the end of the journey,
when a very hot notebook with a dead battery was unpacked.  Ugh.
Cheers
