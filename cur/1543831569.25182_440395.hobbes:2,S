Because the interface model is wrong ?
Various people have long said the model actually should look rather more
like
fs to block:
	handle = alloc_extent(near_handle*, info)
	write_extent(handle, buffer, offset, length)
	read_extent(handle, buffer, offset, length)
	free_extent(handle)
(probably with resize_extent)
This makes LVM, remapping, checksumming and the like all naturally slip
out of the fs but not into the block layer.
[Many very good points snipped]
