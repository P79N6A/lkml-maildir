You should be able to make DHCP work by sending ordinary unicast UDP
packets to the peer.  There shouldn't be any need to hack around with
special broadcast addresses.
Use AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, and send away.

I don't think that DHCP over PPP is a bad idea at all, particularly so
with DHCPINFORM messages, which are stateless and don't involve any
sort of address assignment.
PPP is not designed to provide arbitrary client application layer
configuration.  The RFC 1877 nonsense is a Microsoft proprietary thing
that doesn't actually work very well -- see my book for a more
substantial list of its flaws.
In contrast, DHCP works everywhere, includes *far* more configuration
information (such as boot servers, print servers, SIP addresses,
domain names, and the like), and is easier to manage than cramming
things into PPP.

The existing pppd already supports the MS proprietary hacks for DNS
and WINS server addresses.  Since that's a dead end, you'll need DHCP
if you want to go further.
