Which I think is a bad thing. Vendors work for their customers (hey,
even you said something like that) and /me as a customer wants to see
specs for the devices. So? Comply or die, dear vendor.
(Oh, I'm to buy a new laptop at some time. Any hints for a good machine?
Fully supported and not-that-much sucking? The sparc boxes from tadpole
look nice...)

It's nice if they actually work on drivers (ie. the e100 driver is more
stable on some chipset-buildin NICs than the eepro100), but that
wouldn't be the final factor for or against a decision about a product.
Documentation therefor matters! If a supplied driver is commented very
well, I'd even accept that for docs!

I think that most vendors actually do have specs for their hardware. In
most cases, it should even be enough to let them leak at some time...
This way they'd probably sell more hardware:)
