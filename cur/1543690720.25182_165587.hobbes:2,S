If a driver calls printk() while in ->write(), printk will fail to acquire
the console_sem.  The printk output will be buffered in log_buf[].  When
->write() releases console_sem it will then display the buffered text.
So the deadlocks to which you refer can only happen when the console driver
calls printk while holding driver locks, in a code path where console_sem
is not held.
