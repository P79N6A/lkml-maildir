Volume recognition is definitely a user space area. There are a huge array
of things you want to do in some environments that you cannot do from
kernel space
Simple example: We have mount by label, imagine trying to extend that in
kernel space to automatically do LDAP queries to find a remote handle to
the volume and NFS mount it. It's easy in user space.
