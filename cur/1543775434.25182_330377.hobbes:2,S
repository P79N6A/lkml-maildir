Ok, I did that and it worked fine, thanks! I'm trying to upload the
resulting dmesg so that you can see yourself, but it seems that my
University's site isn't working for some reason. :-(
Oh, I got one warning when I was compiling sbp2.c (it was something like an
invalid initialization around line 27xx--yes, yes, I know that this doesn't
help much, but I don't have the log of the compilation here).

Yes, it would help a lot if the fixes were included in 2.6.13 (final).
Thank you very much again, Rogério Brito.
