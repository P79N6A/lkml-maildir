Well...
  (1) when I wrote cachefs I didn't know that Solaris had such a thing
  (2) I don't know what Solaris syntax is - I've seen one example, and that
      didn't make a lot of sense
  (3) my way doesn't involve any changes to userspace programs such as mount

And the disadvantage that we'd have to change the VFS to support it, I
think. I don't know how this "layered filesystem" thing operates or is used,
so I'm guessing.

I doubt it. The netfs still has to interact with fscache internally to decide
how match netfs files to cache files, which is what most of the interface is
about; and to push/pull pages to/from the cache (this bit could possibly be
made transparent, but I'm not sure how you'd do it on Linux with the present
VM & VFS interfaces).
