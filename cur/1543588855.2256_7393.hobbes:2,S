Hmmmm...
quite possible. It's certainly true that a soft reboot from win2k leaves the
cs42xx stuff screwed on my Thinkpad T20 so it wouldn't be surprising to hear
of issues with other sound chips. I need to get around to dumping the
registers in the good and bad case to determine what on earth it futzed with
and undo it.
