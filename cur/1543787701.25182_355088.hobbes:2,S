There are a few cluster/parallel computing libraries out there that are 
starting to allow "process migration"...
One would assume that "saving it to a disk" is simply a degenerate case 
of migrating the process...
Presuming they have process migration working (and it seemed close a 
while ago when I last looked), saving to a file might already be 
supported...  I'd google "process migration" and you are likely to find 
a lot of discussion on this topic...
