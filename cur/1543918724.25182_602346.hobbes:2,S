Subject: [PATCH 0/2] [RFC] RT: Optionally allow IRQF_NODELAY on serial console
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series may help debugging certain circumstances where the serial
console is unreponsive (e.g. RT51+ spinner, or scheduler problem).  It changes
the serial8250 driver to use IRQF_NODELAY so that interrupts execute in irq
context instead of a kthread.
It works pretty well on this end, though it is admitted not fully baked.  For
instance, a few paths in sysrq can still call into non-raw spinlocks
(sched_debug_show, for instance) which will cause subsequent errors.  Also,
if you use KDB, be sure to convert the kdb_printf_lock to raw as well.  I may
send a KDB related patch seperately.
I am sending this out now in case it is helpful to someone.
Regards,
-Greg
