hm,
now i realise it that ive answered last message not sended new...
sorry about that... well again:
i want to install my root fs on my primary sata drive, its solo
plugged at the onboard controller atm. (at the point it works fine,
with 2.6.5...)
-disabling acpi  (no changes)
-disabling irq debug (no changes)
-change compatible mode (well bios option misses)
-disabling sata (well i want use it so disabling isnt that i want to know...)
well so heres my previous message i did send couple of minutes ago:
Hi there,
Got similar looking problem here,
i cant change sata modes or something alike...
I get *disabling irq* message with Intel ICH 4 / SIL 3112 A rev 01
SATA Controller on Asus P4G8X Deluxe board (P4 Northwood, Intel
*granite bay* E702 Chipsets) at distros which using newer kernel than
2.6.5, manual installation of kernel >= 2.6.7 fails
(well i think udev isnt creating devices or something cause after i
did try compile the kernel on my own etc...
kernel modules  found the sata controller, the devices and the
partitions, but hangsup with an *waiting for /dev/sda3 (my root disk)
to appear*)
my messages are known i think... but for completion:
(i did copied it from net this isn exactly my error
cause i dont know how to copy the error, after failed boot...)

i got that problem after a new installation of my system, before that
it worked with a 2.6.10 kernel on same system (something about 4 weeks
ago dont know settings anymore sorry...)
well im trying some different partition style layouts,
cause i just get that message with an seperate boot partition formated
with ext3,
if i set up a blank installation without that */boot* it works fine,
even with newer version's...
if u got an idea, need some logs infos etc message me :-)
