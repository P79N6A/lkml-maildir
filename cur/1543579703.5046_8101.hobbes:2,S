I actually saw a similar type of slowdown on my Inspiron 5000e with 2.4
(test10preX or test11preX, where I forget what X was, probably 5 or so).
Specifically, the following command read off the disk more slowly:
gzip -1 < /dev/hda | nc some_other_box some_port -w 1
even when I got rid of the gzip -1 (redirecting /dev/hda straight into nc,
or piping cat into nc).
In my case, the slowdown was clearly visible - the disk light was at full
brightness under 2.2.16, but not 2.4.0testwhatever.
I wanted to try again without any APM stuff in the kernel (or at least,
not APM CPU idling) before reporting it, but I never got a chance to do
that.
