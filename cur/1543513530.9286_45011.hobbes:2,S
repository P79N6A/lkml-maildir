Ok... then this raises a few questions:
- I'm not clear on the semantics of current->state.  In various places
  in the kernel, it is set to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, then may or may not
  be set back to TASK_RUNNING.  Is not setting it back to TASK_RUNNING
  a bug?  What are the consequences?  Should it be set inside the loop
  as above, or should I set it once, before entering the loop?
- Something like 95% of callers of schedule_timeout() ignore the
  return value.  Many seem to expect it to not return early: it is
  used for timed delays in many drivers.  Are these all bugs?
- Are signals the only reason for early-exit?  If so, then if I use
  TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, does that guarantee that the return value is
  always zero, so the loop is superfluous?  Why do virtually all
  drivers use TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, when it seems that UNINTERRUPTIBLE
  has the more appropriate semantics?
