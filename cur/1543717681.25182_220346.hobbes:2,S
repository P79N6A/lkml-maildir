What about something that's just simple and generic?  This is similar to
Andrea's disable_cap_mlock patch and the disabling capabilities patch
that wli produced back in that thread.  It would remove the hack, and
buy us some time to find better solutions.  Downside of course (as all
of these have) is reduced security value.
Against -mm2, thoughts?
