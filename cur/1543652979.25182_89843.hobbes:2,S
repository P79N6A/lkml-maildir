I've been playing with sysfs and notices something odd.  If I do this:
echo 1 > /sys/devices/sys/name
the process appears to be hung.  ^c won't return control to me.  If I
log in on another console though, I can't find it running in the process
list.  All I can do is kill the login process.  No kernel errors when I
do this, just the hung terminal.
