Do any of the previous test releases show this problem?  How are you booting  
Linux?  Full warm boot via the BIOS or some loadlin kind of boot?  If it's 
via the BIOS then does that show the L2 cache as being present?

And shows as 0 after warm boot?

My immediate thought was a BIOS problem.  IBM's web site doesn't say any BIOS 
updates fix L2 cache related problems, but then it doesn't seem to use 
technical descriptions like that.  It says the latest BIOS is 1.55 - R01_C9.

Or maybe it's possible that something in MS Windows 2000 is turning off the L2 
cache and it isn't getting reactivated by the warm boot?  What happens when 
you do a cold boot to Linux then reboot from there?
