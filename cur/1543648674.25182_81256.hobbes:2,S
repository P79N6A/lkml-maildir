Hiya...  Nice patch, must try it when I find a few minutes - I think I
have a few apps that are limited by select/poll behaviour.
I was looking at your jiffies_to_clock_t() macro, and I notice that it
will screw up badly if the user chooses a HZ value that isn't a multiple
of the normal value (e.g. 1000 is OK, 512 isn't).
How about tweaking the macro a little?  Instead of:
x / (HZ/USER_HZ)
you could use:
(x/HZ*USER_HZ + x%HZ*USER_HZ/HZ)
which minimises roundoff error and also won't overflow (at least, it
won't overflow as long as HZ*USER_HZ doesn't overflow!).
You could even use both versions of the macro, choosing between them at
compile time depending on whether or not (HZ % USER_HZ == 0).
What do you think?
cheers
Neil
