Mount -bind only modifies the transient memory storage of a directory. It 
doesn't change the filesystem. Each bind occupies memory, and on a reboot, 
the bind is gone.

been there done that, is is a "big mess of loops".
And you can't prevent the loops either, without scanning the entire graph, or
keeping a graph location reference embeded with the file.
Which then breaks "mv" for renaming directories... It would then have to
scan the entire graph again to locate a possble creation of a loop, and 
regenerate the graph location for every file.
