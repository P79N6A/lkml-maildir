oh it's *your own* netdev...
that makes things a lot easier ;)
it's custom to have driver private data per net dev
(see netdev_priv() to get it, alloc_etherdev() takes the size of it as
argument). It's custom to make that private data a struct in which you
can store the pci device pointer yourself, as well as any other per card
data that you need to store
