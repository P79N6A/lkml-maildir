I really don't like sending partial events. I don't think it's worth the
extra effort in tracking how much of an event we sent out last time. I
also don't see any added benefit to user space when providing partial
events. It's going to complicate the user space event parsing code to.

At first glance, I don't see any code to restart the partially sent
event. Am I missing the obvious or what? Without that, the user would
get the first half of an event, then get both halfs on the next read.
That simply won't work.
