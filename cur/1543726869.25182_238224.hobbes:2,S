I've found unusual results in this area. e.g. it does appear to matter
for mapping->tree_lock for database workloads that heavily share a
given file and access it in parallel. The radix tree walk, though
intuitively short, is long enough to make the rwlock a win in the
database-oriented uses and microbenchmarks starting around 4x.
