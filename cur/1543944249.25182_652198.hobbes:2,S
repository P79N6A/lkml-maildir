Let's put it like this: the amount of problems I found by reading
only about 20% of the kgdb patch justifies the statement above. Also
contrary to your repeated claims many of those are not fixed yet
as far as I can see.
Also every time I dig into something new problems raise their
head -- e.g. see earlier exchange with Jason about the likely
bogus recursion check.
Overall that's not a sign of a clean merge ready code base.
