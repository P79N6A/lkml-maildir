We found and patched this bug in one of our products. The patch was to
raise the loop counter to something more appropriate for our hardware.
The condition: the not-to-speedy embedded CPU and all ports in use.
The interrupt handler would hit the loop limit because the combination
of all ports running meant usually there was one port that needed
servicing, upping the loop count by one.
