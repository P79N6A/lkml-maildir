Because it requires changes to the personality driver (ie ide-disk,
ide-cd, etc). I only did those changes to ide-disk, didn't figure it was
worthwhile to do for ide-cd for instance. It's not exactly a
high-performance media :-)
If the device is always in dma mode, no changes are needed. It's when
you drop to pio the problem arises, and all the interrupt handlers need
to be fixed.
