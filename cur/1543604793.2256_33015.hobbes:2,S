Wouldn't something like "tcpehashbuckets" make a better boot tunable
than "tcpehashorder"?  Rounded up to next power of two before used.
I come at this from the PAGE_SIZE angle, rather than the TCP angle:
"order" tunables seem confusing to me (being interested in configurable
PAGE_SIZE).  And they're confusing to code too: note that the existing
calculation of goal from num_physpages gives you more hash buckets for
larger PAGE_SIZE (comment says "methodology is similar to that of the
buffer cache", but buffer cache gets it right - though for small memory,
would do better to multiply mempages by sizeof _before_ shifting right).
