And which kernel are you using?  We have other problem reports with
2.2.9, still unresolved.  If you could try the same patch against
2.2.5 or 2.2.7, that would help to narrow things down.
I have a parallel kernel build running in conjunction with the
pread/pwrite stress running on a 32MB 4-waySMP setup right now with no
apparent problems and no buffer leaks/lockups, using straight
2.2.10-pre2.  [update: the runs have now completed twice without any
sign of fault.]  The 2.2.9 corruption bug is definitely fixed, and
performance appears unaffected.
However, in case there is a problem with the patch, the diff below
backs out the more complex part of the fix and replaces it with a cure
just for the update_vm_cache() part of the fix.  It does not cure the
bug concerning the race during copy_from_user, but it should fix the
Typhoon bug in the simplest manner possible, just by moving the
mark_buffer_uptodate() to before the update_vm_cache() in
ext2_file_write.  I won't be able to test anything for the next week
or so as I'll be away for Usenix, so feel free to try both variants of
the fix.  I'll be online to respond to any experiences you have,
though.
