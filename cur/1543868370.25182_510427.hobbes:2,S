I think this is the wrong approach.  For one thing the unit terms is
rather foregin in Linux, and second this one header file "unit" is
definitly too much.  Normally you'd have as little as possible and at
most four:
 (1) internal definitions of the driver
 (2) external kernel interface of the driver if nessecary
 (3) user interface of the driver if nessecary
 (4) ondisk structure if nessecary
Also please make sure you submit patches at this driver level.  You really
want one git commit per driver that is totally self-contained.  If nessecary
you'd split this into multiple patches if a single one would be bigger then
the message size limit.
