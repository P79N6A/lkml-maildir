Hi there
Having put 8Gb of swap on one of our production database servers[1], I found
that "top", "free" et al report the amount of available swap space incorrectly.
This is because they all parse /proc/meminfo, and its counters seem to wrap
when they encounter very high numbers.  The relevant bit is the totalswap
member of "struct sysinfo"

As you can see, we are running redhat's "enterprise" 2.2.19 kernel.
I would be amazed if this bug were not also in the main 2.2.x tree.  Is a fix
likely or even possible in 2.2 ?
