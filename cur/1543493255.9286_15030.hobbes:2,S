Yes. But only if we aren't writing the full block.

Because it is more work.  There are no real good reasons.
We also have what I suspect is more significant in practice.
Double buffering of our data between the page cache and the buffer cache.
This causes copying and other overhead that can problematic.
For 2.3 for normal file data we will no longer use the buffer cache
so all of this should go away.
