I think you will find it is DMA on the samsung, I have a 2304 (I think,
its not plugged in at the moment) which always had major corruption
when DMA was enabled. Under windows the CDROM hardly operated at
all when DMA was activated approx 50% of the time the machine
would lock. These problems dont appear to affect my DVD drive
making me thing the cd drive is at fault. It works perfectly
when DMA is disabled though.
