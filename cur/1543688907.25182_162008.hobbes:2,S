This is taken from FreeS/Wan HOWTO.
"AES is a new US government block cipher standard, designed to replace the 
obsolete DES. If FreeS/WAN
using 3DES is not fast enough for your application, the AES patch may help.
To date (March 2002) we have had only one mailing list report of 
measurements with the patch applied. It
indicates that, at least for the tested load on that user's network, AES 
roughly doubles IPsec
hroughput."
