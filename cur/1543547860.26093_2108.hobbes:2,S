I remember reading a problem report in linuxppc-user mailing list.  If
that was you, I'd say you are asking a wrong list.  Only very few PPC 
kernel developers read messages from that list as far as I know.
I'd think linuxppc-dev for PPC specific problem and video4linux mailing
list for wintv specific problem would have been more appropriate.
Anyhow, since your card probably lacks Mac-compatible bios, make sure that
PCI memory and/or io accesses are enabled for your card.
For pmac/chrp(/prep?) variant of PPC platform, a (very localized) 
low-level kernel debugger called xmon is included with the source tree.
So, if you absolutely need one, it's there.
