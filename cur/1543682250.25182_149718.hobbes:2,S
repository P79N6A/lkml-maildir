It's uncommon of course. A 42G allocated all at once, may take a while
and 48G works flawlessy at peak performance w/o 4:4.  I support as much
as 64G all in a single shmfs file backed by bigpages (and it won't run
out of memory with a 64G box either, even with the 3:1 mapping)

so the apps will need changes and a kernel API way to know the hardware
page size provided by hugetlbfs (though they could probe for it with
many tries).

yes.
