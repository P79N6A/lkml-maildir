Subject: [ PATCH 0/7 ] UML - Header cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These are post-2.6.21 material, except that if the new definition of
ARRAY_SIZE goes to Linus, patch 1 in this series should go as well.
These patches are a response to the new ARRAY_SIZE.  UML had a
duplicate definition for the use of the userspace side of things,
which can't directly use kernel.h.  This header was included
everywhere, and had a random collection of stuff in it.
This series first gets UML building again by replacing the old
ARRAY_SIZE definition with one that expands to the same token
sequence.  Then user_util.h is dismantled, primarily into two, more
coherent headers, and deleted.  ARRAY_SIZE is reintroduced, but in a
header which is only included in userspace files, and in its old form,
so this version is lacking the extra typechecking.
The final patch in the series is unrelated to the rest - it adds
__init declarations to some functions which were lacking them.
