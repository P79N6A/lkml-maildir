Well, actually the original comment _does_ describe a gratuitous ARP, which
is defined as an ARP request sent for your own protocol address.  All ARP
requests are broadcast.  There are no responses to a gratuitous ARP, unless
there is an IP conflict.  However, you're right in that the gratuitous ARP
doesn't itself have anything to do with address conflict detection.  That
would be an additional (rather simple) step.  Gratuitous ARP's alone are
handy for hot-swapping routers or NIC's.
