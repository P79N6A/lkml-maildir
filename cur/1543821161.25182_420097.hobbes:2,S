Is it currently (2.6.16.x) possible to get list of modaliases supported by 
bultin drivers as opposed to modules? The feature is "nice to have" for 
autodetecting mkinitrd. I.e. currently it is mostly possible to walk up 
starting from root device, collect modaliases and resolve them to modules. 
But if modalias is not resolved there is no obvious way to check, if driver 
is builtin. Of course, it is always possible to take optimistic approach and 
assume driver is just available ...
