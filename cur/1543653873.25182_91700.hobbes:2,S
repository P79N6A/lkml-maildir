Are you actually seeing this code path or is this just what your script
is showing you?
preempt_schedule() will not call schedule() if the preempt_count is
non-zero.  Inside an interrupt handler, it is always at least one.  So
nothing will drop it to zero, and we will never preempt.

Same as above.  preempt_schedule() only calls schedule when
preempt_count is zero.  It is not if you hold a lock, and it is not
inside an interrupt handler.
