Ok, here we go:
...
PCI: Enabling bus mastering for device 10:18.0
host/usb-ohci.c: USB continue: usb-10:18.0 from host wakeup
PCI: Enabling bus mastering for device 10:19.0
host/usb-ohci.c: USB continue: usb-10:19.0 from host wakeup
eth0: resuming
adb: starting probe task...
adb devices: [2]: 2 c4 [3]: 3 1 [7]: 7 1f
ADB keyboard at 2, handler 1
ADB mouse at 3, handler set to 4 (trackpad)
adb: finished probe task...
RxR: 1
RxR: 2
tas: I2C byte write failed
udio jack plugged, muting speakers.
eth0: Link is up at 100 Mbps, half-duplex.
...
#
(I overread the "tas: I2C byte write failed" before ...)
Where I instrumented the code with:
static int
tas3004_leave_sleep(struct tas3004_data_t *self)
{
        unsigned char mcr = (1<<6)+(2<<4)+(2<<2);
        printk("RxR: 1\n");
        if (!self)
                return -1;
        printk("RxR: 2\n");
        /* Make sure something answers on the i2c bus */
        if (tas3004_write_register(self, TAS3004_REG_MCR, &mcr,
            WRITE_NORMAL | FORCE_WRITE) < 0)
                return -1;
        printk("RxR: 3\n");
so hm?!? - is the wakeup order of the devices incorrect (i2c needs to
be before damsound_pmac ...)?
