No, not what I meant at all.  I'm saying that currently (aside from
proposed patches) there is no such migration of pages; that we'd prefer
to implement migration in such a way that mlock does not inhibit it
(though there might prove to be strong arguments defeating that);
and that get_user_pages _must_ prevent migration (and if there
were already such migration, I'd be saying it _does_ prevent it).
