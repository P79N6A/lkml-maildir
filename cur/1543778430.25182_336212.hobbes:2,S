Is anyone but me interested in low power states for servers? I have 
several groups of servers which are lightly utilized for at least 12 
hours every day and on weekends. I currently use IDE drives so I can 
spin them down when idle, do logging either to a single drive or over 
the network whichever makes the most sense, and any drop in power use 
saves double, since I pay for the server power and the A/C power as well.
I haven't seen much discussion of this, but in many cases it would 
result in a saving, perhaps fairly large. Some environmental benefit as 
well, of course.
