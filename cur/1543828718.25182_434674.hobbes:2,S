Oh, I see - then it makes more sense that it gets away with being so
much simpler than set_cpus_allowed().
So here's another attempt.  However I'm not sure now whether
the first round of synchronization around stopmachine_thread_ack
is necessary anymore.  If any threads fail, we'll find out from the
kthread_create() return value, right?
Still I'm not sure about that, so first things first:
thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] kthread: update stop_machine to use kthread_bind
Update stop_machine to use the more efficient kthread_bind()
before running task in place of set_cpus_allowed() after.
