No, of course not.  But please be more specific than 'everything I've
seen from TimeSys is crap, I have talked to some of their clients who
had $FOO problem'.  Your complaint was so general as to not be
refutable.

I could not agree more.  Your original post had a strong ad hominem
flavor, which was my objection.  Of course you are free to attack
anything at any time, on its technical merits, this is what engineers
do.
I am interested in RT as well, I did not mean to imply that I don't find
it a valid topic for discussion on LKML, but you have to admit that your
post bordered on a troll.
