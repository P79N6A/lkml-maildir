Ok that would probably work, but you would need to export the GDT too.
I still don't see why we should do it - limit should be enough.

The latest code does that already - i dropped the cpuid code
completely and replaced it with LSL.

They can always map that themselves using cpuinfo. I would
prefer to not overload the single call too much.

Ok I see that, but it could be as well done by a small user space
library that reads cpuinfo once and maps given vgetcpu()
On the other hand I got people complaining who need some more
topology information (like number of cores/cpus), but /proc/cpuinfo
is quite slow and adds a lot of overhead to fast starting programs.
I've been pondering to put some more information about that
in the ELF aux vector, but exporting might work too. I suppose
exporting would require the vDSO first to give a sane interface.

Well, the complex mechanism you're proposing above only makes
sense if it is established more fields are needed (and cannot be satisfied
by reserving a few more segment selectors) I admit I'm not
quite convinced yet.
