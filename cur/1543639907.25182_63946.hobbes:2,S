There are issues regardless of the behaviour of "".   For example, here's
one of at least 8 ways I've identified where things can go wrong when
conditionals are misused.
#
# Testing mixed overlap, type 1
# (mixed overlap, define first, query conditional, same menu)
#
mainmenu_option next_comment
comment 'xconfig needs this menu'
    define_bool CONFIG_QUUX y
    bool 'Set this symbol to ON' CONFIG_FOO
    if [ "$CONFIG_FOO" = "y" ]; then
	bool 'Here QUUX is a query symbol' CONFIG_QUUX
    fi
endmenu
# Expected semantics:
# FOO=n => QUUX not asked, is y.
# FOO=y => QUUX asked, default y, can be either y or n.
# so list of valid configs is:
#   QUUX=y FOO=n
#   QUUX=y FOO=y
#   QUUX=n FOO=y
# Actual semantics, "make config"
# FOO=n => QUUX not asked, is y (CORRECT)
# FOO=y => QUUX asked, default y,
#   	   if y appears twice with same value (INCORRECT)
#          if n appears twice with different values (INCORRECT)
# list of produced configs:
#   QUUX=y FOO=n
#   QUUX=y FOO=y QUUX=y
#   QUUX=y FOO=y QUUX=n
# Actual semantics, "make menuconfig"
# FOO=n => QUUX not asked, is y (CORRECT)
# FOO=y => QUUX asked, default y,
#   	   if y appears twice with same value (INCORRECT)
#          cannot set to n (INCORRECT)
# list of produced configs:
#   QUUX=y FOO=n
#   QUUX=y FOO=y QUUX=y
# Actual semantics, "make xconfig"
# FOO=n => QUUX not asked
#   	   on save, get "ERROR - Attempting to write value for unconfigured variable (CONFIG_QUUX)"
#          does not save QUUX at all (INCORRECT)
# FOO=y => QUUX asked, default y,
#   	   if y appears twice with same value (INCORRECT)
