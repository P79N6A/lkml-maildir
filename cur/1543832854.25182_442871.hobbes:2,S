6) No MIME, no links, no compression, no attachments.  Just plain text.
Attachments make it difficult to review/comment.
You'll likely need to coax Andrew into merging/testing it in -mm
rather than sending it to Linus.

Patch comments:
Keep Kconfig help text to less than 80 columns so that it fits in
an xterm without requiring left/right scrolling.
Keep source code/comments within 80 columns (for xterms again).
So this comment needs to be broken/split:
+/* if USE_UNSORTED_SUPPLEMENTAL_GROUPS is set this is a linear search. If not it's a binary search */
In the groups_search() function, all data needs to be declared
before any executable code statements.
Lines like this:
+#ifdef USE_UNSORTED_SUPPLEMENTAL_GROUPS
should be:
+#ifdef CONFIG_USE_UNSORTED_SUPPLEMENTAL_GROUPS
i.e., the config system prefixes all config symbols with CONFIG_.
Was it tested like this?
Look at Documentation/SubmitChecklist along with
Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
