Subject: Crusoe math performance?

So I am fooling around with one of these things:
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineTMx86
cpu family      : 5
model           : 4
model name      : Transmeta(tm) Crusoe(tm) Processor TM5600
stepping        : 3
cpu MHz         : 533.348
cache size      : 512 KB
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
coma_bug        : no
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid level     : 1
wp              : yes
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr cx8 cmov mmx longrun
bogomips        : 1032.19
Anyone have any idea of FPU performance? I mean, compared to a Celeron or
Pentium in an application running an SSL web server would I expect 80%,
100%, 10%, 110% of the throughput of a Intel chip of the same clock speed?
Just thought this thing might be a good alternative to a Pentium SSL server
"furnace" and am looking for any comments from anyone that might have tested
it.  If I don't hear anything, I will post the numbers we come up with when
we get around to benchmarking them.
