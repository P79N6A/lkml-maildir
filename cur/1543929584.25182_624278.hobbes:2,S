Help yourself... as kmalloc() is a replacement for userspace glibc's
malloc, you can write your replacements for functions/operators in
libstdc++ (operators are just cosmetic, as many other features in C++)
In fact, for someone who dared to write a kernel C++ framework, the
very first function he has to write could be something like:
void* operator new(size_t sz)
{
	return kmalloc(sz,GPF_KERNEL);
}
And could write alternatives like
operator new(size_t sz,int flags) -> x = new(GPF_ATOMIC) X;
operator new(size_t sz,MemPool& pl) -> x = new(pool) X;
If you are curious, this page 
http://www.osdev.org/wiki/C_PlusPlus
has some clues about what should you implement to get rid of
libstdc++.
