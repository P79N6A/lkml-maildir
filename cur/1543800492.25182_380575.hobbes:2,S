we can have two types of breakages:
 - stuff wont build if not always_inline. Really easy to find and fix.
 - stuff wont work at all (e.g. vsyscalls) because they have some
   unspecified reliance on gcc's code output. Such code Is Bad anyway,
   and the breakage is still clear: the vsyscalls wont work at all, it's
   quickly found, the appropriate always_inline is inserted, and the
   incident is forgotten.
talking about 'safer' or 'risky' in this context is misleading, these 
are very clear symptoms which are easy to fix.
[ If you didnt talk about this uninline patch in the "we have to wait 
  one year" comment then please clarify that - all that came through to 
  me was some vague "lets wait with this" message, and it wasnt clear 
  (to me) which patch it applied to and why. ]

sure, that's another thing to do, but it's also clear that there's no 
reason to force inlines in the -Os case.
There are 22,000+ inline functions in the kernel right now (inlined 
about a 100,000 times), and we'd have to change _thousands_ of them. 
They are causing an unjustified code bloat of somewhere around 20-30%. 
(some of them are very much justified, especially in core kernel code)
to say it loud and clear again: our current way of handling inlines is 
_FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN_. To me this means that fundamental changes are 
needed for the _mechanics_ and meaning of inlines. We default to 'always 
inline' which has a current information to noise ratio of 1:10 perhaps.  
My patch changes the mechanics and meaning of inlines, and pretty much 
anything else but a change to the meaning of inlines will still result 
in the same scenario occuring over and over again.
