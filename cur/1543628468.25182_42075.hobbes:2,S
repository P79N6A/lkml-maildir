 definitely. Unless XFS is in the mainline kernel (marked as
experimantal if necessary) it will not get good exposure.
 The most important (only) reason I do not use it (and recommend our
customers against using it) is that at the moment it is impossible to
track both the kernel and XFS at the same time. This is a shame, because
I think that for some application XFS is superior to the other
alternatives (can be said about the other alternatives to :-).

 so, what were the main obstacles again? The VFS layer?
