Ok, here is commit which removed the code in question from acpi_power_off:
commit 6660316cb7a1a2c59a73a52870490c0f782f45c1
Author: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>

    [PATCH] acpi_power_off: Don't switch to the boot cpu
    machine_power_off on i386 and x86_64 now switch to the
    boot cpu out of paranoia and because the MP Specification indicates it
    is a good idea on reboot, so for those architectures it is a noop.
    I can't see anything in the acpi spec that requires you to be on
    the boot cpu to power off the system, so this should not be an issue
    for ia64.  In addition ia64 has the altix a massive multi-node
    system where switching to the boot cpu sounds insane as we may
    hot removed the boot cpu.
