If you mention about a relative jump which is inserted by
resume_execution(), I think you might misunderstand that relative jump.
The size of that relative jump, which will be embedded by kprobe-booster, is
5-bytes(not 1 byte). So it needs 5 bytes space.
And we decided not to expand MAX_INSN_SIZE when we developed the booster.
The reasons are:
 - it is supplemental feature(just accelerating kprobes), if we have no space,
   we can disable it.
 - 5 bytes are big enough compared with 15(=MAX_INSN_SIZE)
 - the lengths of most of instructions are less than 10 bytes.
Additionally, MAX_INSN_SIZE is used in kernel/kprobes.c to allocate an
instruction buffer which will be assigned to p->ainsn.insn. Since the
instruction buffer size is MAX_INSN_SIZE, you can not copy instructions
more than MAX_INSN_SIZE.
BTW, in my patch, I unified MAX_INSN_SIZE to bigger one(16).
I think it is enough for us.
Thanks,
Best Regards,
