Hi, all,
	I asked before why my linksys workgroup 5-port switch worked like
a hub
under heavy traffic (10mb/s) into one socket of the switch. The conclusion
is that the switch has some problem.
	In fact, for the first 5 minutes, it
works like a switch and then it works like a hub. The switching table is
messed up by the intense traffic, we believe. Other cheaper switches
(netgear fast esthernet switch FS108 ) have the same problem. We use a
CentreCom FS708, and then the problem is solved. Of course other expensive
and professional switches should be ok too, we think.
	Just some information.

It is really weird!
Host_10.1--->10.254_router_1.254--->Linksys 5-port workgroup switch-->Host1.1
                                       |               |
                                       |               |
                                       v               v
                                    Host_1.10        Host_1.5
Host_10.1 sends 1000 packets/s (pps) to Host_1.10. Host_1.10 receives the
packets. But Host_1.5 receives the packets too, while Host_1.1 does not
(by tcpdump -i any).
	What is the possible reason?
	Thanks!
