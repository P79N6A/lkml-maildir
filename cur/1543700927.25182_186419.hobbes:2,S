Most sparc64's are the same, as are the ancient sparc32 chips.
Most R4000/R5000 mips chips are like this as well.
It's stupid, but unfortunately pervasive. :)

That's right, but it could also have been because my approach to
the implementation sucked.
For example, if you just keep breaking apart order 1 or greater chunks
to give particular colors out, and later some of them get freed and some
of them don't, you get less and less buddy coalescing over time.
One idea to combat this is to make page liberation (ie. vmscan and friends)
smarter about this when swapping, kicking out page cache pages, or whatever.
Ie. see which freed pages have buddies we can liberate.  I never experimented
with any ideas like that.
