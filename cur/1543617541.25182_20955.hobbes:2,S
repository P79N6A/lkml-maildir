Subject: hex addresses in setup.S

Why does setup.S define the default system load address as 0x1000, and the
comment on the line explain this to be 0x10000(and gives the decimal
translation of 65536, so it's not a typo)? This seems to be true for several
addresss (0x9000 = 0x90000, etc). I'm sure there's something simple I'm
missing...what is it?
TIA,
chris
