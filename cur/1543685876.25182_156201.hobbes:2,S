Given the early nature of the test, its design was to catch devices which
fail to issue an abort for unsupported command sets.  This was to be a
means to flag the device as possible non-compliant.  It is okay to remove
or delete all, as clearly early warnings about standard command sets not
being supported was a silly design on my part.
Making all error messages hide by far is superior than exposing a
potential problem with hardware.  Maybe exposing the facts of media
forensics would clarify the issues; however, it is not that important.
