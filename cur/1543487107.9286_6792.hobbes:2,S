It's not a compile option; it's an ioctl.  You need to do something like
this:
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#define LP_STRICT 0x0200 /* from linux/include/linux/lp.h */
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int fd;
	int strict;
	if (argc < 3) return 1;
	strict = atoi (argv[2]);
	fd = open (argv[1], O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK);
	if (fd < 0) return 2;
	ioctl (fd, LP_STRICT, strict);
	close(fd);
	return 0;
}
Possible there is a version of tunelp that does this -- Andrea?
Tim.
