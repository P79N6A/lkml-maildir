I remember that a good DTMF decoder can be very simplistic: DTMF was designed 
for that.
The idea is:
- separate the high tones from the low tones.
- amplify clip the high band and the low band separately
- run the tone decoders on the clipped signals
The clipping stage would make sure that only relatively pure tones will trigger 
the detector.
