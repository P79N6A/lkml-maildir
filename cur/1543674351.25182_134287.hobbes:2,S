The in-kernel load balance does not move IRQs that are bound to particular CPUs. If the user-level can do it better, just set affinity, and I believe that is the current implementation.
The in-kernel one is simply trying to emulate functionality in the chipset, thus it's not so intelligent, of course. The major reason we need to do it in software is that x86 Linux does not update TPR(s).
Thanks,
Jun
