Subject: 2.6.2-mm1 won't compile (been doing this since 2.6.1-mm2 or so)

When I upgraded to 2.6.1-mm4, I did the usual thing, copied my old 
.config from 2.6.1-mm1 and did make oldconfig.
However, when I run make, this happens:
include/asm/processor.h:68: error: `CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT' 
undeclared here (not in a function)
include/asm/processor.h:68: error: requested alignment is not a constant
make[1]: *** [arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s] Error 1
The only way I've found to fix this is to add a manual #define for this 
symbol to autoconf.h
The config option IS in i386/defconfig, but for some reason doesn't get 
put into .config
if I add it to .config manually, it gets removed when I run make (?!?).
I don't think this happens if I delete .config and make one from scratch.
