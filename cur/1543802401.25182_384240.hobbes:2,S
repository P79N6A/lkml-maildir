I added the < 960MiB warning, but not for the 2G/2G as the option
depends on NOHIGHMEM right now.
I also changed the help text again, hope you are happy with it now.

Thanks! Updated patch below.

Add option for configuring the page offset, to better optimize the
kernel for higher memory machines. Enables users to get rid of high
memory for eg a 1GiB machine.
