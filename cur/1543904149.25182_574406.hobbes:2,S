You have not fixed the double-probe problem either.  That should have 
been fixed before 7e92b4fc34 was even considered for upstream.

Getting [back] to this thread, I know that most versions of Windows poke 
the serial port directly.  It's pretty obvious when running Windows in 
an emulator.

Color me skeptical.  I think we would have bug reports if we were really 
getting this wrong a lot of the time.

You seem to be missing that ignoring BIOS is often a VERY GOOD thing, 
that has served us well many many times in the past.
