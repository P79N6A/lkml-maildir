The thing about failures is, we're lucky enough to ever see even a single
end-user error log.  So when we do get the *one* error log from grandma,
it had better contain sufficient info for us to at least guess at the
solution, because grandma has gone back to OS/X in the meanwhile.  ;)
It's a good thing that failure paths are not normally "hot".
We can load those up with a little extra info, so long as they
cannot normally be trigged from userspace to generate a Denial-Of-Service
style of attack.
I think libata drive probing is a pretty safe area to show lots
of information (by default) when something goes wrong.
Cheers!
