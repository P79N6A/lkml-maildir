Yes, sorry, I'm so focussed on 2.5 I keep forgetting 2.4.

The name was simply to be consistent with BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY which is
another asm/io.h setting for this.
Could you elaborate more on the amd64 IOMMU window.  Is this a window
where IOMMU mapping always takes place?
I'm a bit reluctant to put a function like this in because the block
layer does a very good job of being separate from the dma layer. 
Maintaining this separation is one of the reasons I added a dma_mask to
the request_queue, not a generic device pointer.
