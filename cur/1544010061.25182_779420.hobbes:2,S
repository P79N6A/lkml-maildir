OK and thanks for your efforts to help investigate this.
As the patch I originally submitted still does fix the issue for me, I 
would personally be happy enough if that gets included.

I have tried one last thing: a suspend/resume with debugging enabled for 
the driver. Attached the results of a 'dmesg | grep 1394' split for boot 
up to suspend and for resume for easier comparison.
One possibly significant difference is that on boot there are two lines
"irq_handler: Bus reset requested" and "Cancel request received", which 
are not there during resume. That's even though in both cases 
ohci_initialize() is called which includes the trigger for the bus reset.
Significant?
