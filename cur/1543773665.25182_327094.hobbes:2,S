Bitfield order is a compiler property. Byte order is usually a processor
property and the two are not exactly connected.
A compiler given two bit fields can pack them from the high bit or from
the low bit and may do different things depending on the platform. The
defines tell the kernel whether the compiler packs bitfields into the
low bits first or the high bits first.
