Hmm. 
One other issue: we've been looking mostly at MMIO, but another thing that 
differs here is the PIO part.
Your patch only changes pbus_size_mem(), so what happens is that it avoids 
allocating the prefetch window. But it still allocates the PIO window, 
because pbus_size_io() is still run.
Maybe the PIO window matters? Any magic suspend registers are usually in 
PIO space, not in MMIO space. Did /proc/ioports change, and if so, how?
