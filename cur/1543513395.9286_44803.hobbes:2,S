Alan,
So, can one summarize that:
a) modules should call system calls via sys_call_table[] wrapped (if
necessary, i.e. if there is no user memory access) in 
setfs(getds())/setfs(old_fs).
b) non-modules should call them usually via sys_XXX() functions, except
special cases where they use inlined _syscallX() in order not to make a
function call (stack issues).
Regards,
Tigran.
