Great thanks a bunch.

Reguarding dm-crypt:
 I didn't get a response back when suggesting we store IV and MAC info for
 each block.  Can we do this?  Can I do this?  Where's the source, in
 2.3.6-main?  I'd like to implement this IV and optional OMAC stuff for
 encrypted filesyetems (I assume that's that dm-crypt is replacing)
