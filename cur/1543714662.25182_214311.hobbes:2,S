Subject: nfs 2 over udp file corruption

Hi,
I have the following strange behavior:
Copying a file over a nfs v2-udp mount
gets the file corrupted.. the command
exits saying "mv: closing <my_filename>: IO Error"
The first copy after mounting the nfs volume succeed
but next all fails.
The problem disappear when copying over a nfs v3-tcp
mount.
This behavior appears with kernel 2.6.5,
but not with 2.6.4 and previous.
My kernel is the client, the server is running fbsd 4.9..
I am running 2.6.5 compiled with gcc 3.3 20040217
and binutils 2.14.90.0.8 on a P4 2.6 with HT, 512 RAM.
