Oops, indeed.
Thanks, patch obviously correct and applied.
However, I further _suspect_ that the test should be extended to do
"!pte_dirty()" too, but I wouldn't want to add that without testing. As
you have an obvious test-case, would you mind trying with the following
modified version:

which also makes sure that the page will always be marked dirty after the
thing.

(pgd_none() <=> !pgd_present) for all cases except for the error cases.
Linux does not support swapped out page tables - it adds a surprising
amount to complexity for a fairly small gain.
So the stickler version to test a page directory entry is:
	if (pgd_none(entry)) goto no-entry
	if (pgd_bad(entry)) goto bad-entry
	.. it's present and usable ..
so pgd/pmd_present is basically not really ever usable (except as part of
the pgd/pmd_bad() test, where a non-present pmd/pgd is always considered
bad).
