Subject: Total machine lockup w/ current kernels while installing from CD

Hi,
I've built a CD that installs a customized system; basically what it does is 
boot from CD (iso9660) and run
mke2fs -m0 -j -O dir_index,filetype,has_journal,sparse_super /dev/hda1
mount -text3 /dev/hda1 /mnt/dest
rpm -r /mnt/dest -ivh /RPMS/*
This worked perfectly up until some recent kernel updates - with current 
kernels (both Linus and -mm branch), the system locks up totally at a random 
point during rpm installation (everything goes down, including the NumLock 
LED etc).
I'm currently building some old kernels to see when this problem was 
introduced and sort out what patch did it.
With 2.6.16-rc6, the problem occurs, but unlike later revisions it gives an 
error message before freezing:
BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!

I'll keep trying to isolate which patch introduced this; at the moment the 
last known working kernel is 2.6.15 (and 2.6.15-mm4), the first known broken 
one is 2.6.16-rc6; the ones in between are still waiting for the compile box.
