Thanks for the help, but a generic question. If my HW has a hotswap
controller (theoretically), I do not need any thrird party SW to handle the
hot swap insert/remove. Linux 2.4.18-3 Kernel should support this correct? I
should just run /sbin/hotplug pci on start up.

Hm, you might want to take a look at the cPCI patches from Scott Murray,
he has a solution for the resource and insertion problem that will
probably work for you.  You can find the patches on the pcihpd-discuss
mailing list, and I think they were also posted to lkml in the past too.
He's working on cleaning them up a bit for inclusion in the main kernel
tree.
Hope this helps,
