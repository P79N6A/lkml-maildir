Higher probability != optimal performance.
It depends on your execution context.  If it's part of a tight loop
which is executed often, then saving a cycle in the loop gains more
performance than saving icache, even on a 128k Celeron.
The execution context can depend on the input to the program, in which
case the faster of the two code sequences can depend on the program's
input too.  Then, for optimal performance, you need to profile the
"expected" inputs.

You obviously have not read the GAS documentation.
It has quite a good macro facility built in.
