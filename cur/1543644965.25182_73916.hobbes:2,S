Hello Jamal,
[took out AK und DaveM since I know they both read netdev and this reply

Yes, your assumption is correct and sorry for missing the cc once again.

I will contact you privately on this issue since I'm about to conduct 
tests this weekend.

Exactly (even wearing a netfilter T-shirt).

Great, I remember some of your postings about the netfilter framework.

Excellent, this could make it into my test suites as well.

I did, I simply didn't find the time to do it.

Is there a code architecture draft somewhere?
