I'm not sure that will do -- the disc is still spinning below us while we're 
delaying/sleeping. Alan just now suggested checking need_resched which 
sounds like okay advice. I'll be trying what still works...
(given that noone uses these drives for anything serious anymore I'm in fact 
also not overly worried about being a busy-looping pig and just saying "this 
hardware sucks, why are you using it?").
