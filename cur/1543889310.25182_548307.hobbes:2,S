So my understanding is, that although some issues with the libata pcmcia 
code where found, the latest issue is a pure pcmcia issue?
Anything I can supply or test to further narrow down the problem?
I have already posted lspci -vxxx and full dmesg log to the linux-kernel 
list, but here are some select pieces of it....
