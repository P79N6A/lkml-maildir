Need one more modification:
It is the libata policy to prefer use of numeric hexidecimal constants
for the PCI device id, rather than always defining a symbol in
include/linux/pci_ids.h.  The PCI device ID is a single-use "magic
number" that is only used in the PCI ID table.
Therefore, when your patch changes the hex numbers to constants, it is
reversing that policy.
Instead, please submit a patch that simply adds more hexidecimal PCI
device ids.
