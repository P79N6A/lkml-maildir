Can we get oprofile output for these tests please?  It will give us a clue as
to how much of hot spots the ext3 atomic counters are with this benchmark.
Also, it will be nice to have results for 3-5 iterations of the test
to make sure we are looking at statistically significant numbers.
Thanks,
Kiran
