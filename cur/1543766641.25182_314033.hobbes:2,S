Hi,
I sent this patch to Rusty Russell's trivial patch monkey _months_ ago
but its still not in mainline so here I send it again. So please apply
it to mainline.
Here is what it changes :
- Indent it nicely
- Add a tip that CNET network cards use Davicom chipsets
- Add Maintainers/Contributors to the end of documentation like in other docs.
Regards,
ismail
