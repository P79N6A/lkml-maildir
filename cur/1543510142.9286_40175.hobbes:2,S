	VOIP == Voice Over IP
	This kind of thing would be wonderful for constructing small
VOIP gateways, say 4 LTs in a chassis (and yes, some LT modems are
avail for < 30$) with a good CPU.  Compared to the cost of the other
options some H.323 gateway and gatekeeper software along with the
proper code for the LT would be a big savings.
