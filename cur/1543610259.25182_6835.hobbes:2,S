The best patch for this IMHO would be to just remove the stupid warning
from gcc. It's obvious that whoever added it has never used gcc inline
assembly.
If they want to remove multi-line strings they need to supply a way to
write inline assembly without strings first. Both solutions below
are very error prone and ugly.
Failing that:

Is bearable with some pains.
> #define NL "\n"
> 	asm(
> 	"	cmd	r,r" NL
> 	"lbl:	cmd	r,r" NL
Is also bearable, but needs agreement (needs a central #define)
