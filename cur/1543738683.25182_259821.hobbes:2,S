I guess I don't get it.  We want to prevent a DRM module that requires 
core API N with a drm_core that exports M, M != N, right?  So why not do 
that?  In that model don't you just need DRM_INTERNAL_VERSION?  With the 
setup you propose it seems like we could still have problems.  If a user 
installs a snapshot, then installs just a DRM from a later snapshot, etc.
