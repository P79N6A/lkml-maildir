Thought I'd try my bi-annual "poke at -mm". Results were less
than spectacular.

First the sound driver oopsed.
Then, the whole thing locked up after probing the parallel port.
I disabled it in the BIOS, and then it locked up probing the floppy drive..

System is still alive, and responds to keyboard, but makes no forward progress.
(sysrq-B spewed a lockdep trace and then rebooted. I'll try and get

That got me here.

Off to find a serial cable.
