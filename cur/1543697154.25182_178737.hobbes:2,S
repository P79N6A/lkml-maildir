First of all, /bin/true doing a fork() basically means you've
been hacked: there should not be any such code in there. The
open("/proc/17904///////////exe" is anouther piece of clear evidence
that your system has been hacked.
Why the additional slashes?
I suspect a library/or LD_PRELOAD hack which simply encodes the getpid()
return value in decimal notation and stores it right into a static
buffer containing
	"/proc//////////////////exe"
because it can't use sprintf at that point for some reason (maybe
just because it is a library/LD_PRELOAD hack).
