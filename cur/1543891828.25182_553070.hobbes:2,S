Unless you're planning on rearchitecting the entire VFS lookup and
permissions code, you would basically have to fall back onto having a
pool of service threads actually perform the I/O. That can just as
easily be done today in userland.
AFAICS, syslets should give you the means to implement a more scalable
scheme, but we'll have to wait and see if/when those are ready for
kernel inclusion.
