Sorry, but I am not in charge of that at all.  Please contact the
kernel.org web masters if you want to discuss this.  And as 2.6.14 now
has a documented security issue, I wouldn't recommend it being displayed
on the kernel.org page anyway.
Tools like ketchup can handle updating to the proper kernel version just
fine if you want to use it, instead of having to rely on web pages :)
