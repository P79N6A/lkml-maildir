kmap_atomic has limited slots, we currently use two slots for
process context and two slots for softirq context.  Adding support
for hardirq context can be done by using another two slots but
that would mean adding another conditional branch in the code path.
As it stands I have not seen any convincing use cases that would
justify this.
