It's not going to happen for 2.2.0.
I haven't been getting timely patches from the ISDN people, and if they
can't be bothered to send me patches, I can't be bothered to care.
Maybe making a 2.2.0 with non-working ISDN will make somebody wake up, at
this point I cannot care less any more. There is NO way the huge ISDN
change set will make it into 2.2.0.
