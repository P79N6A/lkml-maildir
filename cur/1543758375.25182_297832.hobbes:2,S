I have the same setup as Rafael, on i386 boxes. swsusp was very
messed-up for me in earlier 2.6.11-rc, but with -rc4 (or maybe it's one
of the -bk snapshots between -rc4 and -rc5) it works for me again.
Specifically, in the failing releases, swsusp would never succeed in
suspending the machine.
Since the problem is gone now, I think I have better uses for my time
than figuring out when the problem started and when it was fixed, but I
just wanted to mention that in fact there are problems in earlier
2.6.11-rc releases that seem to be fixed later on.
