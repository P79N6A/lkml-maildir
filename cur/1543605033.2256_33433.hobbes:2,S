hi!
i have the following hardware:
Asus CUR-DLS with ServerWorks Chip
2x P III 800 MHz
3x256 ECC RAM
ATI Rage XL
Symbios 53c1010
and the followin problem:
the system wil hang with two processors when i copy
about 300 MB (files or one file) from one HDD to another.
there is a complete hang up.
i tried the following:
change the Symbios 53c1010 to a Adaptec 29160
copied from from SCSI to SCSI, IDE to SCSI, IDE to IDE
probed the following kernel:
RedHat 7.1 standard, RH 7.1 iwth XFS standard, (v 1.0 and 1.0.1)
2.4.2, 2.4.2 with xfs, 2.4.5, 2.4.5 with xfs, 2.4.12 with xfs
and i have always the same problem.
is there anybody who has this board an can say it works with
2 cpu's?
thanks
