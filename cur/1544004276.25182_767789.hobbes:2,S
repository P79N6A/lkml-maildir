Hmm, this BUG message should have given you a register dump and a
backtrace.
Can you give it a "Alt-SysRQ-p" and show the output?
Actually, if you got this over a serial console or
similar, you're not getting the register dump because
the console loglevel is filtering them out.
If that's what's happening, reboot with "ignore_loglevel"
(I always boot with this option, by adding it to the
default kernel command line options in /etc/silo.conf)
Also, in situations where the system is already booted and
you want to see things like the Alt-SysRQ-p register dumps
on the console, you'll need to type something like
"Alt-SysRQ-8" to bump the console log level.
