It is not possible to reclaim the disk space until the program exits. 
This is because of demand paging of executables.  The file must be kept
around to handle possible future page faults, otherwise the program
would crash if it called code that hadn't been loaded yet or was
discarded due to memory pressure.  This is true of all filesystems.
