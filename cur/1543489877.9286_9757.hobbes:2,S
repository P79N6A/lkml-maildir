yep. OTOH, note that the printout itself is rate-limited. (it detects
1.5*10msec delays, which period restarts after the message is started).
For the already known case (SCSI resets) we already have a few messages
per 'event' anyway. Also, it should not be possible to trigger such huge
delays from user-space, if it's possible then we are in trouble anyway.
