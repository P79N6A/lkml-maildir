3Dfx driver was written to allow safe access to 3Dfx boards
by non-root users. The problem is that it doesn't play it's 
role well, because any user with access to /dev/3dfx can
write to arbitrary PCI config space of the card -> look at
doQueryUpdate(). In other words it gives you nothing over 
'+s' stuff.
