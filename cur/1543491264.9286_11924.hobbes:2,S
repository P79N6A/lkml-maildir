Hi,
I have to rewrite a driver which was originaly written for 1.2.x. It
uses the following structure:
                        if (current->signal & ~current->blocked)
                                return temp - buf ? : -EINTR;
                        current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
                        current->timeout = jiffies + read_sleep;
                        schedule();
How can it be converted to 2.2.x?
Daniel
