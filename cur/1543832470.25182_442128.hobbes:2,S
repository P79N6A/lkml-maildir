Are you using sendmail by any chance? :)
We start out with a low load averag, so sendmail forks as many
spamassassins as it can...

... and guess what?
The load average went through the roof, so sendmail stops forking
spamassassins.  Now nothing is running, and sendmail will not start
forking new spamassassins again until after the load average has
decayed to an acceptable level.
After that, it will fork way too many at once again, and the load
average will go through the roof.  Lather, rinse, repeat.
You'd probably be better off limiting the number of simultaneous
local mail deliveries to something reasonable, so the load average
always stays at an acceptable level - and more importantly, all of
the CPU capacity could be used if needed...
