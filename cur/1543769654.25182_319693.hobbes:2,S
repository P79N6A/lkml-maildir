No room for any more drivers. This just writes to a small LCD on an
embedded controller. There should be no reason why I can't
write directly to the physical memory. Anything written to the
physical screen buffer will show up on the screen, as long
as page zero is selected.
I think that I've discovered a bug. I know that what I have written gets
to the screen buffer because I can read in back! This doesn't make
any sense.
Cheers,
