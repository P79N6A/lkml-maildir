Hello all,
My setup is Intel 440GX MB with intergrated EEPro100.
When using Linux 2.2.18 the following happen: after reboot, I got:
     eepro100: cmd_wait for (0xffffff90) timedout with (0xffffff90)!
and NIC is dead.
After power cycle, first boot works fine and all following boots (without
power off) - see above. Very seldom (I've noticed this 2 times during
2 monthes) this happen during normal operation.
2.2.12 and 2.4.x runs without problem (but have other problems which
it unusable for me).
