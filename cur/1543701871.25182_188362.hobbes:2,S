You are right.  Thanks for very good explanation.

You don't need to export "initializing" variable from ide.c,
just use "pre_init" variable from setup-pci.c :-).

Except when using them for IDE PCI modules with non default ports:
- hwif->chipset is set to ide_generic during boot
- main IDE driver initialization
- module load fails (because hwif->chipset == ide_generic && !initializing)
You can fix it by replacing all current occurrences of ide_generic by some
new type (ide_forced).  It will also clear confusion about ide_generic name.

very minor nitpick:
if (hwif->chipset == ide_unknown)
	hwif->chipset = ide_generic;
Please correct patch and I will merge it.
