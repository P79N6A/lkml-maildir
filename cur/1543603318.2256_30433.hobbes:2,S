Given that 2.4.10+ have devices in page cache, is there _any_ reason
why what the kernel sees on a device would be different than what user
space reads from a device?  I don't think it was ever an issue between
whole-disk-dev and partition-dev aliasing, since both user-space and
the kernel are accessing the same device.
If not, then we can just change the PV_FLUSH code to not do
invalidate_buffers() on the device for kernels 2.4.10+.  There never
was a very strong reason to do it for disk identification.
Cheers, Andreas
CC'd LVM folks to get their input on this.
