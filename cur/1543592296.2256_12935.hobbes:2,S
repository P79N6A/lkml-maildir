Thanks. Interesting that you mention the Severworks LE chipset. We
have 2 identical machines with the intel STL MOBO wich uses
the Severworks LE. They are both dual PIII 1GHz 1GB mem and ultra
160 drives. I have had nothing but trouble getting RedHat 7.1 beta-1,
7.1 beta-2 and 7.1 release. The OS tended to install ok 
but on beta1, only the up kernel would boot. On beta-2 and release
both up and smp kernels would boot. On neither of the systems
have I managed to build a kernel up or smp, new or same version
as was installed. When I tried to boot the kernel I had built,
the scsi driver would fail to load. This also happen on the Redhat
installed smp kernel in beta-1 and on any of the redhat installed
kernels in either of beta-2 or release when I tried to use disk
striping.
Have you experienced any issues like this?
Have you successfuly built a kernel that booted on these machines?
Regards
Greg.
