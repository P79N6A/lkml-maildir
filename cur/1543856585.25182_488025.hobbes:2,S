Indeed yes.
Using container_of() and ditching the data value, you generally have to have
one extra instruction per timer handler, if that, but you are able to discard
one instruction or more from __run_timers() and struct timer_list discards a
word.
You will almost certainly have far more timer_list structs in the kernel than
timer handler functions, therefore it's a space win, and possibly also a time
win (if the reduction of __run_timers() is greater than the increase in the
timer handler).
And that extra instruction in the timer handler is usually going to be an
addition or subtraction of a small immediate value - which may be zero (in
which case the insn is dropped) or which may be folded directly into memory
access instruction offsets.
