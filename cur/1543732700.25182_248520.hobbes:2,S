No, there isn't.  You won't see any official kernel.org advisories
that could serve as guide, either.
However, your concentration might be a bit short-sighted.  Issues such
as stability (random crashes under load), data corruption (file
systems are corrupted on unmount) and performance (poor throughtput
with some USB devices) could be as important to your users as security
fixes.  In this area, vendor kernels can serve as a guide, too.
Unfortunately, there is no distributed source code management system
used by all these forks, so relating all those changes appears to be
quite complicated.
