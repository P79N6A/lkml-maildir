Subject: [PATCH 12/55] KVM: VMX: Let gcc to choose which registers to save (i386)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Laurent Vivier <Laurent.Vivier@bull.net>
This patch lets GCC to determine which registers to save when we
switch to/from a VCPU in the case of intel i386.
* Original code saves following registers:
    eax, ebx, ecx, edx, edi, esi, ebp (using popa)
* Patched code:
  - informs GCC that we modify following registers
    using the clobber description:
    ebx, edi, rsi
  - doesn't save eax because it is an output operand (vmx->fail)
  - cannot put ecx in clobber description because it is an input operand,
    but as we modify it and we want to keep its value (vcpu), we must
    save it (pop/push)
  - ebp is saved (pop/push) because GCC seems to ignore its use the clobber
    description.
  - edx is saved (pop/push) because it is reserved by GCC (REGPARM) and
    cannot be put in the clobber description.
  - line "mov (%%esp), %3 \n\t" has been removed because %3
    is ecx and ecx is restored just after.
