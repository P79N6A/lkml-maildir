That is a standard fact about UTP networks.

Read the subject line.  Does the statement you just made have any
relevance to it?  Is a two host network "largish"?  Sorry, coax
is definitely in.  We're not debating the FACTS of the advantages
and disadvantages of the different networking media available,
that we definitely agree on, because they are widely known and
not contested.  The fact is that we are talking about a VERY
SMALL home network of 2 machines that must also be cheap.  Cheap
is relative to the size of one's wallet, however coax is still
cheaper than UTP, once again when you put this messages Subject
header into the equation.
