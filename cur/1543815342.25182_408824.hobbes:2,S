I fully agree!
I am aware that sata_mv is early beta, and kernel 2.6.16-rc6-mm2 is
actually the first kernel which lets me really use my Marvell
controller (users should give feedback on that right ;-). Kudos to you
all!  (I don't know what happened between -rc6 and -rc6-mm2).
I know quite some people have their Marvell controller on a shelf
because they could not get it to work reliably. Now they can give it
another try..
Btw, without the hardware errata workarounds implemented yet, will it
eventually corrupt data for a fact? Are there any tests which will
trigger bugs, other than my simple dd-over-raid5?
