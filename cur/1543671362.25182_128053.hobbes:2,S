Linus, please do a
	bk pull bk://kernel.bkbits.net/jgarzik/irq-return-2.5
This will update the following files:

   s/int/unsigned int/ for irqreturn_t definition.
   
   Pragmatic change.  Would prefer to make it now rather than later.
   Though sign-extension problems are unlikely, I prefer 'unsigned int'
   because it occasionally generates better code, and 'int' occasionally
   generates sub-optimal code (because the compiler cannot rule out
   negative values during optimization).
   
   Better still would be to indicate the variable's true range
   via _Bool:  zero, and non-zero, but I did not make that change
   here.
