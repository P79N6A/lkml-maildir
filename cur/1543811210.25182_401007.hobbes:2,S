There is a difference. As kernel developers, we can put the responsibility to 
verify that a device can be operated legally on the user, as you said. A 
manufacturer, especially a huge one as Intel, is obligated to take this 
burden from their customers - obligated may be by law, may be by company 
policy.

If someone else reverse engineers and replaces the daemon, it may not be 
Intel's problem anymore - but that's all not the point.
Actually, Intel invested a lot of time to avoid shipping a binary only driver 
or a HAL like madwifi does. So however this settles, they deserve at least to 
be adressed in a less insulting tone than you do in your mails.
Thanks,
