Hi,
I've just released ROCK Linux 1.3.0. It's the first release of the 1.3.x
development tree. It's allready based on Linux 2.3.15 and XFree86 3.9.15
becouse Linux 2.4.0 and XFree 4.0 should be released by this fall. ROCK
Linux 1.4.0 will be released later at the end of this year. So I'm
allready working with the devel kernel and x11 to make a on-the-fly
adaption of ROCK Linux possible.
It also gives us the possibility to test the new kernel and the new
xfree86 allready in a compleate distribution which is based on it. As the
Linux Kernel 2.2.0 released i felt like beeing the only person compiling a
entire distribution based on it ...
*WARNING*: There is a good reason for calling it a "development tree". If
you are not interested in development you should take the stable ROCK
Linux 1.2.0. You should install the development releases only on a
seperate disk or a seperate computer where no importand data can be lost!
Currently I can't compile ROCK Linux when running the 2.3.15 kernel (I get
a lot of kernel faults). So you should allways have a 2.2.11 kernel handy
and use it for building the distribution.
You can get the source from "
http://linux.rock-projects.com/"
 or from the
mirrors (as soon as they are updated). There will be no binary
distribution for the development releases. A summary of changes can be
found at "
http://linux.rock-projects.com/misc/changes-1.3.0.txt".
yours,
 - clifford
