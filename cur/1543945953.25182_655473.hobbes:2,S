But we don't have /proc/proc.api or /sys/sysfs.api ...

[root@localhost mnt]# cat cgroup.api
debug.current_css_set_refcount  u64
debug.current_css_set   u64
debug.taskcount u64
debug.cgroup_refcount   u64
cgroup.release_agent    string  Path to release agent binary
cgroup.api      unknown Control file descriptions
cgroup.releasable       u64     Is this cgroup able to be freed when empty
cgroup.notify_on_release        u64     Should the release agent trigger when this cgroup is empty
cgroup.tasks    string  Thread ids of threads in this cgroup
It seems to me this is a little messy.
And is it better to describe the debug subsystem too?
