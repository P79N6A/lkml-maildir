Hmm, didn't see the email ... but I'm probably not cc'd on all the
thread.  However ... it isn't that you couldn't do it ... it's that you
don't want to do it because it's faster to violate the spec ... like all
those nice ATA devices that lie about having a cache and then let you
power down with uncommitted data still in it ... they work much faster
for HDIO tests ... and who ever switches their box off?
