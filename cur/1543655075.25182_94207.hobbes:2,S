No.
Only stupid people think they should throw away old proven concepts. 
What happens quite often in academia in particular is that you find a
problem you want to fix, and you re-design the whole system around your
fix. 
This is how we get crap like microkernels.  They have "an agenda", and
that's the _worst_ thing you can have when designing software.  You
fixate on some perceived problem, and the end result is that yes, maybe
you fixed _that_ problem, but in the meantime you also generated a whole
new of issues - usually things that were solved by the original
approach. 
The UNIX/Linux approach is a very pragmatic thing - leave the things
that work well alone.  There's no point in re-inventing the whole system
just because of some small perceived flaws.

Yeah, and look how much more secure it is than UNIX.
