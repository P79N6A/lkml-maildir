The DOS fdisk will rewrite the C/H/S values on the drive in some cases
if the drive is a vaguely modern setup. That will trash all the
partition data you have and can lead to corruption of the data too. If
you are luck the drive geometry originally used may match the one in
hdparm -I
If you can work out the original geometry values then put those back and
fsck all the partitions with file systems on them you may be ok.
