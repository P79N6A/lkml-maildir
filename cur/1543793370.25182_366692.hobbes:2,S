Presumably as soon as it does the sti, the CPU takes one or more interrupts
and runs off and does something.
I wonder what?
You could do something like:
int trace_irqs;
	trace_irqs = 1;
	local_irq_enble();
	trace_irqs = 0;
then, over in handle_IRQ_event():
	if (trace_irqs)
		print_symbol("calling %s\n", (unsigned long)action->handler);
