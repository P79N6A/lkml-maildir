thanks, applied.
btw., people have been talking about reducing the include file mess for 
nearly a decade now, but it didnt get that much better - at least not in 
include/asm-x86/*.h. So include file dependency flattening patches would 
be more than welcome as well. (and unlike unification patches they have 
no expectation of being 100% perfect, so a natural ping-pong of fixes, 
until the changes are fully correct, would be natural.)
