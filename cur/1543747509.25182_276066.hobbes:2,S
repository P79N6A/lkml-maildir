Yep... There is a slight problem with the way glibc has decided to
implement the statvfs function when interacting with 2.6.x kernels...
The POSIX definition of statvfs declares that the entry f_blocks (which
returns the size of the filesystem) shall be in units of f_frsize (see
the manpage).
OTOH the system call sys_statfs() still returns f_blocks in units of
f_bsize (as it has done since the dawn of Linux)...
So when glibc calls sys_statfs(), and then just copies the results into
the statvfs format structure, it is putting a value of f_blocks which is
in units of f_bsize into something that should be in units of f_frsize.
This was not a problem in Linux-2.4.x, 'cos glibc would simply emulate a
value for f_frsize by setting it to f_bsize.
However for 2.6.x kernels, glibc grabs a value of f_frsize that the
kernel gives it. So if that value differs from the bsize (and allowing
f_frsize != f_bsize is the whole point of passing a value for f_frsize
to glibc in the first place), you get wierd discrepancies like the
above.
Cheers,
