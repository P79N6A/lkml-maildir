Is there a document somewhere that has some hints and tips for
backporting 2.4 drivers to the 2.2 series?  I have the O'Reilly
Linux Device Drivers (second edition) book by Rubini and Corbet, 
but it's a little thin on this problem.
Specifically, the new 2.4 PCI-related functions like:
pci_alloc_consistent, pci_free_consistent, pci_enable_device...
>From this newbie's point of view, it seems that it would be really 
nice to have a little library of functions that wrap the older 2.2 
style interface to provide the 2.4-style functions...  or is this
impossible to do in a general way?
Thanks for any advice...
