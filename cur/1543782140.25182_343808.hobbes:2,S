CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME also has a problem on at least ARM OMAP where
the IO mapping to read the clock may not be initialized when
sched_clock() is called for the first time.
I'd hate to have to test for something for CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME
every time sched_clock() is being called.
The quick fix would seem to be to only allow CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME
from kernel cmdline to make it happen a bit later. So basically
make int printk_time = 0 until command line is evaluated.
