Hello.
Sorry if this is a FAQ, but I've searched the archives for this list
(
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/
) and only come with references
from 1996!
What is the state of Posix-compliant services (threads, semaphores, timers,
etc.) in the current (v2.2/v2.4) Linux kernels?
Thank you.
