Yes, for real world devices there is always the point to be considered
that you can buy a $15 card, and if your requirements are simple
enough, simply ignore the bits that you don't need, and drive it with
open source code.  The cost of developing a much simpler and slightly
cheaper solution outweighs the potential saving, so there is no real
incentive to develop it.
However, if the much simpler but cheaper project already existed, and
was as little as $1 cheaper to produce in volume, would embedded
manufacturers use it?  I suspect they would.

Well, the cost of fabricating depends on the device.  I was basically
thinking of a 68000, an EPROM and a SIMM on a piece of stripboard,
some ribbon cable and a DB-25 connector.
Maybe our goals are somewhat different :-)
