Ok sorry for bad language but as an XFS & KDE user I would like to see
better discussion like there maybe some workarounds for this apart
from them dumping KDE or XFS.
About the KDE config stuff it happens in kconfig.cpp which lies under
kdelibs/kdecore directory on CVS if you want to look at it.
Again sorry for bad language.
Cheers,
