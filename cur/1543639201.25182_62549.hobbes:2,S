Of course.

Let me repeat: Geometry does not exist.
It is impossible to know something that does not exist.
I can boot seven different kernels on my present machine
and get seven different geometries for /dev/hda.
You see that even "backward compatibility" is a
dubious concept here. Compatibility with what?
Even the BIOS is not consistent, and different BIOS functions
report different geometries.
We have had layer upon layer of bandaids.
I think the time is long overdue to get rid of it all.
> for the folks who have force ide translation
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "force ide translation" ?
