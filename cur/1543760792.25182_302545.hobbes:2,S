Sorry, but you should _never_ have gotten an ESTALE error if the file
was not in use when you deleted the old copy of glibc. A fresh call to
open() will always result in a new lookup of the filehandle.
What may have happened in the case of the EIO error is that you may have
raced: i.e. a client starts reading the file while it is being copied
to.
You'll rather want to ask Neil Brown about why subtree_check is still
the default for knfsd. He is the NFS server maintainer.
Cheers,
