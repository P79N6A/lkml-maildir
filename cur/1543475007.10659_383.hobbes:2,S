Subject: nfsfs problems with 2.2.0-pre4

I have 2.2.0-pre4 running on a 430TX-based K6-200 host with 64MB memory.
nfsfs appears to have problems. My nfs server runs 2.0.35 on a Cyrix
486DLC-40 with 32MB memory. I use 10BaseT for the network.
The symptom: when I attempt to invoke the Netscape Communicator Message
Compose window, I never get it and all of Communicator hangs. My hub
indicates furious activity, but it never gets anywhere.
With only a switch back to 2.0.36, everything works fine.
I have checked all my supporting software. I have Debian 2.1 in use.
If I have breached protocol, I offer an advance apology. I received this
address via the 2.2.0-pre4 discussion at slashdot.
