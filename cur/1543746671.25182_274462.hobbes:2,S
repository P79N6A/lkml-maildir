Pardon my ignorance, but where is the bug that called for something like
this? I can't say I love the idea of adding a bio list structure to the
tasklist, it feels pretty hacky. generic_make_request() doesn't really
use that much stack, if you just kill the BDEVNAME_SIZE struct.

generic_make_request() has always been where the unstacking has
happened, so yeah submit_bio() would not work.

That's correct, bi_next is only used for request chaining. So it's
available for free use by the stacking drivers up until they call
make_request on a bio.

There's nothing guaranteeing that a make_request would not do sync io.
