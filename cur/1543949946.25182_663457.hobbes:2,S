Actually, I have a list of possible projects online already:
http://kernelnewbies.org/KernelProjects
The list is on a wiki and "unfiltered", so we may need to look into the
quality of the proposals a bit more before Summer of Code, and/or accept
proposals by the Summer of Code volunteers and help them make sure their
proposals are useful.

Kernelnewbies is just a community of people, without much organization.
However, I would be happy to coordinate a group of mentors for Linux
kernel Summer of Code as well as be a mentor for the kernel subsystems
that I know something about.
If we can find mentors to cover most of the kernel (volunteers? anyone?),
we can do a good enough job of mentoring the students that we could sign
up for Summer of Code.
Summer of Code could also be a good way to get some kernel related work
done, for example LTP tests for kernel subsystems that do not have a
test suite yet.  Maybe not the most interesting work, but it can be very
educational as well as useful - that and $5000 may be enough to motivate
students to get some of this "boring work" done :)
