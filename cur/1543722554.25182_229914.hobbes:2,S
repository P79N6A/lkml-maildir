I see a list of these gcc bitop builtins at the bottom of the page:
  
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html
Looks like you can find the position of the first 1 bit, the length of
the leading or trailing seq of 0 bits, the hamming weight (popcount) and
the parity, each for int, long and long long.
I just add this for the benefit of others.
As to your primary question - is this worth doing - I don't have
an answer.
