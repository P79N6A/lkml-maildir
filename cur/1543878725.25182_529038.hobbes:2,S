It's not /dev he's backing up -- its /home, /usr, and others. GNU tar
saves the device and inode numbers from the {,l}stat() call on each file
and decides it is a new file if either number changes from run to run.
You are correct about /dev -- who'd back it up if it is dynamically
created? But that is also not the problem Gene is having.
