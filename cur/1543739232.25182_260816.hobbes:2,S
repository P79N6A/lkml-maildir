Can someone please put this patch into some context, where it's not 
completely pointless? As is it does not make anything more secure.
Why is the kernel more trustable than a kernel module?
If someone could show me how I can trust the running kernel, it should be 
rather easy to extend the same measures to modules without the need for 
this patch.
bye, Roman
