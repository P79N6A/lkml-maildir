On 200+ different laptops, with new ones coming out every day?
Don't be silly. The only way to test this is to have USERS test it.
And face it, users simply WILL NOT keep re-installing the system just to
test it. As such, the only way you get reasonable coverage is to just make
the installation use _exactly_ the same setup as any regular bootup event. 
That means: kernel command line options are _not_ acceptable in general,
for example. And configuration files are completely unacceptable, because
you don't have anything to set them up with.

AND THOSE TOOLS DO NOT EXIST WHEN INSTALLING! 
You can't expect a user to edit a text file before being able to read from
the CD. 
Ok, that's the last I'm going to bother with this issue.
