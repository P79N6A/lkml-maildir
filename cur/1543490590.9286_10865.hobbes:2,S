Ahh, okay, thanks for clearing this. Anyway, I know that Linux doesn't have
a problem with long uptimes, but pppd seems to ...
I was almost happy I found the bug in pppd that keeps biting me. The pppd
after some time of it running (several days) ceases to hear replies from the
other side to the LCP echo commands it sends and always hangs up after a
pre-defined time after making a connection (2 minutes). This continues until
I kill and restart pppd, which I use in the 'demand, persist' mode.
Have fun,
