I didn't ignore it; I answered it with a question!  If you had
answered mine, you'd have had the answer to yours ... :)
One way another task can be active during resume is with sysfs:
"echo -n 0 > /sys/devices/.../power/state", after similar selective
suspend of the device.  That's uncommon for now, primarily useful
for unit-testing driver suspend/resume.  Plus, its design is
currently borked; the pm core code doesn't bother to suspend
children of the device first.  But I do expect that selective
suspend/resume should work in Linux; it's not reasonable to design
the pm framework otherwise.
But in any case, while it'd be difficult to notice that mdelay()
in current systems (since selective suspend/resume is still rare)
it'd clearly be wrong to assume that resume() methods don't need
to have mutual exclusion during their critical sections.

I never suggested such a scenario.  Though that would be another
case where such critical sections matter, like the remove() method.

Which gets back to the question I asked you:  if not the lock in
question, what's ensuring that everything behaves right?
As I said originally, I don't much like long udelays, but
at least it's clearly correct in terms of mutual exclusion.
You've not shown any solution that's equivalently correct.
