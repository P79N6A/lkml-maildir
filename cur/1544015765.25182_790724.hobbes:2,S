2M of per cpu data doesn't make sense, and likely indicates a design
flaw somewhere.  It just doesn't make sense to have large amounts of
data allocated per cpu.
The most common user of per cpu data I am aware of is allocating one
word per cpu for counters.
What would be better is simply to: 
- Require a lock to access another cpus per cpu data.
- Do large page allocations for the per cpu data.
At which point we could grow the per cpu data by simply reallocating it on
each cpu and updating the register that holds the base pointer.
