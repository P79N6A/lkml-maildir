I agree, evolution is good in this case.  I'm just really curious as to
why Monta Vista and Intel decided that udev wasn't an approiate project
to work with, and decided to spend time and resources to develop an
alternative one.  Just a bit frustrated, as udev really could have used
a few people working on it full time as SDE had.
But hey, that's all past, if those companies like to live with the NIH
symptom, I can't change that.  And udev development will go on
regardless.

Agreed.

Different namespace where?  In /sys?  Or somewhere else?

Not true at all.  Just look at the device symlink, and the type file in
that directory.  Shows it quite well for all of my scsi devices.  Now it
looks like IDE needs to add that same type of file, but that's an IDE
issue.  Actually IDE's sysfs code probably could use some good cleanups,
now that I look at it some more.  Want to work on that?
thanks,
