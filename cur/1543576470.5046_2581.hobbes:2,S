Maybe set the new dual controller to be IDE 2,3 and have the SB32 as IDE4.
Also, you can check /proc/ioports and /proc/interrupts to see if there
actually are conflicts with the port ranges or interrupts of your card.
I'm guessing not, because it worked before, but you never know.
IDE cards actually have 2 port ranges, so it may be that with the new card
you are getting conflicts.  My system shows:
0170-0177 : ide1
01e8-01ef : ide2
01f0-01f7 : ide0
0376-0376 : ide1
03ee-03ee : ide2
03f6-03f6 : ide0
The second ide2 port is in the same place as ttyS2 (com3)...
Cheers, Andreas
