The Debian BTS [0] might be worth considering here too. It's used by at
least Debian, Gnome and KDE [1], and has both web (for viewing) and mail
(for manipulating and viewing) interfaces. Every bug gets forwarded via
email to the appropriate maintainer and a couple of mailing lists as
soon as its received, and added to the archives. It's GPLed for what
that's worth. There are a number of tools to make bug reporting and
viewing easier (reportbug.deb and bug.deb come to mind) and it's also
a fairly well tested and reliable system.
It's designed to handle lots of small programs though, rather than one
big project with lots of inter-related modules though.

Debian uses "wishlist" bug reports for this, more or less (bug fixes get
normal priority, security fixes get critical priority). For most bugs,
it works pretty well --- you can send a feature request, and add patches
/ comments or whatever. When the maintainer uploads a fixed version,
they close the report. Having the bug reports go to various mailing lists
also helps this.
Too much discussion really doesn't work that well though --- the important
points get lost in the discussion so if you just want to find out the key
points from some month old bug report, it becomes pretty painful. The
archived discussion also isn't threaded, which can be a pain in these
cases.
Cheers,

I don't speak for anyone save myself. PGP encrypted mail preferred.
