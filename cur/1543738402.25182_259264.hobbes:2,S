2.4 used to scan the ISA PnP device ID string for some common substrings 
indicating a modem given a completely unknown ISA PnP device (the code 
is still present -- see drivers/serial/8250_pnp.c:check_name()) while 
2.6 really needs your modem's PnP ID to be listed.

8250_pnp not finding it is therefore very likely a simple matter of it 
not knowing that it should be driving it. Try seeing if your modem's PnP 
ID (/sys/bus/pnp/devices/?/id) is listed in drivers/serial/8250_pnp.c 
and if not add it (and send as a patch to Russel King).
8250 itself finding it was no doubt due to you enabling the port 
yourself so that from its standpoint, it was just another serial port 
already present. With your modem's ID added, 8250_pnp should find and 
activate the mdem itself without you needing to do anything other than 
"modprobe 8250_pnp"
Hope that helps.
Rene.
