by the way and just for the record, dave, you have the above
completely backwards.  the default for what you would be allowed to
select or deselect would be *everything*.  what this whole maturity
level thing would allow you to do is selectively *deselect* (or
*filter*) what is displayed.  in short, if you do nothing, you see no
effect.
so i don't mind folks criticizing the proposal.  but it sure would be
nice if they understood what they were criticising, know what i mean?
