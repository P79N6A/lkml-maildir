in __bdevname.  It shouldn't try the get_gendisk.  I introduced that long
ago, but it's wrong.  Use bdevname where you can, else we can't do much
else than printing the namjor/minor sanely.
The packet writing code should always use bdevname() (see my previous
mail on how to get there), and here's a patch to fix __bdevname:
