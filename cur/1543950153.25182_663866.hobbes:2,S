No, we don't plan on doing that. What we plan on doing is
1. Specify the mount point for each controller
2. In the create group API, specify the name of the group and the various
parameters.
If for example CPU is mounted at /cpu and Memory at /mem
Then a specification for creation of group A would be of the form
create_group(A, cpu=100, memory=100M)
Then,
/cpu/A has shares set to 100 and /mem/A has memory.limit set to 100M
If you want to create subgroups under A, you specify
create_group(A/B, memory=200M, cpu=50)
That would create /cpu/A/B and /mem/A/B
Please note that memory and CPU hierarchy needs work in the kernel. The shares
and hierarchy support is pending. We need to make the res_counters
infrastructure aware of hierarchies.
