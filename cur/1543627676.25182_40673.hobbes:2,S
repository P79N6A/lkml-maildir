Quite frankly, since after several months of being broken, nobody has
stepped up to actually fix it, I am most definitely going to accept the
band-aid solutions to SCSI drivers that will thus only work on x86.
"Not acceptable" is when broken drivers means that people can't test the 
features they _care_ about. Apparently nobody seems to care about the SCSI 
driver itself..
