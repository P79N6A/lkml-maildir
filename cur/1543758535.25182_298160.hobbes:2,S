I backed the bk-pci.patch out, and it started working again, so the problem is
somewhere in there (progress - we've got it down to one 5,500 patch ;).
Perhaps related, the following compile warnings also went away:
   CC [M]  drivers/ieee1394/ohci1394.o

drivers/pcmcia/rsrc_nonstatic.c:676: warning: passing arg 7 of `allocate_resource' from incompatible pointer type
I'm suspicious of the warnings for rsrc_nonstatic.o, because we end up in that
exact piece of code just before failing with the 'unable to map card memory'
message. Maybe that arg 7 is causing us to pass a stack that doesn't quite
match what's expected, and thus the bug?
