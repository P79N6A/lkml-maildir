Krzysztof and Ueimor,
	Following the advice prescribed below, I've had a look at existing
HDLC work in the kernel.  I tried firing up a Riscom/N2 adapter with the
2.4.28 N2 module and HDLC support but was faced with a number of problems.
It seems like the transmit buffers aren't getting emptied after transmit,
because I can only transmit a few frames before traffic halts.  Transmit
statistics don't increment either, but I am seeing frames on the remote end.
	Has the N2 module been tested with recent kernels?  Is it useable?
If not, which module will show me the genius of the Linux HDLC "stack"?
-AA

It will probably require a few extra steps:
- read Documentation/CodingStyle (mixed case, typedef from hell, ugly
#ifdef);
- grep ^static
  -> no static functions ? Uh ?
- use non-obsolete API (pci_find_device in 2005 ?);
- convert the os independant wrappers.
Btw it would probably make sense 1) to figure out what can be merged with
the in-tree DSCC4 driver and 2) to integrate the driver with the existing
hdlc stack. Imho there is some duplicated work/code.
