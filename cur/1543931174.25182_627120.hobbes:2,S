It can't be done in userspace, otherwise someone using the cachefilesd
interface can pass an arbitrary context up.  The security context has to be
passed across the file descriptor attached to /dev/cachefiles along with the
other configuration parameters as a text string.  This fd selects the
particular cache context that a particular instance of a running daemon is
using.
