See other email from Kyle on how to dpkg reconfigure. I submitted a bug report 
to debian years ago about this and I presume it was fixed but you've probably 
slowly dist upgraded from an older version and it stayed in your config?

Progress at last! And without any patches! Well those look very reasonable to 
me. Especially since -j5 is a worst case scenario.

But would you say it's still _adequate_ with ccache considering you only have 
1/6th cpu left for X? With and without ccache it's quite a different workload 
so they will behave differently.

That part I don't know about. You've only tested the difference with X running 
nice -10. I need to look further at the mechanism for -nice tasks. It should 
be possible to run smoothly even with a -niced X (although that was never my 
intent) so perhaps that's not working properly. I'll look into that.
Thanks!
