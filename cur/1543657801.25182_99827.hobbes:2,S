I think if anything, you are stating the true value of the
microbenchmarks.  They are showing us how the kernel is getting
more and more complex, causing basic operations to take longer
and longer.  That's bad. :-)
Last time I brought up an issue like this (a "nobody but weirdos use
feature which is costing us cycles everywhere"), it got redone until
it did cost nothing for people who don't use the feature.  See the
whole security layer fiasco for example.
I truly wish I could config out AIO for example, the overhead is just
stupid.  I know that if some thought is put into it, the cost could
be consumed completely.
People who don't see the true value of researching even minor jitters
in lmbench results (and fixing the causes or backing out the guilty
patch) aren't kernel developers in my opinion. :-)
