If I write some code and that code becomes a critical part of the linux 
kernel and my code is GPLv3 then no one could use Linux unless they 
removed my code. (And all GPLv3 code) - Thus the inclusion of GPLv3 code 
would force the whole kernel to be effectively GPLv3. Unless Linus says 
nothing gets included unless it's GPLv2.

In this context Linux compatible means a license that Linus is happy with.

Yes - so perhaps GPLv3 is not Linux compatible. If so - then GPLv3 needs 
to be changed or excluded.

Lawyers of big corporations. Greedy decendents who pull an SCO.

But if the Kernel contains GPLv3 code then that part of the kernel is 
subject to those restrictions. If the code is critical then it 
affectively makes Linux subjet to GPLv3. Perhaps the only way to avoid 
that is to require the same license for all kernel code?

When lawyers get involved there is no such thing as a dead issue ..... sigh!
