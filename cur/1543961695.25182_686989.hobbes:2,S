Yes.  The Linux process is becoming unreliable.  Newly "stable" versions
have stability problems.  The development process looks childish. 
Seasoned developers say not to worry, that the process works.  I do
worry.  BSD seems more attractive, and it may even be worth the
considerable effort to switch my entire client-base.  Linux was lucky to
gain the foothold that it did: traditionally, BSD had a better system
with a less restrictive licence, so it is surprising that manufacturers
chose to go with Linux.  BSD still has a less restrictive licence and
when mainstream press becomes interested in Linux's quality problems
it's adoption will fall.  BSD is still a good, maybe even better, option.
Linus, this is your baby and so it's your problem.  Only you have the
influence to change things.
