Yes I have tought it all through!
Please trust me - I eat at least myself my dog-food.
And the driver_init function is something which where currently
just the bloody module initialization function get's called
a seond time - and this is just plain wrong.
If I hadn't tought about it I wouldn't be that advantegrous.
And my testing of it did consist of the following:
1. 2 x IDE drives of one IDE port.
2. 1 x CD-RW on a second port - modularized.
3. 1 x CarBus to CF adapter.
It all worked well after the removal!
