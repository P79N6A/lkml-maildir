This is acceptable for a single machine. I do have something similar
(though mostly read-only and with home dirs on NFS) at home as an
always-on browser. But managing a lot of remote machines that way is
often a difficult work, and the risk of losing remote machines increases
with the number of machines, the frequency of updates and the write
rates on the flash.
Packaging an easily upgradable and remotely testable system really
is worth it even for a few tens of machines.
Cheers,
Willy
