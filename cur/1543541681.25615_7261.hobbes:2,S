	Umm... Quite a few LISP interpreters are using the following data
structure: list of pairs <name, arbitrary value>. Normally such a beast is
associated with every name and is used to store the stuff like "value of
variable", "definition of function", etc. It is often used to represent
an equivalent of structures and objects (as in "OOP"), BTW. P in P-list
stands for properties. When all your environment is written in LISP...
Well, idea of persistent storage for such beasts becomes very natural.
That's where this stuff came from. Yes, you can have your whole OS/GUI/IDE
in LISP. Proof: Genera. Nice beast, but... absolutely unsuitable as a
multiuser system. Having that _under_ multiuser OS (with less archaic
functional language at core) would be wonderful. But it would be per-user
thing and its storage would _live_ on filesystem, not _be_ a
shared filesystem. I would certainly like to have such an animal as a
desktop...
	Trying to force the forks into the OS built on fundamentally
different ideas is just plain silly. Making them visible to the hosting OS
as a bunch of filesystem objects? Sure, why not. But trying to bend
the filesystem semantics just to make them look like single fs objects...
Damn stupid.
	BTW, the desktop crowd would do much better if they would start
with making the X objects hierarchy visible as a userland fs. That would
allow much simpler integration of CLI stuff and normal programs in 
general. Filesystem is The API on UNIX and all UNIX userland is built to
work with it. Exporting your functionality via that API rather than
inventing incompatible kludery would be really nice thing. Sigh...
