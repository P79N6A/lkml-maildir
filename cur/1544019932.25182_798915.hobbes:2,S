My view of what's "wrong" with that approach is that it requires root
privileges to boost the scheduling priority of each and every process
(although in this case, mplayer is the issue) which I want to not be
affected by foldingathome's CPU usage.  While I happen to be root on
this system, since it is my desktop, I would imagine there are instances
where the root user/administrator of a system wanted to be able to run
items which had no impact on other users, including allowing them to run
fast and responsive applications.  Aside from that, it's a PITA to start
mplayer playing, go renice -19 it and resume watching my movie every
time.

I want it to be able to run in the background without my having to
intervene, but I want the core which shares mplayer to starve
foldingathome until my movie is over :-).
