Hi,
Here is the patch again for the benefit of those who are allergic to
opening enclosures.
I believe it will only take about 30 seconds of "real thinking" for those
familiar with dev.c to make
an evaluation of the patch.
Those already familiar with the bug can skip this paragraph,
The bug fixes a problem that occurs if register_netdev gets called before
net_dev_init the dev->refcnt gets incremented to 2 after net_dev_init is
called
& unregister_netdev will loop forever.
The  following additional lines at the top of register_netdev will call
net_dev_init
if it hasn't already been called & by doing this I'm able to remove about
20 lines of special
case code in this function.
+    if (dev_boot_phase)
+         net_dev_init();
The following additional lines in net_dev_init will do a quick exit if this
routine
as already been called ( as may be done from register_netdev ).
+    if(!dev_boot_phase)
+         return 0;
