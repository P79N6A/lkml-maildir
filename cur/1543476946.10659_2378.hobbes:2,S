  Was the partition with ext2 really /dev/hda3? I don't suppose the SB
could get corrupted by these operations. I think there simply isn't any
ext2 superblock on /dev/hda3. The stamp in partition table is only for
users and AFAIK nobody cares about it. If /dev/hda3 is really ext2 partition
the fsck has option to read superblock from other block than the first
(SB is copied in the beggining of each group which is usually 8 MB long).

  I also haven't heard of any problems so far..
