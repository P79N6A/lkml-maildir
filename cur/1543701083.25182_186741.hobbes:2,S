I can't get my Microsoft wheel mouse to work left-handed via USB or PS/2 
adaptor.
This is with 2.6.0 and KDE from RH9.  I can only manage to get both 
buttons to
be seen as right-handed mb3 or "normal" right-handed, i.e. mb1 and mb3.  
I do
want to run 2.6.0, but I can't!  Any ideas?  (of course it all works 
fine with 2.4.23).
