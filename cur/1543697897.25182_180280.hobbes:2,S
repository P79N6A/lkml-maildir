Sure, I just mean the semantics should be equivalent to a read write
loop. Another example is zero copy copy for a remote fs that supports
it.

Well it would be implementation specific. Presumably it should keep
the semantics of an overwrite.

I don't think it should do any linking / unlinking it should just work
with file descriptors. Concurrent writes to a file don't have many
guarantees. sys_copy shouldn't have to be any stronger (read weaker).

No I just mean the semantics.
