For any non-ancient gcc and !alpha, we are already telling gcc via 
__attribute__((always_inline)) that it should abort compilation if it 
can't inline the function.
The problem is that "extern inline" gives warnings with 
-Wmissing-prototypes, and I want to add this flag to the CFLAGS since it 
helps us to avoid a class of nasty runtime errors.
