David, sorry I didn't know that your patch is fundamentally different from
Zoltan's. I will now re-test with your patch and see if it makes my
eepro100 "instabilities" go away.
The performance problems went away as I said earlier, by fiddling with
cache settings in the BIOS. (with and without Zoltan's patch my machine is
now as fast as it can be)
Regards,
Tigran
