Hi.
I'd downloaded the 2.4 kernel with svn and built it yesterday. Now I'm
trying to update it and I'm getting this ...
$ svn update
svn: No such file or directory
svn: svn_io_copy_file: error copying
'arch/ia64/scripts/.svn/text-base/check-gas-for-hint.S.svn-base' to
'arch/ia64/scripts/.svn/tmp/text-base/check-gas-for-hint.S.svn-base.tmp'
$
Is anyone else seeing this?
