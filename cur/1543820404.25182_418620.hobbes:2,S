Don't discount exceptions so fast. They're exactly what makes the code 
clearer and more robust.
A very large proportion of error handling consists of:
- detect the error
- undo local changes (freeing memory and unlocking spinlocks)
- propagate the error
Exceptions make that fully automatic. The kernel uses a mix of gotos and 
alternate returns which bloat the code and are incredibly error prone. 
See the recent 2.6.16.x for examples.

They only seem relocatable with your C glasses on. Put on your C++ 
glasses (much thicker), and initialization no longer seems trivially 
movable.
On the other hand, you can replace the C code
{
    Foo item1, item2;
    int r;
    spin_lock(&foo_lock);
    if ((r = foo_init(&item1)) < 0) {
        spin_unlock(&foo_lock);
        return r;
    }
    if ((r = foo_init(&item2)) < 0) {
        foo_destroy(&item1);
        spin_unlock(&foo_lock);
        return r;
    }
    foo_destroy(&item2);
    foo_destroy(&item1);
    spin_unlock(&foo_lock);
    return 0;
}
with
{
    spinlock_t::guard foo_guard(foo_lock);
    Foo item1;
    Foo item2;
}
14 lines vs 3, one variable eliminated. How many potential security 
vulnerabilities? How much time freed to work on the algorithm/data 
structure, not on error handling?

It isn't. It's nice for other application domains (matrix algebra, etc.) 
not for kernels.
This mailing list has a full complement of reviewers who can detect 
trailing whitespace in a dark room three miles away. Surely they can 
spot an attempt to sneak in the "operator" keyword.

Not all C++ features need to be used in the kernel. In fact, not all C++ 
features need to be used, period. Ever tried to understand code which 
uses overloaded operator,() (the comma operator)?
