Spamassassin is slow if you call it at every message cause the Perl
startup and init is quite expensive. If you run the spamassassin daemon
(spamd) and use the spamassassin client (spamc) it's a lot faster.
Over here it can cope with lots of mailing list traffic and even more
spam (>30000 messages a day on an Athlon 2400+).
