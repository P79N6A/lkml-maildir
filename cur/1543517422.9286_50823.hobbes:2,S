Well this is all wonderful, but there can only be one CPU per task at
any one instant in time. If there are two CPUs mucking with the same
task, something other than the demo code is broken.
If you look at the code, it doesn't give a damn what the result of
"pars->spin += key" is, as long as it can be undone with "pars->spin -=
key". Further, 'key' is local to a task. It doesn't care what the
value is as long as it's non-zero.
Further, the cli and sti macros are not even necessary. They were
just added (along with iopl) in an attempt to verify the problem
Neither neither "pars->spin" nor "pars->key" can be partially updated
before an interrupt occurs. They can be interrupted before or after
the summation, but not in the middle. The code purposely increments
and decrements the shared-memory variable, and will do it continually
until a point is found where there is no CPU contention. That is
the purpose of it. It is expected that there will be lots of loops
through the code where both the child and the parent are mucking with
the same variable. When this is discovered, the contenders subtract
their keys and sleep for a 'random' period of time so resolve the
deadlock.
The problem is not that deadlocks occasionally occur. The problem
is that, on a SMP machine, what was written by one CPU does not
appear in shared memory when viewed by another CPU. This is a bug.
