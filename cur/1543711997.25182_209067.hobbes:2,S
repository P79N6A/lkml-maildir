It is different because the heart of ksoftirqd - do_softirq() is
run with local_bh_disable(). Sure, you get chances to preempt
there, but not as much as krcud which runs completely in process
context. Of course, it depends on how long we stay with
softirqs disabled in do_softirq().

Yes. BTW, throttle-rcu too can't avoid route cache overflow under
DoS stress test. Different problem, but I just wanted to mention
this. I will publish those results separately.

That was not 16 callbacks per tick, it was 16 callbacks in one
batch of a single softirq. And then I reschedule the RCU tasklet
to process the rest. I am planning to vary this and see if we
should do even less per softirq.

Needs more testing with other workloads. I will have some more results
with the tiny files test.
