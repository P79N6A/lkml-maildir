Looks like you're requesting the wrong interrupt, 217 is the one your 
device is actually on. You always have to request the interrupt listed 
in the PCI device structure. If you're looking at your PCI device's 
configuration registers to get the IRQ to request, that's wrong, since 
that is configured by the BIOS assuming PIC IRQ routing, but APIC IRQ 
routing is entirely different.
