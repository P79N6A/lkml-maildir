okay, the first thing I see is:
-getgid32()                              = 500
-getuid32()                              = 500
+getgid32()                              = 0
+getuid32()                              = 0

 stat64("/var/", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0

They appear to either not be running in equivalent environments or
something has gone horribly wrong. The diff is incredibly noisy and not
useful for debugging, could you strace the working kernel's bit as root?
Also, things start getting wildly different after both examine DB_CONFIG,
where 2.4 and 2.5 open different files with different options, i.e. 2.5
does O_DIRECT on /var/lib/rpm/__db.001 and 2.4 never touches that file,
and 2.4 never does O_DIRECT either.
This may very well have something to do with the difference in
privileges.
