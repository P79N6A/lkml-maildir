I've put up 2.2.13pre6. There are a couple of small things to go in (PPC
strnlen_user etc) but other than that I don't plan to add anything else
but obvious bug fixes to this. It has two weeks to settle down while Linus
has a break.
I'd like to get to the bottom of the SMP sound/floppy bug and some of the
other longer standing oddities but thats it. If we have a rock solid 2.2.13
then knfsd updates can go into 2.2.14.
