I did a binary search. 2.4.10-pre10 is the last good kernel. I got
# hdparm -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.40 seconds = 14.55 MB/sec
Even since 2.4.10-pre11 up to 2.4.16, I got about 1.77 MB/sec on the
same hardware. However, I don't have problems with 80GB IDE HD. Has
anyone seen I/O problems on large (>= 80GB) SCSI HD or HD with SCSI
emulation?
