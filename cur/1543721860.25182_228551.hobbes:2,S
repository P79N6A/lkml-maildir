Thanks.  Actually there's still a critical flaw in the set_con2fbmap code.  
For one, con2fb_map is never initialized.  It's just fortunate that this 
array happens to be  filled with zeroes so con2fb_map[n] will always return 
zero and registered_fb[0] happens to contain a valid info.  So it works, by 
accident. 
Secondly, if you load fbdev1, load fbdev2, unload fbdev1, load fbcon, the 
console will freeze. This is because fbdev1, which is originally in 
registered_fb[0], is now unloaded, and fbdev2, which is in registered_fb[1] 
is still loaded.  However, fbcon looks at registered_fb[0] during init.
Also, I really don't like the take_over_console part in set_con2fbmap.  Too 
many unknowns. 
There are still lot more problems which I won't mention. I'll try to fix some 
of them over this weekend.
