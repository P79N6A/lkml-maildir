I can't see whole 8GB of ram.
With F2 BIOS release i can only work with kernel param mem=4G.
After updating to F4 BIOS release I can work with mem=8G, but I see this:
# free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          6473        474       5999          0         29        278
Without mem=8G kernel starts to slow down and hangs while starting 
filesystem.
There is no message.
My whole memory was tested with memtest. Full test took about 48hour. Is 
it wrong?
I have:  Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU @ 2.40GHz
There are 4   *  2GB / 667MHz DIMMs.

I can see that higer memory range was remmaped,
by why accesing something greater than 100000000 is problematic?
Do I need to change something i kernel configuration?
