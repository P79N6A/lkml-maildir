Hi,
I'm trying to set up an IPv6 network in Linux kernel 2.4.0-test10. In this
network I'm using just 3 boxs and I would use static routes.
 _____        _____          _____
|   A   |____|    B   | ____|   C   |     
|_____|       |_____|        |_____|
The problem is that I cannot access from A to C machines and vice-versa. But
the routing problem is a bit strange because, A can access to the two
interfaces of B, even to B interface in the same network as C. Also C can
access to both B interfaces and cannot access to machine A.
i.e. the machines seems that can access to other networks (the routing
mechanisms seems work fine), but B cannot be able to forward the packet. Is
this correct ?
Anybody know if I have a missconfiguration or I'm doing somethings wrong ?
Regards.
