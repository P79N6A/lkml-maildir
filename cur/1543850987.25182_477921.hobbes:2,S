If the file system uses the generic page cache functions for reading and
writing, it should be able to use the generic splice read/write
functions as well. If it doesn't, then more work is likely involved. In
short, check the .read/.write and .aio_read/.aio_write parts of the
file_operations[] structure. jfs uses the generic handlers, hence splice
support should just be the two-liner posted.
