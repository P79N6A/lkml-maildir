BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!
the odd thing is the system experiences a hard lockup,
so it is not a false positive. I am working on a
trace, but it is hard to get.
My supervisor has asked me to help research this
problem. We are using multiple ata cards in our backup
machine. We have a Promiss sata 300tx4, and three ATA
cards (3 SIG UltraATA 133 PCI) or (3 promise ultra
100tx2). We are experiencing hard lockups. The system
resides on a scsi drive connected to the on board
controler Adaptec AIC-7899P (Tyan S2462
motherboard)the error is repeated for all drives
connected to the promis cards, and the error continues
until a lock up is eventualy reached.
Also, its in dma mode, not pio.
PREEMPT_NONE is already set, so its not the preemption
model
