Pthread_spin_lock() under the NPTL version in RH9 does basically what my custom locks do in the uncontested case, aside from the function call.  But remember that this began with a discussion about whether it was reasonable for user locking code to explicitly yield rather than relying on pthreads to suspend the thread.  I don't think pthread_spin_lock is relevant in this context, for two reasons:
1) At least the RH9 version of pthread_spin_lock in NPTL literally spins and makes no attempt to yield or block.  This only makes sense at user level if you are 100% certain that the processors won't be overcommitted.  Otherwise there is little to be lost by blocking once you have spun for sufficiently long.  You could use pthread_spin_trylock and block explicitly, but that gets us back to custom blocking code.
2) AFAICT, pthread_spin_lock is currently a little too bleeding edge to be widely used.  I tried to time it, but failed.  Pthread.h doesn't include the declaration for pthread_spin_lock_t by default, at least not yet.  It doesn't seem to have a Linux man page, yet.  I tried to define the magic macro to get it declared, but that broke something else.
