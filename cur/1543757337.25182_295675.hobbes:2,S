Well, whether you POST video or not is still only
software... anyway...
Your _WAK idea could work for notebooks (but if you did it in _WAK
you'd break windows, so you'd have to call it _VWK (VideoWaK) or
something), but for desktop where user can plug in any video card he
buys... I do not see how you can get away with something other than
normal POST.
