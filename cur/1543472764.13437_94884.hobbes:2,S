Has anyone else noticed any issues with accessing serial ports with the 
2.1.132preX kernels?  I have software that backs up my palmpilot, it's worked 
fine until recently when I've been installing the 2.1.132preX kernels (have 
tried pre1 and pre4 so far).
The mouse works fine, so serial support seems to work, but the kernel is the 
only thing that has changed.
