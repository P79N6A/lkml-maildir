It _is_ fragile, but for a number of POSIX-defined structs that's  
actually the only way to do it without duplicating the data structure  
in entirety, unless the GCC people can implement a "typedef struct  
foo struct bar;"  Hopefully it would be a relatively rare occurrence  
and carefully thought out in any case.  We may end up with some  
duplication regardless :-\.
