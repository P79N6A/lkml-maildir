Subject: [PATCH] 2.2.18 ext2 large file bug?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello,
while looking at the COMPAT flag patches I made, I noticed the following
in the ext2/ext3 code.  I believe that this bug is fixed in 2.4, but it
also needs to be fixed in 2.2.  Basically, we are checking for an ext2
large file, which would be a file > 2GB on systems that don't support
such.  However, we are checking for a file > 8GB which is clearly wrong.
The ext3 version of the patch is also attached.
Cheers, Andreas
