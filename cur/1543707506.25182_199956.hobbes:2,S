Actually, not necessarily.  What if Samba gets notifications of all
filename renames and creates in the directory, so that after the
initial directory scan, it can keep track of what filenames are
present in the directory?  It can then "prove the negative", as you
put it, without having to continuously do directory scans.
Yeah, there can be some race conditions, but Samba already has to deal
with the race condition where it tries to create "MaKeFiLe" either
just before or just after a Posix process creates "Makefile".
