Your real life or mine as developer?
I fortunately do not know anything about your real life, but my real life
applications can be found on project's homepage.
There is a link to archive there, where you can find plenty of sources.
You likely do not know, but it is a bit risky business to patch all
existing applications to show that approach is correct, if
implementation is not completed.
You likely do not know, but after I first time announced kevents in
February I changed interfaces 4 times - and it is just interfaces, not
including numerous features added/removed by developer's requests.

Answer is trivial - there is archive where one can find a source code
(filenames are posted regulary). Should I create a rpm? For what glibc
version?

iproute documentation was way too bad when Alexey presented it first

Btw, show me splice() 'shiny' application? Does lighttpd use it?
Or move_pages().

There are always people who do not like something, what can I do with
it? I present the code, we discuss it, I ask for inclusion (since it is
the only way to get feedback), something requires changes, it is changed
and so on - it is development process.
I created 'little animal in the open source zoo' by myself to show how
simple kevents are.

As I already told several times, I changed only interfaces 4 times
already, since no one seems to know what we really want and how
interface should look like. You suggest to patch lighttpd? Well, it is
doable, but then I will be asked to change apache and nginx. And then
someone will suggest to change order of parameters. Will you help me
rewrite userspace? No, you will not. You asks for something without
providing anything back (not getting into account code, but discussion,
ideas, testing time, nothing), and you do it in ultimate manner.
Btw, kevent also support AIO notifications - do you suggest to patch
reactor/proactor for tests?
It supports network AIO - do you suggest to write support for that into
apache?
What about timers? It is possible to rewrite all POSIX timers users to
usem instead.
There is feature request for userspace events and singal delivery - what
to do with that?
I created trivial web servers, which send single static page and use
various event handling schemes, and I test new subsystem with new tools,
when tests are completed and all requested features are implemented it
is time to work on different more complex users.
So let's at least complete what we have right now, so no developer's
efforts could be wasted writing empty chars in various places.
