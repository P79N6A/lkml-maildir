With the current tree no. The work around is to make input api keyboards
behave as PS/2 keyboards. In 2.5.X ps2 keyboards will be input api based. 
As you can see we already have PS/2 input api driver (i8042.c and atkbd.c). 
I have been using it for several months now. It is just a matter of making
sure it works on other platforms besides intel. 
P.S
   I also need to port other keyboard drivers on other platforms over to
the input api and test these drivers. If anyone would like to help out
contact me.
