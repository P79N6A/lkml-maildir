Subject: [PATCH 2/2] GFP_ZONETYPES calculate from GFP_ZONEMASK
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

GFP_ZONETYPES calculate from GFP_ZONEMASK
GFP_ZONETYPES's value is directly related to the value of GFP_ZONEMASK. 
It takes one of two forms depending whether the top bit of GFP_ZONEMASK
is a 'loner'.  Supply both forms, enabling the loner.
