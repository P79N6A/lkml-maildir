Depends on how you look at it.

True, but shouldn't the kernel just panic and halt? A spontaneous
reboot is a bit.. unnerving, and makes it hard to diagnose what happened.
But anyway I have no idea what the kernel does if init dies. If it
just treats is as a "never happens" situation it might die horribly..
BTW,  Init _never_ does an exit(). Even if it gets SIGSEGV it prints
a message and does a "while(1) pause()" forever.
