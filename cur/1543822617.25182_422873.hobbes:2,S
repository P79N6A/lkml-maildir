Sometimes a serial capture is easier to log, but you don't really need to
do it.  That's up to you.

Hmm, I'm starting to think that this is not really a problem with the -rt
implementation, and my earlier patch to turn off the BUG dump, is OK.
What RT prio is the network interrupt at?
What seems to be happening is that the vortex_timer is going off while the
interrupt is running.  Hence the disable_irq fails and schedules.
Perhaps the interrupt thread has been preempted by some high priority task
and causes it to lose a connection.
Yeah that task output would be helpful to see if you can get it to work.
Also can you show us the output of /proc/interrupts so we know which
threads are associated to the network card interrupt, and see where they
are.
