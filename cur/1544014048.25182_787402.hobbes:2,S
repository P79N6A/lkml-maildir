Hi Milton/Stephen,
	Sorry for resending the patch before taking care of the response. Resending 
the patch with changes made to other three drivers also.
Impact: Fix the VIOPATH dependency in the iSeries dependent drivers.
iSeries depend drivers build fails, when CONFIG_VIOPATH is disabled.
Removing the dependency of VIOPATH by selecting it, when the drivers
dependent on iSeries code.
