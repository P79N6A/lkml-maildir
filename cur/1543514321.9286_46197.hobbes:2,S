I'm experiencing the same problem with vanila 2.2.13.  This occurs with
the ide-scsi emulation, however.  After mounting a cdrom with ide-scsi
emulation turned on and accessing files I get the following errors:
Oct 24 18:55:09 beached2 kernel: 0b:01: rw=0, want=653324, limit=576634

this continues until the drive is unmounted.   I have never recieved
errors like this with previous kernels.
