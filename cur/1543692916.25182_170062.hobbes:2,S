Don't you see the flaw in your argumentation?
If lsof/fuser don't always handle this situation correctly you provide a
way for some ill-minded person to hide file descriptors from the view of
sysadmins etc.  You in any case have to handle this case.
It should be possible for a program to easily check whether
  /proc/PID/fd
and
  /proc/self/fd
are the same directory.  If not, add support for that.  Then those
programs only need to iterate over the fd directories and check whether
they are the same.
