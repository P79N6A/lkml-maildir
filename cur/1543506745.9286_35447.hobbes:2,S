Hi all,

BUT ...  The APM code got "hacked" in 2.3.13 (not by me) and probably doesn't
work at all at the moment.  I am trying to find time to send  Linus
a patch that gets it back to where it was.
In particular, the check that protected SMP systems from running
APM (except for power off) was moved and I haven't had time to
figure out how it should be fixed.
Cheers,
