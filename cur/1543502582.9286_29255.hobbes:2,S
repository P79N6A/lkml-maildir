Yep
Your server has probably been bouncing mail or something. If this
happens a lot, majordomo will guess that your e-mail-address has died, 
and will stop sending you mail.
You will probably need to resubscribe.
In the future, you could try sending such emails to
linux-kernel-owner@vger.rutgers.edu.
