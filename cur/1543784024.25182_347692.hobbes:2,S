You would be right if I was designing this right now. Now roll 10 - 12
years back and now I have a shiny new alpha. Would you criticize me
then for using a mechanism that allowed easily spread application
across several nodes with minimal changes if needed?
What you fail to realize that there applications that run and will
continue to run for a long time.

routines are not readily available - DLM starts looking much more
viable.
