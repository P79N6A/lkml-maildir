I have a MSI-6195 slot-A , AMD chipset with a visiontek nvidia vanta 32mb agp
card, RH 7.1 installed. I have experienced complete system lockups with random
uptimes < 1 day to 4 days, no mouse, keyboard, VCs, can't even telnet in or
ping. I finally made the connection it was happening when I was away from the
box and not using it interactively, which lead me to xscreensaver and sure
enough after I disabled it, no more lockups, up 30 days now. But I haven't
figured what in xscreensaver is doing this, don't know if it might be kernel
related or not, probably not. I suspect xscreensaver is triggering something in
the xserver that is not normally getting hit in normal use.
