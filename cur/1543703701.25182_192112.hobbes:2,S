I doubt. I have module which uses templates to get support for
couple of possible userspace interfaces which existed over time,
and it works very well, without any changes to the kernel headers. Only
thing I had to do was:
#ifdef __cplusplus
#  define new new_member
#  define private private_member
#  define namespace namespace_member
#endif
and extern "C" around #includes.
Of course that it is possible to do everything what templates do with
#define, but why do that in complicated ways if it can be done much
simpler?
Of course this module does not use exceptions or rtti, just templates
and static class members.
Module compiles on 2.2.0 to 2.6.1, with gcc 2.95-3.4. If you'll limit
yourself to gcc-3.0 or later, you do not have to worry about ::/: : at all,
as gcc's c++ parser gets it right after 2.95.
