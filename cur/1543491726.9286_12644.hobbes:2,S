Hi!
 I currently enter into the following problem:
 After powering up my linux box and logging in etc. it
 is not possible to connect "at once" to my ISP. Fireing up
 the pppd the first time after switching on the box means
 the modem goes on hook but does not dial. I can hear the
 "please dial"-tone :-) but nothing else.
 Killing chat and trying a second time succeeds. Cause my father
 is using the same modem on an Windows 98 computer and has not 
 those problems, I think a PnP-sequence is missing at boot time.
 When booting WIndows 98 I cann see the computer talking to the modem
 (flickering LEDs).
 I am willing to write such an init-program for at least my kind of
 modem, but I have no informations about PnP-talks via RS232.
 Does anyone out there encountered the same problems? 
 Does anyone out there has informations regarding a PnP-protocoll
 via RS232?
 My soft-/hardware:
 Linux v2.2.5  (what else? :o)
 pppd 2.3.7    (same problems with 2.3.3!)
 US-Robotics Sportster Flash modem (upgraded via flash to be 56k-able, V90)
 Any help is very appreciated
 Thank you very much in advance!
 KEEP HACKING!
