Some distro shutdown scripts must be doing "halt -h" at shutdown time.
-n : don't sync cache (default is to sync)
-h : put harddrives in standby (default is no standby)
And BTW not put them in sleep instead of standby (whether it's
the halt program or the kernel?) They won't wake up from that
until they're reset.
