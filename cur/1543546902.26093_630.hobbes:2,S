What you're saying is "there are other ways to accomplish this". And I
kind of agree. I still think the dynamic mask is the preferable option.

Sure. Another ELF marker, whatever. It would work, and probably cover the
needs. Especially as "the needs" aren't that big, as this has actually
never come up except as a theoretical discussion ;).
However, I just don't like it. We could do a lot of binary flags, but in
the end we should avoid doing it unless it is _really_ really needed. I
don't think it is. I'd much rather have a plain executable format, and
dynamic ways of making that executable do things differently.

Now THIS I agree with. Good notion - I like "unshare(CLONE_xxx)" as a
system call. I just wouldn't overload it with "clone()" (ie I'd make it a
new system call), because I'm just too attached to the fact that "clone()"
applies the bitmask on the _new_ thread and leaves the old thread
untouched. Changing the current thread is a fundamentally different
things, I think. And is worth a special system call.
That would indeed make my execve() flag totally unnecessary - and allows
for unsharing even without the execve().
Color me convinced.
