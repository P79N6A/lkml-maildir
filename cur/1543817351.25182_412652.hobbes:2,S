It comes close the but capabilities are not currently factored correctly.

Exactly.  You can define the semantics with a security module,
but you cannot define the semantics in terms of uids.

Nothing controlled by sysctl has a capable check, except
the capabilities sysctl.  The default if not the norm is not
to apply capability checks.

Yes.  My current implementation has all of that visibility closed,
when you create a new network namespace.  But there are still
interactions.  For me it isn't a real problem though as I have
a single system administrator and synchronized user ids.  For
other use case it is a different story.
In a more normal use case, the container admin can't get out, but
the box admin can get in.  At least for simple things like monitoring
and possibly some debugging.
Or you get weird cases where you want to allow access to some of
the files in /proc to the container but not all.
If I am the machine admin and I have discovered a process in
a container it has a bug and is going wild, it is preferable
to kill that process, or possibly that container rather than
rebooting the box to solve the problem.
All of the normal every day interactions get handled fine and there
is simply no visibility.  But I don't ever expect perfect isolation,
from the machine admin.
I do still need to read up on the selinux mandatory access controls.
Although the comment from the NSA selinux FAQ about selinux being
just a proof-of-concept and no security bugs were discovered or
looked for during it's implementation scares me.
