Hello,
I'm newbie in kernel programming and try to write filesystem, and have two problems.
1) There are not "<mount-point>/.", "<mount-point>/..", and "<mount-point>/<any_dir>/.." entries,
for example:
# ls -a
dir  link  text_file
# ls -a dir/
.  level_2
# ls -a dir/level_2/
.  ..
I make
      filldir(dirent, ".", 1, i, ino, DT_DIR) and
      filldir(dirent, "..", 2, i, parent_ino(filp->f_dentry))
in readdir() for all directories.
2) Problem with removing not empty directories:
# ls -l
total 135
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root      0 Nov  6 17:48 dir
lr-xr-xr-x  1 root root   1024 Nov  2 11:13 link -> /home/undefer
-r-xr-xr-x  1 root root 274944 Nov  2 11:13 text_file
# rmdir dir
rmdir: `dir': Directory not empty
# ls -l
total 135
?---------  0 root root      0 Jan  1  1970 dir
lr-xr-xr-x  1 root root   1024 Nov  2 11:13 link -> /home/undefer
-r-xr-xr-x  1 root root 274944 Nov  2 11:13 text_file
So anything call "delete_inode" for directory and it's entries but it is not empty! What is? Why? What I could made not so?
Thanks,
Sorry for bad english.
