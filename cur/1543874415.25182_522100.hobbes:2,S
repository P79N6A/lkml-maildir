None of that conflicts with what I said, but what works on an LCD may 
not be appropriate for a CRT. With even moderate 1024x768@70 timing the 
horizontal retrace happens ~50k/sec, and that's not an appropriate 
syscall rate. I'm just pointing out that some things a video interface 
does with simple hardware involve lots of very small windows. Don't read 
that as "don't do it," just "be careful HOW you do it."

I'm going to cautiously guess that the problem might be not "how much" 
but "how soon." That is, latency might be more important than giving the 
server a lot of CPU.
