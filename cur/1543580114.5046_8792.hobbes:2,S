Subject: swapoff problem in 2.4.0ac9

I was doing some tests over the weekend, and after doing a swapoff -a
and stressing the system, I hit the bad_device: goto in __swap_free():
	printk("swap_free: Trying to free swap from unused 
swap-device\n");
I was compiling kernels at the time. The swap setup was a 200Mb partition
on /dev/hda and a 40Mb partition on /dev/hdb
This was 2.4.0ac9
thanks
