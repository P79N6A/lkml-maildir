It needs to be the drivers job, to be documented as such and to be
implemented properly in some drivers. In paticular there are some extremely
interesting closedown races in existing drivers where it goes
		CPU1			CPU2
	release

					open
					ioctl

	slow thing done
	trash the chip setup
	turn the chip off
	return
