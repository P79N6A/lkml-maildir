Yes, it is, but I'd rather remove the disable_nonboot_cpus() from
power_down() (as Eric suggested) instead of trying to handle the RCU sync
problem here.
This has been caused by my commit 94985134b7b46848267ed6b734320db01c974e72
(swsusp: disable nonboot CPUs before entering platform suspend) that in such a
case should be reverted.
