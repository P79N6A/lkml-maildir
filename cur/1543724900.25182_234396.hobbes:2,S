No, I meant kref_get(). See below.

Yes, and how do the callers guarantee that ? Using a lock, right ?
What Kiran's patch does is to allow those callers to use lock-free
algorithms. Let's look at the race -

                                 my_put() from a user who did my_lookup() ...

Somebody dereferences m and
invalid memory reference

This can happen if my_lookup() is lock-free.

How are you going to shrink it ? You need the ->release() method
and that is a nice way for drivers to get rid of objects.

And I suspect that Andrew thwak me for trying to increase dentry size :)
Anyway, the summary is this - Kiran is not trying to introduce
a new refcounting API. He is just adding lock-free support from
an existing refcounting mechanism that is used in VFS. If kref users need to do
lock-free lookup, sure we should add it to kref_xxx APIs also.

Actually, we already use lock-free refcounting in route cache, dcache. In those
cases, we work around this race using a different algorithm.
