Subject: [PATCH] pciehp dont enable slot unless forced

This fixes a 2.6.25 regression reported by Alex Chiang.
Invoke pciehp_enable_slot() at startup only when pciehp_force=1.
Some HP equipment apparently cannot cope with it otherwise.
This restores the (previously working) 2.6.24 behaviour here,
while allowing machines that need a kick to use pciehp_force=1.
This was the original design back in October 2007,
but Kristen suggested we try without it first:

This ended up breaking one of Alex's setups,
so it's time to put the wrapper back in now.
