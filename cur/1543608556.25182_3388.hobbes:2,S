Attribution error: that was me, disagreeing with Jakob - the point was
if you want to dink with the format to achieve the objectives
he seemed to be after (which I thought were to do at least
in part with consistency etc.), it is theoretically possible
to do such dinking with minimal change & certainly retain
text format (and note I said retain original /proc files too). Whether
it's worth it as a practical exercize, with all the inherent
disruption it would no doubt cause, and questionable net benefit
is a completely different question. I was just saying that
binary format wasn't necessary to achieve what I think
Jakob wanted to achieve. The full thought
experiment was in a later email. I suspect you don't disagree
given your previous post.

Sorry, I meant 'this way a consistent interface cf
sysctl could be used for more of what's currently
done through /proc'. Last time I looked there was
stuff you could read/write to through /proc which
couldn't be done through sysctl.
