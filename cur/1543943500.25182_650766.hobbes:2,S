Of course we can always destroy the memory region but that would break
the semantics that applications expect.  Basically an application can
register some chunk of its memory and get a key that it can pass to a
remote peer to let the remote peer operate on its memory via RDMA.
And that memory region/key is expected to stay valid until there is an
application-level operation to destroy it (or until the app crashes or
gets killed, etc).

That would of course work -- dumb adapters would just always fail,
which might be inefficient.
