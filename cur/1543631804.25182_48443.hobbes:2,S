We'll discuss that on the RTAI mailing list.

You are right, and be sure we'll do our best to clarify the situation as
good as possible. Take into account that the license change took place just
recently and there are surely things left which have to be cleaned up. It
is common agreement between the RTAI team that patches and schedulers are
GPL, self-developed services are LGPL. 
Sidenote: before the 24.1.9 release we publically asked on the RTAI mailing
list if we have missed somebody in the "authors" file:

Nobody has spoken up who is not listed there so far.
