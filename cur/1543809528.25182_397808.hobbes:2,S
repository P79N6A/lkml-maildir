Yep, and I didn't even notice the extra space.

We could share the code that computes time_adjust_step, i.e. this
much:
	if ((time_adjust_step = time_adjust) != 0) {
		/*
		 * We are doing an adjtime thing.  Prepare time_adjust_step to
		 * be within bounds.  Note that a positive time_adjust means we
		 * want the clock to run faster.
		 *
		 * Limit the amount of the step to be in the range
		 * -tickadj .. +tickadj
		 */
		time_adjust_step = min(time_adjust_step, (long)tickadj);
		time_adjust_step = max(time_adjust_step, (long)-tickadj);
	}
Is that enough to be worth factoring out?  Note that
update_wall_time_one_tick() needs both time_adjust_step and
delta_nsec, so to share more, we would have to have a function
returning two values and it would start to get ugly.
Paul.
