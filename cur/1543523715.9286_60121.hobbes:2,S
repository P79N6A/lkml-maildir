Some data.  Specifically the SSE vector floating point values, which are
16 bytes long.

No, that's not correct.  It might achieve the greatest execution speed
if you access only one of the characters, and very, very rarely under
special circumstances.  Being so rare it wouldn't be worth doing.

That's the recommendation yes.  Except the different recommendations
apply to code alignment.
The reason GCC 2.95 aligns stacks to 16 bytes by default is because of
the 128 bit SSE vector floating point values.  Which hardly anyone uses :-)
