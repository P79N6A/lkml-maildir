Recursive spinlocks only hide the problem - consider programmers who take
lock B and recklessly call a subroutine that takes lock A followed be lock
B.  The resulting code will appear to work fine, but may have introduced a
subtle AB-BA deadlock.  I'd rather have a coding defect that reliably and
consistently causes a deadlock than one that causes deadlocks in rare
timing related cases.

If the kernel invokes a callback with an obscure lock held (that is
promiscuous enough to be grabbed in other helper sub-routines), then its
probably a bug - why not just fix it?
