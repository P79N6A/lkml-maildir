Hi
Thanks for your answer. The compiler version (and the compiler itself)
is
"gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314" but I will check this Monday at the
office again.
I do not load any modules (as far as I remember), because there is no
"need" for... so far I can see.
System.map matches kernel version (I checked this after upgrading from
2.2.3 to 2.2.5 to 2.2.10).
But to be sure, I will post /proc/modules and the other information on
Monday.
Thank you, Dietmar
