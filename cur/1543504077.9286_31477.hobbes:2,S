It is. But nevertheless, SCHED_IDLE is a good instrument
for well-behaving apps. I have ran a much more primitive
version of the patch for over half a year and have seen
only one (3-minute) hang.
Other workloads might give different results, but that's
why the sysctl switch is there...
Another possibility is adding priority inheritance code
to the _slow path_ of the locking code (ie. only try the
unlocking code if you can't get the lock within a second).
