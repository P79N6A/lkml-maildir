Maybe the code over in page-writeback.c should just rearm the timee within
the timer handler rather than waiting for a pdflush thread to do it.  I'll
think about that.
But the main questions is: what on earth is going on here?  We've taken a
kernel thread and we've done a wake_up_process() on it, but because it was
in a frozen state it just never gets to run, even after the resume. 
Presumably it goes back into interruptible sleep after the resume.  We took
it off the list (in the expectation that it'd run again) so we've lost
control of it.
Pavel, Rafael: this amounts to a lost wakeup.  What's the story?
