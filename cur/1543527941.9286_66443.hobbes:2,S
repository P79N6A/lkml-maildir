In general, the two hwif's of a given pci-device must know about each
other.  This is because some hardware designs serialize, share, or some
other thing with the ISR.
Some of the IDE-PCI detection code verifies if the interface is enabled
or disabled in the BIOS.  Thus you can have the case where the primary is
disabled in the BIOS but the secondary is set and used for the ATAPI
hardware.

As above:
primary-hwif is disabled but secondary-hwif is enabled
(primary)hwif		== NULL
(primary)hwif->mate	!= NULL
(secondary)hwif		!= NULL
(secondary)hwif->mate	== NULL
The loop looks like:
(primary)hwif		== (secondary)hwif->mate
(secondary)hwif		== (primary)hwif->mate
(primary)hwif->mate	== (secondary)hwif
(secondary)hwif->mate	== (primary)hwif
Is this clear?
