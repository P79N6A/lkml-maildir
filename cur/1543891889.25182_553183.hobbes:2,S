4 is not between 1 and 4.

You should select CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G.

Personally, I feel the wording should say:
Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and 4 or more gigabytes of
physical RAM.
It may not hurt to say 3 or more, but I'm not that familiar with x86
hardware in regards to memory.

It does.
Here's my system (4gb of memory):
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       3619996    3289352     330644          0     469764    2025416
-/+ buffers/cache:     794172    2825824
Swap:            0          0          0
I know it says 3.6gb of memory, but 4gb is installed.  I had 5gb in this
machine and I saw all 5gb.  This is a 32-bit dual xeon (12gb max memory)
I would be interested to know where the last 400mb of memory went.
