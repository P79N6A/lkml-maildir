I tried the other way -- I am trying to keep the percpu counter in use
in ext2/3 as much as possible.  I proposed a fix for percpu counter to
deal with the possible "overflow" (i.e, a counter really has a value of
0xfff_feee and after updating one local counter it truens 0x00000123).
Will send the proposed patch out for review and comments soon.
