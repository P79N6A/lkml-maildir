This is generally true, though there are a few situations where x86 GCC
makes some decisions about which instruction pattern to use before it
realises that `this_cpu' is constant.  It probably makes no difference
in this example.
Of course, it knows the array has only one element so in principle it
could always just optimise away the index ;-)
