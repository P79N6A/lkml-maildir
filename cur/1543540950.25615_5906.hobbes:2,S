  Probably not worth it for fs_cachep.  But should be need investigated.
  My old slab allocator would fit a control struct behind the actual
object (in between the padding to an L1 bound).  With Manfred's changes, I
believe this to still be the case.
  The new allocator I'm working on will also fit the control struct
between objects (and at the end of a slab, and off-slab).  Plus, it will
allow different caches (with similar attributes) to share slabs - this is
only useful on low memory machines for caches which tend to have very few
allocations from them (say, the uid-cache, which takes up a full page for
only a few allocations on some system usage patterns - it would be
better off using one of the general sized caches - which is why I
originally implemented kmem_find_general_cachep()).
