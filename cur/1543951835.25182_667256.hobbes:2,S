that is not something that makes a difference of a few milliseconds

you just use a redundant system and you no longer care how long it takes 
to shutdown or startup a system. if you're running a datacenter that cares 
about uptime to the point of counting 9's or buying a Violin box you are 
already going to need redundant machines so that you can perform upgrades.

it also takes the faith that you will never have any unplanned shutdowns, 
since your system will loose massive amounts of data if they happen. 
nobody who worries about 9's will buy into that argument. you achieve 9's 
by figuring that things don't always work, and as a result you figure out 
how to engineer around the failures so that when they happen you stay up. 
manufacturers have been trying to promise that their boxes are so reliable 
that they won't go down for decades, and they haven't suceeded yet.
