Not sure if I can bring this up to multi user yet. Some initial testing
in single user mode indicates problems when I turn on networking. See
the attached messages from /var/log/messages to see the kinds of problems
I am having. The key ones appear after doing
  ./S10network start
as part of single stepping the init sequence. I stopped at this point
to make sure I had a good record of the messages.
I also managed to get the machine stuck with
  /sbin/reboot
not sure why.
And yes, the .config is basically the same as in all previous tests.
(no changes since my first tests with -T4...)
A side question - if
  CONFIG_PREEMPT_REALTIME=y
you say that IRQ's must be threaded, is this going to be "permanent" and
if so - why?
I would prefer to not use threaded IRQ's if possible due to lower CPU
overhead [see previous email describing results...] and some problems
I see with setting priorities on those IRQ's (relative to real time tasks).
