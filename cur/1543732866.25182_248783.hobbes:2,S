ISO9660 is designed for read-only, i.e., modifying something in the middle
is probably as hard to do as just unpack/modify/repack. Same for tar, cpio,
and compressed versions of same. No gain, for a major hassle implementing
this.

You save iff the resources spent updating this stuff is less than
recomputing on the fly each time. Also, placing random stuff in the kernel
is _not_ "zero cost", it is _very_ expensive (kernel memory is always
resident, kernel code is _extremely_ critical, once it is in the kernel it
is very hard to change interfaces). Besides, this kind of "metadata" will
most probably be different for each user, and a user should also be able to
associate it to files she has no write right on. I.e., keep it in a
per-user directory, managed by whatever GUI tools she uses.
What you (developer) wish for and what kernel hackers are able to deliver
aren't the same. As it stands this is a badly-thought-through proposal,
with very complex ramifications that few here are aware of (see Al Viro's
and Linus' posts about locking; it breaks the fundamental principle that
something is a file or a directory, so this would break many applications),
and no clean solutions as of now.
