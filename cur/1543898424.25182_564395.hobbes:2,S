Never be usable? I made you a concrete example that is like 8 months old. 
And *that* could not have been cleanly handled with the flat structure 
idea.
The extra flags parameter is one example where we'd need an extra flags 
field in the task_struct in any case. So you need in any case code that 
does extra checks and merges normal parameters/flags with the shared 
context ones. This independently of the method used. But there are 
examples (and the signal stuff is one of them), where you do need the 
set_context+syscall+unset_context abstraction, for all cases where the 
kernel already has its own internal data strctures. In those cases you'd 
have to spread sys_internal context knowledge all around the kernel, 
whereas the current solution allows you to confine the code inside 
kernel/indirect.c (through the set/unset abstraction). And this w/out even 
try to hit the weak spot of about how this structure will look after a few 
additions.
