Just by chance... I was looking for options...
BTW, i could look for it but perhaps you know the answer. I use a zip
to move files between osx at the uni and my home linux. I have always been
hit bit the short name length in hfs. Does hfs+ increase it ? If not, have
you been able to read UFS filesystems created on osx with Linux UFS ?
And finally, while we are at it, I also did some other changes, some aesthetic
and some needed to patch on top of 2.4.21-rc1:
- Changed a bit the description strings in Config.in and Configure.help to
  uniformize HFS and HFS+.
- Moved HFS+ next to HFS in Configure.in
- Killed your new_inode() macro, that function is already in -rc1 (yup, if
  you want to maintain backwards compat, it would be better to wrap it
  with a LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,4,???), since when is
  new_inode() in ?)
Modified version, including the hfsplus dir and the 64 bit changes, is at
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/hfsplus-20030507-2.bz2
Can you check it ?
TIA
