Why do you need to know about geometry?  Geometry is a useless fiction 
that only still exists in PC system BIOS for the sake of backward 
compatibility with software that was originally designed to operate with 
MFM and RLL disks that actually used geometric addressing.  These days 
there is no such thing; it's just made up by the bios.

This is not suitable because block devices may not be bios accessible, 
and thus, nowhere to get any bogus geometry information from.  Even if 
it is, do we really want to be calling the bios to get this information 
and keep it around?

What for?  The only purpose to geometry is bios compatibility.  Changing 
the kernel's copy of the values won't do any good because the bios won't 
be changed.
