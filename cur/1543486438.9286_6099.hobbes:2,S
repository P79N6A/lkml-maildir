My problem is to inside qualify in safe way the use of icq of a
masquerade network using kernel 2.0.36 and ipfwadm as firewall. 
However in the site www.freashmeat.net I found a possible solution
using kernel 2.2.x using a module written for this kernel, but the filter
is not more ipfwadm and yes ipchain. 
Somebody already passed for this and has some suggestion,
therefore really I am needing any information that can help me
either in any scene. 
Thanks
Alexandre
