In which case, you can't boot. Think about it.
Never mind the method. One way or another, it is very often
possible for a normal users to set up a chroot environment
with the device files that are needed. Maybe they do something
obscene with the admin. :-) So chroot() is useful for users.
In my case, I _am_ the admin and I just don't want to run
every damn little test program and hack as root.
