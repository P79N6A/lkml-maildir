I've run 2.4.20 for a long time, and have been seriously plagued with
the I/O stalls.
On a file server (details below) here I upgraded to 2.4.21-rc6
yesterday.
The I/O stalls have *almost* gone away.
Best of all, we still have our data intact  ;)
Server data:
  ~130 GB data on a ~150 GB ext3fs with >1 million files
  Software RAID-0+1 on four IDE disks
  Two promise controllers 1x20262 1x20269
  1x Intel eepro100, 1x Intel e1000
  dual PIII, half a gig of memory
  NFS server (mainly v3, many different clients)

This server rarely has load below 1, but frequently above 15.  It may
run some compilers and linkers locally, but most of the load comes from
NFS serving.
So far it's been running for 28 hours with that kind of load.  Nothing
suspicious in the dmesg yet.
I will of course let you all know if it falls on it's knees.
So far it's all thumbs-up from me!   There may still be an occational
stall here and there, but compared to 2.4.20 this is heaven (it really
was unbelievably annoying having your emacs stall for 10 seconds every
30 seonds when someone was linking on the cluster)  :)
A big *thank*you* to Marcelo for deciding to include a fix for the I/O
stalls!
