Subject: adding bits_per_word to struct spi_board_info to mirror struct spi_device

the spi_device structure has a bits_per_word so that you can change
the value on a per-device setting, yet the spi_board_info structure
does not ... this means that the bus-specific structure has to have a
bits_per_word member which the spi bus driver will copy into the spi
device bits_per_word member
is there something obvious i'm missing ?  seems to me that if the
generic spi framework respects bits_per_word on a per-spi device
basis, then it should be exposed in the generic info structure so that
the setting can be tracked in the boards file ...
