There are two approaches to fixing this.
  1.  Rate limit fork().  Unfortunately some legitimate usges do a lot
      of forking, and you don't really want to slow them down.
  2.  Limit (per user) the number of processes allowed. This is what's
      currently done; and if you as administrator want to you can set
      RLIMIT_NPROC in /etc/security/limits.conf
On an almost-single-user system such as most desktops, there isn't much
point in setting this.  On shared systems, it can be useful.
