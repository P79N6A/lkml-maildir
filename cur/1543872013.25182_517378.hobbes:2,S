This patch needs a lot more documentation.  It needs some really big
comments on why this should never ever be used for a real filesystem
(real as in user mountable), and probably add an assert for that
invariant somewhere.  Please also update Documentation/filesystems/Locking
and Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt for it.
