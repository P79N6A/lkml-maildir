Subject: 2.6: kconfig handling of recursive dependencies could be improved

Hi Roman,
I tried to implement a "select at least one of these options" using the 
following Kconfig snippet:
config A
        bool "a"
config B
        bool "b"
config C
        bool
        default y if A=n && B=n
        select A
        select B
"make *config" says
  Warning! Found recursive dependency: A C A
  Warning! Found recursive dependency: C A C B
and handles it a bit strange.
Yes, there is a limited recursion, but it's a finite recursion and I 
don't know of any other way to express this in the current kconfig 
language.
