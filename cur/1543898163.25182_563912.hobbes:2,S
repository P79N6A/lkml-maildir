Could you clarify why this is? It looks like kthreads and signalling
should be more or less orthogonal. Or is it just an issue of the
complexity added when you mix signalling into kthreads?
Note that the problem of insulation from userspace signals predates the
conversion to using the kthreads interface for cifsd. So even if we
revert the switch of the demultiplexer thread to kthreads in the near
term, I'd like to keep the recent change to block all signals from
userspace and use force_sig in lieu of send_sig.
Does that sound reasonable?
