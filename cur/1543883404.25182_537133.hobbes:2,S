above is block size, not sector size

then you are limited to blocks (and therefore sectors) <= page size, so 
<= 4096.
You can -mkfs- something bigger, but you won't be able to mount it.

This is mkfs.xfs trying to be smart about making larger "sectors" (== 
blocksize) on an md device, so that it does not switch the size of the 
IO requests between data & metadata, slowing things down significantly. 
  however,
        -s     Sector size options.
               This  option  specifies the fundamental sector size of 
the filesystem.  The
               valid suboptions are: log=value and size=value; only one 
can  be  supplied.
               The  sector  size  is  specified  either as a base two 
logarithm value with
               log=, or in bytes with size=.  The default value is 512 
bytes.  The minimum
               value  for  sector  size is 512; the maximum is 32768 (32 
KiB).  The sector
               size must be a power of 2 size and cannot be made larger 
than the  filesys-
               tem block size.
looks like a buglet where it is trying to make a block == sector == 64k, 
but sectors are limited to 32.
But this is not what you want anyway, assuming you want to actually 
*mount* your new  filesystem on x86_64.  Just make take default 
blocksize (4k) and be happy.

it's not, but that's not why this broke.
