I remember (thinking back) I had to up the number of processes and file
descriptors.  Perhaps this had to do with CGI's and the fact that the
entire site is PHP/database backended.  I was getting "Resource
temporarily unavailable.  This was after I had raised MaxClients and the
hard limits in src/include/httpd.h.  I had to change the ulimits for
descriptors and processes.
If 1024 people simultanously connected, and requested a page, would that
not be 1024 open files? or no?  What about the sockets themselves, do
those count as fd's too?
