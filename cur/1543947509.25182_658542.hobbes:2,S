Seems a poor idea to me.  Sure, oprofile is "hard to set up", but not if
your distributor already did it for you.
Sidebar: the code uses the utterly crappy register_timer_hook() which 
a) is woefully misnamed and
b) is racy and 
c) will disrupt oprofile if it is being used.  And vice versa.
This code adds a new kernel->userspace interface which is not even
documented in code comments.  It appears to use a pollable debugfs file in
/proc somewhere, carrying an unspecified payload.
What happens when multiple processes are consuming data from the same
debugfs file?

checkpatch used to warn that linux/uaccess.h is preferred over asm/uaccess.h
but this is another of those checkpatch features which seems to have
mysteriously disappeared, or it broke?

Access to head and tail appear to be racy.  See below.

We read `head' before taking the "lock".  Another CPU could modify it after
we took a local copy.

It'd be nice to make INTERVAL a power of 2.

Why not use spin_trylock()?  Then you get lockdep support too.
And why not use spin_lock()?  At least a comment should be added explaining
and justifying this peculiar home-made-not-really-locking design.

And the changelog should explain and justify why we cannot profile root's
code.  I cannot begin to imagine why it was done and I cannot fathom why it
passed uncommented in documentation, code, changelog and "review" comments. 
It greatly reduces the usefulness of an already dubious feature.
If this limitation _was_ documented then I'd be in a position to ask what is
special about root, as opposed to some non-root user who has <unspecified>
capabilities.  And why we penalise a root who has dropped <unspecified>
capabilities.  etcetera.
Is this open-coded test of ->pid correct in a containerised environment?

This is ambiguous in a containerised environment.
Ingo, please be alert for anything which exposes raw pids to userspace.
I don't know what a correct and suitable interface might be - perhaps Pavel
or Eric can suggest something.

The (absent) interface documentation should explain what happens when a
fault causes this information to be truncated.

`head' can just merrily advance over `tail' and there is no notification to
userspace of the lost data.

Please put a blank line between end-of-variables and start-of-code.
This seems to be a wrong return value?  Shouldn't it just return zero if
there was nothing there?  As can happen if some other process is reading the
same debugfs file?
> +	BUG_ON(tail->pid == 0);
whee.  There was no locking above to prevent the tasks's pid from
transitioning from non-zero to zero after it was tested.  Which means this
is triggerable.  Perhaps the implicit locking due to cpu-pinnedness and
interruption will prevent that race.  If so, such a subtlety should be
commented, no?

There is no locking for `tail', and afaict we support multiple simultaneous
readers.

This reads a single item even if there were 100 queued, which is quite 
inefficient.
We already have infrastructure for bulk kernel->user transfer in
kernel/relay.c?

This function will enable sysprof-trace even if prof_on==0,
prof_on==SLEEP_PROFILING, etc which is pointless.

This is broken for 32-bit userspace running on a 64-bit kernel.  Unless
said userspace jumps through hoops and works out that it's running under a
64-bit kernel.
There might be alignment issues for addresses[], being at offset 12.

This is pretty distressing, frankly.  The threshold for getting code into
Linux should be much higher than this.
I do not have the time to review everything which goes into all the git
trees.  Better review, please.
