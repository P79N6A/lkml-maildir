Subject: [PATCH] HPT374 kernel panic - regression in 2.6.8

Hello,
HighPoint 374 driver in 2.6.8 can cause kernel panic on boot with 
non-33MHz timings because some lines from an older version have been 
included in the source again. After removing the check, HPT374 works 
just fine using internal PLL.
