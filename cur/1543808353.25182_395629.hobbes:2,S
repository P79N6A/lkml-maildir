This is a Linux implementation detail. As such it would make sense to
introduce a new Linux specific MS_ flag for this.

Definitely. And when the app gives us a hint that it really wants the
data on the disk, starting it as early as possible is also a good
optimisation.

I don't think there's anything wrong with your fadvise additions.
I'd rather see MS_ASYNC start IO immediately and add another MS_
flag for Linux to propogate bits.
MS_ASYNC behaviour would also somewhat match your proposed FADV_ASYNC
behaviour.

I think if the interface was always documented correctly then we should
be able to. If the app breaks it was buggy anyway.

Yes they'd be nice.
Instead of
LINUX_FADV_ASYNC_WRITE
LINUX_FADV_WRITE_WAIT
can we have something more consistent? Perhaps
FADV_WRITE_ASYNC
FADV_WRITE_SYNC
