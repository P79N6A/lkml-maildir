It's not really well documented (I found it by accident), but you can
see the individual item help; you just need to type the choice number
followed by a question mark, like so:
Choose SLAB allocator
  1. SLAB (SLAB)
> 2. SLUB (Unqueued Allocator) (SLUB)
choice[1-2?]: 1?
The regular slab allocator that is established and known to work
well in all environments. It organizes cache hot objects in
per cpu and per node queues. SLAB is the default choice for
a slab allocator.
