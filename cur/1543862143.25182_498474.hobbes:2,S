Subject: [PATCH 0/3] workqueue: cpu-hotplug fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series is not tested, 2.6.20-rc3-mm1 panics on boot for me, please review.
It tries to fix all known cpu-hotplug related problems in workqueue.c.
These problems are old, they were not introduced by recent changes. I strongly
beleive we can't fix them if we change cpu-hotplug to use freezer.
Oleg.
