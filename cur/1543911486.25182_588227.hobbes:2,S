My observation is actually from the other side, Alan. I run a list
that used to send exactly such messages and got complaints from people
in this community about running a subscribers-only list. My natural
conclusion was that the messages were considered to be a problem.
Given that the moderation messages from Mailman actually mention
"subscribers-only", I can't blame non-subscribers for feeling
thwarted, frustrated, annoyed, or inconvenienced when they receive it.
Since I was already whitelisting legitimate posters, I simply turned
off the moderation messages back to the poster. Now the fact that the
list is moderated is completely transparent and no one gets any rude
automated messages.
