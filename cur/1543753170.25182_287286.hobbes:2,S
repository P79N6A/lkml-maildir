No, I emailed saying that kdb on x86_64 does NOT show the values of 
parameters passed to functions in the backtrace. And, ok, it has some 
other bugs (e.g. reboot doesn't work on SMP) too. But generally speaking 
kdb does work on x86_64. It just still has bugs, but so does every piece 
of software. We should just fix them all, that's all :)
Kind regards
