I guess my mistake here was to present it as a patch submission.  I 
acknowledged in my cover letter that it wasn't feature complete and I'm not 
pushing for inclusion just yet.  I'm very much aware of the point that when 
replacing a subsystem like this, the new code has to be as good as the old 
code.  In that respect, the patches I posted are lacking in other areas 
(isochronous streaming is the big one) that will take more work to fix than 
just making it work on big-endian and 64-bit architectures.  It's still a work 
in progress.
Having said that, I've been working on this for a while now, and I wanted to 
announce the effort and open the discussion about replacing the old stack. 
Something about "release early, release often"... :)  Anyway, I've moved the 
portability issues to the top of my list now.
