arrgh!  i just realised my script buggered up and was producing the same
graph for all the results.  please have a look at the page again, sorry.
apart from that, i'm still confused.  compared to other graphs produced
by the latencytest program, my system seems to have huge latencies.
unless i'm reading it wrongly, the graph is saying that i'm getting
latencies of up to 30ms, and a lot of overruns.  compare this to
    
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/2.4.0-test2/3x256.html
which shows latencytest on 2.4.0-test2, and
    
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/2.2.10-p133-3x128/3x128.html
which are the results for latencytest on 2.2.10.  admittedly these
kernels are much older, but i'm consistently getting far more latency
than those kernels.  that's the bit i'm confused about :)  i've tried
Andrew Morton's low-latency patches as well, to no avail.  i've made
sure i've tuned my hard disks correctly, and i don't have any other
realtime processes running.
am i concerned with a different issue than the one you're addressing?

yep, i agree with that ... so why is latencytest showing scheduling
latencies of > 30ms?  i get the feeling i'm confusing two different
issues here.  from what i understand, /proc/latencytimes shows the
how long it takes for various functions in the kernel to finish, and
the latencytest result shows how long it takes for it to be
re-scheduled (represented by the white line on the graph).
