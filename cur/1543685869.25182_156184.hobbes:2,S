Hello,
with the 2.6.0-test3 kernel, hpt366 still does nothing else than kernel 
panic on my machine. However, I found that with my EPoX 8K9A3+, the 0x78 
(frequency) register of HPT374 has values in the interval of 0x9B..0x9E, 
although the FSB is set to 133MHz and PCI should be at 33. Then, in 
init_hpt37x, the execution usually goes thru the "freq < 0xb0" branch, 
which doesn't do the pci_set_drvdata stuff. Later, the frequency 
detection loop fails because hpt374 internal PLL isn't supported. 
However, changing the respective branch to
         } else if (freq < 0xb0) {
                 pll = F_LOW_PCI_40;
                 if (hpt_minimum_revision(dev,8)) {
                         pci_set_drvdata(dev, (void *) 		 
thirty_three_base_hpt374);
                         printk("HPT37X: using 33MHz PCI clock\n");
                 }
	} ...
made the driver work, although I didn't have time to test it (just 
mounted the disk and copied a few files).
Regards,
