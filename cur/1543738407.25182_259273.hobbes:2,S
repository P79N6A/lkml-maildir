It is true that you have to make some modifications to your Xbox, for
example: flashing the BIOS with Cromwell (BIOS with a Linux loader).
The main reason why it should be merged (in my opinion) is that a lot of
Linux distro's reject Xbox-Linux because it's not in the mainline
sourcetree (Debian for example, they only want vanilla platforms).
These patches are only 102 lines together, which is a small amount to
support a new platform.
Yours,
