If you'd be the os i guess you'd not say the same :)
It was pretty clear the model i meant was one real thread/process per fd.
The main difference with coroutines is that the /dev/epoll engine become
the scheduler of your app.
It's also clear that you can avoid the coroutines by writing a state machine.
There's a HUGE memory save with the stack removal that you pay with a more
complicated code.
