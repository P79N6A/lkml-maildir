No!! 
That's not cute and wonderful, that's _horrible_.
Mixing data and code on the same page is very very slow on a P4 (well, I
think it's "same half-page", but the point is that you should not EVER
mix data and code - it ends up being slow on modern CPU's).

Since almost all x86 CPU's have some kind of cacheline exclusion policy
between the I$ and the D$ (to handle the strict x86 I$ coherency
requirements), your "if you're lucky" is completely bogus.  In fact,
you'd be the _pessimal_ cache behaviour for something like that, ie you
get lines that ping-pong between the L2 and the two instruction caches. 
Don't do it. Keep data and code on separate pages.
