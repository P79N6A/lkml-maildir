Exactly the reason why in one of my first versions I wanted to do away
with that feature.... until you pointed out that it was actually using
more *memory* when not compressed, because of the way the buffer cache
works when the initramfs is put into place (it is not freed "as we go",
but only at the very end, so at one point in time there will be 2 copies
which will of course be larger when they're both uncompressed).
I'm getting the impression that again, anybody wanting to propose an
enhancement must solve _all_ pre-existing problems in that area... While
this certainly leads to better code once a patch does make it, it will
certainly discourage many.
Maybe we can separate both issues, and tackle the initramfs case
entirely separately (maybe by proving a buffer cache enhancement that
allows to free initramfs' memory "as we go").
