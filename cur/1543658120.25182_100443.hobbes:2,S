Just to point out - I said "If closed source modules were to be disallowed,".
Also - the question isn't whether closed source modules can be distributed,
as much as "can closed source modules that could not be compiled without GPL
source code (header files), be distributed?"
RMS wishes my configuration (Linux + ClearCase MVFS) to be illegal,
because he wishes to enforce an all-free ("free" as defined by RMS)
final product, and the existence of closed-source hardware drivers
(nVidia) or software extensions (ClearCase MVFS) are in the way of
this goal.
If he succeeds, I may lose the freedom to effectively use Linux,
because I don't *mind* buying good software, and I don't *mind* if it
is closed source. Why don't I mind? Because, with few exceptions,
closed source software for expensive price tags tends to be better, or
fuller in some way, in my experience. We live in a capitalist society.
Pretending that capitalism can be avoided is... not realistic.
