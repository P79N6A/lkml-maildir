I don't know how you'd do it. I know you wouldn't count people telling you
how good they are (getting people to tell you how bad they are, and whether
others do better in a given situation might be slightly move viable).
But we have to choose somehow. I'd hope that is going to be based solely
on the results and technical properties of the code, so... if we were to
somehow determine that the results are exactly the same, we'd go for the
the simpler one, wouldn't we?

Well I know people have had woes with the scheduler for ever (I guess that
isn't going to change :P). I think people generally lost a bit of interest
in trying to improve the situation because of the upstream problem.
