Per the PCI firmware spec (I'm looking at draft 0.9, version 3.0),
the OS must explicitly get control of native pcie hotplug from
firmware using _OSC before trying to use it. Firmware may be
deliberately not creating an _OSC because it is controlling the
hotplug hardware, or may be aware of other reasons (e.g. errata)
why OS native pcie hotplug should not be used on this platform.
So no, I don't think we can load and use pciehp if there's
no _OSC implemented in firmware.
