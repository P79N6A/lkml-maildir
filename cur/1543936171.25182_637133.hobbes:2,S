Probably true that it's not worth the space.  I couldn't figure a way to do
it that doesn't use at least 8 bytes per vector.  Of course, the vectors
>= 32 are never interesting, so 256 bytes of dispatch table could cover it.
Anyway, I think it's fine just to have the patch on hand to enable for a
particular debugging session, which is what I wrote it for.  Maybe it could
be a config option.
Thanks,
Roland
