Ah, that's why people get hit by it if they have less than 4GB. ;-)

Well, I think the majority of NX-capable CPUs are also x86_64, in which case
I'd recommend using a 64-bit kernel anyway.
Thanks for the clarification.
I was afraid the issue would be urgent, but it doesn't seem so now.  I'd like to
postpone fixing it until we can create suspend images larger that 350 meg on
i386 boxes with highmem (the patch is ready to go to -mm after 2.6.19-rc1 as
2.6.20 material).
Greetings,
Rafael
