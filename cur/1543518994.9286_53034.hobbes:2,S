Subject: 2.3.31: oops probably caused by hardware. But what?

Hello gurus.
I'm running an oldish cyrix166 packed solid with disks and boards. It
used to work OK (for months, non-stop). I have recently moved the
computer to a new abode, and it started to crash with alarmingly high
frequence. The crash is not the typical oops-like one: it dumps
truckloads of screens full with numbers, and what (generally) remains
when the crash has completed is something like
[<c0111958>] [<c022ca01>] [<c010c1f1>] [<c0113bb2>] [<c022d0f0>] [<c011ace1>] [<c011b015>] [<c010c54a>] 
(repeated N times, then)
Code: c7 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 83 c4 04 89 f9 ff 09 0f 88 34
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Bad magic b (should be c0ffa394), wq bug, forcing oops
I am pretty sure I have hardware problems because I am getting various
crashes also with an old kernel (I call it "evergreen"), that has been
successfully running for weeks in the past. The above crash is
experienced with 2.3.31 compiled with gcc 2.8.1, but I had similar
problems when compiling with 2.95.1. Crashes can happen at various
times, from immediately after boot to after a few hours.
From your collective experience, where should I point my attention?
Memory? (I inverted the two dimms I have - a 32mb one and a 64mb one -
and made sure they were correctly seated)
Other cards? (the last oops I had, right after boot, colored the
screen (apart from the penguin section - I run fb on a Matrox
Millennium II pci) dark green, so I now inverted the position of the
video card with that of one of the two ethernet cards and it has
*still* not crashed again).. Or the motherboard? It could be time for
me to move to something newer after all...
Thanks for any light you can shed!
Carlo
