Yeah - probably so.
    When someone gets serious about things like checkpoint, restart, and
    migrate functionality, based on this container cloning, working with
    cpusets, they will probably have to revisit this interaction with
    exclusive cpusets.
Perhaps a comment could be put in the code, saying something like the
above, so whomever does this will realize they are traveling in
unchartered territory.
