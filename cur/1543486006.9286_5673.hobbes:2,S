I've seen the same problem with old libraries (libc 5, ncurses) while
exiting from 'screen' sessions using Ctrl-K instead of 'exit'. The same
happens infrequently on a new RH5.2 system. Though I cannot reproduce it
regularly as I used to be able to. It started to show up in the later
2.1.x kernels and I reported it back then but nobody noticed. :-)
