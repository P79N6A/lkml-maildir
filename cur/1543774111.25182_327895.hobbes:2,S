I'd agree that embedded setups are the ones that have been slowest to
switch over, for various reasons.  One of them is that many LKML folk
ignore embedded systems issues; "just PC class or better".  Another
has been that the basic hotplug scripts never worked well with "ash",
and who's going to want to ship "bash" and friends?  :)
Those problems seem resolved with 2.6.12 and current modutils and udev.
Leaving basically an "upgrade your userspace" requirement.

Hmm, could you explain why you think udev-on-ramfs/tmpfs/... is still
unready?  And what it's "unready" for?  It can work fine without
needing to hack early userspace and initramfs, by the way.  :)  
I recently submitted patches to make buildroot support it.  They're
mostly merged [1] but adding a simple patch fixes up the remaining
glitches.  OpenEmbedded has supported it for a while too.
In short, I think udev-on-ramfs is simple enough to set up on 2.6.12
based embedded configs, and with "modprobe -q $MODALIAS" phasing in,
it seems to me [2] that hotplug-with-udev [3] can do most of what
folk have used devfs to achieve.  I've quilted buildroot so that it
works that way by default for me; it's turnkey, with no problems.
Of course, 2.6.13 will be better with cardmgr finally gone.  :)
