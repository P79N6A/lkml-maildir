summary: can't play mp3 files on nfs mounted partition. the music starts
to play and then hangs after about 5 seconds. using xmms on the nfs
client.
leeloo (2.2.17) is the NFS server:
[root@leeloo /root]# exportfs 
/usr/local/mp3 rush
rush (2.4.10-test10) is the NFS client:
[root@rush mp3]# mount -t nfs
192.168.1.50:/usr/local/mp3 on /mnt/mp3 type nfs (rw,addr=192.168.1.50)
i've tried mounting with different rsize,wsize values, but no luck. i've
also tried mounting via SMB and have the same problems.
any ideas?
