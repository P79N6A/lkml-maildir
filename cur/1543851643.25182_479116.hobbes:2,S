It is.
I then tried 0002-r8169-more-magic.txt, mainly to see that it doesn't
cause
any problems. Unfortunately, it did... however, a little reading showed
that
you've stopped enabling transmit and receive for all but four of the
chip
types supported by the driver.
An incremental fix is attached.
> o Darren, still ok to keep your S-o-b in it ?
Yes.

r8169: fix more magic so that 8101e etc. work again
r8169-more-magic killed transmit & receive on my laptop's RTL8101e.
Turns out
to be that the enabling of these functions had been unitnentionally
removed.
(This is one of two possible fixes, the other being the removal of the
if()
guarding the other tx/rx-enable call. Both work here.)
