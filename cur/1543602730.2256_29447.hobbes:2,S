That might explain why the P4 "rdtsc" is so slow.

None. At least not as long as the CPU _does_ do it automatically, and the
TSC appears to run at a constant speed even if the CPU does not.
For example, the Intel "SpeedStep" CPU's are completely broken under
Linux, and real-time will advance at different speeds in DC and AC modes,
because Intel actually changes the frequency of the TSC _and_ they don't
document how to figure out that it changed.
With a CPU that does makes TSC appear constant-frequency, the fact that
the CPU itself can go faster/slower doesn't matter - from a kernel
perspective that's pretty much equivalent to the different speeds you get
from cache miss behaviour etc.
