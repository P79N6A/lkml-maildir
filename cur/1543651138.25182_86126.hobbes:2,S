It's possible, but I don't think we will start in the arch part. More 
interesting would be driver entries like:
driver foo
	tristate "foo support"
	depends on BAR
	source foo.c
part of this could also be:
	cflags "..." [if ...]

Having make specific macros in the configuration is not really a good 
idea. Such tests should rather be done by a shell script and its output 
would be imported into the build system.
