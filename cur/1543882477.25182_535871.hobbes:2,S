Yes, but the _user_ did not start them so they didn't lose any work. See, 
it might or might not be important but that's something the _userspace_ 
has much more knowledge than the kernel ever will.

You are looking at snapshot/shutdown from kernel and user experience point 
of view at the same time which causes confusion here.
Let me repeat: it is _absolutely no concern_ of the _kernel_ whether you 
resume to a snapshot that does not contain all your precious data. The 
kernel doesn't care one bit!
That being said, the _userspace solution_ obviously needs to take this 
into account by blocking user input, making filesystems read-only, and 
maybe even blocking certain background processes (cron and beagle indexing 
come into mind).

It doesn't. We can either make the filesystem read-only or, surprise, 
surprise, make a _snapshot_ of the filesystem!
And while the points you raised are important for the full 
end-user solution, it is absolutely not interesting to snapshot_system(). 
The only thing it needs to guarantee is a consistent snapshot that we can 
resume later.

You are. Perhaps you just don't know it yet. ;-)
