Anyone working on an SNA protocol stack for Linux?
Yeah, I know about that Ice-product, but the mainframe
costed a ton, can't afford their product now.
Oh, and if nobody's working on such a thing; is there
any documentation on where to start when implementing
a protocol-stack? I guess I should add things to net/ and
update the protocols.c/Makefile, but after that I get
stuck :-)
Any help (also like "look at that stack; it's so simple and
basic, it's a good start") is welcome!
Thanks in advance,
