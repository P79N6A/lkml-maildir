| Rik, I saw you had the same experience? Please ACK it :)
with acpi on it can also run, but not if you supply vga=. I tried with
vga=0x317 and it stalls after "Freeing unused kernel memory". When i
turn off acpi using acpi=off and also supply vga=0x317 it continues
booting, but hangs during execution of bootscripts. An example of this
is a script executing /bin/setfont.
The complete append line i use is:
root=/dev/hda3 debug video=mtrr,vesa:1024x768 vga=0x317
I can send my .config and/or dmesg output on demand, but since i am not
the only one with this problem and mcp already send his i did not find
it necessary.
