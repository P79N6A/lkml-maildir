2.5.6 has the original version of the patch kit, which includes the
workarounds for Dell laptops but doesn't include the newer blacklist
rules for the Thinkpad T20 and the MSI-6163.
2.4.19-pre3 has the relevant core changes, but lacks the actual DMI
rules and local APIC workarounds. I believe the -ac versions also
only include the core changes.
