Hi!
has someone included detection support for P4 already (following P4
manuals  on intel developer web site)?
If not I did, but as it is my first attempt in kernel hacking im not
sure if I did everything. Mainly it should not be a big deal... someone
has a few hints?? I edited processor.h and setup.c. There are some
features I also have to read the docs for ... So ill keep on reading
Cheers Markus
