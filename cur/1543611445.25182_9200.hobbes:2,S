That's complete crap.  Human beings know and understand context, and can
use it effectively.  'idx' or 'i' or 'bh' may make perfect sense in
context.  There is absolutely no need for
JournalBHThatIsStoredAndSyncedWithSuperblock.
Kernel code like DAC960 proves that long variable names -decrease- code
readability.
