Right, but that requires prior knowledge that the board in question is
afflicted. Several people that were affected by the bug were unaware of
the motherboard behaviour.
The daemon solution also fails to provide any guarantees on a NFSROOT
setup.
In any case, as I said, these are just defaults which may be overridden
by the user at runtime.
