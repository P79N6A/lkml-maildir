futex_lock_pi is called with an absolute timeout, which is based on
CLOCK_REALTIME. Nothing wrong with that, but the clockevents WARN_ON
might trap over a false positive, when the expiry value is less than
base->offset. This was intentional before we put the WARN_ON into the
clockevents code.
The patch below should fix this issue.
Thanks,
