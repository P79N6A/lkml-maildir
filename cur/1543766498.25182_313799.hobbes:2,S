I haven't looked at this in about a year, but as of a year ago, no.
Namespaces are/were second-class objects that exist only as referenced by
tasks.  I played with implementing a newns PAM module.  It worked, but was
full of holes.  I started writing a paper on it, but never got around to
finishing it, for various reasons.
