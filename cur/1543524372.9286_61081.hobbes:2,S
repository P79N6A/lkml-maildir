Subject: netatalk and IP aliasing problem on Linux 2.2.12-20

Environment - OS - Linux 2.2.12-20 (Redhat 6.1)
	          netatalk version : 1.4b2+asun2.1.3
	          network card : eepro100
If I do the following 
1) Start up the atalk daemon
              /etc/rc.d/init.d/atalkd start
2) Set up IP aliases, say using
	/sbin/ifconfig eth0:1 10.1.42.42 netmask 255.255.0.0 up
	and
	/sbin/ifconfig eth0:0 10.1.42.43 netmask 255.255.0.0 up
	The ifconfig command shows all the interfaces 
3) Bring down, say, eth0:2
I then lose all three interfaces eth0,eth0:1, eth0:2
If I disable atalkd and go through the same sequence, everything works
as expected (eth0:2 goes down, eth0 and eth0:1 are still present).
Interestingly enough, the same thing can be duplicated without
netatalk and just using ifconfig to set up the interfaces, but without 
specifying the netmask.
I took a look at the kernel sources (and I must mention here that I am not,
by any stretch of imagination, a kernel expert, so I may be totally wrong),
and it looks like this behaviour happens if the kernel thinks the interface
is a primary interface (in net/ipv4/devinet.c:inet_del_ifa). I mailed the atalk
folks and have had no response.
Is this a kernel problem, and if so, is it a known one, and is there a 
patch or a workaround?
Thanks,
Hari Parameswaran
