Whoa! Hello, hold on, just wait a second there. Do you _really_ want
an unsigned int return out of tbase_get_deferrable() or will an
unsigned long do? If the rest of your code is fine with unsigned long,
then I'd suggest something like:
static inline unsigned long tbase_get_deferrable(tvec_base_t *base)
{
	return ((unsigned long)base & TBASE_DEFERRABLE_FLAG);
}
I don't really know your code (so I could be horribly incorrect here),
but personally I would prefer *heeding* to that warning than _hiding_
it -- it's not unnecessary, it's telling you that you're *losing* data
by converting a pointer (which is always unsigned long) to unsigned
int for 64-bit platforms where sizeof(void *) == sizeof(unsigned long)
== 8 bytes, but sizeof(unsigned int) == 4.
