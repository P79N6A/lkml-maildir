The truncate logic can't be duplicated because it works on struct pages.
What sounds best, if you use nopfn, is to do your own internal
synchronisation against your unmap call. Obviously you can't because you
have no ->nopfn_done call with which to drop locks ;)
So, hmm yes I have a good idea for how fault() could take over ->nopfn as
well: just return NULL, set the fault type to VM_FAULT_MINOR, and have
the ->fault handler install the pte. It will require a new helper along
the lines of vm_insert_page.
I'll code that up in my next patchset.
