Hi folks,
I just got my new nVIDIA nFORCE-board this morning, I put it into my computer
and got it working up all nicely. Apart from one exception: The USB-chip does
work nicely with my USB scanner, but not with the USB-dongle of my Logitech
MX900 bluetooth mouse. Whenever I put the plug of the dongle in, I just see
the following in dmesg:
hub 1-0:1.0: state 5 ports 10 chg 0000 evt 0200
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.1: GetStatus port 9 status 001002 POWER sig=se0  CSC
hub 1-0:1.0: port 9, status 0100, change 0001, 12 Mb/s
hub 1-0:1.0: debounce: port 9: total 100ms stable 100ms status 0x100
hub 1-0:1.0: state 5 ports 10 chg 0000 evt 0200
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.1: GetStatus port 9 status 001803 POWER sig=j  CSC CONNECT
hub 1-0:1.0: port 9, status 0501, change 0001, 480 Mb/s
hub 1-0:1.0: debounce: port 9: total 100ms stable 100ms status 0x501
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.1: port 9 full speed --> companion
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.1: GetStatus port 9 status 003001 POWER OWNER sig=se0  CONNECT
hub 1-0:1.0: port_wait_reset: err = -107
lsusb does not list the device afterwards, and even the blue light in front 
of the dongle, that is usually switched on once the thing works, is off. The
lspci-tool shows the following for the chipset:
0000:00:02.0 USB Controller: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device 005a (rev a2)
0000:00:02.1 USB Controller: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device 005b (rev a3)
Board is Asus A8N SLI Deluxe. It seems that with Linux 2.6.10, the mouse or
rather the dongle works just fine, so I assume this has been introduced in
the 2.6.11-series. Is this a known problem and is a fix available for it?
