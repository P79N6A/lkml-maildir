You might want to post that Oops message if you want someone to try and 
fix it.
Also, from your dmesg output I see that you are loading the NVIDIA module
 NVRM: loading NVIDIA Linux x86_64 NVIDIA Kernel Module  1.0-7174  Tue Mar 22 06:45:40 PST 2005
You may want to try /not/ loading that module and then reproduce the 
kernel panic and then post that Oops or panic message instead.
