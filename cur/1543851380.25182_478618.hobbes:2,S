The issue is that something as simple as:
	val = pci_read_config(REG);
	val |= bit;
	pci_write_config(REG, val);
	newval = pci_read_config(REG);
	BUG_ON(!(newval & bit));
is not guarenteed by PCI (aparently).
I see no valid reason why every PCI device driver should
be troubled with this lunacy and the ordering should thus
be ensured by the PCI layer.
It just so happens to take care of the original driver
issue too :-)
