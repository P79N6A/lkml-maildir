Yeah, I realized that after I sent the message.  The readahead looks like it 
might be ok.

Yep, I'll give that a try and see if I can come up with a reasonable default 
(something more the stripe unit seems like a start).

Right, for the direct I/O case, it looks like things are limited to 64 pages 
at a time.

The numbers are ~1/3 of what the machine is capable of with direct I/O.  That 
seems like it's much lower than it should be to me.  Cache cold reads into 
the page cache seem like they should be nearly as fast as direct reads (at 
least on a CPU where the extra data copying overhead isn't getting in the 
way).

Ok, I'll give that a try.
Thanks,
