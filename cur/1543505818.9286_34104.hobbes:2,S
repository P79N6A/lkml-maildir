Subject: Buffering packets in network driver (qdisc?)

I want to modify a network driver so that it will only start
sending packets after it receives a certain packet. So, when
the packets arrive from the network layer, I need to hold them
until this message is received.
Now, I'm fairly sure that you're not allowed to use wait_on()
here. Since I need a fairly low turnaround time, I'm thinking
to notify the driver straight from the interrupt handler.
Ideally I would like to arrange it so that it switched
to the network card driver right after the interrupt handler.
Is there a way to have the network layer buffer them and allow
the driver to extract them on demand. In dev.c it talks about
enqueue to do with the QoS stuff. Could this be used? Any
references?
