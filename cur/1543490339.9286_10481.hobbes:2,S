Yes and no. IBM build supercomputers around it. I2O is also very well
designed (much to my initial suprise). The I/O read and write paths of
the block API are a matter of a couple of hundred instructions, the 
controller does all the housekeeping work. It creates very low CPU
loads under high I/O loads. So for some server tasks its tailor made. You
can chain a terabyte of raid storage off your system without spending all
your CPU executing scsi code.
