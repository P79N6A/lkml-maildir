It used to be true at least at some point :/

Hmm - in theory it could be tuned down for SMT siblings which really don't
care about sharing because they have shared caches. But I don't know
how many complications that would add to the slab code.

A system with 16 memory nodes should have more than 100 processes, but ok.

Might be a good idea yes. There used to a "simp" allocator long ago for this,
but it was removed because it had other issues. But this was before even slab
got the per cpu/node support.
