[info about acorn partitioning schemes]
Ok, thanks for the explanation about the scheme dependencies. I guess adding 
a comment like "/* this must come before msdos */" in the respective line of 
fs/partition/check.c could cut down in the number of people asking you the 
same question over and over again.. :-)

Hm, what do you think of these additional checks:
1. Check for overlap of partitions
2. Check for number of recognized partitions (i.e. size != 0) > 0 
3. Check for struct ptec_partition.unused1, unused2, unused5 == 0 (assuming 
they default to zero)
Anyway, thanks again for the info.
