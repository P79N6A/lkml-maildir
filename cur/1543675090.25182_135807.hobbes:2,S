in theory yes.

Hmm, in bigbox.html we should find the difference of the timings
before/after, and I recall it wasn't measurable. I can search for it on
Thu if you want the exact numbers.
However the last numbers from Randy showed my tree going faster than 2.5
with bonnie and tiotest so I think we don't need to worry and I would
probably not fix it in a different way in 2.4 even if it would mean a 1%
degradation. When it was shipped there was no time to measure any
degradation but the problem it fix is so severe that we never had any
doubt if to include it or not ;).
