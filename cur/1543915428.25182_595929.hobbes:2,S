Hey, I think your patch was better than the one that just assumed that you 
can do "read*/write*()" on an iomap(). If people really want it, I don't 
care *that* much.
I just think that the arguments that have been raised so far have really 
been very weak. There really is no "performance" argument without some 
kinds of numbers.
I just think that proliferation of IO interfaces is a bad idea.
