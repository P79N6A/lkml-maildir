Hi,
during 'make modules' on s390x, I see lots of warnings about 'ignoring 
changed section attributes for __ksymtab' that I have found to be the 
result of changeset 1.373.196.1, where Kai changed the defaults for module 
exports to 'no symbols exported'.
The problem is that there is a section '__ksymtab,"a"', while s390x 
requires it to be '__ksymtab,"aw"' because modules must be compiled with
'-fpic' here, unlike afaics all the other architectures.
The patch below is a workaround for the Problem and should be
correct on all architectures, but I'd prefer if there was a nicer
way to do that.
