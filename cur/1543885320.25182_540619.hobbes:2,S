Just a hint: while your code here is correct, it is a good practise to
check against < 0 instead, so that if for any reason you sometimes forget
to cast to signed, the compiler will emit a warning stating that the
condition is always false. This would simply become :
-		if (key < entry->fair_key) {
+		if ((s64)(key - entry->fair_key) < 0) {
Just my .02 euros :-)
