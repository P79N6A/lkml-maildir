Subject: [RFC] Kernel origins and maintainers

Precedence: bulk

I'm busy putting together a list of all the contributors and maintainers 
  that I can find, using the CREDITS and MAINTAINERS files. I have not 
seen this done in one place before; is it redundant effort? The people 
at Grokline (affiliated with Groklaw) are interested in this project, in 
an effort to trace and verify the origin of everything that ever happened.
Please see here: 
http://www.grokline.net
and here: 
http://www.groklaw.net
How does this overlap with the new Developer's Certificate of Origin? I 
have the distinct impression that these projects should be working 
closer together.
Please cc me off the list in addition to on-the-list, just in case; my 
spam filter occasionally screws up. Thanks to all in advance for any 
input or advice.
Peter
