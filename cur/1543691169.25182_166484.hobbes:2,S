Good point, and even if it were a separate feature, any code which was
clever enough to use prefetch is likely to check the CPU bits rather
than the /proc anyway. That's a guess, I suspect most programs do
whatever gcc/glibc choose.
If the fixup were not in place, would it be useful to emit a warning
like "you have booted a non-Athlon kernel on an Athlon process, user
programs may get unexpected page faults." That's in init code, hopefully
there is no critical size issue there, I assume, other than how large a
kernel can be booted by the boot loader.
