I know ;-) We talked over that one a lot ... but I think we ended
up just avoiding the problem (every solution we came up with sucked).
I wasn't so worried about avoiding kmap pool exhaustion as reducing
TLB flushing - if we put 4096 entries in the pool, and can cope with
blocking if the silly thing does happen to fill up, that seems OK.
The *really* nice thing is that you can do all sorts of smart stuff
with the TLB at this point. As we now duplicated the pool per VM,
it just got much, much larger. Chances are by the time you come to
re-use an entry you've already TLB flushed all the CPUs from context
switching. Keep track of that and you *never* tlb flush for kmap.
But in the end the two main users of kmap seem to be copy_to/from_user
stuff and highpte - using atomic for the former and the per-VM space
for the latter seems to fix the problem far enough that nobody could
see it anymore, so nobody cares ;-)

Well, I disagree with the "slightly" in that statement, but otherwise
yes ;-) If you're not running heavy threading, it works brilliantly.
If you are, it's better, but not necessarily brilliant.

Yup, I think we ended up pushing it out by other means, but it's
still interesting. Things like this only need to be pushed out
until the timely death of 32 bit machines ;-)
If I'm not insane about the per-task stuff in the previous email,
that could be used for a per-task kmap, which would be much nicer
all round. But the chances of me being insane are pretty good ;-)
