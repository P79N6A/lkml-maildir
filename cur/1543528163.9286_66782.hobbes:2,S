Show me the patch ... by the time you are done, you _probably_ would
have complicated the code more than the current /dev/zero tweaks.

In reality, /dev/zero should have nothing to do with SYSV. Currently,
its that way because I wanted to minimize code duplication. Most of
the *_core() routines can be taken into ipc/shm_core.c, and together 
with util.c, will let /dev/zero be decoupled from SYSV.

The problem is more with the limits, much less with the output ...

Not sure what you are talking about here ... /dev/zero mmaps are subject
to the same vm-resource checking as other mmaps, and this checking is
a little different for "real" shm creation.

The shm handling slow down is minimal. Most of this is an extra check in 
shm_nopage(), but that _only_ happens for /dev/zero segments, not for
"real" shm segments.
As to why shm fs is a lot more work, we can talk. Linus/Ingo did bring this
up, at a general level, we think that adding an extra inode or other
data structure in map_zero_setup() would be able to handle this.
If a small amount of special case code is the problem, I would suggest 
keep the code as it is for now. Once you have the shm fs work done for 
"real" shm segments, I can look at how to handle /dev/zero segments.
