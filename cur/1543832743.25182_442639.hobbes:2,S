that means that whoever is selling you the IP130's is consistently putting on 
bad EEPROMs, which is *very* bad. Which vendor is that? They can fix this 
problem for you and for *everyone* else they have sold and will sell IP130's 
to in the future.

No it is not. The NIC is supported (you can even call Intel for first line 
support) but if your vendor put a bad EEPROM image on it then all bets are 
off.  Intel provides the vendors with the proper tools to make valid EEPROMs, 
the driver checks them for a very good reason.

How can you tell? Do you know if jumbo frames work correctly?  Is the device 
properly checksumming? is flow control working properly?  These and many, many 
more settings are determined by the EEPROM.  Seemingly it may work correctly, 
but there is no guarantee whatsoever that it will work correctly at all if the 
checksum is bad.  Again, you can lose data, or worse, you could corrupt memory 
in the system causing massive failure (DMA timings, etc). Unlikely? sure, but 
not impossible.

That is another discussion.  All wifi drivers bail out if the firmware is 
corrupted, why shouldn't e1000 be allowed to do so either? Are you willing to 
risk your data?
