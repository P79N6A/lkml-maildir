Just to recap, these are the three problem areas that still produce
latencies over 500 usec on my machine.
	journal_clean_checkpoint_list
	rt_garbage_collect
	vga console
I have found that the latter does not require switching back and forth
to X; anything that produces a lot of console output can trigger 500
usec latencies.
