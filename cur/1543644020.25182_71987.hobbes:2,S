I was in the process of writing to you as this one came in...
I have booted 2.5.34 and 2.5.36, the same controller as yours, on my dual
PIII box and it is apparently functioning well.  I have not done any kind
of load testing yet.
Congratulations!  I presume you are now the DAC960 maintainer, subject to
approval from on high of course, and assuming you are willing.  I'd like
to do some spelling changes, just obvious ones for now, like removing
spelling wrappers from standard kernel interfaces.  Want patches?
