Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is a patch to arch/i386/traps.c and arch/i386/signal.c which does
what you are suggesting, I believe.
I have tested this and it works fine for me. (Though I do also need
the patch which stores dr6 back into current->thread.debugreg[6]. That
is not included here since I submitted it separately and assume it is
uncontentious). All user generated watchpoints are noted, as are ones
triggered from the kernel by system calls overwriting the watched
data.
A couple more points :-
1) I restore the debug control register at the point where a signal is
   about to be delivered, rather than at the top of the loop as you
   suggested. I think that's safe (and potentially less work if we go
   around the loop more than once).
2) Rather than zapping the eip in the watchpoint trap to -1 if the
   trap occurs in the kernel, I make it the user eip from the thread.
   That makes a debugger point at the right place, i.e. the system
   call inside which the watchpoint triggered.
