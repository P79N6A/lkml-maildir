We need a different memory allocator for that. Maybe it's
time to dig up my zone allocator proposal (on my home page)
and adapt it to something working.
Unfortunately I don't have the time to do that, so I'll
leave the job to Alan or Stephen (who should have the time
since they're with Red Hat)...

Once the allocator is ready and stabilized, we might be
able to retrofit it to 2.2. It's just a single module
we need to touch...
