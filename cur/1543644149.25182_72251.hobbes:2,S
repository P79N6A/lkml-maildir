Depends what you get it return. The object of fastwalk was to stop the
cacheline bouncing on all the individual dentry counters, at the cost
of increased dcache_lock hold times. It's a tradeoff ... and in this
instance it wins. In general, long lock hold times are bad.

Yes, in 2.4. Gave good results, I forget exactly what ... something
like 5-10% off kernel compile times.

Nothing to do with low hold times - it's to do with bouncing the 
lock between nodes.

Well, avoiding data corruption is a preferable goal too. The point of
RCU is not to have to take a lock for the common read case. I'd expect
good results from it on the NUMA machines - never been benchmarked, as
far as I recall.
