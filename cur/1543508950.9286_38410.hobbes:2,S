Hi Jens,
No, it's no coincidence.  I rebuilt with cdrom.o modularized and loaded
with 'debug=1' as you asked.  Here's the system log excerpt:
First, autofs mounts it when I cd to /misc/cd:
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii automount[986]: attempting to mount entry /misc/cd
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: entering cdrom_open 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: entering open_for_data 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: drive_status=4 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: entering cdrom_count_tracks 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: wrong media type, but CDO_CHECK_TYPE not set. 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: all seems well, opening the device. 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: opening the device gave me 0. 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: door locked. 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: device opened successfully. 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: Use count for "/dev/hdc" now 1 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: entering CDROMMULTISESSION 
Sep 11 12:20:18 pii kernel: cdrom: CDROMMULTISESSION successful 
Next, I fire up the VM:
Sep 11 12:20:29 pii kernel: cdrom: entering cdrom_open 
Sep 11 12:20:29 pii kernel: cdrom: Use count for "/dev/hdc" now 2 
The VM pops up an error dialog, and its own log captures:
Sep 11 12:20:29: Forking AIO IDE1:0 pid=1150 sharedArea=0x41554000 size=0x1000
Sep 11 12:20:29: CDROM: Verify Ioctl '/dev/cdrom' failed: 'Function not implemented'
Then, VM gives up.. (from /var/log/messages again):
Sep 11 12:20:29 pii kernel: cdrom: entering cdrom_release 
Completely repeatable.  2.2.13-pre4 works just fine.
Let me know if you'd like me to try anything else.
Steve
