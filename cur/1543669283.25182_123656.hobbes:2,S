This sounds right :)

Yes, we should push the "p->user->uid == 0" test into the
send_task_to_user() function then... and later on implement
a "p->user->unlimited_cpu_share == 1" test.

Perhaps I'm not declaring this in any explicit way, but I feel
that this type of control should only be applied to cpu hogs.

I'm somewhat deadlocked right now, so I'll have to wait until I have
