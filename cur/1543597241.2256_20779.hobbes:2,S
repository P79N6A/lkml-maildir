That was me/us.  Most of the reason for making 'global scheduling'
decisions was an attempt to maintain the same behavior as the existing
scheduler.  We are trying to see how well we can make this scheduler
scale, while maintaining this global behavior.  Thought is that if
there was ever any hope of someone adopting this scheduler, they would
be more likely to do so if it attempted to maintain existing behavior.

Take a look at the 'CPU pooling & Load balancing' extensions to our
scheduler(lse.sourceforge.net/scheduling).  It allows you to divide
the system into CPU pools keep scheduling decisions limited to
these pools.  Periodicly, load balancing will be performed among
the pools.  This has shown some promise on NUMA architectures (as
one would expect).  You could define pool sizes to be 1 CPU and
get the scheduling behavior you desire on SMP.
But, none of this has to do with CPU affinity issues with the
current scheduler.
