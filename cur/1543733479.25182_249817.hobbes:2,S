Hi,
One of our client's machines sometimes hits the BUG() in xfrm_state.c 
(line 54).
This seems to happen at the removal of a IPsec policy. Some data: kernel 
2.6.6. with Netfilter POM IPSEC-patches, ipsec-tools 0.2.3.
If I read the code correctly this would mean that the garbage collector 
tries to stop an earlier deactivated timer. (del_timer returning '0')
Does anybody know what causes this? And, is a kernel BUG not a bit too 
drastic for this error condition?  Wouln't a WARN_ON suffice?
Thanks in advance,
Greetings,
Ludo Stellingwerff.
