 We're not talking about regression, i.e. reappearance of old bugs.

 Large changes produce bugs -- that's a fact of life.
 It's not that the changes aren't needed, it's just the the previous 2.6 release
is kind of like a baby abandoned on a doorstep -- nobody has the time to fix
those last few bugs.  Even if someone were to step up to the plate and try to
create a stable 2.6 series, I'd bet the lead developers wouldn't even spend time
working on it.
