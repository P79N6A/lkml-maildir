(As an aside, the original reason I started using devfs was because it created
a separate /dev filesystem, and / can be mounted 'nodev'.  But I don't have any
religious preference for mounting devfs-by-kernel or tmpfs-from-initrd).
On the flip side, udev gives me something that devfs *cant* without major
hacking - the ability to attach extended attributes/labels to the device when
it gets created, so things like SELinux can deal with them. (OK, so I admit I'm
still sorting out how to use the SElinux transition SID support for tmpfs ;)
