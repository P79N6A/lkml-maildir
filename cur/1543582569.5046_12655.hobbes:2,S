All reports I've seen have been for SMP kernels on MP machines using
the IO-APIC to drive the watchdog. Are you saying there are also cases
where UP boxes fail with nmi_watchdog non-zero? (My 1Hz change only
affected the local APIC-driven watchdog which MP boxes normally don't use.)

Another "constructive" use of the perfctrs. Ok, this I can see wants
a higher rate.
How far in the future is this? I'm concerned that the conflicting
uses of the perfctrs (watchdog, kernel profiling, my perfctr driver
for user-space performance measurements) is going to require some
low-level request/release API.

Ok. 
Alan beat me to it for -ac20, so I'm not including a new patch now
with the 1Hz bit backed out. Ingo, I guess this means the kernel
profiling patch will have to "fix" the 1Hz thing by itself.
