Works fine here (2.2mb/sec), connected via ethernet to the ADSL "modem".
BUT.. that ease will change soon.  My ISP is shifting to PPP-over-Ethernet
rather than continuing with the current "bridged" setup.  Other ISPs
continent-wide are likely to do the same, in the name of "equal access".
Linux currently has no *mature* open-source PPPoE client, but there
are some jury-rigged arrangements that work, sort of, at present.
I'll likely be installed one Real Soon Now..
