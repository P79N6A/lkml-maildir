what is an SMM trap? I googled a bit but didn't get it...

I am sure throughput kept diminishing little by little with many 2.6 
releases, and that it wasn't a major regression on a specific version. 
Unfortunately I cannot backup my words with measurements from older 
kernels right now, since the system is hard to boot with such (new udev, 
new glibc). However I promise I'll test in the future (probably using 
old liveCDs) and come back then with proof.

the reason I'm talking about a "software driver limit" is because I am 
sure about some facts:
- The disks can reach very high speeds (60 MB/s on other systems with udma5)
- The chipset on this specific motherboard can reach much higher 
numbers, as was measured with old kernels.
- No cable problems (have been changed), no strange dmesg output.
So what is left? Probably only the corresponding kernel module.
Thanks,
Dimitris
