Yep.  Right now, I think it's really the Mesa/Xorg side that needs work and is 
the "critical path".  If we can convince/educate the distros to take 3D 
drivers from Mesa, that will be a good step in the right direction.

Not a crazy idea at all, plus I like the name.  But a fork could help relieve 
the tension between trying to maintain a stable DRM and the sorts of stuff 
that you need to do to move to the next level.  And I recognize that I get 
grumpy when it sounds like existing functionality is threatened by your desire 
to push off in a certain technical direction.  If gnuLonghorn/DRM makes a 
friendly/development fork off the existing DRM, things might go a little smoother.
