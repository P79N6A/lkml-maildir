Hallo.
I have a OPTi 82C929 based soundcard (Shuttle Sound System 48). The MAD16 driver in my 2.2.9 kernel don't realy activate the joystick-port. I have a second  joystickport build in and that run only if the mad16 deactivate the joystick port. If the joystickport on the soundcard is active both ports don't work. So my analog-joystick don't work. On an other soundcard(pnp) it works.
I have: a pentuim 133 CPU
        the sound,soundcore,sb,mad16,opl3,v_midi,uart401,ad1848 modules active
        SuSE 6.1
        kernel 2.2.9
