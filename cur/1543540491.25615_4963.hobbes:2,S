	I may be out in left field, but my idea of a thorough development
and release process would be to take all the tools one just built and
use those to produce a 3rd generation.  Then take those tools and produce
a 4th generation.  If 3rd!=4th (subtracting out time/date stamps) then
it would seem something is wrong -- or am I missing something?
	Now that whole process would be automated and if the 3rd and 4th compare,
then kick off the automated test suites.  
	Maybe RedHat doesn't use a thorough source and release methodology
for their Beta's?
