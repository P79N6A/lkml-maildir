Section:
7.6 You forgot to run LILO, or system doesn't boot at all
You might want to update the following line:
"Using LILO with big drives (more than 1024 cylinders) can cause problems.
See the LILO mini-HOWTO or documentation for help on that."
This isn't true anymore unless your using an older version of LILO.
Shawn.
