This is a pretty old article, from 2000, describing the preemption model
they implemented on 2.4.  I believe the above paragraph describes the
advantages of their model vs. the approach taken by the old 2.4 low
latency patches.
My understanding is that the preemptible 2.6 kernel already works this
way.
