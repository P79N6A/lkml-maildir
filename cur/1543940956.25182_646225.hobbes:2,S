That makes sense.
The version you two are looking at can return
"percentages" way larger than 100 in get_scan_ratio.
A fixed version of get_scan_ratio, where the
percentages always add up to 100%, makes the
system go OOM before it seriously starts
swapping.
I will integrate your fixes with my code when I
get back from holidays.  Then things should work :)
Thank you for your analysis of the problem.
