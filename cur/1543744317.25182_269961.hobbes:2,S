Subject: [PATCH 10/26] NTFS 2.1.22 - Bug and race fixes and improved error handling.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/10/81

This is patch 10/26 in the series.  It contains the following ChangeSet:
<aia21@cantab.net> (04/10/28 1.2026.1.35)
   NTFS: In fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_writepage(), if t he page is fully outside
         i_size, i.e. race with truncate, invalidate the buffers on the page
         so that they become freeable and hence the page does not leak.
   Signed-off-by: Anton Altaparmakov <aia21@cantab.net>
Best regards,
	Anton
