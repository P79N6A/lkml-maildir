These 2 have nothing in common except the kernel version.  I was too lazy to
send 2 emails <g>
1) PCMCIA
   The pcmcia modules in the kernel identify all inserted cards as anonymous
memory.
2) USB
   Is there a driver for the netgear EA-101 USB->ethernet adapter? (Or any
ethernet adapters for that mater)
