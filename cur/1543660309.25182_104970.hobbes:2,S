From your previous posts I have only noted down one feature that is
not yet planned: 
1) Building modules separate from module src.
The other issues you have rasied are either queued for inclusion, or
being worked on.
Could you try to come up with some sort of list what you really miss.
It is always nice to get inputs from others, not only judging based
on your own needs.
Any constructive inputs are greatly appreciated.
