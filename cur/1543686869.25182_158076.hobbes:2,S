Two virtual networks sharing the same lan is a perfectly valid one.
There since the router doesn't know how to reach 140.x it wouldnt reply,
if it also *is* 140.1 for example then it can reply if it wishes but I
see nothing in 826 requiring it does. In normal situations the routing
tables will indicate preferred routes and gateways.

Thats not true at the IP level for basic situations like asymmetric
routing.

See above, multiple virtual networks.
