I tried yesterday by phone and email, so far I have been unable to obtain 
a definite phone number for someone who actually is responsible for the 
drivers; and I have not yet received any answers to my email to their 
customer service. I will try again on Monday, through their Belgian 
division (so as to not piss off the same people too much), as I don't think 
there's much going on in the weekend. Their tech support did ask me about 
the Linux distribution, kernel version and XFree version, so they have at 
least heard about Linux. :)
It would help a great deal if Nemosoft could give me a contact address. 
Nemosoft, if you read this, could you help me out? Or perhaps try to reach 
your contact at Philips yourself with the question if any closed source is 
still a necessity - a lot of people would be grateful for a definite 
answer, I'm sure (not in the least yourself, I guess).
Perhaps there is somebody on this list who works at Philips and can give 
me a reply in private?
