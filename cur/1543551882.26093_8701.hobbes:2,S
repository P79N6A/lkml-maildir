Similar situation with 2.2.x / ide-scsi.  The Gnome planel applet just
tries CDROMPLAYTRKIND, and fails.  Firing off gtcd will let you play
the cd, because it (presumably) does things 'right'.
Haven't been bothered enough by the panel applet's glitch to fix it
myself - I don't leave it running because of the periodic disk
checking and corresponding syslog spammage.

Mark
