Those patch actually is merged.  It just looks different because the
table got merged back into ich6m table after finding out ich6m has the
same issue.  Also, the patch deals only with detection.
Can you boot 2.6.21.1 with only libata drivers compiled in and report
the dmesg?  libata usually dumps more info than ide drivers so it's
easier to find out what's going on.
