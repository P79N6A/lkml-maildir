Do you mean cdrecord or the kernel ?
DiscAtOnce only works with newer models. I suspect that something is broken with late versions of cdrecord (>=1.10) cause burning with cdrdao works for other persons.
So adding "-dao" and "-pad" when you're burning audio to your commandline you should be on the safe side for now.
