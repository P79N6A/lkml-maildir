There's one pitfall here: for a device using MSI-X, the MSI-X table is
going to be somewhere in one of the device's BARs.  When the device
driver does pci_enable_msix(), drivers/pci/msi.c will do
request_region() on this table.  If the device driver has already done
pci_request_regions(), then this will fail and the driver won't be
able to use MSI-X.  The current solution is for the driver to avoid
requesting the whole BAR where the MSI-X table is.
