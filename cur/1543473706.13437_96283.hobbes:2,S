I'm getting my PPP link reporting
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:-1073716628  Metric:1
This MTU of 0xC000626C is, um, a little bit bizarre.  I was looking
into why tcpdump had stopped working, put debugging into libpcap, saw
this number, traced it back to SIOCGIFMTU, tried ifconfig and... huh?
I haven't traced it into the kernel, but 2.1.131ac11 didn't do this.
Presumably it's something simple.  (Oh, sticking a little "& 0xfffff"
into libpcap results in a working tcpdump.  Not that *that* MTU is
resonable, either, but at least it's non-negative.)
pppd is from Debian ppp_2.3.5-2, dated June 19.
