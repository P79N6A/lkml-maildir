I was talking generally. You cannot really use these instructions on Athlon,
because they're microcoded and slow or do not exist. On Athlon it needs
3dnow write combining functions (adding FPU overhead so may not be worth
it). On P3/P4 you can use movnti/movntdq yes.
Just doing it for reads is more tricky/dubious.
