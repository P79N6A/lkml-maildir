	Hello Paul ,  Could you add a little more info like which scsi
	chipset you are using & what the driver version is & what kernel
	version you are running also (One more )& how you have the drive
	chained to the scsi-bus .  Someplace there is a pointer on howto
	reset the scsi-bus from the /proc system , BUT the method is
	highly not recommended .  Hth ,  JimL
