I have a couple of servers in a similar configuration.  One of them in
fact is running a pretty good sized news server.  We are running the
2.2.5 kernel and haven't heard a peep out of them.
Make sure that you are using the EATA driver not the EATA_DMA driver.
The EATA_DMA driver is obsolete and we did see some some
non-deterministic problems when we were using the EATA_DMA drivers,
especially in an SMP environment.
