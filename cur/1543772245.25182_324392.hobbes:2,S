The idea is that 8250 handles those serial ports.  8250_pnp, 8250_pci
and 8250_acorn etc are all probe modules which register with 8250,
know how the bus type works and tells 8250 where the ports are.
It's a cleaner design rather than stuffing multiple bus types into one
driver.
The reason that 8250 first detects your ports is that they're found
via the legacy method which is independent of PnP.  As you correctly
sumise, when you unload 8250_pnp, it disables the device so when you
re-load 8250, it's unable to detect your ports using the legacy method.
But the legacy method needs to continue to exist for systems which
don't have PnP enabled.
So, the above behaviour is completely expected and isn't a sign of
a deeper problem.
