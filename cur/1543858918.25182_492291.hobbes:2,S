I buy the hardware. I actually want to get enough information about it
so that I can write a driver for it for my homegrown OS.
In the "old days" hardware was accompanied with such info.
For example, printers had control ESC sequences listed, etc.
These days, printers come with elaborate idiot-proof manuals
"how to properly connect your printer to the AC outlet"
and "how to properly insert Windows driver CD".
Ever met those Windows-only "GDI" printers which do not speak
any known open standard (they eat proprietary bitmap input instead)?
Why vendor has a right to restrict me to a few existing OSes?
I think that something is wrong here. Are there countries where
such practuce (of not providing tech info for writing drivers)
is illegal?
