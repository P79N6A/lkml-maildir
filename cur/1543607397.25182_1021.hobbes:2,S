That's bizzare, 2.96 has been working nicely
on all of my 30-40 Red Hat 7.x boxes. All sorts
of configs, from single P5-166 to Quad PPRO
with highmem, various vendors -
web, mail, dns, firewall, vpn, X workstations,
database, and all running kernels compiled
with gcc-2.96 , and everything running like
a top.
