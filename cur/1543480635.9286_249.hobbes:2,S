Hi, and thanks for working on this. It will look very nice to see a
release when 2.2 is out. I have a few comments.

Name them fully the first time you refer to them (I'm not even sure who
Cohen is). Also, I don't like this quote--

The problem is that it is technically worded and may be confusing to
people who are not programmers.

I like these two quotes much better. "Trusted" will give the reader warm
fuzzy feelings. :-)

Not GPL, but the quotes in them probably may be considered public
domain. I'm not sure if you want this quote in here, though, given your
prior quotes--I don't think it looks good to quote extensively from the
opposition in a press release.
Here's my effort:
: Even Microsoft employees have been impressed by Linux. In a company
: memo, staffer Vinod Valloppillil wrote, "Linux represents a
: best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted in mission critical applications,
: and - due to it's open source code - has a long term credibility which
: exceeds many other competitive OS's."
I would not include further Microsoft quotes.

And from satisfied users (one or two), I think. A problem is that it is
easy to make a very long press release, and I think that is to be
avoided. With a release as important as this one perhaps it is
justified.

"Organization" -- the release claims to originate from Santa Clara, so
should be written in American.
Actually, I think they are calling themselves OSI, for "Open Source
Initiative", now. The page does not seem to affiliate itself with
anything, though (aside from referring to "the Open Source campaign"),
so perhaps you should mail the webmaster and ask.
