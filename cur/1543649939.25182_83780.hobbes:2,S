That's fine.  I can be convinced away from "sibling", I'll leave that up 
to others.  Personally I think I prefer "virtual core" over "sibling" 
and "sub-core".
However, "thread" is the least clear of the proposed choices, and should 
not be used.  Anything-but-thread is my position :)  Thread is used to 
describe processes in Linux, those active in hardware and also those 
sleeping in memory, etc.
