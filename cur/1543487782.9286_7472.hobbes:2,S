You can define it how you want, but there are extant other definitions so
you might confuse people. See, for example
@book{Stankovic,
author={John A. Stankovic and Krithi Ramamritham},
title="Hard Real-Time Systems" ,
series={IEEE Tutorials},
publisher="IEEE" ,
volume= 819,
year=1988 }

You don't need to chop CPU usage into microsecond intervals to get
microsecond latency.
