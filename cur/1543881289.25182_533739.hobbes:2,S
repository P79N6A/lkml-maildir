Dear sir/madam,
This is what I got after upgrading from sarge to etch (Debian):
<<
POST STARTUP ERRORS ( BIOS )
The following error(s) were detected when the system was started:
177 System security - Asset control has been violated
Select one of the following:
	Continue
	Exit Setup
>>
A search on internet revealed that I am not the only one with this 
BIOS error, but I couldn't find any solution until now.
Do you have any idea how to solve this problem?
Sincerely,
--
