Hi Suresh,
Thanks for the explanation.  I tried few more experiments based on
your comments and found that in a long running CPU intensive job, the
heuristics did help to get the load on the same package.

But the problem is we will not be able get longer idle time and goto
lower sleep states on other packages if we are not able to move the
short bursts of daemon jobs to busy packages.
We are looking at various means to increase uninterrupted CPU idle
times on atleast some of the CPUs in an under-utilised SMP machine.

No, in contrary to your observation, on my machine, CPU0 and CPU1 are
siblings on the first package while CPU2 and CPU3 are in the second
package.

There is a general improvement in idle time in this experiment as
compared to the first experiment.  So if sched_mc will not impact
short running tasks (daemons and other event managers in idle system),
then the observation on experiment-1 may be just a random
redistribution of tasks over time.

I have tried running two CPU intensive threads.  With sched_mc turned
ON, they were scheduled on CPU0-1 or CPU2-3.  With sched_mc turned
OFF, I can see that they were scheduled arbitrarily.  
Later I added random usleep() to make them consume less CPU, in that
case the scheduling was very random.  The two threads with random
sleeps were scheduled on any of the 4 CPUs and the sched_mc parameter
had no effect is consolidating the threads to one package.  Addition
of sleeps makes the threads very short run and not CPU intensive.
This completely validates your explanation of consolidating only 'long
running' jobs.
How do we take this technique to the next step where we can
consolidate short running jobs as well?  Did you face any difficulty
biasing the CPU for short running jobs?

I am sure tickless has very significant impact on the idle time.
I will get you more data on this comparison.

True, we did not see any scheduling anomalies yet.
