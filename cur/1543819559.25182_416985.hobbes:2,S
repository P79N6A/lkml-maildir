Um, ok.  Not sure what that means in practice, but good to know you have
actual users.

But AFAICS they didn't respond to my actual points, whereas I responded
to their points.  In the end, their argument seemed to degenerate to
"SLIM should be accepted because it differs from SELinux" or "embrace
diversity for diversity's sake."  Not entirely compelling.

Well, I haven't seen any new code submitted since last Nov, and the code
at that time was badly broken to the point that it seemed to require a
re-design, and none of the modules at the time appeared to justify LSM
or the stacker; if anything, they were a warning that the stacker and
LSM lend themselves to misuse, confusion, and broken code.
I'm sure we'd all be glad to see new patches.  But the issues that were
raised during the original discussion still need to be addressed.
