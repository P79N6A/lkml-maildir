The naming is in sync with 2.4, I called that feature lowmem_reserve
when I wrote it.  Protection doesn't actually mean anything. Memory
protection, mprotect, what?
The object of the feature is to reserve lower memory in function of the
classzone allocation, and in function of the zone we're allocating from.
So lowmem_reserve sounds a much better name. And it wasn't me to change
it, it was the 2.6 kernel calling it differently in the first place.
Note that at first 2.6 was doing stuff very differently from 2.4 too
(and it wasn't working right infact). Now it's in perfect sync with the 2.4
algorightm I wrote originally and so I thought it would be much cleaner
to call it the same way as 2.4, which is more self explanatory too.
