I'm with rmk, I do not like this use of structs. There are IO access
functions defined for a number of reasons.

Yes, but how do you know GCC is actually correctly compiling this?

I feel this argument is a dangerous, as it ends up with `well, we
did it that way in XXX, so why can't we do it in linux`? This'll
end up with bad quality code and implementations simply due to the
fact they exist. (IE, it was good enough for Microsoft, Linux should do
it the same way)

Yes, so converting them to a different format is a _once only_ issue.

And this is different from bugs in the way that structs are layed out
by the compiler, or code re-ordering? It is know to be correct for
at least the versions of GCC that you have tried it with.
The arguments that structs are compiler efficient are also dying with
newer GCCs getting better at factoring constants into registers.

pretty difficult to verify these are actually being assigned the
correct address?
