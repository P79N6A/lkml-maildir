Hi,
I've got an EPIA board, with a trident CyberBlade chipset. Does anyone
have doco on this chipset? The random Xfree stuff available from VIA is
less-than-enlightening (I'm not familiar with X internals).
I'm basically just interested in getting FB working for NTSC output.
Someone was working on this in the VIA forums, but i haven't noticed any
output from him recently.
Pointers to documentation/other posts on this are greatly appreciated.
