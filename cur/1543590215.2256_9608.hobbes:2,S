.. BitKeeper isn't a memory hog, the kernel is bloated.  Over 100MB of
   source last I checked.  BitKeeper is incredibly good at _NOT_ being
   a memory hog, it uses the page cache as its memory pool.  If things
   fit in the cache, they go fast, if they don't, they don't.  BitKeeper
   is just like diff in that respect.  If you think BitKeeper is a memory
   hog, then you must hate diff too.  How about netscape?  Don't run that
   either?  Give me a break.
.. It's great that you aren't interested in running that set of small 
   applications, I'm sure the entire kernel list is happy to learn that.
.. You can get really cheap ECC ram as well, even if it were 2x as expensive,
   that's still really cheap, less than 50 cents a megabyte, so what's your
   problem?  Go get some ECC memory and be happy.
