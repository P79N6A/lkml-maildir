Can you test your machine in both bad and good state with memtest86 for 
few hours? (It is included for example in latest Gentoo live cd). What 
about other cpu and memory intensive benchmarks? (Can you do 3 or 5 
[depending on memory amount] simulateus full botstraps of gcc 3 without 
problems or compile full Gentoo unstable on it? - the best benchmarks I 
know of.)
