Subject: [PATCH 2/6] ext2 balloc: reset windowsz when full
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/28/110

ext2_new_blocks should reset the reservation window size to 0 when squeezing
the last blocks out of an almost full filesystem, so the retry doesn't skip
any groups with less than half that free, reporting ENOSPC too soon.
