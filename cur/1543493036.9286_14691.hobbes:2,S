You wanted to insert code into the executable that would check for
a capabilites section, instead of letting the kernel do the job.
The kernel knows what the mount options were. Userspace has little
clue what they were. You could add a system call for that or hope
that /etc/mtab has the data you need. Both options are crummy.
Your solution offers full support on old kernels, but that breaks
if you add a system call to check the mount options.
