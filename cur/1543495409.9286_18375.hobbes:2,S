Out of the box redhat 5.2 couldnt see the correct geometry. I had to
calculate it by hand and pass it in on the kernel command line.
Maybe 2.2.x gets it right now but 2.0.x is what most people are probably
using considering 2.2.x isnt production ready yet (eg isofs is broked in
2.2.7, and ac4 broke smbfs)

Redhat 6.0 is relatively new most people are still using 5.2 I suspect and
this bogus CHS crap is a pain in the arse. Its bitten me twice.

So there needs to be good probing routines then that ignore BIOS totally
since you really cant depend on it getting it right

Which is what ive been saying all along

So what do you do with old AWARD bios without AUTO

Well what do we do on non-x86 architectures especially with the promise
card? Eg mips or sparc or does the promise even run on those yet B)
