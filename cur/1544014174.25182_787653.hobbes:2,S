fair enough.

Yeah, I'm trying different ways to handle the if magic to see if I can 
come up with a way to keep gcc happy. Unfortunately, every solution so far 
still seems to confuse sparc (I don't know why it does not confuse x86 or 
powerpc, although some of my variations do).
I would hate to black list archs just because it gives warnings. I've 
analyzed the code greatly to make sure that it keeps the semantics of the 
original code the same.
It's just that it pushes gcc beyond its threshold of knowing that a 
variable is initialized. I do not blame gcc because it has to have a limit 
to handle logic cases (otherwise it has solved the halting problem).
What bothers me is that some versions of gcc are not affected by the if 
macro and some are. I'm impressed to hear that sparc has been compiling 
fine for years with -Werror since I'm not sure other archs can say the 
same.
I'll have to keep hacking at it. :-/
