It's for populating the pagetable in a vmalloc area.  There's magic in
the fault handler to synchronize the vmalloc mappings between different
process's kernel mappings, so if the mapping isn't currently present, it
will fault and create the appropriate mapping.  It's not operating on
swappable user memory, so swapping isn't an issue; but if the fault
handler exits immediately with preempt disabled, then there's a problem.
(Even though we don't support preempt, I've been generally coding in a
preempt-safe way, just so that the code looks "normal".  And maybe we
will support preempt at some point.)
