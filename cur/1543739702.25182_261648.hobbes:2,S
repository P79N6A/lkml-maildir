Well we see it the other way around.  We want to do a little as possible 
and let Linux handle as much as possible.  Otherwise your bios turns 
into a mini-OS.  The path is littered with dead projects that went that 
route.  Keeping current with driver support kills them.

If only it were that easy. *grin*
Ok well I really don't want to start a off-topic argument here so I'll 
shut up after this. Especially since I'm not really argueing anything 
that hasn't already be thrashed over many times.
I and many others would like to see a unified int10 solution that could 
be used by as many projects that need it rather than the fragmented 
setup we have now.  The kernel proper may or may not be one of those.
