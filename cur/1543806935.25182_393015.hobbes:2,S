Looks like we have mirror image brains :) - I had to scratch my scalp to 
figure out where all the magic numbers in the switch came from.  
Perhaps well named variables will help:
    unsigned char modified_bits = data[offset+i] ^ POSION_FREE;
    int modified_bits_count = hweight8(modified_bits);
    total += modified_bits_count;

Your code will generate a false positive 8 times in 256 runs, or 1 in 
32. A 3% false positive rate seems excessive, It's also sensitive to 
changes to POISON_FREE.
