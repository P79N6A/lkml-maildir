Hello,
For internet browsing through an ISA modem, using PPP, does
PPP use serial.c for communicating with the modem or it uses
some other driver. Also if I use this ISA modem through a
PCI bridge, i.e. the interface with the system is a PCI
interface , and I want to browse using PPP again, do I need
to do modifications in the serial.c or it can be used as it
is ?
Thanks,
Girish
