All right, I'm going to shut up now.  I had no idea that SGI had gone behind
my back and started porting CSA to Linux.  :-P  Before I shut up, though, as a
user of these tools I'd vote for a unified data collection method, as
suggested above.  There has to be at least five of us who have volunteered at
one point or another to help make the GNU utilities conform.  That should make
everyone happy.
