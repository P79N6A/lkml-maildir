?  I'm hoping to merge the Xen code in the next couple of days, so I'd
appreciate it if we don't break the foundations just before building the
building.

As I mentioned in the previous mail, its only really necessary for a
32-bit guest under a 32-bit hypervisor.  While that's going to be a
supported configuration for a long time, we expect that people will
increasingly use 64-bit hypervisors on new machines, so this will become
less of an issue.
We're also looking at shadowing the 4 top-level PAE entries rather than
using them directly, since the shadows only need to be updated when
reloading cr3.  This would allow us to use compact pgds, so long as
there's some other way to maintain the pgd list (ideally, something that
can be shared with non-PAE).
Or did I miss something?  Is pgd_list being maintained some other way
with slub/quicklists?

If you use page->index for that, how does pgd_list get linked together
for vmalloc syncing?
