LaCie sell the following FireWire 800 card:
http://www.lacie.com/uk/products/product.htm?pid=10173
According to the manual, it conforms to both the OHCI and EHCI specs.
Does this card work out of the box with the standard Linux FireWire drivers?
I'd like to get one of these cards to connect my LaCie 1TB 
USB2/FireWire400/FireWire800 drive to.
Cheers,
Mark.
