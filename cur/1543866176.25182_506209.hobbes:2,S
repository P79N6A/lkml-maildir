Subject: [GIT PATCH] ACPI patches for 2.6.21
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus,
please pull from: 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git release
ACPICA Core version 2070126 simplifies the ACPI table manager
code by consolidating multiple table definitions into one.
It also saves memory by mapping the tables where the BIOS provides them
rather than copying them into the kernel.
Per your request, and the request of the distros, we've changed
how ACPICA Core releases are integrated into Linux so that each
upstream (CVS) check-in appears as a single git commit.
While this process is not yet perfect, it should be vastly better
than previous "code drops" in allowing git bisect to work,
and allowing distros to cherry-pick individual fixes.
The "bay" driver is new (and marked EXPERIMENTAL) -- adding initial
hot-plug support for ACPI controlled drive bays such as the
IBM ultrabay or the Dell Module Bay.
The "asus-laptop" driver is also new.  Consistent with msi-laptop,
it uses ACPI in platform-specific ways, but strives to avoid
exposing ACPI-specific implementation details to the user.
asus-laptop is mutually exclusive with asus_acpi, which it will
replace over time.
This series includes steps to convert the ACPI sub-system
over to the Linux driver model, and steps to start replacing
the old /proc/acpi/ interfaces with cleaner interfaces in sysfs --
non-ACPI-specific generic ones whenever possible.  This effort
is not complete, but it has been in -mm for a long time and
I believe that it is time to push it upstream to benefit
from broader exposure and testing.
There are also some patches for Altix support
which have ACPI dependencies.  This support is new,
so I anticipate some updates to it, but I think it is
a good idea to push what SGI has now upstream so they
stop getting stomped on with merge conflicts in -mm.
This will update the files shown below.
thanks!
-Len
ps. a plain patch is also available here:

    Altix: Add ACPI SSDT PCI device support (hotplug)
    
    Support for dynamic loading and unloading of ACPI SSDT tables upon slot
    hotplugs and unplugs.
    
    On SN platforms, we now represent every populated root bus slot with a single
    ACPI SSDT table containing info for every device and PPB attached to the slot.
     These SSDTs are generated by the prom at initial boot and hotplug time.  The
    info in these SSDT tables is used by the SN kernel IO "fixup" code (which is
    called at boot and hotplug time).
    
    On hotplugs (i.e.  enable_slot()), if running with an ACPI capable prom,
    attempt to obtain a new ACPI SSDT table for the slot being hotplugged.  If
    successful, add the table to the ACPI namespace (acpi_load_table()) and then
    walk the new devices and add them to the ACPI infrastructure (acpi_bus_add()).
    
    On hot unplugs (i.e.  disable_slot()), if running with an ACPI capable prom,
    attempt to remove the SSDT table associated with the slot from the ACPI
    namespace (acpi_unload_table_id()) and infastructure (acpi_bus_trim()).
    
    From: John Keller <jpk@sgi.com>
    
     A bug was fixed where the sgi hotplug driver was removing
     the slot's SSDT table from the ACPI namespace a bit too early in
     disable_slot(). Also, we now call acpi_bus_start() subsequent
     to acpi_bus_add().

    Altix: ACPI SSDT PCI device support
    
    Add SN platform support for running with an ACPI
    capable PROM that defines PCI devices in SSDT
    tables. There is a SSDT table for every occupied
    slot on a root bus, containing info for every
    PPB and/or device on the bus. The SSDTs will be
    dynamically loaded/unloaded at hotplug enable/disable.
    
    Platform specific information that is currently
    passed via a SAL call, will now be passed via the
    Vendor resource in the ACPI Device object(s) defined
    in each SSDT.

    ACPI 3.0 incorporated the SRAT spec, upping the table version to 2,
    and extending the size of the proximity domain from 1-byte to 4-bytes.
    This extension was into a reserved field that firmware should
    set to 0, but the HP simulator had non-zero values there
    resulting in unexpected huge numbers.
    
    So mask the domain down to 8-bits for now.
    A more general fix will be to check the table version
    supplied by firmware and get paranoid about reserved fields.

    ACPICA: Re-implement interpreters' "serialized mode"
    
    Enhanced the implementation of the interpreters'
    serialized mode (boot with "acpi_serialize" to set
    acpi_glb_all_methods_serialized flag.)
    When this mode is specified, instead of creating a serialization
    semaphore per control method, the interpreter lock is
    simply no longer released before a blocking operation
    during control method execution. This effectively makes
    the AML Interpreter single-threaded. The overhead of a
    semaphore per-method is eliminated.

    multiple OS threads could acquire the global lock

    asus-laptop: add bluetooth and wlan support
    
    WLED and BLED are not handled like other leds (MLED, etc ..),

    If the method for wireless_status is found, it's used to get the

    method, which tell if the bluetooth/wlan device is present or not.
    This patch show why we need a ASUS_SET_DEVICE_ATTR macro : if
    there is a bluetooth device, /sys/dev.../asus-laptop/bluetooth
    is usable, else it's not but it's clean.

    ACPI: remove motherboard driver (redundant with PNP system driver)
    
    The PNP system board driver (drivers/pnp/system.c) contains all the
    same functionality, so we don't need the ACPI version.
    
    Previously, a motherboard device would be claimed by *both* the ACPI and
    PNP drivers, resulting in stuff like this in /proc/ioports:
    
        1200-121f : motherboard	<-- from drivers/acpi/motherboard.c
          1200-121f : pnp 00:0d	<-- from drivers/pnp/system.c
    
    Make sure to enable CONFIG_PNP (and CONFIG_PNPACPI) to include the
    PNP system board driver.

    i386: turn on CONFIG_PNP in defconfig
    
    I'm trying to remove drivers/acpi/motherboard.c, which is mostly
    redundant with drivers/pnp/system.c.  So make sure that we include the

    Turning on CONFIG_PNP also causes the following options to be enabled:
    
        CONFIG_PNPACPI
        CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_PNP
    
    CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_PNP causes legacy serial ports to be discovered

    ACPI: move FADT resource reservations from motherboard driver to osl
    
    Resources described by the FADT aren't really a good fit for the
    ACPI motherboard driver.
    
    The motherboard driver cares about PNP0C01 and PNP0C02 devices and
    their resources.
    
    The FADT describes some resources used by the ACPI core.  Often, they
    are also described by by the _CRS of a motherboard device, but I think
    it's better to reserve them specifically in the ACPI osl.c because
    (a) the motherboard driver is optional and ACPI uses the resources even
    if the driver is absent, and (b) I want to remove the ACPI motherboard
    driver because it's mostly redundant with the PNP system.c driver.

    ACPI: fix Supermicro X7DB8+ Boot regression
    
    
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7695
    
    Originally we converted bind/unbind to use a new pci bridge driver.
    The driver will add/remove _PRT, so we can eventually remove
    .bind/.unbind methods.
    
    But we found that some of the _ADR-Based devices don't have _PRT,
    i.e. they are not managed by the new ACPI PCI bridge driver.
    So that .bind method is not called for some _ADR-Based devices,
    which leads to a failure.
    
    Now we make ACPI PCI Root Bridge Driver scan and binds all _ADR-Based devices
    once the driver is loaded, in the .add method of ACPI PCI Root Bridge driver.
    
    Extra code path for calling .bind/.unbind when _ADR-Based devices
    are hot added/removed is also added.

    ACPI: use PNPID:instance_no as bus_id of ACPI device
    
    Previously we used the device name in the DSDT, but would
    crash upon encountering a duplicate. Also, exposing the
    DSDT device name to the user in a patch isn't a good idea,
    because it is arbitrary.
    
    After some discussion, we finally decided to use
    "PNPID:instance_no" as the bus_id of ACPI devices.
    
    Two attributes for each device are added at the same time,
    the full pathname in ACPI namespace and hardware_id if it has.
    
    NOTE:	acpi_bus_id_list is used to keep the information of PNPID
    	and instance number of the given PNPID. Loop the
    	acpi_bus_id_list to find the instance_no of the	same PNPID
    	when register a device. If failed, i.e. we don't have a
    	node with this PNPID, allocate one and link it to this list.
    
    NOTE:	Now I don't take the memory free work in charge.
    	If necessary, I can add a reference count in
    	struct acpi_device_bus_id, and check the reference and
    	when unregister a device, i.e. memory is freed when
    	the reference count of a given PNPID is 0.

    ACPI: add acpi_bus_removal_type in acpi_device
    
    Add removal_type in structure acpi_device for hot removal.
    
    ACPI_BUS_REMOVAL_EJECT is used for ACPI device hot removal.
    Only one parameter is allowed in .remove method due to driver model.
    So removal_type is added to indicate different removal type.

    ACPI: add acpi_bus_ops in acpi_device
    
    Add acpi_bus_ops in acpi_device to support acpi hot plug.
    
    NOTE:	Two methods .add and .start in acpi_driver.ops are
    	called separately to probe ACPI devices, while only
    	.probe method is called in driver model.
    	As executing .add and .start separately is critical
    	for ACPI device hot plug, we use acpi_bus_ops to
    	distinguish different code path.

    ACPI: convert to sysfs framework
    
    Setup new sysfs framework
    
    1.	Remove /sys/firmware/acpi
    2.	Add ACPI device in device tree.
    
    File "eject" for every device that has _EJ0 method is moved from
    /sys/firmware to /sys/devices.
    Operation on this file is exactly the same as before.
    i.e. echo 1 to "eject" will cause hot removal of this device.
    Corresponding changes should be made in userspace for hot removal.

    ACPI: add ACPI bus_type for driver model
    
    Add ACPI bus_type for Linux driver model.
    
    1.	.shutdown method is added into acpi_driver.ops
    	needed by bus_type operations.
    2.	remove useless parameter 'int state' in .resume method.
    3.	change parameter 'int state'
    	to 'pm_message_t state' in .suspend method.
    
    Note:	The new .uevent method mark ACPI drivers by PNPID instead of by name.
    	Udev script needs to look for "HWID=" or "COMPTID=" to load
    	ACPI drivers as a result.
