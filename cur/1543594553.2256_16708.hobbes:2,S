no, but it's not necessarily a useful number anyhow -- because it's
possible that the remote end ACKd bytes but the ACK never arrives.  so you
can get into a situation where the remote application has the entire
message but the local application doesn't know.  the only way to solve
this is above the TCP layer.  (message duplicate elimination using an
unique id.)
if the #bytes ack'd was available it would probably fool people into
implementing buggy code (which of course they do anyhow :)
