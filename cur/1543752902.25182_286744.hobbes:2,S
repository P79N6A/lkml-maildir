Hi,
your scenario is a bit different, it looks like the controller does not want
to response right from the beginning (while on Roey's box kernel detects both
keyboard and mouse just fine):

Could you try booting with acpi=off and without PNP compiled in? And maybe
with pci=routeirq
Also, there is a patch my Alan Cox dealing with legacy emulation (but note
that first part (udelay(50)) has already been applied:
