It wasn't just MIPS.  IBM has a very popular blade system that has huge
issues with this, and I think there are some other IBM systems based on
the same BIOS that also do bad things if we don't grab the USB
controller away from the BIOS as soon as possible (nasty interrupt and
other messes happen...)
