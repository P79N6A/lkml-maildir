The example you gave me wasn't valid C.. Well, from what I can tell it
wasn't valid C, because the "for" statement had an opening "(", but no
visible closing ")" .. And the "{" looked like it was in the wrong
spot.  If you want me to have something to benchmark against, I have to
first be able to test and use your code, and if I can't use your code
it's pointless to try to make it quicker.  
If you could provide (preferrably via web download or ftp) sample source
that uses that function, it would speed up my ability to benchmark,
thereafter I could submit improved code.
