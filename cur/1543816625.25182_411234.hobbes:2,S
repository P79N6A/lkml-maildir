Sorry, but I'm not able to give you more information.  I tried again
several times with PATA and never saw the oops again, so I don't think
trying libata would help since not seeing an oops wouldn't mean
anything at all.  Unless there is a _specific_ way to trigger this bug
("cause much disk IO" isn't enough because it only led to an oops once
out of maybe something like 30-40 tries) I cannot do anything.
