A lot of NVIDIA-chipset motherboards have BIOS problems where they 
include an incorrect ACPI interrupt override for the timer interrupt, 
which tends to cause the system to fail to boot due to the timer 
interrupt not working. The kernel normally ignores ACPI interrupt 
overrides on the timer interrupt for NVIDIA chipsets for this reason. 
Unfortunately on some such boards the override is actually correct and 
needed, and so this actually causes problems. Hence the 
acpi_use_timer_override option.
In any case this is unlikely to have anything to do with your problem, 
since if that was messed up you likely would never have even booted.
