Your point is well taken.
I will probably end of with a system daemon (User Space), but pass
communication via a Kernel module (Kernel Space).  The application can
call the kernel module, passing data back to the daemon (User Space).
Once I have hw, I may just use the kernel module.
Thanks again.

Since you plan to use this for a PCI device eventually, it sounds like
UIO would be of help.

Perhaps you can backport UIO or can get someone to do it for you.
