Why not use 'last' --> 'awk' --> 'sort' then use a script at
that point to add up the values. This way your not dealing
with wtmp at all.

Subject: slightly off-topic trivia probe
First off, please forgive the cross-posting and the irrelevance
of the topic. I'm not sure there is an appropriate mailing
list for this particular question...
I'm trying to develop a quick and dirty login accounting
utility which scans wtmp for information (I know, it's not
the most reliable or complete, etc...), and can't seem
to find any information on the significance of the tv_usec
field in struct utmp.ut_tv. It seens to have values in
it quite often, but they don't make much sense as durations
or any of my other "guesses"...
This is a RedHat 6.0 based system, but I suspect wtmp is
fairly standard across distributions...
