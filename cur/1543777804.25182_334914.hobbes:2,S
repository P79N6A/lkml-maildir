I want to add one more thing, you can compile your own kernel with KDB
patch applied .... if u really want to use KDB on Redhat ...... And I
think you can also try to apply patch of KDB for 2.4.20 on the Redhat
kenel, that might succeed if redhat havn't changed anything in the
files of 2.4.20 kernel in which KDB patches or make changes .........
