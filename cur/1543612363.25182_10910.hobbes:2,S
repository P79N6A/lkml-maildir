So has anyone had time to test the Python version 1.5 based CML2 that
was posted?  Would that make it more acceptable?

This is a bogus arguement, since I could say the same about installing
new kernels.  There could (and will) be security problems with the
kernel, so we should not release new ones until we have proved they
are correct.
Yeah, I'm being a pain here, but Rik is making a bad arguement here.
Rik> Yes, I agree the method you're using to smuggle CML2 into a

I think you're being too harsh here.  Smuggling is not happening here,
it's been very aboveboard that CML2 might (I repeat MIGHT) be
back-ported to the 2.4 series of kernels.  But since it would happen
in the -pre tree, there would be plenty of notice.  And people could
complain then.
The requirement for python2 is a bit of a pain, but hey, for 2.5, it's
not a problem.
