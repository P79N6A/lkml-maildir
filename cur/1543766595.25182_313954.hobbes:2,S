I'm not the sched_domains guru that Nick is, but as your question has gone
unanswered for a few days I'll chime in and see if I can't help you provoke
a more definitive response.
Your assumptions above are correct to the best of my knowledge.  The only
pain it causes is that the scheduler will not be able to "see" outside of
the span of the highest sched_domain attached to a particular CPU.
        A          B
       / \        / \
      X   Y      Z   W
     /\   /\    /\   /\
    0  1 2  3  4  5 6  7
In this setup, with your "Alpha" & "Beta" domains splitting the system in
half, a process in a cpuset spanning cpus 0..7 will get "stuck" in
whichever domain it happens to be in when the Alpha & Beta domains get
created.  Explicit sys_sched_setaffinity() calls will still move it between
domains, but it will not move between Alpha & Beta on its own.
Loadbalancing from CPU 0's perspective (in Alpha) sees only CPUs 0..3.
Right Nick? ;)
