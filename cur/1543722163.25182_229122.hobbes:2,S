But Martin has a point here.
How to figure out for example the number of arguments to remap_page_range.
One could do some grepping in the mm.h file, or one could try to compile
a minimal module calling this function.
If we go for the simple version by grepping we need to figure out where
to find the source. In the past this was simple - just follow the
build symlink. But now kernels may be shipped with separate source
and output directory exposing the weakness of this method.
A much more reliable way is to build a simple module.
If the module build succeeds that specific version
of remap_page_range is OK.
nvidia does something similar, but they take the false assumption
that the running kernel is always the one being build for.
So they call gcc direct.
Other modules uses the grep method - which will fail when the kernel
is build with separate output and source directories.

SUBDIRS were kept for backward compatibility - and I realise it will stay
for a long time. The implementation were kept straightforward so no problem.
