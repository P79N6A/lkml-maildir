Sure there is some clean up needed -- on the arch side.
Even !PCI dma_xxx wrappers that do nothing more than return a dma
mapping error are a valid platform implementation.
Even !HAS_DMA (s/390?) arches should be using the aforementioned
return-error wrappers, mimicing the implementation of PCI functions
in linux/pci.h for the !PCI case.
libata core for DMA mapping is already generic enough such that, #ifdefs
are not needed in the code.
OTOH.....  further work in libata _is_ need for I/O accessors, to
isolate those from the core code.
