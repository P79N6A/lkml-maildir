Ok, having looked more at this, I have to say that the whole 
"IRQ_DELAYED_DISABLE" thing seems very fragile indeed.
It looks like we should do it not only for APIC edge-triggered interrupts, 
but for HT and MSI interrupts too, as far as I can tell (at least they 
also use the "handle_edge_irq" routine)
So I'm wondering how many other cases there are that are missing this.
In that sense, Ingo's patch was a lot safer, although I still dislike it 
for all the other reasons I mentioned - it's simply wrong to re-send a 
level-triggered irq.
I don't know MSI and HT interrupts well enough to tell whether they will 
re-trigger on their own when we unmask them, but the point is, this 
_looks_ like it might be incomplete.
I think part of the problem is a bad interface. We should simply never set 
the IRQ handler on its own. It should be a field in the "irq_chip" 
structure, and we should use _different_ irq chip structures for level and 
edge-triggered. Then we should also add the "flags" thing there, and you 
could do something like
	static struct irq_chip level_ioapic_chip = {
		..
instead of making the insane decision to use the "same" chip for all 
ioapic things.
Ingo? Eric? Comments?
