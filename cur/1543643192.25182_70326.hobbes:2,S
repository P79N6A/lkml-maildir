No, there is not a problem in preempt... what this change does is BUG()
out if schedule() is called while being in any way non-atomic.
While this sounds like a great debugging check, it is not useful in
general since we surely have some bad code that calls schedule() with
locks held.  Further, since the atomic accounting only includes locks if
CONFIG_PREEMPT is set, you only see this with kernel preemption enabled.
Linus, please back this out... attached patch is against current BK.
Yeah, I know we can change the BUG() to a show_stack() ... but I still
think it will be too much and just deter people from using kernel
preemption which is the opposite of what I want.
