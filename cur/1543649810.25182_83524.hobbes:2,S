I think so, at least Andrew is championing us in that direction.  But I
agree.
It somewhere became the notion if the function is small, it
automatically should be inlined.  I suspect Andrew has even stricter
criteria than me (I think super small functions should be inlined) but
the general "its only a couple of lines" or "it could be a macro" are
not sufficient criterion for inlining.
So, my thoughts on suitable criteria would be:
	- used only once and only ever in that one spot (i.e.
	  it really could be part of the caller, but it was pulled
	  out for cleanliness.  Keep it inline to not have the
	  cleanliness cause a performance degradation (however
	  small)).
	- small functions, where small is so small the function
	  overhead is nearly the same size.  Stuff that might not
	  even do anything but return a permutation of an argument,
	  etc.
	- very very time critical functions in time critical places
So that removes the previous criteria of "the function is N lines or
smaller" where N is some number less than 100 :)
