I agree with Bart, it's usually never that clear. Quit harping the
stupid LG issue, they did something brain dead in the firmware and I
almost have to say that they got what they deserved for doing something
as _stupid_ as that.
Jeff, it's wonderful to think that you can always rely on checking spec
bits, but in reality it never really 'just works out' for any given set
of hardware.
