Ah, I misunderstood your comment, sorry.
The regions used by ACPI are registered as 'nosave' by the arch code and
we don't save them.  However, the ACPI NVS area is exceptional in that we
are supposed to save and restore it.  The problem is to restore it at the right
time and it's quite hard to figure out from the spec what time is the right
one (the only thing it says is we should do that before calling _WAK).
Thanks,
