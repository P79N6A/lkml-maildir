Jes, that's your ifdef-magic around around qla1280_remove_one.. Do you
remember why you added it?  The only case we don't need it is when
the driver is builtin and CONFIG_HOTPLUG is not set - and in that case
__devexit should get rid of it for us.

The patch looks good to me.  In fact that's how it was in the patch
I sent to Jes..
