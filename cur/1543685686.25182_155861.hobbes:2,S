In that case, the next time one could complain similarly, "instead of
giving the CPU time used, you should give the CPU percentage". Probably
that's the reason usually both is given, CPU time used in user and system
space as well.

The CPU percentages were given as integers in Grant's original numbers and
in same cases as 0. Doing mindless math with those would have given (even
more) bogus and misleading results.

I just can't believe reiser4 is so fast on an unloaded system (from the
numbers one could also expect it's the slowest on loaded systems and JFS
seems to be the winner on those). Disks have a speed/seek limits. To be
faster, one must ignore 'sync', do less IO (file/tail packing, compression,
etc) and/or optimise seek times.

Yes, but I would collect those stats after these short term tests for an
additional X seconds to make sure no additional "optimization" is involved
(aka data is indeed on the disk).
