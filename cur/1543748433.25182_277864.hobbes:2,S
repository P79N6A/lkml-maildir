They should not get delayed by them any more than in the PREEMPT_DESKTOP
configuration (other than the threading overhead which we've separately
said should be modest). They should be delayed by them less since we CAN
migrate the RT task away from the IRQ task (at least until I get the case
where multiple concurrent IRQ or /# threads keep both CPU's busy).

For the most part, that I/O workload IS because I have the RT application
running. That was one of my points. I cannot reliably starve any of
those activities. The disk reads in my real application simulate a disk
read from a real world device. That data is needed for RT processing
in the simulated system. Some of the network traffic is also RT since
we generate a data stream that is interpreted in real time by other
systems.

For the test at my desktop I CAN do that but CHOOSE to not do that
since the real application has to handle the additional overhead.
Again, the set up I have is more of an apples to apples comparison.

I said previously the primary time source is from the shared memory
interface on the PCI bus for the specific application I described.
I could make that higher priority than the rest.
Actually we do use network messages to synchronize with a system that
is not in the cluster. At 20 Hz, we send a network message that
basically means "start execution" to that other system. It cannot
be delayed much either.

As I stated before (and I think you agree) the overhead of the setup
I have now for PREEMPT_RT should be comparable to that for PREEMPT_DESKTOP.
Neither should have a great advantage / disadvantage over the other.
The overhead for threading is certainly present in _RT but should
be offset to some extent by the improved migration opportunities.
The measurements however, do not seem to confirm that assessment.
Either the measurements are broke or the system is and in either case
should be fixed.
