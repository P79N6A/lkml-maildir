This is a caricature. What has happened a few times was something along the
lines:
LT: <construction> doesn't work. It used to work with 2.7.2
ET: Yes, sorry. That was a bug in 2.7.2, the code is broken.
LT: Reenable!
ET: You'll have to rewrite, sorry. This is _not_ a compiler just for the
    Linux kernel
It just so happens that the kernel is _the_ code that most streches the
compiler, AFAIK. Breakage due to ill-understood features, usage of outright
compiler bugs and reliance on optimizations done a certain way (or not
done) does happen.
Look at it from another perspective: There are lots of features for which
Linux enthusiasts are clamoring, and Linus (and the other head hackers
agree!) just doesn't allow them into the kernel. Quite rightly so, the
overwhelming mayority of the time. The egcs team is doing exactly the same,
to them the kernel is just _one_ more client among many thousands. An
important one, but in no way in a position to dictate egcs policy. And that
is also fine with me.
You'll have to live with that.

There have been replacements. Sometimes painful. OTOH, nobody is forcing
you to use gcc-2.95, are they?

Fine. Let others do the grunt work (Alan Cox was instrumental in getting
linux to compile with egcs; I did my bit too, there were/are many others)
