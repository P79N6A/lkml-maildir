Well, this was on an x86 machine with 8 cores but relatively poor
scalability and horrific memory latencies ... i.e. it tends to
exaggerate the effects of bad locks compared to what I would see on a
more scalable POWER machine.  We actually ran SFS on a 4-way POWER-5
machine with the patch and didn't see any real change in throughput,
and fragmentation was a little better.  I can go dig out the data if
someone is really interested.
In your case with 62 dentry objects per page (which is only going to
get much worse as we bump up base page sizes), I think the chances of
success of this approach or anything similar are horrible because we
aren't really solving any of the fundamental issues.
For me, the patch we mostly an experiment to see if the "blunderbus"
effect (to quote mjb) could be controlled any better that we do
today.  Mostly, it didn't seem worth it to me -- especially since we
wanted the global dcache lock to go away.

Yep, and that's more or less how I "simulated" SFS, just had tons of
small files.  I wasn't trying to really simulate the networking part
or op mixture etc -- just the slab fragmentation as a "worst-case".

Yes, but on systems with smaller pages it does seem to have some
positive effect.  I don't really know how well this has been
quantified.

That is unfortunate, but interesting because I didn't know if this was
not a "real-problem" as some have contended.  I know SPEC SFS is a
somewhat questionable workload (really, what isn't though?), so the
evidence gathered from that didn't seem to convince many people.  
What kind of (real) workload are you seeing this on?
Thanks,
Sonny
