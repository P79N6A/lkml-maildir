I think that would be up to the installer.

I would say that they have a priority, just that the priority isn't being
used.

I don't think these are all using "shared IRQ...". I was my understanding that
each IRQ had its own chain. And the priority of the drivers in that chain
is determined by the order.

That depends entirely on the chain. If there is one or more high speed devices
such that walking the chain is faster that responding to an interrupt, then it
is DEFINITELY worth it to walk the chain.

No necessarily specialized applications - just ones that should/must not
loose data due to starvation. Consider the problems caused by relatively
slow devices such as a mouse. Resyncronization is a real problem, which is
one of the reasons to give it a nonshared IRQ. The same could be said of
a PPP connection over a serial line...
If they did share an interrupt, you make the PPP serial line higher priority
than the mouse... Yet you still don't want to loose mouse syncronization - so
check it anyway. Handling it is still faster than an additional interrupt,
and with less overhead.
Granted, this is more important on slower hardware or basic interactive 
service, but it all contributes to overhead. Properly organized (and used)
chains will reduce the overhead.
