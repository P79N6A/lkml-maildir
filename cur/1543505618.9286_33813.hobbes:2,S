No.
readl() is for things that want to look like PCI (ie subsets of PCI like
ISA and ISA PnP, or "look-alikes" of PCI like MCA). 
Do "xxx_readl()" for other buses if you need to - there's no way in hell I
want to see some architectures have 
	inline unsigned int readl(unsigned int address)
	{
		if (address < xxx)
			return pci_readl(address);
		if (address < yyy)
			return vme_readl(address);
		if (address < zzz)
			return zorro_readl(address);
	}
I think we'll just define "readl()" to to be little-endian, and then that
problem is gone. That takes care of 99% of the market right now, so it
makes sense to just call it readl() - and let the 1% then have to type
four extra characters for "vme_readl()" etc.
