That's an interesting idea.  Some thoughts I'd have off the bat:
- I don't think there's a software modem implementation (free or
   otherwise) for linux that can support the server side of a digital
   (v.90, v.92) connection, but that would be excellent to have
- Americans might have an FCC concern due to power output restrictions on
   digital modem protocols, and also other voice applications
- Presumably it would only make sense to do this with voice connections
- Could this idea be extended to analog telephony devices?
