Well all we have in the changelog is
  Implement support for the E-Ink Metronome controller.  It provides an
  mmapable interface to the controller using defio support.  It was tested
  with a gumstix pxa255 with Vizplex media using Xfbdev and various X
  clients such as xeyes, xpdf, xloadimage.
grump.  This say nothing at all about the change to drivers/video/fb_defio.c.
a) the changelog _should_ document this change.  Please send a paragraph and
   I'll add it.
b) If this discussion hadn't happened, that bug (whatever it is) would
   have remained unfixed in 2.6.25.  As a direct consequence of poor
   changelogging.
c) This bugfix (whatever it is) should have been in a separate patch.
Thanks.
