Well, CD rippers do much more than just read the audio data, they also
put the chunks of it together (there is no good synchronization in the
audio stream), check for errors, re-read blocks, correct the errors and
much more. It's no fun to read that data. You'd need quite some code to
do that in kernel, not just a couple simple functions.
