Subject: K7 on SD11 and 2.2.17: memory not detected

I am running 2.2.17 + reiserfs patches on Athlon-700 on FIC-SD11 with 384MB
of RAM.
The weird thing is Linux only sees 64MB of RAM! The BIOS sees 384MB of RAM.
I am working around this by saying "mem=384M" on the cmdline.
Additional h/w include: 3 Quantum 15GB disks, 52x IDE CDROM, Dlink
Quad-ethernet.
The additional kernel options that are perhaps relevant are:
MTRR = yes
USE DMA = yes
Support for VIA68xx chipset = yes
Is this a known issue and if so, what is the correct fix?
I'd appreciate if anyone has some insight into the problem.
Much thanks.
