| As I am so fond of saying, it's almost always correct to indicate what
| kernel version one if referring to in a problem report.
| 
| Please decode the oops output and post it here.
I can't reproduce this problem on Linux 2.5.68.
However, I did initialize dptr before using it.  Did you?
You see, I can't tell if you did or not because you didn't post
a complete sample to reproduce the problem.
