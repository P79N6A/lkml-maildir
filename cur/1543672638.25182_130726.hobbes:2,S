I was starting to think noone was ever going to help out.  :)
If you don't mind, I'll start merging your changes into the CVS tree
on SourceForge. I assume this is all GPL code, since you started from
my original patches... I'll wait to hear back from you before merging
it in, since it's a pretty big change.

These were features I was trying to put off until someone else was
a little more active, I have to admit. I've been working on the code
in between other projects, but I'm a terrible release engineer and
other stuff got more interesting. It's good to see that someone else
cares about it.
