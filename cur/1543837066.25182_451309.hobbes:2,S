I have updated the driver with all other review comments except comment
on formula above by Jean. I can some part of description from Tony's
explanation along with removing the following code line
/* Set Own Address */
omap_i2c_write_reg(dev, OMAP_I2C_OA_REG, dev->own_address);
 
As it is not needed. Please confirm so that I can send the revised
patch  soon.
