Nearly same over here. We have a linux router (eight fastether-interfaces)
which had the nearly same effect two times. But there was no lockup, just one
message about the overflow.
Simple routing (every eth own /24 subnet), one or two special routes.
When having this warning message, the route cache had about 25 entries and
the ARP cache about 80.
Kernel was 2.2.12, too.

Same over here.
.config excerpt:
CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER=y
CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES=y
CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG=y
CONFIG_IP_ROUTER=y
CONFIG_SKB_LARGE=y
> SMP=yes
UP here.
I can provide detailed info on the box if needed.
Best regards,
Daniel
