Isn't that because there's a perferct documentation for programming ALSA but 
authors of those apps can't read?

I am with Linux since 1997, I know bunch of them. I used to use XEmacs, but 
now I prefer VIM. But I am not a .asoundrc programmer, I want to be just a 
user.

It's good that people are not thinking that ALSA is already perfect, it leaves
