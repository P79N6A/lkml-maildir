I have successfully compiled and used 2.4.0 on pentium 133
system.  However because I wanted to try reiserfs I installed
2.4.1-pre10.  ppp is now broken.  I get the following error
-------------
Jan 23 21:24:55 a pppd[505]: Serial connection established.
Jan 23 21:24:55 a pppd[505]: ioctl(PPPIOCGFLAGS): Invalid argument
Jan 23 21:24:56 a pppd[505]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Jan 23 21:24:56 a pppd[505]: Exit.

I hope it's not my fault?  I did not have any problem with
2.4.0 kernel.
---------------
Next I also have a dell box running celeron 566 with intel i810. 
I run 2.2.18 and managed to make my display adapter work
with a couple of packages from intel site.  I would like
to run 2.4.  First 2.4.0 compiles and boots on this
machine fine.  But I could not startx.  I gave up at that
point but I wanted reiserfs so I again tried with pre10.  pre10
kernel won't even boot.  It says that I must supply "root="
parameter
That can't be right.  First I compile and install on the
same machine.  Next my root is /dev/hda1.  
Next I did 
/usr/sbin/rdev bzImage /dev/hda1
That did not work.
Next I install lilo with proper root parameter.
That did not work.
I hope someone can find and fix these problems.
Regards
