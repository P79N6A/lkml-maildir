So what the heck do you do when something modifies mmaped page when you
get the change of on-disk one? Say it, writer is notified that write had
been completed, sends packet to you and you flip a bit on a page that
happens to be mmaped on the place where write had happened.
Write-through-pagecache is OK, but write straight to disk bypassing the
cache? Welcome to the fun with aliases...
