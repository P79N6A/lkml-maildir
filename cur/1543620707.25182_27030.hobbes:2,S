I just compiled my kernel with TUN=m support. I don't think I need
vtund.

That was it - thanks! FYI - I upgraded my kernel-headers from 2.4.2-2 to
2.4.9-21 and recompiled pengaol and other software, which was using
TUN/TAP.
But it's pretty weird, though. Did they change values of #defines for
TUN/TAP ioctls' numbers, or what? If so, that's quite bad in my opinion
(what if somebody had binary-only version of his client?).
Anyway, once again thanks very much, Joe. This just proved that even
using crappy winmodem and the crappiest, most Windozed ISP ever (AOL) one
can succesfully rock with Linux ;-)
