Hi,
Here's what i've found today in logs:
Feb 13 02:10:41 main kernel: __alloc_pages: 1-order allocation failed. 
Feb 13 02:10:42 main last message repeated 143 times
Feb 13 02:10:47 main kernel: ed. 
Feb 13 02:10:47 main kernel: __alloc_pages: 1-order allocation failed. 
Feb 13 02:50:30 main syslogd 1.3-3: restart (remote reception).
After that there was possibly lock-up or reboot (i don't know, when i 
connected to  the machine it was already running).
What can be possible cause of such things ?
I am running 2.4.1-XFS (2001/02/10) on a Mendocino
366/128MB/VT82C596A/PDC20262.
Regards,
- Krzysztof
