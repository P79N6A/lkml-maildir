Because the temperature interface was there first and is part of the
existing kernel to user space API. Now that the device is abstracted I
agree entirely that it should also appear in hwmon and the support
library code can be extended to do this along with multiple watchdogs.

As and when watchdogs are all platform devices we probably should. Right
now most of them are not and we don't really have a proper 'isa_device'
object yet. I see that as a migration path or an 'aspiration', but having
it in one place will make that easier to achieve after we have the common
API.
Likewise sysfs, classes and multiple watchdogs all want addressing but
that gets a lot easier once everything is using a common framework and a
passed 'struct watchdog' to make multiple instances just work.
