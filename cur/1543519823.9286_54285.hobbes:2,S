   I'm still seeing the problem in 2.2.14pre15 although it may have moved. Now I
   get:
   Dec 18 12:45:34 perfect kernel: hdc: buffer list corrupted (0, -2, 2) 
   Dec 18 12:45:34 perfect kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:01 (hdc),
   sector 1672808
   Do you have a patch to try?
Alan, I think Mark is right, what if:
	do {
		unsigned long flags;
		unsigned long nsect = rq->current_nr_sectors;
		if (nsect > mcount)
			nsect = mcount;
		mcount -= nsect;
		idedisk_output_data(drive, rq->buffer, nsect<<7);
IRQ right after the output to the disk, and reread current_nr_sectors,
output data to the disk again, etc.
The second call will decrement nr_sectors in the rq, we return from
the IRQ and the toplevel call does it again, resulting in the
corrupted request.
Later,
