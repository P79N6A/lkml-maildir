What userspace interface do your drivers have? I don't think that there
is anything generic available at the moment, other than COMEDI (which is
rather outdated as far as I know).

I'd like drivers/daq better, because it doesn't have anything to do with
the bus it is connected to; a chipselect bus connectable ADC may be
connected to a SoC CS-bus or to a PCI bridge and you want to use the
same driver for it.
