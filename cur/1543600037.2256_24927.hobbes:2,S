Well, I tend to think the "if true" case as the fast path, and nobody
should use SA_INTERRUPT so... ;)

Agreed, but the SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM flag should die as well as the
SA_INTERRUPT flag: we should call add_interrupt_randomness in the irq
handler, this will improve performance and it will solve such bug as
well.

I don't like to do such work in the highlevel code, it's just a waste of
cpu cycles.

Theoretically it could be still valid but again if we want to change
such part of the irq handler API I'd prefer if the irq handler will be
required to do the softirq check itself before returning if it did
anything that could raise a softirq (this will avoid checks on the
return value and a branch in the irq highlevel code).
Also it would be a dubious optimization to add yet another branch to the
highlevel code to choose if to do such a light check (ok, the irq
handler retval check would always execute in CPU core but the pending
softirq cacheline is quite hot anyways usually).
So I think the comment will never apply to the code.
