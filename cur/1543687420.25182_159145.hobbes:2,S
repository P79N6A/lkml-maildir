I'm doing a backup now, basically a "cp -a" of all relevant directories
on the system, and smoothness _has_ taken a penalty by the starvation
work. Scrolling a picturefilled webpage (eg cnn.com) in Opera 6.12 jerks
with each disk write, or thereabouts. Load is ca 2.5 to 3. Doing a "dd"
from /dev/zero to a large file doesn't affect anything since it's a long
steady write.
Ah well :-)
