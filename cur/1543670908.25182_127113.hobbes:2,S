Maybe, but the version prior to 2.4.21-pre7 worked pretty good 
for me.

I entirely agree.
However, the patch we are discussing has only *6 days*. If you had
submitted it 2 months ago, there wouldn't be such problems.
[BTW: searching back the l-k archives doesn't find any occurances of
your patch. I guess you sended it directly to Marcelo...]

Sure, you should continue development and submit a fresh new version
ready to be tested in 2.4.22-pre1/pre2. 
As for 2.4.21, well, we want something pretty well tested. Will this
be the case with your new mega-patch ? I don't think so. The safest
is to go back to a version which worked. At least the bugs of that
version are known, which is not the case for the new version.
Stelian.
