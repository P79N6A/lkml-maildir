Hey,
I'm having some trouble getting pcmcia serial support working with 2.5.42.
Firstly, it seems serial_cs.o is no longer present, except in the 
documentation.  I'm assuming that what I now need is 8250_cs.o
When I `modprobe 8250_cs`, nothing shows up in dmesg
If i then remove and insert the card, I get
---
devfs_register(tts/1): could not append to parent, err: -17
tts/%d1 at I/O 0x2f8 ( irq = 5 ) is a 16550A
Trying to free nonexistent resource <000002f8-000002ff>
---
and I still can't access the serial port.
.config is attatched
can anyone give some clues ?
thanks,
	/ Brett Pemberton
