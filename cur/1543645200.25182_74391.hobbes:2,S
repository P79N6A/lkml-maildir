2.5.39                  103.72          72%             1.53
Things to note:
Despite the new deadline scheduler, performance under IO load is worse than
2.5.38-mm3 (something else?)
Asterisks are placed where the difference was statistically significant from 2.5.39
Hardware: 1133Mhz P3, 224Mb Ram, IDE ATA100 5400rpm drive, IO load on same drive
as compile.
*NOTE* New version of contest means results are not compatible with results of
0.3x. Process Load now more of a process load (and less of a cpu load), and
changed priming (memory flushing) prior to each test results in far greater
resolution of results - hence the notable change in even noload results.
