I completely understand that.  However, I think putting something  
into mainline that only works or solves the particular problem you  
have is a bad idea.  I'll provide patches for the changes I'd like to  
see.  However, I figured a little discussion on the subject before I  
went off an spent time on it was worth while.

Do you only get callback when a channel is available?  How do you  
decide to do to provide PIO to the client?
A client should only request multiple channel to handle multiple  
concurrent operations.

What do you expect to happen in a system in which the channels are  
over subscribed?
Do you expect the DMA device driver to handle scheduling of channels  
between multiple clients?
