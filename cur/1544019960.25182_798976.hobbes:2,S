It shoud apply clean to 2.6.28.x as well, but this bug will only
trigger when a user of the SSC peripheral tries to request a SSC which
is already requested or not added to the list at all. So in most cases
bad platform drivers setup, configuration error or bad code.
In kernel 2.6.29-rc3 there are three users:
1 sound/soc/atmel/sam9g20_wm8731.c        274 ssc = ssc_request(0);
2 sound/soc/atmel/playpaq_wm8510.c        399 ssc = ssc_request(0);
3 sound/spi/at73c213.c                    980 chip->ssc = ssc_request(board->ssc_id);
The two first are a bit suspicious since they hard code id 0.
My 0.02 € is to get it in for 2.6.29, but fine to leave out for earlier
kernels.
