Subject: [PATCH] ext2/3 bugfix 4/6: Fix ext3 htree rename bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/6/352

Fix ext3 htree rename bug.
This fixes an ext3 htree bug pointed out by Christopher Li; if 
adding the new name to the directory causes a split, this can cause
the directory entry containing the old name to move to another 
block, and then the removal of the old name will fail.
