Hello,
just in case there is still somebody interested:
the problem stays the same with upgrading the server to 2.4.19-pre4
Trond: can you please tell me in short, what the common case (or your guess) is
why I see this stale file handles on the client side. I am going to try and
find out myself what the problem with reiserfs is here, it gets a bit on my
nerves now. Do you suspect the fs to drop some inodes under the nfs-server?
Regards,
Stephan
