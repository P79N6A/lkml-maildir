Hi
    I would like to use sendfile & LFS enabled(included  
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64).
    I'm using glibc-2.2.5 & linux-2.4.x
    But my compiler is throughing an error saying that sendfile is not  
supported
    with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.
    I need to support both LFS & sendfile(64).
    Pls clarify me whether i can use sendfile(64) with LFS or not.

Thanks & Regards
