Yup. struct dst is sensitive to alignements, especially for benches.
In the real world, we need to make sure that next pointer start at a cache 
line bondary (or a litle bit after), so that RT cache lookups use one cache 
line per entry instead of two. This permits better behavior in DDOS attacks.
(check commit 1e19e02ca0c5e33ea73a25127dbe6c3b8fcaac4b for reference)
Are you using a 64 or a 32 bit kernel ?
