That's still a little problematical because some hardware people put
a CPLD between the LCD controller and the LCD panel itself which
may change the characteristics.
It's fairly common to have one LCD controller appear in many different
devices (because its part of the CPU) and have the same display, yet
need different timing.
For example, see sa1100fb.c:
static struct sa1100fb_mach_info lq039q2ds54_info __initdata = {
        .pixclock       = 171521,       .bpp            = 16,
        .xres           = 320,          .yres           = 240,
        .hsync_len      = 5,            .vsync_len      = 1,
        .left_margin    = 61,           .upper_margin   = 3,
        .right_margin   = 9,            .lower_margin   = 0,
        .sync           = FB_SYNC_HOR_HIGH_ACT | FB_SYNC_VERT_HIGH_ACT,
        .lccr0          = LCCR0_Color | LCCR0_Sngl | LCCR0_Act,
        .lccr3          = LCCR3_OutEnH | LCCR3_PixRsEdg | LCCR3_ACBsDiv(2),
};
static struct sa1100fb_mach_info h3600_info __initdata = {
        .pixclock       = 174757,       .bpp            = 16,
        .xres           = 320,          .yres           = 240,
        .hsync_len      = 3,            .vsync_len      = 3,
        .left_margin    = 12,           .upper_margin   = 10,
        .right_margin   = 17,           .lower_margin   = 1,
        .cmap_static    = 1,
        .lccr0          = LCCR0_Color | LCCR0_Sngl | LCCR0_Act,
        .lccr3          = LCCR3_OutEnH | LCCR3_PixRsEdg | LCCR3_ACBsDiv(2),
};
Both of these are the same LCD panel (type LQ039Q2DS54) yet there are
two different sets of timing information, including the polarity of
the line and field clocks (which are equivalent to hsync and vsync.)
Also note that such panels are generally fixed resolution, though there
are a few rare exceptions where changing the colour depth is permitted.
