Hi,
I experience a major delay (about 5 min on dual CPU 3GHz machine, RedHat 
AS v4) at system boot-up at the point of "Starting udev:". The references 
to it I was able to find say that it was fixed in udev releases years ago. 
Is anything known about this problem?
> uname -a
Linux <...> 2.6.11.7 #2 SMP Tue Apr 19 16:46:25 EDT 2005 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
>rpm -q udev
udev-039-10.8.EL4
Any help is greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Alex
