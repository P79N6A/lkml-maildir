I have exactly the same problem
This happens whenever i boot machine with reader on
or usbstick plugged in.
It happens with newer kernels as well.
It is little bit annoying to reset machine just because i forgot
to switch off the printer which has card reader equipped ;)
some goofing with printks suggests ACPI as a place whenre it freezes.
But i got no proof for that.
Any suggestions are welcome.
