No!
Older version of ESD always kept playing silence to your soundcard even
when there was no output. Newer versions do not do this (then can even
close the device after a timeout).
This constant silent music creates a lot of interupts which was causing
your (probably unbuffered) serial port to lose characters. It also could
be possible that your sound driver spends a lot of time with interupts
disabled.
