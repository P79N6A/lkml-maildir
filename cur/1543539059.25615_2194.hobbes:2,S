Subject: [PATCH] 16bit NLS wchar_t version for 2.4.0-test5-pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After work with Urban Widmark and Petr Vandrovec, this is 16bit NLS
patch for 2.4.0-test5-pre1.  I have test this patch in
vfat/msdos/joliet/ntfs with cp950. Urban Widmark has test this patch in
joliet/vfat/ntfs. Petr Vandrovec has test this patch in ncpfs/vfat. It
works well.
Compare to 16bit NLS of 2.2.17, this patch has follow differences:
	1. change struct nls_unicode, internal unicode type, to wchar_t,
declare as u16.
	2. when doing charset conversion, uni2char()/char2uni() will
return bytes of character or error code.
	3. add one boundlen parameter to char2uni().
	4. change makefile to obj-[y/m/n] style.
	4. some euc-jp fix.
This patch can be download from

Hopefully you can accept this patch.
