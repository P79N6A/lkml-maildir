* Creation of /dev device files.
* Creation of standardized sysfs files.
* Interrupt registration and handling.
* mmap for physical and logical memory.
* read, poll, and fasync for interrupt handling.
* a predefined, clean design that the hardware manufacturer can use.

Alright, but everybody has the choice. If the alternative is to have no
Linux drivers at all because it's too expensive, then somebody might
consider UIO. To have the big parts of the driver in userspace allows
them to remain stable across different kernel versions. Driver updates
can take place without changing the kernel. For some manufacturers 
these will be strong arguments in favor of UIO.
