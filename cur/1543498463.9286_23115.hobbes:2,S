	Perhaps.  I can much more easily equate the two using devfs than
/dev/sd??.  At the moment devfs is availible, is there a way to do what you
are suggesting?  For All filesystems, including root?  And also, what about
all the other devices on a system?  This isn't just about filesystems and
scsi disks, though those are some of my major concerns.

	Sounds interesting, is there somewhere I can get more information
on this?  What is the likelyhood that it will work with the root filesystem?
If it doesn't, what then?
