is this inheritance perpetual? It is normal for some tasks to be boosted 
momentarily, but if the condition remains even after jackd has exited, 
it's clearly an anomaly. (lets call it "RT priority leakage".) Priority 
leakage on SMP was fixed recently, but there could be other bugs 
remaining.
There's priority-leakage debugging code in the -RT kernel, which is 
activated if you enable CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT. This debugging code, if 
triggered, should produce 'BUG: comm/123 leaked RT prio 123 (123)?" type 
of messages. But ... due to a bug it would not print out anything but 
would lock up hard if it detects the condition (and if 
RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT is enabled). I have fixed this reporting bug in the 
-51-08 kernel.
