I've just released the 2.6.23-rc7-ext4-1; it's largely identical to
2.6.23-rc6-ext4-1 except that I've synchronized patches and patch names
with patches that Andrew had pulled into 2.6.23-rc7-mm1.
It's available in the standard place:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git 2.6.23-rc8-ext4-1
