Hello,
I don't now if I am the only one, but from 2.2.11 I had great mails
problems: I use sendmail from netscape to send my mail, but for those
kernels, It didn't manage it... and fetchmail don't fetch any mail (and
it should...).
I have an ASUS P2B-LS, and dmesg give for it (I included two more lines):
SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 17850000 [8715 MB] [8.7 GB]
  PCI latency timer (CFLT) is unreasonably low at 0.  Setting to 32 clocks.
eth0: Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 at 0xa800, 00:E0:18:90:14:C5, IRQ 10.
  Board assembly 668081-002, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
  General self-test: passed.
  Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
  Internal registers self-test: passed.
  ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x24c9f043).
  Receiver lock-up workaround activated.
Partition check:
I really don't understand what wrong with it: worked just fine till 2.2.10-ac12,
and I have compiled with same config file...
Just let me know if additionnal information could be of some use.
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
	Greg
