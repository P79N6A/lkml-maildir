   Tytso does not like the idea. And after some thinking about the issue, I can
   understand him. It is because
   (1) resolving from the bottom to the top might be more costly than
   static ACLs if no path component checking is needed anymore (path
   component checking is UNIX's Achilles Heel compared to NT) and (2)
   there is no definite parent for files with n_link>1
The difference here is that NT always does path resolution from the
root, whereas in Unix, we do path resolution of relative pathnames
(i.e., those whose pathname don't start with a '/') relative to the
current working directory.
So doing full inheritable ACL's will force the Unix permissions checking
model to be as SLOW as NT.  (Consider how many relative pathnames are
used when doing a kernel compile, for example.)  And oh by the way, it's
not just me who doesn't like this; most of the folks I chatted to at the
OLS thought it was also an insane idea, including sct and alan, and a
number of others.  I very much doubt something like this would ever go
into the VFS core.  (If a filesystem wants to do this in their
filesystem dependent code, and trash their Andrew benchmark scores, they
can feel free to do so.  :-)
   (1) can be circumvented by having a (persistent) ACL change cache in
   reiserfs. When accessing a file, the cache (usually empty) is checked
   against wether the entry in the cache applies to a particular
   file. If the cache entries do not apply to the file, the files ACL is
   checked. This way you can always have inheriting ACLs, make ACL
   changes of millions of files atomic. (Changes place an entry in the
   cache, and a background thread changes the resolved ACL entries in
   every file.)
What are you storing in the cache?  If you are storing the entry for
each directory, you still have to do the full pathname resolution to
find all of the parent directories.  If you are storing cache entries
index by inode number, then each time there is an ACL change, you have
to flush the entire ACL cache.  Also, this doesn't help you if you're
doing something like a kernel compile, since you still have to do the
full pathname resolution for every new file that you've never seen
before.  (Which in the case of the kernel compile, happens a lot.)
