You don't think so?  How come?
Note that this was a clean install, I unpacked
the 2.5.69 tarball, applied 2.5.69-mm3, copied a
.config file, and ran "make oldconfig; make bzImage"
I tried make clean, and still get
kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x102a): In function `schedule':
: undefined reference to `active_load_balance'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x7d534): In function `fb_prepare_logo':
: undefined reference to `find_logo'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
During compile, I got a warning that active_load_balance
was implicitly declared or some such.
Looking at sched.c I see that
active_load_balance is declared if  CONFIG_SHARE_RUNQUEUE
is not set.
Later, if we have CONFIG_SMP _and_ CONFIG_SHARE_RUNQUEUE
we get a longer version of active_load_balance
So, active_load_balance doesn't exist if
CONFIG_SHARE_RUNQUEUE is set on a non-smp machine.
but schedule() later do a call to active_load_balance
that isn't masked by any #ifdef.  This machine isn't SMP,
and CONFIG_SHARE_RUNQUEUE gets set - so it goes wrong.
The problem seems to be in sched.h, which says:
/*
  * Is there a way to do this via Kconfig?
  */
#ifdef CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS_2
# define CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS 2
#elif defined(CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS_4)
# define CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS 4
#else
# define CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS 0
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS
# define CONFIG_SHARE_RUNQUEUE 1
#else
# define CONFIG_SHARE_RUNQUEUE 0
#endif
I get
# define CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS 0
and the #ifdef CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS
test triggers because something #defined
to 0 is #defined.  I guess this is the problem,
and if so, changing the #ifdef CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS
to #if CONFIG_NR_SIBLINGS should do the trick.
A patch for this is at the end of the message.

Yes, thanks!
Patch for the active_load_balance problem.
It is not yet tested, it is compiling right now
and that takes time.
