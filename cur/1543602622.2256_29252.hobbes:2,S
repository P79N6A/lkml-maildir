are you sure timer interrupts are processed while you are waiting for the
timeout to expire? I'd suggest to put a:
	printk("<%d>", irq);
into arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:do_IRQ(). So you can see what kind of
interrupt traffic there is while the device initializes and you are
waiting for it to generate an interrupt.
If you see lots of "<0>"  messages and the sleep_on() is not returning
nevertheless, then something serious is going on - almost nothing can
prevent timers from expiring.
