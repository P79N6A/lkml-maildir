As a further elaboration...
The problem with the current 2.6-rc setup is a _human_ _communications_ 
problem.
Users have been trained in a metaphor that is applied uniformly across 
all software projects that use the metaphor:
	test release:		a useful merge/testing point
	release candidate:	bugfixes only, test test test
Linux does it differently.
It's hard enough to get users to test...   now we have raised the 
barrier even higher by abusing a common metaphor.  A metaphor that is 
used _succesfully_ elsewhere to get users to test.
"release candidate" is a promise to users that the current tree is close 
to what the release will look like, and only major fixes will appear 
between -rc and -final.
We broke that promise.  In human interface terms, this is like 
redefining the "garbage can" icon to mean "save your work."  ;-)
