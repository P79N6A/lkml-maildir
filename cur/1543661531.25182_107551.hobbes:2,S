The wrong thing here is that you pass in the object itself, not
it's ACC-relevant attributes.

No it seems not pointless.  You add tons of undesigned cruft to 2.5 that
will have to be maintained through all of 2.6. unless Linus hopefully
pulls the plug soon enough.  You still haven't even submitted a single
example that actually uses LSM into mainline.
Yes, I'm pissed that we get this crap all over the place, making code
harder to follow and that without any actual benefit to the mainline tree.
Please come up with something better for 2.7 and leave 2.5 alone, this will
help anyone.
