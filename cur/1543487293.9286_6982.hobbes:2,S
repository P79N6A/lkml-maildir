I patched w/ 2.2.2-ac1 and your 2.2.2-uniorm ide patch and rebuilt the
kernel. When I boot, I get the following in dmesg;
ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78
ALI15X3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
ALI15X3: enabled read of IDE channels state (en/dis-abled) Succeeded.

Here's my results using hdparm.
2.2.1-ac6 (Standard IDE Driver)
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  9.44 seconds = 6.78 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  9.43 seconds = 6.79 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  9.44 seconds = 6.78 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  9.51 seconds = 6.73 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  9.39 seconds = 6.82 MB/sec            
2.2.2-ac1-uniform-ide
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  8.09 seconds = 7.91 MB/sec       
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  8.13 seconds = 7.87 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  8.12 seconds = 7.88 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  8.33 seconds = 7.68 MB/sec     
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 10.19 seconds = 6.28 MB/sec  
So.. there is most definitly an improvement. Got any suggestions for a
better disk speed suite than "hdparm"?
