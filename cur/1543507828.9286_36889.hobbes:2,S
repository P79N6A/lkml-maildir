In response to you and David:  I agree :)  But if vendors take this
seriously, I have a feeling a UDI interface will eventually appear. 
Lack of UDI support may be an encouragement or a discouragement,
depending on the complexity of the device driver.
On a related subject, I think Linux could use a much more coherent --
and documented -- device driver interface.  Writing portable Linux
device drivers requires very in-depth knowledge of the Linux 'arch'
code; I find myself checking the Alpha or Sparc arch code a lot to make
sure that the I/O routines and such that I call work as expected.
