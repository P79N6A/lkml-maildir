To an extent.  The problem is not the powernow-k8 driver,
but the cpufreq infrastructure.  See below.

No, but prior to 2.6.10, cpufreq discovers each core
independently, and creates a directory independently.
The powernow-k8 knows which cores are on the same processors,
and handles them together.
After 2.6.10, cpufreq understands multicore devices and
creates 1 directory for the entire processor and then
creates symbolic links for all the cores that share the
same pstates.

It's always the highest requested value of all cores on
a processor.  powernow-k8 keeps track of the requested
frequencies, though, so you can have some weird situations.
ie, from boot up:
	core0 800 MHz	core1 800 MHz	CPU 800 MHz
	core0 to 2000 MHz	core1 800 MHz	CPU 2000 MHz
	core0 2000 MHz	core1 to 1800 MHz	CPU 2000 MHz
	core0 to 800 MHz	core1 1800 MHz	CPU 1800 MHz

That shouldn't happen, unless ondemand requests a low
frequency to all cores.

This should be happening automatically in RHEL4.
Note that the 2.6.10 kernel changed cpufreq behavior
dramatically, and now the most recent frequency request 
wins.
