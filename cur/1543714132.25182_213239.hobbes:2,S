You cannot use same Makefile for both 2.4 and 2.6?
Using the syntax:
make -C $KERNELSRC SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
should allow you to do that if there is no special requirements.
The Makefile should be an ordinary kbuild Makefile in this case:
obj-m := module.o
module-objs := mod1.o mod2.o
etc..
Another approach would be to keep two Makefiles, one for 2.4, another
for 2.6. Default could be Makefile (for 2.6) and Makefile.24 for older kernels.
This makes much less conditionals.
