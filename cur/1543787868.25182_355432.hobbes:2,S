AFAIK Luke never contributed to the FUSE project.  Hopefully that
answers your question.
FUSE and microkernels are sometimes mentioned together, but I believe
there's a very important philosophical difference:
FUSE was created to ease the development and use of a very _special_
group of filesystems.  It was never meant to replace (and never will)
the fantastically efficient and flexible internal filesystem
interfaces in Linux and other monolithic kernels.
On the other hand, the microkernel approach is to restrict _all_
filesystems to the more secure, but less efficient and less flexible
interface.  Which is stupid IMO.
