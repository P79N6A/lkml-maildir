The affects of many top level folks using a non free system is felt all
the way down the food-chain.  If the top tier would agree to use a free
SCM system then we could build bridges and offer the data in the preferred
format to _everyone_  (arch, subversion, patch, BK, etc).  But because BK
is used at the top, many useful options are cut off.   It's a rather large
"hidden" cost of BK adoption as the primary tool at the top.
Cheers,
Sean
