The correct fix for this PITA is for Linus not to ship a broken defconfig.

I hear you.  The problem is that "what's wrong" is not as well-defined
as one might like.  In this case the error could be in the setting of
X86, SMP, or RTC.  CML2 has no way to know which of these is mis-set, so
it can't know which one to pop up..

USB and SCSI are both enabled/disabled in the system buses menu.  The

I know.  Sadly, I couldn't find a way to coerce Tcl into doing this right.

That's on my to-do list.  It's low-priority, though, since I figure 
most people will use menuconfig.
