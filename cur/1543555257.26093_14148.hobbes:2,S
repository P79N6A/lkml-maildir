This may not be helpful (and the thread is now two days
old), but I just wanted to add that after using Mr.
Torvalds' comment-out-irq13 suggestion and Vojtech
Pavlik's "Possible critical VIA vt82c686a chip bug"
patch (Oct 26), both with 2.4.0-t10, I've successfully
had a 2.4 series uptime >48 hours for the first time
with an Athlon/KX133 setup! Whopee!
Hopefully both of these are incorporated in some way
into 2.4.0-t11? I'm about to test it out...
Thanks all... I'm just so overjoyed. *sniff*
