Oh.  I thought from all the 'IRQ routing/balancing' and the like in the
kernel there might be a way to switch things around, give the
Realtek driver a different IRQ than the one being used by the ide driver.
Just my crossed-fingers hope.

It's attached as file 'dmesg.bug.out'.

I tried both options, but in both cases there was no difference; the ide_cd_mod
module was still loaded and the 'confused' message still popped up.
I did four boots/tests of the 2.6.25-rc2 kernel, with and without those
boot parameters ... on all four I had the 'confused' message several times:
hda: cdrom_newpc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01).
Trying to recover by ending request.
but in one - the boot with hda=noprobe - I got pages of these
error messages right after:
hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: drive not ready for command
hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: drive not ready for command
hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: drive not ready for command
hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: drive not ready for command
hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: DMA disabled
hda: ATAPI reset complete
hda: cdrom_decode_status: status=0xc0 { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit
hda: ATAPI reset complete
...
and the system essentially hung.  I don't know if that was due to the
'hda=noprobe' or if that extra sensitivity is seen only every now and then.

I tried to apply the patch but failed; I probably did something wrong.
I deleted everything in your message above 'Index: b/drivers/ide/ide-cd.c'
and ran 'patch --dry-run -b -p1 < ../bart_patch'.  This is part of my script
log:

Since it found drivers/ide/ide-cd.c I guess I got the '-p' level right (?),
and that's about the sum total of my 'patch' experience to date.
Sorry.  Can you tell me what I did wrong?
Cheers,
Brad
