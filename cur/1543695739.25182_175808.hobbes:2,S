Hi there,
I am working on providing a cyclic scheduling policy
to the current non real time version of the linux to
support hard real time tasks as part of one of my
projects. This policy should be able to support
aperiodic, periodic and sporadic tasks too. Could any
one pour some light on how to go about achieving it?.
Any Helpful tips, project reports, links or advices
are greatly appreciated.
Thanks and Regards,
LQ
