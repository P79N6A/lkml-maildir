Less good.

The driver uses 2 ways of finding SiS Ide chips :
- by northbridge PCI ids, which is what was always used historically 
(and so you had to manually add each known SiS northbridge to a table),
- by probing the controller directly (avoids depending on a lazy coder 
to add entries in a table to make your chip work).
When the last was added, some PCI ids were removed from the table (being 
superfluous).
The very fact that the sis5513.c outputs something in your log means 
that it has found something to handle, so the detection routine 
(whichever it is) works.
I think there's a common problem with SiS chips : interrupt handling. I 
believe it is the source of your problem. I may find time to hack on this.
You could try to remove PCI cards and/or disable VGA IRQ in the bios. On 
one of my SiS-based systems for example adding a PCI card can make it 
unbootable.
