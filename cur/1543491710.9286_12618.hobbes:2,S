Subject: removing a mounted loopback file works

I am using kernel 2.2.4 and mount-2.9i.  I have a file slink1-i386.raw
(iso image).  I can mount the file successfully using "mount
slink1-i386.raw /mnt -o loop" using /dev/loop0. 
But then I can remove the file slink1-i386.raw while it is mounted.  After
removing it, it's still listed as in use by mtab, /proc/mounts, and
losetup /dev/loop0, and I can still access the filesystem through /mnt.
If I try to unmount it then it takes longer than if I had not removed the
file.  
I assume that /mnt is reading into unallocated inodes, and I assume that I
could cause corrupt "ls" listings by filling up my disk (to ensure the
inodes that were taken up by the mounted file are overwritten).  I didn't
try doing this because I have no idea what other damage might occur.
I think the correct behavior is for "rm" to return an error (permission
denied, or some other error) if I try to remove the last (hard) link to a
mounted file.
