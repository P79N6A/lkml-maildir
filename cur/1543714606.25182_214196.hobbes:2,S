We don't do page migration. It has proved extraordinarily hard to know when
to migrate pages correctly ... in conjunction with the cross-node movement
of tasks.

We can do that for read-only mappings and kernel text already. Dave Hansen
did a patch for the read-only mappings, though I need to update it to the
latest kernel tree.
