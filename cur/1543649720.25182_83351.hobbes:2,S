Hmm, this statement suggests the author misunderstands the Unix-based
conventional use of the separated fork/exec calls.  After the fork
call, the child process is still running code common to the parent,
but typically (by convention) a different leg of an if-then-else
statement.  This code in this leg can reduce resource limits before
make an exec call to start a new program.  The parent's limits are
not affected.  There's no need to change the kernel.
