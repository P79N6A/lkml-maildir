speaking of living in module memory, a similar thing happens with the
via-rhine driver. after my machine has been up for a few hours the
"via-rhine" string in /proc/iomem and /proc/ioports gets over written
and prints garbage. since this has never been the cause for an oops on
my machine i never bothered reporting it. if anyone wants details i'll
provide.
