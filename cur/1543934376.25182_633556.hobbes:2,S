No, I mean osd_off_t :)  off vs offset is purely cosmetic, but in Linux
we have a strong preference for short typenames.  Just look how ugly
the prototype and struct defintion in your original posting look :)
Also I thing the _cdb is superflous because there is no other offset
type in the OSD spec.
