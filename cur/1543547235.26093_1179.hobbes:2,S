I think that's close to Linus' idea.
But it reminds me more a fork()+exec() rather than a simple exec().
OK. I'm clueless C programmer. I write:
program A:
  pid = getpid();	/* imagine is 300 */
  ...
  exec("program B");
program B:
  ...
  pid = getpid();	/* I'm expecting 300 */
Then I modify A:
program A2:
  pid = getpid();	/* 400 */
  if (!fork()) {
	exec("program B);
  }
  ...
program B:
  ...
  pid = getpid();	/* I'm expecting != 400 */
This is ok because that's what I asked for.
Suppose I make a MT version of A. It would behave just like A2.
The thread who's performing the exec() becomes a different process
and program B sees a different pid.
It's like saying: an exec() in a MT process behaves like a fork()+exec()
sequence in a normal process.
I'm not really against it... it's just a little weird.
Killing all threads, and doing a "real" exec(), leads to the expected
semantic. Of course, since you should expect the "defined" semantic,
that matter is about choosing the definition. B-)
BTW, I don't think it needs to be a kernel matter. exec() in a MT 
program can be defined to kill all threads in userland before doing
the exec().

Do you consider the above problem "critical"?  B-)
