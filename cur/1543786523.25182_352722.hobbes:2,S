Yes this is a bug, since most Linux portmapper will not
allow ports to be set or unset using non-privilege ports.
But non-privilege ports can be used to get ports information.
So I would suggest the following patch that stops the
use of privileges ports on only get port requests.
steved.
Privilege ports are need for services to set and unset ports, but
are not needed to get ports. This patch eliminates the use of
privilege ports for PMAP_GETPORT rpcs and restores the use
of privilege ports for PMAP_SET  and  PMAP_UNSET rpcs.
