Over time as patches succeed more I reduce testing so I can "get things done 
faster".  Eventually I screw up, and get more cautious on checking.  It's a 
dynamic balance.
With reduced review comes sloppier code.  If we can't increase review, we can 
at least increase the penalty for screwing up when I do get caught.
If vger dropped all my emails for a week after I broke the kernel, I'd be far 
more careful OR I'd find efficient ways to avoid doing that (like increasing 
review, or automated testing).  Either way, it's a win.
But I'm sure everyone else is far more disciplined than I...
