To facilitate the comparative evaluation of the two CPU schedulers 
described above they have been combined into a single patch with the 
capability to switch between the to schedulers at run time.  This patch 
is available for download at:
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/patch-2.6.7-HYDRA_SC-v1.0.gz>
The file /proc/sys/kernel/cpusched/mode has been added to those 
described above to control which of the schedulers is in control.  The 
string "sc" is used to select the staircase scheduler and "pb" to select 
the priority based scheduler described above.  The staircase scheduler 
control parameters "compute" and "interactive" have been moved into 
/proc/sys/kernel/cpusched along with the other scheduler control 
parameters.  A primitive Glade/PyGTK GUI that provides the ability to 
switch between schedulers and to control scheduler parameters is 
available at:
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/gcpuctl_hydra.tar.gz>
NB
1. None of the priority based scheduler control parameters will have any 
effect when the staircase scheduler is in charge but the staircase 
"compute" parameter will effect preemption for the priority based scheduler.
2. The staircase scheduler is based on Con's version 6.E and does not 
contain his latest fixes but will be updated when he releases his next 
patch.
