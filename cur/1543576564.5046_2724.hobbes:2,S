Then what do you do when you are behind a NAT? And how do you expire entries in
ESTABLISHED state that could stay lingering forever without some sort of
keepalive? (The FINs might have been lost due to a conectivity transient, so
you can have another perfectly valid and alive connection with the same host,
and application-level timeouts are useless for some applications
(*cough*nc*cough*))
