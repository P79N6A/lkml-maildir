Patchset looks nice, Andy. Page allocator stuff looks fine, just
a couple of questions about the setup and alignment stuff:

We also need to align the end of the zone I think? I think we should
try to force alignment by reducing the size here, or if that is not
possible, then panic?
If we don't either fix it or panic, then we're allowing users' machines
to run in an unstable state.
