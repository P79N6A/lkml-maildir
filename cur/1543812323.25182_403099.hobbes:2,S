Perhaps you need to uninstall your old modutils installation? I know
that modutils and module-init-tools can exist on the same machine, but
it might be easier and clearer to know which one is causing problems
if you have just one installed.

I've always used depmod -a.
But again, be sure you're using the module-init-tools version of
depmod and not your old modutils copy.
