  But you can not use exactly same shutdown function with both pci and platform glue. You need to
convert pci/platform device to hcd anyway, right ? So this will add 2 doing 'virtually nothing'
routines anyway (unless you just want to duplicate the code of shutdown routine for for platform
glue). For ohci, you would need to do the same, hence 2 more routines, 4 total. With bus glue, I
added just 2. Am I missing something here ?

My bad. I did not find notifier, but shutdown handler is indeed there. However, uhci is different
in a way it does not use platform driver.
