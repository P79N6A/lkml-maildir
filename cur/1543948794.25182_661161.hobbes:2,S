Subject: [PATCH] Remove never-migrates assumption from rcu_process_callbacks()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello again!
This patch fixes a potentially invalid access to a per-CPU variable in
rcu_process_callbacks().  This per-CPU access needs to be done in such
a way as to guarantee that the code using it cannot move to some other
CPU before all uses of the value accessed have completed.  Even though
this code is currently only invoked from softirq context, which currrently
cannot migrate to some other CPU, life would be better if this
code did not silently make such an assumption.
