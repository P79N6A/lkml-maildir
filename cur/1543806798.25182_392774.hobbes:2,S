[RFC][PATCH] VPIDs: Virtualization of PIDs (OpenVZ approach)
OpenVZ project would like to present another approach for VPIDs 
developed by Alexey Kuznetsov. These patches were heavily tested and 
used for half a year in OpenVZ already.
OpenVZ VPIDs serves the same purpose of VPS (container) checkpointing 
and restore. OpenVZ VPS checkpointing code will be released soon.
These VPIDs patches look less intrusive than IBM's, so I would ask to 
consider it for inclusion. Other projects can benefit from this code as 
well.
Patch set consists of 7 patches.
The main patches are:
- diff-vpids-macro, which introduces pid access interface
- diff-vpids-core, which introduces pid translations where required 
using new interfaces
- diff-vpids-virt, which introduces virtual pids handling in pid.c and 
pid mappings for VPSs
Patches are against latest 2.6.16-rc1-git6
