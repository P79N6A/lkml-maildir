Hi,
Looks pretty interesting! some comments:
- patch 4/7 hasn't made it to the list?
- it would be useful for reviewing this if you could post example code
  making use of the /dev/kvm interfaces - they seem fairly complex.
- why do it this way rather than through a virtual machine monitor
  such as Xen? what do you gain from having the virtual machines
  encapsulated as Linux processes?
Cheers,
Muli
