Hi Marcelo,
I have a total of 5 patches with minor fixes to the Linux 2.4 i2c
subsystem and documentation. These fixes I gathered for the past few
months as they were applied to the Linux 2.6 tree and to the i2c CVS
repository.
Individual patches will be posted in reply to this post, with
explanations and diffstat. Please consider applying them.
Thanks.
