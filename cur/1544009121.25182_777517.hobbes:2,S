Getting that the same userspace runs ok in 2.6.27 and config changes do
not show immediate reason, I would blame some internal changes in some
kernel subsystem. Why at first it infinitely loops in tty/console loading?
I can not run bisect, since reboot requires vnc and I'm far from fast
channel. Build of the fresh tree with existing config takes almost
one hour, but it should not be a major problem.
I can do bisection after the weekend, but can test some changes before
machine froze with unsuccessful patch.
