Yes.

Well, depending on nice level this delay may be more than 45sec.
And, in cfs-v8 there is an additional repeating latency blip akin to an 
expiry when running procs at different nice levels.  chew.c shows this 
clearly.

Actually, I think 1/32 for +10 is a bit to strong.  Introducing a scalefactor 
tunable may be useful.
Also, don't you think it reasonable to lower-bound the timeslices?
Thanks!
