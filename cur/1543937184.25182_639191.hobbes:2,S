Just to expand a bit on the design-side of my proposal :
Your module would create "profiles" based on the hooks called. If we
take the interrupt on/off for example, it would be called by lockdep and
could keep a table of the top X instructions that disables interrupts
for a long time. (it's just an example, you could want to save the pid
instead...)
Then, whenever a "profile dump" is triggered, you would simply have to
send the current state of your profile to lttng with something like :
struct irq_latency_table {
  void *ip;
  cycles_t time;
};
/*
 * Make sure only one profile at a time is written to the trace for the
 * whole system.
 */
static DECLARE_MUTEX(latency_profile_mutex);
static struct irq_latency_table latency_table[NR_ENTRIES];
void irq_latency_dump_profile(void)
{
  int i;
  char namebuf[KSYM_NAME_LEN];
  mutex_lock(&latency_profile_mutex);
  trace_mark(irq_latency_dump_begin, MARK_NOARGS);
  for (i = 0; i < NR_ENTRIES; i++) {
    sprint_symbol(namebuf, (unsigned long)latency_table[i].ip);
    trace_mark(irq_latency_entry, "ip %p symbol %s time %llu",
      latency_table[i].ip, namebuf,
      (unsigned long long)latency_table[i].time);
  }
  trace_mark(irq_latency_dump_end, MARK_NOARGS);
  mutex_unlock(&latency_profile_mutex);
}
You can then create a LTTV module that will format your nice output each
time a profile dump is encountered.
By doing this, your specialized profile generator would only have to
hook into the irq on/off events to gather the information it needs,
nothing more. I think that would trim the code size and the complexity
of your module by an interesting factor.
Note that I could optimize the way I currently deal with symbols by not
having to dump them in the trace, but since it's only for low rate
events, this optimization has a low priority on my todo list.
