For the last time, you are *not* talking about ASCII.  ASCII only
defines 95 printable characters (32-126).  You are talking about IBM's
code page 437, used on some legacy systems because it matches the font
built into many CGA video cards.
You may have a look at existing library code (i.e. ncurses or newt), or
read "xterm.seq" from the rxvt source (in Debian see
/usr/doc/rxvt/xterm.seq.gz), which talks about switching character sets
using VT100 escape sequences.  VT100 emulation, by the way, is almost
as ubiquitous in the Linux/Unix world as CP437 is in the MSDOS world.
Although you're still better off going through one of the termcap/info
libraries so you aren't assuming anything.
