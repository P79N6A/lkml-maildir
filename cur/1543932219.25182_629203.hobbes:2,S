Besides the two reports of freezes on bugzilla.kernel.org (9511, 6307), 
the following two bug reports on bugzilla.redhat.com are almost 
certainly due to the same cause (imo, of course): 245834, 227234.
Ubuntu launchpad bug 158849 also seems to report the same problem, for 
an HP dv6258se 64-bit machine.
Also this one:

If you want to collect dmidecode data from these folks, perhaps we might 
get a wider sense of what categories of machines are affected.  They all 
seem to be recemt HP and Compaq AMD64 laptops, probably all Quanta 
motherboards.
