It's just a (pretty stupid) authentication sequence. Some DVD's
contain encrypted blocks that the drive will refuse to read, if it
has not been authenticated. Not all DVD's are encrypted though.
And let me just add that the kernel doesn't contain any of the
crypto stuff, it just provides the hooks and acts as a blissfully
ignorant messenger :)
