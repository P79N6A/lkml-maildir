Hi.
I seem to have found out that depending on whether or not multicast
loopback is enabled outgoing multicast packets with ttl set to 0 are
treated differently.  
In both cases I set ttl of outgoing packets to 0 (with
IP_MULTICAST_TTL setsockopt).  If multicast loop is enabled, packets
remain local for the machine and are not sent onto the wire (expected
behavior).  However, if I disable multicast loopback, packets with ttl
0 show up on the wire.  Is this a bug or I'm missing something?
Kernel version is 2.4.3-12.
Thanks,
