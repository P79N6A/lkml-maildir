Sorry for not catching this one earlier..  Sometime between 2.6.18-rc4-mm2
and -mm3, something crept into the git-cryptodev.patch that breaks mounting
encrypted disks.  What I have in /etc/fstab:
/dev/rootvg/crypto1     /crypto/mount_dir    ext3    nodev,nosuid,noexec,noauto,noatime,nodiratime,user,loop,encryption=aes 1 0
This worked in -mm2, and a bisect of -mm patches points git-cryptodev as
the problem, so it's one of the commits in that patch between -mm2 and -mm3.
/sbin/mount is able to set up the loopback, but then gets an error that
no valid superblock was found - which says to me that it's not treating the
passphrase or something the same, and decrypting to something other than what
the -mm2 kernel decrypted the superblock to.
My personal guess as "most likely suspect" (only obvious hit on cryptoloop):

    [BLOCK] cryptoloop: Use block ciphers where applicable
    This patch converts cryptoloop to use the new block cipher type where
    applicable.  As a result the ECB-specific and CBC-specific transfer
    functions have been merged.

but I have *not* extracted that one GIT commit to test it yet.
