hi,
I'm trying to understand the rtl genrated by gcc for mips processor.I
have read gcc internals by Richard Stallman but there  are still some
confusions in the rtl language.
Following is a snippet of code which i'm trying to understand.
(insn 9 6 10 (nil) (set (reg:SI 182)
        (mem/f:SI (symbol_ref:SI ("a")) [0 a+0 S4 A32])) -1 (nil)
    (nil))
In the above code following part is still unclear to me
[0 a+0 S4 A32])) -1 (nil)
    (nil))
Following is the c code for which above rtl is generated :
int a;
main()
{
a=a+1;
}
thanks,
shahzad
