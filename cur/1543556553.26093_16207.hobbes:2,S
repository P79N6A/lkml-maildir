wrong -- time is wasted -- 1 decb for lock and 1 movb for unlock. No time
is wasted on spinning but 2 instructions wasted for taking/dropping the
lock.

Of course, they are worth it. Actually, I don't understand how can you
even doubt it? Even a single cycle of code executed for _no reason_ must
be removed, if for no other reason than to make the code easier to
understand and prevent people from asking questions like "why does X do Y
for no reason?" -- if there are no such items "Y" then the questions will
also cease.
