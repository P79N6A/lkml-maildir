If both endian modes are really equivalent for the hardware, then the
right choice may depend on the following: 
- If you are a purist, you may just toss a coin to decide, since none 
  endian mode is superior to the other one.
- If you are rather pragmatic, you want to choose the endian mode of 
  the architecture that has the best Linux support, thus little endian.
  (You must also think about all other tools needed for the O/S, and that 
   may have to deal with endianness).
