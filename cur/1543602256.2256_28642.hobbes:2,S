I am in the process of compiling a more upto date
kernel for my Mandrake 8.0 installation (for the first
time).
I am using 'make xconfig' to help me get things set
correctly.
I have a Netgear FA-310TX Card, but under the list of
available drivers to install - it dosen't list the
310TX.
What would be the next best choice ?
Pete
