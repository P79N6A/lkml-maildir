Ok. That solves one problem, but it does seem to point to the fact that 
2.6.x calls down to poll() more than 2.4.x does.
It really _is_ normal to have multiple calls to "poll()" for the same fd 
as a result of a single "poll()" system call, but if we actually get a 
positive hit (ie the ->poll() call returns a bit that we consider to be a 
success by comparing it to what we _wanted_ to see), then we should have 
stopped doing that.
And since your test program always sets "POLLIN", any ->poll() call that 
has the POLLIN flag set should have ended up being the last one (since it 
would have marked a "success"). 
So there's still something I don't understand, and that seems to differ
between 2.4.x and 2.6.x. Can anybody else see it?
