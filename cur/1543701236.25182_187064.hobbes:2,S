Where can I learn about ICH5 SATA RAID driver in Linux kernel 2.6.0?  I
have been looking into Documentation/scsi and found nothing containing
the word "ICH5" or named *ich5*. Also the help page in make menuconfig
says nothing. I would like to know the following:
1) features supported
2) interface specification
3) usage guide
