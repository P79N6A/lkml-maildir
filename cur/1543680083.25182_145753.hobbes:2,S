  as per thread on lkml a little while ago, a better explanation
  of the X86_GENERIC config option follows. The person who questioned
  it originally seemed to like this improved version, so that's one point :)

-       	  Including some tuning for non selected x86 CPUs too.
-	  when it has moderate overhead. This is intended for generic 
-	  distributions kernels.
+	  Instead of just including optimizations for the selected
+	  x86 variant (e.g. PII, Crusoe or Athlon), include some more
+	  generic optimizations as well. This will make the kernel
+	  perform better on x86 CPUs other than that selected.
+
+	  This is really intended for distributors who need more
+	  generic optimizations.
