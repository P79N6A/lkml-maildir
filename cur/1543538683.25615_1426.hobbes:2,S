Hello all,
	I just wanted to write and tell my experience with USB in the 2.4-test3
menuconfig.  When I entered the menu, I found USB support, and Joystick
support, already enabled as modules.  I quickly changed the device
support to be compiled in, and added other drivers to be compiled in as
well.  I leave, and finish my setup.  As I'm going back thru, checking
everything, making sure I didnt' miss any options.  I find out that ALL
my USB selections have changed to compile as modules only.  No matter
what I do, it always stays as modules.  I just thought I'd let everyone
know of this little bug.  Thanks for listening.
