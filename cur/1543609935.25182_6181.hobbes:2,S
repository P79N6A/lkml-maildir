Confirm.. I am speaking of the 2.4.14 kernel, not the 2.2.14 kernel..
And I am trying to compile support directly into the kernel, without
using modules..
The default kernel with 7.2 doens't work with more than 512 MG Ram for
some reason, as it is having IO problems, and that is why I am trying to
chase this down
