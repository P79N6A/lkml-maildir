ok, it's great that people are picking up -ck. What i was trying to 
figure out here was whether this is a vanilla-O(1)->CFS, SD->CFS or 
CFS.23->CFS.24 comparison. It seems it's probably a CFS.23->CFS.24 
comparison. I'd also be interested in those people's impressions about 
CFSv24 who previously found SD to be superior to earlier CFS versions. 
If there's still any regression (interactivity or other) we might still 
be able to fix it before 2.6.24 is released.
