The VM won't see that you have struct pages backing the ptes, and won't
do the right refcounting or rmap stuff... But for file backed mappings,
all the critical rmap stuff should be set up at mmap time, so you might
have another option to simply always do the nopfn thing, as far as the
VM is concerned (ie. even when you do have a struct page)
