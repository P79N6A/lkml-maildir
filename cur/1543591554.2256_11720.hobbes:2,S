Repost because I got no answer :(
But I have added new information.
2.4.4-ac9 did compile for me with CONFIG_RWSEM_GENERIC_* on.
But it freezes when accessing the floppy.
And it freezes during sound playback.
My laptop (Scenic Mobile 510 from Siemens) has an onboard ESS1869
which works fine with 2.4.3-ac7 and Andres's generic-rwsem patch
(retested).
I thought it only would freeze on keypress during these ops but yesterday
it did so even during playback without any keypress.
I have no logs or similar, because it froze, but e2fsck annoys me :)
If any of you has a clue why this could be, thanks. I'll try -ac11 later
(need a rwsem solution for gcc-3 first). May I really use RWSEM_GENERIC?
Or shall I do CONFIG_M386 then?
Actually it is a P][ Deschutes with upgrade to stepping 45 on /dev/microcode,
APM is on (no ACPI support) and the UP-APIC cannot be enabled so I dont compile
it on any longer.
On request I can give more information.
TIA
