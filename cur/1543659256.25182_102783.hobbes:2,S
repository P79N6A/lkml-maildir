Greg,
Something strange with 2.5.56.  My usb mouse is no longer working
after boot.  I can get it to work by repluging it.  Here is my
dmesg ang the init.d/local that should make sure the modules needed 
are loaded.  Before tring to replug I unloaded and reloaded hid and
psmouse to see if this would fix things (it did not).
I suspect the changeset below:
ChangeSet@1.889.19.1, 2003-01-09 10:29:40-08:00, greg@kroah.com
which got added just before .56 - I have been tracking bk fairly
closely and all was working up to the version of 55bk built at 8am
on the 9th.
Ideas?
