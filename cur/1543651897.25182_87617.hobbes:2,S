For /usr/src and the kernel distribution? Or for the whole boot process?
I use NFS already for several shared filesystems. NFS isn't quite
specific enough that I understand what you mean.
Could you give me a little more detail on exactly what you would use it
for? If I've overlooked a howto or obvious document please RTFM me- I'm
trying to learn from the pros here and would ideally like something that
will scale well to over 100 machines.
