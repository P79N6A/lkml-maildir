Simple solution. Add psmouse_resolution=200 to the boot options. No skip,
smooth mouse. All is good.
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.0-test9-mm2
        label=260-test9-mm2
        root=/dev/hda5
        read-only
        append=" devfs=mount acpi=on resume=/dev/hda1 psmouse_resolution=200"
        initrd=/boot/initrd-2.6.0-test9-mm2.img
