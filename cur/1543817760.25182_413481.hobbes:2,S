Well, if you look at the current ALSA code, the only typedefs provided
are for backwards compatibility.  They were all removed from the drivers
months ago.  The problem is that you were working against old code.  The
main coding style rule is to follow the conventions of the nearby code,
which would mean no typedefs in the ALSA driver case.
