That would not work either.
You need to tell kbuild both where to find the source and the output files.
So you have to specify both -C ... and O=...
KERNEL=/lib/modules/`uname -r`
make -C $KERNEL/source O=$KERNEL/build M=`pwd`
There is no way to do the proposed chang and be backward compatible
when the kernel is build using seperate output directories.
Think of the following situation
/usr/src/linux-2.6.6-xx/  <= kernel src
/lib/modules/linux-2.6.6-xx-smp/build/ <= output files (or a symlink to them)
/lib/modules/linux-2.6.6-xx-smp/source/ <= symlink to kernel src
/lib/modules/linux-2.6.6-xx-up/build/ <= output files (or symlink)
/lib/modules/linux-2.6.6-xx-up/source/ <= symlink to kernel src
/lib/modules/linux-2.6.6-xx-4g/build/ <= output files (or symlink)
/lib/modules/linux-2.6.6-xx-4g/source/ <= symlink to kernel src
Notice they all share the _same_ kernel src.
We just have three different .config files.
If there is a way to be backward compatible with
this feature please demonstrate it.
Plese note that the patch Andreas made did not break existing setups
if a seperate output directory was not used. The only effect
would be an additional symlink to the same dir. (build and source would
be links to the same dir).
Andreas - please expalin why you want build to be a symlink, and not
the directory used when actually building the kernel.
