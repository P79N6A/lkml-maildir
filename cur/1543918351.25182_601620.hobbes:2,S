not sure this is going to help; I mean, the load gets only updated in 
actual timer interrupts... and on a tickless system there's very few 
of those around..... and usually at places round_jiffies() already put 
a timer on.
(also.. one thing that might make Chuck's theory wrong is that the 
sampling code doesn't sample timer activity since that's run just 
after the sampler in the same irq)
