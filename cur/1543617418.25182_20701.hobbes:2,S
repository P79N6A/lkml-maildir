typically logging must also occur as some other user than what the daemon
runs as, or else your logs are suspect in any sort of break-in.  this is
no problem for stuff using syslog, but since that's not the default
configuration for apache you might want to put a note in any docs you end
up including.  one suggestion is piped logging through a setuid logger
(setuid to user wwwlogs or something, root not required).
