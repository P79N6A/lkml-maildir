The recent updates to sk98lin do not adhere to Linux coding standards so have
been rejected by the network driver maintainers.
Most of sk98lin has been reimplemented as the skge driver, to be included in
2.6.13. This driver covers the original yukon cards.
In time, another new driver will be written for the yukon-II range. To assist,
you could write to the linux-netdev mailing list, offering to test any new
drivers once they go into development.
