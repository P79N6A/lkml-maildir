Nope, I don't think it's the right thing to do. Either we want to pass a
type down or a profile of some sort.
For the work you are doing here, just forget about it. It's not like
it's a critical piece, just list in the README (or wherever) that noop
is a good choice and leave it at that.

I think you'll find the runtime overhead of them is pretty close and
hard to measure in most setups, it's things like the queue idling and
anticipation that AS/CFQ might do that will potentially decrease your io
performance. deadline and noop would be equally good choices.
So you don't want to pass down hints on "use noop", you really want to
tell the block layer that you have no seek penalty for instance. And a
range of other parameters.
