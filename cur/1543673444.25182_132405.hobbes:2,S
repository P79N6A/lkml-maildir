They are also identical to my messages :) USB was working perfectly with
acpi untill 2.5.69, then it suddenly stopped working, and I have to boot
with acpi=off :(
There seems to be many USB/ACPI problems, but few of them started with
2.5.69. Just yours, Dave's and my problem so far...
Best regards,
Stian
