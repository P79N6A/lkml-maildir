According to this last reason, most of the features added to the stable
tree never havent been merged because that features will be included in
development series... :)
Why many drivers are backported from 2.5/2.6 series to 2.4? I think the
reason is because is good for stable series take a few bits from latest
kernel code for prevent obsolete and/or very old drivers.
I know this have some risks of generating more bugs in stable kernel,
but in many times, has been made backports without so much resistance ;)
