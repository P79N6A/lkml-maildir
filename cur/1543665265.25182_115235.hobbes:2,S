Something in current -bk breaks the NUMA scheduler.
Kernbench: (make -j N vmlinux, where N = 16 x num_cpus)
                              Elapsed      System        User         CPU
             2.5.64-align       46.29      129.38      567.02     1504.75
                2.5.64-bk      153.04       49.05      558.30      395.00
Looks like it's not node-balancing at all and just using one node.
However, I spent a few minutes looking, and can't see anything obvious
that would have caused it.
Will look at it some more tommorow when I wake up, but if any of you
can see what's broken of the top of your head ...
