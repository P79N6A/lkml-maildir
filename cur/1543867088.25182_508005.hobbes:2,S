That's a bit surprising - the initcall levels don't affect modules. 
Presumably something went wrong in core kernel which later caused yenta
and/or 8139too to fail.
Have you tried diffing the before- and after-dmesgs to see if that particular
commit has caused any interesting differences?
And are you able to test any other cardbus devices to see whether it's
specific to 8139too?
