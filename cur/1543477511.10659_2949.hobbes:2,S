Probably.  You need to get the filesystem into catatonic mode; it will
automatically go to catatonic mode if it tries to write to the pipe
(i.e. do a mount) and find the other end is no longer connected, or
there is an AUTOFS_IOC_CATATONIC ioctl() that does that (which the
daemon issues during shutdown.)
