I think with directory readahead Marcelo meant a transparent kernel
heuristic in the readdir path. ext2_get_page is completly synchronous
and it's reading one page at time, that's bad but it can be improved
transparently to userspace, just like we do with the files, and also
like the old code was doing before the directory in pagecache IIRC.
I don't see a real benefit in the sys_readahead code compared to just
reading the files, except it doesn't mark the pagecache referenced, but
I think activating the cache of the tree is ok in those special cases.
Also I believe in those cases we want to trim the active cache, not only
the inactive cache, in order to run diff faster, and we probably want
the tree in active cache too ASAP in case we need to run some more diff.
