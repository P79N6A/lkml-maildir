Whoa, kind of harsh, isn't it? I'm just trying to help.
Anyway, the problem at hand is: people do *not* think there is anything 
obvious.
For instance: many, many people do not consider binary hexdumps in .c/.h 
files as source code; if you think so, you should state it in writing, 
you know, to avoid lawyer attacks.
Another example: if you think it's obvious that the binary hexdump is 
another work, aggregated to the GPL'd .c/.h file, then you should state 
(again, in writing) which are the licensing terms of said work... 
otherwise, no-one has a written license to redistribute it, leading 
to... lawyer attacks.
HTH,
Massa
