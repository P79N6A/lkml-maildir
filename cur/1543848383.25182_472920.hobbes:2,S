If we're looking for unchecked boot-time allocation failures then I'd say
no, there's not much point in adding code to check for these.  We tend to
assume that the machine has enough memory to boot the kernel and initial
userspace.
That being said, some boot-time allocations are in code which could also
have been compiled into a module, so we do want to be checking those,
because we do care about memory-allocation failures at modprobe time.  But
we can check for these by building the relevant driver as a module and then
testing it.
And the "if it's positive it's a pid, if it's negative it's a tgid"
interface is rather unpleasant - if we're going to do this we should use
separate control files, or use something like
	echo "pid=1234" > /proc/process_filter
	echo "tgid=4321" > /proc/process_filter
