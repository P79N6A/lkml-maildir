Hi.
I thought that the readership of the list might be interested in some
quick results with Trond's latest v3 client against a solaris7 server.  
Note that these are from a single run over a network that was quiet but
not completely without other traffic.
All tests:  solaris7 server, numbers produced by bonnie with filesize 50 mbytes.
The network is 10mbits/sec ethernet.  The server and client are separated by
both a passive hub and a smart switching hub.

2.2.14(v2)     245  3.4   156  0.2   352  0.6  7535 99.9 254938 99.6 173.3  0.9
2.2.14(v3-udp) 690 10.1   705  1.0   567  1.2  7337 99.3 250028 97.7 613.1  2.9
2.2.14(v3-tcp) 582  8.5   861  0.7   865  1.0  7373 99.8 254065 99.2  46.7  0.4
solaris7       922 16.3   851  2.1   523  1.8   919 13.1    947  1.6  26.1  2.1
Even with these simple numbers (with admittedly high variance), I can
see a dramatic improvement as compared to the stock 2.2.14 v2 client.
For reference, I've included as the last line the performance of a
solaris7 client to the same server through the same network hubs as the
linux machines.
When I first started using linux nfs, the thoughput to solaris was a mere
50 K/sec!  Thanks to everyone for the hard work that has made these 
dramatic improvements possible!
