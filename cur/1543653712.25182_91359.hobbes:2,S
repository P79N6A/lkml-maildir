The problem with sizeof(void *) being >= sizeof(__uint64_t) is that the
data structure is the wrong length. Binary compatibility would not be
maintained.
Still... I believe that the days of 128-bit pointers are comfortably
far enough away that it does not cause any concerns at all for me. (I
suspect the kernel will need quite a few more changes than just this
to support 128-bit poitners...)
