I've updated the patch, but not the binaries yet.  Get it from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=429
 - it's 
patch-2.3.48.bz2.
In other news, I've brought up the lxr source browser on the port at 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/lxr/http/source.
I've also started working on a source of the source.  So far, I've got 
writeups of the port's overall organization, its system call mechanism, and 
the network driver.  I'd appreciate any comments that anyone has on this.
