It was outside, but it wasn't independent -- and _that_ I think was the
source of confusion.
CONFIG_ACPI depended on CONFIG_ACPI_HT.  This looked good on paper
because CONFIG_ACPI_HT is a sub-set of CONFIG_ACPI...
But people who wanted ACPI but didn't want HT (eg. everybody with a PIII
laptop...) were perplexed that they had to "enable HT" in order to get
ACPI.

Yes, except I think we should keep the name CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY since it
says exactly what it does.
Hopefully I can make it looke clear in the menus --
I think on the config menus for CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY and CONFIG_ACPI
should be mutually exclusive.

The question about configs is independent of the acpitable.[ch] vs
table.c implementation.  No, we should not return to maintaining two
copies of the acpi table code.
