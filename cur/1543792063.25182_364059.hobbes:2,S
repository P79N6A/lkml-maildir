You likely are.. and this is also quite distribution specific so a 
distribution support forum would likely be a better place to ask.
Whether or not you need an initrd depends on whether or not drivers 
needed to mount the root filesystem are compiled as modules or built 
into the kernel. If they are all built in then you shouldn't really need 
an initrd. However distributions usually use it so that the kernel can 
be the same for all systems and simply load the correct modules.
