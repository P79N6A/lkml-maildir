Hi,
I found a way to lock up 2.3.29.
I connect to the internet via isdn (fritz!pci), break the connection and use
krn to read a large newsgroup causing it to go oom.
I have had 2 solid lockups and once the kernel went oom and killed 4 tasks.
Using krn without the previous isdn connection causes no harm, krn dies with
sigkill.
	Regards
