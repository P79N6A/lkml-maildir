The kernel interface has finally as stabilized enough I managed to put
some work into the user space side of things.
The new release is at:
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/kexec-tools-1.6.tar.gz
The interface is now more like reboot, so you probably want to change
your shutdown scripts or use kexec --force.
And by default it now enters the kernel in 32bit mode so it should avoid
interrupt controller problems, and work for more people, in more strange
situations.
