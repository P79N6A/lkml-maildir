Not really. Why is =Y supposed to be a factor for duplicate names? The
exact same collision can happen in the =N case. This is exactly the
problem Markus and myself tried to address with
109f0e93b6b728f03c1eb4af02bc25d71b646c59. The i2c-dev class names its
class devices i2c-%d, and the firmware class as well (for i2c devices).
If 109f0e93b6b728f03c1eb4af02bc25d71b646c59 is going to be reverted,
then we will see the same collision again, but only for DEPRECATED=N.
That's rather confusing.
To add to the confusion, it seems that, in some cases, the potential
name collision is addressed by inserting a directory (named after the
class name) between the parent device and the class device. For example:
/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:11.0/i2c-adapter/i2c-0
0000:00:11.0 is the PCI device, i2c-0 is the class device and
i2c-adapter is the class name.
So why isn't it done in all cases? This would solve the problem, as the
colliding class devices would finally get their own namespace:
/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:11.0/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/i2c-dev/i2c-0
/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:11.0/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/firmware/i2c-0

Unfortunately the =N case is the one that will break when you revert
109f0e93b6b728f03c1eb4af02bc25d71b646c59.
