I wonder if it's 9dfa52831e96194b8649613e3131baa2c109f7dc:
     "Merge blk_recount_segments into blk_recalc_rq_segments" ?
That particular commit does some rather innocent code-shuffling,
but also introduces a couple of new "if (nr_hw_segs == 1" conditions
that were not there before.
Okay git experts:  how do I pull out a kernel at the point of this exact commit ?
Thanks!
